### Fierce Battles Erupt in Changzhi and Jincheng Areas; Japanese Invaders Blocked in Shanxi; Japanese Divide Forces to Eye the Suiyuan Baotou Area with Intense Fighting; Xia Wei and Cai Tingkai Inspect Western Guangdong and Re-deploy Defenses

(Chongqing) The fierce battle in Southern Shanxi continues to unfold intensely. The military focus has now shifted to the Changzhi and Jincheng areas. Since the beginning of the month, the Japanese army has mobilized five divisions and one brigade, totaling over 120,000 troops, and launched a massive encirclement of the Taihang Mountains in five routes. The Chinese army has also risen up to meet the enemy in separate engagements. The recent situation on each front is as follows: The main force of over 20,000 Japanese troops advancing south along the Baijin Highway, after successively capturing Huaqin County, Wuxiang, Yushe, and Liaoxian, was attacked by the Chinese army on both sides of the Baijin Highway. Furthermore, a certain Chinese army unit maneuvered behind the Japanese forces and launched a surprise attack, causing the Japanese to collapse and flee south. In addition to recapturing Liaoxian first on the 7th, the Chinese army successively captured Yushe and Wuxiang on the 10th and 11th. The fleeing Japanese troops then entrenched themselves in Xiangyuan. The Chinese army continued to pursue and bombard them. On the 12th, the Japanese troops fled southwest to Xiadian. The Chinese army then captured Xiangyuan. The 2,000 Japanese troops advancing south from Qin County attempted to move directly towards Xiadian, eventually joining forces with the Japanese troops fleeing south from Wuxiang to launch a southward attack. On the 13th, they captured Changzhi. Japanese traces have also been discovered near Yincheng Town south of Changzhi. As for the Japanese troops advancing east along the Hongtun Avenue, they reached Tunliu on the 11th and moved east towards Changzhi. The Chinese army pursued them along the Baijin Highway, causing the Japanese to flee south desperately. At the same time, another Chinese army unit intercepted the rear of the Japanese troops on the Hongtun Highway, posing a significant threat to the Japanese. Furthermore, the main force of over 10,000 Japanese troops advancing east from Yicheng along the Yiqin Highway had their vanguard reach Qinshui by the 13th. Another force, advancing from Zhongcun, Dongfeng, and Yangcheng, engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army on the Yiqin Highway. Currently, the areas of Qinshui, Dongfeng, and Yangcheng are under daily threat of a combined Japanese attack on Jincheng. As for the Japanese troops advancing west along the Bojin Highway in northern Henan, their momentum has been blunted by Chinese army flanking attacks and they have now become quiet. Moreover, the Japanese troops advancing west from Handan, southern Hebei, to Shexian suffered heavy casualties after fighting the Chinese army at Dongyangguan and are now in a standoff. In summary, the Japanese army is still attempting to advance on the Taihang Mountains with multiple forces converging, with their main force advancing east from the Baijin Highway and Yicheng, planning to attack Jincheng. However, the main Chinese forces are meeting the enemy in separate engagements, repeatedly inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese. Currently, the Japanese army has been cut into multiple segments by the Chinese army, and their offensive has reached the end of its strength. Relying on favorable terrain and employing mobile strike tactics, it will not be difficult for the Chinese to shatter their dream of invading the Taihang Mountains, just as they shattered their invasion of the Zhongtiao Mountains.

(Chongqing) According to news from Chinese sources today, although the great battle in southeastern Shanxi Province has been going on for a week, the intensity has not diminished. After the Chinese army recaptured Wuxiang, they advanced victoriously to the south, and on July 12, they recaptured Qin County. It is reported that the Japanese army occupied Changzhi on July 13 and is now eyeing Yuncheng further south. Fighting is currently underway in that area. The Japanese are clearly attempting to strike at Yincheng and Jincheng near the Shanxi-Henan border. One Japanese column advanced east from Yicheng and reportedly reached Dongfeng Bo, west of Yangcheng, on July 14. Another column advanced south from Qinshui, hoping to join forces with the column west of Yangcheng to attack Yangcheng. (19th Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to a spokesman for the Chinese High Command at an intelligence conference yesterday, the Japanese troops attacking Shanxi are now completely stalled. In order to halt the Japanese advance, the Chinese army has employed several methods, first driving the Japanese out of the Zhongtiao Mountain area. The Japanese force of 120,000 troops, divided into five routes, concentrated in central Shanxi, but were blocked by the Chinese army on each front. The new strategy currently adopted by the Chinese army is to immediately encircle a city after it falls. This strategy has been remarkably successful in Tengqing (phonetic), east of Fanshi, and Liaoxian and Yushe, east of Dagu. Before the Japanese army arrives, the Chinese army withdraws from the city according to a predetermined plan, and then immediately besieges the city after the Japanese occupy it. (19th Huitong News Agency dispatch)

(Luoyang) The Japanese troops entrenched in Xinyang, in addition to actively building roads and strengthening fortifications at various strongholds, have been relatively inactive. On the 14th, a number of Japanese infantry suddenly increased at Changtaiguan. On the 15th, the Chinese army launched a lightning strike on Changtaiguan, successively occupying Liujiazhuang and Zhangjiazhuang (both northwest of Changtaiguan). The Japanese army relied on fortifications to hold firm, and fierce fighting lasted all day. Unable to withstand the assault, the Japanese changed tactics, dividing into two routes to harass the Chinese, one from Hedong Zhangcun (south of Changtaiguan) and one from Shiying (southwest of Changtaiguan) and Da Xiaowangzhuang (northeast of Changtaiguan). Currently, the Chinese and Japanese forces are in a standoff in Yangcun. (18th dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to a spokesman for the Chinese army, 700 Japanese infantrymen, 400 cavalrymen, and 58 tanks attacked Shatingjiafang (phonetic) near Baotou, western Suiyuan, yesterday. The Chinese army put up the strongest resistance, and the fierce fighting was exceptionally intense. (19th Huitong News Agency dispatch)

(Hong Kong) After many days of quiet on the upper and lower reaches of the West River, Xia Wei and Cai Tingkai recently inspected the West River and have redeployed defenses. Deng Longguang remains on the front line, in command of military affairs. Fierce fighting continues near Jiangmen and Xinhui. In eastern Guangdong, the Chinese side has dispatched new mechanized troops to reinforce defenses. (19th special dispatch)

Wengyuan On the 12th, a Chinese guerrilla unit attacked Dongguan City. The Japanese army put up a stubborn resistance but were defeated and retreated after a fierce assault by the Chinese army. There are no Japanese troops in the city now. (18th dispatch)

Zhaoqing Over 200 Japanese troops from Sanshui attacked Yangmei along the Zhexil Highway (Zhebao to Southwest) at dawn on the 16th but were ambushed by Chinese self-defense forces and fled in disarray. The Japanese left behind many corpses, military rice, and military supplies. (18th dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to reports received by the Chinese army here, fierce fighting is still ongoing in Shantou. The Japanese army is attempting to cut off transportation between Shantou, Chenghai, and Chaoan, but has not succeeded. Chenghai is still in Chinese hands, and the Chinese army has also stormed into Chaoan, resulting in fierce hand-to-hand combat. (19th Huitong News Agency dispatch)

Liuhuang After the Chinese army recaptured Chaoan on the evening of the 16th, the Japanese troops in Fengxi, Fuyang, Yinhu, Hecao, and other places also retreated upon hearing the news. On the morning of the 17th, the Japanese dispatched over 200 infantry, artillery, and mules and horses from Shantou to reinforce, but were intercepted by the Chinese army, suffering hundreds of casualties. The Chinese army then decided that it had already achieved a significant victory at this point and had destroyed all the Japanese fortifications. Therefore, on the evening of the 17th, they voluntarily abandoned Chao City. (18th dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to military news received here today, a small number of Japanese remnants, including several high-ranking officers, are now holed up in the Yingzhou Hotel in Chaozhou City, stubbornly defending their position. At the same time, the Japanese troops who have been expelled from Chaozhou are now based at Jinshan and Lushan (both phonetic) south of the city. The Japanese have dispatched planes from Shantou to reinforce the besieged Japanese troops in the Chaozhou urban area. Six Japanese warships appeared off Shanwei yesterday morning, and eight Japanese planes were scouting the sky, likely intending to land troops. (19th Reuters dispatch)

Lianghe On the morning of the 15th, the Chinese army launched an attack on the Japanese troops at Changtaiguan with irresistible force. At 7:00 AM, they occupied Fenhui and Yuzhuang, and at 8:00 AM, they recaptured Baozhuang and Weijiazhuang. The Japanese troops relied on the fortifications of Changtaiguan to stubbornly resist. The Chinese army charged and killed many times, killing countless Japanese troops. Around 2:00 PM, the Japanese divided their forces into two units, attempting to attack the flanks of the Chinese army, but were severely beaten and fled back. Currently, they are still in a standoff. (19th dispatch)

(Jizhou) On the 9th, the Chinese army in southern Hebei launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops in Qingfeng. The Japanese troops immediately came out of the city to meet the attack. The Chinese army ambushed its main force near the outskirts of the city, while a portion feigned a retreat. The Japanese troops followed, and when the Japanese troops were far from the city, the main force of the Chinese army stormed into the city, while another portion fiercely attacked the rear of the Japanese army. The Japanese troops were frightened and fled north in disarray, and Qingfeng City was recaptured. (19th dispatch)

Editorial

### International Phenomena and Great Britain

The struggle between the two major international blocs is evolving with time. Due to the delay in establishing an anti-aggression front, the aggression group is particularly arrogant. In the Far East, negotiations in Tokyo are taking place amidst a heated anti-British movement, demanding that Britain yield without a fight. In Central and Eastern Europe, Hitler is deliberately seizing Danzig and threatening the small countries of the Baltic Sea while simultaneously launching domestic newspapers and magazines to fiercely attack Britain. In the Mediterranean, Spain has won its internal strife with foreign aid and is already heavily constrained. Recently, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Franco is clearly aimed at intensifying control over Spain and further threatening Britain in terms of military strategy. At the same time, Gaeda, the spokesman for the Black Shirt Prime Minister, has also threatened to abolish the Anglo-Italian Agreement, which exists in name only. All of this, simultaneously evolving into three different types of offensives, is by no means accidental or localized, but an organic and coordinated strategy. The exorbitant demands in the Tokyo negotiations hope to pressure Britain to make concessions to Germany and Italy on the Polish or Mediterranean issues. The crisis in Central and Eastern Europe or the waves in the Mediterranean will undoubtedly raise Japan's bargaining power. What is most noteworthy here is that the three offensives all target Britain as a common and direct object. This is very clear, not because Britain is the weakest, but because Britain is the most prone to compromise and the easiest to subdue.

The current sharpening of the international crisis is certainly not a sudden occurrence, but a consequence of the superficial ease and comfort and avoidance of difficulty and seeking only peace of Great Britain and other democracies after the Great War. At the time of the "September 18th Incident," Britain actually rejected the proposal of the United States. In 1937, Britain signed the Munich Agreement, and as a result, the arrogance of aggression surged, and the international crisis was prolonged and expanded. In the Far East, the aggressors, without any scruples, advanced north and south, occupying Hainan Island and the Xinnan Islands, completing the initial layout in the Pacific Ocean, and further threatening the interests of Britain, France, and the United States. In Europe, the Czech Republic disappeared from the map, Memel was annexed, the Spanish Republic was painted with the color of fascism, Albania was destroyed, and Hitler, following in the footsteps of Wilhelm II, mounted the wild horse of eastward expansion (towards the Near East). The Mediterranean will become the "inner lake" of the Black Shirt Prime Minister because General Franco guards the gate. The lessons of these facts have made Chamberlain aware of the need to change course and begin to build an anti-aggression front, uniting with France, and successively wooing Poland, Romania, and Turkey, and negotiating mutual assistance with the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, because Britain's sincerity in abandoning its policy of appeasement has not been established, the horror of the Soviet Union's past international policies vaguely permeates the Baltic coast and other small countries in Europe. Moreover, the Soviet Union is gradually deepening its use of stubborn and cold tactics towards Britain to probe the maximum extent of Britain's concessions to the Soviet Union. Because of all these reasons, the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have reached a stalemate to this day. The most important link in the international anti-aggression front has not been established to this day, and the aggression group is even more rampant.

Under the fierce attack of the eastern and western aggression waves, how will Mr. Chamberlain, the helmsman, deal with it? According to Reuters, Mr. Chamberlain said in the House of Commons the day before yesterday that he had clearly rejected Japan's attempt to "pressure Britain to change its Far Eastern policy." Secondly, Mr. Ironside, an important British military leader, has arrived in Warsaw to conduct military talks with countries on the anti-aggression front. Thirdly, London authorities are conducting diplomatic talks with representatives of South Bulgaria, and it is rumored that they at least hope that South Bulgaria will not be used by the aggression group. At the same time, London has issued new instructions for the British ambassador to the Soviet Union to continue the nearly frozen negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Judging from the above points, it can be seen that the arrival of the new international crisis has spurred Chamberlain to move forward, which is a gratifying phenomenon. What we cannot rest assured about is that Britain has been deeply poisoned by empty and formal internationalism, and has almost lost its independent national policy and the new vigor of its nation as a result. Therefore, after being stimulated, its forward-looking posture may still hesitate to wait for so-called common international actions and parallel actions. The coldness of the Soviet Union and the unrest in American domestic politics are particularly sufficient to discourage those who lack determination. In fact, hesitating and wavering is tantamount to rewarding evil, not only wasting previous efforts, but also causing endless troubles in the future. Courageous advancement will not only cause the demons to disappear due to Britain's strength, but also prevent the world from sitting idly by and allowing Britain to be the only one to suffer sacrifices, because of the common interests of the international community. China has been fighting alone for two years, and international sympathy and assistance are increasing day by day. If Britain can independently move forward on the anti-aggression front, then not only will France, Turkey, Poland, and the Baltic states immediately use their full strength to support it, but other countries will also sincerely assist it. Britain seems to expect something from the United States and the Soviet Union, but in our observation, only Britain's active advancement is the most effective way to motivate the United States and the Soviet Union!

### Government Maintains Legal Tender; Policy Remains Unchanged; Statement from Finance Ministry Spokesperson

(Chongqing) Regarding the recent foreign exchange turmoil in Shanghai, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance issued the following statement today:

The Chinese government's policy for the legal tender remains its original maintenance, in order to be consistent with the national economy and to have a monetary system that can freely supply legitimate trade. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly made statements and announcements on this point, and there have been no changes to date. Since the outbreak of the war, the government has striven to provide legal trade with foreign exchange convenience. Before March 1938, foreign exchange could be freely bought and sold according to the exchange rate set by the government. However, since the establishment of the puppet North China Preparation Bank under Japanese control in March, the government had to restrict the management of foreign exchange. However, it still tried to allocate necessary foreign exchange. Later, the Japanese attempts to destroy the legal tender became even more numerous. In addition to issuing a large number of Japanese military yen and puppet North China United Preparation Bank banknotes, it also issued the so-called puppet Huaxing Bank banknotes. As a result, the amount of banknotes in circulation suddenly increased, and the issue of China's currency value also became more complicated. In addition, the Japanese side extracted legal tender in the Japanese-occupied areas by collecting legal tender from the people, using customs revenue, and other methods, and exchanged it for foreign exchange. At the same time, it also absorbed a large number of China's export goods by means of purchase or purchase with counterfeit money, and converted them into foreign exchange. Therefore, the amount of foreign exchange that was sufficient for all needs in peacetime has decreased as a result. At the same time, a large number of non-essential goods are imported into the country, most of which are transported to the occupied areas. Although the government has recently issued an order prohibiting the import of such goods, importers are still pouring in, and some of them are even supplied to the Japanese military. China's main trade was originally domestic commerce, the amount of which far exceeds foreign trade. The decline in the exchange rate caused by enemy aggression and speculator manipulation is regrettable. However, the difficulty we have in purchasing foreign goods, as well as the temporary decline in foreign exchange prices, does not have a serious impact on China's overall economic situation. I still remember that ten years ago, the value of the US dollar was once lower than the Chinese silver dollar, and one pound sterling was only worth about four Chinese national currencies. However, the United Kingdom and the United States did not show any signs of this at that time. In order to facilitate all parties to purchase their most needed goods from abroad, the Chinese government will continue to approve the allocation of a large amount of foreign exchange. The measures and purposes announced by the government at the beginning of this month are not only to enable the people to purchase their most needed goods and increase China's productivity to meet current needs, but also to promote the production of domestic export goods and encourage merchants to increase export trade. The various measures announced by the government have now been implemented one by one, and the result will also enhance the country's economic strength, which is why it will enhance its ability to resist Japan. (19th dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to news from here this afternoon, Washio, the deputy governor of the "Huaxing Bank," is currently in Tokyo, discussing with the "China Bureau" of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and has decided to maintain the exchange rate of the "Huaxing Bank's" banknotes at six pence per pound sterling at all costs, in order to ensure that the banknotes can circulate in the Central China area.

### Unified Gold Bonds; Interest Payments Suspended

(Chongqing) According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance, it has been decided to suspend interest payments on the Unified Gold Bonds, which are due on July 31. This decision was clarified in the Ministry of Finance's declaration on January 15 of this year. The declaration stated that for all bonds whose principal and interest are guaranteed by customs duties, the principal and interest will be suspended uniformly when the customs duties are withheld by the Japanese. However, the government will not object if bondholders discount interest coupons in banks. (19th Associated Press dispatch)

### New China; National Power Strong

(London) At a meeting of the Fuzhong Corporation yesterday, General Woodrow, chairman and general manager, delivered a speech saying that a new China with new unity and spirit has emerged.

The factories in the war zone have also been rebuilt in the southwestern provinces. This new China in the southwestern provinces has an area of 1.5 million square kilometers and a population of 150 million, which will prove to be stronger than the old China. (19th Reuters dispatch)

### Qiao Jingzhi; Dies for His Country

Xi'an Qiao Jingzhi, deputy commander of the Suiyuan People's Anti-Japanese Army, since the beginning of the war, mobilized the people of Suiyuan, organized a strong anti-Japanese force, and coordinated with various units in combat, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese. Many puppet troops in Suiyuan also automatically defected to join. The anti-Japanese momentum of the unit was extremely vast, and it was a powerful vanguard army on the Northwest Front. The Japanese had gathered their main force several times to besiege the unit in the D青山 Mountains, but the Japanese army was miserably defeated. On June 14, in a desperate battle with the Japanese army in Gugutuo'an Village, Qingshuihe County, the Japanese army suffered more than 500 casualties. Subsequently, Japanese reinforcements greatly increased, and tanks also assisted in the battle. Qiao still commanded his troops to charge bravely, but was captured by the Japanese army after injuring both legs. After arguing with the Japanese army for a long time, he died heroically. Qiao was 39 years old and a native of Qingshuihe County, Suiyuan. He fought against Japan many times, and his battle achievements were remarkable. His great ambitions were not fulfilled, and he died for his country. All who heard this were extremely saddened. (17th dispatch)

### British Side Denies Spier Has Been Tried

(Beiping) The spokesman of the Japanese military here today gave a clearer indication on the current situation of the British military attaché Spier, who is still being detained in Zhangjiakou. The spokesman denied the rumors from Tokyo that Spier had been tried, and said that although the Japanese side admitted that Spier was a military attaché of the embassy and had a certain diplomatic status, the crux of the case at present was whether Spier had exceeded the scope of his diplomatic duties and rights. The spokesman implied that if it was discovered that Spier had done something unfavorable to the Japanese army, it would be difficult to recognize his diplomatic status. The spokesman also said that he did not know whether the trial would be public or secret. When asked whether the Japanese side should invite a British official to attend the trial as an observer, the spokesman replied that he hoped to do so, and said that he approved of foreigners attending Spier's court-martial. (19th Reuters dispatch)

(London) Undersecretary Butler today replied in the House of Commons to questions about the detention of British military attaché Spier by the Japanese authorities in Zhangjiakou, saying that Sir Craigie, the British ambassador to Japan, had inquired about the matter with the Japanese government and was awaiting a reply. The nature of the Japanese reply will inevitably affect any action by the British government. Conservative MP Major General Knox rose to speak, saying that it was unheard of for diplomats stationed in foreign countries to attempt to handle things in this way. Are we unable to take any truly practical economic action to make the Japanese government realize this? Butler replied that all of his previous answers showed the importance that the British government attached to this matter. Knox could conclude that the British government would give serious consideration to the Japanese response. Sinclair, the leader of the Liberal Party, continued to speak, saying that since Spier had been detained for so long, more practical action should be taken. Fletcher of the Labour Party also asked whether the British government had specifically mentioned the issue of Spier's diplomatic privileges to the Japanese government. Butler replied that the government had given full consideration to this point, and that there were various special circumstances to be considered regarding the issue of diplomatic privileges. Major General Knox asked again when the British government first protested about this matter. Butler replied that a protest would be lodged immediately. (19th Reuters dispatch)

### Japanese Agitation; Anti-British Movement

(Tianjin) According to the Japanese military newspaper Tianjin Yongbao, the "authorities" are now urging the Chinese in Tianjin to do their best to take various anti-British actions. The methods used are many: one is to increase the Chinese people's dislike of the British, two is to hinder the commercial relations between the Chinese and the British, three is to establish a special court to handle lawsuits between Chinese merchants and British merchants, and four is to persuade workers working for the British to quickly leave the British and let the "authorities" find other ways to settle them. Foreigners here believe that the Japanese establishment of a special court to handle Chinese-British affairs is intended to harm the British. (19th Associated Press dispatch)

(Beiping) According to Chinese newspapers, the local government of Dezhou, which is supported by the Japanese, has recently ordered the police to investigate all British goods in Dezhou in order to start rejecting them.

### 13th Dalai Lama's Reincarnation Found. Born in a Tibetan Family Near塔尔寺. Has been escorted by a commissioner to depart back to Tibet

Lanzhou. The thirteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet has passed away for five years, and the reincarnation and inheritance issue that attracts worldwide attention will soon be resolved. The reincarnation of the thirteenth Dalai Lama (ie, the fourteenth Dalai Lama to be enthroned) has been found in Qinghai and has departed from塔尔寺 in Qinghai on the 13th of this month, escorted by the commissioner Ma Yuanhai and Tibetan search commissioner. The central government has allocated 100,000 yuan for the escort. Beforehand, the Central News Agency reporter inquired about everything from all parties. Around noon one day, the reporter arrived at the temple. The affairs were taken care of by the Mongolian and Tibetan Committee member and the former Panchen Lama’s representative to Beijing, Zhu Haishan, and others. The Dalai Lama’s reincarnation was born in a local family in Hongtu Cliff, near塔尔寺, with the secular name Lama Danzhu, five years old, with a prominent head and calm manner. His eyes are especially piercing and bright. On that day, he wore a purple monk robe, a monk hat, and black long-barreled small leather boots. Because he was not fluent in Mandarin, he only replied to the reporter’s age. Most of the other questions were answered with a shake of his head. After the reporter’s interview, the group went to the courtyard to take a photo. As a five-year-old child, the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation was surrounded by many unfamiliar guests for more than an hour, maintaining a calm and innocent attitude without any signs of nervousness. It shows that he was born with a special gift, so he can be dignified and calm. The Tibetan commissioner happened to enter the city that day to discuss escort matters with the Qinghai Provincial Government and was unable to visit. According to the results of the reporter’s interviews with Commissioner Zhu Haishan and other related parties familiar with the situation in Tibet, the following is a summary: When the thirteenth Dalai Lama passed away, he left a will regarding the direction and characteristics of the reincarnation. His Khenpo disciples followed the will and went to the sea more than 300 miles from Lhasa to observe the characteristics. At that time, the sea showed (1) a complex ethnic group with different costumes; (2) three Tibetan characters, meaning塔尔寺. Because塔尔寺 is the most ethnically complex place in China, it has always been the focus of ethnic [missing character]. The Dalai Lama’s disciples immediately followed the will and sent a commissioner to Qinghai to search for the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. The commissioner arrived in Gannin the year before last. The Panchen Lama happened to be stationed there and gave instructions on finding the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. The commissioner followed the instructions and rushed to Qinghai. In a local family in Hongtu Cliff, they found the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation and immediately reported to the central government and Tibet. They invited the reincarnation to塔尔寺, where his brother was a lama and took care of his daily life. The central government ordered the Qinghai Provincial Government to jointly handle the escort back to Tibet, which is now ready. It began on the 13th. Tibetan personnel and search commissioner are very impressed that the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation was found near塔尔寺, which is in line with the Dalai Lama’s will. This return to Tibet will surely be supported by the masses as the fourteenth Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama has reincarnated for thirteen generations. The fifth Dalai Lama had the highest morality and knowledge. The thirteenth Dalai Lama had the most political and religious power. The fifth Dalai Lama was intelligent, upright, and deeply [missing character] understood cause and effect. He once made a prophecy to his disciples, saying that (if the fourteenth Dalai Lama reincarnates in Qinghai, his morality and knowledge will be even higher than the fifth Dalai Lama). Now that the fourteenth Dalai Lama has been found in Qinghai, people have high hopes for the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation, expecting him to arrive in Tibet safely, receive a good education, and have profound knowledge. They also hope that the Tibetan regent authorities and Tibetan compatriots will follow the will of the thirteenth Dalai Lama and let the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation inherit the throne and properly assist him, so that the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation can become an adult and govern, with the country and the nation as the most important. Make Tibet closely linked with the central government, forming a relationship of interdependence, in order to consolidate the border. The future of the country and the nation is deeply beneficial.

### Craigie and Arita Continued Negotiations Yesterday, Each Stating Opinions on the Tianjin Case, Japanese Side Claims Situation Slightly Improved

(Tokyo) British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie and Foreign Minister Arita met twice at the Foreign Minister's official residence today to discuss the general issues forming the background of the Tianjin Incident. A final decision meeting will be held on Friday to allow both sides sufficient time to consider unresolved issues. Today's two meetings lasted a total of four and a half hours. The first meeting was in the morning. The British Ambassador, accompanied by his wife, arrived at the Foreign Minister's official residence by car at 9 a.m. and left after three and a half hours. The discussion resumed at 4:50 p.m. and ended at 6:10 p.m. According to a statement released by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Bureau at 7:10 p.m., "Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie continued to discuss the general issues forming the background of the Tianjin Incident at the Foreign Minister's official residence from 4:50 p.m. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 p.m. and it was decided to meet again on Friday to allow both sides sufficient time for consideration." The British Embassy also issued a similar statement. According to Japanese sources, the atmosphere of this afternoon's meeting was not much different from that of the morning. The British Ambassador still maintained a friendly attitude, but still insisted on the British demands. Compared with the meeting this morning, there was no progress to be made. The outcome of this meeting cannot be guaranteed to be optimistic, but it cannot be said that it is without hope. When the British Ambassador and Foreign Minister Arita met for the first time last Saturday, it was agreed that due to the hot weather, they would wear casual clothes during the meeting, so today's meeting was conducted in the same way. Foreign Minister Arita wore a gray casual suit, and the British Ambassador wore white. It is heard that Arita even suggested to the British Ambassador that he could take off his coat during the discussion. (Reuters, 19th)

(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Bureau issued a communiqué this afternoon stating that the second British-Japanese negotiation was held at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 9 a.m. this morning. British Ambassador Craigie presented the British government's views on the general issues forming the background of the Tianjin Incident. At the same time, Foreign Minister Arita also explained the Japanese side's views in detail. It is reliably learned that although the British domestic opinion is adopting a tough attitude towards the British-Japanese negotiations, the British Ambassador's attitude was very mild during the talks this morning, so the future of the negotiations is not pessimistic. The meeting was adjourned at 12:15 p.m. and resumed at 4 p.m. The British Ambassador took advantage of this break to secretly discuss the progress of the negotiations with the British Consul in Tianjin. (Wire report, 19th)

(Tokyo) At 9 a.m. this morning, British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie went to Foreign Minister Arita's official residence by car to continue the talks. It is expected that the British Ambassador will frankly explain Britain's views on the general principles of the background of the Tianjin Incident held by Arita, and it is expected that the British Ambassador will solemnly declare the neutrality of the British Concession and demand the protection of British interests. (Reuters, 19th) The British government telegraphed new instructions to British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie last night. The British Ambassador plans to continue negotiations with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on the Tianjin Incident today. The British Cabinet also plans to hold a meeting today to discuss the Tokyo negotiations and the deadlock in the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union on the conclusion of a British-French-Soviet military alliance, etc. The latest news received here indicates that when Arita and the British Ambassador to Japan had their first meeting last week, they cleverly raised the entire issue of British aid to China. The method used was to avoid mentioning various related American disputes so that Britain could not demand that the United States intervene. It is said that Arita's request was to isolate Britain without assistance. (Associated Press, 19th)

(Chongqing) The Chinese newspapers here are still paying close attention to the progress of the British-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo and pointing out the great disparity in the opinions of the British and Japanese sides. They also attach importance to the British newspapers' advocacy that the scope of the Tokyo negotiations should be limited to local issues in Tianjin. This morning, the Chongqing United Daily News editorial discussed the need to promote a collective security system in the Far East, saying that the actions of the German-Italian-Japanese axis are closely coordinated with each other. Everyone knows that developments in the Far East are shifting with the European situation, and it should also be known that the European situation is being influenced by developments in the Far East. If the Western countries do not know how to promote a collective security system in the Far East, then their future destiny will be even worse than what they are currently encountering. (Reuters, 19th) Japanese newspapers have commented on the talks between Foreign Minister Arita and Ambassador Craigie. It is said that Craigie believes that the preconditions put forward by the Japanese side are two: First, Britain must recognize that the current Sino-Japanese hostile acts are combat operations. In other words, although China and Japan have not declared war, Britain must recognize the existence of a state of war. Second, Britain must adopt strict neutrality. The British Concession must carefully prevent all anti-Japanese actions and all acts that directly or indirectly hinder Japanese military operations must be stopped. Japanese political figures believe that Ambassador Craigie has recently been instructed by Prime Minister Chamberlain to prepare to recognize the state of war. However, although Britain intends to change its anti-Japanese policy, it is unwilling to declare the abandonment of its privileges in the Far East. As for the Japanese side, its attitude towards Britain remains unchanged and it is unwilling to compromise. (Haitong Wire, 19th)

### French Parliamentarian Discusses Far East Situation, Advises Britain and France to Resolutely Resist Japan

(Paris) French far-right parliamentarian Cléry published an article in Le Temps today entitled "The Time for Counterattack Has Arrived." The article discusses the situation in the Far East and advises Britain and France to take strong steps against Japan. Cléry believes that the British-Japanese negotiations currently being held in Tokyo may not have good results. Britain and France must confront Japan and not give in. In retaliation, Japan may seize the British and French concessions in China. However, if Britain and France do not resist Japan, they will not be able to retain the concessions in the end. To seek complete preservation is unattainable. (Haitong Wire, 19th)

### US Republican Leader Suggests Abolishing US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and Reopening the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to Remove Obstacles to the Pittman Bill

(Washington) Today, Republican leader Vandenberg introduced a resolution in the Senate requiring the government to give Japan six months' notice to abolish the Treaty of Amity and Commerce signed between the US and Japan in 1911. The purpose of this move is obviously to remove obstacles to the resolution proposed by Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Pittman's resolution proposes authorizing the President to restrict the transportation of military supplies to any country that violates the Nine-Power Treaty. Secretary of State Hull has now, at the request of the committee, considered Pittman's resolution, which clashes with several clauses of the 1911 treaty. Vandenberg's resolution further calls for reconvening the 1937 Beijing Conference to determine whether Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty respecting China's integrity. (Reuters, 18th)

(Washington) Michigan Republican Senator Vandenberg recently submitted a bill to the Senate stating that the US-Japan trade agreement is no longer suitable for the current situation and should be declared abolished immediately so that it loses its effect after six months (according to this agreement, signed in 1911, one of the signatory countries may declare its abolition six months in advance), and a new one should be negotiated based on new foundations. In addition, the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries' meeting held in Brussels in 1937 should be reconvened to review whether Japan has destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty in the past and whether it is continuing to destroy it now. According to Vandenberg, the above-mentioned bill has been sent to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for review. (Havas Agency, 18th)

### Roosevelt No Longer Insisting on His Opinion on the US Neutrality Act, Result of Meeting with Senate Leaders

(Washington) According to news from the United Press, President Roosevelt has now abandoned his efforts to amend the Neutrality Act in this session of Congress. The President made this decision after discussing the situation with the Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate. The President and Secretary of State Hull both stressed the current crisis in Europe and said that the Senate's failure to decide on the Neutrality Act would frustrate the United States' exercise of its potential power to guide peace. (Reuters, 19th)

(London) A Reuters Washington correspondent learned that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull both clearly explained their views on the current war crisis in Europe. This view is based on reliable reports from American diplomatic representatives stationed in Europe. Well-informed sources in Washington believe that President Roosevelt will use this situation to speak to the American people when he travels to the American West this summer. At the same time, the Republican Party seems unwilling to be drawn into a position of embracing isolation, thereby giving the Democratic Party the benefit of the 1940 election campaign, so it is expected that when the next session of Congress convenes, the neutrality issue will be resolved with a free vote unconstrained by party guidelines. (Reuters, 19th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt had a three-hour conversation with the Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate. After the conversation, the Senate leaders issued two statements expressing the views of the majority of Senators, who did not want to make any decisions on neutrality policy during the current session of Congress, but would like to discuss it again during the next session of Congress (ie, next January). The White House also issued a statement afterwards, roughly saying that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have always believed that if the US Senate does not make a decision at this time, it will weaken the United States' power to influence world peace, at least in the period between today and next January. Also, according to White House Secretary 区莱君, the statement issued by the Senate is intended to ask the President not to discuss the Neutrality Act during the current session of Congress, but to rather sit and watch the European situation become tense. Because the President and Secretary of State both believe that if the US Neutrality Act is not amended, the European situation may become tense, but most Senators believe that it may not be tense before this winter. According to 区莱言, the US President's and Secretary of State's joint appeal on the Neutrality Act issue has received enthusiastic support from all parties, and there has also been an unfavorable reaction to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's delay. Finally, 区莱言 stated that, to my knowledge, the government's Neutrality Act has not only been supported by the entire American diplomatic apparatus, but also by the US Army and Navy. (Associated Press, 19th)

(Washington) According to Michigan Republican Congressman Crawford, speaking to an Associated Press reporter last night, the Pittman bill to deal with Japan may not be passed by this session of Congress. 克氏 also submitted a bill to ban the shipment of goods to Japan. 克氏 further stated that the decision for Congress to adjourn early and Pittman's proposal must be postponed for discussion at the next session. According to 克氏, the majority of the American people support Roosevelt and Hull's recommendation to abolish the Neutrality Act's arms embargo. 克氏 also said, "In the next Congress, the Neutrality Act may be amended according to the government's urgent request. At that time, the American people will be able to express their beliefs. Currently, the American people feel the need to prohibit the transportation of military supplies to Japan. This sentiment is increasing. In the next Congress, general anti-Japanese public opinion will inevitably force Congress to adopt the Pittman bill." According to 克氏's prediction, unless Japan withdraws from China, the US will definitely take action against Japan. The American people are very dissatisfied with the anti-British movement instigated by the Japanese because they have realized that if the anti-British movement is created, the Japanese will definitely start an anti-American movement. 克氏 concluded by saying that if the Japanese further disrupt the situation in the Far East, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the American people will increase, and Pittman's and his personal anti-Japanese bills will definitely be passed as a result.

### British and French Automotive Giants Initiate Fundraising to Send Personnel to China to Treat Wounded Soldiers and Civilians

(London) British automotive giant Nuffield recently launched a fundraising campaign to raise funds to send a disability relief team to China to treat wounded soldiers and civilians. He said, "The British Society for the Treatment of Disability has now received a telegram from the Chinese Red Cross stating that it intends to establish a disability hospital in the rear and asking the Society to raise funds and find surgeons to work there. After these surgeons arrive in China, in addition to engaging in treatment, they will also train surgeons locally to teach them disability surgery in order to benefit wounded soldiers and civilians in China. The Society for the Treatment of Disability and other medical societies have already donated £1,200. "As an honorary member of the Society, I have always been enthusiastic about this righteous cause. I am donating £500 and hope that philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously so that we can see its success as soon as possible." (Havas, 19th)

### Washington's Observations: European War Imminent, Hitler Intends to Seize Danzig, Serious Incidents Could Be Triggered at Any Time

(New York) According to a report from the New York Times, President Roosevelt issued a warning about the danger of the European situation at a meeting with Republican and Democratic senators at the White House last night, saying that the European situation is more dangerous than generally speculated. Hitler could launch a wave of war on any day, any week, or any month. Congress is currently not considering the Neutrality Act. If a war breaks out in Europe, members of Congress will be recalled to Washington for a special meeting in the summer. After meeting with the President, US Ambassador to Belgium Davis told reporters that he was not optimistic about the situation. If the United States does not use all its spiritual power to support Britain and France, the future situation in Europe will be very sad. Davis issued two warnings to reporters: (1) Hitler will seize Danzig if he is not restrained by the power of the United States; (2) After Danzig is annexed, a new division of Poland will follow. Hitler will be the main figure in the partition of Poland, and Stalin may also be so. (3) If Hitler is encouraged by a victory in the Far East, he will shift his attention to Western European countries, and the bombing of Paris and London, which has long been feared, will shock the world. (Reuters, 19th)

(Paris) Officials here received a report from Germany last night stating that Germany will have one million troops "ready to strike" by August 15th. Military movements throughout Germany are hectic. Thousands of troops are leaving barracks for designated areas. Each regimental number is concealed by various objects. According to official information, the number of armed reserve troops in Germany has reached one million by the end of this month. The German harvest has been accelerated so that farmers can engage in military service. Fortresses along the Rhine are being built urgently and can be completed within the next few days. Germany has ordered the Blackshirts and Stormtroopers to end their holidays before August 10th. Well-informed sources believe that the emergency will begin on August 15th and gradually intensify until the end of September, because Germany hopes that the annual heavy snow will arrive at that time to prevent France from attacking Germany through the Alps. Well-informed sources also believe that Germany is trying to create the impression that force will be used to resolve the European problem. In fact, Germany does not want to cause a war.

### Danzig Takes Military Measures to Turn the Entire City into a Strong Fortress

Warsaw. According to news received here, the authorities of the Free City of Danzig are now openly taking military measures to turn the city into a strong fortress. All schools in the city are garrisoned by German troops. Artillery exercises were held in the vicinity today. At this time, anti-aircraft guns are installed on the peaks near the city and on public buildings in the city, and heavy artillery is installed at various military points. The purpose of all these measures is nothing more than to resist attacks by Polish troops in the event of a conflict, so that German troops from East Prussia will not be intercepted by Polish troops when they enter the city. (Havas Agency, 18th)

### Poland Reissues Statement: No Changes Allowed to the Status Quo in Danzig

Warsaw. According to an official communiqué released here today, Polish politicians will regard any attempt by Germany to annex Danzig, regardless of the form it takes, as a violation of the current political and legal status quo and will provoke a corresponding response. Poland's issuance of the above communiqué is due to suggestions from overseas to elect Hitler as chairman of the Danzig Senate. At the same time, German politicians in Berlin deny that Germany's attitude towards the Danzig affair has eased. Anti-Polish propaganda in Berlin newspapers is still extremely intense. (Reuters, 19th)

Danzig. Since the Polish authorities carried out various military preparations near Danzig, it has attracted attention from all parties. It is known that Polish engineers are also installing landmines on the highway between Hobe Ndorf and Eggers Gut on the border of Danzig to prevent emergencies. (Haitong Wire, 19th)

Warsaw. The Polish "Western Border Association" held mass rallies in various places yesterday, demanding that East Prussia (now German territory) be incorporated into Poland. Captain Szumielewski gave a speech in the town of Grudziadz, declaring that the Polish flag will soon be raised over Königsberg, the capital of East Prussia, and other towns in East Prussia. At a mass rally in Bydgoszcz, speakers stressed that Danzig must belong to Poland because Poland needs a naval base. They also advocated that all land inhabited by Poles outside the current territory of Poland should be incorporated into the Polish Republic in the future. This proposal was subsequently adopted by the conference as a resolution. (Haitong Wire, 19th)

### The Greater Ukrainian Nation Building Movement; German Conspiracies Emerge One After Another

Prague - Foreign observers here claim that the Ukrainian issue will soon become a theme of German propaganda. The Slovak intelligence agency frequently issues information mentioning the Ukrainian issue, and newspapers in the Protectorate of Moravia-Bohemia reprint it. Former Prime Minister of Carpathian Ukraine, Voloshyn, and cabinet member Revay have established offices in the Slovak capital and have been active in Berlin, Vienna, and other places. Furthermore, a certain Slovak radio station may be allocated for use by Ukrainians for propaganda purposes. All of these points can prove that Slovakia will become the base for the establishment of the Greater Ukrainian movement, which is not necessarily impossible to predict. (Havas News Agency, 18th)

### The Key to European Peace and War Lies in Germany's Attitude

(London) Britain is adopting a large-scale peace offensive, forcing Germany to choose between peace and war. Whether this is possible is being discussed privately by Conservative Party members, who hope that German public opinion will eventually influence the country's policies and move towards moderation. Although all sectors in Britain recognize that the war crisis has not yet been eliminated and that Britain's expansion of armaments cannot be neglected, they also advocate finding a way to alleviate this burden. Financial and industrial circles also believe that a large part of the country's resources and income are currently being used to prepare for war, and this situation should not be allowed to continue indefinitely. Therefore, Conservative Party members privately advocate that financial aid could be provided to Germany to (1) transform Germany's wartime industry into a peacetime industry, (2) restore the country's currency to a normal and free basis, and (3) supply the country with various raw materials. After the implementation of these proposals, Germany would no longer be able to portray itself as a "poor country" and should reduce armaments as an exchange condition. As for Germany's refusal to accept, it will be clear to the world that Führer Hitler is unwilling to compromise and only values force. Diplomatic circles do not attach importance to this plan, considering it too simplistic, and say that Führer Hitler is concerned with political issues, not economic issues. (Wahas News Agency, 18th)

### Italian Foreign Minister Returns to Rome; Franco Invited to Italy in September

Madrid - Italian Foreign Minister Ciano recently made a statement in Rome, saying that Spanish General Franco will visit Italy soon. According to the official Italian mouthpiece, Foreign Information, Franco will go to Italy at the end of September to thank the Italian people for their enthusiasm for the new Spain.

### Germany, Italy, and Japan in Another Collusion; Mayors of Berlin and Rome Invited to Visit Tokyo

(Tokyo) It was recently announced here that Tokyo Mayor Yoshiyasu Katsura has sent a letter inviting Berlin Mayor Dr. Lippert and Rome Mayor Prince Colonna to come to Tokyo to discuss the organization of the "United Capitals of Anti-Communist Countries Association."

### One Hundred British Bombers Practice Second Flight to France; Fly Over Paris at High Speed; British-Polish Military Talks Began Yesterday

(London) A number of Wellington bombers and other aircraft, a total of one hundred, flew to France today for a second flight practice. Aviation Undersecretary Balfour was also one of the bomber crew members. Several aircraft flew around French territory and returned to their base in Britain three hours after departure. The rest are expected to return this afternoon. Several aircraft flew over Paris at great speed and altitude. Two teams will fly to Avallon, which is still one hundred and twenty miles from Paris, encountering bad weather along the way. (Reuters, 19th)

(Paris) News here today is that the French Air Force authorities have drafted a plan to dispatch one hundred bombers to Britain at any time or tonight. This flight is the initial work of an "invasion" training exercise and will be used to test the soundness of the new British air defense organization. (Associated Press, 19th)

(London) Aircraft belonging to the British Air Force will fly to France again in the next two or three days for non-stop practice flights. The light bombers will turn back after reaching central France, while the heavy bombers will fly to the port of Marseille before flying back. The Air Ministry keeps the flight routes of the aircraft secret and will only disclose them at the last minute before the departure of the aircraft to simulate wartime conditions. The public is very interested in this and is eagerly awaiting the arrival of French aircraft in Britain. In addition, the Air Ministry is also carefully studying the dispatch of aircraft to fly over Polish airspace, as the aircraft must avoid flying over Germany, Switzerland, or Denmark due to diplomatic relations. According to well-informed sources, the Air Ministry may send aircraft to Egypt first, and then detour to Turkey, Romania, and Poland, and land once in each of these countries so that British pilots can make contact with the air force pilots of those countries. This matter requires more complicated preparations, but it can establish contact between British and Allied military personnel, which is crucial for military cooperation. (Havas News Agency, 18th)

Warsaw - General Ironside, leader of the British military mission, held a two-hour meeting today with Polish Army Commander-in-Chief Rydz-Śmigły and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. Ironside then had lunch with Polish President Mościcki. The Polish Daily commented on the British military mission's decision to come to Poland, saying that Ironside had inspected British and French troops in Paris before coming to Poland. These two events, one after another, can slightly indicate the military alliance and cooperation between Britain, France, and Poland. There is no doubt that Eyre's mission will make a great contribution to the security of the three countries. (Reuters, 19th)

### Goering to Inspect Western Border Defenses

### No New Progress in British-French-Soviet Negotiations

(London) Regarding the negotiations currently underway between the British, French, and Soviet authorities, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, submitted a detailed report to the government after holding talks with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov yesterday.

According to well-informed sources, there has been no change in the negotiation situation. Molotov will meet with the British and French ambassadors again within days to deliver the Soviet government's reply. Generally speaking, it is still possible to reach an agreement until the last moment. (Havas News Agency, 18th)

### The Soviet Union Eager to Restore Friendship with Romania; New Ambassadorial Candidate Determined

Romanian Capital - According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union will send an ambassador to Romania again, but who the new ambassador will be has not yet been announced. Since the Soviet ambassador to Romania left office in January 1938, the Soviet Union has never sent an ambassador to Romania. If this news can be confirmed, it can prove that the Soviet Union is again trying to establish friendly relations with Romania. (Associated Press, 19th)

### British Parliament to Adjourn at the Beginning of Next Month; Cabinet Considers Amending Constitution; Can Be Convened at Any Time in Case of Emergency

(London) The Cabinet will submit the "Summer Vacation Plan" for discussion at the weekly meeting tomorrow, so that the government and Parliament can respond calmly in the event of an emergency during the summer vacation. It is reported that Parliament will adjourn on August 4 and reconvene in mid-September (after the German Nazi Party holds a conference in Nuremberg) until the beginning of October. If no war breaks out by then, a general election will be held for the House of Commons within the year. What the government authorities are concerned about now is that the international situation may experience a crisis during the summer vacation, or while the dissolution and re-election of the House of Commons is not yet completed. Regarding the former, it is only necessary to notify all cabinet members not to leave the capital and to ask the leaders of all political parties to maintain contact with the government authorities, so that Parliament can reconvene quickly even in the event of an emergency. Regarding the latter, according to constitutional provisions, the House of Commons ceases to exist after its dissolution and can only convene an extraordinary meeting in the event of a major event involving the King. For this reason, the government authorities will propose a bill so that the House of Commons can be convened at any time in the event of an emergency after its dissolution. (Havas News Agency, 18th)

### Six Million Soviet Youths Ready to Defend the Country at Any Time; Sports Review Parade Held in Red Square; Athletes from All Republics Participate to Show Spirit of Unity

(Moscow) Today, the Soviet Union celebrated the All-Union Sports Festival with an unprecedentedly grand sports review parade held in Red Square. Participants included 40,000 male and female athletes from all eleven trade unions, collective farms, and Red Army, Navy, and Air Force branches of the country, all of whom were elites in the domestic sports world. Soviet sports have always been known to be developed, and 6 million people have passed the sports test and been awarded the "Labor Defense Pass Badge."

At the opening of this conference, the grandstand along the Kremlin wall was filled with guests, including workers, collective farmers, intellectuals, Red Army representatives, and members of the diplomatic corps. At noon, Stalin arrived and ascended the Lenin Mausoleum. All the athletes and spectators gave warm cheers in various ethnic languages. In addition to Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, Andreev, Zhdanov, Mikoyan, Shvernik, Beria, Malenkov, Shcherbakov, and other senior officials of the government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were also present. Before the review, a conference was held. Mikhailov, secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered a speech, welcoming all athletes, saying, "Soviet youth are ready to rise up to defend the country at any time, so that those who have failed to understand the lessons of the Changkufeng Incident will have another chance to try," etc. After that, the review ceremony began in front of the party and government leaders. The first to pass the parade were a large group of children holding flowers and singing, followed by the athletes of the Russian Republic, led by the best sports teams awarded the Sports Badge, followed by the columns of Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and national sports associations, holding high the flags of each republic and association. The neat and solemn lineup impressed the entire audience. After the parade, the athletes of each republic held sports performances separately. The Ukrainian athletes performed the historical events of 1918 when the people of the republic and the Russians jointly drove out the German occupation forces. Afterwards, the republics also performed successively, and their festivals reflected the development of the culture of each nation in the country and their unity and friendship. (TASS News Agency, 18th)

(Moscow) Snegov, chairman of the Sports and Sports Committee directly under the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, published an article describing the current state of Soviet sports, saying, "Soviet sports figures are celebrating the festival today with practical achievements.

The various sports buildings in Moscow, Kyiv, Sverdlovsk, Leningrad, Odessa, and other cities are as well-equipped as the best in Europe and the United States." (TASS News Agency, 18th)

### United States Assists South American Countries in Building Navies; Senate Submits for Discussion

(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a closed-door meeting yesterday and decided to submit a bill to the Senate authorizing the President to allow Latin American countries to build warships in American shipyards.

### Long Yun Raises 50 Million to Expand and Build the Simao-Pu'er Railway; Provincial Highway Construction Method Determined; All Roads to Be Completed and Open to Traffic by Next Year

Kunming Special Airmail News: Gejiu is the world's most productive tin-producing area, with more than 100,000 miners relying on it for a living. The annual tin output is 7,000-8,000 tons. For the convenience of transportation, the Gejiu-Bisezhai Railway was built and has been operating for more than ten years. Later, the Mengzi-Jijie to Lin'an-Shiping Railway was added, which has been operating for several years and is very convenient.

Expanding and Building Railways: However, due to the rugged mountain roads, narrow tracks, and many caves, the central section from Huogudu to Zhadian is extremely dangerous, with mountains on one side and cliffs on the other. The scale of its construction is considered the first in the provinces of Yunnan, and its transportation volume and business are also among the top in China's railways in terms of revenue. Unfortunately, too many people are employed and management is poor, and old debts have not yet been paid off. Now, Chairman Long deeply believes that Gejiu is a tin-producing area and Simao-Pu'er is an international route, and that there is a need to build roads in both areas. At the provincial affairs meeting yesterday, he proposed establishing an enterprise company to raise 50 million in capital to build the Pu'er-Simao Railway, planning to connect from Shiping on the Gejiu-Bisezhai Railway, passing through Yuanjiang to Pu'er and Simao. The speed will be three stations from Shiping to Yuanjiang, three stations from Yuanjiang to Mojiang, five stations from Mojiang to Pu'er, and two stations from Pu'er to Simao. In the future, if Simao is connected to Myanmar or Vietnam, it will become an international railway. Currently, Finance Director Lu Zian has personally gone to Gejiu to discuss this matter, and it is expected that there will be progress in the next few days.

### Japanese Blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin Only Provokes Resentment from Various Countries

It is generally believed that the Japanese army has made another big mistake. Britain is preparing to strengthen its defenses in the area.

The "China Press" London correspondence on June 18th stated that a prominent British resident of Tianjin, who returned to his home country on leave several months ago, told reporters that the time when Britain will have to greatly strengthen its Tianjin defenses is approaching. This is because the Japanese army, beginning to realize the hopelessness of its adventurist actions in China, will engage in extremely aberrant behavior in the area. It is superfluous to revisit the Tianjin incident three weeks after it occurred. However, a few points are worth noting. The Japanese government's response to the protest from the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, stating that the Tianjin dispute is a local incident that must be resolved locally, is of great significance. The Japanese government clearly admits that it has very little control over the Japanese army in China, especially the Kwantung Army, which is most evident. The reporter heard today from two well-informed correspondents of the latest news from North and Central China, that the Japanese soldiers in China are penniless, and their officers are almost the same. The reporter also noted for the first time today that the telegram hinted at the Japanese demand to store 50 million yuan worth of silver belonging to the Chinese government in the British Concession of Tianjin. The uncontrollable nature of the Japanese "young officers" class, and the fact that if Japan is drawn into another war, the "young officers" will disregard the reality of Japan's situation, and their tendency to run rampant are factors that cannot be ignored. Economic retaliation against Japan may be a response to Japan's overall erosion of British interests in China, rather than just to the blockade of Tianjin. Some people oppose this idea, but it is difficult to understand why. However, there is no doubt that the British government is seriously considering economic retaliation. Yesterday, the Tokyo dispatch of the Domei News Agency inadvertently revealed that the Japanese were extremely alarmed by Britain's consideration of economic retaliation. The British Department of Commerce is averse to anything outside of routine matters from 10 am to 4 pm, but now it is doing everything it can to insist on dissent. Certain merchants who are profiting greatly from the current situation in China are also doing the same. This is a disgusting fact, but it seems undeniable. Another common opinion is that the blockade of Tianjin is a confession of weakness by the Japanese army, and another big mistake. This move must have greatly surprised Japanese diplomats, because Tianjin has no trade to speak of, and the blockade has not made things worse than before, and the women and children in the concession have already left. Our (British) approach to the Tianjin case is to hold our ground and take no action, but the Japanese actions make the world's resentment towards Japan grow day by day, especially in the United States. This matter has aroused a feeling of annoyance and represents any issue related to this war. Only God can predict the outcome, but if Japan expects Britain to "act in good faith and cooperation," in other words, to help them subjugate the Chinese who cannot be conquered by illegal means, then it is making a very big mistake.

### The Gold Standard is Most Beloved: Everyone is Rushing to Exchange Banknotes for Gold, Closing at a High Price of $3,200. If Calculated According to the Exchange Rate, it is Still $400 Lower.

Yesterday's spot gold market was fiery. Although the tight exchange situation had gradually eased, the gold market continued to soar wildly. It opened at 95 yuan above the previous price, and by the evening, it had reached an unprecedented peak of 3,200 yuan. Although there were fluctuations along the way, the overall trend was upward. This was because local merchants and outsiders had aggressively purchased gold the previous day and were holding onto it tightly. Today, they further increased their purchases, making the available gold even scarcer. As a result, the price rose sharply by another 145 yuan. However, due to the high exchange premium and the difficulty in obtaining banknotes, those who wanted to buy were finding it difficult to operate as they wished. Otherwise, the rise in price would have been even more difficult to contain. Therefore, according to the current exchange rate, the gold price should be between 3,550 and 3,600 yuan. Today's gold price is still about 400 yuan lower. Trading was brisk, with approximately 2,000 taels traded throughout the day. Jewelry gold also rose sharply by 15 yuan, reaching an unprecedented record of 325 yuan. Customs gold remained stable, while the prices of British and Chinese pure gold decreased slightly.

Spot Gold Becomes Scarcer and Rises Again by 115 Yuan

From the morning, the price per tael (ten taels) initially rose because of news that HSBC would only maintain the listed exchange rate. This made people more cautious, and sellers were mostly hesitant. However, buyers were offering 3,100 yuan. A certain gold firm, eager to increase its purchases for speculators, raised the price by 50 yuan. Only then did silversmiths sell 50 taels at a price of 3,100 yuan, a jump of 95 yuan compared to the previous day. Soon after, 50 taels were bought from money changers at a price of 150 yuan. Later, a money changer, acting on behalf of a client, sold 50 taels for profit, lowering the price slightly by a dozen yuan. A money changer sold 50 taels to another money changer for 138 yuan, which was the low price of the day. At that time, British gold was approaching the 5 pence mark, and the exchange rate had broken through the 10 yuan barrier, causing buying to revive. A certain bank and money changers made aggressive purchases. Although silversmiths and spot gold firms were selling, the supply still could not meet the demand, causing the price to gradually rise. A certain gold firm, acting on behalf of speculators, also began buying, making the increase even more severe. Money changers bought 50 taels from silversmiths at a price as high as 175 yuan. Thereafter, buyers heard that the exchange rate had stabilized and that the exchange premium had soared to over 160 yuan, so their buying interest waned slightly. Money changers and retail investors rushed to sell, causing the price to fall by over 20 yuan. Gold firms sold 50 taels to money changers at a price of 150 yuan. At noon, the situation became tense again. Money changers bought 50 taels from gold firms at 160 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, a certain gold firm and a certain silversmith, etc., were keen on buying, causing the market to be dominated by buying. The price rose again by 30 yuan. Silversmiths sold 50 taels to gold firms at a price of 190 yuan. Subsequently, money changers, acting on behalf of speculators, sold 150 taels to a certain gold firm, bringing the price down to 178 yuan at one point. But almost immediately, a certain silversmith's buying interest revived, and the price jumped by over 10 yuan in an instant. A certain silversmith bought 50 taels from gold firms at a price of 191 yuan. Late into the evening, a certain money changer bought 50 taels from gold firms at a price of 3,200 yuan, reaching an unprecedented new high. As a result, the price had increased by 145 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been rising for two consecutive days, for a total increase of 581 yuan. The spot gold price at spot gold firms was about 10 yuan higher than the current price, and buying required a reduction of 15 yuan. The current bid price for gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price. According to inquiries, there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Follows the Rise by 15 Yuan: The Difference Between Buying and Selling Prices Widens

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael initially did not change. But around 10 o'clock, because the spot gold price opened higher by over 90 yuan, it also rose sharply by 10 yuan. Later, at 31 minutes past the hour, it was raised by another 5 yuan, for a total increase of 15 yuan. Da Tong Hang changed its listed price to 325 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang's price was 323 yuan, an unprecedented record since the market began. However, because the spot gold price has been fluctuating greatly recently, and because the purchase of old gold items must be melted down after seven days, silversmiths uniformly reduced the buying price by a dozen to twenty yuan from the selling price.

British Pound is Strong, Pure Gold Returns a Small Halfpenny per Ounce

London, 18th: Due to the strong British pound, the price of British pure gold fell by half a penny per ounce, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, five and a half pence. This caused the Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash to also decrease to one thousand two hundred yuan and nine jiao. The listed price of Customs gold remained stable at two yuan, three jiao, nine fen, six li. The price of Shanghai standard gold also fell by four jiao, reaching one thousand two hundred and seven yuan and two jiao.

### Foreign Firms are Still Making Deals: Exchange Rate Continues to Tighten, US Exchange Rate Enters the 10 Yuan Territory

Yesterday's exchange market: HSBC's listed rates were announced. The British exchange rate was stable, while the US exchange rate tightened by 0.025, reaching an unprecedented record of 9.6875. Except for the Indian and Hong Kong exchange rates, which remained unchanged, new low prices were discovered. The unofficial British and American exchange market started chaotic but ended stable, with the situation turning stable. The initial opening remained unchanged from the previous night's closing price. Because HSBC only allowed the maintenance of the listed price (British gold at 5 pence, US exchange rate at 9.75), the situation was actually a market with quotations but no transactions. Around 9:30, business began. Because oil firms such as Mobil and Asiatic Petroleum, and British American Tobacco, etc., suddenly wanted to absorb at the listed price, HSBC sold a considerable amount, and the market stabilized. Although the absorbing did not stop, a Hong Kong cable suddenly offered to sell, and other foreign firms also showed a slightly stronger intention to sell, so the situation became more stable. The noon closing remained unchanged, but the result continued to soften. The US exchange rate broke into the 10 yuan territory. As for the seven- and eight-month futures, sellers, seeing the current market situation, dared not easily sell off, so the further out the contract, the tighter it became. Therefore, the swap spread widened. The spot and August British gold differed by half a penny, and the US dollar differed by one yuan. Currently, the seven- and eight-month swap interest rate (excluding commissions) has reached a thick 8.23 percent per month. However, operators are still constrained by the lack of cash, so few transactions were heard. As for spot trading, it was very sparse because Western merchants such as Sassoon and a certain Fang were mostly watching. The bank's selling price for the Hong Kong exchange rate also tightened to 35 yuan.

HSBC's Listed British Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged

In the early morning, the London cable was stable for both near and far terms. The New York silver price remained stable. London gold fell by half a penny. The exchange rate for British to US dollars rose by 2.2 percent, while it fell sharply by 9.375 against Shanghai, and remained unchanged against France. The US dollar rose by 1.25 against the British pound, fell sharply by 2.54 yuan against Shanghai, and rose by 0.0625 against France. The Central Bank's listed rates for various exchanges remained as before. In the morning, the bank's spot selling prices were 5.25 pence for British gold and 10.025 yuan for the US dollar, with no gains or losses compared to the previous day. After the opening, because the major foreign firms had a large number of settlements, and because the British bank, HSBC, was only willing to supply at the previous day's listed price (5 pence for British gold and 9.75 yuan for the US dollar), the supply could not keep up, and the market immediately became tight. British gold immediately softened to 5.0625 pence, and the US dollar also tightened to 9.875 yuan. However, foreign firms still found it difficult to settle at the higher prices. When HSBC's listed rates were announced, the British exchange rate was unchanged, while the US dollar was tightened again by 0.0625. Except for the Indian and Hong Kong exchange rates, the other exchanges also tightened slightly. The White Silver Equalization Tax was announced and remained exempt. After that, British American Tobacco and other foreign firms successively bought HSBC and Chartered Bank spot gold at 5.0 pence. Then, Mobil also settled with HSBC for spot US dollars at 9.75 and 8.125 yuan. At this time, a Hong Kong cable suddenly offered to sell, and other firms also showed a slightly stronger intention to sell, so the situation turned stable. Hong Kong Cable and foreign firms such as Hua Bi Holland successively sold Asiatic Petroleum and other firms spot British gold at 5.0625 and 0.03125. It was noon at this time. The bank's selling price for the Hong Kong exchange rate also softened to 35 yuan, but few transactions were heard. By the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 5.03125 pence for British gold and 9.8125 yuan for the US dollar. The current month's British gold was 9.0625 pence, and the US dollar was 9.5625 yuan. August's British gold was 4.53125 pence, and the US dollar was 8.8125 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous night's closing, the spot British pound tightened by 1.11875, and the US dollar also softened by 4.375. The current month's British pound tightened by 1.2875, and the US dollar also softened by 4.375. August's British pound tightened by approximately 3.125, and the US dollar softened by approximately 6.875. Hong Kong: as sold by the bank, also tightened by 2 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The trading record for the half-day is recorded below:

Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market continued to be firm. After the exchange rate shrank sharply, winds and rain intensified, and everyone was . Retail sales by local merchants and customers in the street gradually became active. However, wholesale purchases were affected by the exchange rate and the discount rate for banknotes, so they were not easy to develop for a while. Yesterday, factory prices insisted on 4.65 yuan, and local merchants all required cash. The market situation changed from weak to firm. At the same time, the goods held by firms and customers in the hands of those who bought earlier also gradually tightened, with prices 5 to 6 fen higher than before, generally requiring a selling price of over 5 yuan (exchange rate). Foreign flour had a combined high production price, with a price of 5.1 yuan (exchange rate), but the buying power of buyers was still weak, which could be called a market with quotations but no transactions. Today, 2,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Tianjin, and another 2,000 bags are being shipped to Xiamen.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market trend also turned upward. Due to hurricane and rain, not many goods arrived. The sellers insisted on higher prices due to the sharp changes in the exchange rate and the increase in prices, and the selling intentions were uniformly firm. However, Japanese factories did not have any plans, only waiting for the favor of local merchants and hoarders. Approximately 1,300 bags of wheat were opened, including Suzhou, Kunshan, Danyang, and Daqiao wheat, with the highest prices being 6.73 yuan and 6.8 fen, and 5.8 fen, which was about 1 jiao higher than before.

### Sales are Active: Rice Prices Rise Again

Since the turning point in financial and other issues the other day, the rice market continued to rise yesterday. Sales in the local street were active, and if hoarders were to transfer goods to each other, the trading would be unusually lively. At the same time, customer traders, wholesalers, and special goods did not show samples, and the goods in the central market took the opportunity to launch, and the asking price gradually increased. Common Jing rice in Changzhou and Wuxi was opened at a limit of 20 yuan, and high-quality tip rice was also opened at 16 yuan according to the limit. Changbang old Jing rice was also opened at 19.56 yuan, and high-quality thin rice was opened at 20 yuan.

Although there were new foreign rice arrivals, the market was still lively. High-quality goods rose sharply by three to four jiao, while low-priced coarse rice and mid-grade machine Xian rice rose by five to six jiao. The number of transactions throughout the day also increased to over 5,000.

Foreign Rice: The new Saigon rice arrived yesterday and was sampled in the market. However, as the local customer Xian rice was soaring, the owners were trying to maintain good prices and were unwilling to sell cheaply with the market. Therefore, many were not agreed upon. Only over 200 bags of Saigon rice were opened in the overall market, with prices of 22.3 yuan and 22.5 yuan, including feed.

### Securities: Amidst the Four Sides of Chu's Songs, How Can Government Bonds Be Spared from the Falling Wind? Unified B Falls Miserably by Nine Jiao; Foreign Stocks' Buying Interest Almost Disappears

Yesterday's securities market suddenly started falling due to the strangely tight money supply. The Tianjin incident and the Sino-Japanese conference were feared to have no results, and everyone was even more uneasy about the legal currency issue. Foreign exchange and gold continued to rise tightly. The drip of water that is not stopped becomes a flood. The escape of Tianjin banknotes to Shanghai and cash became even more intense. Government bonds were in the four sides of Chu's songs. One wave was not over, and another wave rose. The multiple parties felt even more worried. Therefore, the money supply was strangely tight. A certain household was forced to leave the multi-headed position for some reason, and the market price suddenly tended to fall. If the issue of principal and interest and the rumored news of paying in exchange rates could be maintained, it is hoped that the authorities will formally announce the Sino-Japanese situation. Yesterday, at the initial opening, Yongfeng bought in, and Liaobin and Hengfu sold slightly. The market price was small in February and March, which was fairly stable. Subsequently, there was a large amount of sales on the 16th, especially in type B. Yuanda sold out and weakened, and the market price fell. Although Bensin and Xieda still had demand, Datong, Shuntai, and Renchang still sold, so the result fell sharply by more than one yuan to two yuan compared to the previous day. The total number of transactions was approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Concentrates, Yarn Prices Rise Frequently; Double Horse Creates a New High Price, Reaching 521 Yuan

The yarn market continued to rise, and the momentum remained strong. Speculators were particularly keen on buying. At the same time, in South China, Hong Kong merchants were purchasing a large amount of 20-count and 21-count yarn such as Double Horse, and 23-count yarn such as Golden Rooster, Five Blessings, and Shepherd, and the appetite remained healthy, totaling 470 bales. Yunnan imported 125 bales of 10-count coarse yarn. In this enthusiastic atmosphere, rumors were rife in the market, all favorable to the multiple parties, and the buying wind was still strong. The market continued to advance towards a higher peak. The upward strength of 20-count Double Horse was getting stronger and stronger. General operators were using it as a tool, so the range of fluctuations expanded. The highest reached 521 yuan. The highest price for Double Horse on June 19 was 510 yuan, so it has now risen by more than 10 yuan. As for unpopular yarn, transactions were lacking, and the selling price remained unchanged.

The current yarn market situation: The market trended upward at the start of the morning. It was generally said that exchange drafts were still likely to shrink, and there were many buyers. Asking prices rose by three to four hundred yuan. The list price of 20-count Double Horse stack was 502 yuan, and it immediately rose by three yuan, reaching 505 yuan. The spot price was 510 yuan. Shortly after, gold merchants and securities merchants came to buy yarn, and the price immediately jumped, with calling prices rising one after another. The highest spot price for 20-count Double Horse foreign stack was 521 yuan, and the stack list price was 510 yuan. Some holders sold out to take profits, and it fell back down by three yuan. By the closing, it had recovered slightly by one or two yuan. According to statistics, 1,440 bales were traded in half a day. Among the yarn types, 20-count Double Horse rose by 12 yuan alone, Shepherd rose by 3.5 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by 10 yuan.

Japanese Yarn Market: Seeing progress is actually for spot sales. In addition, exchange premiums are strangely high, and there is no way out, so the selling price of spot yarn is flat. The current offering price for 20-count Yueqin is 412 yuan, but the price for the next month is smart and all contains speculative characteristics.

### Chinese and Foreign Cotton Transactions Move Slightly, Market Rises by Six, Seven, and Eight Yuan; US Cotton Export Subsidies Have Not Yet Been Resolved

Transactions in the Chinese and foreign cotton market have begun to develop. The factory made an advance purchase of 500 bales of Changyin sand cotton from the Xinyu factory at a price of 100 yuan delivered to the factory, which is 4 to 5 yuan higher than before the exchange rate changed. However, later batches of the same industry also transacted 150 bales, plus 2 yuan. As for foreign cotton companies, they have also begun to buy and sell each other, transacting 400 pieces. It is also reported that foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have become even quieter since the exchange rate plummeted the other day and the spot yarn premium has risen again. Factory parties are finding it more difficult to allocate funds, and some of the foreign cotton previously ordered that have not yet been shipped are planning to settle prices with foreign firms. Although the Indian cotton market has been falling continuously in recent days, the gains in exchange rates offset any profits by about six yuan per dan. There have been several settlements yesterday. Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was weak from the beginning. A cable from Liverpool reported a decline, causing the multiple heads to settle. The industry is also turning to a wait-and-see attitude towards the cotton market because the issue of US cotton export subsidies has not been resolved. Subsequently, cotton prices fell due to improved weather in the cotton-growing regions and selling short in the south. As a result, the closing price was eight to ten pounds lower than the previous day. The Indian cotton market was flat, with overall predictions slightly rising by half a rupee. Egypt rose by eight pounds.

### Textile Trade: Exchange Rate Fluctuations Increase Cloth Prices

The cloth market in the nation is in a tense state as foreign exchange shrinks again. However, the current cash discount rate has also soared to unprecedented highs. Although fellow traders have high hopes, they are constrained by a lack of spot cash and tight funds. Therefore, the prices of all goods sold for cash have held steady at their original levels. Prices for goods settled through exchange transfers are based on the price at the money exchange, which is a significant increase of seven to eight yuan compared to the previous day. This indicates that public confidence remains stable, but the excessively high prices may hinder sales for manufacturers. 273 bales of Tonghua cloth from northern Jiangsu have arrived again. Today, 95 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is listed below.

Changyin Sand: 102.00, 150 bales purchased by fellow traders through exchange transfer at the money exchange.

White Cloth: 97.00, 200 bales purchased by fellow traders through cash at the money exchange.

Ordinary New Special: 81.00, 200 bales purchased by fellow traders through cash at the money exchange.

American Packing: 101.50, 100 bales purchased by fellow traders through exchange transfer at the money exchange.

Changyin Sand: 100.00, 500 bales purchased by the Xinyu Factory through exchange transfer for factory use.

The sales prices of all cloths have risen uniformly. Colored cloth and colored twill have increased by 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt, fine cloth and fine twill have increased by 1 to 2.5 jiao per bolt, and coarse cloth and coarse twill have increased by 0.5 to 2.5 jiao per bolt. However, due to the high discount rate, goods priced in exchange transfers are still cheaper than those priced in cash. Therefore, yesterday, fellow traders and hoarders chose to settle 70% through exchange transfers and 30% in cash, leading to tighter procurement of various goods. Over 200 bales of fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth were traded. Guangdong and Yunnan brokers purchased 100 bales of fine twill and fine cloth. Over 100 bales of dyed fine twill were purchased in this street. Conversely, transactions for goods priced in cash have slowed down. Many hoarders are converting their existing cash into exchange transfers to hoard goods. Due to the sudden rise in sales prices, there have been few transactions in the colored cloth market. Retail sales in this street have been sluggish due to the impact of wind and rain.

In the eastern cloth market, the customer interest in white fine cloth and fine twill waned yesterday due to the surge in cash discounts, leading to a decline in sales prices. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth once fell below the 14 yuan mark, closing at 14.1 yuan at noon. The price for the current month is 14.2 yuan. It is rumored that Japanese firms are also facing tight credit and are continuously selling Qingdao fine cloth at low prices to raise cash. Yesterday, "Magpie Brand" fine cloth was priced at 13.6 yuan and "Flower Island" fine cloth at 13.4 yuan. Local traders were hesitant to purchase. Brokers from Qinhuangdao continue to procure 200 bales of "Dragon Head" fine cloth. According to traders, if the discount can be reduced slightly, the cloth market's upward trend will remain strong.

Exports: Today, 22 bolts of cloth were shipped to Qingdao, 25 bolts to Yantai, 70 bolts to Tianjin, 25 bolts to Xiamen, 120 bolts to Hong Kong, 35 bolts to Guangzhou Bay, 15 bolts to Beihai, and 560 bolts to Haiphong.

### Silk and Tea: Sudden Exchange Rate Fluctuations Cause Silk Prices to Rise; Signs of Disorder

The silk market continued to rise yesterday. White Factory B was selling at 2560 yuan, and some were even selling at 2680 yuan. However, the former price seems more reliable, while the latter may be for higher-grade white silk. The disordered pricing of silk is evident here. Filature silk is also rising sharply. Yesterday, six grades of Qilin Running Horse were selling at 1460 yuan, an increase of 250 yuan in two days. However, there were few transactions, as the raw silk inventory is depleted and the future of raw materials is uncertain. Furthermore, the future development of the legal tender is a topic of much debate. Therefore, most prudent merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach. International silk prices are also rising. In the American market, New York spot raw silk rose by 5 cents, Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk rose by 3 cents, recent standard silk rose by 3 cents, and forward silk rose by 4 cents. Yokohama spot prices fell by 15 yuan in the morning and rose by 1 yuan at closing. This rise in silk prices is due to the sudden contraction of exchange reserves, so there is little impact abroad. Active sales are beyond doubt.

### Green Tea Transactions Sluggish

Yesterday, transactions for foreign firms' green tea were quite sluggish. Most tea factories are hesitant to purchase due to high costs, resulting in low inventories. High-quality goods are largely unavailable. Only Xiehe, Jinlong, and other firms purchased 270 boxes of medium-to-low grade Zhen Mei tea. Select Zhen Mei was selling for 305 to 320 yuan, ordinary Zhen Mei for 250 to 265 yuan, and Xi Zhen Mei for 545 yuan, with prices remaining stable.

### New Hurricane Lands at Hangzhou Bay and Advances Rapidly; Hits Shanghai This Morning; Storm Surge Turns Low-Lying Areas into Waterlands; Shipping in Shanghai and Other Areas Suspended; High Tide Combined with Hurricane Could Cause Severe Flooding

A new hurricane that formed in Luzon Island in the Pacific Ocean was initially moving due north, so it was not taken seriously. However, from 2 PM the day before yesterday, the Xujiahui Observatory reported that the hurricane's direction had shifted from due north to a north-northwest trend, and its speed was very fast, traveling 120 nautical miles in the eight hours from 6 AM to 2 PM that day. This began to draw attention. At 6 AM yesterday, the Xujiahui Observatory reported that the hurricane had reached 26 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude, with the center of the storm within a 60-nautical-mile radius. The direction suddenly shifted to a rapid northwest advance. According to the reported position, it was west of Naha Island in the Ryukyu Islands, only 300 nautical miles from Shanghai, heading directly for the city.

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" stated that Shanghai is predicted to experience stronger winds, rain, and hurricane-force conditions tonight (the 19th) and tomorrow (the 20th), as the hurricane is rapidly approaching Shanghai. From 6 AM yesterday (the 18th) to 6 AM this morning, the hurricane advanced at a rate of 18 nautical miles. If it maintains this speed, it is expected to reach Hangzhou Bay off the coast of Zhejiang tonight. It is reported that the hurricane's center reached 26 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude within 60 miles at 6 AM this morning, with the wind direction being northwest.

Hanging Ball Warning

After receiving the report from Xujiahui Observatory, the Jianghai Customs immediately hung a black ball on the Bund New Customs Wharf and the Customs Wharf on Weituoma Road at 2 PM to warn of the hurricane approaching Shanghai and to prohibit any ships from entering or leaving the Huangpu River. Civilian ships and sailboats were all ordered to sail to the Lujiazui area of Pudong to seek shelter from the wind.

Approaching Shanghai

The observatory reported at 2 PM yesterday that the hurricane had reached 27 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, with the center within a 60-nautical-mile radius. The direction remained northwest, and the wind was very strong. At that time, the hurricane was only 280 nautical miles from Shanghai and was continuing to advance rapidly towards the city.

Adding Black Balls

By 4 PM yesterday, the observatory reported that the hurricane had reached 27 degrees 30 minutes north latitude and 123 degrees 43 minutes east longitude, with the center still within a 60-nautical-mile radius, moving in a northwest or north-northwest direction. According to the reported position, the hurricane was only 160 nautical miles from Shanghai, making it inevitable that the city would be hit. The Jianghai Customs added another black ball (two in total) to the roof and the wharf on Xian Tuoma Road to warn that the hurricane was about to hit Shanghai.

Force Eight Winds

The hurricane hitting Shanghai had a wind force of about seven to eight yesterday afternoon. Shanghai has experienced swirling winds and showers since early yesterday morning, indicating initial disturbances from the hurricane. The wind became stronger and the showers heavier in the afternoon, with few pedestrians on the roads and sluggish business in stores. However, traffic was not significantly affected as of 8 PM last night. The Huangpu River was very quiet, and all kinds of ships had ceased operations.

Hits Shanghai This Morning

If the hurricane continues to advance rapidly in a north-west or north-northwest direction, it will hit Shanghai between midnight last night and early this morning. Furthermore, there will be a high tide in the Huangpu River between 2 AM and 3 AM today. If this coincides with the hurricane, the water level will rise sharply, and the tide may overflow the banks along the Bund, while low-lying roads will inevitably be flooded.

Shipping Suspended

The American President Lines' President Coolidge, which came to Shanghai from the United States, was delayed due to the hurricane and arrived at 2:30 PM yesterday, berthing at buoys 11 and 12. Passengers disembarked in sequence. The ship was originally scheduled to depart at 10 AM this morning for Hong Kong and Luzon. Yesterday, the company stated that to avoid danger due to the hurricane, the ship would depart at 5 PM today if the wind subsided slightly. The small ferry for passengers was scheduled to depart from the New Customs Wharf at 3:30 PM. The Far Eastern Company's Hana, which was originally scheduled to sail the Shanghai-Ningbo route, returned to Shanghai at about 3 PM yesterday and is scheduled to depart for Ningbo tomorrow (the 21st), so it is not affected by the hurricane. The Hainan Company's Yangtze River, which left Shanghai for Dinghai, Wan Dai Shan, and Sanmen Bay yesterday afternoon, was forced to anchor at buoy 31 to avoid the hurricane due to its small size. The ship had more than 80 passengers on board, and the company sent a small ferry to buoy 31 to allow passengers who did not wish to wait on board to return to Shanghai. It is reported that the Yangtze River did not have adequate food supplies for the passengers, so they will likely disembark to wait for the hurricane to pass before re-boarding the ship. The Great Britain Company's Sudan mail ship was detained by the Japanese army at Dagu Kou for half a month. Yesterday, the company said that the issue had been resolved and the ship had left Tianjin for Shanghai, expected to arrive at 6 PM today, berthing at buoys 13 and 14 to load passengers and cargo, and scheduled to depart for Europe on the 21st (Friday) at 3 PM. However, as the hurricane also affected the sea, it is uncertain whether the ship will arrive on time. Ships sailing the lower reaches of the Yangtze River usually return to Shanghai after 3 or 4 PM, but none arrived yesterday, and there will be no ships departing today. There were no ships arriving from the north or south yesterday. Today, the Shandong will arrive from Qingdao and the Zesheng will arrive from Hong Kong. The departing ships include the Guisheng for Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Fuzhou, and Tianjin, the Jinan for Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Haiphong, and the Fusheng for Hong Kong. Whether they can depart as scheduled depends on the wind conditions today. It is still uncertain whether the Blue Funnel Line's Antena (transliteration) will arrive from Liverpool, England today. Last night, two red lights were still hanging high on the roof of the Customs clock tower.

Another Waterland

From yesterday afternoon, storm winds and rain hit the city again. For a time, the wind was terrifying and the rain poured down, not stopping all night. At the same time, the high tide in the Huangpu River rose again, turning low-lying roads in the Public Settlement and the French Concession into waterlands. Roads such as Guangxi Road, Fuzhou Road, Zhejiang Road, Difeng Road, Jishi Ferry Road, Xiafei Road, Saporro Road, Ximen Road, and Malang Road were all flooded. At 5:45 PM, a section of power line on the French Damalu Xixin Bridge was suddenly blown down and broken, but fortunately no one was injured. It was quickly repaired.

Hurricane and High Tide Coincidence Concerning

According to the research of Dr. Chaddleigh (British), the former chief engineer of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, although the summer and autumn seasons are the times when hurricanes are most likely to hit Shanghai, the chance of coinciding with the time of high tide in the Huangpu River is not very high, only one in ten opportunities on average. Therefore, knowing the above situation, it is known that Shanghai's considerable flooding caused by hurricanes is not common, only occurring once every few years.

Huangpu River Water Flow Smooth

This year's Huangpu River water conservancy situation is far from comparable to the situation before the war. The dredging work of the Huangpu River has completely stopped. The smooth flow of the Huangpu River is due to the dredging bureau's year-round hard work in dredging, so the rising and falling tides can quickly advance and retreat with the tide.

Disadvantages After Loss of Dredging

It has been two years since the Huangpu River was dredged. Water flow is stagnant, which is inevitable. In the event of a hurricane, the water level of the Huangpu River will inevitably be raised by the wind force, and the amount of water accumulated on the ground due to heavy rain will not be able to be quickly absorbed and discharged by the drains, even if it is quickly absorbed and discharged with the receding tide, it will be slow. These are all inevitable situations and worth noting.

### Ministry of Finance Replies to Chamber of Commerce Again: Copper Auxiliary Coin Notes Being Rushed to Print; Two Denominations: One Fen and Five Fen

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to quickly arrange relief measures for the severe shortage of copper coins in the city. Although various sectors are using stamps and revenue stamps as substitutes, it is ultimately inconvenient. The Chamber also received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance in response, stating that it was rushing to print auxiliary coin notes. The Chamber received another telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Your telegram received. The Ministry has approved the urgent shortage of copper auxiliary coins in Shanghai and has ordered the Central Bank to urgently print and issue one-fen and five-fen auxiliary coin notes to provide relief. Please be informed."

### North China Banknotes Being Exchanged as Much as Possible; Foreign Exchange Stabilizes Yesterday; Rumors Subside and Market Confidence Eases; However, Gold Rises and Discount Fever Intensifies

Reuters London, 19th: The "Financial News" published an article commenting on the renewed sharp decline in the value of Chinese legal tender, stating that the fact that the legal tender was allowed to depreciate again after a short period shows that although the Sino-British equalization fund has not been completely exhausted, there is little left. It is now up to the United Kingdom to decide whether to continue to assist China's foreign exchange. Sino-British financiers here are very puzzled by the overall decline in legal tender. However, it is generally agreed that the legal tender must be allowed to find its own level. The extent to which this level will reach is now a matter of conjecture, and will largely depend on the political and economic trends of the Chinese war.

Reuters London, 19th: According to Reuters, the issue of the United Kingdom continuing to support China's stabilization fund for legal tender has not yet arisen. However, the general opinion in London is that this support will be provided if necessary. Although some observers acknowledge that Chinese legal tender is affected by the trade deficit, they believe that there is another major influence, namely the success of the Japanese in exchanging large quantities of Federal Reserve banknotes for Chinese legal tender.

Black Market Foreign Exchange Gradually Stabilizes

After the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee restricted the supply to the Shanghai black market on the morning of the day before yesterday in order to prevent large-scale arbitrage of foreign exchange in the black market, the black market foreign exchange suddenly shrank sharply. However, after the British HSBC Bank agreed to provide as much as possible to meet the legitimate needs of various industries, the exchange rate began to stabilize, market rumors subsided slightly, and public confidence gradually eased. Yesterday morning, HSBC Bank's listed exchange rate for British pounds was five pence and for US dollars was 9.6875 yuan, and it agreed to provide as much as possible at the listed market price. British-American Tobacco Company and Mobil Oil Company, among others, purchased British and American foreign exchange from HSBC and Citibank.

Legitimate Industries Can Apply for Legal Foreign Exchange

A "New Voice News Agency" reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that for the import of essential goods, it is permissible to apply to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee for legal foreign exchange. The customs offices in various places have been ordered to investigate and ban luxury goods, but because the situation in Shanghai is special, luxury goods can still be imported as before. However, since foreign exchange can not be applied to these goods legally, they have to be purchased from the Shanghai black market. The prices of black market foreign exchange have shrunk sharply after the restrictions, and speculators and importers of luxury goods have been hit hard, while legitimate merchants have not been affected in any way.

Tianjin Banknotes Exchanged as Much as Possible

Regarding the banknotes with Tianjin place names, after the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications exchanged them as much as possible in small amounts, the number of people going to the two banks yesterday to request exchange was still crowded. They were all apprentices and partners of small money shops, because these small money shops specialized in collecting banknotes from Tianjin, charging a fee of five cents to two jiao per yuan. After collecting them, they went to exchange them, aiming to profit. However, in order to stabilize the market, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications still exchanged them as much as possible. As for the banknotes with place names from other places of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the China Industrial Bank, and other banks, they can also be exchanged at the designated Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other banks.

Other Banks Fully Usable

After the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications exchanged Tianjin banknotes as much as possible, most banks and stores still refused to use them starting yesterday, but a few have been accepting them with flexibility. As for the banknotes of banks such as the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the China South Bank, the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, the Commercial Bank, the Siming Bank, and the Zhejiang Local Bank, they are fully usable in the market and are treated the same as legal tender, without discrimination, because these banknotes have long been taken over by the Issuing Reserve Committee and have full reserves, which is exactly the same as legal tender. Furthermore, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have telegraphed their head offices for instructions regarding the exchange of Tianjin banknotes, but have not yet received a reply.

Foreign Exchange Arbitrage Plan Fails

A "New Voice News Agency" reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that after the black market exchange rate in Shanghai shrank sharply, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications selectively restricted the exchange of large amounts of Tianjin banknotes, the plan to transport banknotes from North China to Shanghai to arbitrage foreign exchange failed. If the rumor in the market that three to four million Tianjin banknotes were transported to Shanghai on a special ship from Shanhaiguan is true, then after arriving in Shanghai, they will not be able to be exchanged for legal tender with Shanghai place names, nor will they be able to arbitrage foreign exchange in the black market, because the difference between the black market exchange rate in Shanghai and the market price in North China Tianjin is very small. In fact, even if a huge profit is obtained,

Gold Continues to Rise and Discount Rate is High Again

Shanghai's gold gray market continued to rise yesterday after foreign exchange shrank sharply and cash soared the day before yesterday, reaching a high of 3,160 yuan. The listed price of Dalutong Bank was 320 yuan, and the listed price of Xintong Bank was 318 yuan. Furthermore, because the discount on exchange drafts is an improper business and does not comply with the Ministry of Finance's financial policy, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Trust Bureau have decided not to maintain it in the future. Therefore, the discount rate is manipulated by ordinary small money shops, taking advantage of the sharp contraction of the black market foreign exchange to deliberately monopolize it. Yesterday, it rose by 165 yuan, that is, 165 yuan per thousand yuan.

Impact on Public Debt Prices

Affected by the huge changes in the foreign exchange and cash markets, certificate holders sold public bonds to buy foreign exchange gold, so the market was oversupplied. The prices of various unified public debt bonds fell uniformly. Yesterday's closing market prices were: Unified Class A, 57.3 yuan, down 1.1 yuan; Class B, 47.4 yuan, down 1.9 yuan; Class C, 46.445 yuan, down 1.3 yuan; Class D, 45.9 yuan, down 1.05 yuan; Class E, 46 yuan, down 1.445 yuan.

Bank Association Meeting Today

The Shanghai Banking Industry Association's member banks are not fundamentally affected by the foreign exchange collapse, but it does have some impact on their business. In addition to maintaining calmness under the foreign exchange collapse the day before yesterday, they have been preparing a proper response, at one point stopping the supply of all foreign exchange. Yesterday, a banking source revealed that the Shanghai Banking Association will hold a routine meeting of the Executive Committee at its Hong Kong Road office at 3 PM today. At that time, the drastic changes in the foreign exchange market and the aftermath of the rejection of banknotes with North China place names will be discussed. Everything else will be brought up in the meeting.

### New Commander of US Fleet, the Herts Arrive in Shanghai; Changeover on the 25th; Yarnell to Return Home Next Month

Admiral Yarnell, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, who has been cruising in North China waters for nearly forty years, arrived in Shanghai on the flagship Augusta at 12:30 PM the day before yesterday, accompanied by his wife and Chief of Staff Connor. This is Commander Yarnell's last time in Shanghai, and Commander Yarnell came specifically to wait for the new commander, Rear Admiral Hert, for the changeover. As for the new commander

Rear Admiral and Mrs. Hert arrived in port at 2:30 PM yesterday on the President Coolidge, and the American naval community in the city went to the pier to meet them. Commander Yarnell sent a naval launch to welcome them. Rear Admiral and Mrs. Hert disembarked in the pouring rain. According to sources in the American Navy, the changeover

ceremony will be held on the aft deck of the Augusta flagship on the 25th of this month. The ship is currently docked at the head of the American ships in the Huangpu River. Although the whereabouts of the two commanders after the changeover are not yet certain, it is believed that they will stay in Shanghai temporarily for the first week of next month, then

go to North China for a visit. Commander Yarnell will stay in Shanghai for five or six days to say goodbye to friends before returning to the United States with his family on the President Coolidge on August 1st. The new commander, Rear Admiral Hert, is 62 years old this year, born in 1877 in Davis, Michigan, USA, and graduated from the

Naval Academy. He was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1929 and served as Chairman of the General Board of the Navy Department in Washington in 1935 before recently leaving office. He participated in the Spanish World War and both made special achievements. It is reported that Rear Admiral and Mrs. Hert will temporarily reside in the thirteen-bed mansion on Ya'erbe Road in the French Concession, where Commander Yarnell resides.

The "Continental Daily News" stated that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, has been cruising the waters of North China for more than six weeks and returned to Shanghai (the 18th) on his flagship Augusta yesterday. This is Admiral Yarnell's last visit to Shanghai as commander. His successor, Admiral Hart, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the President Coolidge

from Washington today (the 19th). Upon the ship's arrival, Admiral Hart will immediately board a naval launch to the Customs Wharf and go to his residence on land. It is heard that Admiral Hert will reside ashore before taking over as commander of the Asiatic Fleet on July 25th. Information was not available in the city last night regarding his future plans, but it is generally believed that he

will remain in the city until the first week of August before departing for North China. According to records, Rear Admiral Hert served in the Asiatic Fleet fifteen years ago as the commander of one of the two submarines stationed in the Orient. The submarine transported him far to Qingdao. Two decades ago, he served as Chairman of the General Board of the Navy Department

and just left his position. Admiral Hert is originally from Davis, Michigan, and graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis in 1899. After leaving office, Admiral Yarnell will remain in the city for five or six days to say goodbye to friends and is expected to depart for the United States on the President Coolidge on August 1st.

### Discovered Near Airport: Regular Chinese Army

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" stated that guerrilla teams have been fighting around Shanghai for many months. Today, it is heard that Shanghai Chinese have seen regular troops in military uniform wearing the Blue Sky White Sun emblem not far from Hongqiao Airport. There have been very few Japanese troops in the Hongqiao area in recent days, which has caused a lot of attention. Only a small team of Japanese soldiers is occasionally seen passing by on foot or in a car. It is generally believed that most of the Japanese troops have retreated to nearby areas for "exercises" and to search for people suspected of being guerrillas, which is why gunshots have been heard repeatedly in the area.

### Zhejiang Province: Important Meetings

Zhejiang Province recently held two important meetings, one was the Zhejiang West Party and Government Joint Conference, and the other was the Provisional Senate, to discuss promoting wartime military and political party affairs in order to benefit the war of resistance. Both have now closed.

Party and Government Joint Conference

After holding a general meeting for three days, the conference resolved the following cases: (1) Local party departments and military party departments should closely coordinate; (2) Expand the organization of local team party departments; (3) Promote civil movement work in various counties in guerrilla areas, enhance the strength of the war of resistance; (4) Launch wartime education and smash enslavement education; (5) Strengthen wartime mobilization institutions and unify wartime training; (6) Establish farmers' supply offices in various counties in guerrilla areas; (7) Purchase silk cocoons and tea leaves in guerrilla areas; (8) Unify the work pace of various patriotic groups in the war zone; (9) Party, government, and military agencies in the war zone should be effectively linked. All were passed.

Provincial Senate

Held recently in Yongkang, it first reported on the recent political situation: (1) The commutation money for each county has been changed, and the money collected will be retained entirely in the county; (2) The standing teams in each county have been changed to the military service section since July 1, and this has been approved by the Ministry of Military Affairs; (3) The detailed rules for preferential treatment of the families of soldiers on expeditions are being revised in accordance with the opinions of the Senate.

### Japanese Navy's Attempt to Breach Jiaojiang Fails; Blockade Line Troops Bravely Repulse Attack; Wintai Defense Commander Orders Evacuation

The Jiaojiang Estuary in Taizhou Bay, Zhejiang Province, has been thoroughly blockaded by military authorities to prevent any ships from sailing. Mines have been laid there, and additional troops have been stationed to strengthen coastal defenses. As a result, the Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to make incursions, but without success. However, on the 15th of this month, two Japanese warships arrived off the Jiaojiang Estuary and launched motorboats carrying dozens of Japanese naval personnel. Under the cover of Japanese aircraft, they attempted to break through the blockade line. The defending naval forces bravely responded with intense machine-gun fire, inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese boats, unable to withstand the attack, retreated. Their attempt to land also failed. The Japanese aircraft then dropped four bombs on the Haimen Fortress, but no damage was sustained by the Chinese side.

### Japan Notifies Consular Body, Plans to Blockade Northern Fujian, Demanding Foreign Merchants, Warships, and Nationals Evacuate from Three Locations: Sandu Ao, Luoyuan, and Shacheng

Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, sent a message to the consular body here on the 12th of this month, stating that the Japanese side would begin military operations in Quanzhou, Tongshan, and Zhao'an in Fujian Province from July 15th, requesting all ships of third countries, including warships, to leave the three ports immediately, and asking nationals of third countries in the three locations to evacuate. In response, the British side asserted the right of British people to reside in and travel to these locations. Unexpectedly, the Japanese naval authorities, citing military operations, are now planning to blockade three locations in northern Fujian: Sandu Ao, Luoyuan, and Shacheng. Therefore, on the 18th, the Japanese consul notified the consular body in this port of their intention, requesting again that commercial ships and warships of third countries leave the three ports before 8:00 AM (Japanese time) on July 21st, or they might face danger. The announcement stated: (1) The Japanese navy will initiate military operations against Sandu Ao and Luoyuan at 8:00 AM (Japanese time) on July 21st. Warships and ships of third countries along the two locations must evacuate before the deadline. As for Shacheng in northern Fujian, it will be blockaded from 2:00 PM (Japanese time) on July 22nd. All ships, warships, and residents of third countries must also evacuate on time. After the Japanese navy implements the blockade, no one is

allowed to exit these ports, otherwise they will suffer direct damage for which the Japanese side will not be responsible. (2) Obstacles and dangerous objects will be placed near (A) Zhangjiaozui (Chown Point), which connects Sandu Ao and Luoyuan, (B) the connecting line between Nanguanshan and Pingfengshan in Shacheng. (3) The areas near the above harbors will be combat zones, and nationals of third countries should evacuate as soon as possible.

### National Bonds Accepted for Loan Collateral; Remittance Drafts Will Be Paid; Shanghai Awaits Instructions; Discounting as a Temporary Measure

The principal and interest of domestic and foreign debts due on July 31st by the National Government include: (1) the 1915 Sino-French-American Gold Loan, (2) the 1928 Sino-Belgian Gold Loan, (3) the 1934 Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Loan, (4) the 1913 Reorganization Loan, (5) five types of the 1936 National Unification Bonds (A, B, C, D, and E). The above are secured by customs revenue. (6) The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Development Company Loan, secured by salt tax. In addition, there are bonds managed by the Ministry of Transportation: (7) the 1905 Daokou-Qinghua Railway Loan, (8) the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Car Purchase Promissory Notes, (9) the 1904 Zhuluo Railway Loan, (10) the 1913 Longhai Railway Loan, (11) the 1924 Longhai Railway 8% Loan, (12) the 1925 Longhai Short-Term Loan, (13) the Longhai Belgian-Dutch Loan.

Ministry of Finance Prescribes Repayment Methods

In view of the seizure of salt and customs revenues, the Ministry of Finance has successively announced that it will no longer provide overdrafts for debts secured by salt and customs revenues. When tax revenues are allocated and delivered to the Inspector General of Customs as before, the government will simultaneously allocate funds for debt repayments as before to restore the pre-war situation.

Seventh Installment of Principal and Interest of the National Unification Bonds

As of July 1, 1939, the outstanding principal of the 1936 National Unification Bonds is: (1) Type A: 141,750,000 yuan, (2) Type B: 145,500,000 yuan, (3) Type C: 339,500,000 yuan, (4) Type D: 533,500,000 yuan, (5) Type E: 252,200,000 yuan. The seventh installment of principal and interest will be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications on July 31st, in accordance with the regulations. However, since customs revenue has been seized and the government no longer provides overdrafts, this debt secured by customs revenue, like foreign debts secured by customs revenue, has been temporarily suspended.

Four Banks Offer Discounts and Loans

To stabilize the market, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank are offering discounts and loans on the seventh installment of principal and interest of the National Unification Bonds and have decided to start issuing "discount certificates" from July 31st. However, although Shanghai has been divided into six installments, the issue of remittance drafts and cash has been referred to the head office for instructions. According to inquiries from the New Voice News Agency to the banking sector, to prevent legal tender from flowing into occupied areas, Shanghai general-purpose remittance drafts will be issued instead.

### Pawnshops Discuss Lowering Interest Rates

The members of the Shanghai Pawnshop Trade Association are divided into old and new businesses. Old businesses operate in the Chinese-controlled area, while new businesses operate in the concession areas, with separate associations. Government orders are communicated and implemented through the old business association. Considering the soaring prices in the city, which greatly affect the livelihood of ordinary people, the association authorities proposed lowering pawn interest rates at the recent members' meeting to set an example and curb price increases. After discussion, it was decided to temporarily postpone the proposal due to the difficulty of reducing interest rates for both old and new businesses. According to inquiries from the Daguang News Agency to the trade association, the opinions of old and new businesses are generally the same, but the procedures are very complicated and cannot be implemented immediately. The trade association is currently exchanging views on this good deed, and it can be implemented at any time once a concrete decision is made. According to the proposal, the legal interest rate of 1.8% per month would be reduced to 1.6%. However, the number of pawnshops in Shanghai has recently increased dramatically, and interest rates are more than double those of pawnshops. It would be fortunate for the general public if the responsible authorities could compel these pawnshops to reduce their interest rates to the same level as pawnshops.

### British Naval Authorities Send Ships to Strengthen Defense of Chinese Coast, Ships to Temporarily Dock in Hong Kong Waters, Action Intended to Protect Nationals

To protect nationals in various coastal areas of China, the British naval authorities have sent the warship HMS Delight to Xiamen to relieve HMS Dumnonius. HMS Dumnonius has been transferred to Hong Kong, and the shallow-draught gunboat HMS Bee, gunboat HMS Scarab, and submarine HMS Pandora have been dispatched to temporarily dock in Hong Kong waters. In addition, HMS Duchess has been ordered to proceed to Weihaiwei to protect nationals, while HMS Folkestone and HMS Diana have also been dispatched to Shantou and Fuzhou, respectively.

### Cash vs. Remittance Drafts Cause Legal Dispute; Plaintiff Sues for Land Rent and Requests Payment in Cash

Since the advent of discounting methods in the financial market, there have been gains and losses between paying in cash and paying in remittance drafts. Therefore, such disputes in the market seem unavoidable. However, there have been no reports of such disputes being brought to court to seek a clear ruling on which form of payment should be the consideration. However, the case of lawyer Zhu Wenming, who also manages rental properties, suing Hengchang Company for arrears in land rent is an exception. According to the plaintiff's complaint to the civil division of the First Special District Court, Hengchang Company owes more than 850 yuan in land rent for one term. Judge Ni Zheng'ao heard the case yesterday afternoon. Zhu Wenming appeared in court and requested a judgment for the defendant to repay the full amount and declared provisional execution. He also requested that the defendant be ordered to pay in cash, stating that Hengchang Company had previously paid rent in remittance drafts, and the plaintiff suffered losses from discounting each time. Therefore, if the court still orders the defendant to pay in national currency, they will inevitably pay in remittance drafts, and the plaintiff will suffer losses again. Therefore, he requested that the judgment be changed to require payment in legal tender, removing the words "national currency" to avoid complications in future enforcement. Part of the dispute in this case is the difference between "national currency" and "legal tender". The verdict has not yet been announced and will be delivered at a later date.

### Gang of Thieves Apprehended in Jiangsu Hotel, Two Handguns Confiscated

Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective of the Chengdu Road Police Station, learned that a gang of thieves was hiding and plotting robbery in Room 100 of the Jiangsu Hotel at No. 50, Lane 379, Guangdong Road. Therefore, at around 7:00 AM on the 18th, he led Chinese and foreign detectives to secretly raid the address and arrested Zhu Zhangqing from Haimen, Zhu Juxiang (aka Chenxi) from Shanghai, Cai Futing (aka Cai Hong) from Pudong, Ding Chuanlin, and three others.

He immediately reported it to the hotel manager, who called for an ambulance. They were rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Xia is beyond medical help, while Li Xu's life is still in danger. It was later learned that Li had no regular job and had incurred heavy gambling debts, leaving him with no way to make amends, leading him to this desperate measure.

### Bomb Explodes in Hollywood Gambling Den, Wounding Toilet Attendant

At around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 18th), a loud explosion occurred in the Western-style toilet of the famous "Hollywood" gambling den on Yuyuan Road in Western Shanghai. When the gambling den's staff rushed to investigate, they saw that one of the attendants cleaning the toilet had been injured by the explosion and was lying on the ground. The gambling den immediately reported it to the Japanese military police headquarters and the "Police Bureau" in Western Shanghai. The investigation revealed that someone had placed an incendiary bomb there in advance, hoping to cause an explosion and start a fire. However, the toilet had very little wooden structure, making it difficult to ignite. The gambling den is keeping this matter very secret.

### Extortion Case Against Elementary School Principal; Three Defendants Await Sentencing

Yao Tingsen, a 29-year-old Shanghai native who works as a translator for the Public Concession Police, colluded with Yue Qiuxin, a young Cantonese man living with him, at the instigation of Xu Hao, a teacher at Hengmao Elementary School in Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao, to impersonate officials from the French Municipal Council's Engineering Department. Accompanied by a Russian named Mr. So-and-So, they approached Yang Guoping, the principal of Hengmao Elementary School, claiming that he had failed to obtain a permit for the mezzanine floor and extorted 1,000 yuan. Yang's wife, Yuan, negotiated with them and agreed to pay 500 yuan, paying 350 yuan in advance, with the remainder to be delivered to the Central Hotel. As Yang was unable to raise the remaining funds by the deadline, Yao went to demand the money, and the impersonation and extortion were discovered. They reported it to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Yao, Yue, and Xu. The police also found 120 yuan of the stolen money in the drawer of Yao's desk and 70 yuan on Yue's person. They were sent to the Second Special District Court for investigation and detention. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Minsheng continued the trial in the First Criminal Division. The defendants hired lawyer Zhu Yisheng for their defense. Yao Juyi, a lawyer from the French Concession administration, presented the case, charging them with impersonating public officials and obtaining money through fraud. The plaintiff, Yang Yuan, then testified about the circumstances of the fraud. Yao confessed that Xu Hao had told him that the principal owed him wages and asked him to collect the money, leading him to be fooled and go there. Yue's testimony was the same. Xu admitted to instigating the crime. After the court ordered the opening of arguments, it announced the conclusion of the trial and scheduled sentencing for the 26th. The defendants were detained in the detention center.

### Apprentice Clerk from Money Exchange Loses 3,000 Yuan in Legal Tender in Robbery Outside Bank; Two Robbers Apprehended on the Spot, Stolen Goods Recovered

Wang Qingpei from Shandong and Yao Zhengjin from Zhenjiang, recently driven to desperation, devised a sinister plan. The two prepared a bag of lime powder and a bag of counterfeit money and waited all day in front of the Guohua Bank on Henan Road. Whenever they saw someone withdrawing money, they planned to throw lime powder into the person's eyes, then seize the money and drop the bag of counterfeit money on the ground. Their intention was that after the victim discovered the robbery, seeing that the stolen money was still on the ground, they would rush to

pick up the money, and would not intend to pursue the robbers. However, the two had no suitable opportunity to strike. At 9:50 AM on the 18th, Gu Fanghua, an apprentice clerk from the Yikang Money Exchange at No. 263 Jiangxi Road, withdrew 3,000 yuan in legal tender from the Guohua Bank. Wang and Yao saw him and followed him. When they reached the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road, Yao threw the bag of lime powder at Gu's eyes, and Wang stepped forward to seize the money. Dropping the bag of counterfeit money on the ground, they planned to

flee in different directions. At that time, Gu shouted "Thief!" Tang Zengxiang, a Chinese detective stationed in the area by the General Police Station, detectives Zhu Xinjin and Wang Hairu, and Chinese police officers No. 2017 and No. 1426 rushed to the scene from all directions and apprehended the two robbers. The original stolen money was recovered from Wang's person. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, prosecuted them under Article 328 of the Criminal Code. As further investigation was required, he requested a postponement. After Judge Qian Hongye questioned them, he ordered them to be detained pending further questioning at a later date.

### Female Fortune Teller Jiang Tianzhen Robbed While Answering a Call; Diamond Ring Worth 600 Yuan Stolen; Two Suspects Arrested and Sent to Court for Trial

Jiang Tianzhen, a 23-year-old female fortune teller from Hangzhou, studied under the female fortune teller Ling Qing in her early years. She has been advertising her services in Room 511 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road for six years. However, she once worked as a dancer. When she goes out to tell fortunes, she wears a diamond ring worth 600 yuan and a gold watch, and her clothes are modern. This attracted the attention of robbers. A robber named Yao Guisheng had previously called Jiang Tianzhen to tell his fortune. He saw the dazzling diamond ring on Jiang's finger and conceived an evil plan. He colluded with Sun Wenzhong from Ningbo and a man named Mapi and rented Room 316 of the Far East Hotel under the name of Liu Shaogen. At 7:40 PM on the 8th of last month, they called Jiang Tianzhen by phone to come and tell their fortunes. After a while, Jiang answered the call and arrived. Sun Wenzhong came forward and asked her to tell their fortunes. After she finished, Sun, on the pretext of paying the 5-yuan fortune-telling fee, took out a handgun to threaten her. Mapi then used a Western-style shirt to tie Jiang to the water pipe. They then robbed her of a diamond ring, a watch, and more than 10 yuan in cash, worth a total of 717 yuan, and fled with the stolen goods. Jiang reported the robbery to the Zhabei Police Station, requesting an investigation. At 10:00 AM on the 18th, Ding Huaguo, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Police Station, and detective Yin Zhanqing apprehended Sun Wenzhong at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, a police lawyer, presented the case, charging him with robbery under Article 330 of the Criminal Code and requesting a postponement. Jiang Tianzhen also filed a complaint about the robbery and identified the defendant as being present at the scene at the time. Sun Wenzhong confessed. The court ordered him to be detained pending further questioning in seven days. It is reported that the main culprit, Yao Guisheng, was arrested at No. 337, Lane 3, Xiaoshadu Road at 7:30 AM yesterday morning. He confessed that he pawned the diamond ring at the Hongxiang Jewelry Store on Xiafei Road for 460 yuan. Yao is being held for transfer to the court this morning.

### Mother and Children Drown in Huangpu River

At 1:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 18th), a rowing boat from Dongchang Road Wharf in Pudong was about to land at the Yuhang Wharf in the French Concession. A middle-aged woman was holding a child in one arm and leading a six-year-old child with the other. Due to carelessness, the three fell into the Huangpu River together. The six-year-old child was rescued, but the woman and the child she was holding drowned. She was pregnant with another child. It was a tragic scene. The rescued child has been taken back to the police station by a detective from the Customs Water Patrol Police Station, awaiting identification by relatives. At 9:00 AM on the same morning, a modern-looking female corpse suddenly floated up from the Huangpu River at the corner of the Bund Garden. She was wearing a striped silk cheongsam, permed hair, and leather shoes. She was in her twenties. The body was taken away by the Transportation Bureau for burial.

### French Tramway Company Issues Second Batch of Scrip, Valid Until End of September

The French Tramway Company in Shanghai previously issued scrip due to a shortage of copper coins. The validity period was set to expire at midnight on July 31st of this year. As the deadline is approaching and the new currency notes from the Ministry of Finance have not yet arrived in Shanghai, the company has issued a second batch of scrip, valid until midnight on September 30th of this year.

After the issuance of this scrip, passengers using postage stamps will be refused to reduce disputes. However, as the scrip is specified to be invalid after the expiration date, scrip holders hope that the company authorities can specify a redemption location, as the British Tramway Company did, to avoid undue losses.

### Labor Dispute at Liang Xinji Toothbrush Factory Resolved

The Liang Xinji Toothbrush Factory's bristle-inserting department on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession has more than 400 female workers. Wages in the bristle-inserting department have always been better than in other factories. Recently, the price of bristles has risen, increasing fivefold compared to 1926. At the same time, the number of missing bristles discovered in the bristle-inserting department has increased daily. According to the factory's old rules, female workers are fined 3 to 6 cents for each mace of bristles missing. There were concerns that some unscrupulous female workers would rather pay the fine and intentionally cause shortages, thereby profiting from it. To prevent this, the factory has now stipulated that those who are missing more than 2 mace will be fined 6 cents to 30 cents per mace, and wages have been specially increased to show sympathy. However, some female workers prevented other female workers from working, intending to incite a strike. This was discovered by the French Concession Police, who immediately dispatched detectives to disperse the troublemakers. The remaining female workers resumed work, and the strike was resolved.

They rushed to search the premises and arrested He Wenyi from Jiangyin and Zhang Rongbiao from Ningbo.

One hundred taels of opium were confiscated. After interrogation, it was revealed that another 16.5 taels of opium were confiscated at He's home at No. 11, Lane 132, Pike Road.

### Letters to the Editor

To Lawyer Wang Liwu,

Regarding the report in your newspaper about Teng Zijin handing over a property to the Zhenxing Company, the content stating that Zhenyu Company, managed by Liwu, had not obtained land rights and was unwilling to return the deposit is clearly inconsistent with the facts. Zhenxing Company originally had a plan to build a thousand houses in the French Concession. However, after the first batch of twenty-three houses was partially completed, the project was suddenly obstructed by new regulations promulgated by the French Municipal Council, leading to the inability to proceed with the second batch (the sixteen houses contracted by Teng Zijin and others). According to the contract between the two parties, Teng should also bear the losses. Since Zhenxing Company is a shareholder-owned entity, Liwu personally cannot take sole charge, which led to litigation in court. As for the land lease contract, the deposit receipt, the Municipal Council's land measurement receipt, and the fact that the land could not be developed and was subsequently subleased to others, all have been submitted to the court and are on record. However, your newspaper's reporter relied on one-sided statements for publication, which is obviously not an impartial attitude. It is hoped that you will make corrections. Sincerely, Lawyer Zai Liwu, July 19, 28th year.

To the Da Chang Chicken and Duck Store,

Having read the news item in your newspaper's news column on July 19, which reported that a staff member of the Chicken and Duck Store was arrested for selling opium, the content is quite inconsistent with the facts. Chen Xuesong, who has been arrested, was indeed an employee of our store, but before the Dragon Boat Festival this year, due to his violent temperament, his position was terminated. Therefore, regardless of whether the staff member's opium sales are true, they have nothing to do with our store. As for the claim that our store secretly sells opium in addition to selling chickens and ducks, it is truly shocking and unheard of. I don't know what the basis for such a claim is, but I suspect it is the speculation of a reporter. As it concerns the reputation of our store, we urgently request a correction. With best regards to the chief editor of the Shenbao, Da Chang Chicken and Duck Store, July 19, 28th year.

### Case of the Romantic Swindler Jiang Chuangjianqiu, Continued Hearing This Morning, Mao Jianqiu and Others Summoned

Jiang Jianqiu, a romantic thief from Jiangxi, was arrested by the Public Concession Police and brought to the Special First Court for prosecution for defrauding women, defiling them, and stealing their belongings. After being sentenced to five years in prison, the French Police found that Jiang had committed similar crimes in the French Concession. Therefore, Detective Sui Wenzhi transferred Jiang from the Special First Court to the Special Second Court for interrogation and investigation. Jiang confessed to stealing jewelry from the concubine Zhou Jinxiang, Li Didi, the prostitute Xing Sannu, Liu Jindi, and the guides Chen Qunxia and Chen Lijun, and also implicated the actresses Mao Jianqiu, Yu Guifen, and Yao Yuchan, stating that they were also involved and had received gold jewelry, diamond rings, watches, and cash. The French Concession authorities legally prosecuted the case. Judge Qiu Huan concluded the case and awaited judgment. Subsequently, for the sake of prudence, a detailed investigation and cross-examination were required, so the conclusion of the debate was revoked, and it was scheduled to reopen this morning. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now it is known that the Special Second Court has issued summonses, instructing the three actresses Mao, Yu, and Yao to appear in court on time for questioning. Since the occurrence of this case, it has aroused much discussion in society. Under today's trial, the truth will be revealed. It is expected that the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Second Court today will be crowded with ladies attending the hearing. In order to maintain court order, the court will impose restrictions, and the general public may find their efforts to attend in vain. It is also learned that in addition to the Jiang case, the Eighth Criminal Court will also hold a hearing on the Wan Yuan Monk's sex scandal at the same time. It is also heard that Jiang Jianqiu's ingenious technique of using sex to commit theft was taught by his master, and there were two accomplices, Jiang being the last of the three.

### Four Kinds of Vitamins

— Feng Zongying

Science in today's world is truly highly developed. Recently, vitamin E has been invented. It is said that it can be extracted from wheat germ and cottonseed. This vitamin E not only makes a good contribution to fertility for women, but can also promote development. Seeing vitamin E reminds me of the four kinds of vitamins A, B, C, and D that have been invented earlier. Therefore, I will re-describe them to inform the readers:

Vitamin A—Those who lack this vitamin can develop eye diseases. In severe cases, they may even go blind and their development may be hindered. The pathology is actually due to a lack of yellow and purple nutritional foods. Therefore, those who lack this vitamin A should drink more milk and butter, eat pork and egg yolks, and more importantly, eat more yellow pigment foods such as radishes, spinach, and various vegetables, with pig liver being the best.

Vitamin B—People on isolated islands have recently suffered from beriberi, which is characterized by swelling of the feet. There are three causes: (1) recovery from a new illness, (2) not walking on the ground, and (3) lack of nutrition, which in other words, is a lack of vitamin B. If this disease is not treated promptly, and the swelling reaches the chest and abdomen, it may endanger life. Therefore, one should eat more fresh meat, vegetables, and the leaves of green plants. Bran and red beans are even better, as bran contains the most vitamin B.

Vitamin C—Is most abundant in fresh foods such as fresh vegetables, fruits, milk, grape juice, and beans, especially fresh orange juice and tomato juice, which are full of vitamin C. If these foods are lacking, anemia may develop and there may be a life-threatening situation. Many have died from this disease, especially sailors, because they cannot obtain fresh food during long voyages, resulting in yellow skin, emaciation, and depression. However, nowadays, voyages are fast and ships are fully equipped with sanitary facilities, so fewer sailors and passengers suffer from this disease.

Vitamin D—Often, many children cannot walk freely even when they are five or even seven or eight years old. This is because their bones are not strong and they lack alkali and phosphorus, which is vitamin D, leading to a state of rickets. Those who suffer from this disease should eat more milk, cod liver oil, pig liver, and vegetable leaves to supplement vitamin D.

### Midday Nap

— Lu Lishi

In summer, I think seven or eight out of ten people have such a habit: as soon as they put down their bowls after lunch, they start yawning frequently, and they soon find their sweet dreams on the bed. The hotter the weather, the more people "take a midday nap." What is the reason for this? And what is the relationship between this and our summer health? Let's talk about it:

This is a summer issue. In winter, fewer people "take a midday nap." In summer, the climate is so hot. In the city, people sleep late at night. Families with small rooms cannot rest until 11 or 12 o'clock, and they have to get up at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning. Because of the lack of sleep, "taking a midday nap" seems to be the most hygienic way to do it in summer.

But can a person sleep right after eating? Of course, it is best to take a walk after filling one's stomach, or sit quietly for a moment. It is a bad habit to climb into bed immediately after eating. Many people can't resist pacing back and forth after a meal, and their addiction to "taking a midday nap" is already very deep. What is the reason for this? This is because the blood fills the stomach and becomes concentrated, causing the nervous system to become cohesive and causing drowsiness. So, he ignores the fear of stomach problems and goes to sleep. Everyone has this phenomenon.

Can "taking a midday nap" make you fat? Many people must be asking this. Here, I can say it won't. We can often see obese people who are smiling and sleepy. This is due to insufficient metabolism in their brains. The fatter a person is, the sleepier they are, and the sleepier they are, the fatter they become. It is definitely not the case that sleeping all day long will turn a skinny person into a fat person. Moreover, the reasons for obesity are nothing more than "eating a lot"—that is, eating a lot of snacks frequently—and the comfort of material enjoyment without thinking. In addition, the balance of endocrine glands in the human body can also make people obese. But if someone wants to get fat by "taking a midday nap," that is unreasonable.

Taking a "midday nap" in summer, weighing the pros and cons and the facts, is still more beneficial than harmful. A person's energy is limited. Sleeping less at night and resting slightly at noon is not a bad way to make up for it, as long as the time for "taking a midday nap" is limited, half an hour to an hour, no more than that.

### A Week's Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

In the summer, it seems that one should eat more fragrant things to feel healthy. Strangely, many people prefer to eat stinky things. The most prominent is stinky tofu. Every evening, the stalls selling stinky tofu are endless in the streets and alleys, and buyers flock to them. Two pieces of deep-fried stinky tofu, dipped in chili oil and chili sauce, and eaten with two bowls of tea-soaked rice, are infinitely delicious. Stinky tofu is not only popular among ordinary families, but also among gentlemen, ladies, young masters, mistresses, and fashionable ladies living in foreign-style houses. It is said that Mr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, also loves to eat stinky tofu, which shows that it is also a fine dish in the cookbook. My whole family loves this dish. At first, the older children absolutely refused to eat it, saying that it was harmful to health. Unexpectedly, recently they have been assimilated by their sisters, and they also want to try it when they see stinky tofu. We don't often eat the deep-fried stinky tofu from the stalls, but buy the raw ones and deep-fry them ourselves. In addition to cooking oil, soy sauce, sesame oil, edamame, and bamboo shoot tips, we also add some sugar, which makes it very delicious when eaten. In addition, after deep-frying, we braise it with fragrant mushrooms, wood ears, edamame tips, etc., which makes it even more flavorful.

### Rickshaw

— Po Linshan Si

"Having two wheels, 'a cart shaft, and a cart box pulled by a person to walk," this is a very common means of transportation in our cities - rickshaw, a simple and accurate description. In Shanghai, we mostly call it "yellow package car," As for the "foreign car" in Beiping, the "cart boy" in Guangzhou, the "rubber tire car" in Tianjin, and the "Dongyang car" in the mainland, all refer to rickshaws.

Menard, a French businessman in Japan, brought us the first rickshaw from Japan in 1874. We should really be infinitely grateful to him. Because the first rickshaw was transported from Japan, and because its original word Jinriksha is completely a Japanese pronunciation, rickshaws have always been considered to be invented by the Japanese. In fact, it was an American sailor who lived in Japan for a short time, who, for the sake of his sick wife who needed to breathe fresh air, used his brain to invent a car similar to a rickshaw to carry his wife for a walk in the garden. Later, it was discovered by the Japanese, and after several modifications, it became the rickshaw of today.

"Those who are uneducated cannot set up fortune-telling stalls, and those who are unskilled cannot pull rickshaws." These two sentences are originally meant to mock those with low abilities; however, the contempt for rickshaw pullers can be seen from this. There is no harder job than pulling a rickshaw. On the surface, it seems that every rickshaw puller has a body made of steel, but in reality, they are "outwardly strong but inwardly weak." To be honest, two bowls of thin porridge are not enough for them to produce a body of stinking sweat. In addition, they often have their licenses taken away by the police, just like naughty students are often punished by strict teachers. And there are also things like men and women are not allowed to ride together, they are not allowed to carry sick people, and they are not allowed to carry heavy goods... As a result, their livelihoods are increasingly reduced; I believe that if the treatment of rickshaw pullers is not improved as much as possible, one day rickshaws will be eliminated.

### A Word on Dark Crystal Glasses

— (Xu Lu)

Summer has already played its overture. Walking on the road, sitting in the car, all that can be seen is the dazzling light!

In this hot season, most people have a pair of sunglasses on their eyes, with very dark-colored lenses, decorated with charming and lovely colored frames.

Indeed, sunglasses have their own value. The heat of summer is already enough to make people irritable. While running around in the sun, adding to it the dazzling white heat of the sunlight, people become even more tired! However, if you wear sunglasses, it is true that the world in front of you seems to have completely changed. A refreshing coolness, a quiet coolness. Although the heat waves are ruthlessly invading from all directions, this is a physical endurance, but the heart is quite refreshed. At the same time, the degree of endurance also seems to have been reduced a lot. This is not difficult for experienced people to appreciate!

Finally, I want to give a piece of advice to the readers, which is that if you don't wear them, so be it, but if you do, we should pay attention to the lenses of the glasses themselves. Don't be greedy for cheap goods and unknowingly harm your own eyes, resulting in endless losses. It's not about how good they have to be, but they should not harm eyesight. Otherwise, harming one aspect for the sake of another is ultimately not worth it!

A ship in Hong Kong, named Dongyang, was heading to San Francisco. The ship carried twenty beautiful women from Guangdong. On the day of arrival, they were all powdered and rouged, with emerald sleeves and red shirts, gracefully walking ashore together. The locals saw them and were greatly surprised, thinking, "What are these charming women doing in the city? Are they going to engage in prostitution?" They immediately reported it to the local officials. Upon hearing the report, the officials immediately signed an order to arrest them and put them in the police station to await interrogation. When the interrogation came, someone said to them, "This city now prohibits Chinese prostitutes. Anyone who comes here should be bound and executed in the marketplace according to the law. Soon, their beautiful faces will be reduced to red powder skeletons." The women were terrified and cried out in despair. The officials then announced to them, "There is no such thing. We just want to question you briefly. If you have indeed come to this city to prostitute yourselves, you will be sent back to your hometown on the original ship." The women were relieved, but they all did not want to go home and hired lawyers to plead their case, so they were released.

### Gezhi College

The directors of Gezhi College in Shanghai gathered at the British Consulate yesterday. Those present were Mr. Tranlan Ya, Mr. Ni Lie, Mr. Xu Xiecun, Mr. Wang Jintang, and Consul Max. Consul Max said to the group, "I am grateful that the Mixed Court has allocated a fine of one hundred taels to the college, and the Governor-General of Liangjiang has donated one thousand taels. The donation of silver is a great cause for celebration!" Then, Mr. Tranlan Ya stated that he had promised to write to England, requesting various manufacturers to donate Gezhi equipment. He has now received a reply from a large manufacturer, which he presented to the group. The equipment and models that will be sent will arrive in China soon. The directors all expressed their gratitude and asked Mr. Tran to convey their thanks. Mr. Tranlan Ya then announced to the group again, "When we first planned this initiative, we did not dare to hope for much. But judging by the current situation, the prospects for this initiative are great. Therefore, we should expand its scale so that it can revitalize Gezhi and benefit China." The meeting lasted for three hours before it adjourned.

### Briefly Discussing Young Celebrities

— Shangqing

The so-called young celebrities, of course, refer to people who are still young, under forty years old. But because of their young age, although they can all be called celebrities, their demeanor is somewhat different from the old and established ones. At least, they write in vernacular Chinese, so young celebrities can also be called new celebrities.

My views on the status and value of young celebrities are the same as my views on old celebrities, and I will not discuss them. Since everyone considers them celebrities, and they themselves think they are celebrities, I will call them celebrities and say what I want to say.

They generally have some of the habits of old celebrities that people dislike. However, they are not superstitious, they do not have retrogressive ideas, and their future is far above that of old celebrities. They are hopeful. But they also have their fatal flaws, which are enough to corrupt them and contribute nothing to the country and society.

They think of themselves as artists, and artists should have the demeanor of artists, so they show a romantic (Romance) air everywhere. Although they oppose the old celebrities' drinking, smoking opium, and keeping concubines in their words, they inevitably frequent tea houses and dance halls in their actions and pursue "free love." To be honest, they are even worse than the old celebrities in some respects. For example, most of them do not keep their promises, do not take responsibility, and when given something to do, they either procrastinate or simply mess it up. In their opinion, they are romantic artists who disdain to be constrained by this. They are emotionalists who are unwilling to compromise their feelings to do what they should do rationally. They live a muddled life every day, not knowing what they are doing, let alone what they will do in the future. ...

I say this about them without the slightest intention of looking down on them. If they truly have such an undeniable belief in life, I will not criticize them, because everyone has the freedom to choose their own way of life. But I wonder if they have ever thought about this: did we call them to this world to consume themselves in this way? Have they ever thought about this: in a broad sense, they are part of the whole human group, and in a narrow sense, they are part of the human group they contact around them (such as relatives and friends), and they have an absolutely inseparable relationship with all human groups, and their slow suicide will have an adverse impact on the future of all human groups? Are they really at ease? Are they going to be so lost and unrepentant?

I say this without the slightest intention of looking down on artists or anyone who is oriented toward emotion. On the contrary, I have the utmost respect for such people. But I believe that true artists or emotionalists have Shakyamuni, Jesus, and the great religious leaders, Confucius, Plato, and the great thinkers, and even Alexander, Napoleon, and the great military strategists, and certainly not those who simply procrastinate or mess things up. Because true art or emotion is definitely not selfish, lazy, or passive, but rather popular, hardworking, and accomplished. Even if we take Goethe, Byron, and even Wilde, their status at the time and their reputation in later generations were not gained through the romance of art, but through the art of romance; in other words, they have indeed gained something in art, and they do want to express it, so it comes from the path of romance, and they are definitely not going to gain something on the path of romance and to express their art; to put it more clearly: their greatness is definitely not because they can play with women or mess things up, but because of their insights and achievements in art; playing with women and messing things up are just some embellishments that cannot be avoided in life, that is, in art. Otherwise, there are many people who can play with women and mess things up, so why are they not all artists? I ask them to ask themselves: How are they? Aren't they reversing the cause and effect? Aren't they abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial?

In ordinary times, an artist should not only focus on romance. Now, when everyone is working hard to resist and build, they especially should not do this. They have more opportunities than the old celebrities. Don't they want to make some real and true expressions in their hobbies, life, and art? As for what kind of expression is considered real and true, they, like the old celebrities, know it very well and do not need my words.

### Qi Jiguang’s Manuscript by the Spear

— Zou Xiao

I recently acquired a copy of Qi Jiguang’s “Zhi Zhi Tang Ji,” of which “Manuscript by the Spear” is Qi’s collection of poems. The meaning of the title is likely an admiration for the elegance of composing poetry by the spear, although Cao Cao and Qi Jiguang were absolute opposites. The fact that Qi could write poetry amidst the chaos of military life and a deluge of military dispatches truly demonstrates the refinement of a Confucian general. Comparing it to today, such as Feng Yuxiang’s vernacular poems, and Zhang Xianghua and Luo Zhuoying’s quatrains, are they not also poet generals?

Qi Jiguang, a famous general of the Ming Dynasty during the Jiajing and Wanli reigns, had two major accomplishments in his life. One was quelling the bandits in Zhejiang and Fujian during the Jiajing era, and the other was defending the border at Ji Gate in the early Longqing reign. In Zhejiang and Fujian, he moved with the swiftness of a storm sweeping away leaves, so he had fewer opportunities to write poetry. However, at Ji Gate, he was more leisurely, focused solely on defense, so he produced more poetry at this time, even creating a long poem of over a thousand words, “Account of Ji Gate.” His poetry, like his parallel prose, is not very clear and feels somewhat obscure, but not overly so.

He dedicated his whole being to his country. Such declarations are frequently seen in his poems. In a letter he wrote, "Sending a letter to a confidant, not understanding the sound of writing. A man’s heart is like iron and stone, always devoted to serving the emperor." He wrote on horseback: "Three hundred and sixty days a year, mostly spent wielding a spear on horseback." At the Platform of Gazing at the Imperial Palace, he wrote: "Ten years of driving and rushing, the sea's color is cold, a lonely official here gazes at the imperial palace. The heavy frost is all the blood of my heart, sprinkled on the thousand peaks, turning the autumn leaves red." In the Xin Hai year (i.e., the thirtieth year of Jiajing), feeling moved while guarding the border, he wrote: "Every time I endure frost and dew, my eyes are always bright to serve the country." At the Loyal Oath Tower, he wrote: "Striking the oars, the ambition of former worthies, cutting the hem, the grace of national scholars." Feeling moved at Guanling Temple, he wrote: "A solitary official's temples are streaked with rain." At Puning Temple, Qi wrote: "Though a hundred battles can loosen my belt, in my life, I console myself with my loyalty." Rain obstructing travel at the shipyard, he wrote: "Driving and rushing is our lot, not regretting graying hair.

His most famous poem, still recited today, is likely the Victory Song: "Ten thousand hearts as one, Mount Tai can be shaken; only loyalty and righteousness, their spirit soars to the heavens. The commander cherishes us like parents; violating military law, the body is not free. Orders are clear, rewards and punishments are credible, rushing into water and fire, who dares delay? Reporting to the Emperor above, saving the common people below, kill all the barbarians and seek a title of nobility." This song is very good, but the last line seems to have a selfish element, but it is only a way to persuade the masses, with a slight enticement. His own concept is not like that. In “Deep within Military Strategies” he said, "Becoming a noble is not my intention, I only wish the waves of the sea to be calm," which is an excellent answer; he only knows the country, not himself.

The "Chronological Table of Famous People's Birth and Death Years" will not record Qi Jiguang's birth and death. According to the first line of Qi's poem on New Year's Eve of Bingzi, "Fifty springs are separated from the dawn," Bingzi (the fourth year of Wanli) was when he was fifty years old, so his birth year should have been the sixth year of Jiajing (1527). His year of death can be found in the Ming History. He led troops north in the second year of Longqing. "Sixteen years in the Garrison. Half a year after Juzheng's death, the ruler suddenly changed him to Guangdong. Jiguang was depressed and could not achieve his ambitions, forcing himself to go once, and after a year, he retired due to illness. After three years, his salary was confiscated, and Jiguang died." From going north to his death, he spent sixteen years in the garrison, one year as a minor official in Guangdong, and three years at home, which is about twenty years. So, calculating twenty years from the second year of Longqing, his year of death was probably around the seventh year of Wanli (1579). The Bingzi poem should have been written in his office in Guangdong. He did many meritorious deeds for the country, but in the end, he only got impeached and had his salary confiscated, dying in depression. However, even if he encountered adversity, his loyal heart was still for the country. There are such lines in the Bingzi poem: "Do not talk about the past with you, my loyal heart still beats even as white hairs grow sparse." Such a national hero, who always sacrificed his small self for the country, and was both civil and military, is so admirable.

### Red Devil Vasika

— by Maxim Gorky, translated by Di Zhou

"Then... is it good to leave here, to start a new life?"

"Where to go?" asked Aksiunia.

"Anywhere is fine,... I can definitely ask the carousel owner for compensation... According to the law, he cannot refuse to give it. Besides, I still have six hundred rubles on me."

"How much?" she asked.

"Six hundred rubles."

"Ah, you have that much!" she said, yawning.

"Yes,... this money can be used to open a store... and... if I get the money from the carousel owner,... then, let's go to New Bilisk. Or to Samara... let's open a store there,... open one of the best establishments in the town,... take in a group of the prettiest girls,... set the admission fee at five rubles."

"You're bluffing," Aksiunia laughed.

"What do you think about that? It will definitely go smoothly..."

"How..."

"Do as I say... if you like, we can get married."

"What are you saying?" Aksiunia exclaimed, flashing her silly eyes.

"Get married!" Vasika repeated, looking a bit uneasy.

"You and me?"

"That's right..."

Aksiunia burst out laughing. Her body swayed in the chair, the chair creaking, she wanted to laugh heartily, but instead made an unnatural, grating sound.

"What's wrong with you?" Vasika asked, the look of insatiable greed reappearing in his eyes, but she was still laughing.

"What's so funny?" he asked her.

Then, she said, laughing and exclaiming: (Twelve)

### Casual Talk by the Fence (Part 1)

— Yu Tang

I love chrysanthemums, but I love to see those humble wild chrysanthemums that only embellish a sparse fence, not the famous and exotic varieties that have been praised and commented on. Because the former possesses natural charm, while the latter has artificiality. Regarding Ju Peng's opera, I appreciate his singing and acting that are rich in ancient charm, the so-called scholarly air, and reject his recent affected and pretentious pronunciation and singing style. In the winter of the twenty-first year, Ju Peng and Xiao Lou E Yun came to Shanghai, and I went to "see" them every day. Although I had acquaintances in the audience and could sit in the fifth or sixth row, I still couldn't hear clearly what he was singing on stage. Sometimes, it was like watching a silent movie. Ju Peng's pianist would tell me that even he couldn't hear what Yan Laoban was singing on stage, and he could only watch his lip movements and gestures, trying to figure out the tune. It's no wonder, as the Tianchan Theater is really too big. Not long after Ju Peng returned to Beijing, I also went to Beijing, hoping to hear his opera in that small courtyard in Beijing, but he didn't perform there. Later, he accepted an invitation to Hankou, where he stayed for a long time. Normally, I went to his residence every day to hear him practice his voice. He sang while strictly training his pianist, making him follow his tune seamlessly. From that time on, I discovered that Ju Peng had begun to create his so-called "Yan style." He first placed each word on a proper note, paying particular attention to the handling of falling tones and rising tones. Then, he tried his best to use his ingenuity to emphasize every tune, whether long or short, or subtly adding, subtracting, and altering it. He transformed the tunes of painted faces and Qingyi roles, taking them for his own use. Sometimes, I even suspected that he was adopting the tunes of the big drum narrative. This result of painstakingly pushing and seeking perfection made his singing completely move towards the two paths of "delicacy" and "skill." As soon as he opened his mouth, it was "delicate," as soon as he opened his mouth, it was "skillful," covering up all the good qualities of various notes that an old male role should have. Fortunately, Ju Peng still has a deep cultivation. If it were someone else, after such a transformation, it would be a "poverty" beyond description. If the former Ju Peng was like an ancient Chai kiln vase, then the current Ju Peng is like an intricately carved ivory ball. If calligraphy were used as a metaphor, then the former Ju Peng's opera was like Wang Xizhi's Orchid Pavilion Preface, but now he is indeed using the popular "artistic style" to show off to the world. This transformation may be because Ju Peng knew that it was difficult to please the audience with the ancient tunes alone, so for business reasons, he had to open up a new path out of helplessness. Perhaps his belief in the models of his predecessors had wavered, so he made a clever decision, created a new sound, and established a new school. Both explanations have considerable reasons.

After eight years of separation, this time, I expect that he must have brought a bellyful of "new tunes" to give Shanghai people a new experience, because Ju Peng may know better than us that it is impossible to perform opera in Shanghai without "gimmicks."

### Grand Charity Performance

— Zi Yan

Spectacular from July 24th to 30th

The Shanghai Amateur Theater Actors' Charity Performance, after more than two months of preparation, has recently decided to be held at the Golden Theater from the 24th of this month. The theater groups participating in this performance include "Gonghua," "Mutual Aid," "Jiaoyi Society," "Nightingale," "Baolian," "Jingwu," "Hualian," "Fudan," "Yinqian," "Yiyou," etc., a total of ten groups. In addition, there are five theater groups, including "Shanghai Theater Arts Society," "China Girls' High School," "Snow Society," "Lewen," and "Professional Women," that support participation in ticket sales and backstage affairs. It can be called a "grand lineup." Such a joint performance by many well-known social theater groups, whether in terms of repertoire or number of performances, is unprecedented in the history of Chinese drama. Even the Spring Joint Performance of Shanghai theater groups in the spring of 1937 was not so grand. Moreover, this performance is for "charity," which has more social significance than a purely joint performance.

The dates of this performance will last for a week (from the 24th to the 30th), with a total of nine performances, including seven multi-act plays and three one-act plays.

Because it is a charity performance, the tickets are divided into four types: five yuan, two yuan, one yuan, and five jiao. There is also a joint ticket, which allows you to watch every show, with the one-yuan joint ticket selling for only five yuan, and the two-yuan one selling for only ten yuan.

The performance programs and events have been decided, and are now listed below:

July 24th, 8:00 PM, Nightingale Theater Society will perform "Permanent Friends," written by Kang Min and directed by Yu Qie, which also includes a song, composed by Chen Gezhang.

July 25th, 8:00 PM, Hualian Theater Group will perform "Living Drunk, Dying Dreaming," which is the original work of British S. Maugham, directed by Xu Qu.

July 26th, 8:00 PM, Yinlian Theater Group will perform "Postponing Debt Repayment," which is the original work of British Dale, adapted by Chen Mian, and directed by Xia Xia.

July 27th, 5:15 PM, Mutual Aid Theater Group will perform "Flowers Weeping Tears," which tells the story of dancing girl life. The actresses in this performance are all popular dancing girls from various dance halls, which can be said to be a real-life performance. The script was written by Yu Ling and directed by Lan Lan, who played "Mimi" in the previous performance of this play.

July 28th, 8:00 PM, Baolian Theater Group will perform "Before Sunrise," which is adapted from "Swarm of Orioles Flying." The playwright is Shen You, who wrote "Female Ballad Singer" for the Spring and Autumn section of this newspaper, and the director is Lu Si.

July 29th, 2:00 PM, Fudan Theater Society will perform "Love of Life and Death," which is also the original work of British Maugham, translated by Fang Yu, and directed by Wu Renzhi, who is also the director of "At the Beginning of Man."

July 29th, 8:00 PM, Shanghai Amateur Theater Jiaoyi Society will perform three one-act plays, including Wu Tian's creation "Go," Yalunaer's "Old Villa," and Chekhov's "Accomplishing Good Deeds" (this year is the 35th anniversary of his death). These three plays have not been performed in Shanghai, and probably have not been performed in other parts of China.

July 30th, 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM, two performances will be jointly presented by "Gonghua," "Yiyou," and "Jingwu" three theater groups, "The True Story of Ah Q." The script of this "The True Story of Ah Q" was directed by Tian Han, which is different from Xu Xingzhi's version being performed by the Sino-French Theater Society. According to insider critiques, Tian Han's version is the best in terms of writing skills among all his scripts, and it has been performed many times in the inland, but this is the first time in Shanghai. The director is Zhang Jie.

The Shanghai Theater Arts Society originally planned to participate in this charity performance, but because it was busy preparing for a four-month long-term performance, it could not participate in fact. However, it is said that it will perform a special performance during the long-term performance in the future, and the income will be allocated to participate in the performance.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The popularity of Yan Ju Peng reminds me of the downfall of Guan Dayuan

This time, Ju Peng was invited to the Golden Theater, and it was full every day. Even on evenings with strong winds and heavy rain, the attendance did not decrease slightly, which not only broke the record, but also exceeded any expectations. In fact, to be fair, not only has the strange tune not been cancelled, but it is probably even worse than before. Because I mistakenly heard from a friend that his voice had recovered, I went to see the joint performance of Yan, Hou, and Ma, "Entering the Palace," braving the summer heat. As a result, I felt very disappointed. That day, my seat was a bit far, but no matter what, I should not have been unable to hear a word clearly, only hearing a strange tune at the end of each section. After he split with Yan Heng, he acted independently, trying his best to imitate Wang Xiaonong and Cheng Yanqiu. All his contractions and releases, sudden widenings and thinnings, and especially slow places are not found in any Tan school male roles. In conclusion, the delicacy and slowness are imitations of the Dan tunes, and the sudden contraction and release of the endings are taken from the Zai Tiao tunes. A good Tan school male role foundation has been transformed into today's Yan school strange tune. No wonder the people of Beijing call him "French Old Man." This time, he came south to perform at the Golden Theater in the French Concession, and the business was booming. I jokingly said to him, "It's no wonder the French Old Man is so popular in the French Concession."

The news that Uncle Yan was mistakenly reported to have come to the South a month ago caused a sensation in Shanghai, and the extraordinary wealth gained at the Golden Theater this time shows that the psychology of Shanghai's music lovers yearning to hear good operas is indeed too universal and the need is too active. Originally, "things will reverse when they reach the extreme." In the past ten years, the Dan roles have been too prosperous, and the male roles have been too declining. Although Gao Qingkui is said to be too miscellaneous, he still has a good voice and can give the audience a happy listening experience. Unfortunately, he has recently collapsed again. Wang Youchen is not good at relying on, but his voice is sweet and there are really a few Tan flavors. However, he died when he had not visited Shanghai for a long time. (63)

### The Affairs of Female Performers

— (Hai Sheng)

After Wang Xichun appeared on the screen, she often went to the Grand Light, Cathay, and Nanjing theaters to watch movies when she didn't have day shows or filming, as a way to observe expressions and acting skills. According to the director of the Wen Su Chen film, her performance is not bad.

You Linghong is planning to leave the place where she's based after the "Common Dance Mansion" summer program, and is in negotiations.

There is a very strong atmosphere of Jin Biyu returning to the stage. "Common Dance Mansion" is inviting her to appear. She has been away from the stage for a long time, and her appearance this time will definitely cause a sensation.

Chen Yujun found a house in Bao Lian Li. She goes to the Golden Theater at eight o'clock every morning to practice with her teacher, Sun Yaofang. Recently, her delicate body has been unwell, and she eats very little, only some porridge.

Fen Mudan (also known as Qi Meiqiu) has had a toothache for the past few days and goes to the doctor for treatment every other day.

After Yu Xiuxia got sick, her roles were taken over by Chuan Juying. She has returned to the stage since the night before last.

Li Xuefang's English reading is already capable of simple conversations, and she can write very beautifully, which is indeed the result of her devoted study.

Ma Jinfeng and Biyu Lian read the Fuxing Mandarin textbook every afternoon. The teacher is Li Zheng.

Since her partner Guan Wanyou ran away for the second time, Xue Youqin often said generously: "This idea, people's hearts are even more unpredictable."

The Han Suqiu and Su Lan sisters went to the Grand Theater the night before last to watch the thirty-six episodes of Journey to the West.

### Hong Kong Film News

— Yin Jian

Chen Yunshang decided to go to Shanghai on the Russian Empress ship on the 21st because she received repeated telegrams from the Shanghai China United Film Company urging her to come. Li Dashen will travel with Chen.

After Li Zhuozhuo separated from Zhang Yi, she found a new partner, a young man surnamed Chen. This person is neither as burly as Zhang Yi, nor does he have a suave and unrestrained demeanor. Moreover, he is unkempt and his clothes are ordinary. If Zhang Yi is a lion, then this person is like a docile sheep. Li Zhuozhuo's love for him is probably for this reason.

Li Li from Beijing sometimes claims to go abroad, and sometimes claims to organize a film company, after all, I don't know which is true or false. It is rumored here that Li Li and Zhang Yi have the love of living together; Zhang Yi lost to Li Zhuozhuo and won to Li Li, also does not matter.

Lin Chuchu is in Hong Kong, filming "Daughter's Fragrance" for the Sanyou Company. Little star Li Keng is at his side, watching his mother act.
