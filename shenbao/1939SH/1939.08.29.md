### The Fourth Political Upheaval Since Japan's Invasion of China: The Hiranuma Cabinet Overturned Again Yesterday; The Embarrassed Prime Minister, Faced With Military Setbacks, Submitted His Resignation En Masse; General Abe Scheduled to Form Cabinet With General Isoya Appointed as Minister of the Army

Tokyo - Today, the cabinet decided in an extraordinary cabinet meeting to submit its resignation en masse. Prime Minister Hiranuma then went to the Imperial Palace to present it to the Emperor. The reason for the resignation was the failure of diplomatic policy and Japan's complete isolation after the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. (August 28th, Associated Press)

Tokyo - After submitting his resignation at 10:50 AM on the 28th, Prime Minister Hiranuma issued a statement explaining the reasons for his resignation, stating briefly: "Today, due to the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, the European situation has suddenly become complex and fraught with new circumstances. Furthermore, considering Japan's established policies, it is necessary to devise appropriate countermeasures under this changing situation, and I am unequal to this important task." (August 28th, Dōmei News Agency)

Tokyo - Chief Cabinet Secretary Ōta stated at 9:45 AM this morning that the Japanese cabinet had decided to resign en masse. Prime Minister Hiranuma, accompanied by the cabinet members' resignations, entered the Imperial Palace to present them to the Emperor. Cabinet councilors and political officials of various ministries have also submitted their resignations.

To cope with the new international situation, Hiranuma has been exchanging opinions fully with Privy Councilor Konoe and Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa since the 23rd. On the 28th, an emergency cabinet meeting was convened, resolving to implement a general resignation. The Hiranuma Cabinet was appointed on January 4th this spring and bore a heavy responsibility during the complicated international political situation as the Sino-Japanese Incident became more complex, lasting for eight months.

After leaving the Imperial Palace, the Emperor summoned Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa to inquire about candidates for the successor cabinet. Yuasa requested a temporary postponement as he needed to seek the opinion of Elder Saionji. After withdrawing, he met with Privy Councilor Konoe at the Kazoku Kaikan. In the afternoon, he traveled by car to Gotemba to visit Elder Saionji. It is expected that Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa will return to Tokyo in the evening and enter the Imperial Palace to report Saionji's recommendation of General Abe as the successor cabinet.

General Abe Nobuyuki was summoned to the Imperial Palace by the Emperor at 8:20 PM today and formally ordered to organize a new cabinet. (August 28th, Dōmei News Agency)

Tokyo - The successor cabinet will be formed sometime today or tomorrow. However, the fundamental policy for handling the ongoing incident will not be changed in any way. Just as the previous Konoe cabinet, although it resigned, the successor leadership never wavered. Therefore, the successor cabinet will also not change any established fundamental national policies. (August 28th, Dōmei News Agency)

Tokyo - As a result of consultations among the three top army officers regarding the selection of the successor Minister of the Army, it was decided to recommend Lieutenant General Isoya Renkichi, the current Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. Major General Iinuma, Director of the Army Ministry's Personnel Bureau, was ordered by Army Minister Itagaki to rush to Changchun by plane to meet with Isoya. As a result, his consent was obtained. Therefore, the successor Minister of the Army is now internally decided as Lieutenant General Isoya. As for the successor to the position of Minister of Finance, it is generally speculated that the current Vice President of the Bank of Japan, Tsushima Juichi, has a good chance. (August 28th, Dōmei News Agency)

Washington - The general public here does not find the resignation en masse of the Japanese Hiranuma cabinet unusual. Ever since the conclusion of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, it has been known here that there were strong undercurrents within the Japanese cabinet. In addition, Lieutenant General Itagaki, the Minister of the Army, consistently advocated close ties with Germany and Italy. The actions of Ambassador Ōshima to Germany and Ambassador Shiratori to Italy were practically impossible for the government to oppose. This is another reason why the cabinet had to be reorganized. Political figures here say that the conclusion of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union may have caused the Japanese cabinet crisis to erupt sooner, but it is not the sole reason for the cabinet's collapse. The Hiranuma cabinet faced numerous difficulties, with economic difficulties being the most prominent. As the unpopular war against China intensified day by day, it was difficult for the Hiranuma cabinet to remain in power for long. All of this is well known here. The recent rumors from the direction of Beiping that China and Japan were about to begin peace talks may also be related to this. As for what kind of impact the Hiranuma cabinet's resignation en masse will cause, it will only be possible to judge after obtaining more detailed information. What is most desired to be ascertained at this moment is not limited to one aspect. What is most valued by the general public is whether Foreign Minister Arita will be reappointed and whether the "moderate faction" can force the military to comply. (August 28th, Havas)

London - Political circles here all acknowledge that the resignation of the Japanese cabinet suggests that the situation in the Far East is indeed improving. The Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shigemitsu Mamoru, traveled from Maidenhead to London this morning and rushed to his office after arriving at the embassy, refusing to meet with any visitors. As for the rumor that he will be transferred to head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japanese official circles here have not yet received confirmation. (August 28th, Reuters)

### British Government Suggests Six-Month Truce to Germany and Poland to Allow for Calm Discussion of All Pending Issues; British Ambassador Flies to Berlin With Reply

London - According to unofficial news last night, Britain will propose a "six-month truce" to Germany and Poland. This suggestion is said to be part of Britain's reply to Germany. This six-month truce will ease the European situation and allow for a peaceful resolution to be sought calmly. (August 28th, Associated Press)

London - Officials announced recently that Sir Nevile Henderson, the ambassador to Germany, is scheduled to fly to Berlin tonight with a reply to Führer Hitler. (August 28th, Havas)

London - The cabinet approved the reply to Hitler today, which will be published after Ambassador Henderson arrives in Berlin. (August 28th, Reuters)

London - The cabinet held a meeting at noon today, which lasted until 1:00 PM. It immediately approved the reply to Führer Hitler and handed it over to Ambassador Henderson to be taken to Berlin immediately. (August 28th, Havas)

London - Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Polish Ambassador Raczyński at 3:00 PM and is said to have informed him of the main points of Britain's reply to Führer Hitler. (August 28th, Havas)

London - The content of Britain's reply to Hitler is being kept strictly secret. Diplomatic correspondents believe that certain basic events must be included in the reply. According to the Daily Mail, the basic points of the British attitude are as follows: (1) Britain must honor the guarantees it has provided. (2) Britain (like Poland) still believes that all disputes can be resolved in a reasonable and peaceful manner through negotiation or mediation. (3) Negotiations cannot be conducted under the threat of war. Many reports regarding Hitler's communication to the British government must be considered inaccurate and not officially approved. However, journalists say that rather than Hitler having made specific proposals, it is more accurate to say that he has revealed his wishes in a characteristic way. Some say that Hitler raised issues such as colonies. Regarding this point, the diplomatic correspondent of the News Chronicle stated that the British reply will generally urge Hitler to pay attention to the most immediate issues, which must be resolved first. The fate of Danzig and Poland is the problem that needs to be solved urgently at the moment. (August 28th, Reuters)

London - The British government's reply to Führer Hitler is scheduled to be taken back to Berlin tomorrow by Ambassador Henderson. The content will be published in summary form at the same time as Führer Hitler's message. According to informed sources, there are three key points in the reply: (1) The British government is willing to work to resolve various European problems so that the situation can be effectively eased. (2) This solution should be conditional on the establishment of a friendly and peaceful solution to the Polish problem. (3) If Germany takes military action, Britain will certainly resist militarily. All three points have been thoroughly discussed at today's cabinet meeting and will be approved and issued at tomorrow's plenary cabinet meeting at noon. If Führer Hitler can reply by sunrise on the 29th of this month, the House of Commons will convene on the 30th, and Prime Minister Chamberlain will attend and issue a statement. Government officials here also stated that the cabinet resolved that the wording of the British reply must be firm so that Britain's determination to fulfill its commitments to Poland can be made clear to Germany. At the same time, it should also be constructive. For example, Führer Hitler's proposal to discuss arms reduction issues now, while colonial issues can be deferred, is in line with Britain's long-standing views. Colonial and raw material issues should only be discussed after the arms reduction issue is resolved and the European situation is stabilized. Therefore, the reply will also mention this point. (August 27th, Havas)

London - The British cabinet spent almost the entire day on Sunday drafting the reply to Germany. According to the diplomatic correspondent of Reuters, this deliberative time, although inevitably lengthy, is necessary because the current tense situation requires careful consideration of Ambassador Henderson's report and the reply that he will be taking back. Another claim that cabinet members' opinions could not be unified, resulting in so much discussion time, has been officially denied and dismissed as unfounded. It is said that the British government is keeping the French government informed of every stage of the development of the situation and will consult with France on the note replying to Germany. (August 28th, Reuters)

### Hitler's Reply to Daladier: Full of Threats and Discord; Refuses Direct Negotiations With Poland; Demands Return of Danzig and the Corridor

Berlin - The Propaganda Ministry recently summoned journalists after midnight to announce the exchange of letters between Führer Hitler and French Prime Minister Daladier. (August 28th, Havas)

Berlin - Late last night, the following long letter from Führer Hitler to French Prime Minister Daladier was published here: "Prime Minister, I fully understand your doubts, and at the same time, I have never neglected the heavy responsibility I bear for deciding the fate of various nations. I come from the military and know the horrors of war deeply. Therefore, I have done my best in the past to promote understanding between Germany and France. I have publicly assured your country that the return of the Saar region was a prerequisite for this effort. After the return, I stated that we have no further demands on your country. When you visited our country last year, you must have personally seen that our people have no jealousy or resentment towards the 'brave opponent of the past.' Germany's various measures towards the West prove that Germany has recognized the existing German-French borders as final. In other words, we painfully sacrificed the two provinces that originally belonged to Germany but are now your territory. We adopted this attitude and made this sacrifice in the hope that the old grievances between our two countries could be eliminated and the tragedy of 1914-1918 could be avoided from recurring. However, although Germany has voluntarily restrained itself towards the West, it cannot simply accept the Treaty of Versailles in other areas. For many years, I have repeatedly attempted to revise the most intolerable clauses of the treaty through peaceful negotiations, but to no avail. But no matter what, I finally found some peaceful solutions without bloodshed. I think you also recognize that the treaty must be revised. I have made proposals to Poland that would have shocked the German people. Therefore, only one resolution can be proposed. I firmly believe that if Britain had advised Poland to be cautious and not to encourage anti-German movements at that time, Germany and Poland could have enjoyed 25 years of peace. Today, the Polish government, on the one hand, is deceived by the lies of 'anti-German aggression' and, on the other hand, is encouraged by promises of guarantees, has lost its ability to decide independently and is at a loss. In particular, the guarantees provided by Britain to Poland have caused Germany's proposals to the Polish government to be rejected. The Polish people believe that Britain and France will prepare for war for Poland, and they continue to make outrageous demands and impose intolerable terror and economic pressure on the 2.5 million Germans living in the former German region. The Polish authorities' attitude towards Danzig has made the citizens of Danzig feel that they are suffering from foreign violence. As a Frenchman, I know how you will act, but although I am a German, I still hope that you will trust my honor and sense of responsibility and will not do as you have stated in your letter, which I consider to be within your purview. But you must know that a respectable country cannot allow its two million people to be subjected to aggression. Therefore, I have put forward the demand for the return of the city of Danzig and the corridor to Germany. Now, Poland, relying on support, has made it impossible to solve the German-Polish problem through peaceful means. But this problem must be solved eventually, whether by force or peacefully. If a German-Polish war does break out, Germany's motives for engaging in the war will be completely different from Poland's. Germany is fighting to correct unfair treatment, while the motives of other countries to engage in the war are obviously to maintain their unfair treatment of Germany. In fact, enlightened people in our two countries believe that the solution of the Treaty of Versailles is not sustainable. I know the seriousness of this conflict deeply, but I believe that the one who will suffer the most will be Poland. No matter what the outcome of the war, Poland will be doomed to destruction. If our two countries fall into a state of war, not only will you feel pained, but I will also feel the same way. Hitler. (August 28th, Haitong Telegraph)

Paris - The Prime Minister's Office recently issued a bulletin stating briefly: "The French Ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, was received by the German Führer Hitler on the afternoon of the 25th of this month. The Führer immediately asked him to convey a statement to French Prime Minister Daladier, which read, 'The current situation in Poland is intolerable to me and I have no choice but to take various measures to resolve it. It would be regrettable if this were to cause France and Germany to meet on the battlefield.' Prime Minister Daladier, after receiving this statement, immediately submitted a reply, which Ambassador Coulondre conveyed to Führer Hitler. It read briefly, 'France loves peace, but it also faithfully adheres to the commitments it has publicly accepted from other countries. I have worked to establish sincere relations and promote cooperation between the French and German nations in order to maintain European peace. Of those who have made such efforts, the French people consider me to be the foremost. Now that Poland is prepared to explore free mediation, it is incomprehensible for the unrighteous to commence warfare, so long as Germany and Poland have yet to seek a peaceful resolution directly. I am prepared to champion this endeavor.' Führer Hitler received Ambassador Coulondre yesterday evening and informed him that Prime Minister Daladier's proposal could not be accepted. The German Chargé d'Affaires in France, Brauer, also submitted a written notice to Prime Minister Daladier today, rejecting it." (August 27th, Havas)

Paris - Regarding the exchange of views between Prime Minister Daladier and German Führer Hitler, responsible officials here recently stated that this is not a matter of France and Germany conducting separate talks, but rather a direct engagement in the capacity of government authorities to supplement the shortcomings of normal diplomacy. All of this has been communicated to the British government. (August 27th, Havas)

London - The diplomatic correspondent of the Times stated that if someone were to ask why the French government replied to Hitler's message immediately, while Britain was so slow, the answer would be that the German message to France was shorter and the wording more vague than the message to the British government. (August 28th, Reuters)

### If War Breaks Out in Europe, Italy Will Not Immediately Join; Optimistic Atmosphere Suddenly Vanishes

Rome - By the end of last week, the optimistic atmosphere in Italy had almost completely disappeared. The general public here has great doubts about whether Britain can accept Hitler's proposal. According to some sources, if war breaks out, Italy will not immediately join and will wait for others to attack. (August 28th, Reuters)

Tokyo - The Italian Ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Arita at 2:00 PM today and, according to instructions from Foreign Minister Ciano, stated that the Italian government's attitude toward Japan will not be affected in any way by the conclusion of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. It is hoped that the friendly relations of the past will continue in the future. (August 28th, Dōmei News Agency)

When reporters approached to inquire, the person only replied in fluent English, "I don't even know who I am." An hour later, three people drove to Heston Airport, and one of them boarded a German plane and returned to Berlin via the Dutch capital. Who was it coming and going?

Editorial

### An Overview of the Japanese Cabinet Reorganization

The Japanese Hiranuma Cabinet submitted its resignation en masse yesterday morning. The immediate cause was diplomatic failure. Examining the reality, it was actually due to the missteps and embarrassment in the advancement and retreat of the war of aggression against China. Why do we say this? If the Japanese army had been able to drive straight into China, achieve the so-called definite victory, and place Chinese sovereignty under its control, it could have looked down upon the international community and seized whatever it wanted at will. Other countries would have either engaged in armed conflict or simply bowed their heads and obeyed. There would have been no such thing as diplomacy, let alone failure. But the reality is not so. Not only were the Japanese constrained by the situation, unable to do as they pleased, but also every attempt they made went awry. The Hiranuma Cabinet, which lasted for more than seven months, remained at a loss in terms of diplomacy. When the Soviet-German non-aggression pact was concluded, even the empty calls and self-deceiving policies lost their basis. How could the cabinet not collapse? Therefore, it is said that the ultimate cause of the collapse was the failure to achieve the desired results in the aggression against China.

In the midst of its war of aggression against China, Japan prioritized military action against China and supplemented it with various other actions, of which diplomacy was an important aspect. Let's briefly analyze Hiranuma's diplomacy: towards China, it used both hard and soft approaches to undermine the interests of European and American countries, in order to realize its selfish ambition of exclusive control. Towards the Soviet Union, it adopted a policy of forbearance. Towards the United States, it mainly used sweet words and prevarication, pretending to be cooperative. Towards Britain and France, it mainly used exclusion and threats, hoping for absolute submission. Towards Germany and Italy, it took anti-communism as its goal, echoed aggressive actions, and adopted a posture of strengthening anti-communism and concluding a military alliance in order to advance and retreat in general international disputes. These were the ways it dealt with various countries, each with a different face. And it showed people that it was fearless, had endless resources, and had the power to weigh heavily and dominate the Far East, all tied to Germany's support as an ally. But Germany suddenly abandoned the anti-communist role, turned from enemy to friend with the Soviet Union, shook hands in joy, and treated Japan with contempt. This was no different from luring Japan to a high peak and then abandoning it, making it unable to reach the sky or touch the ground. It lured Japan to make enemies and then isolated it, making it have no one to call on. It lured Japan to be the mute corner of a "double act," while Germany itself stepped down first, leaving Japan speechless. In short, it made Japan's diplomacy and international position an unprecedented and absolute failure from any point of view. After the failure, Hiranuma harmed his country and neglected his duty. It was a matter of responsibility and a matter of face. He could only resign, and the cabinet was reorganized as a result. However, observers of this event should not only regard the reorganization of that cabinet as a consequence of Japan's past diplomatic failures, but should regard it as a prelude to Japan's future diplomatic transformation.

It is difficult to predict how it will transform. It is said that the successor to form the cabinet is Abe. Judging from Japanese political history, there are many precedents of those who were ordered to form a cabinet but ultimately failed. Therefore, there is still a question of whether Abe's cabinet will succeed smoothly. As for Abe, one should look at the selection of his cabinet members to see the quality of the new cabinet. After the cabinet members are determined, one should look at the policy direction based on their announced policy guidelines. After the policy is announced, one should look at the reactions of the military and other aspects to see the truth and the future of the policy. For the Japanese politics of the past seven or eight years has deviated from the norm, with the cabinet in name only and the power inverted, which did not start with Konoe and Hiranuma. Therefore, in discussing Japan's foreign policy today, one can only say that its original policy has reached a dead end, so it must change. As for how it will change, there is absolutely no accurate information today that can be used as a basis for discussion. It is not the right time to discuss it.

We sincerely hope to welcome Japan's new cabinet with the best intentions. We believe that Japan's current situation cannot be blamed solely on foreign policy. Therefore, what needs to be changed is not just diplomacy, but its entire national policy. The entire national policy needs to be thoroughly corrected, and a slight change will not solve the problem. If the entire national policy is not corrected, then because the international community cannot be trifled with or deceived, even if foreign policy is changed, it will not be able to save itself from the dead end. This is what we hope the new Japanese cabinet will pay attention to. The most important thing for Japan at present is the war against China. We have learned from various sources that Japan does not want the war to continue. Although it has made various attempts to end the war, they are like stones thrown into the water, only creating slight ripples. This is because it mistakenly believes that the national affairs of two dignified countries can be approached through shortcuts and clever tricks, but it abandons the right path. It is exhausting itself, and going further and further away from the goal. This is no different from squandering one's family fortune, wrapping up limited provisions, and walking an endless road. Which will run out first, the provisions or the road? This is what we hope the new Japanese cabinet will pay attention to. In recent years, all of Japan's military and diplomatic actions have been based on predetermined plans and launched from Tokyo. How can this be explained in terms of discipline? Are they all in line with the wishes of the people? The era of "the people are heaven," "the people are the foundation of the country," and "the people can be made to follow, but not to understand" is over. What about Japan? So, what Japan urgently needs to overcome international difficulties? To overcome difficulties in China? Or should it seek to return various domestic forces to their respective positions in order to overcome domestic difficulties first? If this cannot be done, what can be done? This is what we hope the new Japanese cabinet will pay attention to. All of the above are, we believe, the common feelings of those who cherish Japan.

High-angle artillery and flat-trajectory guns for shooting tanks and armored vehicles are concentrated at strategic locations. The precautions at the port entrance are particularly strict. Guards are stationed at all of Danzig's bridges. The 30-mile-long coastline has been blockaded by coastal artillery. Permanent guard posts equipped with machine guns have been set up on the pontoon bridges on the Vistula River near Kiesmark. Once war breaks out, large units of German troops from East Prussia will be stationed in Danzig via these bridges. The airfield here has also been closed since yesterday, with major preparations being made to use the airfield for the stationing of large units of German aircraft. Although the railways within Danzig are nominally Polish-owned, all railway stations here have been taken over by the Danzig government as of today. According to the German side, the reason for this is to prevent the smuggling of munitions. (Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Expresses Important Views: Discusses the International Situation and the Future of the War of Resistance, Reaffirming the Consistent Unchanging Policy

Chongqing: After this week's memorial service, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek answered questions from news reporters and expressed the following views on the recent international situation and the future of the War of Resistance: A. Reporter: The recent changes in the international situation are very dramatic. How does the Chairman view them? Chairman: Since the Soviet Union and Germany concluded a non-aggression pact, the changes in the international scene have been very rapid. How it will evolve is not easy to quickly judge. However, I am not as surprised as most people think, believing that it is evolving from an inevitable path and will ultimately lead to a direction that is beneficial to the world and humanity, and will certainly be in line with our purpose of resisting Japan. China's two-year resistance to Japanese aggression has in fact prompted people around the world to pay attention to the importance of peace and dare not easily destroy it. The international situation is evolving around this fact. Although there are ups and downs in the current international trend, and the signs are inconsistent, there is obviously a main current, which is the trend that all international changes must follow. This is to oppose wars of aggression and establish international justice. China's two-year War of Resistance is a major factor in creating this main current and trend. If China had not resolutely resisted Japan at the time of the July 7th Incident, what would be the situation in East Asia today? The world would not know what it would become. This is not difficult for any discerning person to imagine. Therefore, we should be more confident in ourselves, uphold our established policy, and fight to the end to achieve our final goal. B. Question: In the Chairman's view, can a European war be avoided? Answer: Only aggressors who deliberately want to destroy peace will hope for a world war. I very much hope that peace in Europe will not be broken. I express great excitement and admiration for President Roosevelt and other politicians who have made great efforts to mediate peace, and I very much hope that they will succeed. C. Question: How will the current evolving situation affect the future of our country's War of Resistance? Answer: The main trend of all current changes is in line with our expectations at the beginning of the War of Resistance. Therefore, the subsequent international developments will also be beneficial to our country's War of Resistance. I believe that at this time, the military and civilians across the country should have the following basic understandings: (1) The gradually favorable international situation in the past two years has been created by the sacrifice and struggle of our countless soldiers and civilians. Today, it can be said that more than half of the predetermined goal has been achieved, but to fully achieve our goal, we must continue to work hard without fear of hardship. Therefore, the military and civilians across the country do not have to focus solely on the evolution of the international situation, but should strive to be worthy of the martyrs and not betray the Three Principles of the People, so as to fulfill our responsibilities in the War of Resistance. (2) Our War of Resistance is primarily for self-preservation. Therefore, from the beginning, we have engaged in the War of Resistance with the determination of independence, autonomy, and self-reliance. We have never harbored any thoughts of reliance, nor have we had any intention of taking advantage of the international situation. We only need to follow the correct path in a down-to-earth manner, and respond to the ever-changing situation with a fixed and unchanging policy. We will surely achieve our goal. I believe that unyielding, self-reliant, and strong, not betraying justice, and not fearing powerful powers is the only foundation of our diplomacy, and it is also the consistent policy of our revolution and War of Resistance. The characteristics of China's War of Resistance and the reason for its inevitable victory lie in this. Looking back over the past two years, no matter how the international situation has changed, China's stance in the War of Resistance has not been affected in the slightest. No matter how difficult it is, we do not take chances, do not lean, and do not have the idea of taking advantage of tricks. We only bury ourselves in hard work and strive to achieve our goals. (3) The military and civilians across the country should know that the attainment of a bright future still requires us to make the greatest efforts to overcome hardships and struggle with a set goal. The international situation is constantly changing. In the process of our long-term War of Resistance, not every change may be beneficial to us. Therefore, when the situation is favorable today, we should be cautious and work harder. We must not be complacent because of optimism, so that even when we encounter unfavorable situations, we will not be shaken by pessimism. In short, our country's War of Resistance has a consistent and unchanging policy and a fixed and immovable goal, and it will never be changed due to the advantages and disadvantages of the international situation. From now on, we should pay more attention to the important responsibilities we bear to the country and the world, and the military and civilians should unite and persevere to the end. Then, the final victory will surely belong to us. In short, our national policy was decided at the beginning of the War of Resistance, and we deeply believe that it will be implemented until the day of final victory. (Dispatch on the 28th)

The session will be very short, and it will probably close on the same day. As for the international situation, political figures here generally believe that peace can be preserved and strongly state that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty is of great benefit to the cause of peace. However, air defense exercises are still actively underway in various places. Young men and women can be seen in the capital wearing gas masks and parading in the streets.

Regarding this matter, the current law stipulates two years of military service for the army and six years for the navy. In the future, it may be extended. Currently, only slightly less than 50% of young people of military service age are actually enlisted and serve as scheduled. In the future, it may be that all of them will be conscripted. If so, the size of the Soviet army could be doubled. All of this will be revealed when the compulsory military service bill is submitted for discussion. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)

### Hong Kong Situation Gradually Eases; Japanese Troops Begin to Withdraw from British Border; German Nationals Ordered to Fully Evacuate; Chinese Side Strictly Prevents Japanese Invasion of Huizhou

Hong Kong. The Hong Kong market is gradually easing today, with fewer depositors withdrawing funds. Chinese representatives and community leaders are holding meetings today to discuss Hong Kong's security and the formation of self-defense groups. The Japanese consul stated that the situation in Hong Kong is not serious and there is no need to order the evacuation of Japanese nationals. The Japanese nationals who left Hong Kong yesterday were returning to their country after their summer vacations. Over 400 Japanese troops in Shenzhen suddenly withdrew to Nantou today, leaving few behind in Shenzhen. Part of the Japanese troops in Shayuchong also withdrew, seemingly moving north. External news indicates that the Japanese have occupied Zhangmutou, intending to invade Huizhou along the highway. Chinese troops are strictly guarding against this.

Japanese troops are currently establishing a Chinese administrative organ in Nantou, headed by a Mr. Zhang, who will be responsible for maintaining peace along the border. (Reuters, 28th)

Hong Kong. Japanese troops began withdrawing from the British border today, leaving only a small number of troops in Nantou and a small number of border patrol soldiers to maintain order. Seven Japanese transport ships arrived at Taishan Bay last night, and the Japanese soldiers concentrated on the New Territories border immediately boarded the ships. The withdrawal of Japanese troops from the New Territories border is intended to show Japan's more friendly attitude towards Britain, which has eased the tense situation in Hong Kong. Earlier, British military authorities reported that the Japanese troops and armaments concentrated on the New Territories border seemed excessive if only intended to attack guerrillas in the area. The concentration of Japanese troops on the border last week caused the British authorities here to take extraordinary defensive preparations, such as evacuating several hundred civilians to Manila. The Hong Kong crisis has turned from danger to safety since Saturday, because the Japanese Consul-General here issued a statement declaring that he does not believe Hong Kong will be directly drawn into the vortex if war breaks out in Europe. He does not intend to advise Japanese people to evacuate Hong Kong. (Associated Press, 28th)

### Sino-German Air Route Expected to Succeed

Chongqing. Since the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the establishment of a direct Sino-German air route has become quite possible. According to well-informed European businessmen here, the new Sino-German air route is expected to be successfully opened. "Condor"-type four-engine German commercial aircraft, traveling from Chongqing via Moscow to Berlin, the German capital, would take three days. In the past, relations between Germany and the Soviet Union were bad, so the Eurasia Aviation Corporation could not open the Eurasia route even if it wanted to. However, since Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact and a commercial treaty, this difficulty has been overcome. According to business people here, after the new route is opened, the speed of French and Dutch commercial aircraft crossing South Asia will naturally be slower. (Associated Press, 28th)

### Anti-British Movement in North China Gradually Slackening

Beiping. The European situation seems to also be affecting matters here. It is heard that although Chinese newspapers have received notices to continue their anti-British movement, Japanese residents here have been instructed by the Japanese authorities not to start new anti-British clamor. Therefore, the general belief is that the recent anti-British movement will be allowed to gradually die out naturally. (Reuters, 28th)

### Flood Impact on Tianjin

Beiping. After Wang Kemin, head of the "Provisional Government," inspected the flooded areas around Tianjin, he met with foreign journalists and stated alarming figures regarding the North China flood. It is said that at least one thousand Chinese people, including women and children, drowned in Tianjin. Five to six hundred thousand people in Tianjin and its suburbs have lost all their family property. He has discussed relief measures with local officials but has not indicated what action he is currently taking to overcome this major problem. Wang believes that all authorities should forget political differences when dealing with the refugee problem. When asked if he thought the blockade of the foreign concessions in Tianjin should be ended, he replied that it was too early to talk about that. Japanese sources estimate that the material losses in Tianjin are at least 400 million Japanese yen, which is clearly a conservative estimate. It is also estimated that the flood has affected more than two million people. A railway bridge between Tanggu and Tianjin was washed away by the flood yesterday, and the train heading to the Northeast Provinces has returned here at night. The bridge break has stranded many foreigners vacationing in Beidaihe. (Reuters, 28th)

### Kong Xiangxi Speaks on Confucius' Legacy

Chongqing. (Continued from yesterday) (3) Confucius' Legacy and National Spirit. Confucius' contribution to China's national culture has been briefly mentioned above. His legacy has had an even greater influence on the national spirit. In all aspects of cultivating national character, developing national thought, strengthening integrity, and maintaining the unity of the people's hearts, his teachings have been clear and have not diminished for thousands of years. At this time of national crisis and survival, it is even more urgent to elucidate his legacy and inspire the people. Confucius' legacy places particular emphasis on moral cultivation. The Way of Great Learning lies in illuminating virtue, renewing the people, and abiding in perfect goodness. Rectifying the heart and making the will sincere are the foundation of cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world. Among these, the most indelible and enduring is the establishment of integrity. This is particularly important and worthy of promotion today in the face of foreign invasion. Confucius said, "He may be entrusted with the charge of a young orphan prince; he may be entrusted with the government of a state or clan; and no great exigency can move him from his principles. Is such a man a superior man? He is indeed a superior man." The so-called immovability in great exigencies is the individual standard of morality. If one can truly achieve immovability, then righteousness can ultimately drive away evil. Therefore, one must be unyielding in great exigencies to be a man who stands tall between heaven and earth, do things that stand tall between heaven and earth, and leave a lasting legacy. Confucius also said, "It is only when the cold season comes that we know the pine and cypress are the last to fade." The essence of this statement lies in the fact that one must learn the permanence of pine and cypress in one's conduct and actions. With the evergreen nature of pine and cypress, one can withstand the erosion of time, remaining unchanged through cold and heat. As for how to achieve immovability in great exigencies, one must pay attention to the distinction between righteousness and profit. Therefore, Confucius said, "The superior man understands what is right; the inferior man understands what will sell." Because the superior man knows to uphold righteousness, he can be a superior man. The inferior man only knows to seek profit, so the inferior man remains an inferior man. This understanding of righteousness should begin with the spirit of "seeing profit and thinking of righteousness, seeing danger and offering one's life." All of this represents the central point of moral cultivation in Confucius' legacy. If one wishes to learn the noble morality of the Sage Confucius, one must first establish integrity. There is no doubt about this. (End of excerpt) (Dispatch, 28th)

### Chongqing Newspaper Comments on the European Situation

Chongqing. Ta Kung Pao published an article today commenting on the European situation and China, saying that China, from the government to the people, sincerely hopes that a European war can be avoided and peace can be maintained. China welcomes the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact because it can weaken Japan's power. At the same time, the newspaper hopes that Stalin will work for peace in Europe. In addition, China hopes for peace in Europe from a purely humanitarian and just standpoint. The newspaper also expresses admiration for the efforts of Britain and France to help small countries resist aggression. If war unfortunately breaks out, we believe that Britain and France will win and hope that they will. Although China is currently fighting Japan bitterly, it does not want war in principle. The newspaper also mentioned the horror of war and cited the bombing of Chongqing by Japanese planes as an example. Therefore, it hopes that Europe can avoid being plunged into war. The newspaper concluded by saying that the German-Soviet non-aggression pact will not affect China's foreign policy, as Britain and France are both enthusiastic supporters of the League of Nations and, along with the United States, are signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty. They are helping us and are our friendly nations. We are fighting for independence, and we are only fighting against Japan. (Reuters, 28th)

### Roosevelt Considers Further Peace Movement; US Government Prepares to Declare Neutrality

Washington. According to reliable sources, President Roosevelt is considering a further peace movement today. He is reportedly planning to seek the support of various Latin American countries for this initiative. (Reuters, 28th)

Washington. At this time of extreme tension in the European situation, the U.S. government has taken various measures to cope with emergencies in the event of war. According to the current Neutrality Act, if war occurs, the President may, at his discretion, determine whether a state of war has been established. If it is deemed to have been established, the various provisions of the current Neutrality Act will be implemented immediately. Therefore, the President enjoys great freedom of action in action. This can be seen from the fact that the United States has not implemented the Neutrality Act since the outbreak of war between China and Japan. According to sources close to the State Department, it is still difficult to predict how the European war will break out. It is possible that Germany and Poland may not fight at all. However, if Britain and France are drawn into the vortex, the United States must immediately state its position. In other words, President Roosevelt must immediately declare the establishment of a state of war without further delay. According to sources in the White House, the declaration of American neutrality has been prepared and is ready for the President to sign and publish at any time. In addition, various laws concerning the protection of the financial activities of the American government and people have also been drafted in case of emergency. Not only that, but the President will convene Congress to reconvene when ordering neutrality, or before declaring neutrality, so as to amend the current Neutrality Act as soon as possible, especially to repeal the arms embargo clauses, so as to meet the needs of the time. Regarding this level, the general impression of diplomatic and political circles is that although opposition members opposed amending the Neutrality Act in June of this year, the situation has changed now that war is imminent. The opposition attitude of these members will naturally be greatly eased, and they should abandon internal political prejudices and make maintaining national unity a priority. However, it is expected that obstinate isolationists and pacifists will still adhere to their original views at that time. (Havas, 27th)

### British House of Commons Meets Today

London. Officials have confirmed that the House of Commons is scheduled to meet tomorrow at 2:45 p.m. (Havas, 28th)

London. It is generally believed that the meeting time of the House of Commons tomorrow will be short, but it will depend on the situation. There will be few speakers and they will be brief. However, other matters may need to be dealt with at that time. All plans required for the war have been prepared and can be implemented in a short period of time. It is said that a war cabinet will be formed with about seven people, and larger groups will handle departmental affairs. It is generally believed that Liberal Party leader Sinclair will respond immediately to the invitation to join the war cabinet, but whether opposition leader Attlee and Labour Party leader Greenwood will be nominated by the Labour Party requires a decision by the Labour Party's general assembly. It is also believed that the necessary contacts will be made quickly. If the situation is urgent and a government of all parties must be formed, it can be formed quickly. It is also expected that former First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill and former Foreign Secretary Eden will join the war cabinet, and former First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper will join the "Great Outer Cabinet." (Reuters, 28th)

### Shen Song Assassinated and Killed in Hong Kong; Shot and Then Hacked with an Ax; Multiple Assassins All Escaped

Hong Kong Correspondence: Shen Song, nephew of Wang Jingwei and former mayor of Foshan, was suddenly assassinated and killed in Hong Kong on the evening of the 22nd. The circumstances are as follows:

Circumstances of the Assassination

Shen Song was the most trusted person of Wang Jingwei. Usually, when Wang met guests, Shen would transmit messages or receive them on his behalf. Shen recently resided on the second floor of No. 613 Cheng Wo Road, Happy Valley, Hong Kong. It is generally said that he had considerable tasks in Hong Kong. However, Shen went to the Anlan Club on the second floor of No. 1 Anlan Street every night, as the club was organized by Shen and his comrades. At 8:40 p.m. on the 22nd, Shen took a car to the intersection of Wyndham Street, Des Voeux Road Central, next to the Entertainment Theatre, and got out of the car. He then walked along Wyndham Street, intending to go to the Anlan Club, when he was suddenly attacked by assassins. It is said that there must have been more than two accomplices, but the number is difficult to prove, because the lights were quite dim at the time and there were not many pedestrians. The assassins must have found out about Shen's movements in advance and followed him to commit the act. When Shen was walking in front of the South China Morning Post (not the South China Daily, which is a propaganda organ), two gunshots were suddenly heard in quick succession. A minute later, a police whistle was heard, and Shen had been shot. However, Shen desperately ran to the corner of the South China Morning Post to take refuge. When he reached the corner, he fell to the ground, at a spot directly below the South China Morning Post's light sign. Judging from the attack, the assassin used his left hand to restrain Shen and approached his right side with a pistol, then aimed at the corner of his right forehead and fired. The bullet entered the right forehead and exited the left forehead. One shot missed. After being shot, Shen began to turn left and walk downwards. Two assassins with axes, one from behind, hacked at the top of his head, and then hacked at his right cheek. Shen was still able to blow a police whistle for help. During this period, Shen resisted with the umbrella he was carrying, so the umbrella head was also cut off, leaving it two feet away from the body. The two axes were discarded in front of No. 8 Lu Wei Kee, opposite the South China Morning Post, four feet apart. One of the axes, the one in the south, still had a paper wrapping on its handle.

The Assassins Escaped

When the deceased fell to the corner of the South China Morning Post, the first to come forward to inspect the scene were Mr. Hanni Lu, the manager of Reuters, and Mr. Stowe Lan Chi, the defender of the Hong Kong Football Club. Soon, dozens of onlookers gathered, and then police detectives arrived at the scene one after another. They were British detective Brook, British police constable No. 44 Brooklynn, Deputy Chief of the Detective Division Deputy Superintendent Shaffton, Chief Inspector of the Central Police Station McCool Ta Bangban, and British police constable Alexander. Superintendent Sha wrapped the two axes and umbrella handle he had picked up with a towel and took them back to the Central Police Station. Afterwards, two plainclothes British soldiers testified that the assassins had fled towards the side street of the Anlan Club. Superintendent Sha, believing that the club was a place frequented by people in political circles, went upstairs with Brook and others to search the premises, but found nothing and retreated. Chief Superintendent Pittard was at a banquet at Deputy Superintendent Scott's residence that evening. After hearing the report, he ordered all detectives to investigate. Two plainclothes British soldiers said they had witnessed the assassins fleeing along Anlan Street after the attack, sneaking into the side street of the Anlan Club, but they could not see where they went, because there was a staircase in that alley that led to An Qing Terrace.

Death Without Rescue

As soon as Chang Hanni Lu and others saw Shen fall, they felt his pulse and knew it had stopped, indicating that Chang had died. However, his mouth was still slightly moving. At 8:50 p.m., an ambulance arrived and took the deceased to Maryknoll Hospital for treatment. When he arrived at the hospital, he was pronounced dead. The body was then transferred to the public morgue in a hearse to await autopsy. That evening, Shen's relatives and friends heard the news and called Shen's home to express their condolences. Shen's family was still completely unaware. But his friends did not dare to show up in person to take care of the funeral arrangements for him, which is also pitiful.

### Punan Guerrilla Force Turns Defeat into Victory; Passengers on the Taikang Ship Detained by Japanese Troops

Punan Correspondence: The Japanese and puppet troops in Punan recently dispatched a large force in six routes to attack the guerrilla forces, making the situation extremely serious. They also stationed heavy troops along the coast and rivers. The local guerrilla force had already dispersed into smaller units, but due to the heavy oppression from the Japanese and puppet troops, they temporarily gathered and formed ten teams. All were lightly equipped and chose strategic locations for ambushes. On the 26th, they engaged in bloody battles in the Tai Ri Bridge and Xu Li Bridge area. More than two hundred Japanese and puppet troops who departed from Zha Port were ambushed near Lu Jia Hui, suffering considerable losses. Unexpectedly, another Japanese team outflanked them from the rear. The Japanese troops at Xu Li Bridge also attacked from the left, and the guerrilla force was attacked on three sides, putting them in a very critical situation. They retreated more than twenty li, but the Japanese troops pursued closely along all routes. Later, another unit of the guerrilla force arrived and joined the battle, charging in from a small path and using twenty machine guns to guard key points. After two hours of fighting, the Japanese rear was cut off, and the guerrilla force took the opportunity to attack. Casualties occurred on both sides, and eventually the Japanese and puppet troops were defeated, and dozens of war trophies were seized. The remnants of the Japanese army began to retreat south, but there were still small-scale skirmishes along the way.

The Taikang steamer, which travels between Shanghai and Jin Hui Bridge Town in Punan to pick up passengers, set off from Shanghai on the 26th of this month. When passing through Zha Port, the Japanese troops ordered the ship to stop. They found 1,700 legal tender yuan on a passenger named Zhang. The money was intended for a certain tooth powder factory on Beijing Road in Shanghai to purchase salt in Punan. The Japanese troops forcefully claimed it was for the guerrilla forces and suspected that the ship was secretly communicating with the guerrilla forces. They detained four of the ship's staff, including one named Shen. At the same time, three passengers, including one surnamed Wang, were also taken away by the Japanese troops and detained. Meanwhile, more than ten Japanese soldiers disguised as sailors and accompanied the ship to Jin Hui Bridge. When the ship arrived near Lu Jia Hui, another ship heading from Jin Hui to Shanghai was passing by, and the Japanese troops searched that ship as well, detaining three passengers, including one surnamed Ni. They were immediately sent to the Minhang Command Headquarters for detention. After repeated requests, the two ships were released yesterday and resumed their normal routes. As for the detained individuals, except for the Zhang, an employee of a tooth powder factory who had been released after providing proof, the whereabouts of the others remain unknown.

### Conflict Between Japanese and Puppet Troops Near Tuncun Village, Wujiang; Caused by Dispute Over Gambling and Foot-binding; Both Sides Suffer Casualties

Suzhou Correspondence: Tuncun Town in Wujiang County (six li from Tongli) appears dilapidated on the surface but is actually quite prosperous, and commerce is relatively developed. However, there are many residents from other places in the town, resulting in a complex mix of people of varying quality. Every autumn, these residents from other places set up gambling tables, enticing villagers to gamble, so gambling is rampant in the town. This autumn, gambling tables were set up as usual, but soon after they opened, the puppet troops stationed in the town learned about it. On the surface, they claimed that the gambling operations might attract bandits and prohibited gambling. Secretly, they asked people to negotiate with the gambling house owners, wanting to monopolize all the tables for fifty yuan per day. However, after being forced to close, the gambling house owners reached an agreement with the Japanese troops stationed in Tongli, paying 1,000 yuan for a license fee and 600 yuan per month as a reward. After obtaining the license, the gambling house owners openly engaged in large-scale gambling. The puppet troops, succumbing to the power of the Japanese troops, had to turn a deaf ear and pretend to be mute. However, this created a deep resentment with the gambling house owners. Around 10 a.m. on the 23rd, several puppet troops went to the gambling houses to cause trouble, using the excuse of searching for bandits to arbitrarily arrest gamblers. As a result, the situation inside the gambling houses was chaotic. When they left, they arrested the owners of the gambling houses and subjected them to severe torture. In the afternoon, the Japanese troops stationed in Tongli received a report and sent forty Japanese soldiers to the puppet troops' headquarters in Tuncun, demanding that the puppet troops release the arrested gambling house owners and gamblers. The puppet troops claimed that the gambling house owners were suspected of collaborating with bandits and refused to comply. Seeing the puppet troops' tough attitude, the Japanese troops became angry and fired the first shot, intending to disarm the puppet troops. However, the puppet troops were also prepared and returned fire. After more than ten minutes of mutual shooting, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the puppet troops. The Japanese forces then used machine guns to mow down the puppet troops, and the puppet troops, because of their inferior guns and ammunition, surrendered. After the incident, an investigation revealed that two Japanese soldiers were killed and five wounded, while twelve puppet troops were killed or wounded. When the Japanese troops left Tuncun and returned to Tongli, fearing that the puppet troops would carry weapons and revolt, they took the guns and ammunition used by the puppet troops back to Tongli.

### Autumn Tides Surge at Woosung Mouth; Guam Hurricane Touches Shanghai – Wind Wings Already Impinging Yesterday but Speed Very Slow – If Direction Turns North, Direct Hit Can Be Avoided – Customs Prohibits Ships from Leaving Port; Wind Quite Strong Last Night

Yesterday, a new hurricane developing over Guam in the Pacific Ocean suddenly changed direction, threatening Shanghai. The Xujiahui Observatory reported at 6:00 AM yesterday that the hurricane had reached 28 degrees North latitude and 128 degrees East longitude, heading northwest with fierce winds. According to the report, the hurricane would pass at a considerable distance east of Shanghai, but its wind wings had already caused drastic weather changes. The wind was strong in the morning, followed by showers at noon, with a sharp drop in atmospheric pressure and a plummeting temperature.

Xujiahui Observatory Report

By 2:00 PM yesterday, the observatory reported that the hurricane had advanced to 28 degrees North latitude and 127 degrees East longitude, its direction changing from northwest to west-northwest, heading directly for Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs immediately hoisted black balls at three locations: the Customs House rooftop on the Bund, the signal tower on Lundy Road, and the Wusongkou Quarantine Hospital lighthouse, warning all ships to take shelter. All sailboats and ferries in the Huangpu River sailed to Lujiazui in Pudong to avoid the storm. At 4:00 PM yesterday, the observatory continued to report that the hurricane had reached 18.5 degrees North latitude and 126 degrees East longitude, with the center of the storm within a 60-nautical-mile radius, and the direction remaining west-northwest. According to the report, the hurricane was only 300 nautical miles from Shanghai and was clearly continuing to move towards the city, but its speed was very slow.

Customs Prohibits Ships from Leaving Port

At 6:00 PM, the Customs received another report that the hurricane was about to reach Shanghai. As it was already late, they changed the signal to two red lights to indicate a ban on ships leaving port, to avoid danger. As a result, the schedules of steamships were changed. The Taikoo Company's Jiangsu and Guangdong steamers, which were supposed to arrive yesterday afternoon, were delayed by the hurricane and may arrive today. The Jardine Matheson's Lishun steamer, coming from Qingdao, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning.

Mail Ship Arrivals and Departures Delayed

The French Mail Ship Aramis, coming from Japan, and the Italian Mail Ship Giulio Cesare, coming from Europe, both arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The American Steamship Company's President Cleveland, coming from Little Luzon via Hong Kong to Shanghai and returning to the US, was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday afternoon but was delayed by the hurricane and only entered the port at around 4:00 PM. The Aramis and the British Company's Kashgar were scheduled to return to Europe today, and the President Cleveland was scheduled to go to Japan to return to the US today. Whether these three mail ships can leave on time depends on today's wind conditions.

Shipping Industry Suffers Great Losses

The Haiyi, Luan, Kaisteng, Lisha, and Deyao steamers, which operate on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, all returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The Deyao steamer usually leaves at 7:00 AM every day, but it is uncertain whether it will operate today. The Haiyi and other steamers usually leave at midnight every night, but all were suspended last night. The Fuhua Company's Jiangding steamer took shelter from the wind at Beisha and did not return to Shanghai yesterday. Lately, the shipping industry has been most affected by hurricane losses.

Wind Force Reaches Twelve

Because the hurricane is only 300 nautical miles from Shanghai, if it continues to move west-northwest, Shanghai will be hit by the hurricane this morning. It is hoped that the wind direction will turn north during the night. According to the report from the Ryukyu Islands received by the observatory the day before yesterday, the wind force reached a magnitude of twelve, which is rare. Even according to yesterday's wind force report, it was still eight. The center of the storm is probably even stronger, so it is worth paying attention to.

Autumn Tides at Woosung Mouth Are As High As The Shore

Recently, autumn tides at the mouth of Woosung have risen sharply, with rapid currents. The water level along the outer roads is as high as the shore, and low-lying areas in Zhanghuabang have become a marsh. This area is where the Japanese military's food supplies are stored, so they have been busy moving them to higher ground to prevent the flooding of giant tides.

Water Level Rises, May Overflow Banks

Shanghai has already been disturbed by the wind tongue, with a wind force of four, with strong winds and rain all day long. Many roof tiles, window eaves, bricks, and glass fragments were blown down. The Huangpu River tide was also stirred up, with the water level rising and threatening to flood the banks. The sewers in Nanjing Road, Guangxi Road, Zhejiang Road, Jiujiang Road, Sichuan Road, Route Sayzo, and Route Foch were all overflowing, and water accumulated along the roads, causing great inconvenience to pedestrians. At zero hour this morning, there will be a high tide. If it coincides with the hurricane, the river water may overflow the banks.

### 100,000 Dans of Wuhu Rice Transported to Shanghai – The Rice Crisis Has Passed – Rice Prices Plunge After Hint from Japanese Side – Daily Demand Reduced by 2,000 Dans Compared to Before – Group Purchase of Foreign Rice Still in Progress

The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that a certain official of the Municipal Council told reporters this morning (the 18th) that the rice crisis in Shanghai has passed. For the past two weeks, there has been a shortage of rice in the two concessions. The Municipal Council requested cooperation from the Japanese military authorities, and they agreed that rice will be shipped to the city in a more regulated manner. On Saturday morning, the first concrete hint of assistance from the Japanese authorities was received, and rice prices immediately plummeted. It is reported that rice prices fell from 50 yuan per dan to 48 yuan on Saturday. This morning, the level fell to 44.5 yuan per dan for the top grade. Those responsible stated this morning that they believe rice prices will continue to fall because Shanghai's usual consumption of 10,000 dan of rice has now been reduced to about 8,000 dan due to conservation efforts. With the assistance of the Japanese authorities, the amount of rice transported from the interior, though not fixed, is claimed by Municipal Council officials to be similar to the amount transported before the current shortage. The Japanese claimed yesterday (the 27th) that the Japanese military authorities have transported 100,000 dan of Wuhu rice to Shanghai in the past two days. This claim has not been confirmed this morning. However, it is understood that a small amount of Wuhu rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and 10,000 bags are expected to arrive here today or tomorrow (the 29th).

Wuhu Japonica Rice Will Soon Flood In

The French-language "Shanghai Daily" of the 28th reports that the "Reformed Government" in Nanjing has been authorized by the Japanese authorities to allow rice to be transported to Shanghai. As a result, a large batch of Wuhu japonica rice will soon flood in. Currently, the first batch of rice, totaling 100,000 dan, has already arrived in Shanghai and will be provided to the residents of the "Shanghai Special Municipality" at a low price. Another batch is about to arrive in succession. After these batches of rice arrive in Shanghai, they will be handed over to the Public Concession and the French Concession by the Japanese authorities.

National Rice Arrived Yesterday

Over 5,000 Bags

A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned from the rice industry yesterday that the new indica rice harvest in Taizhou, Jiangsu this year is excellent, and the price is surprisingly low. Therefore, rice merchants are rushing to purchase it and transport it to Shanghai for sale. The local price, including transportation costs to Shanghai, is only about 18 yuan per picul. Therefore, rice transporters are making a considerable profit. Yesterday, more than 4,000 bags arrived in Shanghai. There were also four carts from Changzhou, with 125 bags per cart, totaling 500 bags transported to Shanghai. Other places such as Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Jiashan have also transported rice here. Wuxi has disappeared due to control relations. In total, 5,500 bags arrived yesterday.

Rice Prices Continue to Fall, Transactions Quiet

After the rice market opened yesterday, because people's minds were stable, buying and selling were unusually quiet. New indica rice fell by about one yuan, to 31.5 yuan. White japonica rice fell by 0.5 to 0.7 yuan, to less than 35 yuan. Sellers still mostly insisted, but buyers mostly took a wait-and-see attitude because major factories and residences have either stockpiled or ordered foreign rice. Only small common people are buying from rice shops, so business is unusually quiet. Those who could sell 50 to 60 piculs on weekdays are only selling 3 to 4 piculs these days, and the market is still seen as falling, so no one dares to purchase.

Japanese Troops in Pudong Intercept Rice Boats

Since the price of rice in Shanghai skyrocketed, distributors and transporters in rice-producing areas, because of the potential for profit, have been purchasing and transporting rice to Shanghai for sale in stages, which has attracted the attention of the Japanese side. Fearing that panic would occur in their occupied areas as well, rice boats that came from the southern Huangpu River on Friday, intending to unload at Suzhou Creek, had 15 boats intercepted and detained by the Japanese troops at Dongchang Road in Pudong, carrying 3,750 piculs of white rice, intending to force them to sell in Nanshi and Pudong. Negotiations are currently underway, and it is still difficult to predict whether they will be released.

Purchase of Foreign Rice Still in Progress

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to the various trade associations in the city, stating that the source of rice in the city is not easy to unblock. This time, the initiative was launched to order foreign rice, soliciting registration from all walks of life, in order to gather purchases and open up avenues and stabilize people's hearts. All the details are published in the newspaper, and I hope you will examine them. In particular, a letter is sent to inform you, and I hope that your association will inform the industry under your jurisdiction. If you wish to join the order, you can go to the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association on the fourth floor of the Pudong Association for registration. It is what we strive for. It is reported that yesterday, Huacheng Textile Company ordered 50 bags, Datong Cigarette Factory ordered 50 bags, China Automobile Materials Company ordered 50 bags, Guangqin Textile Company ordered 350 bags, and Science Instrument Museum ordered 50 bags, totaling 550 bags. Adding the previous ones, it has reached 2,180 bags. The Shanghai Banking Industry Consumer Cooperative and the Amateur Friendship Association have also decided to participate in the Shanghai People's Livelihood Maintenance Association as a group, and will start handling the registration of Saigon rice orders for people in the banking industry from today. All banking industry colleagues can go to the Banking Industry Consumer Cooperative at 334 Nanjing Road to collect registration forms.

### Hopes for European Peace are Rising – Speculated by Diplomatic Circles in This City

The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that a reporter interviewed diplomatic circles in this city this afternoon (the 28th). In their view, the hope for a peaceful resolution of the German-Polish dispute is rising today. It is said that the fact that there has been no action so far is a good omen for the future. German leader Hitler has not rashly started a war but is holding meetings, indicating that the day for proposing suggestions and counter-proposals has not yet arrived. They do not attach too much importance to Hitler's rejection of the French Prime Minister Daladier's suggestion to facilitate direct German-Polish negotiations and his offer of assistance, claiming that at this stage, such a rejection is to be expected.

### Federation of Industries Calls for Adjusting Shanghai's Finances – Order the Four Banks to Expedite the Adjustment of Industrial Finances – Ban Foreign Exchange Speculation and Issue New Remittances

The highest leadership organ of the industrial circles in this city, the Chinese General Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the various important industrial trade associations, because of the restriction of Shanghai's finances by Ma Yinchu of the Ministry of Finance, the crises of various industries have become increasingly apparent. Yesterday, they specially jointly telegraphed the Chongqing National Political Council, requesting consultation with the government, ordering the Central Bank, China Bank, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to expedite the adjustment of industrial finances, and ban foreign exchange speculation, and approve the issuance of new remittances of 50 million . The original telegram is extracted as follows: To the Chongqing Political Council, Speakers Jiang and Zhang, and all the Councilors: Since the war moved west and the national army retreated inland, Shanghai has fallen into isolation. The exercise of political power is restricted in many ways, and industry and commerce have lost their guarantees. On the surface, our government and the people of Shanghai seem to have lost contact and are unconcerned. In fact, Shanghai has always been the headquarters of industry, leading the whole country, and all its rise and fall affects the overall situation. At this time of striving for national survival, the development of new resources is extremely important, and the maintenance of the existing industrial base is also

Not to be Neglected

Because both are to cultivate national strength and benefit the war of resistance. Although Shanghai belongs to an isolated island, with its inherent advantages of position, it still does not lose its position as an economic center. Therefore, even when the government is in extremely difficult times, all financial, judicial, educational, and other aspects still try their best to maintain it, and the various industries in Shanghai can also understand the hard work, regardless of threats and temptations, and support the crisis together. Recalling from the beginning of the war to the present, if the government has any driving force, it will do its best. Our colleagues in the industrial circles have exhausted their meager efforts for the country and the nation over the years. We ask ourselves that our conscience is clear and we have no guilt. Compared with the treacherous people, regardless of

National Interests

Competing to speculate in foreign exchange and speculating for profit, resulting in financial chaos and devaluation of legal tender. The impact is related to the foundation of the country. The Ministry of Finance, in order to remedy the situation, has measures to restrict withdrawals, with good intentions, but the result is that industry and commerce are stifled, and the exchange rate of legal tender shows a downward trend. People with shallow views think that Shanghai is actually a big leak in the economy. Rather than being unable to stop the leak, it is better to give up and concentrate efforts to build the inland. This is actually a failure to deeply explore the actual situation in Shanghai, only an emotional argument, and even an abandonment of food because of choking. The crux of the current chaos lies in the manipulation of the black market by treacherous people, then

Treat the Symptoms

Is to ban illegal speculation. What fault does our industrial circle have? But it is abandoned by our government, and the construction of the inland is what our industrial circle is working hard on every day, only limited by time and resources, and trapped by transportation facilities. It is difficult to achieve self-sufficiency without more than ten years of operation. At present, the inland relies on Shanghai for most of its needs. Detecting this crucial moment in the war of resistance, I especially feel that

Slow Response Will Not Help

Once abandoned and ignored, the industry and commerce in Shanghai will be unable to maintain it, and the collapse will be immediate. What the inland needs can only be given to imports, and the consumption of national power will be ten or a hundred times that of today. According to a survey in the past year, the goods that each factory directly transported and sold to the inland, trying its best to assist the inland, such as yarn and cloth, amounted to 150 million yuan, medicines, vaccines, medical instruments, hygiene materials, and hygiene materials, amounted to 11.6 million yuan, rubber products amounted to 14.17 million yuan, Bakelite canvas and telephone materials amounted to 3 million yuan, and sanitary clothing, undershirts, pants, socks, etc. amounted to 4 million yuan. Daily necessities such as thermos bottles and porcelain utensils amounted to 3.5 million yuan, most of which were sold in the inland. The government's military needs and the daily needs of the military and civilians in various places, our councilors, are all wise people, and will be able to

Consider the Facts

Familiar with the pros and cons, and not be blinded by fallacies. I hope that the government will expedite the maintenance, consult with the government, and order the Central Bank, China Bank, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to expedite the adjustment of industrial finances. All requests to ban foreign exchange speculation and issue new remittances of 50 million yuan, I hope that the central government will expedite approval, supervise and order the implementation, so that thousands of factories can be maintained, and hundreds of thousands of workers will not be forced to be unemployed, and the industrial foundation accumulated over decades will not collapse. Urgent military Chen, I am very apprehensive and waiting for orders.

### Balancing International Payments – Strengthening Trade Management – Adopting Import Prohibition and Quota Licensing Systems – Striving to Maintain Production and Promote Exports of Native Goods – Expecting National Thrift and Self-Encouragement

The Chinese government has implemented strengthened trade management, adopting import prohibition and quota licensing systems, and striving to maintain production and promote exports. Essential goods are supplied with foreign exchange as much as possible, and it is expected that the people of the country will be frugal and self-encouraging. Since implementation, it has achieved great results, and the entire trade has improved. The details are recorded as follows:

Implementing Strengthened Trade Management

In order to balance international payments, reverse the trade deficit, and benefit the war of resistance and nation-building, in March of last year, the government promulgated the Measures for Foreign Exchange Application, the Measures for Import Exchange, and the Measures for Merchants to Transport Goods for Export and Settle Foreign Exchange, implementing preliminary trade management. Since July of this year, the government has re-promulgated the Measures for Banning the Import of Goods in Extraordinary Times, the Rules for Applying for Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods, and the Measures for Exporting Goods to Settle Foreign Exchange and Collect Exchange Rate Differences, implementing strengthened trade management. Since then, import and export trade must be governed by the above-mentioned policies, while restricting imports and encouraging exports.

Emulating Various Countries to Adopt New Systems

The methods of restricting trade in various countries are: First, the import prohibition system. When certain goods are sufficient to hinder domestic production, they are ordered to be prohibited from import. For example, England prohibits the import of dyes, Canada prohibits the import of coal and wood, and Poland prohibits the import of fertilizers. Second, the quota licensing system. Within a certain period, only certain types of goods are allowed to be imported in a certain quantity. Thirty-two countries are currently implementing this system. The Chinese government has now begun to implement it, that is, it has promulgated measures to ban the import of goods, which is to adopt the import prohibition system. For special purposes, it must be approved by the government and issued a special transportation certificate, which is to adopt the quota licensing system.

Essential Goods Supplied with Foreign Exchange

For goods that are not prohibited from import and are essential for the country, the government may apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for legal foreign exchange, but the applicant must pay a balancing fee based on the difference between the legal price and the listed price of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications. In the past, although it was stipulated that various importers could apply to the Central Bank for legal foreign exchange for the purchase and sale of essential goods and raw materials, they actually purchased foreign exchange on the black market. Because the amount of black market transactions was huge, the exchange rate was manipulated by it. If this new method is implemented thoroughly, not only will the foreign exchange obtained by importers be cheaper than the black market, but the price of goods can also be expected to be slightly lower, so that the scope of the black market will shrink day by day.

Maintaining Production and Promoting Exports

Private export trade used to adopt a self-export system, but now it has been implemented under management. For goods with corresponding foreign exchange settlements, it has been changed to thirteen categories such as tung oil, bristles, leather, fur goods, tea, minerals, gallnuts, medicinal materials, wool, silk, ramie, casings, and feathers. Now, except for tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals, which are related to barter compensation and material storage and are controlled by the government for purchase and transportation, the remaining goods are allowed to be freely bought, sold, and transported by merchants. In order to encourage exports, the government has promulgated measures to maintain production and promote foreign sales, implementing methods such as exemption from taxes and donations, substitute insurance for soldiers, facilitating transportation, and accommodating funds to assist merchants in operating export trade.

State-Run and Private-Run Parallel System

State-run export trade has always been handled by the Trade Commission, with the affiliated Fuhua Company, with the responsibility of unblocking accumulated goods, promoting foreign sales, and independently purchasing, transporting, and selling various goods. The goods it operates are tung oil, tea, bristles, minerals, etc. In addition, the China Tea Company and the China Vegetable Oil Company are both state-run trade in nature and have always cooperated with the Trade Commission. Although the future government trade policy adopts a parallel state-run and private-run system, its trend has a tendency to focus on state-run trade due to barter material storage debt and other relations.

Expecting National Thrift and Self-Encouragement

Since July of this year, China's foreign trade, due to the effectiveness of strengthened management, has seen a decrease in imports of foreign goods and an increase in exports of native goods. The overall trade deficit has decreased, and international payments have gradually become balanced. However, the various customs in the lost areas are unable to be reached by the government's power for a while, and luxury goods can still be imported. Therefore, the people of Shanghai and Tianjin must thoroughly reflect and painfully change their past lives. All citizens, at this time of national survival, should save and encourage themselves, and should never enjoy the blessings of luxury again, directly cultivating simple and frugal customs, and indirectly assisting the government in completing the new trade policy.

New Policies Take Effect, Foreign Goods Sharply Reduced

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the Customs yesterday that in July this year, the national trade imported 117.4 million yuan and exported 79.95 million yuan. Due to the effectiveness of the new trade policy, imports have decreased compared to April, May, June, and March, and exports have increased compared to March, April, June, and each month. As for the import of Japanese goods, it was 26.53 million yuan in July, a decrease of 8.06 million yuan compared to June, a decrease of 10.74 million yuan compared to May, and a decrease of 610,000 yuan compared to April. This is sufficient to prove that the import of Japanese goods has been sharply reduced due to the impact of the government's strengthened trade management.

### Tense Situation in Western Shanghai Again – Volunteer Army Deployed for Alert – All Residents of Huacun Moved Out Yesterday – Roads in Concession Patrolled by Italian Army

The situation in western Shanghai became tense again yesterday. Dozens of Italian troops were deployed early in the morning, setting up machine guns on Jessfield Road for alert. All passing pedestrians were strictly searched. It is also rumored that all the residents of Huacun, Lane 455 on that road, were suddenly ordered yesterday morning, for unknown reasons, to have their villages patrolled, and another armed force was stationed in the village.

The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that terrorists in western Shanghai expanded their activities last night (the 27th), forcibly evicting all the tenants from ten houses in Lane 555 on Jessfield Road, and forcibly occupying the houses as "barracks" this morning (the 28th). It is reported that the lane is located in the former residence of Chen Diaoyuan on Jessfield Road, which has now become a large house used as an organization by the terrorists. It is generally believed that these terrorists, who occupied a certain house on Jessfield Road two weeks ago, are trying to clear the key points around their organization. Last night, they occupied all the houses in the lane and evicted all the tenants. Today, people saw people in the lane wearing copper-colored uniforms with green military caps and military box cannons. There were plainclothes armed guards stationed at the entrance of the lane, checking people entering the lane. The Italian Marine Corps continued to conduct routine patrols on Jessfield Road, a concession road within its defense area.

### Polish Residents – Send off Ambassador

The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that the Polish residents of this city held a gathering at the American Women's Club last night (the 27th) to hold a reception for the Polish Ambassador to China, Wieden, who will return to his post in his home country on September 3rd by ship.

### Public Buses – Will Increase Prices – To be Implemented from the First of Next Month – Monthly Ticket Prices Will Also be Increased and Changed at the Same Time

The British-owned China General Omnibus Company, recently, in view of the rising prices of all goods and the soaring fuel gasoline, has decided to increase the price of passenger tickets from September 1. The monthly ticket, originally sold for 12 yuan in national currency, will be increased and changed to 16 yuan. The children's and students' ticket, originally sold for 6 yuan each, will be changed to 8 yuan. The special monthly ticket, originally sold for 22 yuan, will also be increased to 27 yuan.

### Another Batch of Jewish Refugees – Arrives in Shanghai – It is Reported That This is the Last Batch

Yesterday (the 28th), another batch of Jewish refugees arrived in Shanghai. It is said that this is the last batch. Even if there are more arrivals in the future, they will be prevented from landing by the authorities. Yesterday, 619 people arrived in Shanghai, traveling on the Far East Express of the Italian Mail Ship Company, the Giulio Cesare, which arrived at 10:30 am and landed at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou.

### City Chamber of Commerce Explains – Doubts About Commercial Registration

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday received an inquiry from the National Pan-Industry Association regarding doubts about temporary registration of commercial establishments. It immediately replied to the letter, explaining that according to Article 22 of the Commercial Registration Regulations, the prohibition is based on the premise that the trade name of Shop A has been registered. Although Shop A has not yet obtained permission to register, it has not yet obtained the right to use the trade name, and the trade name used by Shop B was used as early as in eastern China. This is only to open a branch in Zulin and use the same name. The name is also different from the so-called "unfair competition with similar trade names." The association may state the situation in the certificate one by one and submit it to the General Economic Department for verification.

### Refugee Relief Association Health Work Report

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Health Committee has released a work report stating that the First Relief Hospital, originally operated by the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association's Refugee Relief Branch at the site of the former Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital, concluded operations in December of last year. On January 10th of this year, the association took over, renaming it the First Relief Hospital of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, with Dr. Jiang Shangfeng as the director.

(3) The association's expenditures: In addition to monthly recurring expenses of 1,000 yuan, medical expenses were calculated at 8 jiao and 5 fen per refugee per day. From the date of takeover to the end of June, a total of 26,542 yuan and 2 fen were spent on recurring expenses and medical expenses. Furthermore, each of the First and Second Refugee Camps has a clinic. From February to the end of June, the First Camp treated 29,957 refugees; the Second Camp, from March to the end of June, treated a total of 8,889 refugees. More detailed information has been included in the association's business report, which is omitted here for brevity.

### Bicycle Shop Owner Disappears, Swindler Extorts Money, Arrested After Plot Fails

Jian Agui, a native of Pudong, operated a bicycle shop at No. 50, Avenue du Général Foch. On June 22nd of this year, he went with a friend to the Luo Chunguo Tea House on Zhejiang Road for a chat and disappeared that day. His wife, Mrs. Liu, asked people to inquire everywhere, but without any results. On the 17th of last month, a swindler named Wang Chengwei went to Mrs. Zhou Liu's residence, claiming that he had learned that Zhou Agui had been captured by the Japanese army and was now in a Japanese facility on Yalu Road in Hongkou. He said that if he had 1,000 yuan, he could use it to try to get him released. Mrs. Zhou Liu mistakenly believed him and immediately raised 100 yuan to give to Wang Chengwei, promising to pay the remaining 500 yuan after Zhou Agui was released. After Wang Chengwei took the money, there was no news for a long time. It was not until around 6 p.m. on the 26th of this month that Wang Chengwei finally went to Mrs. Zhou Liu's residence, claiming that Zhou Agui's case was serious and would require at least 2,500 yuan to secure his release. Mrs. Zhou Liu realized that Wang Chengwei was a swindler and reported it to the French Concession police. Detective Wang Changchun arrested Wang Chengwei. Because further investigation was needed, Wang Chengwei was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday morning. After Judge Wu Kechou questioned him, he ordered the defendant to be detained and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.

### Escort Girl Sues Customer for Rape, Awaiting Investigation and Further Trial

Wang Yunshang, a 17-year-old woman from Nanjing, lived at No. 4, Huile Lane, Yunnan Road. Due to poverty at home, she joined the Xiangdao Society at No. 11, Shaanxi Road, two months ago as an escort girl. However, although Wang was an escort girl, she was still a virgin. Zhang Cantai, a 29-year-old man from Changzhou, had just arrived in Shanghai from Changzhou one day ago and was staying at Room 229 of the Central Hotel at No. 525, Guangdong Road. At around 1 a.m. on the 26th of this month (i.e., the morning of the 27th), Zhang saw a card issued by the Xiangdao Society and called for an escort girl to come and keep him company. After Miss Wang entered the room, Zhang immediately stripped off his clothes and forced her to have sexual relations with him. Although the girl resisted and cried for help, no one responded. Under this violence, the girl's chastity was taken away by Zhang. After the act, Zhang gave Wang 7 yuan and told her to go back. The girl, feeling that her lifelong purity had been ruined in an instant, was unwilling and reported it to the Central Hotel inspector, who then reported it to the Old Zha Police Station. Chinese Detective Wang Shusen and Detective Chen Ruisheng investigated. Because the bloodstains on Miss Wang's cheongsam and underwear were sufficient to prove that she was not acting voluntarily at the time, and after a hospital examination confirmed that the girl's hymen had been damaged, Zhang was arrested. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a lawsuit against him under Article 227 of the Criminal Law. Because further investigation was needed, he requested that the hearing be adjourned. Judge Xiao Xieyi, considering that the case involved morality, ordered that no spectators be allowed in the courtroom. The result was an announcement that the hearing would be adjourned.

### Gang Waits at Sichuan Road Bridge, Specializing in Robbing Passing Merchants, Ma Qinglin Robbed of Goods and Money, Gang Arrested and Sent to Court for Trial

Ma Qinglin, a native of Wuxi, frequently came to Shanghai to purchase goods for sale in Wuxi. Each time he came to Shanghai, he stayed at the Lao Dingsheng Hotel on Fujian Road. At 11 a.m. on the 21st of this month, Ma exchanged a draft at the Hongkang Money Exchange at No. 794, Sichuan Road, for 2,900 yuan. Unexpectedly, when he reached the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhili Road, several robbers suddenly approached him, one of whom pointed a gun at him and took all of Ma's 2,900 yuan in cash. Ma reported the robbery to the police, who accepted the case for investigation. It was not until the day before yesterday that Xue Youwen, a Chinese detective at the Old Zha Police Station, discovered the location where the gang was hiding. He reported this to Chinese Inspector Yun A'gen, who, along with Inspector Zai Jiaju, Detective Gao Yong'an, and Detectives Zhang Xingyan and Zhou Wenqing, searched rooms at No. 46 and No. 70, Southeast Ancestral Hall, Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession, and the Hongxiangyuan No. 2 brothel on Dongxinqiao Street. They arrested six criminals: Yuan Jinf, Ni Xiaoqing, Yang Xiaolin, Jin Hongsheng, Zhang Xiaodi, and the young Xiao Laohu. They seized 125 yuan and 6 jiao in legal tender, a gold ring, and a gold watch. It was found that Yuan and the others usually waited for merchants from the countryside who came to sell goods around the Sichuan Road Bridge and robbed them. That day, because they had not gained anything, they were about to return to their den when they passed the entrance of the Hongkang Money Exchange and saw Ma counting banknotes. So they immediately

seized the opportunity to rob him. The pistol they used was originally brought by Xiao Laohu from his brother Xiao Jinbiao's place in Hongqiao. After obtaining the money, Xiao Laohu was waiting for the No. 2 public bus at the Great World when a hooligan came forward and, using threats, robbed him of the gun. This case was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a lawsuit against Yuan and the others on charges of robbery. Because Yuan and the others had committed other robberies, he requested permission to postpone the trial. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xieyi, he ordered all the criminals to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing for one week.

### Remembering Dingpan Road, Meeting Robbers While Watching a Play

The Yidingpan Road Yin Gong Theater in western Shanghai is located in the middle of Daxilu and specializes in showing "soft" films as a draw, so many people go there. At around 9 p.m. the day before yesterday, Mr. and Mrs. Shi Deshan, who lived on Fuli Li Road in the French Concession, went with Sheng and Yan to watch "The Way of the Submissive Wife." Unexpectedly, just as they arrived at the Yin Gong Theater, four thugs wearing short coats and blue cloth shirts suddenly appeared, each holding a box cannon pistol, aimed at Mr. and Mrs. Shi, and blocked their way, telling them not to make a sound. As a result, they were robbed of two gold rings, a wallet, and more than 100 yuan in cash from their pockets, totaling more than 400 yuan. It is reported that the area is a road built beyond the boundary, and the jurisdiction of the Public Concession Police Department does not extend there, so robberies of those who go to watch plays there are common.

### Fake "Unified Tax Bureau", Corrupt Bureau Affairs, Factory Residents Leaving Their Posts, Fake Bureau is a Plate of Loose Sand

The "Fake Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau" is becoming increasingly corrupt due to the incompetence and excessive habits of "Director" Shao Shijun. Officials in higher positions are only interested in extorting money. For example, the establishment of resident factory personnel was originally intended to facilitate the factory's receipt of tax documents and to monitor the production, storage, and sale of products. In theory, their duties are extremely important and their responsibilities are heavy. They are required to be on duty from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., but recently, most of the resident factory personnel have been leaving the factory after 1:00 or 2:00 p.m. every day, so the goods waiting to be shipped from the factories cannot receive tax permits, which greatly affects the factories' business. Someone reported this to Shao, who, in order to cover up, simply posted a notice to warn his subordinates, but did not take any other measures. To this day, the resident factory personnel still arrive late and leave early. It is also heard that Shao has not been to the bureau for many days due to a major incident, claiming to the outside world that he is on a business trip to another port. As a result, all the bureau's staff are like a plate of loose sand.

### Shanghai Church Elders Pray for Peace

The situation in Europe is rapidly becoming more serious due to the Danzig issue between Germany and Poland, and the world war of 1914 seems likely to be reenacted in the present. The situation is tense, and the scourge of war is imminent. The elders of various foreign churches in Shanghai, concerned that the war would have an impact on the Far East once it broke out, held a prayer meeting for "Prayer for Peace" at the British Church at No. 219, Jiujiang Road on the morning of the 27th, hoping for lasting peace in the world.

### Conspiring to Embezzle Check, Accountant Sentenced, Mastermind Chen Tiancheng on the Run, Check Already Reported Stopped

Wang Nengfu, a local of Standard Motor Company at No. 34, Lane 580, Connaught Road, recently sold a car to a Japanese merchant in Nanjing for 4,700 yuan through a man named Chen Tiancheng, who is now on the run, and paid with a Shanghai Hongkou Bank check. Chen took the check to Shanghai and handed it to Tan Lingen, an accountant from Pudong, on the 29th of last month, instructing him to deposit it in the Shanghai Kenye Bank. Unexpectedly, Tan

suddenly became malicious

and conspired with Chen Tiancheng to embezzle the check, falsely claiming that it had been lost somewhere. He sent a letter to Wang Nengfu to notify him and hid in the Da Shanghai Hotel at No. 23, Tianjin Road, where Chen Tiancheng gave him 60 yuan in legal tender to flee. The 4,700 yuan check,

was taken by Chen

with the intention of cashing it at a bank in Hongkou or transferring the funds to a Chinese bank for use. After the incident was discovered, it was reported to the Gordon Road Police Station. Chinese Detective Li Bochuan arrested Tan Lingen and escorted him to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi continued the trial. The police lawyer stated that during the adjournment, it was found that the check taken by Chen Tiancheng had been

reported stopped to

the bank in Hongkou by the plaintiff and that the funds had not yet been withdrawn. The 60 yuan that the defendant received was from the car company's account, not given by Chen. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed on charges of embezzlement. Wang Nengfu, who is now a compradore at the Great British Soap Company, testified to the process, stating that the only loss was the 60 yuan from the car account. After Judge Jiang questioned the defendant and clarified the facts, he sentenced Tan Lingen to three months of imprisonment as a warning.

### Japanese Sentries Check Smallpox Vaccinations on Bridges, Said to be a Reorganization

Japanese sentries were busy checking the smallpox vaccinations of those entering Hongkou, including foreigners, on the 27th. It is said that the reason for the sudden implementation of the smallpox vaccination check is that it has never been checked since it was first issued on July 1st. This decision is a reorganization, which seems to be a sudden inspection.

### Brief News

### Lack of Small Change, Stores Issue Counterfeit Vouchers, Scoundrels Actually Counterfeit Them, Two Criminals Arrested and Counterfeit Vouchers Confiscated

Ling Quan, a native of Shaoxing (24 years old), lived at No. 63, Tianliao Road. Recently, due to extreme poverty, he privately printed counterfeit vouchers issued by the Yuan Da Nanhua Store at the Wangping Carving Shop on Wangping Street, totaling 1,000 one-fen and five-fen vouchers, and took them home. At around 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, he used two of these counterfeit vouchers at the Baotai and Heshuntai Cake Shops on Haining Road. After the incident was discovered, he was arrested by Chinese and Western detectives from the Weihui Police Station. The above-mentioned counterfeit vouchers, 486 one-fen vouchers and 400 five-fen vouchers, were confiscated from his home and taken to the police station together. Yesterday, he was brought to the First Special District Court. After Judge Jiang questioned the defendant, the sentence was scheduled to be announced at a later date.

### Three Chinese Arrested in Western Shanghai Have Been Released, But They Are Sick and Unable to Work, Japanese Army Persists in Interrogating About Guerrillas

The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reported that the Chinese servants and gardeners of the Hongqiao Road Ball Association have been arrested by the Japanese army since Thursday. Only three servants were released on Sunday, but they were sick and unable to work. The Japanese army is interrogating these Chinese people about the activities of guerrillas in the nearby villages of the ball field. It is heard that their place of detention is in a certain iron-roofed house on Qiunigan Road, and they are not given food. The association is now providing it. The servants in the association have not been arrested and are working as usual, but the task of cleaning up the ball field has been difficult due to the Japanese action.

### Dancer Sues for Defamation, Appeals After Being Sentenced

Lin Aina, also known as Gu Aina, a 19-year-old dancer from the Dahua Dance Hall, is a Shanghai native and lives at No. 12, Ruikang Lane, Beijing Road. This spring, Lin's mother, Gu Zhao, sent a letter to Chuan Fengrong of the Jixiang Yinhua Tang Bookstore in the French Concession, claiming that Aina's chastity had been ruined and demanding compensation of more than 10,000 yuan. Chuan ignored her, believing that the Zhao family was fabricating lies to extort money. Later, Gu Zhao and her daughter spread words to arbitrarily defame Chuan's reputation. Chuan then hired lawyer Wu Jiliang to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing Gu Zhao and her daughter of defamation. After hearing the case, it was ruled that Gu Zhao and Lin Aina had jointly distributed words of defamation and were each fined 100 yuan. In addition, in the civil lawsuit, the defendants were ordered to publish the full text of the judgment in advertisements on the front page of Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao for three days each. Gu Zhao and her daughter were dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, Judge Yu opened the trial. The appellee, Chuan Fengrong, did not attend due to illness. Her proxy lawyer, Wu Chuliang, appeared in court and explained the reason for her absence. Judge Yu verified the situation and ordered that the case be adjourned and that Chuan Fengrong be summoned to court for further questioning.

### Gambling Den to be Found on Weihaiwei Road, Named Mainland Club, Initiated by Zheng and Two Others

Since the rise of gambling dens such as Huahui and gambling dens in western Shanghai, it has been more than a year. Because gamblers are flocking to them, although prices have been rising recently, the gambling dens can still maintain a considerable amount of business. As a result, it has attracted people who covet them, thinking that they can gain heavy profits in one fell swoop. Recently, Zheng, Shi, and Bai have raised capital and rented a Western-style house at a certain address on Weihaiwei Road to open a Mainland Club. It is said that the rent for the house is 1,500 yuan per month, and six months have already been paid in advance. The so-called club claims to be a club for colleagues, but it is believed that this must be a disguise to deceive the authorities.

Respectfully, Upon reading the news article "China Match Factory Workers Demand Salary Increase, Factory Refuses" on the third page, ninth column of your newspaper on August 28th, it is not in accordance with the facts.

Fearing that misunderstandings may occur in all sectors of society, we request that your newspaper promptly correct this as reliable. This above is sincerely offered by the China Match Company to the Shen Bao Newspaper, August 28th.

### Finance, Japanese Cabinet Resigns, Gold Market Morale Greatly Dampened

Yesterday's cash gold spot market conditions outside the market were due to Confucius' birthday and the usual Sunday holiday, so there was still no formal market. However, the market will resume as usual today. Outside the market, the price once reached 4,180 yuan. A certain money exchange, having first heard the news of the resignation of the Japanese cabinet, intended to sell, so it sold 30 taels to a colleague at a price of only 4,110 yuan. Later, around 11 a.m., Reuters also reported the news, which further weakened morale. At noon, the buying price at the money exchange's storefront was only 4,070 yuan, while the selling price was quoted at 4,120 yuan, a drop of about 110 yuan compared to the previous day.

Ornamental Gold Rises First, Then Falls: Silver shops quoted the selling price of ornamental gold at 5 yuan higher in the morning, reaching 415 yuan, then fell back by 5 yuan at 12:15, remaining at 410 yuan. Xin Tonghang once rose to 413 yuan, then 408 yuan (buying price reduced by about 20 yuan), all balanced. As for the overseas silver markets and exchange rates, as well as British pure gold, there were no reports on Monday as usual.

The original collection drafts from the money industry have been incorporated into the exchange draft portion since July.

### Exchange Among Fellow Traders: Ninth Withdrawal of Legal Tender

Since the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association agreed with the three banks to withdraw the principal and interest of the remittance deposits of each bank and money shop in the Bank Reserve Committee and Money Industry Reserve at the end of June, totaling 22 million yuan, in 12 weeks at an average of 95% legal tender, eight installments have already been paid. Today (29th) is the date for the ninth installment. Each bank and money shop will go to the preparation committee to complete the withdrawal or transfer procedures. The market's working capital can increase the cash by 1.8 million yuan.

### Cotton Yarn: First Batch of New Tong Cotton Arrives in Shanghai

Due to the suspension of the financial industry, trading in Chinese and foreign cotton has been inactive, so there have been no transactions in the market. However, 164 bales of Tong cotton from northern Jiangsu have arrived, including more than 30 bales of new cotton. It is heard that the harvest there is good, so the products are excellent, with good body and bright colors, but with some impurities. The market price of old cotton has not been established, and the asking price is generally over 120 yuan.

### Hong Kong Dollar Devaluation: Yarn Market Greatly Affected

The yarn market is currently stagnant because the silver and money industry is closed and funds cannot be paid. Yesterday's market transactions were very few, and the yarn market was sluggish. Due to the still serious situation in Hong Kong and the devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar, the Hong Kong Gang, which has the greatest hope for yarn sales, may be restrained. According to a certain source, Yifeng Yarn has sold 20-count Double Horse yarn to Guang Gang Wanxing for 700 yuan, to be shipped tomorrow, a drop of 5 yuan compared to the previous day, with 10 to 20 bales sold. There have been no reports of transactions from other gangs. 160 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Grain: Indica Rice Floods the Market, Price Drops Sharply by About 2 Yuan, Small Amount of Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai

Du Geng: A total of 35 or 36 ships arrived in Hexia, Songjiang, and Nangang. The Jiangbei Chenxin and other high-quality varieties arrived in more than 5,000 bags, which made people even more nervous. The restaurants on Xi Street were all watching, and customers were also eager to sell, which made the market even more sluggish. All goods fell repeatedly. As a result, thick geng fell by 1 yuan, and new and old high-quality varieties fell by more than 2 yuan due to the flood of goods. Shangxi Geng opened at 38 yuan, then 37.5 yuan, Su Tongkun Geng 37 yuan to 36 yuan, Hexia early and late rice 34 yuan, original bag 37 yuan, Chen Wu tips 32.5 yuan to 31 yuan, new high-quality Sichuan tips 31 yuan to 39.5 yuan, the price has not been established, and only more than 4,000 bags were sold.

Ke Xian: Yesterday, the leading varieties were still strong. Newly arrived Ke Xian from Jiangbei Jingwu continued to arrive in 4,000 to 5,000 bags, and the new Ke Xian from Jiangbei was especially rushed to arrive due to low production costs. Yesterday, customers vied to depreciate and sell, and the price fell sharply by 1 yuan to 1.67 yuan. New Ke Xian from Jiangbei, which previously opened at 34 yuan, was only 32.5 yuan yesterday. The price of old Ke Xian from all routes also fell by a small yuan.

Foreign Rice: There was little buying and selling in the market yesterday. New Saigon was paired for 43 yuan and 3 jiao, with only a few dozen bags. However, it is heard that a small number of goods ordered by grain merchants last month have arrived in port.

### Rice Prices Rebound, Returned Flour Also Plummets

——Wheat Trading Sluggish——

Flour: Yesterday, the flour market factory prices remained unchanged, while returned goods gradually declined. It is reported that when the flour market was at its peak, returned goods were absorbed and sharply raised by hoarding merchants, even exceeding the factory price by 2-3 jiao. Now, it is the opposite, with returned goods lower than the factory price by 2-3 jiao. Yesterday, it was heard that warehouse receipt goods were only selling for 6.20 yuan and 6.156 yuan. Due to the rebound in imported rice prices, local sales have also decreased, customer sales are stagnant, and factories have also notified customers that old warehouse receipts must pay warehouse rent and are subject to other restrictions if they are not picked up. Therefore, warehouse receipt goods are being released in large quantities, and the market is plummeting endlessly. Total market transactions were about 30,000 bags. Foreign flour also followed the market trend and eased. 3,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Hong Kong today.

Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat supply was still continuous. The Changzhou, Wuxi, and Jingkou areas were still accessible. Yesterday, the financial industry observed Confucius' birthday, and the market was closed for one day, so market transactions were relatively poor. The intake of various factories was also lax. As a result, only the Japanese factory purchased three cars of new wheat from Changzhou at a price of 9.10 yuan. The market was particularly sluggish.

### Miscellaneous Grains: In Gale and Torrential Rain, Trade in Miscellaneous Grains, Oils, and Beans is Sparse, Prices Decline Across the Board

Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains, oils, and beans was sluggish due to the financial industry observing Confucius' birthday and very little buying and selling due to gale and torrential rain. Market sentiment was loose, and prices declined across the board. Peanut oil prices remained stable due to scarce supply and continuous demand in Hong Kong and local markets. 400 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were transacted at 60 yuan, and 100 pieces were re-warehoused at 58 yuan. Soybean oil inventories were high, and demand was weak, continuing to fall by more than one yuan. 30 barrels of Kobe-imported Dalian oil were transacted at 56.20 yuan. Only Changzhou cowhide soybeans were agreed upon at 12.50 yuan and 11.90 yuan, with more than 400 bags being purchased from Quanzhou's local market. Other miscellaneous grains only included 140 bags of Wujiang green broad beans, 50 bags of Pinghu green broad beans, and 150 bags of Jiaxing green broad beans.

### Sugar Market: Domestically Produced Yellow and Green Sugars See New High Prices Again

According to a Hong Kong telegram, the price of raw white sugar has risen to HK$9.00. A London telegram showed a slight decline: December at 6 shillings and 1.25 pence, March of next year at 6 shillings and 2.44 pence. Outer warehouse at 44.30 yuan, transfer still at 34 yuan. Tian Gu vehicle white also rose 35 jiao, East warehouse B mark at 47.50 yuan, West warehouse initial mark at 48 yuan, later falling back to 47.80 yuan, the rest according to the withdrawal H mark vehicle red West warehouse at 30.80 yuan, East warehouse 6 jiao, Dutch red a little 45 jiao, spot at 39.60 yuan, transfer at 33 yuan. Local cotton white yuan unchanged, local No. 1 ice sugar rose by one yuan to 48.50 yuan, Jing Ming ice sugar has reached 50 yuan. Domestically produced yellow and green sugars saw new high prices again, opening at 40.50 yuan to 41 yuan, the next grade at 39.50 yuan, with over a hundred bags transacted.

### Dried and Fresh Goods: New Local Lake Lotus Seeds Arrive in Larger Quantities in the Second Batch, Price Drops 18 Yuan Compared to Previous

After the new Hunan lotus seeds arrived, the second batch arrived in larger quantities, and the market softened. It is reported that the total number is over a hundred bags, all being local lake lotus seeds. Yesterday, the price was lowered by 18 yuan compared to the previous level, and sales were brisk.

### Black Melon Seeds Damaged by Rain, Production Price Rises Again

Since the new black melon seeds appeared, very few have arrived. According to a Xuzhou report, continuous heavy rain has further affected production, so the goods on the market are even scarcer, and production prices have surged. Currently, Ji Kui seeds are 42 yuan, Ji Zhong seeds 39 yuan, Ti Zhuang seeds 36 yuan, and Xu Kui seeds 33 yuan.

### Seafood: Domestically Produced Sea Shrimp Have Already Started Selling

Since the new Yantai sea shrimp entered the market, they have been affected by inferior goods. The previous market only had offers but no transactions. However, according to recent news from the production area, this year's shipments are extremely scarce, and further supplies may be cut off. As a result, the trend has turned firm. Yesterday, medium-sized strips sold for 73 yuan, and thin strips for 83 yuan.

### Tapioca Starch Continues to Be Tight

Tapioca starch stocks here are low, and sales continue steadily. Recently, the Flying Unicorn brand sold for 26 yuan, and the 3X and KG brands both sold for 25 yuan, an increase of one yuan compared to before. The Double T brand was 24 yuan, up 1.5 yuan, and the Triple T brand was 18 yuan, up 2 yuan.

### Hardware: American Galvanized Iron Soars

The American galvanized iron market is very active. Businesses from Ningbo, Fuzhou, Qingdao, and other places are all purchasing. It is reported that yesterday, 200-300 bundles were offered on the market. Local transactions were also strong, leading to firm sentiment. Prices steadily rose.

Current offering prices are: No. 18 to No. 22 selling for 60 yuan per bundle, No. 24 selling for 65 yuan per bundle, No. 26 selling for 67 yuan, and No. 28 opening at 70 yuan. 3 feet by 7 feet sheets are required to be 6.5 yuan per sheet, an improvement of about 10% compared to before. It is reported that overseas orders are not large, so it is feared that Shanghai's market will be difficult to return to normal in the short term.

### Piece Goods: Woolen Fabrics Rise Sharply

Yesterday, regardless of autumn or winter goods, suiting materials, or Chinese clothing materials, all kinds of thick and thin serge, tweed, overcoating, raincoat fabrics, Watercloth, plush, floral cloth, black carbon lining, horsehair satin, and rayon feather yarn continued to rise sharply. As sales are about to boom, local customers are already inquiring. Those holding goods regard old stocks as treasures due to the high cost of new goods. Market sentiment is tight. The guild's official price yesterday for floral cloth was 1 yuan per yard wholesale, black carbon lining first grade 1.60 yuan, second grade 1.80 yuan, third grade 1.50 yuan, ten horsehair satin first grade 1 yuan, second grade 7 jiao, rayon feather yarn first grade 1 yuan, second grade 8.5 jiao, third grade 7.5 jiao, fourth grade 6.6 jiao.

### On the "Hidden" in the Literary World (Part 1)

— Qin Lao

The "hidden" I am talking about now is the "hidden" in "hidden surname" or "hidden name."

It seems that nowadays, publishing articles under a pen name has become a crime again according to the "new constitution" established by some literati in the literary world. If the article is critical, it further confirms this crime, which is called "hiding" to say pretty things.

So, the "literati" who have been criticized are roaring, "Come out! If you're a hero, come out!"

In fact, this issue has been going on for a long time in the literary world. Anyone who knows a little about the history of the literary world will probably remember that there were two periods when pen names were hated, and writers who used pen names were subjected to dishonorable attacks.

The first period was more than ten years ago. At that time, the Creation Society and the Literary Research Society were fighting, and pen names were a major cause of the quarrel. Someone on one side used a pen name to publish an article scolding the other side, and the other side pointed out that it was "theft," and the writers on this side immediately published a notice, solemnly declaring that they never used pen names, as if pen names were simply not for human use. This battle lasted for a long time, until the writers who opposed pen names also started using pen names, and they were ridiculed by the writers who had previously been labeled as "theft." In fact, in all fairness, it is not a heinous crime for writers to use pen names, and it cannot be linked to "theft" in any way. However, the literary world was indeed very pure at that time. Neither side had any connection with the "officialdom," and the writers were still quite old-fashioned. They did not seem to know the method of putting a hat on the enemy that could lead to their death. So, it was not wrong to say that people who wrote articles at that time should not "hide" and should come forward with their real names.

The second period was only seven or eight years ago. The times had changed at that time. A large number of writers were involved in politics and dared not reveal their real names, so they competed to "hide," creating an unprecedented era of pen names in the literary world. However, an opposition party jumped out from another direction. They were very indignant, saying that people who used pen names were not brave and were hiding to shoot arrows in the dark. This time, the enemies of pen names were completely different from the previous ones. They were actually trying to find criminals in the legal sense. Because the writers were unwilling to come forward, they could not designate them, so they were so angry that they jumped and scolded. But the main effect was still a "challenge," trying to get the writers to write their real names in anger. But in the end, they did not achieve their goal, so they became even more determined to judge the writers who used pen names as "insidious people," as if they were the most frank. But of course, it is no wonder that they were self-righteous, because most of their articles were indeed written under their real names.

Although the anti-pen name theorists in these two periods had completely different stances, their surface arguments were roughly the same, both calling on the writers who used pen names to "come out."

Let's look at this matter from the perspective of the brain. Although the anti-pen name movement in the first period seemed a bit vigorous, it was actually very simple. The opponents at that time were a bit stupid and had no other effect at all. They were simply opposed to pen names for the sake of opposing pen names. In the second period, however, the nature of the movement became complicated, and the opponents were also clever characters. Their real purpose was not to ban pen names, but to ban the people who used pen names. This was much more practical than in the first period.

### Every Bullet Has a Harvest

— Fang Li

### Returning Home

— Lu Ting

Although it was early morning, Li Jie's spirits were very poor. His head was empty, and his eyes felt a little dry and painful. Last night, on the hot military cot, he tossed and turned, always thinking about the same question: "To go or not to go?" And so, until the pitch-black room turned gray, - dawn quietly came to the world again.

With his hair disheveled, sitting on the military cot, hanging his head, Li Jie was again bitterly thinking about the question of "to go or not to go." Suddenly, a burst of floorboard sounds rang out, and his younger brother ran into the room, jumping and bounding, threw a Shen Bao onto his older brother's lap, and then ran out of the room, jumping and bounding.

He sighed slightly and unconsciously opened the Shen Bao. He turned the pages one by one. Although his eyes were looking at the newspaper, he didn't see anything. Suddenly, his hand stopped turning the pages, and his eyes were fixed on a large headline: "Under the Persistence of Hoarders, the Rice Market Situation is Serious," and two smaller headlines: "Smaller Rice Shops Will Have No Rice to Sell, Closure Will Affect Public Order," and below, an even smaller headline: "Requesting Police Protection for Rice Shops."

Frowning, he subconsciously turned the page again, "Second Anniversary of the Shanghai War Today, the Concession is Taking Stricter Precautions"...... but he didn't read on. Suddenly, a scene from the outbreak of the Shanghai War two years ago appeared before his eyes: a long line of people, anxiously waiting in front of a rice shop with only one window hole open. "A Line of Hungry People"! ......

His mother came into the room, muttering to herself: "Coal briquettes are 3.40 yuan a dan, raw oil is 5.80 yuan a jin, alas, these days, this......

He didn't raise his head, and his eyes were fixed on the newspaper again. Suddenly, he heard his mother's words in his ears: "Jie, what does the newspaper say?"

He still didn't raise his head. Thinking of his mother's love for him and his father's hard work, going out early and returning late, earning money to support this so-called family, his heart couldn't help but feel a burst of bitterness. He blamed himself again:

"You don't have a job, so what reason do you have to stay in Shanghai? Is holding a small group meeting with three or four friends once a week the only reason to stay in Shanghai? Shanghai, the long-awaited paradise, is now filled with five million people; all the pleasures, as long as you have money, you can get them! Shanghai, is truly an adventurer's paradise! ...... Alas, although you don't have money, you don't want to leave Shanghai!

He suddenly raised his head, tears flowing from his eyes: The land of the motherland is calling you! Like thunder, this sound shook his heart.

Yes, let me decide like this! I can't deceive myself anymore! I must throw myself into the arms of the motherland! I want to return to my hometown, where there are a hundred times more practical and a hundred times more important than a small group meeting once a week.

There is work waiting for me to do!

Standing up from the military cot, his tall and strong body, caressed by the cool morning air, his heart felt inexplicably pleasant.

### Distant Place

— Gu Ding

I miss the distant place, I yearn for the distant place, to think of the distant and vague distant place, it is a long-lasting taste that surges into my heart.

I often have a wonderful ideal, to leave footprints all over the world. Or rather, I want to move thousands of times, so that my thoughts dissolve into fragments, scattered in every corner of the earth. The branches in spring, the clouds in summer, the evening breeze in autumn, the morning light in winter, all linger with a me, a shadow of someone who yearns for the distant place.

Enjoyment is a kind of luxury, hardship is a kind of training. If the shape of training is stained with luxury, it is a kind of art. So I often think like this: enjoy it, but don't forget that luxury is superfluous! For example, the people in the distant place, the scenery in the distant place, the wind in the distant place, the sunlight in the distant place, have once given me a period of meditation, but the edge of the meditation is engraved with the marks of enjoyment. When I shrink my gaze and carefully concentrate on the near, I immediately see molten gold and flowing fire, refining the prison of sin. What is this? Could it be that close contact is enough to be called sharpening and training? I am at a loss, and in the midst of being at a loss, I think again of the people in the distant place, the scenery in the distant place, the wind in the distant place, the sunlight in the distant place.

Not only the difference in region, but also the length of time will create a series of distant places. The memories of childhood, all the way to the future predictions, how far apart are they? Time is a ghost, and the dust of the world is also a ghost, which will drag people from the beginning of life to the end of life. Although it is a journey, it can be seen to the end and walked to the end, unlike the vague distant place, which does not know where it is located.

The weeds in the cemetery, the cold wind, the blue moon, the adorned scenery, are really the closest of close places. The living yearn for the distant horizon, but the dead only have to accompany the stone tablet. Take a journey, turn your head, the trees by the roadside are all dying, how can they withstand the retention of thought! A journey, a journey passed, only the yearning for the distant place is the mark of eternal life. Don't bow your head and ponder, those are all signs of the weak. The past is a distant place, a piece of history, carried on the shoulders of memory, is a clear mirror, which can reflect our faces. The future is a distant place, a vast world, full of evil fruits, covered with the veil of emptiness, only our hands can take on the work of development. The present, too, is a distant place, a lingering attachment to the distant place, a yearning for the distant place.

It is said that a person should focus on the "distant place" and start with the near place. Then, let's stand on the high ground and gaze far away! See a little spark, a row of fortresses, a faint lamp, a black shadow, hidden in the middle there is also our future life, our future soul.

The road has not yet been opened up, the lamp has not yet been lit, but our steps are heading towards the distant place. The journey in my meditation should be a road of light? Today there is a ship raising anchor, let's send a letter to a friend in the distant place first, thinking that everyone is well.

### Creating a Free City

— Jin Ye

The wheel of history,

Is advancing

Like flying.

Who will allow me to admit,

That in these years, we

Have been constantly growing.

An eye for an eye,

A tooth for a tooth,

We are now implementing.

For the eternal existence of the nation,

We have further corrected life.

Bearing the misfortunes of the past,

Cleansing them in reality.

Continuing to change the environment,

To create a free city.

### Memories are Toxins

— Chen Weihua

You are tormented by memories - or some are sweet, but the few sweets only arouse more pain. It winds around you like a venomous snake; making you drowsy and closing your eyes to gnaw, imagining the vast wilderness, dreaming......

As a result, what you are pinching is a bunch of painful sparks, what you are grabbing is a piece of angry soldering iron; it burns you, and you feel pain in your heart and lungs. So you fall asleep, laboriously; anger and pain immediately drill into the marrow of your bones! So you sigh again, you cry again... is this the gratitude of a life in bitter boots? Apart from that, by what right do we still have the right to cry?!

You deserve sympathy, but this sympathy is no different from what we bestow upon the crippled beggars, are you willing to accept this sympathy? If you are willing, then you are shameless, you should be despised by the soldiers and abandoned by the times!

You say that although memories mercilessly attack you, they also unceremoniously warn you. For this, you thank memories. But these thanks are so many, and so worthless. I doubt the warning of memories and its responsive thanks; I doubt even more what beneficial things they have made you do.

Here is the answer: memories have not made you alert to face the real reality, they have dug out your eyes that dare to face and can see deeply; they only make you obsessed with the beautiful, but dead past. Nor has it established your strong will, it is only like an endless water pipe, constantly weakening the flames of your youth.

You become haggard, you become cowardly, you wander, you complain, you become decadent...

We cannot allow, and you yourself should not, let memories erode your life like this, because this life does not belong to the individual, but to our motherland.

Memories are toxins. Curse them, destroy them, let the battle of reality drive them away! Friends, you should know that our compatriots are still waiting for us to rescue, and the freedom of the motherland is still waiting for us to fight for, in every corner of the motherland.

### Five-Color Wireless Telephotography

— De Gang

Since Mr. M. J. L. Baird of England invented wireless telephotography in 1925, scientists have flocked to research it, gradually advancing this nascent scientific invention towards maturity. Recently, this pioneer of wireless telephotography has made another great invention, bringing even more significant progress to wireless telephotography. This is the successful experiment of five-color wireless telephotography. In the past two weeks, Mr. Baird publicly demonstrated in his laboratory, and the results were exceptionally satisfactory. The following is the situation of the experiment at that time:

A wireless telephotography machine was placed against the wall, with a square-meter white paper screen stretched in front. The audience sat four or five meters away from the screen. After the machine button was turned on, a beautiful five-color portrait of the King of England appeared on the screen, followed by the British flag, and then several scenes of famous scenic spots. Finally, there was a short five-color cartoon. Each color was very clear, especially red and blue, which were bright and wonderful, no less beautiful than watching a five-color sound movie.

According to Mr. Baird, his invention of five-color wireless telephotography is based on the radiation of cathode ray tubes. Therefore, he said, if cathode ray tubes are applied to current five-color movies, they will certainly be effective, thus reducing many bulky and unnecessary machines. Wireless telephotography has many similar relationships with movies, so the progress of wireless telephotography is also the progress of movies. Finally, there is one thing that Mr. Baird is not satisfied with, that is, the telephotography is only effective within three kilometers. Beyond three kilometers, the image and color become blurred. Therefore, he plans to continue his research to enable this five-color wireless telephotography to be broadcast from London to any corner of the world, so that it can be called a complete success.

### The Advancing China Film Studio

— Hui Cun

- New Films Are Being Made as Usual Despite Japanese Bombing

Since moving from Hankou to Chongqing, the China Film Studio has greatly expanded, built new factory buildings, adjusted its organization, gathered talent, and actively strived to produce national defense films. The first production after moving to Chongqing was the sound film "Protect Our Homeland," written and directed by He Feiguang and starring Ying Yin, a rural national salvation education film. The film was completed in mid-June and was screened at the only theater in Chongqing last month. It sold out for ten days, and the situation was unprecedented.

Following "Protect Our Homeland," the film currently in production is "Good Husband," written and directed by Shi Dongshan. The female lead is Shu Xiuwen, and her current husband, Wang Shizhen, is the cinematographer. Currently, they are rushing to shoot on location, and it will be completed by the end of this month, and will be screened in Chongqing in early next month.

Films in preparation include "Childhood China," written by Yang Hansheng and directed by Shi Dongshan; "Women's Army," written by Sun Shiyi and directed by Yuan Congmei; "Anti-Japanese War March," written by Tang Yu and co-directed by Ying Yunwei and others; "Long Live China," directed by Shi Dongshan (the play has been performed on stage); "Descendants of Gods," written and directed by Yuan Congmei; and "The Northern Frontier Winds," written and directed by He Feiguang, totaling more than ten films.

In addition to actively producing national defense feature films, the studio also dispatched photography teams to various battlefields and behind Japanese lines to take real-time shots of the heroic posture of our soldiers and the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in the rear. Newsreels of this kind are included in the "Anti-Japanese War Special," which has been filmed in six installments and has been shown in various places. Recently, the factory sent personnel to southern China for filming.

In addition, the studio also produces "News Extra" and "Song Collection". There are currently forty-six issues of "News Extra", including "Chinese Air Force's Long Expedition to Tokyo" and "Japanese Bombing of Chongqing", which are completely real-time shots and are indeed very precious. As for the "Song Collection", there are already two kinds, "Anti-Japanese War Song Collection" and "May Commemoration". The films include cartoons by the Wan brothers and singing by Sheng Jialun. Although these are very short, the meaning and interest are very profound and rich.

Last month, Japanese planes continuously attacked Chongqing. In one bombing, the newly built factory buildings of "China Made" were completely destroyed. The factory director Zheng Yongzhi was scratched by shrapnel, and the director of drama affairs, Zhou Boxun, was slightly more seriously injured and is still in the hospital for treatment. In addition, several guards were sacrificed. The damage to the entire mechanism of "China Made" was not an obstacle. Although Japanese planes still come from time to time, the filming work continues unabated.

### Small Preface to the Ankang Gathering (3)

— Tian Xu Wo Sheng

The use of the Heqin in Ankang is actually for adjustment to create the sound of peace. However, the sounds of the Taiwan Huang and Ankang are also different in pitch. That is, the main tone of the strings used by the Zhengshi Society today. If a piano is used to match its "Shang" character, it is I in the key of B, not like the "Shang" character of Taiwan Huang, which must use I in the key of C as the standard, because their pitches differ by a character. If there is no semitone of the black key. It is used as the leaf of the "Shang" character, then its upper and lower keys. Both cannot harmonize with it, so the semitone is called a "Qiliang" (riding beam), which also matches the name of the black key. According to this to prove Ji Kang's "Yuan Sheng Lun", it is also sufficient to see the image of a quiet body and a peaceful mind. Only a player of the Heqin can be like this. The current Shanghai Sutan is transformed from Taiwan Huang and can be matched with Sheng and Di. Its sound is high and the voice is hurried, which is completely different from Ankang's matching of Zheng and Xiao. The examples of Dongxiao and Di are the same as that of Zhi, singing high and low. The tunes played at the opening, with sound but no words, are "Si He" for both Ankang and Taiwan Huang, not the "San Liu" of Su and Taiwan. "Liu" is the high note of "He". The difference between "San" and "Si" is based on the Xiaogong tone, and the order of the seven tones of Fan, Gong, Chi, Shang, Yi, Si, and He is followed. The order of the six-character tone is three. Therefore, it is called "San Liu." The order of the four-character tone is four. Therefore, it is called "Si He." The sounds of Suzhou and Hangzhou are different. The people of Suzhou use the third hole of the Xiaogong tone of the flute, the "Gong" character, as "Shang", that is, the second harmony is based on the four "Gong" characters, which is one note higher than the Hangzhou people's use of the four "Gong" characters of the Xiaogong tone as "Gong". It is a change of Taiwan Huang, not the correct Ankang. The world likes to attach themselves to elegance. Therefore, they regard San Liu as San Nong, saying that it is the remnant sound of "Three Variations of Plum Blossoms", but they do not know that its rhythm is completely different from "Three Variations of Plum Blossoms", and it is actually an incomplete Si He. Moreover, it is the same for four sections and the same coda. Each section only changes its head. However, the main part is still Liu Shang, but under the repeated use of Liu Shang, it turns into Liu Shang Yi Chi Gong, Gong Wu Liu Fan Gong, and it has fallen into Yi Fan, which is a combination of north and south, not a pure southern melody.

### Recent Records of Silver Stars (Part 2)

— Yin Si

Chen Yunshang Will Temporarily Film Four Movies
Chen Yunshang has come to Shanghai again, and her new film, "One Night Queen," has recently begun filming. Chen is looking for a good residence, but it is not easy to find, and she is still staying at the "Paramount" hotel, accompanied by her mother and two maids. It is said that she is scheduled to film four movies this time, and will stay in Shanghai for half a year. By then, after filming all the movies, she will have to return to Hong Kong, because Hong Kong also has old friendships, and she has to film several movies there. The rooms at "Paramount" are quite spacious and very quiet. The interior is well furnished, with beds arranged side by side, each occupied by her and her mother. Therefore, it is very suitable to live here, and it is said that she may stay here for a long time and may not want to rent another house.

Diao Banhua is Resting to Give Birth
Diao Banhua belongs to Yihua Company and recently played the role of Princess Daizhan in the play "Wang Baochuan". Because she is pregnant, her abdomen is growing day by day. The director specially arranged to finish all her scenes in advance. Recently, she has been absent from the film studio for a long time, and spends her days quietly in her boudoir, resting to give birth. Although the expected date of delivery is still far away, because she has always been fond of beauty, she does not want to show herself in a clumsy state.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Newly Built Theaters Have Superstitions About Opening and Breaking the Stage

The superstitions of the old actors were really too deep, and there were too many facts that could be cited. For example, as I said before about building a stage, the stage must never face east, so as not to offend the taboo of the White Tiger. This is an internal matter. As for the direction of the theater's main gate, it seems that there is not much problem, but the shop facing the main gate must never be a pharmacy, because the Medicine King Bodhisattva is at the head, and the main actors often have difficulties and suffering, and the business of the theater will also be badly affected. Let's not talk about other places that have such a situation, let's take the Tianchan Stage on Fourth Malu in this city as an example. That location is very suitable, the architecture is also very grand, and it is located in a prosperous commercial area. In theory, the business should be better than other theaters, so as not to disappoint the expectations of the initial creators. However, since the original "Daxin" stage, it has been renamed "Shanghai" and "Tianchan" many times, but it has never been very prosperous. The famous old actor Li Jiri was even booed off the stage three times by people on that stage. (That day was a joint performance of Fishing and Killing Family by Jiri and Wang Yunfang.) Later, Wang Shaolou and Du Liyun sang "Famen Temple" together, just at the time of the big trial. Wang and Du knelt on the stage, and suddenly a person fell from the skylight, almost crushing the two to death. Such things are rarely heard of in peacetime. But they were all discovered in that stage. The only time the business was very prosperous was when Mei Lanfang performed on that stage. It is said that it was someone's borrowing the stage to perform. (The owner of the first stage of Danggui, Mr. Chang.) If not, why was it that when the same Mei Dawang went to perform at Tianchan twice last year, the business was very miserable? (Eight Eight)
