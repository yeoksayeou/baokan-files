(Chongqing) According to news received here, the Chinese army's counter-offensive in Hubei has been successful. Zhongxiang, located 180 kilometers northwest of Hankou on the east bank of the Hanshui River, has been completely surrounded by Chinese troops. After fierce bloody battles in the suburbs, Chinese troops broke through the Japanese defense line, occupied the docks, and the Japanese retreated into the city, tightly closing the city gates and holding fast. The Chinese army first launched a heavy artillery bombardment, and then this morning stormed through the city gates, leading to intense street fighting. (4th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Sihui: The fighting in the vicinity of Xinhui County seat took an abrupt turn for the worse on the afternoon of the 3rd. Chinese troops repeatedly charged and killed many Japanese soldiers. However, due to rapid Japanese reinforcements, the defending troops of the city were heavily surrounded. On the afternoon of the 3rd, Japanese plainclothes troops rushed into the city. After fierce street fighting with Chinese troops, they withdrew to the suburbs. Xinhui County seat then fell into Japanese hands. Chinese reinforcements are now heading to [illegible] and [illegible] areas, occupying strategic positions and fortifying defenses. (4th Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) The focus of the war remains in southern China and northern Jiangxi. Japanese troops are still urgently invading southward in Jiangxi. Approximately two Japanese regiments invading Gao'an are in a bloody battle with Chinese troops along the line of Shilidui, Qilishang, and Taojiazhuang near the north of the city. Japanese troops advancing toward Jinxian were blocked by Chinese troops in the mountainous areas northwest of the county. Chinese armies continue to advance, and will attack the Japanese on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line. The number of Japanese warships in eastern Zhejiang has increased, posing a threat of invading to coordinate with Japanese troops in northern Jiangxi. Chinese authorities have ordered strict defense. (4th Morning Dispatch)

Xiushui: After suffering setbacks from their western advance, the Japanese troops occupying Wuning are now mostly moving south towards Dongkou and Luoping. They may connect with the Japanese troops in Jing'an and Anyi. Chinese troops in the western suburbs of Wuning also frequently launch counterattacks against the Japanese troops in Wuning from an overlooking position. (4th Dispatch)

Wengyuan: On the evening of the 1st, Japanese troops continuing their advance toward Xinhui launched a fierce attack on Chinese troops in the Douniushan area (approximately 4 kilometers northeast of Xinhui City). After several charges by Chinese troops, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. Chinese troops are currently holding their original positions. (4th Dispatch)

Wengyuan: After several strong resistance efforts by Chinese troops, the Japanese troops in Shaping suffered hundreds of casualties. On the 1st, they received reinforcements of over 1,000 men and are now facing off against Chinese troops in the Jingangxu area. (4th Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese dispatches, Chinese and Japanese troops in northwestern Jiangxi Province are currently fighting on the north bank of the Jin River (which flows east into the Gan River) west of Gao'an. Japanese troops have occupied the positions surrounding Jing'an, Fengxin, and Anyi. Chinese troops have built trenches in the mountains west of these locations to hold them. Furthermore, Chinese troops on the west bank of the Hanshui River in central Hubei, opposite Zhongxiang, crossed the river on April 2nd. That evening, the vanguard of the Chinese army arrived at Ximatou outside Zhongxiang. The Chinese army has now surrounded Zhongxiang. (4th Reuters Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Although Japanese sources here claim that Japanese troops have entered Gao'an, according to neutral sources here, the fighting is still taking place 50 kilometers southwest of Nanchang. The claim that Japanese troops have invaded Gao'an is exaggerated. Furthermore, according to reliable information obtained by neutral sources, a large number of Chinese reinforcements recently arrived from Yuanzhou (Yichun) via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, sufficient to curb any attempted advances by the Japanese. It is also heard that in the Hengyang area of Hunan, Chinese forces have a significant number of troops stationed to prevent Japanese troops from infiltrating central Hunan. (4th Express News Agency Dispatch)

(Chongqing) He Guoguang, Director of the Chengdu Executive Headquarters, gave a detailed account of the current war situation during an expanded memorial week yesterday. He stated that the Japanese army's attempt to invade Yisha in central Hubei had failed. The battles of Nanchang and Wuning were fierce, and the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses. The Japanese army was intimidated by the brave resistance spirit of the Chinese army. When the Japanese army invaded a certain area of Wuning, they fiercely bombarded the Chinese army's positions with airplanes and artillery. The brave soldiers of the Chinese army fought valiantly in blood, never retreating even slightly. When the Japanese army charged into the Chinese army's position, one remaining soldier single-handedly killed dozens of Japanese soldiers with a blade before sacrificing himself. The current Japanese situation is dire, relying only on frequent troop movements (a show of force, but in reality without any ability to invade). The fall of Nanchang is irrelevant to the overall war situation. Chinese troops are now severely attacking Japanese troops in more advantageous areas. (4th Express News Agency Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops invading Xinhui have been repelled by Chinese troops. The Japanese troops in the Shaping area have also retreated to Jiujiang. (4th Express News Agency Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese military sources, the war in Jiangxi Province is still centered on the Xiang-Gan Highway. The Japanese army is currently concentrating its main force, advancing southwest along this road, attempting to attack Pingxiang, an important location in western Jiangxi, and then to spy on Hengyang in the west, in order to cut off the retreat route of the Chinese army in the northern section of the Yue-Han Railway. After five days of fierce fighting, Chinese troops in Gao'an have shifted to new positions to continue resisting. The fighting has now moved to the mountainous areas southwest and northwest of Gao'an. The Japanese troops invading south along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Nanchang are still being contained by Chinese troops in Yangjiazhen, northwest of Jinxian. Yesterday, the fighting there was quite intense. In the Xiushui area, there have been no changes to either side's positions. Although the Japanese army has occupied Wuning, most of the surrounding high ground is still under Chinese army control, so the Japanese army has not dared to advance west rashly.

Editorial

### A New Era in International Diplomacy?

British Prime Minister Chamberlain has recently exhausted himself in the situation in Eastern Europe, with much fanfare. On the afternoon of the 3rd, during his speech in the House of Commons, he was quite proud that he had opened a new era in British diplomacy. The various parties in his country, both in and out of power, as well as politicians and journalists in its democratic allies, also unanimously praised it as the beginning of a new era. However, can it be considered a new era without feeling ashamed? We sincerely wish the old man success, and would like to say a word for the further advancement of the new era.

The term "diplomacy" has its normal meaning and solemn interpretation. A country does not allow diplomacy to be insulted or despised; it is a major policy of national international standing. However, due to objective confusion with abnormal states and subjective entry into detours, it has long deviated from its original purpose and lost its original appearance. For example, it is said that "diplomatic rhetoric" should be the most grand, accurate, sincere, and passionate language and text to obtain the highest trust. However, today's people almost universally regard diplomatic rhetoric as deceptive and evasive language to shirk responsibility. Those who hear it are confused and discard it, but also think that diplomatic rhetoric is inherently like this; those who speak it think that they are succeeding, that they are doing their best in rhetoric, and that since it is issued for diplomacy, it should be like this. For example, it is said that "diplomatic skills" should be acts that are reasonable, sensible, and timely, aiming to genuinely benefit both parties. However, today's people almost universally regard diplomatic skills as methods of deception and coercion, and tactics of mutual fraud. This is inherently due to dishonest intentions, but for the sake of diplomacy, fraud is not shunned; the other party is wary and only nominally yields temporarily. It is undeniable that it is a misunderstanding of diplomacy and a wrong turning if a country uses nothing but deceptive and evasive language, and mere nominal yielding, in its diplomacy. The historical facts of those who caused disaster to the people and overturned states as a result are too numerous to mention.

The birth of the League of Nations had the strong involvement of each member state; its intentions were very real, but its consequences were extremely poor. Its covenant was almost a historical document of international deception, and its organization was almost a grand compilation of international diplomatic scams. Those in control were either cowardly in the face of danger or fundamentally insincere; those who protected it, such as China, only obtained so-called moral comfort; those who relied on it, such as Abyssinia, were reduced to slavery and had no way to appeal. Since then, when the Spanish problem occurred, there was the seemingly righteous policy of non-intervention; under this method, one could avoid disaster, avert remaining calamities, make empty protests and sit idly by while intervention occurred, and endure deception and reluctantly compromise. When the Czech problem occurred, not only was the mutual assistance treaty deemed insufficient, but the Munich Agreement was even used to aid the abuser, acting as if nothing was happening and shamelessly so. Czech Republic was neither able to seek completeness through the mutual assistance treaty nor able to survive through the Munich Agreement. Those who perished passed away, and the merit of peace was praised in appeasement. There was no war in international Europe. What corresponds to this is diplomatic rhetoric; what holds it together is diplomatic skill.

When Germany destroyed the Czech Republic, public opinion was in an uproar. This was not out of love for the Czech Republic, but only out of fear that disaster would befall themselves; the sympathy of "when the rabbit dies, the fox grieves" enveloped Europe. Therefore, some argued that tolerance had reached its limit, appeasement had failed, and the aggressor's ambition was boundless, so that it was clearly revealed. Moralists suddenly understood, and politicians suddenly changed their plans. If this is indeed the case, then let us research it based on widely circulated news. All of the above is still deceptive talk. Has the initial setback of Britain's proposal for an anti-aggression declaration been forgotten? Poland refused to join. What could be done? Dissatisfied with the declaration's inability to escape the pitfalls of so-called "diplomatic rhetoric" and "diplomatic skills," it was, in other words, not a grand, accurate, sincere, and passionate language, but an untrustworthy action. In plain language, Britain had not fully realized the situation, had not changed its plans, and still issued unrestricted, ineffective empty words because it was unwilling to take responsibility. The British reply to Germany stated, "Germany's neighboring countries cannot forget that Germany has repeatedly broken its promises. Therefore, they must unite and resist aggression." In fact, this kind of blame for violent aggression in a convoluted logical way, at least until Britain proposed the anti-aggression declaration, could be completely used as a logical way to blame hypocritical diplomacy. With such diplomacy, is there any doubt that countless people and many countries have been sacrificed?

Now, Britain has abandoned its traditional policy, generously accepting restrictions, and giving Poland guarantees without end, and will guarantee Romania. But it is not only this; Chamberlain also said, "The restrictions accepted by Britain not only apply to a specific situation, but their goal is to curb any attempt to control the world by force." This is said so clearly, it seems that it is a new era. Sharing the beginning of this "new era" is the high-minded arguments of some people in Europe and America yesterday, whose meaning is that only this policy can stop war and preserve peace. Such pronouncements have their truth; the reason why aggression does not end is because concession is endless; looking back at the past, it is indeed so. But what must be understood is that a tough policy to curb aggression can be effective, but is not necessarily so; it is also effective but not necessarily effective in maintaining peace; because it is not necessarily effective, this new era should not be seen as sufficient to stop war and preserve peace. In other words, merely seeking to stop war and preserve peace is the "diplomatic rhetoric" and "diplomatic skills" that aggressor countries have long seen through, and therefore not worthy of the name "new era"! It is necessary to make the assumption that war is inevitable, and there must be the determination to use war to curb aggression, and the determination to build a permanent foundation for peace with war. Sweep away the stale diplomatic rhetoric and diplomatic skills, and make diplomacy a diplomacy of sincere action; then the new era will begin.

To complete this new era, in addition to Britain, France, and Poland, countries with long-standing unity of purpose, such as the United States and Soviet Russia, should generously cooperate and participate immediately; and in Britain, France, and Poland, it is especially necessary to use the utmost courage to be the backbone of the new era, even if they do not obtain the backing of other countries, they are determined to go. This would be the most glorious new era and the greatest achievement of mankind!

### Economic Experts Freely Express Monetary Theories: Counterfeit Currency Will Inevitably Fail; Legal Tender Will Surely Circulate Endlessly

(Chongqing) On February 11th of this year, Shanghai newspapers reported that the Japanese puppets were attempting to undermine legal tender. It was said that after the puppet "United Reserve Bank" in Peiping issued banknotes, in order to absorb legal tender and profit from foreign exchange, they forcibly restricted the circulation of legal tender in Peiping, Tianjin, and occupied urban areas on June 10th of the 27th year. Furthermore, on August 7th of the same year, they limited the circulation of banknotes with Tianjin place names from the Central Bank and Bank of Communications to 90% of their face value, and planned to change this to 60% starting from February 20th of this year, and to stop circulation altogether from March 10th. The reporter specifically inquired about this matter with an economic expert, who stated that counterfeit currency will inevitably fail, while our legal tender will surely circulate endlessly. The main points of his statement are recorded below: (1) Speaking first of the current financial market situation, the total amount of our legal tender circulating in the Peiping-Tianjin area, as of January 21st, was more than 320 million yuan. In order to stabilize its exchange rate, the government ordered the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to maintain it at the legal rate. Since the entry into the second phase of the war of resistance, most of it has remained in the hands of people in the embassy district of Peiping, the concession in Tianjin, and the people of the inland countryside. Despite repeated sabotage by the Japanese puppets, it still circulates smoothly as before. On the contrary, the Shanghai water rate has increased from 15 to 25 yuan per thousand yuan. Its remarkable credibility has only become more solid after eighteen months of resistance. Conversely, the banknotes issued by the puppet United Reserve Bank, even if forcibly circulated, have actually depreciated to 886 to 878. This is because our legal tender has a substantial reserve fund and adopts an extremely prudent issuance policy. Regarding international commercial payments, it can still maintain a balance. Fellow countrymen in North China treasure the legal tender they obtain from selling agricultural and industrial products as if it were a priceless treasure. Recently, the continued efforts of the United Kingdom and the United States to replenish our foreign exchange stabilization fund have further demonstrated that our legal tender already has the superior conditions for unobstructed circulation. However, this is not the case for counterfeit money. Whether it is the counterfeit currency of our legal tender widely produced, or the counterfeit currency issued by the puppet United Reserve Bank, it has long been spurned by informed people because it has no reserve fund to speak of and is issued through despicable means. Even if its use is forcibly imposed, its nature is no different from the enemy's military scrip or the enemy government's worthless inconvertible banknotes, which at most is only a kind of disruption to our country's financial market. The fact that the enemy country prohibits the inflow of counterfeit United Reserve Bank banknotes into its own country to avoid accelerating the crisis of malignant inflation in its market, and that our compatriots in North China also pay it out as soon as they receive it, while rejecting all counterfeit legal tender, can prove this. I personally hope that our compatriots in North China will uphold their fervent patriotism, not be intimidated by violence, and respond appropriately. They will surely cause great chaos in the financial market of North China occupied by the enemy and puppets. As a result, the enemy will be unable to prolong its dark and brutal crimes with harmful currency. (2) From the perspective of monetary theory, the banknotes of the puppet United Reserve Bank also have reasons why they cannot circulate. There is a saying in monetary science that inferior coins drive out good coins, which refers to the quantity theory of money. However, the relationship between currency and the credit system is of utmost importance in modern commercial economics. Counterfeit money is not a hard currency and cannot even be said to drive out our legal tender. This is because counterfeit money lacks a reserve fund and has no credit foundation. In the history of world currency, there is no currency that lacks credit and can exist for a long time. Since counterfeit money has no credit foundation, it does not have the qualifications for circulation. Today, the puppet regime only relies on violence to maintain the circulation of counterfeit currency, and its inevitable failure can be predicted. (3) Furthermore, from the perspective of monetary management talent, since the implementation of the new monetary policy, our country's currency system has entered a new era. The management of legal tender has been carefully planned by our financial authorities, so that it can be easily handled even during wartime. The high level of intelligence and competence of our financial authorities, such as the leaders of the Central Bank and the Bank of China, is incomparable to the financial figures under the control of the Japanese puppets. Since the outbreak of the sacred war of resistance, the various wartime measures taken by our financial authorities are worthy of praise, such as stabilizing finance, managing foreign exchange, and planning the financial institutions and economic organizations of the southwest and northwest. Among these, the recent efforts to support the position of our legal tender in North China and resist the circulation of counterfeit money are particularly meritorious. On the contrary, many of those on the enemy side who lack talent and moral character occupy important positions, are senile and immature, and lack understanding. After invading for a year, they still cannot fathom the power and growing prestige of our legal tender. Now they are still plotting to undermine our legal tender in North China, only showing their futile efforts. (4th Dispatch)

### Soviet Newspaper Discusses Sino-Japanese War: China Maintains Excellent Fighting Strength; Japanese Morale Declines Daily

(Moscow) The Red Star newspaper commented on the Sino-Japanese war, saying that the Japanese army's occupation of the Han River and areas near Nanchang is only of local significance and cannot affect the overall war situation. The plans of the Japanese warlords to exploit the occupied areas economically and launch further actions are largely built on sand. China's guerrilla movement is increasingly embracing the masses and poses a serious threat to such plans. The Japanese have failed to break the firm will of the Chinese army. The Chinese army is still able to maintain its excellent morale and fighting strength, and has the support of the anti-Japanese national united front, which is growing stronger and constantly resisting the Japanese occupying forces. The situation on the Japanese side is completely different. Anti-war sentiments have spread among their soldiers, and this sentiment has even infiltrated the ranks of officers. The increasing number of Japanese soldiers and officers killed for disobeying orders proves that turmoil has arisen within the supposedly "invincible" imperial army. The failure of the Japanese army's attempts to eliminate the guerrilla movement has further lowered the already low morale of the Japanese soldiers. The second front created throughout the occupied areas is demanding that the Japanese constantly increase their strength and military spending, causing the Japanese army's claims of victory to be completely in vain.

### Singapore Pays Attention to Air Defense

(Singapore) Singapore's preparations for civilian defense against aerial and naval attacks are well underway. The relationship between the Royal Air Force and the civilians is increasing, as the authorities have decided that civilians on the island of Singapore will not be allowed to move inland during wartime. Therefore, camps have been set up in the countryside to accommodate tens of thousands of Chinese and other Asians from densely populated areas. The cooperation between the Chinese and the authorities in arranging emergency preparations is progressing smoothly. Six air raid warning devices will soon arrive here and will be installed in police stations, fire brigades, and other important buildings. After these devices are installed, preparations for defending against aerial bombardment and naval shelling will be greatly improved. The experience gained from the recent two blackout exercises has shown that air raid alarms can be sounded suddenly without prior notification. This measure will serve as a real test of public discipline and preparedness for cooperation with the island's defense forces in dealing with emergencies. The sound of the alarm can be heard within a radius of about two miles. The devices will be distributed to key locations throughout the island so that they can be heard far and wide. Sandbags are being shipped from England every week. In addition, auxiliary fire brigades, police, and wounded personnel are also arriving one after another, with each batch numbering about 500 people. The equipment for the fire brigade is also being ordered, and its efficiency will be three times greater than the existing equipment. The training of air raid watchmen has also made great progress. According to Commander Jog of the Royal Air Force in Singapore, the aim is to train 2,000 watchmen. Since the opening in March, the number of applicants has reached 1,000, almost all of whom are British-Chinese. All Royal Air Force publicity materials are printed in Chinese, English, Malay, and Tamil so that all residents can read them. (4th Reuters Dispatch)

### British Government Leads the Organization of a European Anti-Aggression Alliance; Actively Wooing Various Countries to Participate in Mutual Protection of Independence; Urgently Seeking to Strengthen Romanian-Polish Relations

(London) The British government is currently working hard to organize an anti-aggression alliance, the nature of which is similar to the various divine alliances of the Napoleonic era. This can be confirmed by the declaration issued by Prime Minister Chamberlain today. The main significance of this anti-aggression alliance is to establish joint relations among the participating countries, to help each other protect independence. In addition to giving guarantees to Poland, Britain will give the same guarantees to Romania and will adjust the current alliance treaty between the two countries so that they can jointly resist aggression if either is attacked. Regarding this, although Poland does not want to be hostile to Hungary, Romania insists that if Hungary assists Germany in aggression, the mutual assistance clauses in the Romanian-Polish alliance treaty should also be applied. As for the Soviet Union, its position in the anti-aggression alliance should be (for participating countries other than military), in other words, it should supply other countries with raw materials and munitions but not send troops to assist. Therefore, the objections raised by Romania and Poland to the participation of the Soviet Union no longer exist. Recently, the British government has requested that Romania and Poland clearly state their positions, and the answers can be delivered in a short time by Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck and Romanian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Tilea respectively. Responsible persons here believe that in addition to Romania and Poland, Britain should also strive to persuade other countries that are determined to defend their national independence and sovereignty to join. The talks between the Director of the Eastern European Department of the Foreign Office, Zent, and the ministers of Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Greece on the 1st of this month are very important. Britain hopes that Bulgaria will join the Balkan Entente and establish an understanding with Romania and Turkey, so that the situation in the Balkan Peninsula can be stabilized. In the event of war in the future, Romania can send troops through the Black Sea and the Dardanelles to assist the countries of the Balkan Entente. In addition, the Scandinavian countries should also be asked to supply raw materials. Portugal already has an alliance treaty with Britain, which should be strengthened so that it can fully protect its colonies. As for Spain, it is generally believed that Britain can obtain its assistance by providing financial assistance to the Nationalist government. Prince Balm of the two royal families recently came to London and has had contact with the British authorities on the issue of loans. As for Italy, responsible persons here all believe that the country will not place Albania under protection to confront Britain. (3rd Vas Dispatch)

(Washington) Foreign policy authorities today believe that the new anti-aggression group led by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in Europe has avoided the possibility of a major war breaking out in Europe immediately. Senior US officials unanimously agree with Chamberlain's declaration on German aggression and how to deal with it. Many believe that Germany may make demands on the Polish border, but it is expected that it will be resolved through negotiations rather than the use of force. Britain's willingness to provide military assistance to countries about to be invaded is strongly believed here to bring Nazi aggressive behavior to a complete halt for the time being.

### Soviet Union Denies Promise to Aid Poland; Intending to Hint to Romania and Poland to Change Their Current Attitudes

(Moscow) The "Legal Gazette" and the "Shi Shi Bao" recently published a Moscow dispatch from Havas, stating that the Soviet Union promised to supply Poland with military materials in the event of war, and to close its markets and stop supplying raw materials to Germany. TASS is hereby ordered to state that the above news is inconsistent with the facts. The Soviet Union has not made such promises or assumed such obligations. (Scattered TASS Dispatch)

(Paris) The difficulty in forming a common front to resist aggression lies in Poland's disregard for the passage of Soviet troops through its territory. It is known that in the event of war in the future, they will only supply munitions and will not send troops to assist. There is no need to worry about this. Moscow issued a semi-official statement yesterday, stating that the Soviet Union has never promised to supply munitions to Poland or Romania. The intention is to hint to the two countries that cooperation with the Soviet Union is beneficial and that they must change their current attitudes, which is a sound strategy. (3rd Vas Dispatch)

### British and Polish Talks Proceeding; Negotiating a Mutual Assistance Treaty; The Scope of the Talks Also Involves Economics

(London) After Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck arrived here, he held talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax, Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office Meade, and Director of the Central European Department Sterling this morning for two hours. Not only did they have lunch together at the invitation of the Foreign Secretary at noon, but regarding Foreign Minister Beck's trip, Polish people here all believe that Colonel Beck has informed Foreign Secretary Halifax that since the British government has provided guarantees to Poland, Poland is also prepared to provide guarantees to Britain. The four items discussed were: (1) How to phrase the mutual treaty, (2) How to improve relations between Poland and Romania, (3) Britain providing loans to Poland, and (4) The issue of Jews in Poland. (4th Havas Dispatch)

(London) When Polish Foreign Minister Beck and his entourage arrived at Victoria Station today, people from all walks of life gathered at the station to give them a warm welcome. Besides discussing political events with British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Secretary Halifax, and others, Beck will also be involved in economic and commercial events. It is generally believed that the experts who came to London with Beck are here to discuss a possible economic agreement between the two countries. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)

(London) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck is scheduled to hold the first formal talks with the British authorities tomorrow morning. According to responsible sources, the main issues to be discussed tomorrow will be the mutual acceptance of commitments between Britain and Poland, the issue of Poland and Romania strengthening their military cooperation, and the territorial integrity of Romania, which has now become a matter of great concern to the British government. Since Poland is a major power in Central and Eastern Europe, it can accept greater commitments regarding the security of its neighbors with whom it has direct relations. (3rd Havas Dispatch)

### Albania Expresses Determination to Uphold Independence; Italy Prepared to Send Troops to Land in Albania; British-Italian Talks Related to This

Albanian Capital The government information office recently issued a notice stating that many newspapers, radio stations, and other sources have issued news, investigating the country that is placing Albania under protection, knowing that Albania's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity must not be allowed to be infringed upon by other countries. This news should be considered untrue. (4th Havas Dispatch)

(Paris) The Italian government has informed the Albanian government that it will send troops to land at the port of Vlorë in the country in a short time. This statement has been confirmed by many sources. Italy's move is based on the 1927 Italian-Albanian Treaty, which stipulates that if Albania is threatened by foreign countries, Italy will send troops to assist. Its troops will depart on the 6th or 7th of this month. The Albanian authorities held a meeting to declare their readiness to resist. The two sides are in negotiations to discuss ways to resolve the matter peacefully. (4th Havas Dispatch)

(Rome) Ten days ago, there were rumors that the Italian army was preparing to land in Albania, but officials denied it. Tonight, these rumors have resurfaced, and it is rumored that troop transports are moored in Bari and Brindisi, waiting for orders. 20,000 soldiers are concentrated in the area. Sources believe that Italy will not take any action without the full consent of King Zog of Albania. It is also rumored that Albania is now willing to be a semi-protectorate of Italy. At the same time that news of Italy's intentions in Albania resurfaced, the "Daily Telegraph" published an article criticizing Britain and France for plotting to place Greece and Albania next to Italy, intending to turn the two countries against Italy. The third country is Yugoslavia, but thanks to Mussolini's strength, the Adriatic Sea has been peaceful for many years. (3rd Reuters)

(Rome) Officials are unwilling to make any comment on rumors that Italy is about to send troops. Personnel from the Albanian Embassy flew back to their country. In addition, British Ambassador Payne visited both sides today. People on both sides remain silent. It is rumored that this move is related to the Italian plan to send troops to Albania.

### New Era in British Policy: Chamberlain's Resolute Declaration – Resist the Domination of the World by Force – Exert All Efforts to Avert War – Difficulties in Establishing Friendship with the Soviet Union Have Been Eliminated

(London) During the debate in the House of Commons today regarding foreign policy, Prime Minister Chamberlain, amidst cheers, declared, "The declaration I made last Friday represents a major shift in the actions previously undertaken by Britain and in Britain's traditional political views. This declaration is not related to border incidents but to the major issues underlying them. If Poland is threatened, I am sure the Polish people will resist. If that happens, this declaration means that Britain and France will immediately step forward to support Poland." (The audience cheered upon hearing this.) "I believe the British people are now united in supporting not only what I have just said but also the purposes and objectives implied in my words. I also believe that the entire British Empire shares this support. The various parts of the British Empire abroad have been watching our efforts for peace with the fervent hope that these efforts will be successful. Now, they all realize that Europe has been subjected to unexpected and alarming events in recent months. We cannot live in this atmosphere of surprise and panic for long, and our common lives cannot proceed in this state of instability. The government has, to the best of its ability, used clear language to restore trust. I know that in doing so, the government has truly expressed the will of the British people," he said. The Prime Minister, at the beginning of his speech, recalled Hitler's promises to Britain and the world during the crisis last September that Germany did not want to dominate other nations but only to bring Germans within the German-speaking region back into its territory. He said, "At that time, Hitler told us that once this was done, it would be the end. Germany had no ambition to acquire more territory. Unexpectedly, this promise has now been completely abandoned, and trust has been utterly destroyed. The British government has had no choice but to change its policy. We have also heard that Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia was justified by two reasons: one, historical ties, and two, fear of being attacked. This may sound reasonable, but how does it reconcile with the promises previously made? (The audience cheered.) Inevitably, they will have excuses when they expand their territory in the future. I am not saying that there is any provocation now. As far as I know, there has never been an official announcement of such ambitions. However, official discussions have been common. The impact of recent events has extended far beyond the countries directly involved, or even further than the consequences foreseen by those who caused these events.

Welcoming Cooperation with the Soviet Union Regardless of Political System

Referring to the talk of encircling Germany, the Prime Minister said it was absurd to describe a policy of self-defense as an aggressive policy of encirclement. "I do not wish to specify today which governments we will be consulting with now or in the future regarding the situation. However, I can now say something about the Soviet Union, because I am well aware that the Soviet Union is always in the minds of the opposition members, and I know that the opposition members still have some doubts as to whether the so-called ideological differences will prevent us from acting together in events where we have mutual interests. I do not deny the existence of ideological differences. These differences remain unchanged. However, we believe that regardless of ideological differences, they are truly insignificant in such major issues. What we emphasize now is the preservation of our independence. By 'our independence,' I mean the independence of all countries threatened by aggression. Therefore, we welcome cooperation from any country, regardless of its political or internal system. This is not for aggression but for resisting aggression."

Declaration of Commitment to Poland Must Be Implemented Effectively

The Prime Minister continued, "The result of today's debate will show the world that the House of Commons fundamentally agrees with the declaration made on Friday. The House will demonstrate its united and resolute spirit in adopting any necessary plans to ensure the declaration is implemented effectively. The declaration on Friday was indeed a new and great transformation in British foreign policy, and it added a commitment beyond the obligation of prudent regulations publicly announced by former Foreign Secretary Eden in his famous speech. The declaration on Friday was very clear and left no room for misunderstanding. It is not focused on the details of border incidents but on the major issues hidden behind them, namely the independence of Poland. If Poland's borders are threatened, the Polish people will rise up in resistance, and Britain and France will immediately come to Poland's aid. This is the meaning of the declaration on Friday." The Prime Minister also recounted his broadcast address to the nation on September 27 of last year, in which he said, "I am a man of peace. I regard international armed conflict as a devil. But if I knew that any country was determined to dominate the world by force, I would definitely think it necessary to resist it, because people who believe in freedom would find life unworthy of living under such domination." He said that he did not think Germany's demands on Czechoslovakia at the time necessarily meant Germany's intention to dominate, so he did not feel it was appropriate to ask the nation to accept new obligations. He later expressed his views on President Roosevelt's New Year's message, believing that if a country sought to dominate other countries, as President Roosevelt said, it must be resisted.

Hoping Germany Will Realize the Folly of War and Turn Swords into Ploughshares

The Prime Minister then explained to the House of Commons how Germany had broken the promises made by Hitler himself, destroying the world's trust and forcing the British government to change its attitude. He said, "Recent events have shocked the world. The entire British public feels the absolute necessity to clarify Britain's position. I say this reluctantly. I am not a warmonger. Today, as in September last year, I do not want to impose on the German people the treatment that the British people do not want. I had hoped that the commercial discussions that had begun in Germany would benefit both Britain and Germany and other countries, but trust has now been shaken and cannot be easily restored. If Germany is engaged in a plan to dominate the world by force, then the consequences will go beyond today. If the German government has no intention of seeking hegemony, then that is excellent, because if so, any agreement aimed at ensuring the independence of countries that are clearly threatened will not need to be implemented. I hope that our actions, which are just beginning and not ending, will not lead to a war that achieves nothing, adds nothing, and stops nowhere, but will lead to a turning point towards a new era where reason replaces force and theory replaces threats," he said.

### Foreign Secretary's Full Speech in the House of Lords

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax, speaking in the House of Lords today about the British government's guarantee to Poland, said, "After Hitler's speech on January 30, there seemed to be hope that no serious event would occur to shake Europe's trust. The British government was eager to cooperate with all countries, so Commerce Minister Stanley accepted the German government's invitation to go to Berlin to assist in commercial negotiations. Unexpectedly, Europe underwent another change, and this trip was cancelled. Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia – the importance of this action needs no explanation from me. The incorporation of eight million Czechs into Germany clearly contradicted the principles previously advocated by Hitler. Other countries neighboring Germany naturally felt that their national independence was also at risk, given Germany's actions. Therefore, the British government believed it was necessary to find a way to restore some trust in Europe, and it has been in contact with several other countries to this end. Negotiations are still in progress, and I am not yet able to make a final statement at this time. However, I can say that the British government is fully aware of the importance of the Soviet government's attitude and highly values the good relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. We must, of course, take into account the fact that some countries' relations with the Soviet Union are quite complicated. However, I can assure the House that, as far as the British government is concerned, these difficulties do not exist. As for the contact between the British and French governments, it has been very close throughout this difficult period. The two governments are in agreement on all issues, and the British government can always rely on France's full cooperation. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck arrived in London today, and I will have a frank discussion with him on many issues of common interest. Some say that Britain's actions towards Poland imply an encirclement of Germany. This is not the case. In fact, Germany's rise in the center of Europe is overwhelming. If its neighbors have doubts about Germany's intentions and want to take joint action for self-defense, this is a result of human nature and is certainly not caused by Britain's new policy of external pressure. Our contact with other countries does not stem from a spirit of hostility towards any country, but from our hope and belief that we can thereby consolidate stability and peace in Europe," he said. Labour Peer Lord Snell recounted the Labour Party's views on the situation, saying that the Labour Party agreed with the statements recently made by the government and welcomed the change in policy that had been shown. Liberal Peer Lord Crewe also spoke on behalf of the opposition Liberal Party, supporting the government's declaration. However, Lord Arnold expressed surprise at the opposition party's claim that this matter did not need to be debated, saying that history would see Britain's guarantee to Poland as the most unwise and dangerous decision ever made. The House of Lords then adjourned. (3rd, Reuters)

### Members of Parliament, Regardless of Party, Unanimously Support the Government

Opposition Leader Attlee was unable to attend due to illness, so Labour Deputy Leader Greenwood spoke on his behalf to begin the debate. Greenwood said he believed that before the House adjourned, it could show the world the united determination of the British people to cooperate with other countries in order to establish a strong and insurmountable barrier to resist continued aggression. The Labour Party supported the Prime Minister's declaration on Friday, and he hoped that the limited compromise expressed in the declaration would become a plan for mutual guarantees on a broader basis. The government, proceeding along this line, would certainly receive the assistance of the Labour Party. If it deviated from this work, it would be opposed by the Labour Party. He wished to state that the Labour Party was not a mere yes-man to a government of national unity. What the Labour Party cared about was principles and policies, which were more important than individuals.

Liberal Opposition Leader Sinclair then spoke, saying that he recognized that the provisional guarantee given to Poland was part of the current situation and was a necessary one. If he did not admit his mistake, the government's aim of ensuring victory in a possible war was not as assured as preventing the outbreak of war. There was no longer any dispute that Hitler aimed to control the entire world. Therefore, the only way to prevent war was to create an invincible resistance to aggression and to make it clear to Hitler and his generals that if they attacked any neighboring country, they would face war on two fronts. The British people certainly abhorred war, but when Hitler knew that the British government would avoid the final act of war, he could never successfully negotiate with him.

Conservative MP Churchill, speaking, ridiculed the view that British policy aimed to encircle Germany, saying that he often preached that if Germany was willing, it could also be given the same guarantee. If Hitler feared that the Soviet Union would ravage Germany, Poland would take the opportunity to attack, Belgium or the Netherlands would also strike, and Denmark might threaten to impose pressure, then he only needed to publicly announce his concerns so that he could obtain the most solemn international guarantees. Surprisingly, Britain, led by the Prime Minister, finally announced in clear terms and almost unanimously that the defense of Europe's freedom was a doctrine that Britain dared to undertake with all its strength. He was pleased to hear that the Prime Minister had dismissed the attempt to belittle the guarantee given to Poland. The government's attitude towards the Soviet Union had been carefully considered. The Soviet Union was a significant weight on the scales of world peace, and the Soviet Union was now deeply affected by German ambitions. Britain's initiation of resistance to aggression was a pioneering move. It was the first time that the leaders of the National Socialist Party saw the possibility of encountering war on two fronts. Opposition Liberal MP Lloyd George, speaking, sincerely congratulated the Prime Minister for returning to his policy from the last election, namely "not making cowardly concessions to aggressors," and said that the Prime Minister had opened a new page in the history of Great Britain and the history of the world's nations. Lloyd George also urgently said that it was imperative to win the sponsorship of the world's greatest military force, namely the Soviet Union. After discussing military strategy, Lloyd George added that if a dispute occurred between Poland and Germany, Britain would be powerless to help and must rely on the Soviet Union to come to Poland's aid.

Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Eden joined the discussion, expressing his views on the strategic considerations raised by Lloyd George, saying that half of the German troops would certainly be concentrated on the Polish border, but at least half would have to be stationed on the Western Front. Attacking on two fronts, while not impossible, would be extremely difficult. Compared to the situation in 1919, there was one important difference: Turkey and Egypt were now friends with Britain. Now that the Prime Minister had made the entire nation unanimously support the government's foreign policy, this was of great value when negotiating with other countries. The government could take comfort in the fact that Chamberlain's speech truly represented national sentiment. Today, it was best to organize everything and engage in preparations for war, he said. The entire House cheered upon hearing Eden's words. The proposal to organize a government of national unity on a broader basis was then withdrawn.

### Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon Concludes the Debate

Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, speaking last on behalf of the government to conclude the debate, said in brief that anything that could make Britain stronger and more united must be vigorously promoted. Now that Britain must devote its full strength to this vital task, all conveniences, comforts, wealth, or habits were not comparable to this necessity. When necessary, Britain would use this strength to resist aggression and fight against it. However, he felt that this effort laid a larger and more stable foundation for an organization that sought peace. If peace was achieved, it would be aided by the unanimity of the British House of Commons, he said. (3rd, Reuters)

### Berlin Resentment

(Berlin) There is much skepticism here about British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons today. A political commentator told a Reuters reporter, "What makes us suspicious is that the country he wants to help has not called for help, but only the country providing aid has issued this statement." The assurances issued by Britain that it did not want to threaten Germany were regarded here as a "platitude." A local newspaper commented, "Chamberlain is trying to use his umbrella as a Damocles' sword over Germany," implying that it was extremely dangerous. (3rd, Reuters)

### Moscow Announces the Course of Fisheries Agreement Negotiations – Japan Yields to the Soviet Union and Achieves Success

(Moscow) Regarding the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement signed on April 2, Soviet newspapers have recently published the full text of the protocol and the aide-mémoire from Litvinov to Japanese Ambassador Tamekame, along with a commentary from TASS on the event, the contents of which are as follows:

The Japanese fishing rights in Soviet territorial waters were obtained through the Treaty of Portsmouth. Until recently, they were regulated by the 1928 Fisheries Convention and the 1932 Supplementary Agreement. According to the convention, the Japanese were to acquire fishing grounds through auctions. According to the supplementary agreement, only new fishing grounds were to be auctioned, while old fishing grounds operated by the Japanese in the past were automatically leased to the Japanese based on lease agreements. The terms of the convention and supplementary agreement expired as early as December 1936. At the same time, the Japanese government also announced the cancellation of the convention, with the clear intention of obtaining greater benefits for its fishermen in the new convention. The negotiations for a new long-term fisheries convention, which began in 1936, did not yield results due to Japan's adoption of an extremely obvious anti-Soviet policy, especially manifested in the Japanese-German alliance under the guise of the Anti-Comintern Pact (therefore, the 1928 convention and supplementary agreement were extended twice in 1937 and 1938, each for one year).

In November 1938, the Japanese side proposed reopening negotiations for a new convention. The Soviet government responded that it must fulfill the guarantee of the payment conditions for the Chinese Eastern Railway in "Manchukuo" (to date, "Manchukuo" has not paid the final installment) before it would agree to hold such negotiations. Later, the Japanese government disregarded this condition, and the Soviet government agreed to negotiate only a temporary fisheries agreement for one year. In addition, the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs exchanged aide-mémoires and memoranda with the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union multiple times. The Soviet government declared from the beginning that it had decided to restore the auction system for both new fishing grounds and fishing grounds previously operated by the Japanese. Regarding other conditions, it was prepared to conclude a temporary agreement based on the 1928 convention, except that Article 8 of the convention, which stipulated that any fishing ground that had been opened could not be closed and must be auctioned or leased to the lessee without auction, could not continue to be valid. Regarding this point, the Soviet government announced its decision to reclaim 40 fishing grounds operated by the Japanese for military strategic reasons, including four attached to canning factories and one with a lease agreement that would not expire until 1941. Later, the Soviet government agreed to reduce the number of fishing grounds to be reclaimed to 37. In addition, the Soviet government also opposed the original convention's provision that allowed the Japanese to interfere with the Soviet state-owned fisheries' fishing quota, which was limited to 2 million poods.

The Japanese side firmly opposed the auction and demanded the automatic extension of all fishing ground leases, whether previously operated by the Japanese or expired. The Japanese side especially insisted on opposing the reclamation of 37 fishing grounds, putting forward unfounded reasons claiming that all the fishing grounds previously obtained by the Japanese were "stable" fishing grounds and must permanently be operated by the Japanese. The Japanese side also insisted that if the auction system was adopted, the fishing grounds operated by Soviet state-owned fisheries should also be auctioned equally. Subsequently, the Japanese side initially agreed to the reclamation of 12 fishing grounds and then increased it to 24, but demanded that they be replaced by the same number and equivalent value, and that the Japanese side should choose the replacement fishing grounds.

The Soviet government firmly rejected the principle of replacing or compensating fishing grounds reclaimed from the Japanese side for any reason. Regarding the above-mentioned disputed issues, the Japanese side's demands were based solely on the Treaty of Portsmouth. As had been repeatedly pointed out to the Japanese side, the treaty did not stipulate the procedure for leasing fishing grounds to the Japanese, the number of fishing grounds operated by the Japanese, the so-called "stability" of Japanese fishing grounds, or the restrictions on the Soviet Union due to the existence of fishing grounds. In addition, it was pointed out that the treaty had been violated by the Japanese side itself on multiple occasions. Due to its weak official position, the Japanese side repeatedly tried to invoke the corresponding articles in the Fisheries Convention and Supplementary Agreement, regardless of the fact that they had expired and were therefore no longer binding on the Soviet government. After the Japanese side had clearly agreed to accept the auction system and abandoned the so-called stability principle, the Soviet government also agreed to put nine additional fishing grounds of its own choice up for auction, allowing the Japanese to acquire them.

Accordingly, the two sides reached an agreement on the following terms:

First, the Japanese can only acquire fishing grounds whose lease agreements have expired through auctions.

Second, for military strategic reasons, 37 fishing grounds operated by the Japanese will be reclaimed, including four attached to canning factories. All such canning factories will also be closed.

Third, one of the 37 fishing grounds, because its lease agreement does not expire until 1941, will be replaced by another fishing ground granted by the Soviet government for the same term.

Fourth, the fishing grounds obtained by the Japanese through auction should have a five-year lease agreement in accordance with the 1928 convention. The Soviet government has never opposed this point.

Fifth, the fishing grounds attached to the canning factories set up by the Japanese, except for the above four, should be re-leased for another year without auction. The Soviet government has also never opposed this point.

Sixth, unlike the provisions of the 1928 convention, the Soviet government will henceforth determine the fishing quota for state-owned fisheries itself. The estimate for the 1929 fiscal year is 5 million poods.

Seventh, nine Soviet fishing grounds should be put up for auction in addition. Because the Japanese did not participate in the auction on March 15, the Soviet fisheries authorities auctioned off six of these nine, as well as four fishing grounds previously operated by the Japanese. Now, these agencies are willing to cede these fishing grounds to the Japanese.

Eighth, because the Japanese ambassador expressed concern that rental prices might be raised indefinitely in the auction, the Soviet Far East Fisheries Administration stated that it was not prepared to raise rental prices by more than 10%.

The most contentious issues in this negotiation were the restoration of the auction system, the reclamation of 37 fishing grounds operated by the Japanese, the correction of the false theory regarding the stability of Japanese fishing grounds, and the special status of Soviet state-owned fisheries in the Far East. Because all of these issues have been resolved, the Soviet government and people from all walks of life are completely satisfied with the agreement now signed. (3rd, TASS)

### British Newspaper Comments on Japanese-Soviet Relations

(London) The Manchester Guardian, in an editorial commenting on the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, stated that the Soviet Union has now completed a small but practical demonstration to show the world how to deal with aggressor nations. The Japanese government had been arrogant, boasting, and threatening, but Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov remained unmoved. How correct this attitude was has now been proven. Japan has now yielded, only needing the Soviet Union to agree to extend the old fisheries agreement for another year, in which case Japan is willing to pay an increased fee of one-tenth and lease a fishing area 27 less than last year. Litvinov was magnanimous and has promised. As for France, the opposite is true. Relying on "compromise," it now finds that it was a mistake. Hainan, which was once considered a French protectorate, has now been occupied by Japan. The New South Island, which was occupied by the French Navy in 1930 and formally declared occupied by the French government in 1933, has now also been annexed by Japan. Japan's actions thus demonstrate two trends in its policy: the southward advance eagerly sought by the Japanese naval community and the doctrine of aggression along the path of least resistance embraced by the general Japanese population, it said.

### Siam and Vietnam

This newspaper’s special dispatch: In the future world war, the only Far Eastern nation likely to be enticed by fascist aggressor countries is probably Siam. Due to the mutual constraints between the two strong powers, Britain and France, Siam's fate is better than its neighbors, Burma and Annam. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it remained a buffer state and did not suffer the pain of national subjugation. However, its territory has been partially ceded nine times. First, France occupied the provinces of Luang Prabang and Battambang. Second, in 1909, Britain seized Siam's Malay vassal states, namely the four small countries of Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu, and Perlis. This national humiliation is something Siam can never forget.

Moreover, among Siam's population of fifteen million, our overseas compatriots account for two and a half million. Besides fearing the partition by Britain and France, they also worry about the country's economic power falling into the hands of overseas Chinese. Therefore, Siam's position in Asia today is similar to Hungary's position in Europe. What it demands is to recover the lost territories since the previous century and gain true independence and autonomy.

This is Siam's legitimate demand, but unfortunately, Siam has not used legitimate revolutionary means to achieve its legitimate demands. In order to oppose imperialism, it has instead thrown itself into the embrace of imperialism. Since the September 18th Incident, Siam has been the only Asian country to openly express pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese sentiments. In 1933, when the League of Nations passed a resolution confirming Japan's actions, only Siam abstained. Overseas Chinese in Siam are constantly subjected to cruel treatment, and freedom of anti-Japanese speech and assembly is completely deprived.

They are both oppressed nations, so why should they exclude each other? This is not surprising, as Siam is still a semi-feudal and semi-colonial military dictatorship. It is inherently easy to embark on the path of fascism. Furthermore, because it wants to avenge and redress against Britain and France, it unconsciously fell into Japan's trap of aggression. In recent years, the Siamese military government has hired Japanese advisors, purchased Japanese weapons, and its politics are greatly influenced by Japan. Japan wants to lend money to Siam to dig the Kra Canal, so that Far Eastern ships can reach the Indian Ocean without passing through Singapore. If this project succeeds, it will undoubtedly cause serious damage to Britain's military and commercial position in the Far East. Although this plan has been temporarily shelved due to British opposition, it has not been completely abandoned. Since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Germany, Italy, and Japan, German forces have also infiltrated Siam. Recently, Germany has supplied Siam with a significant amount of weapons, which has further increased the unease of Britain and France. Although Siam does not currently have the possibility of joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, key government figures in Siam have repeatedly expressed sympathy for the governments of the Anti-Comintern bloc.

If Siam throws itself into the embrace of the fascist bloc, it will naturally threaten Britain's colonies in the Far East, but French Vietnam is in an even more dangerous position than British Burma. Because if Siam joins the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, it will first recover Luang Prabang and Battambang. In addition, the French protectorates of Laos and Tonkin are also the targets Siam wants to seize. This is because the two nations of Laos and Tonkin were conquered by Siam as early as the 16th century. After these territories are lost, most of Vietnam's territory will be gone. Coupled with Japan's offensive from Hainan Island, Vietnam will no longer be French Vietnam.

Japan's invasion of South China and occupation of Hainan Island have made France's Far Eastern colonies uneasy. In addition, since the last World War, Siam's military strength has been increasing day by day, and a conscription system has long been implemented in the country. In wartime, it can mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops. In recent years, Siam has also established a navy, ordering warships and submarines from Germany and Japan. The air force also has a considerable scale. Once wartime comes, it goes without saying that Vietnam is the most dangerous old friend on its back. Therefore, the relationship between Vietnam and Siam is the most worrying point for France regarding the security of its Far Eastern colonies.

Britain and France are dealing with Siam in the same way they deal with the Franco government in Spain, trying to use loans, trade, and various benefits as inducements, hoping to ease the conflict with Britain and France. As far as the relationship between France and Siam is concerned, there has been considerable success in recent months. The commercial treaty between Vietnam and Siam was signed several months ago and has now been approved by both the French and Siamese parliaments. Three months ago, France sent a military delegation to Bangkok for consultation. This time, the Vietnamese army and the large-scale military exercises near Lang Son, Siam also sent two officers to review the exercises. Currently, Siam and Vietnam maintain a good neighborly relationship on the surface, which is a reality. However, we know that aggressor countries will not stop their conspiracies to cause trouble for a moment. Once a European war breaks out and France's military strength in the Far East is weakened, no one can guarantee what the situation in southern Asia will become. In order to protect its interests in the Far East, what forces will France rely on? Isn't that already too clear?

### Outbreak of the Great War in South China: Japanese Troops Fiercely Attack Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and Heshui. The Prelude to the Great War on the West River Unveiled

Hong Kong correspondence: Taking advantage of the tense situation in Europe, the Japanese side mobilized a large army and launched a large-scale invasion in central Hubei and northern Jiangxi. Since the fall of Nanchang, the war in northern Hunan has also intensified. Their intention is nothing more than to attempt to attack Changsha and open up the Yuehan Railway to fulfill their ambition of aggression. However, at this time, the long-silent war in South China has also become increasingly tense. South China is located in the vanguard of central and southwest China. If the Japanese army wants to open up the Yuehan Railway, it must simultaneously launch an attack northward in South China. Therefore, recently, the Japanese army in Guangzhou has been conducting frequent exercises, and thousands of new soldiers have been transferred from the country, landing in Huangpu and Guangzhou, and successively reinforcing the West River. At the same time, construction projects are being carried out day and night in various places in the West River and northern Guangdong. By late March, the Japanese army in Guangzhou and Foshan began to attack Shunde Daliang to the south, pressing towards Zhongshan to the south, and eyeing the Siyi area to the west. On the morning of the 28th, the Japanese army in the West River and Siyi area suddenly launched an attack simultaneously, using the full force of its army, navy, and air force to fiercely attack the Chinese army. Their main force was obviously in the Sanshui area of the upper reaches of the Siyi West River. Although the Japanese army had increased by 3,000 and carried out frequent bombardments, because of the solidity of the Chinese defenders' positions, they did not dare to rashly attack. They had to avoid the strong and attack the weak, attacking Zhongshan from Shunde in the south, and at the same time coordinating naval forces to attack Jiangmen. For a time, the army, navy, and air force advanced simultaneously, and the intensity of the battle was unprecedented since the start of the war in South China. After fierce fighting until the evening of the 28th, Jiangmen was captured by the Japanese army, and the situation in Zhongshan was also very critical. However, by the evening of the 29th, Jiangmen was recaptured by the Chinese army. Currently, the war is extremely fierce in that area. Due to geographical reasons, the Chinese side does not have a strong garrison here, relying only on the People's Self-Defense Forces and security teams to fight to the death with the Japanese army. Therefore, the sacrifice is naturally expected. Another route of the Japanese army attacked Heshui from the west, coordinating with the artillery in Jiujiang and the ships on the West River to attack Gulao Haikou. The battle was very fierce. On the afternoon of the 28th, a part of the Japanese army had rushed into Haikou. At the same time, they advanced along the Jiujiang-Foshan highway to Gubu, threatening Heshui's new city. The two sides repeatedly charged and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and both suffered heavy casualties. Because the two armies were only a short distance apart, Japanese aircraft could no longer bomb, so the area was in a state of mixed warfare. Judging from this offensive by the Japanese army, their purpose is twofold: one is to consolidate the rear of Guangzhou, so they intend to occupy Zhongshan and Jiangmen, so that there will be no worries; the attack from Heshui is obviously threatening Gaoming and attacking Gaoyao (Zhaoqing) from the side. This is because the Chinese defenses in Zhaoqing are solid, the military strength is strong, and there is the danger of the Lingyang Gorge in front, making it impossible for the Japanese navy to operate. If they only attack with the army, the heavy casualties are bound to be expected, and it is difficult to win. Therefore, they used this roundabout tactic to try to attack Zhaoqing from the side or bypass the back of Zhaoqing. However, it is difficult to say whether the current purpose of the Japanese army's attack on South China is to penetrate deep into the West River, threaten Guangxi, and place the main force on that route. Weighing the situation, it is extremely difficult to attack the West River, and the timing to threaten Guangxi has not yet matured. If we look at the fact that the Japanese army in central China is currently actively besieging Changsha, it seems that the Japanese army in South China will also actively advance north along the Yuehan Railway, attacking from both sides, in order to capture central China as soon as possible, and then slowly plan Guangxi and threaten the southwest. According to this, the fierce fighting in the West River and Zhongshan area is just a trick by the Japanese to create a diversion. In the future, the main battlefield of the war in South China may be in northern Guangdong. According to news from two days ago, the Japanese army in Huaxian Xinjie is increasing day by day, and there is a pattern of advancing north. Therefore, the fierce battle in northern Guangdong may also break out soon. In summary, in the current stage of the Sino-Japanese War, the most intense areas are, in addition to Jiangxi and Hunan, South China. In fact, the wars in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong are interrelated. The Japanese army is strategically echoing each other from a distance, which is very obvious, and South China is of great importance to the overall situation.

### The Closing of the Chexin and Liangba Dams: The Accumulated Water in Various Counties in Northern Jiangsu Recedes Greatly; The Yellow River Water Upstream Has Been Cut Off, and Most of the Elevated Fields in Various Counties Have Dried Up

Taixian Communication: Although the Jiangsu Provincial Government is in a difficult environment, it is still urging the responsible personnel to direct and command tens of thousands of civilians to continue the project of dredging the accumulated water in Gaoyou, Binjiang, Xinghua, Taixian, Yancheng, and Funing counties. The breaches of the Chexin and Liangba Dams on the canal have been closed after three weeks of closure on the 27th and 28th of March respectively, and the embankment restoration project is now being rushed. The Yellow River water upstream has been cut off, and the Erzai Maoyou River, the waterway to the sea, has also been dredged one after another. A part of it has now been completed. In recent days, the accumulated water downstream has been greatly reduced. The river land in Dongtai and Gaobao counties has been divided, and most of the elevated fields have dried up. Farmers are busy with spring plowing. If the waterway to the sea project is fully completed, the accumulated water in various counties in northern Jiangsu will be completely dried up.

### Eight Counties in Northern Jiangsu Establish a Joint Defense Headquarters: Jin Zonghua and Others Take Command; The People of Huaihai Rise Up to Resist the War

Taixian Communication: The Jiangsu Provincial Government is now organizing a joint defense headquarters for eight counties including Huai'an, Baoying, Taixian, Gaoyou, Yancheng, Funing, Xinghua, and Dongtai, and has appointed commissioners Jin Zonghua and Chen Guiqing as the commander and deputy commander respectively. After Jin and others were appointed, they have announced their assumption of office.

The people in the Huaihai and Yancheng area have recently organized anti-war organizations in large numbers and are cooperating with the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong. They have destroyed the Zhenghai Highway and the eastern section of the Suihai Road in sections, making it impossible for the Japanese army to repair them, and their actions are extremely difficult. The Japanese army in Funing has recently burned many villages and towns in the surrounding countryside. The people are even more resentful of the Japanese army and are determined to never coexist with them.

He Xingzhen, which belongs to Funing County, has become a hub for commercial transportation in northern Jiangsu during the anti-Japanese war in northern Jiangsu. The waterway of Green Town can directly reach Shanghai. Since it was occupied by the Japanese army at the end of last year, commercial transportation has been greatly affected. According to reliable news, the Japanese army in the town withdrew completely on the morning of March 25, and the Japanese cavalry of forty or fifty people at Chenjiaqiao on the border of Funing and Lianshui also returned to Funing on the same day. On the way, they were attacked by the Chinese people, and dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed or injured.

### Shantou Citizens Engage in Evacuation; Wu Qijun Inspects Various Counties; Miao Peinan Plans a Counter-Offensive Military Operation

Shantou Communication: Large Japanese fleets often pass through the overseas area of Chaoshan. It has been raining continuously for days, and the military and civilians continue to deploy and drill in the field, without interruption due to the bad weather. Since the 24th, representatives from various national salvation organizations have been elected to go to Chao'an to hold a meeting to discuss the expansion of the spiritual mobilization and the national covenant oath movement. On the 25th, the people of Shantou evacuated to the inland in batches. Passenger traffic on land and water was particularly crowded. At that time, the war situation in northern Jiangxi had spread throughout Chaoshan. The people here are concerned about the war situation in Ganjiang and pay equal attention to the coast. At about 7:00 am on the 26th, three Japanese warships sailed from southern Fujian and anchored outside Mayu, stopping near Nan'ao. The number of large and small ships along the coast of Chaoshan suddenly increased to fifteen or sixteen. At about 8:00 am, four Japanese planes flew out of the Japanese warships and bombed the Shantou Railway Main Station. The Japanese planes flew low to less than a thousand feet and opened fire and strafed. Six bombs fell near the station. The entire ticket office collapsed and destroyed one passenger car and one locomotive. Dozens of holes were pierced in the carriages by machine gun bullets, and a certain Cao of the railway police was injured. Fortunately, the passengers had dispersed and the losses were not large. The plane flew to Chao'an and dropped bombs at Yixi Station, with the aim of destroying the North Causeway so that spring water would flood into the three counties of Chaojiepu, creating a second Yellow River flood. Fortunately, two bombs fell into the river, causing no damage to the North Causeway. At 11:00 am, a Japanese plane flew to Chaohui for reconnaissance without dropping bombs. At 2:00 pm, four Japanese planes flew to Jieyang and chased the Shanjie wheel Dahua, opening machine guns to shoot back and forth on the Guanbu River. Passengers jumped into the water to escape, killing eight people and injuring fifteen or sixteen people. They then went to Yixi and dropped eight bombs, opening fire to chase the train. The train stopped at Fuyang Station, destroying one car. The details of passenger losses are unknown. There are dozens of ships outside Shantou Port, and they seem to be spying on Raoping Chenghai. Japanese ships cruising overseas intercepted sailing ships. It is said that Nan'ao Houzhai Long'ao was re-occupied by the Japanese army after they landed. Due to the interruption of transportation, the truth is unknown. The Chaozhou-Shantou Railway tracks were blown off by dozens of feet and are being repaired.

The train service has been suspended.

Wu Qijun, the commander-in-chief of the Ninth Army Group, recently sent a large member to inspect the guerrillas in Dongjiang and ordered a general attack on Shilong, Zengcheng, and Dongguan. The war along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway will begin within ten days. Wu recently received an order from his superiors to concurrently serve as the director of the border area of the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. Wu inspected Shanghang, Wuping, Xunwu, Huichang, Pingyuan, and Xingning counties on the 24th, and established an office in the upper reaches of the Ganjiang River. On the 27th, he convened a meeting of the military, political, and party leaders of the three provinces to discuss the exchange of salt and rice between Guangdong and Jiangxi, the transportation and supply of food during wartime, the consolidation of local security, and the expansion of military-civilian cooperation. The meeting place was in Xingning and will be completed at the end of the month. Miao Peinan, the deputy commander of the Ninth Army Group, is stationed in Heyuan to preside over the counter-offensive military operations. Chi Zhongkuan has been appointed as the commander of the south bank of the Dongjiang River, and Zhang Ruigui as the commander of the north bank. The troops of Luo Fengxiang, Luo Kun, Liang Zhu, Wang Ruozhou, Zhang Wodong, Yuan Huazhao, and Liu Fayu have been inspected and are waiting for orders in the designated areas.

### "Central China Company" Monopolizes the Silk Industry; Zhenyi Factory is Destroyed

Wuxi Communication: Wuxi is a famous factory area in China. In its heyday, there were more than 60 silk spinning mills in the county. After the fall, all the factories were seized by the Japanese army. The Japanese company "Central China Company" invested 8 million yuan, and cooperated with local ruffians Zhang Zizhen and Qian Fenghao for expenses. Chinese capital accounted for 49%, and the Central China Company accounted for 91%. In fact, all personnel and equipment were controlled by Japanese businessmen. It is estimated that in the one year of the 27th year, a profit of 2 million yuan was made, and the entire county's silk industry was monopolized. At present, ten companies including Zhenyi, Hefeng, and Dingchang have started construction and are all controlled by the Central China Company. The county magistrate of the county and the 3rd Battalion of the 10th Detachment of the Zhongyi National Salvation Army and the Wuxi West District Joint Defense Force learned of the situation and decided to destroy the largest silk factories such as Zhenyi. The situation of each slightly recorded in the previous report, it is known that at 7:30 pm on March 23, more than 300 troops from Zhou Hanliang and Hu Shaomei of the West District troops gathered at Huishan Town and attacked the Japanese army in Wuqiao. At that time, there were more than 400 Japanese troops stationed in Lixin Cloth Factory and the Educational College, and they all came out upon hearing the news. The two sides confronted each other on the east and west banks of Wuqiao. After two hours of fierce fighting, at 10:20, they began to withdraw westward. In this battle, 12 Japanese soldiers were killed, 2 Chinese translators were killed, and 1 was injured. Zhou's team members Niu Genbao was seriously injured in the leg, Aqing was injured in the right hand, and there were no other losses. At the same time, 37 members of the traitors removal group of the 3rd Battalion of the 10th Detachment of the Zhongyi National Salvation Army and more than 100 members of the 9th Squadron, led by the deputy battalion commander You Guozhen, carried fuel and arrived at their destination at 8:00. They immediately ordered a part of the 9th Squadron to guard the area of Dagong Bridge and a part to guard Qingming Bridge, and to guard the Huangmin Bridge in the South Gate and the South Gate flag station. The rest rushed into the Zhenyi Silk Factory. At that time, Zhou and Hu's troops on the west side had already contacted the Japanese army, and the Japanese army was restrained by them, so You's troops were able to set fire to all parts of the factory, including the stove room, the cleaning room, the silk cooking room, and the accounting room. At that time, a lot of net silk and dry cocoons were stored in the factory, and the estimated loss was more than 300,000 yuan. At 10:00, the unit withdrew northward after the task was completed, and distributed the "Letter to the Workers of the Central China Company," urging them to be sensible.

### British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, Arrives in Shanghai Today; Will Meet with the British Ambassador to China; Scheduled to Return to Tokyo by Ship on the 7th; French Ambassador Cosme Also Rushes to Shanghai for a Meeting

The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, after bidding a temporary farewell to the Japanese authorities after a visit, took the Canadian Empress ship to Shanghai, and will arrive in port at about 2:00 pm today (the 5th). Senior British officials in Shanghai, from the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, downwards, will all come to the port to welcome him. It is understood that the ambassador is here to meet with Ambassador Clark Kerr and to express his feelings. Ambassador Craigie will not stay in Shanghai for a long time, and intends to take a ship to Japan to return to his post on the 7th. If the time is tight, it may be extended to the 8th to leave Shanghai. Although the embassy has not announced the mission of Craigie's arrival in Shanghai, it is generally believed that it is to discuss the future policy of the United Kingdom on the Far Eastern issue. As for the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who originally planned to go to Chongqing immediately to visit the central government authorities, he will leave as soon as he meets with Ambassador Craigie. Yesterday, it was learned that his travel date has been roughly set on the 9th to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong, and then transfer to Chongqing.

The Times reported that two foreign ambassadors stationed in the Far East are expected to arrive in Shanghai within a week. One is Mr. Cosme, who succeeded Mr. Knazevich as the French ambassador to China, will arrive in Shanghai next week. The other is the British ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, who is expected to arrive in port tomorrow (the 5th). Ambassador Cosme is coming to Shanghai for the first time. Although he will take the opportunity to discuss with the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the Far Eastern events that affect the interests of the British government, it is heard that the main nature of this trip is to come to Shanghai for vacation. The British Ambassador to Japan took the Canadian Empress liner and will arrive in port tomorrow. Clark Kerr will meet him. Craigie will only stay in Shanghai for a few days and take a ship back to Japan on Friday. He recently told the press that the purpose of this trip was to take a vacation and to visit Shanghai for the first time, because he took the route through Canada when he went to Japan to take office that day, and did not pass through Shanghai. During Sir Robert Craigie's stay in Shanghai, it is quite possible that he will take the opportunity to meet with the French Ambassador. The French Ambassador has just presented his credentials to the National Government in Chongqing. In the next few days, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr will set off for Chongqing. The purpose of this trip has not been announced. The following speculation news in the Japanese "Hirozhi Newspaper" regarding the imminent arrival of the new French Ambassador in Shanghai seems to confirm the Hong Kong telegram of the Tokyo Daily News. According to the "Hirozhi Newspaper", the new French Ambassador to China, Cosme, presented his credentials to Chairman Lin Sen in early March, and on March 13, he met with General Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing for three hours. It is heard that Cosme agreed to discuss with Chinese and British representatives in Hong Kong the methods of assisting China in the war of resistance. Cosme also said that the French government is preparing to hold a secret meeting, the purpose of which is to cooperate with the Soviet Union to assist China when a European war breaks out. The French Ambassador arrived in Hong Kong on March 23 and will go to Shanghai to meet with the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr.

Regarding the policy of assisting the Chinese government, it is reported that Chairman Chiang expressed disappointment to Britain and France for their attitude when the Japanese army seized Hainan Island. Cosme replied that the current situation in Europe does not allow Britain and France to take any active policies against Japan at present, but Cosme promised Chiang Kai-shek that France will cooperate with Britain in the future to expand active economic assistance to develop the resources of the southwestern provinces of China and will provide China with the convenience of purchasing military supplies.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Announces: This Year's Western and Japanese Board Members; Only Nine Candidates; No Need to Vote; Will Take Office on the 20th Together with the Five Chinese Board Members

The nomination for the 1939 Western and Japanese Board Members election of the Shanghai Municipal Council closed at noon today (the 4th). There are only nine nominated candidates, so there is no need to hold a vote. The following directors will take office on April 20 this year together with the five Chinese directors. The list of Chinese directors has not been notified to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Messrs. A.C. Cornish, C.S. Franklin, G.A. Haley, W.J. Keswick, R.G. MacDonald, G.E. Mitchell, Otsuichi Okamoto, T.S. Powell, and Tominosuke Sugisaka. Only one candidate for this year's Land Commissioner, Mr. R.D.K. Silby, was nominated by the registered property owners in the Public Concession, and he will be considered elected.

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported that there will be no election of board members of the Shanghai Municipal Council this year. Although there have been rumors for several months that the Japanese were attempting to increase the number of representatives, the board members of the Shanghai Municipal Council are still five each for Chinese and British, and two each for American and Japanese. The election of the board members of the council ended at noon today (the 4th) in the Shanghai Municipal Council Building. There were nine seats for foreign board members, and the names received were exactly nine, so there was no need for an election. The American representatives are still the incumbents, so there is no change, namely the current Chairman Franklin and Cornish. There is also no change in the Japanese representatives, namely Otsuichi Okamoto and Tominosuke Sugisaka. Of the five British representatives who were nominated in the recent pre-election, Brigadier General Macnaghten and Mr. Matheson were defeated, and were replaced by San Haley and Powell. The re-elected members are Mitchell Keswick and MacDonald. In the future municipal year, the Shanghai Municipal Council will be composed of these nine people and the five Chinese board members who have not yet been elected. The election of the Chinese board members will be held within two weeks. According to the situation, it seems that the current representatives Guo Shun, Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, Yuan Ludeng, and Yu Qiaqing will all remain unchanged. It was announced at noon today that Silby was elected as the Land Commissioner for 1939. Only one person was nominated by the registered land committee, so there is no need to elect the Land Commissioner.

### Inspection of the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps

The annual inspection and drill of the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps is scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM on the 16th of this month (Sunday). Mr. Stirling, Chairman of the Council, will serve as the reviewing officer.

### Japanese Obstruction of British Ships Loading Pigs: Attempt to Monopolize the Fresh Pork Industry; Forced Loading of Passengers and Cargo with Extra Fees, Pig Traders Extremely Anxious Due to High Stakes

The Japanese are attempting to monopolize the pork industry and exclusively control transportation. British companies Liddell Bros. & Co., and Butterfield & Swire have been weakened and obstructed. The Chiyoda Maru, represented by the Japanese company, Continental Products Company, forces the loading of pigs for Shanghai, with extra fees. Pig traders are extremely anxious due to the high stakes. Details are as follows:

Japanese Obstruction of British Ships Loading Pigs

The British ships "Ma Lei Shu" of Liddell Bros. & Co., and "Whang Poo" of Butterfield & Swire, docked at the new port at 5:00 PM last Sunday to load 2,000 live pigs. A Japanese ship intervened, claiming that Japanese merchants had priority for transporting pigs from that location to Shanghai, and British ships were not allowed to overstep their authority. At the time, a Chinese worker on a barge was slightly injured by gunfire because he was slow to move. The aim is to obstruct British ships from loading goods in Chinese ports, monopolize the British shipping industry in China. However, the "Ma Lei Shu" reasoned with the Japanese and managed to load the pigs anyway. The "Whang Poo" also loaded eggs, fish, and other goods to Shanghai.

Extra Fees Opposed by Pig Traders

The "Chiyoda Maru," represented by the Japanese company Continental Products Company, forcibly loaded more than 1,000 live pigs at the Jiangbei New Port, which were originally allocated to the British ships "Kris Tin Ma Lei Shu" of Liddell Bros. & Co. and "Wuchang" of Butterfield & Swire, arriving in Shanghai yesterday from the new port. It unexpectedly charged an extra two yuan per pig on top of the customs duties, which pig traders unanimously opposed and refused to pay, resulting in inability to take delivery. Due to the prolonged delay, many pigs died or were injured on board, causing great anxiety to the pig traders due to the high stakes. The dispute is currently under negotiation and has not been resolved as of press time.

### British Naval Personnel Awarded for Meritorious Service: British Ship Bombed in Wuhu by Japanese Planes, Crew Member Bravely Saved Many

The "North China Daily News" reports that in December 1937, when Jardine Matheson's ship "De He" (transliteration) was bombed in Wuhu, Yuan Changkai (transliteration), a first-class steward serving on the British warship "Gnat," with the guidance of British naval navigator Lieutenant-Commander Hurst, led the tugboat crew to rescue passengers and crew of the "De He." Yesterday (3rd), on the British flagship "Scorpion," Rear Admiral Holt of the Yangtze River Fleet presented him with a medal to commend his bravery. Last March, Mr. Yuan had already been presented with a silver shield medal by Jardine Matheson to commend his

brave actions.

At the same time, Lieutenant-Commander Hurst was also presented with a silver cigarette case. On March 9th, he received the Distinguished Service Cross from Rear Admiral Holt on the "Scorpion." Among those attending yesterday's award ceremony were officers from the British Naval Office in Shanghai and the British warships "Cardiff" and "Scorpion." Rear Admiral Holt stated during the presentation that on December 5, 1937, when the British ship "De He" was bombed by Japanese planes in Wuhu, First-Class Steward Yuan temporarily gathered the Chinese crew of the tugboat "Qing Yang" (transliteration) to

assist to the best of their ability.

Lieutenant-Commander Hurst rescued many people from the burning ship, his actions were in accordance with the highest traditional regulations of the British Navy and are also a model for us. Because he established this achievement, the British King specially awarded him the Distinguished Service Cross. According to reports, when Japanese planes bombed the "De He," the ship caught fire and burned. Butterfield & Swire's "Da Dong" (transliteration) was also severely damaged. At the time, the tugboat "Qing Yang" was docked next to the "Da Dong." The "Qing Yang" was also attacked but not sunk, but more than half of the crew were killed or injured, so there was a lack of navigators and it could no longer sail. Lieutenant-Commander Hurst of the British warship "Gnat" boarded the tugboat and sailed it away. First-Class Steward Yuan also temporarily gathered the crew to rescue the survivors on the "De He." The "De He" sank after burning, and the "Da Dong" was also holed and ran aground.

### Road Repairs on Beijing Road

### Spiritual Mobilization Conference: Most Encouraging Letter to Compatriots Published: Enhance Strong and Enterprising Spirit: Complete the Mission of the War of Resistance

The Shanghai Municipal All-Circles National Spiritual Mobilization Association was officially established on March 22 this year. Division of organizations has also been actively underway. The National Spiritual Mobilization Association for the industrial sector has also been established. Other sectors such as agriculture, business, vocational, and cultural sectors will also be established within days. The Shanghai Municipal All-Circles National Spiritual Mobilization Association yesterday issued a letter to compatriots, encouraging the city's population to strive for six things, which are reproduced as follows:

Beloved compatriots of the entire city, since our supreme leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the country to announce the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, compatriots across the country have unanimously supported this great revelation by the supreme leader. The people of this city are even more excited. Everyone deeply believes that in this later stage of the War of Resistance, the importance of spirit is even greater than that of material. To unleash the power of the War of Resistance, we must not only invigorate our mental outlook and concentrate our spirit, but also prioritize spirit over material, and by enhancing the strong and enterprising spirit of the nation, we can overcome all difficulties and defeat the tyrannical enemy. Now, in order to thoroughly implement this outline, the organization work of all sectors of the city is being actively promoted. We expect that in the shortest possible time, people from all sectors of agriculture, commerce, industry, and education will be able to participate in the unit of division organizations according to their respective occupational departments. On this day when the spiritual mobilization of our city begins, regarding the six things that must be paid attention to first in the spiritual life of the people, this association encourages all compatriots in the city to strive together.

Participate in Group Life

Since the War of Resistance, the number of residents in the Special Zone has suddenly increased to more than four million. During the Songhu battles, regardless of men, women, old or young, either serving on the front lines or supporting the rear, everyone participated in organizations to resist the enemy and save the nation. After the retreat of the national army to the west, due to objective environmental restrictions, the work of saving the nation was decentralized, and everyone stood at their own posts and intensified their efforts. Now the later stage of the War of Resistance has begun dramatically. The difficulty and greatness of the task is a hundred times greater than before. Our compatriots must strengthen the power of resistance to closely cooperate with the situation in the later stage of the War of Resistance. Then the efforts of each standing at their posts is necessary to return to collective struggle. Now that this association has officially announced its establishment, organizations from all sectors will be established separately within days. We hope that compatriots from all sectors of the city will participate in the branch organizations of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of all sectors. Compatriots from the industrial sector participate in the branch organization of the industrial sector, compatriots from the business sector participate in the branch organization of the business sector, teachers and students from the education sector participate in the branch organization of the education sector, and compatriots from the cultural sector participate in the branch organization of the cultural sector. Other citizens, women, youth, etc. should also participate in the branch organizations of their sector. In short, every citizen must participate in the National Spiritual Mobilization Association and move towards the path of collective struggle.

Concentrate Organizational Strength

Since Chairman Chiang announced the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, some people in the city have automatically established organizations and tried their best to promote it. This is of course a very good phenomenon. Now that this association has announced its establishment, in order to concentrate our strength, we request that all established organizations participate in this association in order to avoid the drawbacks of differences and confusion in the negative aspect. In the positive aspect, we can concentrate all our strength and work hard for the great cause of resistance and construction. We firmly believe that this point will surely win the support and sympathy of all compatriots in the city.

Strengthen the Will to Resist

The later stage of the War of Resistance has begun dramatically. The enemy knows well that the future of the war of aggression will only lead to deeper and deeper mud, and the national strength will decline day by day. Therefore, the enemy's recent military aggression and political conspiracies closely cooperate, attempting to use their most tyrannical ferocity to threaten our spirit of resistance and shake our belief in victory. In fact, the military and civilians across the country deeply believe that the century-old blood debt between China and Japan must be fully compensated in this war of resistance. We are even more convinced that only by resisting to the end can we fight for the independence, freedom and equality of our country. Therefore, the enemy's bestiality and cruelty not only fail to threaten our spirit but also increase our belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance, not only fail to shake our will, but also strengthen the determination to not stop until we drive out the enemy. Our spirit of resistance must be developed during the period when the enemy's threats and oppression intensify us. Our will to resist must be strengthened and consolidated on this day when the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement is launched. All peaceful air and compromise news created by the enemy and traitors must be absolutely rejected and thoroughly corrected.

Eliminate Fearful Psychology

Since the retreat of the national army to the west, although Shanghai has become an isolated island, the people of the city not only have absolutely no fearful psychology, but also the spirit of resisting the enemy and saving the nation is even more firm and enterprising, even more than during the Songhu War of Resistance. On memorial days, national flags fly in every household in the city. Even if they are subjected to unreasonable interference, they will not be threatened in the slightest, and there is no hesitation. However, precisely because of the indomitable and heroic resistance of March 29, the brilliant light filled our eyes, so that the enemy and traitors had nowhere to use their tricks. This great fearless spirit is precisely the expression of the national soul of the Republic of China, and it is also a strong guarantee that our country will surely win the final victory. There is no so-called danger, only danger has meaning, there is no so-called sacrifice, only sacrifice has value. Fear is just a tool of suicide, and resistance is the condition for victory. This is already an iron proof in the history of nations and countries of the world. There is no doubt that on this day when the National Spiritual Mobilization begins to be implemented, fearful psychology should be eliminated completely, and the spirit of great fearlessness should be promoted.

Promote National Spirit

During the period of more than a year since the national army retreated to the west, the Shanghai compatriots' love for the motherland has been seen by the world. Although the government's power has been insufficient, our compatriots have always obeyed the government's laws and regulations and respected the government's intentions. This great and noble national spirit has been shared by China and foreign countries. We hope that the compatriots of the whole city will further promote this national spirit in the future. If anyone, under the guise of special power, does things that violate the law and disrupt discipline, all revolutionary forces should be concentrated to give them the most severe sanctions, so as not to leave the slightest stain in this great and glorious history of the War of Resistance and National Construction.

Strengthen National Integrity

In the more than 5,000 years of history of our country, whenever the country encounters the most

### Guangdong Province Rice Shortage: Import of Foreign Rice for Relief: Executive Yuan Approves Tax Exemption: Limited to 900,000 Piculs

Article 16 of the Measures for Food Regulation in Extraordinary Periods stipulates that if the provincial governments, due to the lack of food in the province, deem it necessary to import foreign rice and wheat with tax exemption or reduction for regulation, they shall request the Ministry of Finance and Economics to forward it to the Executive Yuan for approval before purchasing and transporting it. Now, a rice shortage has occurred in Shantou and other places in Guangdong Province. After the chairman of the province telegraphed the Executive Yuan for relief, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce has received a telegram from Chairman Li saying, "Four Chambers of Commerce, the various rice shortages in this province, according to requests for relief, now the Executive Yuan's electric, roughly says that foreign rice handled by merchants in this province is allowed to enter tax-free at 900,000 dan. Foreign exchange required for rice funds shall be raised by the Guangdong Provincial Government and the shipping merchants themselves. After the War Zone Food Management Office takes overall control, it will allocate imports. I am sending this telegram for your information, and asking the commissioners of districts 1, 3, 5, and 6 to inform the county magistrates. However, after tax-free foreign rice is imported, how to restrict fair prices, avoid being manipulated by merchants, ask the commissioners to supervise the county and city directors to convene relevant groups in advance to discuss, to be truly beneficial to the people."

### Japanese Warships Concentrated in Hangzhou Bay: Serious Defense in Eastern Zhejiang: Japanese Troops Attempt to Cross the Qiantang River Unsuccessfully Again: Zhegan and Xianggui Roads Open to Traffic in Sections

According to the shipping industry news, Japanese warships are concentrated in Hangzhou Bay, and they have plans for eastern Zhejiang. The Japanese warships in Zhejiang have increased to twenty-four, and Japanese planes fly to various places for reconnaissance, but have not dropped bombs. The coastal and river defenses are consolidated, and the garrison troops are waiting for orders. If the Japanese troops want to invade, they will be severely attacked. About 500 Japanese troops in Hangzhou attempted to cross the Qiantang River again on the 2nd, and covered them with artillery fire. After being attacked by the garrison troops, they immediately collapsed. The counties of Wen, Yong, Jin, Xiao, and Shao in eastern Zhejiang are still safe as usual.

Zhegan and Xianggui Roads Open to Traffic in Sections

The direct traffic on the Zhegan and Xianggui Roads has been suspended due to military relations in Nanchang. Now it has been implemented in sections. One Zhejiang section, from Guipu to Dongxiang. The sections from Xiaoshan to Guipu and from Dongxiang to Nanchang have been ordered to be demolished by the railway track. Two Xianggui sections, from Zhangshu to Guilin. The section of the railway track from Nanchang to Zhangshu was demolished, but the highway from Dongxiang to Zhangshu is open, and it is from Dongxiang to Zhangshu.

Foreign Merchants and People Allowed to Export

According to the request of Sheng Shi, the county magistrate of Xiangshan County, the Bo Defense Command asked for clarification. It has been found that foreign merchants and people (Shanghai or other provinces and counties) come to collect accounts in or transport goods from and then return to their hometowns. If there is a formal local shop that reports the results and asks the township co-op or chamber of commerce to provide a guarantee, and then asks for a traffic permit to be issued, should it be approved? Guo Commander replied that if it is confirmed that they are entering the country to collect accounts or handle goods, and then export them, they are allowed to obtain a traffic permit.

Strengthen the Blockade Line of Haimen

After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally notified the consuls of various countries that Haimen in eastern Zhejiang has been blocked and foreign ships are prohibited from traveling, the New Society reporter learned from the shipping industry yesterday that after the blockade line of Haimen Jiaojiang was completely blocked, ships have been prohibited from entering and exiting. Now, in order to strengthen the blockade, several sailing ships have been fully loaded with sand and gravel and sunk in the gaps of the blockade line. Therefore, Haimen will be permanently blocked. The ships that were previously approved to travel on the Wintai line have now changed their routes to, the ships that were previously approved to travel on the Wintai line have now docked at Haimen

### Upcoming Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings from Past Dynasties: Exhibit the Relics of Our Ancestors and Promote the National Spirit

More than 80 famous connoisseurs, art critics, philanthropists, etc. in Shanghai, in response to the Shanghai Physicians' Association's fundraising for medical relief, the preparatory work for the exhibition of calligraphy and paintings from past dynasties has been completed after more than a month. It is scheduled to be previewed at the Daxin Company Gallery on the 10th of this month and officially open to the public on the 11th. The scale is grand and unprecedented. The details are as follows:

Fundraising for Medicine

The purpose of the exhibition is first to raise funds for medical relief. According to investigations, refugees in the inland areas lack medicine, and even minor injuries cannot be treated, and those who sacrifice themselves due to this are difficult to count. Enthusiastic people at home and abroad are concerned about the wounds and call for help, and try their best to raise medicine for relief. However, it is a drop in the bucket and cannot be sustained. The initiation of this association is to meet this need, and it is expected to raise 10,000 yuan, all of which will be handed over to the Shanghai Physicians' Association for transfer to legal organs as a medical relief undertaking.

Spiritual Food

The second purpose is to elaborate on the art of past dynasties in our country and express the great national spirit of our country. At present, the people of the isolated island are in a special situation, and their mental depression has reached its extreme. All they lack is proper appreciation. Exhibiting artistic masterpieces and commemorating the relics of our ancestors can strengthen our beliefs, encourage us to pursue the right path, and entertain ourselves, which is not the most important thing. Therefore, this exhibition is actually the most urgent spiritual food for the people of the isolated island.

Fine Works of Past Dynasties

The significance of the exhibition is so great that the current exhibition is jointly organized by major collectors, and the richness of the quality of the collections is unparalleled. Except for the London preview and the National Art Exhibition held by the state, it can be called an unprecedented grand event of a private group exhibition. Famous collectors Pang Laichen, Li Bake, Pu Xiyuan, Wu Hufan, Chu Minyi, Zhang Congyu, Liu Haisu, Pan Tingshan, Zhu Jinghou, Wang Jiquan, Xu Bangda, Lu Peizhi, Huang Zhongming, Lin Erqing, Pan Zixin, Zhu Qizhan, Ding Huikang, Yu Zicai, Hou Yehua, Qin Qingzeng, and other more than 30 families have hidden secrets that are not easily shown to others, and now they are all participating in the exhibition. There are more than 300 fine works from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, many of which are wanted to be seen by the outside world for a long time but cannot be obtained.

Selling Tickets

The price of each ticket for the association is one yuan in national currency. Now the Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, Daxin Company, and various newspaper offices, major bookstores, major companies, and major pharmacies have started to sell them on behalf of the association. The exhibition dates are from April 11 to 20. At 5 pm on the 10th, the opening ceremony and preview will be held. It is worth one yuan to see famous paintings and help medicine, which should be good news for enthusiastic people and art lovers.

### Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Birthday: Kong Xiangxi and Others Send Congratulations: Yang Caoxian, a Centenarian Elder from Sichuan, Comes from Overseas to Participate in the Grand Ceremony

Your virtue is respected for generations, and you are a human treasure of the country."

Mr. Ma Xiangbo, morality, articles, and education, have contributed to our country, and his historical traces are brilliant and outstanding. The country respects the veteran and the world admires the well-known. On the 6th of this month, his 100th birthday, relatives, old friends, disciples, and old officials, especially held a grand celebration at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in this city, and used the birthday money obtained to help the refugees. Those who celebrate Mr. Shou celebrate the refugees. Mr. Yang Caoxian, a centenarian elder from Sichuan, is also one of the old friends of Xiang Weng. He is angered by his superb cursive writing skills and has traveled to various countries. He is welcomed by the government and the public, and the money obtained from gifting books is worth more than millions, all of which are invested in charity relief without any personal gain. Recently, he has returned from overseas to participate in the grand event, which is also a rare opportunity. Moreover, centenarians are not surprising, and centenarians celebrating centenarians are not surprising. What is surprising is that the two elders are the great elders of the world, and their knowledge and personality have moved the world. The centenarian host and the centenarian guest have never been heard of in the world's history of birthday celebrations.

Broadcasting Birthday Greetings

Tomorrow is Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday. All sectors of the city, in view of Ma's high moral standing and respect, and as a social mentor, and for the purpose of helping refugees, are holding a radio broadcast birthday celebration. We have asked the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's amateur group, fellow villager group, Shanghai Opera Circle Joint Association, film industry, citizen group broadcasting committee, and Zhen Dan Jin Liyang Five County Fellow Villagers Association to participate in the broadcast. It has been decided to start today at the Mainland Radio Station. It is stipulated that for every donation of four yuan, a pair of centenarian birthday bowls will be given, and for every donation of two yuan, a centenarian commemorative badge will be given. Those who donate more will be treated in the same way. All sectors in Shanghai have always been enthusiastic about disaster relief, and it is expected that they will actively donate to benefit the disaster victims.

### Pudong Guerrilla Conference: Ding's Advance Troops Arrive at Xinzhuang

The Pudong guerrillas held their second plenary conference for resisting the enemy in Pudong the day before yesterday (the 2nd) in Datuan, thanks to Yu Taosheng. More than 40 leaders attended, including Ma Bosheng, Ding Xishan, Xu Xinzhou, Fan Gencai, Yan Zeng, Gu Shouxin, and Gu Lifeng. Gu Lifeng served as the chairman, and all participants swore to remain steadfast and safeguard the territory. After the meeting, they went out to appease the people, post slogans everywhere, and issue earnest appeals to the public. At that time, the military and civilians rejoiced, quite similar to the enthusiasm of the Pudong people resisting the enemy during the initial battle of August 13th.

Ding Xueshan's Troops Advance

Ding Xueshan, commander of the Eighth Detachment of the Loyal Patriotic Army, has been fighting the Japanese army in Pudong, Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties, erecting a strong line of guerrilla warfare to contain the Japanese army's activities. Currently, Ding himself has led more than 10,000 elite troops, actively advancing along the Jing-Hu-Hang (Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou) line. Their advance troops have already arrived at Xinzhuang, forming a large encirclement of Songjiang, coordinating with the regular army, which is advancing south from Jiaxing, to attack the Japanese army from both sides, and another route is advancing from Jinshan towards Pinghu, to strike at the rear of the Jiaxing Japanese army. Both routes have now reached their destinations. The Shanghai-Songjiang-Minhang highways are also under the control of Ding's troops, and guerrilla forces lurking in various places are awaiting orders to launch a siege and annihilation of the Japanese army.

Huajing and Chegou Searched

Yesterday, a Japanese warship landed several hundred naval marines in the Guanhang town of Caoxing Township in Puxi. They then set up a perimeter and searched the vicinity, including the towns of Chegou and Huajing. The aforementioned Japanese troops also went to investigate. However, they found nothing.

Fanhangdu Sees Fierce Fighting

The Japanese garrison troops stationed in the Fanhangdu area of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway committed all kinds of atrocities, including raping women. After receiving repeated reports, the guerrillas took advantage of the cloudy and rainy weather yesterday morning (the 3rd), using a feint attack to lure the enemy out of their lair, and then divided a part of their force to strike the enemy's rear, catching them by surprise and launching a fierce attack. At this time, the Japanese troops were attacked from both sides and could not escape. They fought desperately, attempting to break through the encirclement. The two sides engaged in close combat, fighting fiercely for an hour. More than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed on the spot, and more than ten were captured alive. The remaining enemies fled in panic and were not pursued. The captured Japanese soldiers were immediately escorted to the headquarters. At that time, several passenger trains heading from Shanghai to Hangzhou were unable to proceed due to the intense fighting and returned to Zhabei.

### Enthusiastic Disaster Relief: Children Break Piggy Banks, Donating All Their Savings; Tens of Thousands Crowd Around the Donation Platform at the New World Department Store; Presentation of Benevolence Medals Extended for Five Days

Yesterday was Children's Day, April 4th. The weather was sunny and the climate turned warmer. The New World Department Store on Nanjing Road was unprecedentedly crowded. The company had established a donation platform in the department store specifically for this Children's Day, and the store was presenting Benevolence Medals. Anyone who donated two jiao of national currency to the fund for relieving refugee children could receive a medal. The results had been quite good in recent days. Yesterday, however, tens of thousands of people crowded around the platform, all vying to purchase medals. Some children donated all the money they usually spent on sweets, and some even brought their piggy banks, smashed them on the spot, and donated all their savings. The company has now preserved these broken piggy banks as a memento. The importance of cultivating a child's virtue of bravely doing good is indeed very significant. It is reported that yesterday, groups such as the Red Cross Society visited the company and praised the company's actions as being of great educational significance and its achievements as being particularly satisfactory. The company's use of these donations to benefit refugee children is certainly a very beneficial endeavor. Many people from all walks of life have not yet been able to participate due to other commitments, so it has been decided to extend the event for another five days, and the store will continue to present Benevolence Medals. We hope for enthusiastic contributions.

### Anglo-Swiss Company Benefits Refugee Infants: Donates Over Ten Thousand Cans of Sweetened Milk

According to the Continental Daily News, the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company recently donated 16,445 cans of sweetened milk to the International Relief Committee for distribution, which greatly benefits refugee infants. In a letter to the Committee, Mr. Montreux of the company stated that this was made possible through the cooperation of local customers and distributors. This donation was made possible by Chinese mothers who purchased the company's products to feed their babies, so Mr. Montreux's letter urged that this donation be used exclusively to provide to refugee infants. The Committee is now conducting a survey to determine the number of infants in local shelters. According to the latest figures, there are 1,575 refugee infants in the International Settlement and 525 in the French Concession.

### British and Japanese Ships Collide

According to the Chinese-language newspaper, North China Daily News, at around 8:30 AM yesterday (the 3rd), a 1,015-ton merchant ship of the Xiao Shipping Company (transliteration) collided with the Xingyu (transliteration) and the Hushan Maru (transliteration) of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company near buoys 28 and 29. The Xingyu was originally berthed at these two buoys, fully loaded with cargo, heading for Fuzhou. However, when raising anchor, the current was strong, forcing it to approach the Hushan Maru at the entrance and colliding with it. Six of the Xingyu's armored frames were knocked off, but the exact extent of the damage is not yet known. The damage to the Hushan Maru was minor. The Xingyu was severely damaged and will sail to the outer harbor for temporary repairs.

### Husband Forms New Relationship After Separation; Cuckolds His Wife, Treating Her as a Stranger; Tao Zhangrong and Chen Lizhen Detained for Questioning

Tao Yunfeng, a local, started his career in the construction industry and accumulated a considerable fortune. He resides at No. 6, Lane 751, Kangnuot Road, Shanghai West. His son, Tao Zhangrong, is currently 40 years old. On January 24th, 1928, Tao Yunfeng married Guo Linzhen (32 years old), a woman from Pudong, to Zhangrong. However, since Guo entered the family, the relationship between the couple has been discordant, with frequent quarrels. Tao Zhangrong often abused her. His father, Yunfeng, ordered his daughter-in-law to separate from his son. Yunfeng paid her 20 yuan a month for living expenses. In order to ensure her livelihood in her later years, on July 15th, 1933, he enlisted Jin Hongxiang as a witness and recognized his daughter-in-law, Guo Linzhen, as his adopted daughter. He hired lawyer Zhuang Zhenfu to sign a contract, stipulating that if Yunfeng died of old age in the future, Guo could inherit her share of all his inheritance as an adopted daughter. By August 1936, Tao Yunfeng had died of illness. Unexpectedly, all of the inheritance was controlled by Tao Zhangrong, who firmly refused to divide the property with Guo according to the contract his father had made. Therefore, in 1937, Guo filed a lawsuit against her husband, Tao Zhangrong, in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court to divide the inheritance. After a trial, Judge Peng Shi ruled that Tao Zhangrong should hand over Tao Yunfeng's inheritance for division with Guo Linzhen. From then on, the couple's relationship became even worse, like ice and charcoal. Guo Linzhen moved to No. 10, Lane 177, Xinfengji Lane, Guizhou Road. Recently, Guo suddenly discovered that her husband had formed a relationship with a dancer named Chen Lizhen (from Suzhou, 20 years old), and they were cohabiting in the old house, acting as a cuckoo occupying a magpie's nest. It has been more than three months since then, and he treats his former wife as a stranger. Feeling unwilling, she reported to the Gordon Road Police Station on the 15th of last month, requesting an investigation. Chief Detective Zhu Mengwei and Detective Chen Shanji reported to the Special Court and obtained a search warrant. On the 17th, they rushed to investigate and found Tao Zhangrong and Chen Lizhen cohabiting in the same room. Therefore, they requested the Special Court to issue a summons, ordering Tao and Chen to appear in the Fourth Criminal Division of the Special Court for questioning yesterday morning. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo opened the court to summon them. Both defendants failed to appear. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the previous situation and sued Tao Zhangrong and Chen Lizhen for adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law, requesting a warrant for their arrest due to their failure to appear. Tao Guo Linzhen then explained the situation, stating that she would sue both her husband and the adulteress. Judge Dai approved the case to be rescheduled for trial.

### Case of Forcible Rape of Female Teaching Assistant: Xie Xiangsheng Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment; Xie Refuses Sentence and Prepares to Appeal

Xie Xiangsheng, a native of Changzhou, 39 years old this year, used to be a class teacher at the Lagena Chinese Primary School established by the French Municipal Council, residing at No. 14, Jiyi Lane, Rue Poupard. In April 1937, he advertised for a female teaching assistant. At that time, Wang Jie, a girl from Liuhe, Taicang County, 20 years old but actually only 18, graduated from a rural senior primary school. Due to her family's poverty, she was unable to continue her studies. She came to Shanghai to seek a work-study opportunity to further her education. Seeing Xie's advertisement, she wrote to apply and was hired by Xie with a monthly salary of 15 yuan. Her job was to grade homework submitted by elementary school students in Xie's residence. Unexpectedly, about half a month after Wang started working for Xie, Xie forcibly raped her and then deceived her with promises of engagement and a formal wedding. He repeatedly raped her. Wang was physically weak and became ill due to the abuse. Unexpectedly, Xie issued an order to evict her, kicking Wang out without regard. At this point, Wang realized that she had been deceived and lost her chastity. She contacted Xie for negotiation but was ignored. Therefore, her mother, Wang Wu, as her legal guardian, accompanied Wang Jie and hired lawyer Qian Yuan to sue Xie Xiangsheng in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for offenses against morality, requesting that he be tried according to law. In the first instance, Xie Xiangsheng was found not guilty. Wang Wu and Wang Jie did not accept this and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. At that time, Xie was dismissed from the school and moved, making it impossible to serve the summons. The appeal trial was suspended. After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Xie established a personnel trust office, advertised for applicants, and embezzled more than 500 yuan in guarantee money from the applicants. After being reported by the victims, the Public Concession Police arrested Xie and sent him to the First Special District Court for trial. As a result, Xie was sentenced to one year in prison. Xie did not accept this and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. After investigation, the Third Branch of the High Court transferred Xie Xiangsheng to the case opening court and held a joint trial. Wang Wu had returned to her hometown and Wang Jie had gone to the political department of the Eighth Route Army, so neither was summoned. Only their agent, lawyer Qian Yuan, attended the case and declared the closing to Xie, scheduling the date of the verdict. All the circumstances have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the case was previously ruled, the original judgment was revoked, and Xie Xiangsheng was sentenced to six months in prison. It is reported that Xie expressed his disagreement with the sentence in court and declared that he would appeal. The court approved it, and Xie was sent back to the Second Branch of the High Court for review. (According to the embezzlement part, the First Special District Court sentenced him to one year in prison. Xie Xiangsheng disagreed and appealed. The appeal has also been concluded, the appeal was rejected, and the original judgment was upheld, as reported in yesterday's newspaper.)

### New Food Arrives in Nanshi Refugee Area: Coarse Rice Mixed with Sand and Stones; Father Zhao Is Furious; French Police Investigate

There are now more than 40,000 refugees in the Nanshi refugee area, and the amount of food supplied to them every day is enormous. Recently, Xie Dabo, the French vice-consul and member of the Supervisory Committee of the area, entrusted Heng Dali (transliteration), a foreign comprador of Hengda Foreign Firm, and Su Weiguang, a Chinese comprador, to purchase 1,000 bags of yellow coarse rice as a precautionary measure. The rice arrived at the general office of the Nanshi refugee area the day before yesterday. The supply group found on the spot that hundreds of bags of the lowest quality coarse rice were mixed in, and there were quite a few flower stones, sand, and broken rice mixed in, obviously only seeking profit and disregarding the people's food. After Father Zhao, the person in charge of the area, learned of this, he was furious and sent Chief Director Gu Lun, General Affairs Group Leader Jiang Qanquan, and Inspectors Shen Yaoguo and Gu Qiansheng to negotiate with the firm with samples of the substandard rice, and secretly to investigate the rice merchants. It is now known that Gu et al. have obtained conclusive evidence and reported to Zhao. Based on the report, Zhao reported to the French Concession Police Department, and the Police Department sent detectives to the police station yesterday to summon all the witnesses for investigation according to law. Once the investigation is completed, lawsuits will be filed separately with the consulate and the court.

After the Japanese troops left, out of resentment and despair, she had thoughts of ending her life, so she secretly hanged herself in the room. By the time her family noticed, she had already died. Also, at around 9 AM yesterday, a farmer Chen, who lives in Linjia Lane, Zhongshan Road, was working in the fields when suddenly three Japanese troops (one of whom was wearing a blue coppersmith's outfit) disguised as workers staggered along and immediately took out a gun and shot Chen, hitting him in the right leg. He fell to the ground, but fortunately it was not a vital part and he was able to save his life.

### Next Year's World Games Track and Field Events: New Standards Set for Preliminary Round Results; 30 Countries Already Participating as of February; Elimination System to Be Used for This Year's Yacht Race

(Special Dispatch from Finland) The International Amateur Athletic Federation has recently stipulated "New Standards for Preliminary Round Results" for the 1940 Olympic Games track and field events. Several of the standards are much stricter than those at the Berlin Games. Athletes must achieve the specified minimum score to qualify for the finals. The new standards for each event are listed below:

Event　New Standard　Berlin Games Standard

High Jump　1.87 meters　1.85 meters

Long Jump　7.20 meters　7.15 meters

Pole Vault　3.90 meters　3.80 meters

Triple Jump　14.50 meters　14 meters

Discus Throw　45 meters　44 meters

Javelin Throw　65 meters　60 meters

Hammer Throw　56 meters　49 meters

There is no preliminary round for the shot put; however, the competition will be held simultaneously in three locations. For the events with preliminary rounds, twelve athletes will qualify for the finals. If fewer than twelve athletes qualify for the finals, the remaining spots will be filled by selecting the athletes with the highest scores from those who did not qualify. For example, if only nine athletes achieve 65 meters in the javelin throw, the three athletes with the closest scores to 65 meters will qualify for the finals. To avoid excessively lengthy competitions in the high jump and pole vault, the International Athletic Federation Committee has established rules for increasing the height of the bar. The high jump will start at 1.70 meters, followed by 1.80 meters, 1.90 meters, 1.95 meters, 1.98 meters, 2.01 meters, 2.04 meters, 2.07 meters, and so on. Similarly, the pole vault will start at 3.60 meters, followed by 3.80 meters, 3.95 meters, 4.10 meters, 4.20 meters, 4.30 meters, and so on. The method of scoring for the yacht race was authorized by the International Yachting Conference held in London last year to be freely determined by the Finnish World Games Organizing Committee. It is reported that the yachting division of the organizing committee has decided to adopt an elimination system. All races will be held over seven days to determine the winners. Generally, boats with excessively slow speeds will be eliminated after four or five days, and approximately eleven yachts will compete in the final race.

### Ticket Sales Are Booming

Ticket sales for the World Games are progressing well. Ticket orders from various countries continue to arrive daily. According to estimations by the organizing committee based on requests and inquiries from various sources, the level of interest in the 1940 Olympic Games in Finland and other countries has reached a very high level. The Olympic Committees of countries such as England, the United States, and Sweden have also pre-ordered tickets from Finland on behalf of various sports associations in their respective countries. Domestic public sales have also begun. According to announcements from Finland, tickets will be sold through major international shipping companies and travel agencies. The deadline for ticket requests within Finland was February 20th, and a total of 200,000 requests were received. Of course, a large portion of these 200,000 requests will be rejected. According to special instructions from the ticket sales department of the Finnish organizing committee, those who placed their orders at the beginning of this year will definitely receive tickets, while those who ordered later may not be able to get them. At that time, the allocation of pre-ordered tickets will be adjusted based on the needs of each country. The ticket sales department also pointed out that orders must be placed using special pre-order forms, which must be filled out and returned to the designated agency for forwarding to Finland. Based on the orders received, the events that countries are most interested in are weightlifting, rowing, equestrian events, boxing, and gymnastics.

### American Boys' School Awards Ceremony Today

The American Boys' School will hold a sports awards ceremony at 12:20 PM today. Mr. Bo Latte, director of the Sports Department of the West, is invited to preside over the ceremony. In addition to awarding prizes to various athletes of the school, the school league trophy sponsored by the school will be presented. Representatives of each winning team are invited to participate. There will be various special program performances at that time.

Science and Life

### Science and Impoverished Youth

— Ji Qian

In our country today, science is needed for everything. Most people think that science, unlike other subjects, requires teachers to lecture and considerable equipment for practice to find a way to learn. Therefore, society recognizes science as aristocratic, closely related to money, as if impoverished youth, even if they are naturally close to science and most interested in it, have no opportunity to study science simply because of their poor family circumstances. However, from the perspective of the history of science, such ideas are not entirely correct. There are many opportunities for wealthy children to study science, but impoverished children are not limited by money and cannot enter its halls. The key is to work tirelessly and use it anytime, anywhere. Take Faraday, the great British electrician, for example. He was extremely poor in his childhood. He worked as a servant in a chemistry laboratory, but he was diligent in learning and asking questions, and always received instruction from Professor Davy. Later, he made contributions that shocked the world. Edison, the great American inventor, is known to everyone for his inventions in science that have benefited mankind, but he started as a poor child who could not attend school. He made a living by selling newspapers on the street. One of his ears was slapped by someone, resulting in lifelong deafness. Those who read his biography know his childhood and how he single-mindedly pursued science, eventually achieving unprecedented success and becoming a great man in history. From this perspective, Faraday still had the convenience of seeking instruction from others, while Edison did not even have that. He relied entirely on his personal struggle to achieve his goals. I have seen a small grocery store merchant in the United States who studies insects in his spare time and becomes a famous entomologist, writing extensively. A gardener became a botanist and later became a university professor. A servant in a museum became a geologist and paleontologist, and later became a senior technician at the museum. A servant in a chemistry laboratory became a chemical expert and later a university professor. There are countless such wonderful stories. European and American countries have benefited from science, and their universities and research institutes have indeed made great contributions, but the struggles of their impoverished youth from the lower classes have also been significant. Today, impoverished children in our country are advocating self-study. May they not hesitate in the face of difficulties and turn away from science!

### Increased Use of Aluminum

— Gu Huabao

According to the 1937 statistics on metal production, the production of aluminum increased more than other metals, indicating that the use of aluminum is rapidly increasing.

According to the statistics, from 1924 to 1937, the production of aluminum and nickel each increased threefold, and the production of gold increased twofold. The increase in the production of other metals was much smaller: copper increased by 74%, zinc by 66%, tin by 47%, iron by 42%, aluminum by 33%, and silver by only 6%.

Before the European War, the production of aluminum, calculated by weight, ranked sixth among metals, but by 1937 it had risen to fifth place. If calculated by volume, it would rise to fourth place, because aluminum is very light. The volume of one hundred tons of aluminum is equal to the volume of the following tons numbers of various metals: 266 tons of zinc, 270 tons of tin, 290 tons of iron, 327 tons of Nickel, 330 tons of copper, 389 tons of silver, 419 tons of lead, 714 tons of gold.

Calculated by weight, the aluminum produced in 1913 was 825 parts per million of the iron produced in that year. The aluminum produced in 1924 was 2,486 parts per million of the iron produced in that year. The aluminum produced in 1937 was 5,236 parts per million.

The increase in aluminum production is even more evident when calculated by volume. The aluminum produced in 1913 was 2,400 parts per million of the iron produced in that year. The aluminum produced in 1924 was 7,230 parts per million of iron. The aluminum produced in 1937 was 152,30 parts per million.

If we compare the volume of aluminum and lead, the aluminum produced in 1913 was 230,800 parts per million of the lead produced in that year. However, by 1937, the production of aluminum exceeded the amount of lead produced, reaching 1,232,000 parts per million of lead.

If we compare the volume of aluminum and silver, the aluminum produced in 1913 was 39 times the silver produced in that year. The aluminum produced in 1924 was 89 times the silver produced in that year. By 1937, aluminum was 251 times the silver.

### Acquaintance at First Sight

— He Shan

Botflies are harmful to horses because their larvae parasitize the horse's stomach and intestines, causing various ailments, such as disrupting the function of the stomach, hindering digestion; absorbing nutrients from food, preventing the horse from getting adequate nutrition; blocking the pylorus of the stomach, obstructing communication between the stomach and small intestine; and larvae entering the large intestine and rectum, irritating the intestinal lining, causing the horse to feel distressed. This fly lays its eggs on the horse's hair, usually on the front legs and chest, using a type of liquid adhesive. When the horse licks the area with its tongue, the eggs enter the mouth and eventually reach the stomach. After about ten days, they hatch into larvae, causing the diseases mentioned above. This fly's instinct is to choose a suitable host, so its eggs are not laid on donkeys, mules, cattle, or sheep, but only on horses. It seems to have a thorough understanding of horses. Horses suffer from the pain and fear it greatly. They are not afraid of ordinary horseflies, only shaking their heads and tails to swat them away, but they become extremely frightened at the sight of this botfly, often running wildly into farm trees and shrubs to avoid it, as if they had entomological knowledge about this fly. This clearly demonstrates the animal instinct.

### America's Silver Vault

— Ye Ren

America is known as the Land of Gold, and gold and silver from all over the world flow to it. How it stores its vast wealth is something that people want to know. It is said that its gold is currently stored in the vault at Fort Knox. Its silver is stored in a reinforced concrete fortress-style silver vault on the grounds of West Point Military Academy, as shown in the picture, which can store silver bars worth 200 billion US dollars. The vault is only one story high, with walls one foot thick, fitted with steel doors weighing fifteen tons that are fireproof and drill-proof. Each corner of the building is equipped with a guardhouse, guarded day and night.

### Light-Sensitive Anti-Aircraft Shells

— Tai Gong

According to recent information obtained by the United States, Sweden is manufacturing an anti-aircraft shell containing a photoelectric tube that causes the shell to explode automatically when it passes its target. To destroy a bomber or render it combat ineffective, it is only necessary for this shell to fly close to it. This can be said to be a new threat to air raiders.

When the shell is in flight, a lamp inside the shell emits intense rays of light from many holes in the nose of the shell. When these rays of light hit the body of an aircraft, they are reflected into similar holes in the bottom of the shell, and concentrated by prisms and lenses onto a photoelectric tube. The current generated by this tube then activates a relay, connecting a circuit that causes the priming explosive to detonate. The detonation of this explosive causes the main high explosive, T.N.T., to explode—at which point the exploding shell can do the greatest damage.

This shell has a clever mechanism and can be used both at night and during the day. Its circuitry is appropriately adjusted to only respond to rapidly intermittent flashes of light, such as the intermittent light that it emits itself when rotating in flight. Therefore, only the light emitted by itself and reflected from the aircraft can cause it to explode; sunlight or other light cannot. If it misses its target and fails to explode, it will be detonated by a secondary fuse as it descends.

The light emitted by the anti-aircraft gun is reflected from the enemy aircraft into the shell, causing the shell to explode.

### Hobbies

— Qiao Xia Ke

The mention of these two words brings to mind opium and mahjong. However, this article does not discuss these. I only wish to define the term "hobbies" and give an example of a hobby that everyone needs but that you would never guess for the moment, to prove the important relationship between hobbies and life.

The definition of hobbies has broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense: anything that can excite the spirit or provide a pleasant enjoyment is a hobby; in a narrow sense: anything that can improve appetite and aid digestion is a hobby. For example, tobacco, alcohol, tea, etc., belong to the broad sense, while all the sauces, vinegar, ginger, scallions, peppers, chili peppers, etc., used in cooking belong to the narrow sense. Although there is such a distinction, there is no strict boundary. The characteristic of hobbies is that they are easily acquired but difficult to get rid of. I still remember that a certain professor in the past liked opium and hated alcohol, listing the harms of alcohol in great detail, while another professor liked alcohol and hated tobacco, listing the harms of tobacco in great detail, but many students listening to the lectures did not avoid tobacco and alcohol as a result, but became proficient in both, surpassing their teachers in both, demonstrating the profound influence of hobbies.

People often think that hobbies are dispensable things, which is not necessarily true. I will now give an example of a hobby that everyone cannot do without, and that is the salt we eat. Those who have studied biology or physiology may say that salt is a necessary component of cells, so how can it be listed alongside tobacco, alcohol, ginger, and scallions and called a hobby? That's right, salt is a necessary component of cells, so there is salt in both plants and animals. The food we eat comes from the plant and animal kingdoms, so we have already eaten salt at the same time. I ask, is the salt that we eat—that is, the salt inherent in food and not added extra—enough for our use? In fact, it can be said to be enough. Haven't you seen shepherds adding salt to the grass before cattle and sheep eat it (modern pastures do add salt to the grass)? When tigers and wolves chase rabbits, no idle men would be so bold as to take on the job of sprinkling salt on the rabbits' backs. They do not feel a salt shortage, which proves that the amount of salt inherent in food is enough for use. Perhaps some people say that we humans are different. Fortunately, there is a low-salt diet in the treatment of tuberculosis, where no salt is allowed to be added when preparing food, which similarly proves this fact. Now it can be concluded that the salt inherent in food is necessary for our use and cannot be called a hobby, but the salt used in the kitchen for making soup and cooking is all extra salt, and its function is nothing more than to improve the taste of food, increase appetite and aid digestion, which is a hobby. Usually, the salt we talk about specifically refers to extra salt, which is the most common hobby. From a personal point of view, three days without salt is a matter of great anxiety; from a social point of view, the salt administration and the salt transport of Lianghuai in the past dynasties have been quite complex. We can no longer underestimate hobbies.

Suppose we actually became people of Wu-Huai and Ge-Tian, returning to the custom of eating raw meat and drinking blood. No matter if some people regard it as supreme happiness and others regard it as very boring, gradually there would be Du Kang, there would be Liu Ling, there would be Indians, there would be Columbus, and gradually foreigners would play mahjong and Chinese people would play poker. This is humanity's forte; the so-called salt of all things, is this one end of the spirit?

Magnetic Storm　　Peisheng

In the early spring of last year, the most violent geomagnetic disturbance in many years was discovered on Earth. At that time, radio stopped, marine compasses went haywire, land telegraph lines were "blocked," and telecommunication drivers received electric shocks. The reason for this was an unusually large sunspot on the sun, which was seen by observatories all over the world.

Scientific Gleanings　　Peisheng

An American astronomer predicts that the world's organisms may be wiped out in another 100 million years because the iron rust on Earth will have absorbed all the free oxygen by then.

Although the human nostril is only one cubic inch in size, it houses a most complete air handling device that regulates temperature, humidity, pressure, and flow.

### Finance: Hong Kong Traders Limit-Price Searching Buys, Cash Continues to Advance; Only Extremely Rare Variations Midday, Full-Day Range of Only One Dollar

Yesterday's spot Hsia-Chih market conditions continued to be high, already breaking through the 1070 yuan mark. This was truly because the potential of the Hong Kong exchange rate turned strong, leading to the Hong Kong gold price recently being higher than the Shanghai market gold price. Seeing the possibility of profit, Hakka traders entrusted a certain gold shop to search for and buy at a limited price. They also purchased in large quantities from a certain money exchange shop, and since the European situation is daily relaxing, people's hearts are more stable, so the market is firm and steady. However, in the midday market, money exchange shops, acting on behalf of regular merchants and hawkers, eagerly dumped at high prices, so supply and demand were equal, leading to extremely rare variations in the process. The result was a continued rise of four yuan, and trading was slightly more active than the previous day, approximately 850 taels. Silver shop jewelry gold did not see any changes. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to fall.

Hsia-Chih Spot Good for Four Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the gold shop initially bid 2072 yuan to buy, but sellers required 75 yuan before being willing to supply. Both sides directly held out until around ten o'clock before trading began. First, the gold shop took in 50 taels from the money exchange shop, with an opening price of 2073 yuan, four yuan higher than the previous close. After opening, another 50 taels were taken from silver shop and gang gold shops at the same price. Then, another 150 taels were taken from the money exchange shop, with the price still the same. After a while, another 50 taels were taken from the money exchange shop, with the price also at 73 yuan. Subsequently, because sellers were difficult to find, the gold shop forcefully took in 350 taels from a money exchange shop, with the highest price being 74 yuan and 5 jiao (it was said all were on behalf of Hong Kong traders to purchase). After this, supply and demand in the market were scarce, making it difficult to do business. The midday close was still at 73 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold shop first absorbed 50 taels from the money exchange shop, with the price at 72 yuan. Then, the money exchange shops did 50 taels among themselves, with the price at 72 yuan and 5 jiao. Later, the gold shop again took in 50 taels from the money exchange shop, with the price at 73 yuan. After this, the gold shop wanted to absorb more at a limited price of 73 yuan, but sellers all stopped selling to wait and see. Extended to the late close without seeing any business done, so the late close was still 2073 yuan. As a result, it rose four yuan compared to the previous close, with a full-day range of only one yuan. The cash shop's own brand gold selling price was 2080 yuan, and buying price was 2070 yuan, and spot mark gold was about 50 yuan lower than the brand name gold, but there was no business.

Silver Shop Jewelry Gold Still at Original Price

Silver shop jewelry gold per tael for sale, because Hsia-Chih rarely changed, Da Tong Heng still hung the original price of 210 yuan, Xin Tong Heng was 208 yuan, buying in at 202 yuan.

British Pure Gold Shrunk Another Penny

A London telegram from the 3rd stated that British pure gold shrunk another penny per ounce due to the slightly easing European situation and the good potential of the pound, with many accounts continuing to sell, reaching a retreat to 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 pence. The central bank's Chinese cash buying price also fell to 1211 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold also fell 2 li, calculated as 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell 7 jiao accordingly, calculated as 1206 yuan and 9 jiao.

### Foreign Currencies See Mixed Ups and Downs

Yesterday British pure gold fell one penny, British-American exchange rate fell two-five. The settlement of foreign currency at the port was very active, and the banks' intention to sell was smooth, so the market price was stable. The Hsia-Chih opening price, carrying forward the previous night's bullishness, tended slightly higher. Later, the supply and demand between the gold shops and money exchange shops was not strong, and the situation showed fluctuations. The daily changes were narrow, and the result was a slight rise. Foreign currencies, British, American, gold pounds, the rich slightly began to absorb, British and American gold notes, demand was still strong, Hong Kong notes, Chinese and foreign banks absorbed very smoothly, continued to show firmness, each currency saw mixed ups and downs, the trend fluctuated. The Association's trading was not smooth, Changtai sold and Hongchang bought shilling notes for 50 pounds, Huitong sold and Tongfeng bought American gold notes for 600 yuan, Fuhexing sold and Zhenxing bought French franc notes for 1000 units. Yesterday's market prices, British gold pound rose one jiao, British gold note fell one fen, American gold note rose five hao, Hong Kong note rose one li, French franc note rose two hao and a half, Singapore note fell one fen, Robbie note fell five li, Canadian note rose one fen, Philippine and Italian notes each fell one fen, German gold note fell five fen, Siamese note rose five fen, only American gold pound, Dutch note, Annam note, and Australian gold note did not change.

### Discount of Fifty Yuan per Thousand Unchanged

Yesterday's discount rate for drawn bills of exchange remained constant at fifty yuan per thousand, which was no different from the previous day.

### Recent Large-Bar Forward Rates Reduced, Indian Silver Slightly Turns Weak

A London telegram from the 3rd stated that speculators in the silver market slightly sold, trading was quiet, and the market was flat. After closing, it continued to be calm. Citibank merchants bought at the listed price, and sellers waited and watched. Large-bar silver, recent forward rates reduced by 0.0625, distant forward rates unchanged. Also, a New York telegram stated that the American spot price remained unchanged.

### Securities: Reserve Bank Implementation Rumors, Domestic Debt Shows Signs of Strength, Foreign Debt Remains Weak

The gray market for securities: Yesterday's market gradually became excited. Rumors of peace abounded, and people's confidence suddenly turned bullish. There were rumors that the Central Bank would be reorganized into a Reserve Bank, and that the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank would also increase their capital. In this way, the newly issued 1.2 billion public bonds would also have a place to be absorbed, and there were also rumors of reducing deposit interest rates. Furthermore, the British Ambassador's meeting offered hints regarding peace. People's sentiment became more excited, and short covering and long positions followed one after another, so the upward momentum was quite strong. At the close, people's confidence was even stronger, and there was still room for future development. Yesterday's activity: At the morning opening, Deyi initially bought in, and Dafenghao was particularly eager. Runlihao did not hesitate to raise prices. Yuankang No. 4 and individual investors bought in one after another. Although Renchang, Shunheng, Tongkang, and Dafeng and others sold on the table, the supply and demand were very unbalanced. The situation was even better in the afternoon. Tongkanghao switched from selling to buying. Runli and Dafeng searched again. Renchang, Xieda, Lianhe and No. 11 sold successively. The market price still rose steadily. As a result, it continued to rise from 15 cents to 30 cents. The total number of transactions totaled 780,000 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Taking Advantage of Customer Sales Development, Major Existing Yarn Dealers Return to Add Bets, 20-count Special Jincheng Already Reaches 400 Yuan

Yarn market prices trended upward. Although actual demand was not weak, the buying from Hong Kong and Shantou was not as enthusiastic as the previous day. The market sentiment took advantage of customer sales development. Buying power was still sufficient, so the momentum remained hot. The market situation saw another rise. However, some bulls, because the price was already 23-24 yuan higher than the low point, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line was affected by the war, making transportation impossible, the yarn sales still declined. Some sellers unloaded, but others said that the recent buying spree from Shantou was also for transporting goods to Jiangxi for sale, transported via the inland rivers of Shantou, but the travel time was very slow. Therefore, the bullish sentiment was extremely strong, and the market price rose and fell intermittently, up and down inconsistently. In the afternoon, the peak price of 20-count Special Jincheng reached 400 yuan. Tiannu was traded at 390 yuan. Then, as the buying wind subsided slightly, the market price immediately fell back.

Spot Yarn Situation: At the opening this morning, because the previous day's rise had been strong, everyone predicted that there would be a slight correction. The customer side observed and did not make a move, so the opening price did not change. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was still 383 yuan. A short time later, the public said that a huge amount had been purchased for customer sales the previous day. Individual investors suddenly saw selling, falling by 2 yuan. Unexpectly, a certain colleague suddenly came in to buy. The Chaozhou-Shantou group ate dozens of bales of spot yarn, and then a buying wind was set off. The market price rose slowly, and mutual buying continued. By the time of closing, the highest price was 387 yuan. The mood was tight at the opening in the afternoon. There was another surge of 2 yuan, and Double Horse was 389 yuan, but it fell by 4 yuan in a moment, the price was 385 yuan. It is said that the buyers sold to take profits due to the high price, so it fell immediately. According to statistics, various groups bought a total of 1,645 bales throughout the day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 2 yuan, Special Jincheng rose by 3 yuan, and others were flat. Chongxin Factory opened 2,600 bales of 6-count Dafa, the price was 300 yuan, for April-May delivery. Yong'an Factory opened 50 bales of 20-count Special Jincheng, the price was 400 yuan. The amount of each group's purchase is listed on the left: Colleagues: 665. Hong Kong: 225. Fuzhou: 55. Shantou: 385. Quanzhou: 10. Inland: 145. Yunnan: 125. Xiamen: 5. Tianjin: 30. Total: 1,645. The yarn market opened flat, rose in the middle, and then rose again in the afternoon. The momentum was still strong. Although the actual transactions were flat, the market price moved forward step by step, and the major dealers were all in a bullish position, so the pull was getting stronger. The spot price of 20-count Shuiyue was 348 to 350 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Lanfeng was 344 to 346 yuan.

### Rumors of the "Bankhead-Jones" Bill, Passed in Washington, Spot Cotton Prices in This City are Especially Strong, Four Yuan Higher per Load than Futures

Foreign cotton market price: New York cotton market fell in the early morning due to the drop in Liverpool telegrams and the sale by overseas cotton merchants. Later, it was rumored that the so-called "Bankhead-Jones" bill, which was produced by Smith's proposal for modification, had been passed in Washington. The content is that any farmer who voluntarily reduces cotton fields below the legal limit can purchase loan cotton from the government at a price of 5 cents per pound, for a total of 3 million bales. However, everyone expected that this bill would be opposed by the public. After passing through the House of Representatives, it will also be greatly revised. As a result, cotton prices rose by 6-7 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 1 rupee, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 20 points. Converted into legal tender, cotton prices all rose. US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 6 cents per load, Indian cotton rose by 3 and a half cents, and Egyptian cotton rose by 2 yuan.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading remained extremely quiet. No transactions were heard from Chinese and foreign factories. Only the yarn price continued to rise. If it can rise again for a few days, the foreign cotton trading may still return to its old appearance. However, at present, various factories need to purchase spot goods very urgently, so the spot price on the market is especially strong, more than 4 yuan higher per load than futures, creating a special record, because there is a shortage of goods on the market. The foreign cotton futures prices yesterday, converted into ex-factory prices including tax, are listed below: Raw Materials, Category, Ex-factory including tax 60-count Egyptian cotton Superior: 104.75. Middle: 101.85. 80-count Superior: 39.80. Middle: 29.60. 20-count American Mite-Afifi: 83.85. Inferior: 70.70. 32-count Superior: 92.55. Inferior: 81.65. 42-count Superior: 94.35. Inferior: 82.60. South American Brazilian Cotton Superior: 88.15. Middle: 84.80. Inferior: 75.70. 10-count Indian Pingguoer: 62.15. 16-count Indian Omerla: 64.75. 20-count Indian Bailuoqu: 72.50. 24-count Indian Pengjiapu: 79.90. 32-count American Synt: 85.05. 31-count 42-count American Pengjiapu: 89.50.

Native Cotton Business: The local cotton business is becoming increasingly dull. Factories generally have no action because Indian cotton arrivals are increasing daily, and factory needs can still be supplied. However, the cotton is dry, astringent and uneven, so they also buy white package cotton for mixing and adjusting. In this way, the work can be smooth, and the color of the yarn can be beautiful. Therefore, although the business is light, the selling price is difficult to fall, in fact, because the goods are too scarce. However, Tongzhou cotton is slightly weaker by 5 cents, and the price of Huoji cotton is still not much different from the previous day. The source of goods from Subei is weakening. Only 400 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock. The current cotton situation is listed on the left: Huoji Cotton 70.50, purchased by colleagues, 200 bales, cash at the wharf. Haitijian 71.84, purchased by colleagues, 100 bales, cash at the wharf. Tongzhou Cotton 77.00, purchased by colleagues, 200 bales, remittance at the wharf.

### Grains: New Shipments of Imported Flour Arrive in Large Quantities, Flour Prices All Show an Upward Trend

Factory Flour

Yesterday's factory spot flour market continued to rise. It was found that after the factory's actual sales to customers resumed uniformity, the purchases in this street gradually increased. Spot sales to foreign groups and inland areas were also not weak. However, the factory currently focuses on sales to the north, and does not accommodate retail sales, so the number of transactions has not developed specially. The total number of transactions in the city reached more than 40,000 bags. The second flour factory's price is still $4.40. It is heard that the factory's contracted imported wheat has arrived on another ship, and a large batch of imported flour has newly shipped to Shanghai, so the market is difficult to predict. It was found that 22,000 bags of flour were exported and transported to Tianjin.

Imported Flour

A new shipment was handled by Shunquanlong Foreign Company, amounting to a huge 260,000 bags. One theory is that it amounted to more than 160,000 bags. This cargo has already been imported and is being unloaded. The trading of spot imported flour on the market is still not deserted. However, the current float is small. Large dealers holding goods, in view of the new contract flour being difficult to allocate, successively adhere to their holdings, so the market is prospering. It is heard that the price of high-end brands has risen from 4.10 yuan cash to 4.15 yuan. The price of mid-range brands is 4.12-3 yuan, also up by 2-3 cents. However, a large batch of new arrivals have already arrived in Shanghai, so the market may still change.

Wheat

In terms of source, in addition to a new shipment of wheat contracted by factories, the arrival of local wheat is still lacking. Various factories are increasingly indifferent to the need for local wheat, and the market is lacking in both inventory and arrivals, presenting a situation of both supply and demand being deserted. As a result, the market has stopped again.

### Thick and Thin Japonica Rice in the Middle Range Shows Well

Yesterday, the source of supply for various groups was still only He Xia No. 7. The Kunshan group and Changzhou group of the Soviet-Tong group arrived with a total of more than 2,000 packages by cart. The overall market: at the opening in the early market, it still appeared stagnant. Later, the local street began to move, and the situation gradually became lively. Subsequently, national customers also inquired slightly, and all selected the lower-priced goods in the middle range. As a result, the market showed a high and tight situation. As a result, except for the high price of thick and thin Japonica rice, there was no up or down, and the middle range and He Xia goods all showed several cents of improvement. Du Yangjian and Bu Jian remained level in terms of arrivals and sales, with no up or down. Bian Yuan has been slightly active recently, and the market price has been able to stand slightly.

### Customer Indica Rice Rebounds Nearly 10 Cents

Customer indica rice has been flat and tired for days, and the customer storage took the opportunity to absorb it. Yesterday, the customer group's Xinghang storage buying was particularly strong. The local street's various households continued to inquire, and the market price gradually rebounded after the morning market, ranging from 5-6 cents to nearly 10 cents higher than the previous market. The total number of transactions for the day increased to more than 4,000 packages, mostly collected by Xinghang. Wu indica rice opened at 12.7-8 yuan, and middle range goods also opened at 12.4-5 yuan, it is said.

### Oil Market: Rumors of Accommodation in Dalian, Raw Soybean Oil Falls Back by One Yuan

Yesterday's soybean oil market: The trend was not very changeable in the early morning because Dalian was still closed. At the opening, the market price of Dalian oil rose slightly by 1.5 cents, to 37.15 yuan. In the afternoon, it was rumored that there was a flexible solution to the issue of Dalian's controlled exports, which caused people's hearts to move. A part of the floating storage of profits urgently went out, and the market price immediately fell to 26.75 yuan. At the time of closing, it had already seen 26 yuan, down one yuan compared to the previous day's market price, with a total of more than 180 barrels traded. The other Lianqi also fell by a small amount, half a yuan, doing 30 pieces, the price was 33.5 yuan. Luhu was completed with 50 pieces, the price was 33 yuan, the marriage difference price was half, the previous day's market (26.5 yuan), 200 pieces were traded. The factory oil was still at 28.8 yuan, with 50 batches traded. Peanut oil also fell back, with the current oil falling by 5 cents and the futures oil falling by 1 yuan. It is estimated that 20 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were opened, the price was 31.5 yuan, and 50 pieces for April were completed, the price was 30 yuan. It was found that 80 pieces of raw oil came to Shanghai from Yantai yesterday, and 350 bags of beans, among the miscellaneous grains, were shipped from Tianjin yesterday.

### Silk and Tea: Sales Increase, Japanese and American Silk Prices Both Rise, Local Factory Processing Also Rises by 20-30 Yuan

Yesterday's overseas silk market: The silk price was firm because the New York raw silk statistics revealed that both imports and inventories had fallen, and sales had increased compared with the previous month. The New York Stock Exchange's near-term rose by 6 cents, and the far-term rose by 4 cents, but the spot only rebounded by 1 cent. Yokohama silk prices, both spot and forward, rose by 25 yuan. The silk market situation seemed to have stabilized considerably.

This port's silk market: Because it had been extremely weak for several days, silk sales became active yesterday as soon as the foreign market improved. Yesterday, White Factory B character seven or eight parts was traded at 1600 yuan, 20 to 30 yuan higher than the previous day. Fengtai grade was 1590 yuan, French destination Yangzhou Unprocessed Silk 1580 yuan. Suna, Xinfu, Mitsui and other firms traded more than 100 loads, and the market sentiment was greatly boosted, so the consumers also expanded accordingly. White Factory B character sold 20 loads, the price was around 1550 yuan. If the market situation can continue to be active, it will not be difficult for the domestic and foreign silk markets to turn from weak to strong.

### Piece Goods: East Goods Get Stronger, Qingdao Gang Covers Shorts in Shanghai, Huge Amounts Shipped to Sichuan and Yunnan, National Cloth Dyeing Factories Eager to Order Gray Cloth

The Sichuan-Yunnan group of National Cloth has been actively buying colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, printed satin, poplin and other goods for consecutive days, and continued to buy 4-5,000 pieces yesterday. The number of orders received was also large, but many were left in Shanghai due to insufficient cargo space on the ships. Yesterday, the rising trend of fine cloth and fine twill for white goods from the East was dramatic. In order to solve the problem of gray cloth supply for autumn and winter goods, printing and dyeing factories specially started ordering from various cloth factories at this time, but because the deadline was too far away, not many responded, and people's confidence was even stronger. The inventory of dark-colored goods such as serge, Zhigong, and thread flannel was increased by 2-3 cents per piece. Many batches have been traded by hoarders who intend to absorb them. The selling price of bleached and dyed cloth pieces was uniformly increased by 10 to 25 cents per piece. The Guangdong group bought more than 100 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and printed goods, and the purchases from this street and various guerrilla areas in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were very vast. However, there were few white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill. Affected by the East goods, the selling price became slightly stronger. More than 200 pieces of fine twill used for filling dyeing defects were purchased by various dyeing factories. 30-40 pieces of fine cloth were purchased by the Zhejiang-Fujian group, all of which were original plates. The Yantai group in the north purchased a total of 1,000 pieces of 16-pound coarse cloth last week, and there is no intention to continue purchasing, so the market has also turned flat. This street continued to have small-amount transactions.

Because of strong sales in the north, the Qingdao group covered shorts in Shanghai for fine cloth and twill from East China, with the needs for the fine cloth of Longtou and Caiqiu brands being the strongest. The market price rose due to the increased purchases, and fine cloth rose by another 3 cents per piece, and fine twill rose by 15 to 20 cents. It was also heard that Japanese manufacturers directly shipped and sold to the Nanjing-Wuhu area, with huge amounts shipped out, making the market even tighter. The color cloth Yuhao in this street also rose to search for goods, so yesterday's customer sales were about 1,500 pieces, and this street also accounted for more than 1,000 pieces. Taking advantage of this opportunity, various firms ordered a thousand pieces of fine cloth. The peak price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened from 12.4 yuan to a peak of 12.65 yuan.

### Strong Sales of Ordered Woolen Fabrics

Yesterday, the woolen fabric trading was still lively, and the retail and tailoring business for making Chinese clothing was also smooth. The business of Western clothing groups was busy in all places except for Daxin Street, which did not show special improvement. The market price, both officially and unofficially, was strong, mostly seeing only rises and never hearing of declines. Among the colleagues, the intention for ordering autumn and winter goods in the second half of the year suddenly became active, and many people selected British and Italian goods. It was heard that all autumn and winter goods in the range of 4 shillings and above to 6 shillings and below were ordered particularly strongly.

### Sugar Market: Futures Sugar Trading Still Active

Yesterday's imported sugar market continued to rise. The association's price was 25.15 yuan for Dutch coarse white ex-warehouse, and 25.25 yuan for local ex-warehouse, both up by 5 cents. Big Money brand was 25.55 yuan, transit goods were 17.05 yuan, and 200 bags were traded. Newly arrived goods were even tighter, calling up to 17.3 yuan. Taikoo refined white also rose by 2 cents, Western ex-warehouse was 25.25 yuan, and 200 bags were traded. HX brand was 24.65 yuan, 50 bags. Released for sale were June Dutch coarse white (Dutch guilder) at 8.4 yuan, July-August at 8.3 yuan, September-December at 8.05 yuan, and 800 tons were traded. Taikoo sugar in May was Hong Kong dollars 9.75 yuan, and 8,000 bags were traded, and the current month was 9.65 yuan, and 2,000 bags were traded. National Sugar Company: Transactions were still scarce. The Chao group opened 82 bags of Zhiyang, at 17 yuan, and the Min group opened thousands of bags of miscellaneous white, at 22.6 yuan, and it was heard that more than 190 bags were traded privately, but the price was not detailed.

### Paper: Tin Foil Slightly Behind, Both Retail and Wholesale Are Rising

Tin foil: Digestion was particularly strong during the Qingming Festival, with smooth sales in both wholesale stores and to inland customers. However, because the price from the producers in the Shao group was not loose, the cost was high, so the foil merchants convened a temporary meeting yesterday, proposing to raise prices. It was decided on the spot to increase the retail price by 2 cents per piece, and the whole roll would be increased by 1 to 3-4 cents, and it was decided to sell at the newly negotiated price from yesterday.

### Seafood: Black Crepe Sea Cucumber is Being Sold

Western sea cucumber, with black crepe as the best, sales are commensurate with arrivals, and the market is stable. Today, the market price of four black crepe is 430 yuan, and six is 385 yuan.

### The Rising Trend of Jianjiao Has Not Abated

The production of new Jianjiao is very poor, with an annual situation of only about 20%, resulting in rising prices in the Min market. It was found that the lowest production price was 140 yuan, and recently it has risen to 190 yuan. The Shanghai quotation must be 240 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Dark Plum is Approaching the End of the Sales Season

The selling price of dark plum in the previous market varied. For example, the price of superior goods from Shangzhuang with dry bodies and solid flesh was 14-15 yuan per load, and inferior goods were 11-12 yuan. But now that the sales season is approaching, the number of inquiries is increasing daily. It was found that inland inventory is still plentiful, and the first batch of 3-400 pieces has been prepared to be shipped to Shanghai, hoping to wait for the right time to sell.

### Sand Ginger Steadily Rises

Because the production of sand ginger was not abundant last winter, the new goods that were shipped to Shanghai were opened and sold as soon as they arrived, with no accumulation. Recently, the Tianjin group and this street have been demanding quite a lot, so the price has also been rising step by step. It is estimated that from 25 yuan to 27-28 yuan, the market price is now 30 yuan, and the future market has already called for 32 yuan, but the production price near the city is as high as 20 yuan, up 3 yuan from before.

### Hardware: The Rising Trend of New Lead Wire is Very Severe

Since the Tianjin group purchased new lead wire, spot goods are now felt to be tight, and the factory output is still scarce, so the circulating goods on the market have a situation of supply not meeting demand. The market price is rising. It was found that hundreds of loads were traded yesterday, and the selling price was increased by 1.4-5 yuan compared to the previous price. For example, No. 21 to No. 25 was sold for 29 yuan, and a single No. 25 could be sold for 31-32 yuan. Coarse flower color was sold for 25.5 yuan, and mid-range goods were opened for 23.5 yuan. However, because the inventory is weak and there are many people who need to purchase, the market is unusually prosperous.

### The Decline of Fascist Countries

— Maolie

Recent international events clearly demonstrate the decline of fascism.

Take the more advanced Italy. Its demands on France, though significantly scaled back, omitting territorial concessions and only seeking improved transit access to the Suez Canal and Djibouti port, along with better treatment for Italians in French Tunisia, have been met with France's refusal to cede an inch of land or grant any rights. Helpless, Italy has yet to take any action.

Next, consider Germany. Just a dozen days ago, it was rampaging through Central Europe, threatening to engulf all smaller, weaker nations. However, upon Britain's declaration guaranteeing Poland and forbidding aggression, Germany was forced to retreat and shelve its demands for Danzig. Although its leaders issued a speech to justify themselves, the interrupted broadcast revealed their confusion, and the words, as Londoners noted, only "confused us, not made us more troubled." The effect was predictable. This wasn't Hitler's attempt at mystification; it was, in reality, unavoidable.

Finally, there's Japan. It repeatedly saber-rattled over fishery issues with the Soviet Union, vowing never to compromise. Now, the interim fisheries agreement is complete, and Japan has gained: a 10% increase in rental fees; the return of 27 key fishing grounds to the Soviet Union; and participation in the auctions it opposed.

Why have these fascist countries become so arrogant initially, only to become deferential later? Have they achieved enough and feel content? Are they repenting and not going too far? Do they truly see the need to maintain world peace? No, no, none of that is true! They have encountered genuine resistance and have no choice but to back down.

Their consistent tactic has been to use intimidation and sow discord. In the past, they were able to operate freely and enjoy themselves because democratic nations didn't understand their nature, or, even if they did, lacked a resolute stance or coordinated action. Now, democratic nations have awakened and changed course. Their tactics of intimidation naturally fail.

Past events should inform future actions. If democratic nations uphold this spirit and continue to stand firm, the ultimate decline of fascist countries is inevitable.

China's 21 months of resistance exemplify this spirit of defying threats and resisting division. Therefore, our enemy, one of the fascist states with great ambitions for us, will inevitably face its day of ultimate decline!

### Rebellious Sons and Daughters

— Purple Gold

Before I went abroad, in Shanghai, I often saw a group of "big black men" from the territory of Durian at XX University. They were fierce, extravagant, and simple-minded, only knowing about money, cars, foreign houses, and Suzhou women... No matter the matter, big, small, black, or white, they would solve it with "crude fists." Each of them was like the "Grape" Moulis depicted by the French Louis Le Prince, three sentences not agreeing, eyes wide open, and immediately:

"Damn it!" A swarm rushed forward, "Hit him!"

In restaurants, in places with hurried and complex music, they often used alcohol to fight and get angry, staging a "Trojan War" for "sea transport." Or, if a professor didn't give them passing grades, it wasn't uncommon for them to pull out a knife to threaten him. Like this, the impression that this group of "big black men" gave people was certainly very bad. Many people even thought that everyone who grew up on the equator was this type of "only child." To put it bluntly, they were "changed things"! However, this is a big mistake, just like a group of scholars praising Shakespeare out of context. If a person has been to the equator and gotten their "overall impression" of them, then they will feel it this way.

The equator is hot, the grass is always lush, and the sun burns like fire all year round. And the Chinese sons and daughters on the equator are also so passionate, burning like fire: frank, brave, and vigorously advancing. When China, like a giant, rose up to defend against the tyrannical enemy, their strength was displayed even more fiercely and greatly, a darkness that penetrated the entire equator: "For the country," they decisively dealt with those who were afraid of airplanes and cannons, saying: "Fear the island!"

Language is their action. From Burma, from ____, from the British Malay Peninsula, from the Dutch colonies..., reserve forces flowed to suffering China in waves. In the Anti-X Military and Political University and the Shaanbei Public School, in the rescue teams, on the dusty battlefields, where was there not a trace of them? The following poem by the English poet Browning is forever worth boasting about by the Chinese sons and daughters on the equator: "I was ever a fighter, one fight more, The best and the last!" In the world, dark demons flap their wings, wreaking havoc everywhere. In J, a "bizarre" thing once happened: a middle school girl, determined to join the army, left her parents and returned to China by ship with two like-minded "big black men." When the ship arrived at ____, her relatives telegraphed the customs to detain her and the men, and then escorted them home. A group of "____" feudal remnants, wearing Taoist robes and makeup, all helped to make trouble: "Abduction and elopement, no! Sue them!" The "unjust emperors" in the newspaper offices also acted as if they knew everything, writing loudly in the newspapers: "Morals are declining, falsely enlisting in the army, seducing women to elope!"

After that, somehow, the two "big black men" were fortunately not "sued" and returned to China freely. But the middle school girl was locked up by her relatives, like the girl Psyche in Greek mythology who was imprisoned by ____ in a lonely tower, unable to move a step on her own. Even if their daughters have been domesticated into the kind of woman described in the "Goddess Fu" who is "accustomed to being quiet and secluded, far from the world," what use would they have in this era? This is a question. Parents, who were originally "stepping stones" for their children, treated their children as a swarm of flying and scurrying caterpillars, sighing to the sky: "Caterpillars, are they not afraid of being beaten to death by the XX people? Alas! Rebellious sons and daughters!"

However, the truth is that the XX people were stung to death by these caterpillars!

The rebellious sons and daughters on the equator are another source of China's national strength!

### Work

— Mei Ying

"Arise! Those who refuse to be slaves..."

Songs, flags, waving in the sweet spring breeze. The gentle sunlight shines on us walking on the shore - a small team, winding and twisting, advancing along the unfamiliar path!

Although we have been traveling for four days, we do not slack off in our work. The spirit of unity is becoming stronger and stronger. Each face, tanned black by the sun, shows a pair of stunned eyes. Three female comrades are even braver than us, distributing leaflets for national salvation along the way, singing "Women's March," causing the busy farm women to stop their work and listen to the sweet singing.

We are almost near the sea, seeing the outline of the opposite shore (Hai Mountain). We are happy, and at the same time, our stomachs are rumbling, reminding us that we will return to the sea tonight to perform a play; and we also think of the enthusiastic welcome from the local office, and the delicious food. We must do our best in the performance.

"Stop! Give the last performance in this place in front of this small house." The principal's serious face faced us, and pointed at me holding the flag, meaning for me to prepare. Everyone started working separately: applying makeup, borrowing tables and chairs, beating gongs and drums, busy for a while. The men, women, old, and young in the village all came, forming a circle. The children waited with laughter.

After I briefly reported the latest battle news from the various battlefields, a female comrade began to explain the plot of "Put Down Your Whip" and the other two short plays, so that they could easily understand. In this way, the play began.

After one act, we also interspersed speeches, singing, and individual Q&A, so that they would not feel the time was too long.

A total of three short plays were performed. They enthusiastically requested another act, so we bravely performed the stage play "Beat the XX Ghost." Some of them were in tears. They were really too moved by the characters in the play; especially those farm women, who were even more sympathetic to the farm woman in the play!

The sky gradually darkened, and a gust of sea breeze, along with a burst of enthusiastic applause, sent us to the sailing ship. We responded to them with a majestic song:

"Mobilize, mobilize, mobilize the whole country..."

### Humanity's Compassion

— Xiao Guang

The relationship between people and society is built on mutual aid and compassion. I very much believe in this sentence; but many facts that I have heard and witnessed make me doubt this famous saying.

For example: if someone falls on the road, the people on both sides will clap and laugh. A villager who has just arrived in the city and is not used to the road is hit by a car driver and almost loses his life; but the driver will not stop the car to help him up, but will scold him loudly, "You're asking for death!"

A small ____ three standing by the road catching lice, people will give him a contemptuous look. A disabled person, without feet, runs on the road, crawling hard with both hands, people do not feel tragic when they see it, but will cause a burst of laughter.

Everyone feels that robbers and thieves are hateful, and everyone will scold them. In fact, the nature of thieves and robbers is not necessarily bad, but the inadequacy of the entire social system that causes their inadequacy? Moreover, no matter what, their behavior is much better than traitors who betray national interests.

Humans should have passion, have a "heart" of compassion and mutual aid, except for those who are truly "unforgivable."

Today's Chinese people, everyone should show great compassion, but undoubtedly, this compassion has a sense of justice. Because the heart of being happy for the happiness of others and sad for the sadness of others is commendable, but it cannot be given to the enemy to fuel their ferocity, otherwise justice will be reduced in the world.

### Anti-War and Poetry

— Xu Ting

Why was poetry particularly developed in the literary world after the Three Kingdoms period? Perhaps because the world was in great chaos, and the writers and writers were either on the battlefield or displaced, they no longer had the time to bury themselves in their desks and write longer texts. However, even in that chaotic era, people's emotions did not disappear, but grew more special, full of tragic and generous enthusiasm and lingering and affectionate sadness. Therefore, this short and rich emotional poetry was greatly used and developed. Now, the whole country is fighting against the war; a great era has been opened. The literary world is arguing about the question of "why there are no great works yet"; I do not think so, I think this should be an era of great poetry creation.

According to the editor of a certain supplement, the number of poems accounts for a very large proportion of the manuscripts received by literary and artistic publications, which is also the reason; but each publication (of course, except for poetry publications) is restricted to the form of poetry accounting for one-eighth of the entire manuscript, and writers are also restricted by this, so poetry cannot be expanded. This is also the reason why modern poetry is not as developed as it was during the Three Kingdoms period.

We know that poetry is not worse than other literature and art; on the contrary, it is more convenient to write and has more emotional power. In our country, writers are naturally like the writers of the Three Kingdoms period, either on the battlefield or displaced, and even if they are temporarily settled, they are trapped in the format of ____ writing, making fierce attacks on enemies, traitors, and all corrupt elements, or popularly explaining the meaning of the war of resistance to the public. Therefore, although there are good subjects, there is no spare time to engage in the creation of great literature and art. However, the creation of poetry is still not hindered; the short form is rich in emotional expression. If these publications can break the one-eighth format, poetry will undoubtedly fly and progress.

Singing the greatness of the great era is now!

### Interesting Anecdotes from the Film Actors' Troupe's Journey to Sichuan, Silver Star Clothing Becomes the Object of Imitation, Sichuanese Men and Women Young People Make Big Jokes

— Xing Ren

The large team of film artists, after the Anti-Japanese War, was organized under the "Shanghai Film Actors' Troupe," relying on the past screen prestige, marched into Sichuan, performing national salvation dramas. At that time, it was a warm sensation in Chongqing and Chengdu, and was greatly welcomed by the audience; at the same time, in the aspect of national salvation work, it was also a powerful propaganda with great effectiveness. They stayed in Chengdu the longest; until now, there are still many people doing long-term public performances. In light of this, when they first arrived there, many young men and women in the local area followed the figures of this great era fleet step by step, imitating everything; especially in terms of clothing, which caused a lot of interesting stories.

Barefoot Leather Shoes

Bai Yang, Liu Liying, and other female stars, at that time, because the autumn heat had not subsided, many people still showed their seductive jade feet, barefoot in leather shoes, without socks. The women of Chongqing, because the world of red eyes was newly opened, took off their ____ in succession, competing to show off their fashion. Some even went further, and some fashionable women wearing ordinary shoes also did not wear socks, and quickly formed a temporary fashion.

Pom-pom Hat

A kind of child-style hat with a large pom-pom on top was originally used as a ____ hat by some male actors in the guest house. One day, someone went offstage after a performance and accidentally wore this hat to the theater a few times, and many young audience members thought it was the new popular style in Shanghai; in a few days, the city of Chengdu saw people competing to imitate it, and it became popular for a while; the young people on the streets, wearing such a hat, the colors of the hat were red, green, light, and dark, all kinds were available, which was a spectacle. The hat shops in the city also rushed to meet the market demand, and each hat was priced as high as two or three yuan, and the supply was still less than the demand, which was really an extra good business.

Ribbon Hair Tie

Bai Yang once went to a photo studio to take photos. Because she didn't have any new costumes, she suddenly had a wonderful idea and took off a belt from the velvet coat she was wearing and used it as a ribbon on her head. The large velvet balls at both ends of the belt slanted at the corners of her hair, and the appearance was also very distinctive. Later, the photo studio displayed this photo in the glass cabinet on the street, which immediately attracted the attention of many women, and everyone was busy dressing up in the same style, which became a very popular new ____ style. Even more laughable was Shi Chao's "wife" Zhuo Manli, because she wanted to take her coat belt, and the weather was cold in winter, she was still wearing a thin cheongsam. Shi Chao had no choice but to let her wear his upper garment to keep warm temporarily. Unexpectedly, once the local women discovered it, they thought it was also a very new and fashionable dress, and they all blindly followed it, not letting Zhuo Manli be the only one beautiful.

Wearing Cheongsam Outside

Similar jokes like this, in the two places, really caused a lot of trouble, to the extreme. From this point of view, the power of the film artists performing national salvation dramas is a clear counter-evidence.

Thirteenth Sister Honors New Year Gengyao Respects Teacher

In fact, discerning people knew long ago that Nian's cruelty, love of killing, arrogance and extravagance would not end well, but no one expected that he would be dealt with so quickly. It can be seen that "a tall tree attracts wind, and great power attracts jealousy" is absolutely true.

Nian Gengyao's character was so brutal, but he was extremely respectful to his teachers and elders, never daring to be negligent. In Tongshan County, Xuzhou, there was a Mr. Li, a Kangxi Zhuangyuan (top scholar), who had served as a chief examiner. Nian Gengyao was a Kangxi Jinshi (successful candidate in the imperial examination), and Li Pingyi was considered his teacher. According to local elders, Nian Gengyao always accompanied his teacher for meals. During the meal, he always watched the teacher. If he saw that the teacher liked to eat a certain dish, he would order the servants to move it in front of the teacher. If there was a grain of sand in the rice that was not cleaned, the general would glare at the servants, and the cooks would immediately suffer. One day, the cook presented a dish, and after the teacher tasted it, he found it extremely delicious, and almost emptied a small plate. Therefore, it was always presented every meal. The teacher asked what the name of this dish was, and the attendants replied "Little Tofu". One day, the dish was suddenly not seen among the dishes. The teacher was displeased and ate half a bowl less of rice. The cook was afraid of being punished by the general, so after the meal, he hurried to apologize to the teacher, saying: "These days, 'Little Tofu' is out of stock, please forgive me." The teacher was even more unhappy and said, "Tofu is not something valuable, how can it be out of stock? Isn't this obviously lying to me?" The cook was forced to tell the truth, taking the teacher to the alley in the kitchen, where he saw ducks piled up like a mountain. Pointing at these things, he said to the teacher: "The 'Little Tofu' that you eat every day is all stir-fried 'duck brains' and 'duck tongues'. It takes slaughtering several ducks a day to stir-fry a small plate. The general was afraid that if he told you in advance, you would not bear to eat it, so he always said it was 'Little Tofu', to make you happy, so you would eat well, and the general would be happy, and we would not only not be punished but also rewarded. These days, it is really difficult to find so many ducks, barely able to put together a plate to present, so it made you angry." The teacher listened, repeatedly sighed, and was so frightened that he couldn't speak for a long time. After a while, he said to the cook: "I didn't expect to eat such a big sin. From today on, I will never eat it again."

### 'Sweeping the Tomb' vs. 'Sweeping the Demons'

— Chi Qiang

The Qingming Festival is approaching, and soon it will be time to sweep the tombs, using incense, flowers, and candles to express our remembrance of our ancestors.

Although the Qingming season for sweeping tombs will arrive, what about our mourning huts (where one lives by the tomb)? Reading the line "Do not raise the dust in mourning robes, it is still possible to go home by Qingming", I can't help but shed tears!

What about our mourning huts? The tombs may have already collapsed, or become factory ruins! The demonic shadows of warmongers loom, baring their fangs and claws, seizing our fertile fields, burning our houses, raping and killing our compatriots, or even creating a vast burial ground to bury China alive, and slaughter our 450 million compatriots.

Each of us probably has a "personal tomb" around us. This tomb is created by the enemy, are we really going to walk into it? However, my heart aches! If I were to speak in a sentimental tone, of course it would be: "I was born at an inauspicious time, facing this crisis!" However, sentimentality is unnecessary. Although the "crisis" has given us "this", my life is actually very "present." Using my "present life" to save the "crisis" of "this", then even if the enemy tries their best to build burial grounds, they will not be able to pull out their own muddy feet, or at least they will only be able to deposit their own packages of "ashes".

Based on the above meaning, it seems that for the current Qingming Festival, it is not necessary to "sweep" the ancestors' "tombs", even the "remote offerings" or "remote sweeping" where souls faintly come to enjoy, as well as "representative delegation" style "sending incense" and "sending offerings" etc. can be omitted. If the ancestors truly have spirits in heaven, then at this moment of "national collapse and disintegration," they should at least understand the hardships of their descendants resisting the enemy and saving the nation, as well as the severity and urgency of all the sufferings that all living beings are enduring. Would they want their descendants to be distracted by "incense, flowers, candles, invitations to mourn and sigh" and slacken their efforts to serve the country, leading to "those close to us grieving, and the enemy rejoicing"?

Not sweeping the ancestors' tombs will not cause the ancestors to "become zombies". Not sweeping "our own tomb" will only embolden the demons and monsters to intensify their tricks and harm us. In this dark space where demons loom, if we don't fight to reclaim ourselves, how much of ourselves will be left?

Therefore, we must thoroughly examine "our own tomb" and find a way to remove and sweep clean the tomb that others have built for us.

Recently, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, wrote an article on "Seven Famous Deep-Rooted Diseases". According to her, the deep-rooted diseases are: (1) factionalism, (2) lack of self-control, (3) evading responsibility, (4) self-abandonment, (5) being careless, (6) jealousy, and (7) narrow-mindedness. Finally, she hopes that all 450 million compatriots will issue the resolute cry of "I will be reborn," and use this voice to evolve into power, arouse action, and create the "revival of our Chinese nation".

The "Seven Famous Deep-Rooted Diseases" are seven famous demons that haunt the bodies of each individual, and at any moment there is a possibility of constructing "their own tomb". If we don't find a way to sweep them away completely, we will not only fail to live up to our distant ancestors, but we will also fail to continue to grow ourselves. Moreover, the external demons lurking around us will take advantage of the opportunity of these internal demons constantly entangling us to bare their fangs and claws, devour us alive, and lead us to death, placing us in an irrecoverable abyss. Then we won't even have time to sweep "our own tomb", let alone the tombs of our ancestors.

Moreover, "The object of our filial piety today should be the entire nation, and we should strive not to fail our nation's common ancestors. We should always remember the beautiful rivers and mountains created and painstakingly managed by our ancestors who shared joys and sorrows for hundreds of generations and left to us—"

Now, many of our beautiful rivers and mountains are scorched. Therefore, changing "sweeping the tomb" to "sweeping the demons" is the most urgent and pressing task at hand. Displaced people, if you have not forgotten the beautiful rivers and mountains that our ancestors painstakingly managed and left to us! If you still want "I will be reborn"!

### Guilds and Associations

— Xin Meng

In previous years, around Qingming Festival, we would see advertisements in the newspapers from various guilds or associations urging people to "transport coffins back to their hometowns," but this year is an exception, we don't see them. Originally, in "isolated island" Shanghai, even if you wanted to transport a coffin back, it would be very troublesome.

Guilds and associations are, in fact, two entities that are one and the same. If you must distinguish between them, then guilds handle charitable affairs to benefit fellow townsmen, while associations are specifically for storing coffins. In terms of authority, it is also three-dimensional rather than two-dimensional, because associations are under the management of guilds.

Originally, of course, guilds came first, then associations, and most guilds and associations were together. Therefore, even now, in terms of name, many people still don't distinguish between them. Guilds are somewhat like foreign guilds, the so-called "trade associations." Probably after the opening of trade, Shanghai rapidly prospered, and merchants and workers from various places came to Shanghai. To seek the welfare of fellow townsmen or colleagues, they donated some money and organized guilds of the same nature as trade associations.

In general, guilds initially purchased land with the donated funds they raised. At that time, even in the concessions, there was wasteland everywhere, not yet as prosperous as it is now, so land prices were very cheap. But later, roads gradually expanded year by year, the market became more and more prosperous, and land prices rose at an astonishing rate. The value of the land purchased by the guilds also became a thousand times or more than the original price. In this way, many guilds became wealthy social organizations, and some even built houses on the vacant land they owned and rented them out to others. The rent they received was used to invest in more land, increasing their assets day by day. That depended on the chairman's skillful management.

Originally, the association was part of the guild and was merged together, but later, the population in the concessions increased year by year. In the bustling city center, storing many coffins affected hygiene and was met with disapproval from the urban authorities. Moreover, land prices rose so high that it was a pity to use valuable land for storing coffins. Therefore, the general guilds separately purchased land in Nanshi and Zhabei and built mortuaries, separating the association from the guild, and the houses and land vacated by the original association could be used for other purposes.

From then on, the guild seemed to focus on administration, specializing in providing medical treatment, dispensing medicine, providing relief to fellow townsmen, and establishing schools. When people died, they would first contact the guild, pay the fees according to the regulations, and then carry the coffin to the association for temporary storage. Indeed, for people living in Shanghai, if the coffin could not be sent back to their hometown immediately after death, only the association could solve this problem for you.

After a person died, the coffin was stored in the association. There were three levels of storage places: upper, middle, and lower. A coffin stored in a separate room was called a "large single room" or "small single room." Three to five coffins stored in one room were called a "shared room." Many coffins stored together were called a "common room." The storage fee ranged from four or five yuan to one or two hundred yuan per year. However, fellow townsmen could enjoy a discount of half the fee according to the regulations. If the fee was not paid after one year, they would transport the coffin to the public cemetery in their hometown for burial around Qingming Festival.

Since most of the associations were in Nanshi and Zhabei, and Shanghai had a war, due to the inconvenience of transportation, some guilds were forced to re-allocate part of their houses in the concessions for temporary coffin storage. The storage fee was naturally particularly high, also containing some speculative elements. At the same time, funeral homes, coffin storage places, and the like were constantly discovered and established in western Shanghai due to the association being under blockade, forming an emerging industry specifically for the bereaved families to store coffins.

—Glimpses of the Unfortunate Encounters and Happy Developments of Children—

China Children's Friendship Research Society

The society has only a dozen or so members, but their interest in research is very strong. Their works are often published in various children's newspapers. Now, it has merged with the Children's Friendship Literary Society, and has established general affairs and communication departments to manage the society's affairs, as well as science and literary groups to lead research.

Children's New Reading Club

The club was founded in 1937, originally located in Hongkou. After August 13th, the club's books were all destroyed by artillery fire. Now, they are re-collecting books, with more than 400 children's books available for members to borrow. There are currently seven members, all around the age of thirteen.

(3) Undertakings Regarding Child Education

Wartime Children's Shelter

In the various refugee shelters in Shanghai, refugee children account for a large number. In addition, there is also a wartime children's shelter dedicated to housing refugee children. The shelter is located at the St. John's YMCA Middle School and houses about 650 children, ranging in age from five to thirteen or fourteen. Most of them are orphans rescued from the war zone, and some are sent by residents of nearby slums for foster care. The shelter is established by the Chinese Child Welfare Association.

Street Children's Vocational Training Institute

The institute is located on Xiamen Road and was opened by the Shanghai International Relief Committee in mid-June last year. It currently offers handicrafts such as bamboo work, carpentry, shoemaking, towel making, patching, tailoring, and weaving, and also provides elementary education. Children are divided into two groups: those who study and those who learn skills. One group attends classes and the other group works, alternating in shifts. The current number of residents is 110.

Shanghai Relief Refugee Children's Training Institute

The institute raises refugee children aged four to fourteen, providing them with education. It is currently renting land on Wuding Road and building its own houses, so that it can house as many refugee children as possible to achieve the purpose of universal relief.

Beggar Children's Training Institute

The Shanghai Child Welfare Association is planning to establish a beggar children's training institute to house beggar children, provide them with strict guidance, and teach them appropriate education and life skills, so that they can become self-reliant in society in the future. The institute is currently in preparation and will be established soon.

(4) Emerging Children's Education Undertakings

Refugee Children's Education

The refugee shelters established by various charitable organizations in Shanghai number 221. Initially, each shelter automatically organized children's education classes, but later, the Chinese Red Cross Society invited 19 members to form an education committee to manage refugee children's education. A total of 14,560 children are being educated, with 383 teachers. The curriculum is divided into five subjects: Chinese, arithmetic, general knowledge, and physical education. Classes are taught for more than two hours a day, and the curriculum is the same as that of ordinary primary schools.

Street Children's Education

The Shanghai Street Children's Education Association is implementing street children's education. In the past year, it has opened 153 street children's education classes, educating 6,248 children. It is now divided into eight districts, with four classes in each district, totaling 32 classes. Each class is taught for two hours a day. There are 1,456 children enrolled and 54 teaching staff. Recently, a mobile library box has been added, which rotates daily to each district to provide general street children with after-school reading.

Newsboy Education

The Shanghai Child Welfare Association has founded 10 newsboy schools, with more than 500 newsboys enrolled. Now, 11 more schools have been added, totaling 21 schools, of which 14 have already opened. The work outline is divided into two categories: teaching and health. The funds were raised by Chen Hecheng, the chairman of the association, for more than 800 yuan, and the Shen Bao newspaper donated 300 yuan.

Compulsory Education

The Shanghai Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Institute provides relief to out-of-school children, taking responsibility for education expenses and sending them to various primary schools to study. The China Circulation Library founded a free primary school, enrolling poor children, charging no tuition fees, and providing books and stationery. The Hudong Commune runs four free night schools for apprentices, specializing in recruiting apprentices from shops and small factories, providing free education.

Scientific Experiments

In order to promote children's science and impart various manufacturing techniques to children, the Shanghai YMCA has established a children's science laboratory on Sichuan Road, divided into five groups: biology, physics, chemistry, mechanics, and woodworking. Each group conducts experiments for two days a week, three hours each time. Each group lasts for two months, and each person pays three yuan per term, including experiments and lecture notes.

The telegram from the two Miss He's arrived in Beiping, and within three days, they received a quick letter from Mr. He. The letter said: "I have been in Beiping for several days. The contract for barter trade, using our country's tea to exchange for Soviet oil, has also been signed and published. I think you have seen it in the newspapers. In addition, there are several international trade events that are being negotiated. We also want to imitate the method of barter trade with the Soviet Union for the soybeans of the three northeastern provinces, exchanging them for their machinery and pigments with Germany. Therefore, I must go to the three northeastern provinces." The letter also said: "In the past, you two sisters had the intention of establishing a textile factory in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. We have not discussed it in detail. Now, in Beiping, I met two friends from Jiangsu and Zhejiang and talked to them about it, and they were very happy. They advocate starting a silk weaving factory first, which can do foreign trade business. According to them, Europeans and Americans like Chinese silk products very much. In the past, when European and American giant ships arrived in Shanghai, they would definitely buy a lot of Chinese silk fabrics. They said: Chinese silk products are much better than Japanese ones, and they are willing to buy Chinese goods. Unfortunately, Chinese silk merchants adhere to old methods, do not think about improvements, only sell domestically, and are unwilling to do Western-style business. Now they are very ambitious in this regard, but unfortunately, they lack the textile expertise. I mentioned you two briefly, and they were extremely happy to hear that you studied textiles in the United States. As for capital, they don't worry about it. They said they can raise one million yuan and let me take 20%. This is not a problem, but are you happy to do it? I often hear you say that after returning to China, you must have a career. But the career must be one that you are happy to do and confident in. If what you use is not what you have learned, then it is meaningless. Looking back, our country's raw silk exports have been in a slump. When we were in the United States, we investigated the raw silk they used, and those from Japan accounted for 70%. The remaining 30% was supplied by our country, France, and Italy. It is a pity that our country, which originally ranked first in sales to the United States, has fallen to such a level. Later, Japan specialized in aggression, and people went out to be soldiers, and the number of silkworm farmers gradually decreased. In addition, various countries boycotted Japanese goods and stopped using Japanese raw silk. American female students were even unwilling to wear silk stockings. Japanese raw silk fell drastically year after year. Now, Japanese raw silk accounts for only 25% of the raw silk used in the United States, while raw silk sold to the United States has jumped to 65%. This can be considered the recovery of our raw silk exports, but we must strive not only for raw materials but also for finished products." (79)
