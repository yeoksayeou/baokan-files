### British Government Sends Strong Protest to Japan: Does Not Recognize Changes Made by Force; Konoe and Arita's Repeated Declarations Seen as Attempt to Dominate China; British Side Expresses Serious Concern and Resolves to Abide by the Nine-Power Treaty

(London) Today, it was officially announced here that the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, presented a note to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday. The note, in strong language, expressed the British government's serious concern regarding Japan's policy toward China. The note clearly stated that Britain adheres to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and mentioned that the British government has studied the declarations of Japanese politicians, such as the Konoe statements of November 3rd and December 22nd, and Arita's remarks to reporters on December 19th, which outlined Japan's new policy toward the Far East situation, and has serious doubts and concerns. These concerns have not been alleviated by the British Ambassador's meeting with the Japanese Foreign Minister. The British government understands that the Japanese government's intention is to establish a "Japan-China-Manchukuo Triangular Bloc," with Japan occupying a position of superiority, and China and Manchukuo both subordinate to Japan. As far as China is concerned, it is said that the Japanese government at least intends to use the "Asia Development Board" to implement control over China in the near future. The "Asia Development Board" is responsible for formulating and implementing policies concerning China's politics, economy, and culture. Arita's remarks to reporters indicated that the aim of the triangular bloc is to form an economic unit, and that the economic activities of other countries must be subject to the restrictions dictated by the bloc's defense needs and economic security. According to the Konoe declaration, the war against China will continue until the Chinese government is shattered or agrees to accept Japanese conditions and join the bloc. Furthermore, China must conclude an anti-communist agreement with Japan, and Japanese troops will be stationed in designated locations within China indefinitely, presumably to guarantee the fulfillment of Japan's armistice terms. In addition, Konoe declared that Inner Mongolia should be treated as a special anti-communist zone. The British government, lacking more detailed information, can only assume that Inner Mongolia will be subject to Japanese military control to an even greater extent than other parts of China. The British government truly does not understand how Konoe's guarantee that Japan does not want to occupy Chinese land and intends to respect Chinese sovereignty can be reconciled with the Japanese government's declared intention to force the Chinese people to accept its conditions. These conditions would subject China's political, economic, and cultural life to Japanese control, maintain a large number of Japanese troops stationed in China indefinitely, and effectively separate Inner Mongolia from China. The British government wishes to declare that Britain is not prepared to accept or recognize changes brought about by force. Britain will adhere to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and cannot endorse unilateral changes to its provisions. Before the outbreak of this war, the beneficial effects that the treaty could have hoped to achieve were being gradually realized. (The note is not finished; the remaining text of the telegram has not arrived and will be continued tomorrow morning.) (Reuters, 15th)

(London) Following the presentation of the note by British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to the Japanese government yesterday, the Sunday Times commented, "Japan is determined to close the Chinese market and exclude Western countries. What applies to Britain and the United States also applies to Germany and Italy." The note presented by the British government yesterday used firm language to explain Britain's attitude toward this policy. The firmness of its wording is almost unprecedented since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Its content states that any action to unilaterally amend existing treaties will be firmly rejected by Britain, but does not oppose discussing amendments through negotiations. In other words, Britain has adopted the same policy as the United States. Although the content of the British note is not identical to the note presented by the US government to Japan last December, the principles on which they are based are the same. In addition, although the British note does not imply that retaliatory measures will be taken against Japan, this measure has indeed been studied by the relevant departments of the Foreign Office and is not entirely impossible. However, in the short term, it does not seem that such strong action will be considered." (Havas, 15th)

Editorial

### Wang Jingwei's Conditions

The Wang Jingwei affair need not be discussed again. However, in the past few days, newspapers have continued to report on it, and there are still points that are difficult to remain silent about, so I will elaborate further. For example, the Chongqing telegram on the 10th stated: Because Wang's telegram was still moderate in tone and had no active betrayal, the central government will temporarily remain silent and wait and see. Readers who are concerned about the overall situation then ask whether there is a way for the central government and Wang to gradually negotiate; this is the first point. Another example is the Tokyo telegram on the 14th: Wang's confidant in Hong Kong stated that Wang is still determined to negotiate peace with the Japanese side based on the following conditions: (1) resolutely oppose communism, (2) conclude a Sino-Japanese anti-communist agreement, (3) the country cooperates with Germany and Italy, (4) China and Japan closely cooperate in political, economic, and cultural aspects. Readers who are concerned about the overall situation then ask whether we will actually have negotiations with Japan through Wang; this is the second point. Another example is the Hong Kong telegram on the 14th: Wang intends to strive to obtain the support of the Chinese army and Kuomintang leaders to conclude an honorable peace with Japan, and his followers have been ordered to set up an office in Hong Kong to guide the peace movement. Readers who are concerned about the overall situation ask about Wang's potential, and also worry about his conspiracies; this is the third point. There are even those with muddled minds and wavering wills who think that it is better to be lenient with his punishment and sit and watch his success or failure, perhaps there is a shortcut to follow?

As far as we know, the central government's attitude towards the war of resistance is strong and unwavering, and no rhetoric or coercion can shake it. It deeply abhors Wang Jingwei's words and deeds this time; but after expelling him from the party and removing him from his position, although all parties have requested the most severe punishment, the central government has not taken further action, not because it still has expectations for Wang. If Wang turns back at this point and carries thorns to plead guilty, how the central government will deal with it is certainly unknown, but to say that the central government, in its capacity as the authority over the entire nation, would still have so-called negotiations with a fickle, law-breaking, and discipline-breaking person is not appropriate and will certainly not happen. The reason for observing silently after Wang's telegram is only to see whether there is any active act of betrayal, and not to have any other expectations. If Wang continues in his stubbornness, running counter to morality, he will only lead a few lackeys in areas with fewer overseas Chinese, and live his life of a fool dreaming, to end his remaining years. But looking at the Tokyo side's attitude since Wang's telegram was issued, they treat him with indifference; how could it be said that Wang's disillusionment is getting closer and closer, and instead take him as a negotiating partner for peace? Japan is truly in a dilemma, experiencing the sorrow of doing many unjust things and wanting to stop but being unable to. However, to transform itself and leave, it has its own puppets to use as tools, and Wang is not its choice. Some say that there are people in Shanghai who are running around for Wang, and the Japanese seem to be colluding with them, how can we know that this is not the beginning of peace talks? This statement is fundamentally unlikely to be credible, and fraud is a common phenomenon in the political market; those who collude with each other will end up with just virtual collusion. Even if they are colluding, at most it is only a puppet problem, not a peace problem.

Only Wang knows that his own body is not valued by others. Therefore, the so-called efforts to obtain support and lead the movement are all weak and final struggles that he subjectively feels are necessary. Although Wang cannot lure people, who would be lured by him? It is often heard that Wang was assassinated in Beijing in the past because his old subordinates resented Wang for his own honor and abandoning his group of people, and someone was angry and took this action; the lessons of the past can be learned, and his credibility has fallen to the ground. Now, after betraying the party and the country, what can he rely on to appeal to others? Taking a step back, some may hear his so-called conditions and his so-called honorable peace, and cannot help but be moved; not only wavering and sitting and watching his success or failure, but also feeling the temporary and personal pain of the war, and being optimistic about his success. Then try to examine his conditions; as for communism and anti-communism, the doctrine of belief cannot be forced to be the same; however, the sincere unity under the banner of the war of resistance stems from a strong national consciousness that is innate, and also recognizes the interests of the nation for generations to come, which transcends doctrine; even if one is dissatisfied with communism, China is not a communist China, who would be willing to surrender to the enemy because of dissatisfaction with communism? As for Germany and Italy, China values loyalty and forgiveness, so things like recognizing Manchukuo, withdrawing advisors, and despising envoys, China has endured to this extreme, in order to maintain its original diplomatic relations; when Wang was in the central government, he could not improve Germany and Italy's prejudices, and now he still takes cooperation as a condition for dealing with Japan, does this have any meaning? Taking another step back, in Wang's telegram, although we criticized it as wrong in the past, we once praised the withdrawal of troops as the most pleasing to hear; we only pointed out its absurdity because Wang mentioned it in the same breath as other conditions; but what about now? The four grand conditions do not mention the withdrawal of troops; isn't this more evidence of the incoherence of Wang Jingwei's thought?

### Intense Air Battle Over Chongqing: Fierce Fighting for Forty Minutes, One Japanese Plane Shot Down, Over 300 Civilians Killed or Wounded, Blood and Flesh Everywhere, Japanese Planes Also Attacked Guilin and Tongguan

(Chongqing) Today, more than twenty Japanese planes appeared over Chongqing, attacking the eastern district. This was the first determined attack since the Nationalist Government moved here. The Japanese planes arrived in the afternoon and were immediately met with intense anti-aircraft fire. Chinese fighter planes also took off to engage them. According to unverified reports, one Japanese bomber was damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Chongqing residents reported seeing one Japanese plane trailing thick smoke. Other eyewitnesses also said that anti-aircraft fire damaged one Japanese plane. Today's attack focused on the northeast of the city and areas along both banks of the Jialing River. Many people were killed or wounded. Chinese fighter planes charged into the Japanese bomber formation, strafing them with machine guns. Onlookers on the ground heard the sound of the machine guns. Rescue teams rushed through the city, carrying the wounded to various hospitals on stretchers. Many of the wounded had injuries to their hands, and some had arms and legs severed by bomb fragments. At 1:30 PM, the air raid alarm suddenly sounded, as more than thirty Japanese planes were seen following the south bank of the Yangtze River upstream. An emergency air raid alarm was issued here when the Japanese planes passed Fuling. At that time, only six Japanese bombers could be seen from the ground, advancing in two formations. It was reported that the Minsheng Company pier at Chaotianmen was bombed, resulting in many deaths and injuries among the dock coolies. If Chongqing is subjected to heavy bombing, the casualties are feared to be horrifying, as the city is densely populated and there is no open space to escape in case of fire. It was reported that the Chongqing airfield was not bombed in this attack. Today, most of the bombs fell on the north bank of the Jialing River, so authorities expect many casualties on the north bank. Six bombs fell on the south bank, killing twelve and wounding twenty. Several bombs fell on the western suburbs. Although there are government offices in the area, the bombs all fell in open spaces or in the middle of the road, so there were few casualties. As late as tonight, the wounded were still being transported to the Canadian Hospital. There were many women among them. Hundreds of relatives and friends of the wounded gathered outside the hospital, inquiring about their condition. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

(Chongqing) The weather in Chongqing was clear today. At 12:20 PM, the air raid alarm sounded. At 1:00 PM, thirty-six Japanese bombers, escorted by forty fighter planes, attacked Chongqing.

The fighting lasted for forty minutes. The air raid alarm was lifted at 2:00 PM. The worst hit area was the Chaotianmen pier, where statistics indicate that two hundred civilians were killed or wounded on the shore due to the explosion of several 300-pound bombs. Five civilian boats were also sunk in the Yangtze River, killing one hundred and fifty people. They originally thought that the river surface was the safest place during an air raid, but unexpectedly suffered this tragedy. After the bombing of Chaotianmen, blood flowed everywhere, and the situation was extremely tragic. Many of the wounded were sent to hospitals for treatment. The results of today's air battle have not yet been officially announced. It is rumored that the bombs dropped by Japanese planes in the western suburbs were far from their targets.

(Chongqing) Yesterday afternoon, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, spoke to Chinese women's groups in Chongqing, saying that China cannot and does not want to negotiate peace with Japan, which seeks to enslave the Chinese people. I have accompanied Chairman Chiang on inspections of various front lines.

Only in the rear have I heard suggestions for peace negotiations among a few weak people lacking courage and confidence.

However, due to extremely poor road conditions, transportation is difficult, making it impossible to maintain a sufficient coal supply. It is rumored that there is hope of restoring the power supply tomorrow, but there is no guarantee. Although the Japanese military authorities have fulfilled their promise to supply the Hankou Power Company with 1,000 tons of coal per month, they apparently find it quite difficult, as ships coming to Hankou are fully loaded with goods and military supplies.

### Wu Dingchang Scheduled to Return to Guizhou Today

Kunming: Wu Dingchang has completed his discussions with Chairman Long in Yunnan on important political matters related to Yunnan and Guizhou and is scheduled to return to Guizhou by car on the morning of the 16th. (Dispatch of the 15th)

### Wu Tiecheng Arrives in Chongqing to Report to the Central Government

Chongqing: After personally handling the handover of the provincial government in Lianxian on the 13th, Wu Tiecheng took the route through Hunan and Guizhou to Sichuan with Ouyang Ju and others, arriving in Chongqing on the afternoon of the 15th. According to Wu, he has come here specifically to report to the central government. I was ordered to return to Guangdong to preside over the provincial government, but before three months had passed, we entered a state of emergency. Although I have done my best to deal with matters related to the rear during the war of resistance, due to my limited abilities, I have failed to live up to the expectations of the central government and all parties, which I deeply regret. The enthusiasm of the people of Guangdong for the war of resistance has remained consistent. They have always supported the central government, loved and respected the leader, and obeyed the government's orders. In addition to contributing their efforts, they have been willing to sacrifice and strengthen their self-defense, which is sufficient to strengthen the military's strength. (Dispatch of the 15th)

### Islamic Near East Delegation, Wang Zengshan and Others Return to Kunming, Will Soon Go to Chongqing to Report

Kunming: The Chinese Islamic Near East Delegation, Wang Zengshan and five others, arrived in Kunming today from Turkey via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. According to Wang, the delegation departed from Hong Kong in January of last year, representing the country's Muslims in visiting Near East countries, promoting China's war of resistance and the true situation of Muslim compatriots on the front lines, and exposing Japan's various deceptive propaganda in the Near East. They traveled through India, Arabia, Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Iran, and other places, and received deep sympathy from local authorities and people, who believed that China's current arduous struggle had built a foundation for revival, similar to Turkey's revival. Near Eastern peoples are united and struggling on their own, and the brutal Japanese will inevitably be destroyed. It is said that the delegation members will rest briefly in Yunnan and then return to Chongqing to report on their experiences. (Dispatch of the 12th)

### The Ministry of Finance Refuses to Approve Further Accommodation for the Request by the Inspector General of Customs to Overdraw and Repay Debts Guaranteed by Customs Revenue, Because Japanese Troops Have Seized Customs Revenue, Making It Impossible to Repay Debts, and It Would Be Unfair to Subsidize Them for a Long Time

Chongqing: The Ministry of Finance has issued the following notice regarding debt repayment methods: The government has always fulfilled its debt repayment obligations on schedule, especially for debts and indemnities guaranteed by customs revenue, which have never been overdue. In the past, due to natural disasters, man-made disasters, and global economic crises, when there were tax revenue shortfalls and insufficient funds to allocate, the government repeatedly transferred and subsidized large sums to maintain creditworthiness and protect the interests of creditors, paying on schedule. All these efforts have long been recognized by both Chinese and foreign parties. Unexpectedly, since the Japanese invasion, they have seized customs revenue in the war zone, using our financial resources as a tool to invade us, and have used all kinds of deceitful and coercive tactics to deposit all customs revenue for debts guaranteed by customs in Japanese banks. The amount of debt that should have been allocated and not paid by the various customs in the war zone, which the government has transferred and allowed the Central Bank to overdraw and subsidize, has accumulated to a huge sum of 175 million yuan. In order to maintain domestic and foreign creditworthiness and protect the interests of creditors, the government has continued to pay on schedule despite incurring huge additional burdens. The Japanese have also forced the use of Japanese puppet banknotes and military scrip in the war zone, attempting to disrupt our financial system and reduce legal customs revenue. However, the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness has never wavered. The Central Bank has provided the required foreign exchange for customs debt repayment in full. All these measures demonstrate that the government has made its utmost efforts to protect the interests of creditors. However, at present, customs revenue in the war zone is being seized by Japanese forces and deposited in Japanese banks. Although nominally deposited, it is actually being used to seize our foreign exchange and increase their aggressive power. Therefore, the deposited funds are originally the tax revenue deposits of our customs commissioners, but they are not remitted as required. Their infringement of the rights and interests of friendly countries and the interests of Chinese and foreign creditors is undeniable. Under these circumstances, the government cannot but take appropriate measures. Therefore, the Inspector General of Customs' recent request for continued overdraft to repay debts has not been approved, and it has been ordered to allocate and pay from the tax revenue deposited in the relevant customs. In the future, for all long-term debts guaranteed by customs that were borrowed before the war and have not yet been cleared, the amount that should be allocated in proportion to the tax revenue of the various customs outside the war zone shall be transferred to the Central Bank on schedule for special storage. However, this method of proportional storage is only a temporary measure to cope with the current extraordinary situation. If the various customs in the war zone transfer the previously stored and unpaid indemnity payments to the Inspector General of Customs as before, the government will naturally continue to allocate the debt fund as before at the same time to restore the pre-war situation.

### Major Naval Exercises by the Three Major Democratic Nations of Europe and America, Britain and France Focus on the Atlantic and Mediterranean, US Warships Concentrate in the Panama Canal

(Paris) The French Navy is scheduled to hold exercises starting on the 18th of this month, focusing on protecting the communication lines between mainland France and its North African territories, as well as in the Atlantic Ocean. Coincidentally, the British Home Fleet is also maneuvering in both the Atlantic and Mediterranean during its spring cruise. The fact that Britain and France attach particular importance to freedom of navigation in the western Mediterranean and Atlantic during wartime, and recognize it as a current issue, can be seen from this move. According to the planned schedule, the French Mediterranean Fleet will patrol the coast of North Africa and conduct exercises in Tunisian waters, while the Atlantic Fleet will conduct exercises in the waters of the Azores and then sail to the port of Casablanca in French Morocco, North Africa, to join the Mediterranean Fleet. In addition, several French submarines will cross the Atlantic after the exercises and sail to the West Indies in the Americas, so that it will echo the example of the German submarine "Deutschland" sailing to Boston Harbor in the United States during the European War. French naval figures also said that because all countries have built submarines with great endurance, the situation in the Atlantic has changed. When the European situation was tense last September, Germany sent a submarine to the Atlantic for trial navigation, but it was abandoned halfway due to its low tonnage and insufficient endurance. This is why the German government asked Britain and Germany to increase the tonnage of submarines so that they could build submarines with greater endurance. The Atlantic Ocean is the meeting point of the traffic lines of all countries in the world to India, one being the Suez Canal, the second being the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and the third being the Panama Canal, all of which must pass through the Atlantic Ocean. At present, the US Navy is conducting exercises near the Panama Canal, while the British and French navies are conducting exercises in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, that is, on the two traffic lines of the Suez Canal and the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and the significance of this is worth pondering. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

(Paris) It is announced from this question that General Gamelin, Chief of Staff of the French Army, and Admiral D'Arhall are now taking leave of absence. They are scheduled to go to North Africa on the 19th of this month to inspect Volan, Mousseclebury, Archilly, and the coast of Morocco. Admiral Dabha will go to Dakar after the inspection. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

(London) The Navy Department has recently released part of the program for the Home Fleet's spring cruise to the western Atlantic and Mediterranean. It is said that the participants include one aircraft carrier, the "Royal Oak," five cruisers, about twenty destroyers, five submarines, one repair ship, and ten auxiliary ships (including one aviation training carrier, the "Valiant"). The above warships are scheduled to depart from the Home Fleet on the 17th of this month and arrive at Gibraltar between the 23rd and 25th. Several of them will also visit various French ports. The outside world does not yet know what the second part of the cruise program will be. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

Panama: The US fleet has been passing through the Panama Canal in succession for the past two days and is expected to have passed through it completely last night, so that it can start alternate drills in the Atlantic from February 13th. The last ship sailed out of Balboa yesterday morning, and commercial traffic on the Pacific side of the Panama Canal was restored yesterday morning. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

(Washington) The Navy Department said today that after completing exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea, 113 US warships will visit various countries in Central and South America to show the strength of the US Navy. Although the dates of the visits have not yet been determined, the Caribbean Sea exercises are expected to be completed by early April. The places to be visited include Haiti, Puerto Rico, the Windward Islands, Martinique, the Virgin Islands, Cuba, Santo Domingo, Jamaica, Saint Kitts, Trinidad, and the Dutch West Indies. After the visits, they will return to the US naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba, to conduct gunnery exercises. Also, 80 to 90 ships of the Pacific Fleet, which have already passed through the Panama Canal, will gather with the Atlantic Fleet at the Guantanamo naval base. It is said that this joint exercise will involve 200 warships, 200 aircraft, and 150,000 naval personnel. (Associated Press dispatch, 15th)

### France Increases Production of Military Aircraft, Minister of Aviation Announces Production of 200 Aircraft Per Month

(Paris) Minister of Aviation La Chambre recently gave a speech to the press, explaining the reorganization of the French aircraft manufacturing industry and the recruitment of air force pilots and mechanics. He said that since June 15th of last year to September 15th, the government has added new equipment to the nationalized aircraft factories, and the total cost of mass production is 1,846,000,000 francs. In addition, a special factory has been set up to design various new models. As for the number of aircraft manufactured, the average number of military aircraft produced last year has increased from 41 to over 80. These aircraft are also the latest models, and their quality is two-to-one compared to the past. However, during the reorganization period, the manufacturing capacity of the factories could not be fully developed, so several aircraft were ordered from foreign countries to make up for the shortfall. Although only 80 military aircraft can be manufactured by the factories this month, it is hoped that the number can be increased to over 200 after the start of spring. As of now, only three of the six state-owned aircraft factories are manufacturing military aircraft, and the other three factories will be converted to military aircraft in a short period of time. At the same time, three private factories are also being reorganized. In this way, the manufacturing capacity of the country's factories can easily be doubled in the coming months. In addition, the number of trainer aircraft has increased from only 380 in 1937 to 1,000 last year. The number of mechanics who passed the exam last year was 860, which can be increased to 3,800 this year. The number of non-paid radio operators who passed the exam was 40 last year, which can be increased to 300 this year. The number of military aircraft pilots who passed the exam was 130 last year, which can be increased to 413 this year. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Great Anxiety About the Future of the European Situation, Hitler Has Subtly Revealed His Plans for Action This Year to the Polish Foreign Minister

London: Many correspondents from Sunday newspapers have recorded the details of the recent meeting between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Hitler. The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent said that the meeting was crucial because the two men had stated their opinions and Hitler had slightly revealed his plans for 1939. Hitler assured Beck that he did not want to forcibly resolve the Danzig or Memel issues in the near future, nor did he want to force Poland to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. He also had nothing to do with the unrest in Ukraine. Hitler said that the Soviet Union would "split" in two or three years, and that he intended to intervene when the time was ripe. However, the general theme of the conversation focused on the colonial issue. Hitler meant that Poland should immediately put forward its own colonial demands. Hitler gave Beck the impression that he was willing to convene a colonial conference with his own conditions before the end of the year. An Observer correspondent in Warsaw reported that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was originally scheduled to visit Warsaw in early March to return the visit, but due to the new situation caused by Hungary's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact and the Czech Republic's intention to follow suit, he plans to visit Warsaw at the end of this month. Also, a Sunday Times correspondent in Warsaw reported that the opinion of the diplomatic community there is that the Franco-Polish alliance is now in a precarious state. A prominent politician said that only divine power can save it. The Polish official newspaper Polska also said that we should now regard the Franco-Polish alliance as if it does not exist. The correspondent also said that before Ribbentrop returns the visit to Warsaw, Hitler's confidant, General Goering, will visit Warsaw next week. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### Germany Does Not Forget: Recovers Territory; Hitler and Polish Foreign Minister Discuss Distribution Plan

(London) Well-informed sources in Central European countries here have recently declared that when German Führer Hitler recently spoke with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, he touched upon the issue of colonies. Germany intends not only to recover its old colonies but also to ensure a colonial empire commensurate with Germany's national strength. In other words, it should be even larger than any other country's colonial empire. Furthermore, considering Britain's current national strength, the British Empire is indeed too large. Therefore, the current colonies should be redistributed within a short period, with a portion given to countries with overpopulation, such as Poland. In return, Poland would cede a portion of its territory to Germany. If this were to happen, all pending issues between Germany and Poland could be resolved at once, and Poland could also receive compensation in terms of colonies. However, Führer Hitler did not involve France. A certain person in political circles here recently commented on this news, saying that Germany's aircraft production averages 600 per month. Once the country's submarine tonnage is on par with Britain's, it will be able to blockade the British coast and intercept British merchant ships. Germany's intention is to deal with the British Empire, as can be seen from this. (Havas, 14th)

(London) When German Führer Hitler met with Colonel Beck, the discussion was almost entirely limited to the colonial issue and the plan drafted by Führer Hitler. British officials, upon hearing the news, have taken it seriously. The Sunday Dispatch recently stated that Führer Hitler is drafting a colonial redistribution plan that is highly unfavorable to Britain. According to this plan, Poland, in exchange for not hindering Germany's expansion into Eastern Europe, especially the establishment of a Greater Ukraine, would receive a share in the colonial redistribution. Italy would also acquire some land. However, Foreign Minister Beck did not agree to accept any binding conditions, and the two sides decided to discuss the matter again in the spring of this year. Nevertheless, Führer Hitler's plan has put Poland in a difficult position. The plan to establish a Ukrainian state is something that Poland dares not openly support, nor does it wish to pursue an anti-British policy. While acquiring colonies is something Poland would like to hear, the prospect of realization is still remote, and the Eastern European issue is of more immediate concern. As for the current situation, Führer Hitler had previously given Prime Minister Chamberlain a promise not to raise the colonial issue within one or two years. This promise is still valid. However, Führer Hitler may employ a tactic similar to the one he used last year. In other words, he will simultaneously raise demands regarding expansion into Eastern Europe and the colonial issue, and then choose one to pursue. (Havas, 15th)

### Japan Again Uses Empty Threats Against Soviet Russia: Says Will Sever Diplomatic Relations If Fishing Issue Not Resolved by April

(Tokyo) According to reliable news received today by the Associated Press, unless Soviet Russia accepts Japan's demands and resolves the long-disputed fishing issue, Japan is prepared to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Japanese military officials believe that the Soviet Union will not accept the challenge. It is said that if the fishing case is not resolved satisfactorily by April, when the fishing season begins, Japan's plan will be implemented. At that time, if a Japan-Soviet agreement is still not established, Japanese fishing boats will sail to the north under armed escort to continue fishing. Japanese officials believe that it would be best for Japan to take action before the Soviet Union, recall its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigenori Togo, and then decide on a response based on the Soviet Union's actions. Furthermore, the Tokyo military leaders believe that the Soviet Union is currently preoccupied with the Ukrainian issue to cope with Germany and would not want to lightly start a war with Japan.

### Ferocity of Spanish Fighting Unprecedented Since Start of WWI: Nationalist Forces' Intense Artillery Fire and Fierce Air Raids; Government Forces Retreating, Situation Increasingly Tense

Lerida. It is expected that Tarragona, a seaport 45 miles southwest of Barcelona, will be occupied by Nationalist forces tonight. On the central Catalan front, Nationalist forces have entered Barcelona province near Coroma. On the southern front, Nationalist forces yesterday not only occupied Valls, 12.5 miles from Tarragona, but also advanced to a point less than 9 miles from Reus, the government forces' center of ammunition production in Tarragona province. Meanwhile, on the northern front, Nationalist forces have occupied positions within 6 miles of Sivella. It has been four weeks since General Franco led his troops across the lower Segre River on a cold night, and the Nationalist forces now control most of the new province. According to military observers, the intensity of artillery fire in some areas, coupled with aerial bombardment, is unprecedented in any European battle. It is reported that the government forces have suffered a total of 25,000 casualties in this area, including 50 prisoners. (Reuters, 15th)

Lerida. The Nationalist forces' fifth division of Seville entered Tarragona at 3:30 PM. (Reuters, 15th)

Burgos. The Nationalist government has issued a war report stating that Nationalist forces on the Catalan front have occupied the city of Tarragona. The city is an important strategic location on the Mediterranean coast. (Havas, 15th)

Saragossa. Nationalist forces advanced 10 kilometers on the Catalan front today and have entered Barcelona province near the city of Coroma (65 kilometers from the suburbs of Barcelona). On the southern front, Nationalist forces have also captured the key points of Valls and Alcover. (Havas, 14th)

Barcelona. According to a government forces' communiqué issued today, fierce fighting is taking place near Valls. Nationalist forces suffered heavy losses in the Agramunt area, and their advance has been halted. There has been no news here regarding the progress of the government forces' offensive on the Madrid and Extremadura fronts. (Reuters, 15th)

Barcelona. The situation in the city has become increasingly tense after the advance troops of the Nationalist forces entered Barcelona province. Conscripts marched in teams through the main thoroughfares before heading to the front lines. Many women and children gathered in front of the barracks to bid farewell to the conscripts. Slogans were posted throughout the city, all calling for resistance. (Havas, 14th)

Barcelona. The Spanish government has issued an order that all male and female citizens between the ages of 17 and 55 can be conscripted by the government to perform necessary work. This general mobilization plan includes an order to call up reserve soldiers from 1915 to 1921, which will add at least 350,000 soldiers to the front lines, half of whom will come from Catalonia, a densely populated province. (Reuters, 15th)

(Paris) The Executive Committee of the World Anti-War and Anti-Fascist Congress issued a declaration today, calling on people of all countries to "actively assist the Spanish Republican government and concentrate efforts to resist Fascism." (Havas, 15th)

(Rome) French newspapers have fiercely criticized demonstrations held in France in support of the Spanish Republic. The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia stated that this is a dangerous move and that French interference in the Spanish civil war has not stopped. It is an organized conspiracy that endangers the political and national freedom of Spain and threatens the current situation in the Mediterranean, which cannot be changed. Italy is determined to maintain it by all means. Accordingly, Italy and all of Europe should pay close attention to France's actions regarding Spain. European nations that do not want the Soviet Union to exert its influence on the Spanish Republican government will not allow arrogant imperialism to do as it pleases without being stopped. In short, a self-reliant Spain that can maintain its political characteristics is not enough to threaten France, but if France threatens Nationalist Spain and takes adventurous actions, it will inevitably harm itself.

### Hungarian Foreign Minister Goes to Berlin; Italian Foreign Minister Ciano Will Visit Yugoslavia

Budapest, Hungary. Foreign Minister Csáky left for Berlin today at 1:15 PM via Vienna. Before departing, he told the press, "The friendly relations between Germany and Hungary are both in line with the needs of practical politics and in accordance with Hungarian public opinion. The Hungarian nation and Regent Horthy have been loyal to Germany both during and after the European War. This is why the great German race respects us. Moreover, Germany's respect for us has brought us concrete benefits before and after the Munich Conference. We have already invoked the racial principles advocated by Germany and Italy and have achieved considerable results." (Havas, 15th)

Paris. Hungary's decision to join the Anti-Comintern Pact and the upcoming visit of Foreign Minister Csáky to Berlin have been commented on here. There are three aspects that should be noted: 1. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck recently visited Germany and held talks with Führer Hitler. Foreign Minister Csáky's visit to Germany was in fact triggered by Colonel Beck's trip. Hungary's decision to join the Anti-Comintern Pact shows that it has decided to base its foreign policy on the German-Italian axis, thereby weakening its agreement with Poland. Poland's policy in Hungary has been overcome by Germany. In other words, Hungary originally wanted to maintain a balance between Germany and Poland, but it has now changed its policy and is following Germany. 2. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano visited the Hungarian capital last December and advised the country to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, which has now achieved its goal. Germany and Italy previously had different opinions on the issue of Poland and Hungary sharing a border, but this has now been resolved, with Hungary abandoning its original plan and seeking compensation from Romania and becoming closer to Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia's diplomacy is guided by Italy, which is beneficial to Italy. French observers therefore believe that the future meeting of officials from Italy, Yugoslavia, and Hungary has significant political implications. 3. Hungary's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact demonstrates that it is disregarding international opposition and is ideologically approaching totalitarianism. In this way, it will be easier for Germany to enter Romania via Hungary, which will be implemented after Poland is neutralized. (Havas, 15th)

Belgrade, Yugoslavia. An official communiqué has been issued stating that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, at the invitation of Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, will come here within the next week to participate in hunting. Italy and Yugoslavia share a border and signed a friendship treaty in 1937. Foreign Minister Ciano's visit will be an opportunity to discuss various issues of mutual concern. (Havas, 14th)

### 100,000 Germans Flee to France; Foreign Nationals Overpopulate France

Paris. The French Refugee Relief Committee held its first meeting yesterday. Foreign Minister Bonnet attended and delivered a speech, stating that at least 100,000 Germans, considered non-Aryans in their own country, have crossed into France in the past few months. The French government is willing to continue to provide assistance to those seeking refuge here, but it cannot accommodate too many, lest its own people suffer significant losses due to the abuse of the poorly managed immigration law. France has already accommodated 3.2 million foreign nationals and 200,000 refugees, which is unprecedented in other countries. (Reuters, 15th)

London. It is rumored that when the Governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, recently discussed the issue of Jewish emigration in Berlin, Dr. Schacht, the Governor of the Reichsbank, stated that if the proposals put forward by his country could not be accepted by the countries concerned, Germany would be unwilling to continue paying the principal and interest on commercial loans. (Note: Germany's proposal advocates that the countries concerned increase the amount of German goods they import in order to raise funds for Jewish emigration.) Financial circles here are uneasy about this news. If this were to happen, the balance sheets of certain British banks would be seriously affected. In short, if Germany stops paying the principal and interest on commercial loans, either the Bank of England must fully advance the payments, or the private banks must suffer losses, which would greatly affect their profit and loss statements. Sources here also said that the Governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, did not consult the government before going to Germany, which has already caused dissatisfaction in some quarters. Now, if Germany stops paying the principal and interest on loans, Norman's responsibility will be even greater, and he may resign as Governor of the Bank of England. (Havas, 15th)

### Famous American Novel to Be Made into a Movie; English Actress Selected as Female Lead

Hollywood. "Gone with the Wind" by Margaret Mitchell, a novel depicting life in the American South, was a bestseller in Europe and the United States several years ago. After being adapted into a screenplay, the most attention-grabbing role of the female lead, Scarlett O'Hara, has been given to English actress Vivien Leigh. Other leading roles include Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes, and Melanie will be played by Olivia de Havilland. Producer David O. Selznick purchased the film rights to the novel several months ago and immediately began searching for a "typical Scarlett O'Hara." Selznick stated that he chose an English actress to play this Southern beauty because English women can usually master the Southern accent easily. Many famous actresses were considered for the role of Scarlett, including Katharine Hepburn and Norma Shearer. (Reuters, 14th)

### US Aircraft No Longer Sold to Japan; Only One Factory Has Not Complied After State Department Advice

(Washington) According to information revealed by the State Department today, among US aircraft factories, only United Aircraft Corporation has not complied with government advice since July of last year and supplied aircraft and parts to countries that massacre civilians. The so-called countries that massacre civilians clearly refer to Japan. Furthermore, the State Department today "expressed great regret" over the case of issuing 600 propeller blades worth US$102,000 to Japan in mid-December of last year to United Aircraft Corporation. It is said that in the first half of last year, Japan purchased US$9 million worth of aircraft from the US. Afterwards, the State Department sent letters to various aircraft factories, advising them to voluntarily ban the export of aircraft, parts, and aerial torpedoes in order to avoid embarrassing the State Department. Since then, US exports of aircraft and parts to Japan have decreased sharply, forcing Japan to turn to Germany and Italy for purchases in the past six months. At the same time, because Germany and Italy must keep the latest aircraft for their own use, the aircraft Japan obtained are far inferior to those previously purchased from the United States. Therefore, from this spring onwards, the strength of the Japanese air force is bound to weaken. At the same time, with the replenishment of 200 new American bombers and the addition of 500 foreign volunteer pilots in China, the strength of the Chinese air force will inevitably increase significantly. (Associated Press, 15th)

### New American Invention: Military Aircraft

(New York) The American aircraft industry has recently invented a new type of military aircraft that can ascend to an altitude of 6,000 meters in six minutes and to an altitude of 10,700 meters. This aircraft is a monoplane equipped with two machine guns and a 600-horsepower engine. Its maximum speed is 485 kilometers per hour. (Havas, 15th)

### Brazilian Foreign Minister to Visit the US at Roosevelt's Invitation

Washington. Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha, at the invitation of President Roosevelt, is scheduled to come here soon to discuss various issues of mutual concern with the US government. The telegrams exchanged between President Roosevelt and Brazilian President Vargas regarding this matter have been released by the State Department. President Roosevelt telegraphed President Vargas on January 9, stating, "In the past few months, several international issues have arisen that are of great importance to both Brazil and the United States. It would be fortunate if these issues could be discussed frankly by officials of both governments in the spirit of traditional friendship and mutual assistance. I am now telegraphing to invite your Foreign Minister Aranha to visit Washington. If this is acceptable, please have him travel here at the beginning of next month." President Vargas replied today, accepting the invitation, and requested that the issues to be discussed by both sides be communicated to Brazil through diplomatic channels in advance. According to sources, the three issues that the US and Brazil will discuss at that time are: (1) Brazil's exchange management issues; (2) Developing trade through the import and export banks of both sides; (3) Strengthening the existing trade agreement between Brazil and the US.

### Germany Underestimated the US During WWI: Remarks by US Assistant Secretary of War

Washington. Assistant Secretary of War Colonel Johnson delivered a speech, calling on all citizens to unanimously support President Roosevelt's national defense plan. He said that aggressor nations often attack weaknesses rather than strengths, and do not compare themselves with countries that are stronger or equal in strength. The US must strengthen its national defense in order to force other countries to respect its rights. He then revealed some information from the archives of WWI to prove his point. One item said that the famous German generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff both expressed the opinion that "the US's participation in the European War is insignificant." Another item said that German Navy Commander von Holtzendorff reported to Wilhelm II, "I dare to guarantee Your Majesty as a military officer that not a single American soldier will be able to land in Europe." At that time, the US was not valued by Germany, and the rights it possessed were despised by Germany, as can be seen from this. Today, the strength of our country's national defense may not be known to most citizens, but foreign countries know it very well. Our duty lies in establishing extremely strong defenses so that future enemies must think twice before infringing on our country's rights, or even retreat in the face of difficulties. (Havas, 14th)

### Unrest in Burma; National Shipyard Strike

Rangoon. The unrest in Burma recently caused by the passive resistance movement has now spread to the national shipyard. Workers at the factory have begun to strike, and there is a danger of a general strike at the shipyard. There are currently 5,000 strikers in the city. This has become a rallying point for tenant farmers and bus drivers who are dissatisfied with their treatment to form a hunger squad. However, not all members of the group are lawless. The government is now trying to disperse the instigators. It is hoped that this method will prevent the general strike that the Dobama Asiayone party is currently trying to organize from succeeding. To date, a total of 39 people have been detained. (Reuters, 14th)

### League of Nations Council to Discuss Sino-Japanese Issue; Gu Weijun to Request Passage of Resolution; British and French Foreign Ministers Arrive in Geneva

Geneva. Dr. Hu Shih-tse, Director of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations, told an Associated Press reporter that US President Roosevelt's defense message has "significant meaning" for the Chinese appeal case on the League of Nations agenda. He also said that Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun will report to the League of Nations on the current situation in the Far East and may ask the League of Nations to pass a resolution to supplement the inadequacy of past League of Nations resolutions. Hu continued, "Since the last League of Nations Council meeting, the US has made several expressions regarding the situation in the Far East. Today's expression is even more active than past expressions, but it is still difficult to say whether it will help the League of Nations' resolutions." Hu also said, "Since China's resistance war began 18 months ago, its determination has been clear and unwavering, which has been seen by all countries. Furthermore, although the Japanese side claims to respect the interests of third countries, the opposite is true. The interests of foreigners in China are despised by the Japanese side, which shows that the interests of people of all countries are in fact consistent with those of China. Although China is willing to protect the interests of foreigners in China, it also hopes that foreigners can use their own strength to prevent the Japanese from infringing on the interests of foreigners."

### New Antarctic Land Claimed by Norway

Oslo, Norway. Norway has officially incorporated new Antarctic land into its territory. The cabinet issued a statement yesterday saying that the government has decided to place part of the Antarctic coast under Norwegian sovereignty, starting from near the Fox Islands near Coats Land in the west and ending at the boundary of the Australian Antarctic Territory in the east, together with the land inside and outside the coast. This area was first explored and mapped by a Norwegian expedition in early 1929. This new territory has become an important area for Norwegian whaling in recent years. Norway does not exclude other countries from whaling in the area, but Norwegian whalers will be protected and their legitimate activities will not be interfered with by other countries.

### The Palestine Question

London: Arab sources here recently stated that the conference is expected to discuss the following plans: Establishing an Arab federation, including Syria, Palestine, and Transjordan, to be ruled by Emir Abdullah of Transjordan, with Damascus, Syria, as the capital. Palestine will remain a British mandate for the next ten years, but a Jewish state should be established in southern Palestine. The Lebanese Republic should continue to exist as a French mandate. The Aleppo region within Syria, originally belonging to the former Ottoman Empire, should make concessions to Turkey. It is generally expected that after the conference opens, Egypt will play a crucial mediating role between the Arab states and Britain, with the status of both an Arab nation and an ally of Britain. (Havas, 15th)

Beirut: Regarding the round table conference on the Palestine question convened by the British government, scheduled to open this month, both the Arab and Jewish communities are separately discussing their respective stances. Until last month, the Jewish side maintained an opposing view, but without a clear decision. It is hoped that they will eventually change their initial position and participate. As for the Arab side, with the exception of a representative from Palestine, representatives from other Arab countries have gathered in the capital of Egypt, awaiting the arrival of the Palestinian Arab representative to hold a meeting. In connection with this, representatives of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee held important talks here with Palestinian Muslim elders (living in exile here) for four days. It has now been decided to send a representative to participate in the round table conference, but the nominee has not yet been announced. (Havas dispatch, 14th)

### Chinese Troops in Huzhou Attack Nanxun; Chinese Troops Defeat Japanese Troops in Wuzhen

Huzhou Correspondence: Nanxun town, under Huzhou jurisdiction, was attacked by a unit of Chinese troops on the first of this month, causing great panic among the Japanese troops. Because the aim of the Chinese troops was to annihilate the Japanese forces, on the 20th, they set out again from the ××× base area to attack the town. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese troops immediately retreated to the outskirts. The Chinese troops then advanced from Nan Zha and reached Nanxing Bridge, where they destroyed the Japanese fortifications with hand grenades. They continued to search for the Japanese, but found nothing, so they withdrew to their original position. After learning that the Chinese troops had retreated, the Japanese soldiers regrouped and indiscriminately fired machine guns on Nanxing Bridge, resulting in numerous bullet holes in the walls of the buildings.

Wuzhen, under the jurisdiction of Wuxing County, had been peaceful since it was recaptured by Chinese troops last year. Unexpectedly, on the 8th, Japanese aircraft dropped bombs in areas such as Nan Zha, causing panic among the people. On the 12th, suddenly, five or six hundred Japanese soldiers, travelling on more than ten motorboats from the Jiaxing area, approached the vicinity of Bei Zha, attempting to land. This was discovered by the Chinese troops, who immediately set up machine guns and small cannons along both the east and west banks to ambush them. At that time, two Japanese motorboats were hit and sank. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the Japanese troops hastily retreated towards Shuanglin. It is said that the Chinese troops suffered more than ten casualties in this battle. Not counting those who drowned, more than two hundred Japanese soldiers were killed.

### Tragic Situation After the Raids in Huizhou and Boluo, Guangdong Province: Over 300,000 Refugees Urgently Need Relief; Japanese Troops Turn Fields and Houses into Ruins; Chinese Troops Advance on Shilong from Zengcheng

Huizhou Correspondence: In this instance of the Japanese troops invading Guangdong, they landed at Daya Bay, and since the East River (Dongjiang) is a strategically important point, the counties and cities along the East River, such as Huiyang, Boluo, Danshui, Dongguan, Shilong, and their nearby villages, were the first to bear the brunt, suffering various calamities such as arson, looting, rape, and murder. Fortunately, Huiyang, Boluo, and Danshui have been successively recovered, but having been ravaged by the enemy's iron heel, their essence is lost, the houses are in ruins, and the fields are full of refugees. Even a casual inspection brings unbearable pain. According to investigations, there are over 300,000 refugees alone crying out for food. The local government is currently carrying out relief work, which is also being managed by philanthropists and relief organizations from various parties. However, due to difficulties in raising funds and during wartime, all measures are particularly difficult. The post-disaster situation in Huizhou, Boluo, Danshui, and other places is briefly recorded below:

Huizhou

Huizhou city is a crucial military location, so it suffered the most severe damage. Before its fall, it had already been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, and nearly half of the city's businesses had been destroyed. After the city fell, it was again set on fire by the Japanese. Currently, in the Shuishang Street area of the county seat, 80% of the shops have been burned. In the Wanshi Fang and Dashijie areas of the prefectural seat, half of the shops have been burned. Rural villages attached to the city, such as Shangxiatangxia and Shaibuchang, have had their houses completely burned down. The Dongxin iron bridge connecting the prefectural seat and the county seat was destroyed by the Japanese troops during their retreat. In addition, many villages near Huizhou city have suffered extensive looting. There are currently more than 4,000 refugees in the city. The Huiyang Chamber of Commerce is distributing porridge at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, twice a day, but due to the large number of people, the food supply is a serious problem. Currently, the refugees are scattered throughout the city, and the resettlement problem has not been resolved.

Boluo

The location of Boluo County is as important as Huizhou, and the disaster situation is even worse than Huizhou. The shops in the county seat have been almost completely burned, and nine out of ten businesses are empty. More than half of the civilian houses have been destroyed by bombing. The people have fled in all directions. Although the Chinese troops have now recovered the area, very few people have returned. The resumption of business is even rarer. The county magistrate has now returned to the county to preside over relief work. Although the Japanese troops have retreated, Japanese aircraft still occasionally fly over the territory for reconnaissance. In terms of transportation, only the wooden boat traffic between Huizhou and Boluo has resumed. The disaster situation in the nearby areas is most severe in Paiwei Lake, Qinu Lake, Lian'an, Tianpai, Yihe, Xinzaitang, Biaohua, Henghe, Guoshi, Futian, Lianhe, Shuibei, and other places. It is estimated that there are 130,000 to 150,000 refugees in the above-mentioned areas, urgently in need of relief.

Danshui

A total of 702 houses in Danshui city and nearby villages have been burned and bombed. More than 100 people have been killed by bombing in the city and outside the market. Several hundred people have died from starvation, cold, and disease while fleeing. 3,000 people have been displaced and homeless. At the beginning of the relief work, due to the lack of everything after the looting, iron pots, stoves, and all utensils were extremely inconvenient. Therefore, only rice was distributed daily for the refugees to cook themselves. The disaster situation in the villages and towns along both sides of the Hui-Danshui Highway is extremely severe. Xin Xu, Foshanao, Tonghe, Zhenlong, Yazi Bu, and other places have been turned into scorched earth. Shops and civilian houses have been completely burned. The number of refugees is countless. A total of 539 houses have been burned in the various streets of the Shu Xu pig market. The disaster situation in Yazi Bu is considered the most severe, with refugees everywhere, and the number is still being investigated. The first priority is to provide porridge for emergency relief and to rescue the sick. The disaster-stricken areas include more than 1,000 destroyed houses in Ping Le South Township, more than 130 burned houses in Ping Le North Township, more than 490 in Zhenlong Township, more than 100 in Jiazi Bu Xu, more than 80 in Zhenlong Xu, more than 30 in Bu Zai Xu, and more than 40 in Liansheng Xu, for a total of about 3,000 houses.

Shilong

After the Chinese troops recovered Huizhou and Boluo, the Japanese troops retreated to Zengcheng and Shilong, still planning to resist stubbornly. However, the Chinese troops advanced forward with great courage and sharpness, and soon recovered Zengcheng. They then took advantage of the victory and advanced towards Shitan, Xintang, Yao, and Shilong. The Japanese troops blew up the bridge on the Guangzhou-Zengcheng section of the second provincial highway in an attempt to obstruct the Chinese troops' advance. However, the Chinese guerrilla forces had already been active behind the Japanese troops and had cut off the traffic between Shilong and Zengcheng. The Japanese troops had no choice but to retreat and gather in Shilong. As of the 8th, Chinese troops had surrounded the northeast sides of Shitan and Shilong. At the same time, the Chinese troops and county guerrilla forces along the East River and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway were attacking Shilong and Wancheng in Dongguan, and fierce battles had already begun. It is reported that there are only 200 Japanese soldiers in Wancheng, and the surrounding areas outside the city are already under the control of the Chinese troops. The Japanese troops can only close the doors and defend to the death. Since Shilong was occupied by the Japanese troops, it has been subjected to extremely cruel destruction. The people, due to the Japanese troops' humiliation and massacres, have tried every means to escape, leading to an inhuman existence, which is extremely distressing. It is reported that the number of deaths is nearly 1,000 or more, and the number of houses burned and bombed has also reached 1,000. Japanese military tickets and Japanese paper currency flood the market, and the Japanese troops force the citizens to use them. Any slight violation is met with brutal killing. The Japanese troops also instigated thugs to open opium dens and gambling houses to poison the people. Existing brothels were also restored by thugs, and there were even Japanese brothels, and the order was extremely chaotic. Japanese troops and thugs openly looted, several times a day. Businesses that were unattended had long been looted, and even those that were guarded only closed their doors and cowered in fear of unexpected disasters. The scene is not only very desolate, but also full of the atmosphere of burning and killing, truly a city of demons. Recently, due to the successive victories of the Chinese troops in Huizhou, Boluo, and Zengcheng, the Japanese troops were greatly panicked and forcibly conscripted the people to build fortifications in the suburbs and at the railway station. However, the people eagerly hoped that the Chinese troops would recover Shilong as soon as possible, so they could see the light of day again.

### Enthusiastic Enlistment of Civilians from Chaozhou and Meizhou; Over 200,000 Rural Youths Join the Military; Numerous Ardent Youths Apply to the Central Military Academy; Regiment Commander of the Conscription Regiment Volunteers to Fight the Enemy

Shantou Correspondence: Since the July 7th Resistance War, the commanders of the Conscription Regiments of various counties in Chaozhou and Meizhou have been ordered to mobilize youths to join the army. To date, seven phases have been completed. The quota of new recruits in each county is drawn according to the number of people on the household register, and the quota is always filled. Each county sends 1,600 to 2,000 people per phase (one out of every thousand). In total, Chaozhou and Meizhou have sent over 200,000, which are transferred to the front for training and replenishment. The new recruits sent in each phase are all strong men from rural areas, with a very strong sense of national consciousness. When the youths enlist, the whole village sets off firecrackers and holds a farewell banquet to see them off, with the belief that the people take pride in defending the country through military service, so they compete with each other to be enlisted first. Since last year, more than a hundred female students from various girls' schools in Meixian have dressed as men and volunteered to join the army at the Conscription Regiment. The central government believes that the morale of Chaozhou and Meizhou is usable, and has repeatedly established battle merits in the front, such as Yao Ziqing, who defended Baoshan City, and Xie Jinyuan, who defended the Sihang Warehouse, were all from Meixian. Also, the subordinates of Li Hanhun, Zhang Fakui, Wu Qiewei, Luo Zhuoying, Ye Zhao, Deng Longguang, and others are mostly from Chaozhou and Meizhou. Wherever their military force points, they have achieved miraculous feats. The military authorities therefore attach special importance to the people of Chaozhou and Meizhou. Last year, the Central Military Academy, the Military Police School, and the Railway School of the Ministry of Communications all recruited students in the counties of Meixian and Xingning. Because education is developed in these counties, and there are tens of thousands of middle school graduates every year, many young people are struggling to find a way out. The central government is selecting talents in this area, which is easier to get started with than in other areas. Starting this New Year, the Central Military Academy is recruiting students for the sixteenth phase and has specially set up a recruitment office in Xingning City, appointing Zhang Hanliang as the director. The registration period is from January 10 to 25. It is reported that 300 places will be accepted, with a middle school diploma or equivalent education. When this news came out, the number of people from various counties who applied was very enthusiastic, and has now exceeded 500. The county magistrates of Chaozhou and Shantou are also recruiting on behalf of the central government, so that those who are aspiring can apply to the county government nearby. Great importance is attached to the physical examination. All applicants must first pass the physical examination before being sent to Xingning for the examination. It is expected that there will be tens of thousands of applicants, and their enthusiasm for protecting the country and the nation can be seen from this. Luo Rihua, Zhou Weinan, You Guang, Xie Jinming, Wang Buqing, Peng De, Liu Zuoyao, Liu Wenyi, Li Cemou, Huang Yinghao, Jiang Jianping, Ye Guanqiu, Zhang Linmei, and Zeng Guozhen, etc., of the Chaoan Conscription Regiment, are handling the conscription of new recruits. Seeing the young people from various places rushing to join the army, they were greatly moved and felt the sense of renewed vigor. They specially petitioned to the higher authorities in the names of each other, wishing to go to the front line to fight the enemy, which has been approved. On the 3rd, Luo and others left for Xingning. Yan Yingyu, commander of the divisional headquarters, held a banquet to see Luo and others off. Various groups in Chaozhou and Shantou presented flags and bid farewell. Since the War of Resistance, the social atmosphere in Chaozhou and Meizhou has completely changed, becoming more and more enthusiastic and stronger and stronger. Speakers said that if the central government were to set up a special agency in Chaozhou and Meizhou to recruit young and aspiring people, then one million new soldiers could be recruited in a short period of time. It can be seen from this that there is no shortage of soldiers for this War of Resistance.

### Jiaozhi Town, Kunshan Becomes a Den of Opium and Gambling

Kunshan Correspondence: Jiaozhi is an important town in Kunshan, with a dense population. Pan Zhichang, the boss of Zhaochang Cloth Shop in the town, is one of the local tyrants. After the Japanese troops arrived in the town, Pan, braving the greatest disapproval, organized a puppet maintenance society, appointed himself as the puppet chairman, set up checkpoints to collect taxes on goods entering and leaving, and used general hooligans to extort and exploit the people, doing everything possible. He also engaged in large-scale trafficking of drugs, so the profits were very high. Recently, Pan even opened a large gambling den in three rooms of the Fuli Elementary School. Countless ignorant farmers spend tens of thousands of dollars there every day, and there are also many who lose their fortunes. At the same time, the atmosphere of opium smoking is also strong. There are many dens of vice. Since opium and gambling are rampant, Pan extracts taxes from them, in addition to filling his own pockets, he also supplies a portion to the Japanese troops. This is truly a loss of conscience.

### Tactics of the New Fourth Route Army: Secret and Rapid Attacks on the Japanese Army

Continuation of the dispatch from American Evening News special correspondent Belden: The New Fourth Route Army, commanded by Xiang Ying and Ye Ting, is under the command of General Gu Zhutong, commander of the Third War Zone, and is ordered to wage guerrilla warfare. According to Xiang Ying's analysis, the characteristics of guerrilla warfare are: Elusiveness, Taking the offensive, Not building positions, Surprise attacks, Retreating when encountering superior forces, Decisive battles when encountering exhausted troops, Avoiding strength and attacking weakness, But taking the initiative to strike the opponent first, Night battles. Of course, the above are all very vague, but guerrilla warfare cannot be talked about in definite terms without giving actual examples. Before taking the offensive, guerrilla units must scout the enemy's situation, such as the number, habits, sentry posts of the enemy, and when they are most lax. After detecting the enemy's weaknesses, they concentrate their attack on this point. If the Japanese army's defense is tight and there is no weakness to attack, the guerrilla teams lie in ambush nearby and launch a sudden attack when the Japanese army goes out, and then quickly retreat. If the Japanese army does not leave its large troop garrison, the New Fourth Route Army will use the masses, asking them to jointly cut off all Japanese army transportation, so that they cannot get food. If the Japanese army goes out to find food, the guerrilla teams will attack them. The New Fourth Route Army often uses the method of attacking sentries to lure the main force of the Japanese army out of its fortified defense, and then attacks it from behind. Guerrilla warfare values secrecy and speed, making sure the enemy does not know there are guerrilla units in the area. Therefore, the New Fourth Route Army often goes a hundred or two hundred miles away to attack, marching at night. If they cannot reach their destination in one night, they continue to move forward the next night. The New Fourth Route Army's operations usually use at least 400 people as a unit. Guerrilla soldiers must know how to retreat, because they often encounter enemy reinforcements, resulting in a disparity in military strength. Before each attack, they must reveal the retreat route of each soldier and how to respond after an unsuccessful attack. The attacking units are often divided into several small teams, instructing each small team's retreat route and pre-designating the meeting place after the retreat. Because it is often possible to get lost when retreating, the importance of working with the people can be seen from this. The New Fourth Route Army once attacked Jurong, southeast of Nanjing, broke into the city, and occupied the southeast corner of the city, but the Japanese army was still building defensive works in the city and stubbornly resisted. The New Fourth Route Army could not immediately capture the city. When Japanese reinforcements arrived, the New Fourth Route Army dispersed and retreated. Because its retreat routes were extremely numerous, the Japanese army could not concentrate its attack, and could only pursue a small part of them at most, while the rest all retreated. From a logistical point of view, the New Fourth Route Army is one of the poorest equipped in the Chinese army. It has no cannons of any kind. They even say they have no mortars, but this statement is still questionable. There are very few machine guns, and light machine guns, rifles, and hand grenades are also incomplete. According to Xiang Ying's estimation, if each heavy machine gun has the firepower equivalent to 30 rifles, and each light machine gun has the firepower equivalent to 10 rifles, and if the Japanese army replaced all their machine guns with rifles, then the Japanese army's firepower would be ten times greater than that of the New Fourth Route Army. The organization of the New Fourth Route Army's units also varies. The army has four columns, and each column is equivalent to a division, but this is not in terms of numbers, but in terms of command. What distinguishes this army from other regular armies is that it has no brigades. The number of people in each column is also not fixed, some have three regiments and some have four. Another difference from most other armies is that each column does not receive supplies directly from the supply base, but is transferred by the general headquarters. However, neither the supply base nor the general headquarters supplies each column with food, but issues funds for the soldiers to purchase their own. Each soldier receives ten cents a day to buy rice and five cents to buy vegetables. If, for other reasons, the funds cannot be delivered to the front line as scheduled, the captain will borrow from the people. Because money is always repaid after each borrowing, the people generally trust them. According to Xiang Ying, the basic strategy of the New Fourth Route Army is to exhaust the enemy's strength, obstruct their transportation lines, delay their invasion, and assist friendly forces in promoting regular warfare, and then gradually train guerrilla soldiers into the regular army, so that in the future, when the enemy withdraws from China, they can be intercepted.

### Japanese Troops Attempt to Repair the Nanxun Railway for Military Use; Guerrilla Forces Destroy the Ruiwu Highway; Chinese Troops Once Rushed into the City of Ruichang

Jiujiang Correspondence: The Nanxun Railway was heavily damaged when the northern section of the Chinese army retreated. After the Japanese troops arrived, military transportation was quite inconvenient. The Chinese guerrilla forces in the suburbs were also very active, and the Japanese troops were repeatedly attacked and suffered losses. Therefore, the Japanese troops found it extremely difficult to repair the road, and the project was huge and full of obstacles, so progress was slow. The 23rd Regiment of the 6th Division of the Japanese Army in Kyoto, which had previously fought on the Nanxun Railway line, was transferred back for reorganization due to heavy casualties. After the reorganization was completed, it returned to Jiujiang in early November and is now helping 500 Korean female soldiers who came from Dean to protect the road together to facilitate military transportation. Therefore, the Nanxun Road was forced to open to traffic to Huanglaomen on the 28th of last month (Huanglaomen Station is between Shahe and Majieling). In order to reduce the attacks of the Chinese guerrilla forces, the Japanese troops ordered the residents east of the railway line in the Shahe area to move to the west of the railway line by a certain date. The Chinese guerrilla forces were also very active in the Ruiwu Highway area. On the 19th of last month, the roadbed of the highway from Fanjiapu to Wangjiapu, which is about 70 miles long, was thoroughly destroyed, and all bridges and telegraph poles were burned. On the night of the 29th of last month, the Chinese army on the eastern outskirts of Ruichang City once rushed into the city and fought the Japanese troops in the streets. The Chinese army swept the Japanese army in the city for about three hours. Later, because the Japanese troops constantly reinforced their counterattacks, the Chinese army, with the aim having been achieved, voluntarily withdrew from the city. In this battle, more than 300 Japanese soldiers were killed and countless military supplies were seized. The Chinese army also suffered slight damage.

### Various Fellow Provincial Organizations of Hu Province Held a Memorial Service for Wang Yiting Yesterday; The Ceremony Was Extremely Solemn; Respectfully Bestowing the Posthumous Title of "Lord Minghui"

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, eighteen fellow provincial organizations from Hu Province held a memorial service for the late Wang Yiting at the Hu She (Hu Society) on Guizhou Road, and respectfully bestowed upon Mr. Wang the posthumous title of "Lord Minghui." Details of the situation are recorded below:

Arrangement of the Venue

The memorial service was held in the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall of the Hu She. At the entrance of the Hu She, a decorated arch was erected, with a horizontal banner facing Guizhou Road that read, "Memorial Service for Fellow Provincial Wang Yiting." Inside, on both sides, were hung elegiac couplets and mournful poems from various circles. Ascending the steps, one immediately saw a portrait of the late Mr. Wang, inscribed with the four characters "Universal Mourning." Further up was the entrance to the hall, where even more eulogies and elegiac couplets were hung. White silk curtains were draped all around and in the center. In the center of the hall was hung a portrait of the late Mr. Wang, along with the national flag and the party flag. Beside it hung the elegiac couplet from Chairman Chiang, which read, "Amidst the raging storm, his steadfast integrity is even more evident; After restoring order to the universe, we shall mourn this man again." At the front of the hall, on both ends, stood bright lanterns approximately five feet tall, dazzlingly radiant. In front of them were various flower arrangements and potted plants, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere.

Participating Organizations

The organizations participating in the memorial service included: The Shanghai Hu Province Six Counties Association, The Shanghai Huzhou Guildhall, The Zhehu Crepe Industry Association, The Hu She, The Wuxing Silk Weaving Industry Guild, The Wuxing Money Guildhall, The Wuxing County Chamber of Commerce, The Wuxing Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, The Wuxing Crepe Industry Association, The Wuxing Machine Weaving Industry Association, The Huzhou Shanghai Middle and Primary Schools, The Wuxing Electric Company, The Wuxing Orphanage, The Wuxing Branch of the Chinese Relief Association for Women and Children, The Wuxing Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, The Wuxing Cooperative Charity Association, The Hujia Sujia Long-Distance Bus Company, and the Wuxing Crepe Industry Elementary School, etc., totaling eighteen organizations. Representatives including Pan Xulun, Huang Jingwan, Wu Shenbo, Zhou Youjin, Zhou Yueran, Pan Xiangsheng, Wu Zhongxiong, and others, numbered over five hundred people.

Details of the Memorial Service

The presidium consisted of nine people: Pan Xiangsheng, Shen Lianfang, Shen Tianxin, Yan Junxuan, Wen Xuanchen, Zhao Cichen, Shen Yanxiang, Lu Pangzhi, and Zhang Xuren. Pan Xiangsheng presided over the ceremony, and each organization nominated one person to assist. First, Chairman Yan Junxuan delivered a speech, then the presiding officers took their positions, followed by the attendees. Flowers were offered, and then Yan Junxuan reported on Mr. Wang's life and achievements, followed by the reading of the eulogy. Representatives from various organizations, including Wu Dongmai, Wang Yiqun from the Fellow Provincial Association, Niu Zhizi from the Crepe Industry Association, Luo Housheng from the Crepe Industry Elementary School, and Shen Dufu from the Hu She, also spoke. Subsequently, Shen Yanxiang, Wang Dexin, Yu Zhongxian, and others delivered eulogies. Finally, a family representative (son-in-law) Chen Chuanlin gave a speech of thanks.

Bestowing the Title of Minghui

The memorial service resolved to respectfully bestow the posthumous title of "Lord Minghui" to show reverence. The discussion of the posthumous title stated: "Looking back at the regulations established by the Duke of Zhou and the Grand Duke, the purpose of bestowing posthumous titles is to record one's deeds. Actions originate from oneself, and reputation is born from others. Accumulating virtue and performing good deeds leads to a bright reputation that cannot be ignored. After the Qin Dynasty changed the ancient systems, this practice was uniquely discarded. Since the Han Dynasty, adjustments have been made continuously, but it has declined in recent times. As the poem says, 'Lack of virtue goes unrewarded.' How much more so should we encourage goodness and suppress evil, so that the people may thrive and act accordingly? When bright virtue is illuminated, darkness and obscurity will be dispelled. During times of hardship, moral education is crucial. Therefore, it is not appropriate to cease this practice. Thus, Mr. Wang Yiting's virtuous conduct has flourished in the nation, and his benevolence has overflowed into his native region. He was indignant at the arrogance of the invaders, and he threw himself into resisting the enemy. Therefore, the entire region admires his integrity, and the people cherish his virtue, believing that it should not be forgotten. It is appropriate to bestow a posthumous title, which aligns with ancient traditions and does not contradict the sentiments of the people. The posthumous title is not created in vain. After careful consultation, everyone agreed that 'Minghui' (明惠, meaning "bright" and "benevolent") is most suitable. In ancient times, Shu Xiang asked Yan Zi, 'How can a person be said to protect himself?' Yan Zi replied, 'The Book of Songs says, "Being both intelligent and wise, one can protect oneself." Even the benevolent Shu Xiang had such a question. Thus, it is known that without subtle intelligence and wisdom, one cannot speak of this. Mr. Wang was able to uphold his principles amidst great hardship, and he acted upon seeing the signs. He did not travel in an unkempt carriage. The cunning of the Japanese invaders ultimately could not harm him. With the remaining wealth of the bandits, how could one buy the integrity of a good family? Is it not like a tiger with nowhere to use its claws and teeth, or a rhinoceros with nowhere to use its horn? Mr. Wang's integrity firmly placed the Chinese within and the barbarians outside. Feng Meng and Guan Ning lived in Liaodong; what more is there to admire? He can be said to have protected himself. Therefore, bestowing the title of 'Ming' (明, meaning "bright") is most fitting. In the Zhou Dynasty, 'Ming' meant 'illuminating all directions' and 'praising without ceasing.' Neither of these applies to the current situation. These are also the conventions of the Duke of Zhou and the Grand Duke's creation. During the prosperity of the Zhou Dynasty, the disaster of using barbarians to change the customs of China had not yet occurred. Even the sages could not have foreseen this. Mr. Wang's actions should be covered by posthumous title precedents. Xun Qing said, 'There must be adherence to old names, and there must be creation of new names.' Although the actions are different, the titles can be the same. In the Zhou Dynasty, the same name had different meanings, each with its own appropriateness, not limited to a single interpretation. The disaster of the barbarians is extremely urgent today. Thus, distinguishing between the Chinese and the barbarians is 'Ming' (明, meaning "bright"). Intelligent gentlemen should find this acceptable. As for 'Hui' (惠, meaning "benevolent"), it means 'love,' based on the Zhou Dynasty. Mr. Wang often rescued people, showing kindness to widows and orphans. His dedication to universal love is inexhaustible, and the people know it; there is no need to say more. Only benevolence can win people's hearts. Using this to create the posthumous title, and inscribing it on a plain banner, the virtue of kindness and brightness will spread without the need for messengers." Pan Xiangsheng, Yan Junyi, Wu Dongmai, Zhao Cichen, Liu Hanyi, and Cai Weisheng were responsible for sending the posthumous title to the Wang residence. The spirit tablet read (The Honorable Wang Minghui in the Center).

On the fifteenth day of the first month of the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Hu Province Six Counties Association, the Shanghai Huzhou Guildhall, the Wuxing County Chamber of Commerce, the Zhehu Crepe Industry Association, the Wuxing Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Wuxing Money Guildhall, the Wuxing Crepe Industry Association, the Wu and Silk Weaving Industry Association, the Wuxing Machine Weaving Industry Association, the Wuxing Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, the Wuxing Branch of the Chinese Relief Association for Women and Children, the Wuxing Cooperative Charity Association, the Wuxing Orphanage, the Hujia Sujia Long-Distance Bus Company, the Wuxing Electric Company, the Wuxing Crepe Industry Elementary School, the Huzhou Shanghai Middle and Primary Schools, and the Hu She, respectfully present this clear wine and humble offerings to the spirit of Fellow Provincial Wang Yiting, saying: Alas, Heaven has not spared us and has prematurely taken away a man of experience and integrity. Like a star falling from the sky, it has shocked everyone far and wide. Oh, Mr. Wang, with your brilliant talents and heroic spirit, your roots were in Tiaoxi (苕溪), and your footsteps were in Zhoupu (周浦). At a young age, your reputation spread far and wide. In the autumn breeze, you honed your skills and displayed your talents. You had a detached and noble spirit, and you were both a writer and a painter, capable and principled. During the late Qing Dynasty, when the seas were opened, you engaged in business and helped restore profits. When the revolutionary army arose, you donated funds to support them, fulfilling the people's hopes in creating the Republic. After achieving success, you retired and devoted yourself to compassion, benefiting people and helping all, spreading to both Chinese and foreigners. Thinking of your fellow provincials, you established the guildhall, a magnificent building where friends often gathered. You gathered funds to establish schools, benefiting future generations, cultivating talents, and winning universal praise. In middle age, you became immersed in Zen Buddhism, returning to the Pure Land, abstaining from killing, releasing animals, and rescuing those in distress. After the Lugouqiao Incident, you were filled with deep concern. You avoided the noise and bustle by going to the South Sea, enjoying leisurely walks. Unfortunately, you caught a cold and returned to Shanghai. Alas, Heaven did not show mercy and took away our elder. The nation has not yet been stabilized, and a pillar has collapsed. The snow monkeys are weeping softly, and the frost geese are crying loudly. Alas, how sad! Mr. Wang's character was a model of ancient virtue, treating people with humility and living with uprightness. We bestow upon you the posthumous title of Minghui and worship you as a local worthy. We look up to you with reverence, our tears flowing silently. Alas, Mr. Wang, your voice and countenance are beyond our reach; who will discuss the affairs of our hometown with us? Public duty and private feelings are both difficult to forget. We respectfully offer this wine and food, and we announce it to your spirit. Please accept our offerings.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Issues a Statement Regarding Staff Compensation; The Established Method for Adjusting Exchange Rates Is Not Considered a Salary Increase

The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office issued a public statement saying: "The Board of Directors of this Council recently decided on a method to improve staff compensation, which has aroused criticism. There is an apparent misunderstanding about the effects of this method. The Council must first state that the method for adjusting exchange rates as determined in this decision is not a salary increase. If the exchange rate between the British pound and the Chinese national currency falls to one Chinese dollar equaling one shilling, two and three-eighths pence, all allowances will be stopped. The highest basic salary of the main department heads of the Council has in fact been slightly reduced, while their lowest basic salary has been increased slightly."

Calculated Based on the British Pound

Regarding the exchange rate allowance method for "A" category staff (the twenty people consisting of the main department heads, deputy department heads, and other department heads), there are no newly established principles. For many years, one-third of the salaries of these staff members has been calculated based on the British pound. Before this decision by the Council, the minimum exchange rate limit was one Chinese dollar equaling ten and a half pence. If the exchange rate fell below this rate, these staff members would not be able to enjoy the exchange rate allowance they were entitled to. The Council approved the method proposed by the Staff Economic Committee in 1936 when implementing salary reductions, which implicitly granted this allowance. All directors considered this to be the case. The Council's regulations regarding exchange rate allowances set a minimum limit of one Chinese dollar equaling seven pence, with the intention of enabling the Council to re-examine this issue when the exchange rate fell to this limit. The calculation of exchange rate allowances is based on the average exchange rate of the previous month, so each time the exchange rate rises, the amount of the allowance decreases.

One Newly Established Principle

The method established this time contains only one newly established principle, namely that the exchange rate allowance received by the department heads and deputy department heads is greater than that received by other "A" category staff. If the exchange rate is lower than one shilling, two and three-eighths pence, the department heads of the main departments can receive a full allowance on their salaries, and the deputy department heads can receive the same allowance on two-thirds of their salaries. This method seems to have caused a misunderstanding, namely that the salaries of these department heads and deputy department heads have been increased by 100% and 66 and two-thirds percent respectively. This view is actually incorrect, as the basic salaries of these staff members have not been increased. If the exchange rate is one Chinese dollar equaling eight pence, the maximum increase in salary and allowances received by these staff members compared to what they received in December of the previous year is 60%. If the exchange rate rises, the amount of the increase will be reduced.

Establishing Several Positions

In order to maintain the standard level of administration and to be able to hire the necessary personnel, the Council believes it is necessary to establish several positions. The salaries of these personnel, when converted into foreign currency, should be similar to those received by municipal personnel holding the same positions in other major cities around the world. The salaries paid by the Council to senior staff, when converted into foreign currency and compared with those received by staff with the same responsibilities in other organizations, or with those received by staff in some of the larger businesses in this city, are not excessive. There has always been a difference in treatment between "A" grade staff and "B" and "L" grade staff. The salaries of "B" grade staff have always been calculated in Chinese currency. The 15% cost of living allowance determined in this decision has nothing to do with the foreign exchange rate. The Council's intention is to periodically revise the percentage of the allowance based on the level of living expenses.

Reduction in Retirement Savings

Some people believe that the retirement savings provided by the Council will increase with the exchange rate allowance, but in fact, the opposite is true. From January 1st of this year, the retirement savings will be less than before, because since 1937, these savings have been calculated based on the combined amount of the basic salary and the exchange rate allowance, but in the future, they will only be based on the basic salary.

### Regular Chinese Army Arrives in Tangkou, Pudong; Japanese Army Panics and Declares Martial Law; Fears of Chinese Attacks Lead to Indiscriminate Firing of Machine Guns

Three thousand soldiers of the 47th Brigade of the regular Chinese army arrived in Tangkou, Pudong, the day before yesterday. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army panicked greatly and immediately declared special martial law. They also blockaded all ports along the South Huangpu River. At night, they indiscriminately fired machine guns in order to create a false show of strength. Cross-river ferries at Xiaodongmen (小東門) and other locations in the South City have not yet resumed operations as of yesterday. The following are the detailed findings of a reporter from the Modern News Agency:

Regular Troops Arrive in Tangkou

The three counties of Fengxian (奉賢), Nanhui (南匯), and Chuansha (川沙) in Pudong have long been garrisoned by Chinese guerrilla forces led by Li Zhiming (李志明), Yu Taosheng (于陶生), Ding Xishan (丁錫山), etc., who have frequently launched attacks on the Japanese and puppet forces, causing the Japanese army to feel deeply uneasy and exhausted from constant fighting. However, there have also been some mixed units that have used the name of guerrilla forces to harass the local population, causing suffering to the people. In order to effectively adjust the military affairs in various guerrilla areas, to unify command, to enforce discipline, and to achieve the significant effects of guerrilla tactics, the military authorities have dispatched special commissioners to various areas to implement political training work. In necessary areas, regular troops have also been sent to garrison, in order to coordinate with the original guerrilla forces. It is now known that approximately three thousand soldiers of the 47th Brigade of the regular army have arrived in Tangkou, Pudong, the day before yesterday, led by [name redacted], carrying sophisticated weapons, preparing to coordinate with the guerrilla forces and launch attacks on the Japanese forces at opportune moments.

Japanese Panic and Declare Martial Law

After learning of the above news, the Japanese army felt deeply uneasy and panicked greatly. They immediately declared special martial law from 10:00 AM the day before yesterday along the area from Dongjiadu (董家渡), Bailianjing (白蓮涇) to near Tangkou, and impounded all the small ferries operating in the Punan area at the South Pier of Pudong for inspection. The Sanjiang Maru (三江丸) of the Xieji Transportation Company, which departed from the Bund Copper Man Pier for Longhua (龍華) the day before yesterday, was also detained on its return trip to Shanghai. Many Japanese naval personnel in black uniforms inspected the passengers for as long as four hours, and the ferries were not allowed to depart until 2:00 PM. All cross-river ferries in the South Huangpu area were blockaded, and as of yesterday, except for the South Pier of Pudong, which has been allowed to resume operations, the other cross-river ferries such as Xiaodongmen and Dongjiadu have not yet resumed operations.

Indiscriminate Firing of Machine Guns to Create a False Show of Strength

Because the Japanese army feared attacks from the newly arrived regular Chinese army, in addition to declaring special martial law, blockading ferries, and stepping up inspection work, they also indiscriminately fired machine guns in the Tangkou area the night before last for as long as two hours. Residents in the vicinity clearly heard the sound of gunfire, and it only stopped after the Chinese army did not take any action. It is believed that their intention was undoubtedly to create a false show of strength. The Japanese army's self-induced alarm shows the extent of their panic and unease.

### Japanese Side Gives Evasive Reply to Tariff Questions; Only One Foreign Debt Repaid After the Signing of the Anglo-Japanese Agreement; Payment of Other Maturing Foreign Debts Postponed Indefinitely

The *North-China Daily News* reports that at a reception for foreign reporters on Friday (the 13th), a Japanese spokesman answered questions regarding the collection of taxes by the Jianghai Customs, the repayment of foreign debts secured by tariffs, and other issues. The spokesman said that since May 3 of last year, when the British and Japanese authorities reached an agreement on customs issues, the customs revenues in the areas occupied by the Japanese army have been deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. Of this, a little over one million yuan was paid out last year for the maturing installments of the 1913 Reorganization Loan. Subsequently, because the Chinese government failed to fulfill certain terms stipulated in the agreement, the maturing installments of foreign debts have not been repaid. This is because the Chinese government has not agreed to certain regulations in the agreement requested by the British government. In answering the question of whether the Chinese government approved of this Anglo-Japanese agreement, the spokesman said that it appears that the Chinese government is unwilling to accept the British request to fulfill certain regulations in the agreement. As for the "Reform Government," it has neither withdrawn funds under the tariff heading nor borrowed funds secured by tariffs. When a reporter asked what regulations the Chinese government had not fulfilled, the spokesman replied that one of them was the Chinese government's refusal to repay Japanese loans in the various loans secured by tariffs. The taxes collected from September 1937 to January of last year, before the signing of the agreement, have not been transferred to the Inspector General of Customs in accordance with the terms of the agreement announced in London and Tokyo on May 3. Regarding the amount of tax revenue deposited in the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, he did not have this information, and he was also unaware of whether there were 25 million yuan (this figure was cited by a reporter) deposited in HSBC. Regarding the agreement, a certain American reporter stated that this seemed to be a matter between Britain and Japan, so the United States, France, the Netherlands, and other countries were not considered. The spokesman replied that by reading the announcements published in London and Tokyo, one could see that the United States, France, and other countries had not raised any objections. The American reporter continued, "To my knowledge, the United States did not participate in these negotiations and has never agreed to it." The spokesman replied again by suggesting to read the announcements and said that this announcement proves that the United States has not made any objections. The reporter said that the American authorities in Shanghai had stated very clearly that they did not participate in these negotiations and that the maturing installments of American debts had not been paid. In response to this, the spokesman said that he would rather not talk about the points that were not announced when the agreement was signed. The reporter continued that since the signing of the agreement, American debts had not been repaid and that he was now finding out about the status of American debts, that the maturing installments were either deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank by the Japanese side or deposited in HSBC by the British side. The spokesman refused to answer and only said that he had told everything he knew about this issue. The spokesman then denied that Japan had independently repaid 400,000 pounds of overdue British Boxer Indemnity payments that China had not paid. At this point, a certain American reporter said that it seemed that all Japanese debts were secured by the Yokohama Specie Bank, all British debts were secured by HSBC, and the rest of the countries were ignored and could not say a word about it because Britain and Japan had an agreement. The spokesman said that apart from the Reorganization Loan, the maturing installments of other loans had not been paid, and that the reason why the Reorganization Loan was paid was because it was the first maturing installment after the signing of the agreement. As for the payment of funds when the Chinese government did not agree to the terms of the agreement, this was because there were no dealings between the Chinese and Japanese governments, so this payment was made through a third party. A reporter asked that since the maturing installments of one loan had been repaid, why should the payment of maturing installments of other loans be delayed? The spokesman replied that he did not have detailed information about the reason for this, but the payment policy had been changed to await the Chinese government's approval.

### Developing the Resources of the Interior; Completing Transportation Infrastructure; Constructing Railways, Improving Highways, and Opening Waterways; Transport Effective; Military Supplies and Relocation Can Be Ensured

The Chinese government, considering that the development of the interior's resources requires the completion of transportation infrastructure, has now constructed the Yunnan-Burma, Sichuan-Kunming, and Yunnan-Myanmar international railways to transport materials, improve highways, facilitate the flow of goods, open new waterways, strengthen transportation, and organize transportation, which has been effective. Expanding aviation to facilitate flight, details are recorded as follows:

Constructing Railways to Benefit the War of Resistance

Railway construction is a major condition for the War of Resistance, because railways are the largest means of transportation, and the materials required are mostly from abroad, so there must first be a means of transportation for large quantities of railway materials before construction can be discussed. Therefore, the Yunnan-Burma and Sichuan-Kunming railways have been constructed first, opening up international thoroughfares and connecting the economies of Sichuan and Yunnan. Then, the construction of connecting railways in various provinces such as Guizhou-Guangxi and Sichuan-Yunnan will be carried out. Such as: Yunnan-Guizhou Railway, from Guiyang to Kunming, 750 kilometers long; Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, from Chongqing to Guiyang, 600 kilometers long; Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, from Guiyang to Liuzhou, 800 kilometers long; Sichuan-Kangding Railway, from Chengdu to Kangding, 200 kilometers long; Guangxi-Vietnam Line, from Yining to Zhennanguan, 150 kilometers long.

Improving Highways to Facilitate Transportation

The construction of highways is easier than railways, and most of them are earth and stone projects, and the required foreign materials are less. The highways in the southwestern provinces are more developed than those in other provinces. The roads opened to traffic before the war were 27,000 kilometers, accounting for a quarter of the country. The existing road lines are Jiangxi-Yunnan, Sichuan-Guangxi, Guangxi-Fujian, Hunan-Guangxi, Sichuan-Hunan, Sichuan-Yunnan, Guangxi-Yunnan, Sichuan-Hubei, Shaanxi-Kangding, Yunnan-Burma, Guangxi-Vietnam, etc. The above lines are all national trunk lines, and other provincial and county roads are too numerous to mention. The highways in each province can be interconnected. The previous dirt roads have now been repaired. Now, according to the order of the Ministry, purchase additional vehicles to increase the amount of passenger and freight transportation, improve the road surface to allow heavy vehicles to pass, save fuel consumption, increase ferries, build large bridges, and expand repair shops to store and purchase self-made parts.

Opening New Waterways to Promote Cooperation

After the coastal routes were blockaded by the Japanese, the national ships in Beiyang and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were completely forced to stop sailing. Now the government has decided to make full use of inland waterways to facilitate transportation. The main waterways are the Yangtze River, the Xijiang River, the Xiangjiang River, the Guijiang River, the Liujiang River, the Yuanjiang River, etc. New and improved navigation lines in Sichuan, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces will be used in conjunction with highways and railways. Jianglun (江輪) and small boats will be used for transport from the upper streams. Loans are available to add wooden ships to enrich water transport tools. Promote navigation cooperation to improve water transport efficiency. Set up cable stations along dangerous shoals along the river to ensure safe navigation. The Minsheng Company (民生公司), which operates in the upper reaches, has designated 48 ships to operate on the Yichang-Chongqing, Wanxian-Fuling-Chongqing, Chongqing-Luxian-Jiaxing, and Chongqing-Hechuan lines.

Opening International Direct Flight Routes

There are three airline companies: Southwest, China, and Eurasia. China's routes are Chongqing-Chengdu, Chongqing-Kunming, Hong Kong-Hanoi, and Chongqing-Jiaxing. Eurasia's routes are Shaanxi-Hong Kong, Chengdu-Kunming, Chongqing-Hong Kong, and Shaanxi-Chengdu. Southwest's routes are Guangzhou-Hanoi, Guangzhou-Hekou, Guangzhou-Qiongzhou, and Guangzhou-Nanning. The three companies have a total of 12 lines, with a total length of 8,600 kilometers. Now, it has been decided to open international direct flight routes to connect major locations in Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Burma. At the same time, add airports in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces, and increase the night navigation equipment of existing airports to facilitate flight and expand business. Although there have been unfortunate incidents such as the Guilin aircraft, the expansion will not be stopped due to the influence of the war.

Trial Operation of Carrying Has Been Quite Effective

All obstacles such as mountains, deep ravines and other undeveloped areas in the inland areas have to be replaced by human power. Now it has been decided to carry out transportation by carrying, and all the inherent primitive power and tools such as human power, animal power, shoulder carrying, civil boats, and wooden rafts are used as much as possible according to local conditions. Now it is being piloted in the Yibin to Kunming section, and it is estimated that the freight is cheaper than highway transportation, and the amount of transportation can be developed as much as possible without being restricted by modern materials, so it is imperative to universally and vigorously advocate transportation by carrying, so that carts can be seen on the sides of highways in various inland provinces, and groups of carriers can be seen on the roads, so that military supplies and trade migration can be worry-free in the future.

Telecommunications Industry Vigorously Expanded

The telecommunications industry is closely related to the transportation industry, so when the government completes the construction of inland transportation, it will try its best to expand telephones and telegrams. Telegrams: In terms of telegrams with money, speed up the addition of telegraph trunk lines and expand existing single lines. In terms of radio, plan to set up a radio express communication network, increase international radio telegraph direct circuits, and build small radio stations in major cities and adjacent provinces and regions in various border provinces. Telephone: Decide to expand the existing phone lines to form a long-distance telephone system in the southwest and northwest. Connect Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Yangon with inland wireless telephones to communicate with the seaports. Add carrier telephone equipment to the centers of each province. Expand telephone services in major cities.

### Rice Prices Rise Due to Increased Taxes Imposed by the Japanese Puppet Regime

Since the Japanese puppets dug up the economy and imposed a variety of taxes, not only have merchants increased their burden, but also raised the price of materials, harming the general public. Now, the price of rice in Shanghai has increased due to the sudden reduction in supply after the imposition of heavy taxes, with the highest grade of white rice at 12.56 yuan per picul, and the medium grade at 11.78 yuan, an increase of about 4 jiao per picul compared to the market price three days ago.

(4) Welcoming the Era of Shanghai's Restoration

While the activities of Japanese merchants have been quite prominent, the spirit of hard struggle by national capital is also commendable and moving. To maintain the livelihoods of workers and revive the lifeline of national products, they are all fighting against adversity. Those who moved to the interior have long been mobilized, and many have also moved into the concessions. Some even rely on dilapidated walls and ruins in the border areas of the concessions to revive their businesses. Moreover, those who use all their abilities, regardless of the amount of capital, to find houses and set up factories in the concession areas are also emerging like a storm.

According to a survey (2): The original Chinese-owned yarn factories that have resumed operation include:

Shen Xin No. 2 Factory: 63,884 spindles

No. 9 Factory: 95,616 spindles

Xin Yu No. 1 Factory: 28,060 spindles

No. 2 Factory: 24,920 spindles

Hong Zhang: 30,936 spindles

Yong An No. 3 Factory: 63,180 spindles

Tong Yi: 79,700 spindles

Qin Feng: 4,240 spindles

Da Tong

He Ji: 33,024 spindles

Chong Xin: 34,000 spindles

Total of 11 factories: 456,560 spindles

In addition, many small-scale yarn factories have recently been newly established and are now in operation or about to start.

(Note) Shen Bao, September 27, 1938, stated that those related to British merchants' XXX work include the following:

Yarn spindles (bells)

After all these new factories start operating, Shanghai will have 18 yarn factories producing domestic yarn and cloth, with 534,870 spindles. Although this cannot be compared with the pre-war situation, and in terms of overall national policy, it is unreasonable to be located in the concessions under the current situation. However, for patriotic people in the isolated island: at least there is a possibility of continuing to use domestic products in the future.

(Note) Wu Xinqi's "Adjustment of China's Cotton Industry in Wartime" in the Shanghai Shen Bao Economic Special Issue, October 24, 1938. However, for Shanghai's textile industry to restore its glory in the history of national industry, there are only two paths left:

First: Do not sell yourself for reliance, at least do not recognize a thief as your father. Only then will you not disgrace the reputation of Shanghai's Chinese yarn factories!

Second: Only by welcoming the political and military restoration can Shanghai transcend the sinful environment it is currently in, and also achieve restoration!

### Northern Jiangsu Ports Not Blockaded

Shipping Continues as Usual

Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Still Stationed in Original Defenses

Qingshan Maru Only Docks at Qinglong Port

The rumor that the ports of Qidong, Haimen, and other counties in northern Jiangsu have been blockaded by the Japanese is not true. Foreign merchant ships are still sailing as usual. The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's Qingshan Maru only docks at Qinglong Port. All Chinese troops along the river, after being ordered to adjust their positions, are still stationed in their original defense areas. The details are as follows:

Various ships continue to operate to ports north of the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, which are under the jurisdiction of Haimen County, including Songji Port, Niuhong Port, Laohong Port, Hutong Port, Shuji Port, Da'an Port (Qinglong Port, where Japanese troops are stationed), and Lingdian Port. Those under the jurisdiction of Qidong County include Sanhe Port, Dongyihao, and Dongerhao. During the peak period of freight transportation, there were more than a dozen foreign ships sailing to and from these ports. Now, the number has gradually decreased. The rumor that the ports have been blockaded by the Japanese is not true, according to inquiries from the shipping industry and people from Haimen by reporters from the Modern News Agency yesterday. It is now known that British merchants' Hanhe, German merchants' Paide and Haiyi, and Italian merchants' Tangqiao, Deyao, Libei, and Saint Rosie foreign merchant ships are operating as usual.

Japanese Ships Only Dock at One Port: Haimen's Qinglong Port. After Japanese troops landed at Qinglong Port in October of last year, the port was used as a military stronghold due to its strategic location, echoing Dasheng No. 3 Factory, which is more than ten miles away from the port. The port is wider, which facilitates communication between the army and navy, so it is easier for the Japanese army to defend. Since the Japanese army was stationed there, commercial transportation has been suspended for a long time, turning it into a dead port. In order to seek development, the Japanese Nisshin Kisen Kaisha now sends the Qingshan Maru to operate, and taxes and donations are controlled by the Japanese puppet regime. Merchants and residents of all industries are unwilling to bow down and be oppressed by the enemy. Japanese soldiers take advantage of the name of inspection to loot property, so merchants are very wary. All cargo is loaded and unloaded at other ports. Although Japanese ships have reduced freight rates to attract customers, no one pays attention. Freight transportation is extremely sluggish.

Chinese Troops Adjusted Defense Positions: The military and administrative work in the guerrilla area of the Eastern Battlefield has been ordered by the central government to the responsible officials and the highest administrative organs in the Sparrow City to handle it properly. All bandit troops who use the guise of guerrillas but actually rely on robbery and seizing territory must be thoroughly eliminated. The complete disarmament of Zhou Fang's troops in Qidong is an example of this. Chinese troops in northern Jiangsu have contacted the regular army and reorganized. At the end of last year, thousands of Japanese and puppet troops harassed Qihai and were severely attacked by the Chinese troops, resulting in many casualties on both sides. However, the Japanese army was eventually driven out. All Chinese troops gathered from various inland areas have been adjusted and stationed at their original ports. If they dare to invade, they will be severely suppressed.

### The Total Trade Volume of the Jianghai Customs in 1938 Showed a Deficit of 46.91 Million Yuan. Trade Recovered to the First Position Starting in June Last Year.

The total trade of Jianghai Customs last year (1938) was 26,909,235 yuan for imported foreign goods and 22,218,1071 yuan for exported local goods. The total value of imports and exports was 49,127,3386 yuan, with a deficit of 46,911,244 yuan. At the beginning of its duties, Jianghai Customs lost its leading position in the country due to the shift of the entire trade center inland, resulting in a decline in both imports and exports. Since June of last year, trade has gradually recovered to the first position due to the restoration of inland transportation and the increase in population in the concessions. However, Japanese goods still accounted for the majority of imported foreign goods, decreasing by about half compared to the previous year. During the same period of the previous year, imports were 50,884,4132 yuan and exports were 40,439,5418 yuan. Jianghai Customs used to be the only port with a trade deficit, but after the competent authorities took measures to eliminate it, it decreased by 57,537,470 yuan last year compared to the previous year. Last year, candles, soap, oil, wax, glue, and rosin accounted for the first place in imported foreign goods, followed by gold and mineral sands. Animals and animal products accounted for the first place in exported local goods, followed by textiles.

### The Materials Stolen from the China Merchants Electric Company are Worth 500,000. After the Power Plant Was Forcibly Occupied, Electricity Was Generated Without Permission.

The Original Workers Deeply Understand the Situation and Firmly Refuse to Work.

The Nanshi China Merchants Electric Company is the only important enterprise in the urban area. Since the fall of Shanghai, the internal wealth-generating materials have been stolen. Recently, the "China Central Water and Electricity Company" forcibly seized the power plant, recruiting ignorant workers to work there. The original workers deeply understand the situation and firmly refuse. The reporter from the Modern News Agency learned the following from the relevant parties:

Hardware Materials Stolen

Since the outbreak of the war, the Nanshi China Merchants Electric Company has moved its important documents to the HSBC Building on the Bund. All offices, workshops, and factories of the Nanshi Company were completely sealed. When the National Army moved west and Nanshi was occupied by the Japanese army, the Zhilan unit was stationed at the Nanshi Mulaishui Factory, and guards were stationed at the old and new factory gates of the China Merchants Electric Company. On one hand, they colluded with Japanese hooligans to move away the wealth-generating materials from the China Merchants Electric Company's lighting, technology, transportation, and engineering offices. The three lathes, two drilling machines, twelve vices, and more than twenty motors in the car factory's repair department, ten sets of electrical equipment, dozens of car wheels, as well as wire, electrical materials, copper, iron, tin, and various hardware, totaling more than 500,000 yuan, were all stolen.

Unauthorized Power Generation Damages Boilers

Recently, the Japanese puppet regime has been inducing the China Merchants Electric Company to cooperate in order to seize the water and electricity business, but they were severely rejected. The puppet organization then forcibly occupied the property of the seven major water and electricity plants and sent personnel from the "China Central Water and Electricity Company" to take over. On one hand, they recruited ignorant workers to work in the Nanshi Power Plant and actually generated electricity. However, because these workers lacked technical knowledge, all the boilers were burned out and are now unusable. The Japanese are sending personnel to repair them.

Original Workers Firmly Refuse to Work

Because the new workers lacked technical skills and suffered major damage to the power generation work, the Japanese puppet regime sent many traitors last month to win over the old workers of the China Merchants Electric Company, enticing them with high salaries and instructing them to work. However, all the workers deeply understood the situation. Although they had been unemployed for a long time and their lives were precarious, they were able to maintain their integrity for the sake of the whole country and refused to enter the factory to work.

### Two More Batches of Jewish Refugees Arrive. The Committee is Preparing a Building to Move All Refugees In.

The Continental News reported that yesterday (the 14th), a person in charge claimed that two more batches of Jewish immigrants, totaling 250 people, arrived in Shanghai today (the 14th). The problem of taking care of these immigrants has become increasingly serious. There are now 1,500 Jewish refugees in Shanghai, of which only 20% can support themselves. Sir Sassoon's donation of 1.5 million yuan for rehabilitation has slightly alleviated the difficulties, and many immigrants have gained new hope in their lives. However, this fund is specifically designated to assist immigrants in engaging in business, as the committee believes that assisting refugees in rehabilitation is the most appropriate way to deal with the refugee relief problem and avoid difficulties in finding jobs in this city. Temporarily maintaining the minimum accommodation for immigrants in Shanghai requires about 90,000 yuan per month, but this amount has not yet been fully raised, so the living conditions of the newly arrived immigrants are quite pitiful. In order to improve this situation, several large buildings have been taken over in the Huishan and Hongkou districts, and they are being renovated. It is hoped that all the refugees can be moved into them in the short term, and then a centralized food distribution system will be started, which can further reduce expenses. The former Customs Training School opposite the Xilao in Huade Road is the largest of the buildings. After renovation, it can accommodate 1,200 people and is expected to be ready for the refugees to move in within two weeks.

### The Guangdong Fellow Villagers' Relief Conference for Refugees from Guangdong and Guangxi was Held Yesterday at the Da Dong Restaurant. 26 Groups Were Formed to Solicit Donations.

The Guangdong Fellow Villagers' Relief and Fundraising Committee for Refugees from Guangdong and Guangxi in Shanghai, held a meeting on January 15, with Xia Guoshun, Yang Meinan, Li Ze, Guo Zhongliang, Pan Zhiquan, Cui Pingxi, Chen Qifen, Chen Qiluo, Jiang Hechun, and others.

More than 200 people

First, Xia Guoshun, the vice chairman of the committee, delivered an opening speech, saying that today is the general meeting of all fundraising committee members of the Guangdong Fellow Villagers' Relief and Fundraising Committee for Refugees from Guangdong and Guangxi in Shanghai. Thank you all for your enthusiastic participation and support. After the "August 13th Incident", the fellow villagers in this city suffered terribly, but after the outbreak of the war in South China, the fellow villagers in Guangdong and Guangxi,

Suffered Even More Terribly

It is hoped that fellow villagers from all walks of life will generously donate and work hard to raise funds, so that the refugees from Guangdong and Guangxi will benefit greatly.

It was decided that Cui Pingxi, the director of the design department of the committee, would report on the

Preparatory Process

It was briefly stated that when the committee held its inaugural meeting at Mr. Feng Bingnan's residence on December 13 last year, more than 10,000 yuan had been pledged on the spot. Now, according to the industry, it is divided into 26 groups, including groups for organizations, finance, department stores, and education, to raise funds separately, and 18 collection agencies have been set up in various districts of the city.

### The Guerrilla Unit in Southern Pudong Trains Cadres and Establishes a Cadre Training Class

Ding Xisan, the commander of the Third Detachment of the Patriotic Salvation Army of the Guerrilla Unit in Southern Pudong, showed with his leadership that the second phase of the Anti-Japanese War emphasizes guerrilla warfare. The progress in the future necessarily requires innovation and the training of cadres to cultivate new forces. A cadre training class was specially held in the headquarters of this unit to recruit ambitious young people to train in guerrilla tactics and instill political knowledge, so as to achieve unity between the military and the people. The opening ceremony was held at a certain place on New Year's Day. Commander Ding, Director He of the Political Department, and other instructors attended the ceremony to explain the purpose of the opening class. More than 100 students attended the class. Classes began the next day. Once the training is completed, they will be assigned to various units to enrich the lower-level cadres and promote the Anti-Japanese War.

### The Sailing Ship's Long Voyage, Ambitions Unfulfilled, the Ship Was Damaged and Auctioned in Japan, the Captain and Others Were Also Sent Back to Shanghai

The Continental News reported that the sailing ship Meiling was owned by an American. It set off from Wenzhou, intending to cross the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco. A few days later, it encountered a storm and was forced to dock near a certain Japanese naval base on Boko Island (transliteration), where it was arrested by the local Japanese authorities. The American Consulate in this city received yesterday (the 14th) 400 yen and three wooden boxes sent from the island, containing five cameras belonging to the ship's captain, Mr. Nichols, and his crew. As for Mr. Nichols and his crew, after detailed investigation and questioning by the Japanese side, they have been sent back to Shanghai. The ship Meiling was already broken. The hull was collected by local fishermen, and sundries were salvaged and publicly auctioned. The 400 yen is the proceeds from the sale.

### Domestic Factories Should Apply for Domestic Goods Certificates as Soon as Possible. Merchants Selling Goods Should Recognize the Quality. If it Does Not Meet the Standards, it Should be Reported Secretly.

The rules for the issuance of domestic goods certificates by the Ministry of Economic Affairs were revised and promulgated in September 1938. Among them, regarding the standards for domestic goods, it is stipulated that domestic factories using foreign capital, foreign raw materials, and foreign engineers are generally not recognized as domestic goods during wartime if they belong to the enemy. If a factory that has already obtained a certificate changes its organization, resulting in it not meeting the requirements of the domestic goods standard, its certificate should be revoked. Regarding the review of domestic goods, a special committee of 30 to 50 people will be set up within the review committee, recommended by local industrial and commercial organizations and then appointed. The task of these special committee members is to answer inquiries, provide opinions, and report on domestic goods factories. In the future, the review and certification of domestic goods will inevitably become more complete. Compatriots at home and abroad who have factories should apply for certificates in accordance with the rules as soon as possible if their products meet the standards of domestic goods, so that they can be sold. Those who sell domestic goods as their main business should pay attention to whether the products they sell are domestic goods that have obtained certificates. If it is found that there are goods that have changed in quality and do not meet the standards, they must report the facts to the government at any time to revoke their certificates.

### Japanese Troops and Japanese Goods Occupying Four Warehouses Show Signs of Withdrawal. The Marine Corps at the New Warehouse Has Withdrawn, and Goods from the Three Warehouses Have Begun to Be Moved.

The New Warehouse and Chinese Warehouse in Pudong, and the Central Warehouse and North Warehouse in Hongkou of the American-owned Velely & Company, were all in the war zone. After the war moved west, they were suddenly occupied by the Japanese army. The New Warehouse was filled with food and horse feed, the Central Warehouse housed wounded soldiers and stored food, and the North Warehouse stored ammunition. All four warehouses were used for military purposes. During the spring of this year, the authorities of the Weilihan Company requested to take over in the capacity of property owners, but the Japanese side once expressed objections. A year has passed, and it has recently been heard that one company of the Japanese Marine Corps originally stationed in the new warehouse in Yangjiadu, Pudong, had completely withdrawn from the warehouse the day before yesterday and moved to the third battalion headquarters of the Customs Warehouse at Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui. However, the floor of the new warehouse and some of the existing goods have been dismantled and removed. Four floating wharves along the Pudong shore were also dismantled and dragged to Yangshupu by the Japanese army. Therefore, only a few empty houses remain in the new warehouse. The goods stored in the Chinese Warehouse, Central Warehouse, and North Warehouse have also begun to be moved.

### The Great Fire in Changsha, as Described by an Eyewitness, Refugees Suffered Greatly, Mr. Hoskins' Talk

The Continental News reported that Dr. Hoskins, a representative of the American trustees of Xiangya University in Changsha and an eyewitness to the great fire in Changsha, arrived in Shanghai recently. Yesterday (the 14th), he told reporters that after the great fire in Changsha in November, the rubble has now been cleared, and 70,000 to 100,000 people have returned to the city. Relief programs are also underway, but the most tragic suffering of the people of Changsha has not yet arrived. When they fled the city, they all

Slightly Carried Silver and Thread

The government also allocated huge sums of money to temporarily maintain them, but now it has been exhausted. In the next few months of winter, they may suffer the most profound suffering. Mr. Hoskins also talked about the great fire in Changsha, saying that he passed through Changsha on the afternoon of November 12, the day before the fire. He saw no more than twelve people in the entire city. He returned to Changsha that night, and people fled to the suburbs. A great fire broke out that night, and some people were awakened from their sleep, wearing thin clothes and hurrying to escape. As a result of the fire, Changsha was burned down

Three-Quarters

But it is surprising that so few people died in the fire. It is believed that most people had been warned in advance. The day after the fire, only one wounded person was brought to Xiangya Hospital, who was a gambler and was injured when the roof collapsed and hit him. Only then did he realize that there was a great fire. Xiangya's property was all in the suburbs, so it was not affected. Mr. Hoskins also said that Xiangya was not, as rumored, "outside the city", because the city walls of Changsha had been demolished for eighteen years. Relief work in Changsha is being handled by the local International Committee, which is trying to enable people to return to Changsha and intends to implement the following within three days:

Relief Work: Those who return to the city will be given soft loans, but they must be repaid. This will not only make the recipients know how to cherish them, but also allow them to lend this fund to others in the future. Industrial projects have already started, with women engaged in the manufacture of soap and cloth. 60 women have now been employed. 60 workers will be taught weaving skills by experts and trained for a month. When their skills are proficient, they will be given adequate loans as capital for self-reliance in the weaving industry. Soft loans are particularly effective in Hunan Province. A few years ago, the International Red Cross had

Tried Loan

The result was quite satisfactory. Diseases are rampant around Changsha, and doctors have already encountered many difficulties. It costs several yuan to treat one patient with malaria using the least amount of quinine. The cost of treating the spread of malaria is enormous. The International Red Cross uses the funds to subsidize hospitals and provide medical supplies to fundamentally assist medical work. The 70,000 to 100,000 people who have now returned to the city are all the

Poorest Class

After the fire, the government immediately allocated huge sums of money for relief. Fortunately, many people are engaged in small businesses, but there is no large-scale commerce. Four primary schools have been set up in the city to provide medical care for poor children, with about 300 students. The people of Changsha are about to suffer the most tragic suffering. Relief work is most urgently needed in the coming winter months.

### Kidnapping and Raping a Young Girl Arrested, The Tailor's Behavior is Outrageous, The Missing Girl Has Not Yet Been Found

Han Baolin, a 21-year-old Danyang native who lives at No. 6, Lane 1316, Xinzha Road and works as a tailor, lured Qiu Feng, a 15-year-old adopted daughter of his neighbor Xu Dehong from the same village, on the 10th of this month to a certain hotel at No. 1, Lane 231, Albury Road in the French Concession for rape. After Xu Dehong reported the girl's disappearance to the Gaobian Road Police Station, Chinese detective Xu Gengrong investigated the matter and arrested Han at the tailor shop at No. 6, Xinzha Road, at 2 p.m. on the day of the incident. He went to No. 1, Albury Road in the French Concession to search for Xu but found nothing. He was then taken to the police station and escorted to the First Special Court the day before yesterday. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer, applied for a family trial on behalf of the defendant. The defendant's testimony was hesitant. Judge Huang ordered him to be detained for further investigation.

### Kidnapping Two Girls, The Female Bandit Was Detained, Hesitant Testimony, Investigation and Verification

Zhang Haiming, a Cheduo native from Xiaoshazhi, Binlang Road, lost his eight-year-old daughter Gendi, and Wang Delong, a Jiangbei native from No. 99 Yanping Road, lost his eleven-year-old daughter Luo Xiaoerzi, around 2 p.m. on December 31 last year, while playing on the street nearby. They were lured away by bandits and disappeared. The case was reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which was in charge of investigating cases of kidnapping. It was not until the day before yesterday that Chinese Detective Wei Hanpo received a report from an informant that Gendi and Sao Xiao's son were found in the residence of a Wan woman, Zhang Wu, at No. 918, Dongqingli, Louye Road. The Chinese and Western detectives went there in the afternoon and arrested the female bandit, Si Yijue, Wu Luanhu, Hu Yuteng. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant said at the police station that the two girls were brought and fostered by Hao Yang, a fellow villager who was on the run, and were given 30 yuan for food and porcelain. His words are true and commendable. It is not known. Now that the parents of the two girls have arrived in court, the supply line is hesitant. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to be detained again for further investigation. The girls Zhang Xiaodi and Luo Xiaoerzi are allowed to be taken back by Zhang Haiming and Wang Delong.

### Theft of Machinery, Interception and Arrest, Factory Owner Mr. Hou Apprehended for Receiving Stolen Goods, Two Thieves Detained Along with Mr. Hou for Further Investigation

Since the evacuation from Shanghai’s factory areas and the westward movement of the National Army, the Yangshupu area beyond Hongkou and Yingkou cannot be fully open. Many factory owners, in their haste to evacuate, left behind heavy machinery essential for production and attracting capital. Taking advantage of this situation, numerous vagrants infiltrated these two districts, engaging in theft to make a living and selling stolen goods for daily sustenance. Recently, a man named He Sanda stole a rolling mill worth two hundred yuan from a machinery factory at No. 772 Dong Youzhi Road. He transported it near Gongping Road, where he was interrogated by Zhang Jiansheng, a Chinese detective of the Lushun Police Station, and detectives Li Zhaozhao and Sai Jue, who discovered that the item was stolen. They immediately arrested him, along with the rolling mill, and took him to the police station. The detectives investigated the owner of the machinery factory but could not locate his new residence. Subsequently, they apprehended Xu Agao, an accomplice of He Sanda, and handed them over to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Zhang Tianyin, a clerk at the police station, explained the situation and requested an extension of the detention, stating that the factory owner would be brought to the station to identify the stolen goods. Following Zhang Yunsheng's report detailing the case's progress, the presiding judge, Mr. Huang Risheng, found the defendants’ testimonies evasive and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.

### Sudden Recovery, Old Stomach Ailments Never Recurring, Word-of-Mouth Praise, Unforgettable with Every Meal

Many Chinese people suffer from stomach ailments, often enduring years of excruciating pain. Those with chronic conditions often accept it as a natural habit, paying no attention to it. However, the stomach is vital for nourishment and cannot be ignored. Stomach ailments can range from mild stomach "sluggishness" to severe food intolerance. Reduced nutrient absorption can negatively impact overall health, leading to muscle loss, weakened resistance, and susceptibility to various diseases. Even those who understand the importance of nutrition may suffer for years due to a lack of effective treatment. Fortunately, there is a "One Seven Zero Wan Stomach Medicine," which can instantly relieve stomach pain within minutes. Once taken, the ailment vanishes as if it never existed. Users are amazed by its miraculous effect.

### No Worry of Frostbite, A Miracle in a Small Bottle

In the frigid winter, when the words "Ruyi Ling Frostbite Pearl" are mentioned, hands, feet, and exposed parts of the body are prone to frostbite. Although not a major illness, the pain is excruciating and makes walking difficult. It can last for a long time, and if left untreated, the affected area may ulcerate, which is difficult to heal until spring. Moreover, the scars left behind are unsightly, which is particularly distressing for young women. People often dismiss this as insignificant, and effective remedies are rare. Zhengxun Gravel Modification has created two types of medication at the intersection of Yinhua Street and Yima Road to meet the urgent needs of winter: (1) "Frostbite Ruyi Water," specifically for treating non-ulcerated frostbite, whether it is recent or has been present for days.

Those suffering from frostbite should not hesitate and use it immediately. The price of "Frostbite Ruyi Water" is 25 cents per bottle, and "Pearl White Deep Paste" is 40 cents per box.

### Winter Tonics, Cod Liver Oil Sees Strong Sales, "Weiling" Brand Particularly Active

Since the onset of winter in Shanghai, sales of tonics have steadily increased, and due to the large-scale war, sales have exceeded those of previous years. According to investigations, "Weiling" brand cod liver oil preparations are particularly well-suited to the current climate and are experiencing robust sales. There are two types of tonics: positive and negative. Seeking tonics after falling ill and experiencing physical deficiencies, in order to restore one's original health, is considered negative tonification. On the other hand, taking precautions and strengthening the body to enhance its ability to resist disease is considered positive tonification. The proverb says, "Better to prepare than to repair," meaning it is better to "return and suddenly trick" than to "burn your head off". However, the nutritional value of rice, wheat, fish, and vegetables varies, and the physical strength of individuals can differ significantly. Scientists believe that this is due to a deficiency of vitamins in the body. Therefore, in the cold winter, a highly nutritious tonic is essential. Experts recognize cod liver oil as the superior choice. However, the cod liver oil produced in the northern countries and imported to our country varies in quality among different manufacturers, and the speed of efficacy also differs. Those with a strong fishy taste are difficult to swallow. Only "Weiling Pure Clear Cod Liver Oil" is the best among pure cod liver oils. It is pure, with few impurities, and has no fishy taste, making it easy to swallow. It is also made in a concentrated form, increasing its efficacy compared to other similar products. Cod liver oil contains vitamins A and D, making it an effective medicine for nourishing yin, moisturizing the lungs, treating coughs, preventing tuberculosis, nourishing the marrow, supplementing blood, strengthening muscles, and strengthening bones. "Weiling Pure Clear Cod Liver Oil" is dense and effective, and it is purchased directly in large quantities, making it affordable. This is good news for those who take cod liver oil. In addition, there is "Drinking Malt Extract Fish Oil," which is made by combining "Pure Clear Cod Liver Oil" with genuine condensed barley malt extract, as well as fragrant and delicious ingredients, carefully prepared. Therefore, "Weiling Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil" contains vitamins A, B, and D, and is especially fragrant and delicious, suitable for the elderly and children. As a winter tonic, it is unparalleled. Recently, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Weiling Pharmacy, both types of cod liver oil are being sold with a buy-one-get-one-free promotion to reward customers.

### New Trends in National Vocational Education After the War (Continued)

(4) Holding Summer Seminars for Teachers of Agricultural Vocational Schools

Agricultural education in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces urgently needs guidance and promotion. The Ministry of Education will convene principals and chief teachers of public and private agricultural vocational schools in these provinces at the Agricultural College of National Central University in Chongqing during this summer vacation to hold summer seminars. The seminars will be divided into three groups: agronomy, forestry, and horticulture, with a duration of six weeks. More than thirty schools with a total of over fifty students will participate.

(5) Subsidizing Excellent Vocational Schools

The Ministry of Education has allocated 140,000 yuan from the central production education funds for the 27th year to be used to reward and advance excellent public and private vocational schools in various provinces. The principle of subsidization is mainly to assist industrial vocational schools in enriching mechanical equipment, followed by agriculture and medical affairs. A total of thirteen schools have been subsidized, including five schools in Sichuan Province, one school in Guizhou Province, three schools in Yunnan Province, one school in Guangxi Province, one school in Hunan Province, one school in Shaanxi Province, and one school in Gansu Province. At the same time, the provincial and municipal governments are ordered to provide equal subsidies.

(6) Inspecting Agricultural and Industrial Education in the Southwest and Northwest Provinces

In order to promote secondary agricultural and industrial education in the southwest and northwest provinces, the Ministry of Education, in addition to holding seminars for agricultural teachers, has also selected personnel with rich knowledge and experience in agricultural and industrial education, such as Ye Fangzhe, Wang Wenzhong, Yu Zhisong, Zhang Pijie, Tang Zhicai, and An Shinong, to go to various provinces for inspection, guidance, and improvement.

(7) Stipulating Registration Methods for Technical Personnel

In order to meet urgent needs, the Ministry of Education has issued a notice to various provinces and designated schools to run various vocational training classes to train middle and lower-level cadres and technical personnel. However, due to the lack of qualified technical personnel in the teaching staff to serve as instructors, six methods for registering technical personnel in various industries have been specifically formulated in various cities, with a deadline for implementation. The registers will be submitted to the Ministry for selection of talents. At the same time, public and private vocational schools are ordered to list the qualifications, experience, and expertise of all vocational subject teachers and submit them for overall planning.

(8) Investigating Local Farmers' Experience

The Ministry of Education believes that improving agricultural education should first focus on practice and eliminate the past abuses of mere formality. Therefore, it has decided to first investigate the good experience accumulated by farmers in various places over thousands of years, and then integrate it with modern agricultural science, to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The scope of the investigation includes eleven categories: 1. Farmland water conservancy, 2. Forests, 3. Crops, 4. Fruit tree cultivation, 5. Forest nursery sowing, 6. Vegetable cultivation, 7. Agricultural product manufacturing, 8. Popular climate prediction, 9. Farm implements, 10. Livestock, 11. Livestock diseases, etc. The investigation items have been specified, the forms have been prepared, and they have been distributed to agricultural schools in various provinces and cities for thorough investigation.

National Central Vocational School of Industry

The new school buildings have not yet been completed and are currently under construction. It is expected that most of them will be completed within this month. More than 340 new and old students started classes as early as the end of October last year, and their morale is still good. The National Central Midwifery School has found a location for the maternity hospital and is under construction. It is expected to be completed by the end of February. The school is running smoothly, and there are many outpatients and pregnant women admitted to the hospital. The National Central Nursing School is temporarily running in Guizhou Province. It is now planned to set up a branch school in Sichuan Province to meet the needs.

Medical Education

Including midwifery and nursing education, it has recently attracted the attention of the general public. In addition to the one school directly run by the central government, a new school has been established in Sichuan Province. In addition, border provinces such as Xikang are also planning to add schools this year. As for the existing schools in various places, the Ministry of Education intends to send personnel to inspect them in the near future and actively urge them to enrich and improve. (End)

### School Overview: Zhang's Guoxue (National Studies) Lecture Series

Zhang's Guoxue Lecture Series was founded by Zhang Taiyan, a master of Guoxue, with the aim of studying inherent culture and cultivating Guoxue talents. It was established in April 1935, and its venue was built on Jinfan Road in Suzhou. It is divided into two departments: lectures and scripture reading. In addition to Mr. Zhang personally giving lectures, the lecturers include Mr. Zhang's top student Zhu Xizu and more than 20 others. Many students come from afar, about 200 people. The formal course of study is limited to two years, and the journal *Zhiyan* (Words of Wisdom) is published semi-monthly, with Mr. Zhang himself serving as the chief editor, and Pan Chengbi, Shen Yanguo, and Sun Shiyang serving as editors. Zheng Weiye served as the general affairs officer. All the articles published are Guoxue essays, which are well received by scholars at home and abroad. In the summer of 1936, Mr. Zhang passed away. Mrs. Zhang Taiyan, Tang Guoli, took on the important task of continuing the lectures in order to pass on the teachings. In order to expand the school, a board of directors was organized, inviting Mr. Zhang's lifelong friends Yu Youren, Li Genyuan, Shen Enfu, Shen Zumiian, Ju Zheng, Bai Wenwei, Ma Xiangbo, Ma Junwu, Chen Taoyi, Zhang Ji, Zhang Zhiben, Zhang Yi, Zhang Junli, Zhang Dongsun, Feng Ziyou, Yang Shukan, Yang Pusheng, Deng Bangshu, Deng Jiayan, Ye Chuqiang, Jiang Zuobin, Jiang Weiqiao, Chu Fucheng, and Han Guojun to serve as directors. A board of directors was also organized, composed of Tang Guoli, Zhu Xizu, Wang Dong, Jin Yusui, Ma Zonghuo, Wang Chenglu, Zhu Zugeng, Pan Chengbi, Shen Yanguo, Long Muxun, Sun Shiyang, Pan Chonggui, and Huang Zhuo, with Mrs. Zhang Taiyan serving as the chairman of the board of directors. They then raised funds and jointly determined the course of action. The regular courses continued to be lectured, and in addition to continuing to print *Zhiyan* semi-monthly, a preparatory course was added. Mr. Zhang's old friends Wang Xiaoxu and Shen Diemin, etc., and more than 20 of Mr. Zhang's top students were invited to give lectures. The school's expenses were 10,000 yuan per year, which was donated by Mr. Zhang privately, so the students were all free of charge. The first class of regular and preparatory students graduated. The school was about to expand when the war broke out, Suzhou fell, and the school was suspended. Now the directors and members of the board of directors are meeting in Shanghai to jointly plan the restoration of the school, add additional directors such as Yin Yin, Xu Langxi, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Zhiming, and Xiang Longxun, and jointly elect Ma Xiangbo as the chairman of the board of directors. The internal organization is divided into three departments: the Research Department, the *Zhiyan* Society, and the Taiyan College of Literature and its affiliated middle school. Huang Pu was hired as the director of the Research Department to handle the department's affairs. Dozens of researchers in Shanghai, such as Zhang Wenshu, Wang Juan, Wang Yuanchong, Zhu Xuehao, Shi Zejing, and Jin Dejian, etc., are conducting the compilation of Mr. Zhang's collection of books, the selection and annotation of Mr. Zhang's essays, and the compilation of the Chinese general history. The *Zhiyan* Society decided to change *Zhiyan* to a monthly magazine, and the 48th issue is scheduled to be published in the middle of this month. Mrs. Zhang Taiyan was invited to serve as the president of the Taiyan College of Literature, and Sun Shiyang, Shen Yanguo, Zhu Zugeng, Wang Chenglu, Zheng Weiye, and Pan Chengbi were appointed as secretaries, deans of academic affairs, deans of students, accounting, and librarians, respectively. The departments temporarily set up include the Chinese Literature Department, the Chinese History and Geography Department, and the Chinese Literature Specialization. Zai Dong, Zhu Xizu, and Long Muxun serve as the professors, all of whom are scholars with deep academic expertise and high reputation.

The affiliated middle school of the college is strict in discipline and education, focusing on Chinese, English, arithmetic, physics, and chemistry. In addition to the professors of the college serving as Chinese history teachers, the other teachers are all graduates of famous universities at home and abroad. The school has leased the Wuzhou Building on Henan Road as the college site and is scheduled to open in the spring of this semester.

### International Cup Football Semi-Final: Hualian Suffers Crushing Defeat; Loses 5-0; Portugal Gains Final Rights

Yesterday was warm as spring. The International Cup football semi-final between Hualian and Portugal kicked off at 10:30 AM at Yiyuan. No less than seven thousand people, attracted by the fame, watched from the sidelines, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Hualian still fielded the same lineup that defeated England, but the loss of the central defense line led to a lack of coordination in attack and defense. Goalkeeper Zhou Dayun was in poor form yesterday and gifted at least three goals. Central defender Xu Chenghun's inability to contain the fierce Fafanxiao was also a major reason for the defeat. The Portuguese team's lineup was indeed very strong, with Fafanxiao, Corassa, and Rocha Liao in front, and Ma Shan'er, Weiketai, and Kaositan coordinating in the middle. Although Hualian had "Iron Leg," Ade, and Yichen, they could not take one step over the Lei Pool. With few opportunities to score, and even those being off target, a one-sided situation was formed. In the first half, the Portuguese team took the lead with a score of 1-0. In the end, Hualian lost five goals, shocking all seven thousand fans. Now that Hualian has been惨惨 eliminated, this year's cup will be a battle between Portugal and the Soviet Union. The lineups of both sides in yesterday's match are as follows:

Portugal:

Rocha Liao

Ma Shan'er, Weiketai'ao

V Su Ruo, Kaositan, Lie Weila

C Lei Mide, I Rocha Liao, Fafanxiao, Corassa, L Lei Mide

Hualian Team:

Zhou Dayun

Zhuang Youren, Zhang Lingen

Meng Yiliang, Xu Chenghun, Jiang Zhaoxiang

Wan Xianghua, Li Qunchen, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang

Dayun Panicked and Lost the First Goal

As the whistle blew to start the match, the Portuguese team attacked first but failed. "Iron Leg" passed to Xiao Wan, and Xiao Wan tried his toe, but it was caught and thrown out by goalkeeper Rocha Liao. Xiao Wan sent it remotely, and Ma Shan'er stumbled, but Sun "Iron Leg" was a step late, to no avail. Youliang assisted Ade in attacking the goal but was blocked. Xiao Wan rushed in from the left and hooked the ball to the center, Ade yielded to "Iron Leg," who was blocked by Ma Shan'er, and kicked the ball high, over the crossbar. After Corassa's shot went wide, Jia Youliang killed past Lao Ma, but "Iron Leg's" toe was ineffective, and it was all in vain. The Portuguese team, having repeatedly survived dangerous situations, took the opportunity to attack. Lao Si passed remotely in front of the goal, and C Lei Mide rushed up, but was saved by Dayun. L Rocha Liao and I Lei Mide advanced side by side, and Meng Yiliang blocked them into a corner kick. Fafanxiao took the corner, and Rocha Liao headed it to the back, then returned to his feet and shot powerfully at the goal from fourteen yards. Dayun panicked, caught it and then lost it, and it rolled into the corner of the goal, opening the scoring. This was exactly twenty minutes after the start of the match. The Portuguese team attacked again, and the Hualian penalty area was full of danger. Kaositan and Fafanxiao headed in succession, but both were ineffective. Xiao Wan's hook shot missed, and Ade and Yichen also tried headers, one being blocked and the other going over the crossbar. Then, Xiao Wan received a pass from Youliang and swept across the goal, but A Rocha Liao dived and turned it into a corner kick. Hualian failed to score repeatedly, and the first half ended with a score of 0-1.

A Thousand Miles Lost; Hualian Suffers a Crushing Defeat

As the second half began, C Lei Mide's shot was caught. Xiao Wan advanced but was blocked by Ma Shan'er and retreated. Then the ball was passed out from Hualian's territory again. After several passes, the entire Portuguese team advanced outwards. Weiketai defended the rear. Sun "Iron Leg" got a one-on-one opportunity and poked the ball into the net, but the referee had already blown the whistle, judging a foul by the Portuguese team. It was all for naught. Hualian suffered this setback, and morale was depressed. Su Ruo sent remotely to Corassa, who shot powerfully, but it hit the goal and bounced out, a very dangerous moment. Hualian counterattacked, but Yichen's shot went wide again. Then the Portuguese team launched another fierce attack, and the Hualian goal area was in danger again. Kaositan remotely tapped, but it was caught. Li Yichen dribbled out and passed to Ade, who poked it in the middle. Sun dodged, intending to let Youliang shoot, but Ma Shan'er rushed out and snatched it away. After fifteen minutes, the Portuguese team got a corner kick opportunity. C Lei Mide's corner was very good, and Fafanxiao volleyed from twelve yards, hitting the net. (2-0) Then Youliang's left-footed shot went askew. Meng Yiliang suddenly fouled, and Olivilai took a free kick from thirty yards. The ball flew towards the goal, and Dayun jumped up and missed, but Zhang Lingen saved the dangerous situation. One wave had not subsided, and another rose. At twenty-three minutes, Fafanxiao got the ball and hooked it from the right of the goal. The ball was fast and steep, and Dayun repeated the mistake of the first goal, sliding into the net. (3-0) Yichen and Xiao Wan exchanged positions after this, but still made no progress. At thirty-eight minutes, Kaositan passed to C Lei Mide, who hooked it to Rocha Liao, who passed it to Corassa, who scored with one kick (4-0). Not five minutes later, also Rocha Liao shot from the left of the goal, and Dayun did not make a save, letting it roll into the corner of the goal. Time ran out, and Hualian suffered a crushing defeat of 0-5. The Portuguese team won the right to the final.

### Sexual Health: Health After Marriage

— Yang Daonan, graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University

The Secret to a Long and Happy Marriage

The wedding night is the happiest event in one's life. However, if both husband and wife do not have healthy bodies, it can often lead to great tragedy, causing lifelong misfortune. Therefore, a person must be careful at all times from being unmarried to getting married. The first thing to pay attention to in daily hygiene is to absolutely maintain virginity before marriage.

Many ignorant young people think that keeping virginity before marriage is the sole responsibility of women, and that men have almost no need to bear this obligation. This absurd prejudice is indeed the main cause of post-marital tragedies.

It is true that men are more promiscuous before marriage than women who do not observe chastity before marriage. Masturbation can be said to be the starting point of male promiscuity. After excess, the essence is exhausted and the brain is drained. Not only do annoying wrinkles appear early on his face, he loses the plumpness of his appearance, and his physique becomes weaker, but his reproductive function rapidly declines, and he heads down the path of premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, and neurasthenia, making his future life endlessly miserable!

Some people say that married life is conducive to health. Their research shows that married people have fewer illnesses and lower mortality rates than single and widowed people. However, please do not misunderstand, the married life mentioned in the previous section refers to those who can maintain their virginity before marriage and engage in regular reproductive processes after marriage. If one is promiscuous before marriage and indulges in lust after marriage, then health after marriage will disappear even more quickly, presenting a premature aging phenomenon, with weak kidneys, reproductive dysfunction, and a gradual decrease in the heat of love. Lifespans are shortened, and there are many who sacrifice all sorts of bright futures because of marriage.

Good health is the mother of all successful careers. This is a truly wise saying, because happiness and love between husband and wife after marriage cannot escape this rule either. Although a fulfilling and happy marriage depends entirely on many successful factors, such as matching interests, sufficient property, harmonious temperament, and a comfortable environment, abundant energy is indeed the most important factor. Because after having abundant energy, one has a strong physique and a ruddy complexion on the outside, and sufficient wisdom and liveliness on the inside. In short, a healthy man is better than a weak man at protecting his family and enhancing the love between husband and wife. Of course, in fact, it cannot be said that there are no cases of men accidentally falling in love with low-ability women, and women being attracted to men who have lost their health due to material inducements, but these are errors in love, not the ideals of love. They will regret it once they discover these errors. Therefore, instead of regretting it afterwards, it is better to take "Biotecum," a German testicular essence preparation for men to promote metabolism and enhance reproductive function. It has miraculous effects within 24 hours after taking it for premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, neurasthenia, and other symptoms. If you feel that your essence and blood are deficient after marriage, one dose will cure you, guaranteeing lasting love and a long and happy marriage. Women who have been infertile for a long time or who have premature aging and irregular menstruation can take "Biotecum" for women.

New Doctor Magazine, Issue 17, Rules for Asking About Illness

In order to serve the community, this publication has specially engaged graduates from domestic and foreign medical universities to answer letters. Please include sufficient postage for a reply, and clearly state your name, address, source of illness, and symptoms, and send it to the editorial department of Xin Yi Lin, No. 869 Wuding Road.

### Effective Rescue Methods for Masturbation and Nocturnal Emission — Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Regarding the damage to body and mind caused by masturbation, almost everyone knows it. However, its changes in nerves and intelligence are also worthy of attention. Masturbation patients are mediocre and easily irritable, with a great ability to be provoked. They toss and turn in bed and cannot sleep peacefully. They yawn frequently when they wake up in the morning and feel more tired than the night before. Their attention is weak, and they often suffer from headaches and nocturnal emission. Their personality becomes deceitful, self-deprecating, and cowardly. One can see from their haggard appearance that their hearts are not at peace and their physical strength is exhausted. Their appearance is decadent, making people disgusted to see them. Their eyes are lifeless, with dark circles around them. Their hands are ice-cold, and their steps are unsteady and difficult. In other words, a young man who was full of energy, strong, and innocent a few years or months ago has now transformed into a haggard and miserable photograph, suffering from devastation.

To avoid masturbation, the first thing to do is to make young people fully aware of its harm. On the negative side, do not allow them to read obscene and licentious stories and novels, and focus on physical training so that their attention is concentrated on the pleasures of physical and mental activity. As for the medicinal supplements after masturbation, one can use neurasthenia therapy and actively take "Biotecum," a testicular essence preparation for men, which is the most reliable. After taking it, brainpower is enhanced, muscles become stronger, and if nocturnal emission is frequent, one should also take "Naires Nocturnal Emission Pills," which have the effect of stopping nocturnal emission that night.

### The True and Correct Method for Treating Leukorrhea

— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

Of all the venereal diseases, gonorrhea is the most difficult to cure, and therefore the invention of an effective cure for gonorrhea has been the slowest. This is because the viruses involved are very persistent, and it is impossible to completely eliminate them in a short time with over-the-counter medicines that claim to cure the disease in three or five days. To cure gonorrhea, a certain course of treatment must be followed. To say that gonorrhea can be cured in three or five days with internal medicine is like trying to climb a ten-thousand-foot peak in one step. Even a three-foot-tall child would not believe such an exaggerated claim. How easy is it to find an effective internal medicine for gonorrhea? Consider Dr. Peter's invention of the gonorrhea-specific drug "Clinon," which was invented after devoting his life's work and over thirty years of research. It is very different from those superficial people and inexperienced youngsters who lightly talk about special medicines and make reckless statements, resulting in adverse reactions in reality. "Clinon" is made from a special protein-pigment mixture based on the latest scientific theories of modern gonorrhea treatment, rather than specific therapy. Taking it causes each cell to develop an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect, so it is especially effective for acute and chronic gonorrhea, as well as gonococcal prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, seminal vesiculitis, vas deferens inflammation, and gonococcal leukorrhea in women, which are generally ineffective with medicines on the market. Taking "Clinon" can completely and fundamentally solve these problems in two or three weeks for mild cases and four or five weeks for severe cases. Therefore, it has won the trust of medical experts around the world. I ask, can an internal medicine that claims to cure leukorrhea in three or five days have this kind of credibility?

### Gonorrhea Lecture: Dr. Yao Juyan's Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road: Polyarticular Gonococcal Arthritis

The Course of This Disease

Polyarticular gonococcal arthritis has various causes, mostly due to excessive activity and mistreatment. Gonococci often flow through the blood to the joints due to the stimulation of activity and attach to the joints, so the affected joints often appear red and swollen. In addition, drinking alcohol and sexual activity can easily lead to this disease. So-called polyarticular arthritis is characterized by inflammation flowing to various joints, but generally speaking, it is mostly in the large joints of various parts, such as both knees, both shoulders, both elbows, and finger joints, where inflammation and swelling occur. However, it also wanders around without a fixed location. When the inflammation in one joint subsides slightly, it starts in another joint. Or it may also be complicated by endocarditis at the same time. If this persists for a long time without healing, the whole body may become paralyzed and disabled.

The Lesson from the Past

In the past, gonorrhea patients often received local treatment and indiscriminately took over-the-counter medicines that claimed to eradicate the disease in three or five days. Local treatment can only kill bacteria locally and cannot eliminate gonococci that are close to guerrilla warfare. As for medicines that can cure the disease in three or five days, they are even less reliable. Countless people have already failed with these two treatments, which can serve as a lesson from the past. Based on my nearly twenty years of clinical experience and observations from various sources, I use German static electricity and X-ray therapy alternately. On the one hand, I use German anti-gonococcal serum to break down the solidified inflamed joints. At the same time, I take the gonorrhea holy medicine "Clinon" internally to eliminate gonococci scattered in the joints, thus quickly curing the disease and restoring the joints to their natural extension. Consultation hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. From today, twenty consultation numbers will be issued every day, with a fee of only five cents per number.

### Don't Be Pessimistic About Blood in Sputum: Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Blood in sputum can certainly startle patients. But it is not absolutely a terminal illness. But it is also not something that can be ignored. In our medical practice, we often encounter cases of bleeding from lung capillaries. Upon examination, the cause is not lung disease. And many people have no blood spots in their sputum, but examination of the sputum reveals that it is full of tuberculosis bacteria. Therefore, in my clinical practice, I advise patients to take absolute care of their health. If it is lung disease, generally speaking, it has probably reached the second or third stage.

I have been treating lung disease for more than three years and feel that the internal medicines that have come out recently have not achieved the effect of radical cure. Among them, the medicine "Bufei Na'er" does have the effect of searching for tuberculosis and nourishing the lungs. This medicine has the effect of directly eliminating tuberculosis bacteria, resolving phlegm, relieving coughs, and coagulating blood. It can also relieve hectic fever and night sweats and promote appetite. All stages of lung disease can be cured radically.

### Economic Retaliation by Britain and the United States Against Japan: Bai

Since the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, Japan has been clamoring for the establishment of a "New Order in East Asia," implementing economic monopoly in the occupied areas and excluding the interests of third countries. In North China, it implements trade controls, and in Central China, it refuses to allow ships from third countries to navigate the Yangtze River under the pretext of smuggling arms and dangerous navigation. Therefore, Japanese goods currently account for more than half of the value of imported goods in North China. In the Yangtze River basin, Japanese goods have also jumped from third place to first place. The so-called principle of open door and equal opportunity has been fundamentally broken. Recently, Japan has openly claimed that the old principles of the Nine-Power Treaty are no longer applicable to the new situation, and even wants to unilaterally break the treaty. Under this status, Britain and the United States have to decide whether to withdraw from the Far East or not. Since the Opium War, Britain has painstakingly managed its business in China for decades and has established a foundation. In recent years, although trade with China has declined, investment still ranks first. Although the United States has less investment, its trade often ranks first. Therefore, Britain and the United States are unwilling to give up their past efforts and withdraw from the Chinese market. Recently, due to the ineffectiveness of protests, they have considered economic retaliation.

The Effectiveness of Economic Sanctions

Since the failure of the League of Nations' economic sanctions against Italy during the Italo-Ethiopian War, there have been quite a few people who doubt the effectiveness of economic sanctions. The Italo-Ethiopian War broke out in early October 1935. In November, the League of Nations convened a meeting and decided to impose economic sanctions on Italy. Of the 58 member states of the League of Nations, except for the two parties involved, Italy and Ethiopia, and Austria, Hungary, Albania, and Paraguay, which refused to impose sanctions, 52 countries participated in the sanctions. The sanctions included: financial isolation, and trade bans on imports of Italian goods and exports of military supplies, mineral products, and metals to Italy. After the implementation of the League of Nations' sanctions, Italy also used the means of boycotting the import of goods from participating countries as retaliation, and implemented controls on finance, trade, and consumption as countermeasures. In addition, Italy is a country with an import surplus, and in recent years, the import surplus has often been more than 200 million lire. Germany and the United States are its largest trading partners. Germany accounts for the largest share of both imports and exports, accounting for 17% of imports and 16% of exports. The United States ranks second. However, these two countries are non-member states and have no obligation to fulfill the League of Nations' resolutions. Japan and Brazil are also the same. Some member states, such as Switzerland, Romania, and Yugoslavia, also claimed that they had close trade relations with Italy and declared reservations about the sanctions. The steps taken by various countries were inconsistent, and the methods were not thorough. For example, coal and gasoline were never prohibited from being exported to Italy. Therefore, the League of Nations' sanctions failed to stop Italy's war of aggression. In June 1936, Britain took the lead in advocating the lifting of sanctions against Italy, and other countries followed suit. The scene of economic sanctions in modern history ended here.

The Impact of Economic Sanctions on Japan

The military situation of Japan is different from that of Italy. The Italo-Ethiopian War lasted only half a year, and then it ended. The effectiveness of economic sanctions was not seen, and Ethiopia was lost. Japan has been using force against China for a year and a half, and two sets of capital have been exhausted (Yosuke Matsuoka said that Japan has three sets of capital: government reserves, social idle funds, and civilian resources), and the end of the war is nowhere in sight. The formation of the Hiranuma cabinet is intended to strengthen fascist rule and requisition civilian resources in order to achieve its goals. However, trapped in the quagmire in China, and encountering external shocks, it will be difficult to sustain.

The international trade situation between Japan and Italy is also completely different. Economic sanctions against Japan were advocated by Britain and the United States, and Japan's trade with Britain and the United States accounts for about half of its total trade. In 1937, Japanese goods shipped to Britain and its territories reached 900 million yen, and goods shipped to the United States also reached 600 million yen, accounting for half of Japan's export trade. In the same year, goods from Britain and its territories shipped to Japan reached 120 million yen, and US goods shipped to Japan also reached 127 million yen, accounting for two-thirds of Japan's import trade. Japan's trade relationship with Britain and the United States is so huge that the serious impact of economic sanctions by Britain and the United States can be imagined.

From the perspective of trade goods between the United States and Japan, silk is the largest commodity shipped from Japan to the United States, accounting for about 300 million yen annually, followed by cotton cloth, accounting for about 50 million yen annually, followed by clothing and porcelain, pottery, etc. Cotton is the most shipped from the United States to Japan, accounting for about 300 million yen annually, followed by coal, gasoline, and metal products, each accounting for about 100 million yen, followed by military equipment and machinery, etc. In terms of trade volume, the United States has a trade surplus and Japan has a trade deficit. The United States has an advantage. In terms of the nature of the goods, the goods shipped from the United States to Japan are mostly necessities, such as coal, gasoline, metal products, and machinery, which are necessary for Japan's national defense and industry. Even cotton, due to the fact that China's production is not enough to meet Japan's needs, is an indispensable raw material. The goods shipped from Japan to the United States are consumer goods. If the United States imposes commercial sanctions on Japan, there will be no adverse effects in the country, while Japan will suffer significant losses. For example, if the sales of raw silk are cut off, Japan's rural economy will be hit.

The trade situation between Britain and Japan is the same as that between the United States and Japan. Seafood and food are the largest commodities shipped from Japan to mainland Britain, reaching 30 million yen annually, followed by raw silk and cotton cloth. Machinery and boats are the largest commodities shipped from mainland Britain to Japan, accounting for about 20 million yen annually, followed by metal products. British goods are necessities, Japanese goods are consumer goods, and Japan also has a trade surplus, so Japan has the greatest advantage in British-Japanese trade. As for the trade situation between Japan and British territories, it is almost a exchange of manufactured goods and raw materials. For example, Japan imports 300 million yen worth of cotton from India annually, while it exports 200 million yen worth of cotton textiles to India annually. Australia ships about 100 million yen worth of wool to Japan annually, and 20 million yen worth of wheat, while Japan ships 50 million yen worth of cotton textiles to Australia. If British colonies cut off trade with Japan, Japan will lack markets for its finished products and sources for its raw materials, and its industry will be suffocated.

Recent Trade Statistics Between Japan, Britain, and the United States (Unit: Million Yen)

Why Haven't Britain and the United States Launched Economic Sanctions?

Japan is poor in resources and relies on foreign trade. The economic pressure from Britain and the United States would be a fatal blow to Japan. Why haven't Britain and the United States taken active action? The political reasons are beyond the scope of my discussion. The commercial reasons are the obstruction of some businessmen. For example, cotton and metal traders in India, wool and wheat merchants in Australia, and cotton, machinery, coal, and gasoline traders in the United States are all opposed to sanctions against Japan due to their own interests. The British and American governments are also worried about mutual retaliation and causing serious disputes. US Senator Pittman said that economic sanctions could bring aggressors to justice, while Senator Borah said that economic sanctions could lead to war. Whether economic sanctions are sufficient to cause war is theoretically uncertain and depends on the actual situation. The key question is whether Japan can resist Britain and the United States economically and militarily. I believe that if Britain and the United States form a united front and are determined to curb Japanese aggression, the Japanese militarists may not take the risk of acting rashly. However, the fear of war on the part of Britain and the United States is sufficient to fuel the arrogance of the aggressor countries and allow them to use their intimidation tactics. Last September, the League of Nations asked its member states to provide individual economic assistance to China and impose sanctions on Japan. The Japanese government spokesman threatened that if the powers changed their neutrality, Japan would consider its attitude towards foreign concessions in China. The interests of Britain and the United States in China are mostly in Shanghai. According to statistics from C. F. Remer, British investment in China is US$119 million, with Shanghai accounting for three-quarters. US investment in China is US$190 million, with Shanghai accounting for 64%. In addition, British and American investment in Japan, according to "The Problem of International Investment" published by the Royal Institute of International Affairs in 1937, reached US$440 million by the end of 1933, mostly government bonds, which is more than double the investment in China. British investment in Japan in 1930 was estimated at £63 million, which is only a quarter of the US$119 million invested in China. However, according to an estimate by Robert Kindersley published in the December 1937 issue of the Economic Journal, British investment in Japan at the end of 1936 was £53 million (mostly government bonds), and investment in China was £41 million. That is, British investment in Japan is greater than its investment in China, which is contrary to the results of Remer's estimate. The exact situation remains to be verified. In short, whether the investment is in Japan or China, it is under the control of the Japanese. Perhaps Britain and the United States are hesitant to implement strict economic sanctions against Japan because they fear damaging their own interests?

Comparison of the Advantages and Disadvantages of British and American Retaliation

The difficulties that Britain encounters in retaliating against Japan in commerce are temporary. From the perspective of the entire British Empire's economy, it can be said to be beneficial. For example, the British textile industry has always felt the pain of Japanese competition. After the sanctions against Japan, although the import of cotton from India and wool from Australia to Japan will be reduced, the British cotton and wool spinning industries will certainly flourish, and cotton and wool raw materials can be absorbed by mainland Britain. The same is true for US cotton. Before World War I, Japan imported only 1 million bales of foreign cotton annually, while Britain imported 4 million bales. Later, due to the prosperity of the Japanese textile industry and the decline of Britain, and in 1935, Japan's imports of foreign cotton increased to 3.6 million bales, while Britain's imports decreased to 2 million bales. The world's cotton trade volume has always been around 12 million bales (each bale weighs 500 pounds gross and 478 pounds net) without major fluctuations. Therefore, the sales of US cotton can still return to Britain. Other US goods such as coal, gasoline, and machinery do not rely on Japan as a customer. As for worrying about Japan's so-called retaliation, the movements of Britain and the United States regarding loans to China show that this is unlikely to happen.

### The Process of England and Japan Arbitrarily Handling Shanghai Customs: A Dispatch from the Front

(I) The Cause of Negotiations

Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, Japanese shipments entering and leaving the Yangshupu and Hongkou districts, relying on their military force, have uniformly refused customs inspections. Simultaneously, Japanese goods have taken advantage of their tax-free status, massively dumping products in Shanghai. After our army retreated westward, unscrupulous merchants colluded with Japanese merchants, and the influx of smuggled goods surged even more. According to Japanese reports, in the first four months of the 27th year [1938], Japanese liaison ships came to Shanghai 13 times, and other ships 15 times, transporting a total of over 54,000 tons of goods. The main goods were rayon, sugar, piece goods, soybeans, soybean oil, cigarette paper, and seafood, which greatly impacted customs revenue.

Before the war, Shanghai customs revenue ranked first in the country, reaching 20 million yuan per month during prosperous times. At that time, it plummeted to approximately 4 million yuan per month. Bondholders of various foreign debts secured by customs revenue naturally became uneasy. Foreign capitalist classes, who prioritize profit over righteousness, had no concept of justice. The Japanese used the restoration of customs rights as bait, enticing the British to hold negotiations, coercing Shanghai customs to accept the new tax rates set by the puppet organization.

Negotiations began in February of the 27th year [1938], with the British ambassador to Japan engaging in discussions with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Initially, they proceeded secretively, deeply concerned about being discovered by the outside world. By the time negotiations concluded in May, they announced that the new tax rates would be officially implemented from June 1st. Thus, this illegal and privately conducted farce was completed.

(II) The Content of the Agreement

On May 3rd, Britain and Japan simultaneously announced a public statement regarding the Shanghai Customs talks. The text was very brief, only stipulating that after Shanghai customs revenue was used to repay foreign debt principal and interest, the remaining funds would be deposited in Yokohama Specie Bank. Nothing else was mentioned. What actually manifested after the agreement was established was that the Nanjing puppet organization appointed a puppet official as the Shanghai Customs Superintendent. Although anti-smuggling work resumed in the eastern district of Shanghai customs, the customs officers assigned were limited to Japanese or Western personnel. Of particular note was the implementation of the new tax rules, which eliminated customs surcharges but retained the disaster relief surcharge of 5%. Tax reductions on imported goods included cotton cloth, cotton yarn, cotton, cotton textiles, wool textiles, rayon, seafood, sugar, gasoline, cement, and miscellaneous goods, further benefiting Japanese imports. Furthermore, raw cotton and mineral products, which are raw materials for manufacturing munitions, were completely tax-exempt.

The original text of the Anglo-Japanese public statement on the Shanghai Customs talks is recorded below:

"Since February of this year (1938), the British Ambassador to Japan and the Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs have been conducting informal negotiations regarding the repayment of foreign debts secured by Chinese tariffs and other related matters. As a result of the exchange of views, the Japanese government has notified the British government of its proposed temporary measures to adjust this matter during wartime. In its reply, the British government stated to Japan that Britain did not oppose the implementation of these temporary wartime measures, and heard that the United States and France also did not intend to raise any objections. If economic conditions change drastically, these measures may be reconsidered. All taxes collected by customs at ports within Japanese-occupied areas will be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. From these deposits, the amount to be repaid for foreign debts will be allocated to the Inspector General of Customs to fully fulfill the obligations of foreign debts and reparations secured by tariffs. The repayment of these foreign debts and reparations must be regarded as the first item of expenditure after deducting customs administrative expenses and certain customs payments and subsidies from tariffs. The amount of foreign debt payable by each port will be determined monthly based on the percentage of the total customs revenue of all ports in the previous month accounted for by that port. The Boxer Indemnity due to Japan, deposited in HSBC since last September, will be paid to the Japanese government. In addition, measures will be taken to fulfill future payments of the Boxer Indemnity and the portion due to Japan in the 1913 Reorganization Loan, and to repay the overdraft of Shanghai Customs under the Shanghai foreign debt payment item accumulated by the Inspector General of Customs in HSBC this January. The surplus of tariffs in HSBC under various ports under Japanese occupation will be transferred to Yokohama Specie Bank for future offsetting of foreign debts."

(III) Reactions from Various Parties

A. Chinese Customs Staff Stage a Strike: Upon hearing that the puppet organization had appointed a puppet official as Customs Superintendent, all Chinese staff at Shanghai Customs were indignant. On the morning of May 7th, they went on strike and held a general meeting, resolving the following items: Requesting Inspector General of Customs, Luo Fude [presumably a transliteration of Robert L. Smyth] and Chinese Deputy Inspector General of Customs, Qiu Qiwei to come to the Customs House to explain what happened. Electing representatives to establish the Shanghai Customs Chinese Staff Protection Association, with the aim of protecting the integrity of the Customs. Electing 35 executive committee members to form the Executive Committee. Telegraphing the central government to explain the current situation, the circumstances of the strike, and requesting Minister Kong Xiangxi to clearly indicate how to handle it. Resolutely implementing the strike until a concrete solution is obtained.

After the five resolutions were passed, senior customs officials, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, attended to give instructions, earnestly advising that the Customs was a government agency with significant implications for shipping companies. Customs personnel should not leave their posts without orders from the government. Furthermore, the various rumors circulating were not factual, so they should not take action to avoid causing impact on all parties and providing excuses for others.

During the wave of unrest, there was also an incident of customs officers being kidnapped, who were later released after negotiations. Some were also transferred to other customs locations. The wave of unrest thus subsided.

B. Our Government's Protest: After news of the Customs negotiation agreement spread, our ambassador to Britain first raised two points to the British government in opposition: Britain recognized Japan's control of the tariffs of the eight ports in North China. The agreement did not include provisions for repaying domestic debts. After the agreement's public announcement, our government also submitted a diplomatic note to the British Foreign Office, stating that China would absolutely not be bound by the measures agreed upon by Britain and Japan, reserving China's complete right and freedom of action in its customs affairs, and denouncing the action of two foreign countries concluding an agreement on Chinese Customs without China's consent.

(IV) Situation After the Establishment of the Agreement

A. Japanese Imports Soar to First Place: Foreign trade has been greatly affected since the outbreak of the war, but has gradually recovered thereafter. Taking Shanghai as an example, Japanese imports in June of the 27th year [1938] were only worth 200,000 yuan, insignificant. In July, they soared to over 4 million yuan, over 2 million yuan in August, over 4 million yuan in September, and over 5 million yuan in October, soaring to the top spot for imports. Whether all goods entering and leaving Hongkou have been fully taxed remains a question.

Looking at the national conclusion, in January, the United States ranked first in imported goods, at 11,569,100 yuan, and Japan ranked eighth, at 2,418,000 yuan. In February, the United States ranked first, at 18,028,000 yuan, and Japan ranked fifth, at 6,023,000 yuan; In March, Germany ranked first, at 19,018,200 yuan, and Japan ranked fifth, at 10,227,000 yuan; In April, the United States ranked first, at 13,215,000 yuan, and Japan ranked second, at 10,210,000 yuan; In May, Japan ranked first, at 15,361,000 yuan; In June, Japan ranked first, at 18,372,000 yuan; In July, Japan ranked first, at 19,701,000 yuan; In August, Japan ranked first, at 23,825,000 yuan; In September, Japan ranked first, at 24,755,000 yuan; In October, Japan ranked first, at 20,125,000 yuan (all units are in thousands of yuan).

B. Smuggled Goods Still Abound: After the Customs Agreement was concluded, it was hoped that the smuggling of private goods would decrease. However, according to reports, woolen cloth, broadcloth, rayon, bean cakes, matches, canned fish, daily necessities, and other items are still being smuggled in large quantities, without paying customs duties. The selling prices are often one-third lower than market prices, which greatly affects legitimate businesses. According to a report on October 8th, although the Jianghai Customs has resumed anti-smuggling work in the eastern district of Shanghai, it is often hindered by military interference and cannot strictly enforce measures. The trend of smuggling and tax evasion is still rampant. Recently, imported smuggled goods have mainly been daily food items such as rice, white sugar, and salt. It is hoped that all businesses will not import goods of unknown origin. In summary, it can be seen that smuggled goods are still extremely abundant.

C. Customs Forced to Hang Puppet Flag: During the Customs Agreement negotiations, the flag-hanging issue was a major stumbling block. Related parties once indicated that the Customs would not fly any flag thereafter as a passive compromise. However, on November 4th, it was said that under the orders of puppet officials of the puppet organization, the Five-Colored Flag (a flag of a past regime in China) was hoisted high atop the Jianghai Customs building and on various customs vessels patrolling the Huangpu River. Onlookers were disapproving, and public opinion was in uproar, questioning the customs authorities in charge. The puppet flag was subsequently hoisted several times. According to Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Moyler, he had not received reports regarding the hanging of the puppet flag and had reported and requested instructions from the central government.

(V) The Failure of Seeking Skin from a Tiger

Regarding the Customs Agreement, some believe it to be a wartime expedient, expressing regret and stating that China will retain its right of action, with little other commentary. However, there are points worth noting: The original motive after the establishment of the agreement was to prevent smuggling, but smuggling continues as before. This is the first point. Secondly, despite pressure to protect commercial interests in China, the Yangtze River remains closed. The interests of those in China continue to be compromised, leading to further losses. Thirdly, the large remaining customs revenue after allocating for foreign debt and reparations, being deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, is akin to supplying the enemy with food, and is exploited by both Japan and the puppet regime. Foreign reporters have questioned Japanese spokespersons whether the "Reformed Government" has withdrawn or borrowed funds from miscellaneous taxes, using customs duties as collateral, to which the Japanese have avoided answering. Furthermore, the repayment of foreign debt is to maintain our foreign credit, but with the successive fall of Tianjin, Shanghai, and Qingdao Customs, their authority is no longer in our hands. Foreign reporters have also inquired with Japanese spokespersons whether the remaining funds deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank will be used to offset foreign debts secured by customs duties. The Japanese only used investigation as an excuse. All this was something the British did not foresee. However, after the incident, they have made considerable concessions to Japanese businesses. Shanghai Customs has allowed the Japanese shipping company to use Japanese bills of lading and fill out Japanese cargo manifests. Allowing a foreign language on the customs bill of lading of a country is not normal, yet English and other foreign languages are used, making it even more unthinkable. Can British politicians, who prioritize immediate reality over long-term planning, hope to maintain their Far East interests by seeking skin from a tiger? If the situation continues to normalize a de facto recognition through tacit cooperation, the loss of their rights in the future will not be limited to this. The Far East hope that Britain has cultivated for centuries has been deprived by its then-ally, Japan. How can it not be lamented?

### Last Year's Wheat Harvest Was Bumper; Resolution of the International Wheat Advisory Committee; Deliberating on a Wheat Control Plan

Reuters, London, 14th: At a meeting held after the signing of the International Wheat Advisory Committee, a report was selected. The main proposal of the report was to convene an international conference to formulate an effective wheat control plan. The meeting also decided to nominate representatives from Canada, Argentina, the United States, Australia, the Soviet Union, Romania, Hungary, and Britain, Germany, and France, along with a chairman, to form a preparatory committee for the conference. This committee can cooperate with representatives from the International Institute of Agriculture and seek opinions from representatives of other countries, wheat and flour industry exporters, and economists. The preparatory committee has absolute freedom in preparing the final agenda but must pay special attention to the following points: The necessity of cooperation between exporting and importing countries; Considerations for an international agreement with a famine period as the term; The minimum level of international grain prices; The issue of export subsidies; Allocation of export quotas based on estimated world demand ratios. The preparatory committee will report to the Advisory Committee, which will make the final determination on the specific issues to be resolved by the international conference. The Advisory Committee yesterday discussed a report on the relationship between nutrition policy and world wheat, proposed by the Australian representative, Mr. McDougall. After expressing views on several points, the committee decided to appoint a subcommittee to draft a report on this matter.

Last Year's Bumper Harvest

Without understanding the global wheat harvest situation, it is impossible to understand the contents of the aforementioned conference. With the Second World War looming, increasing wheat production has been listed as an important task in the war preparedness sequence of major powers. According to the agricultural monthly report recently published by the International League of Nations, the area of world wheat fields (excluding Soviet Russia) last year was 111.2 million hectares, more than the 107 million hectares of the previous year, an increase of more than 5 million hectares. In addition, various parties have widely adopted mechanical farming and strived to improve production efficiency. Therefore, last year's average yield per hectare reached a record high of 1.1 metric tons. The total world wheat production last year (excluding Soviet Russia) reached 192 million metric tons, about 90 million metric tons more than the previous year's 104 million metric tons. The most significant increase in production was in countries that have traditionally lacked wheat production, while the increase in countries that originally had surplus production was not surprising, as shown in the following table:

(Note) Unit: million hectares; metric tons produced per hectare; million metric tons

In terms of geographical areas, except for reductions in wheat field area in Australia and Africa compared to the previous year, the other areas largely increased, even in the Asian continent amidst the flames of war. Last year, the wheat field area in Asia increased from 20 million hectares in the previous year to 21 million hectares, and production increased from 17.2 million metric tons in the previous year to 18.7 million metric tons. However, the yield rate only increased from 0.826 metric tons per hectare to 0.89 metric tons. In comparison, North America increased from 0.79 metric tons to 0.89 metric tons, and South America increased from 0.85 metric tons to 1.03 metric tons. (To be continued)

Correction: In the foreign exchange arbitrage table in this publication, the August 20th, August price should be 17.125, the October 21st, October price should be 15.75, and the November 21st, December price should be 15.953125. This correction is attached.

### Finance: No Trading in Cash; Pure Gold Resumes Downward Trend

The cash market started with a weak disk situation. Yesterday, all transactions were similar to the prior holiday, with no trading at all. However, selling prices were still similar to the prior day.

Gold jewelry prices per tael were unchanged. Da Tonghang Lao Qingyun Shop still maintained the original price of 203 yuan, and Xin Niao Shop suspended it at 201 yuan, taking in at 195 yuan. London reported on the 14th that English pure gold had retreated by a half-penny per ounce due to the strengthening of the pound, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 9 and a half pence.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Both Rise

London reported on the 14th that the silver market was still flat. Fabricators and speculators bought in, but there was a lack of supply and limited transactions. Near-term silver rebounded by 25, and far-term also rebounded by 1875. Also, New York reported that the spot price of American silver still had a market but no goods. Furthermore, Bombay reported that the Indian silver market was strong, with the spot price continuing to rise by 6 annas, the near-term price also rising by 5 annas, and the far-term price rising by 3 annas.

### Grains: Strong Demand for Sheep Horn (rice variety)

Yesterday, the source of domestic rice was still limited, with only 7 ships arriving in the river and 4,000 to 5,000 bags transported by vehicles. Sales in this street market were particularly sluggish. However, it seemed that hoarders still had plans, but with the arrival of goods being scarce, sellers were even more determined. The market continued to be in short supply, with the price of thick japonica rice continuing to be several cents to one dime better, and the price of thin indica rice increasing by five or six cents. Zhongguan rice increased by two or three cents. Uniquely, the path for Sheep Horn rice was particularly strong, but there was a lack of supply. Sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, immediately increasing by one or two dimes. Du Bu Sheep Horn rice only improved by a few cents. The sales of hot-selling goods with a variable profit margin remained healthy, continuing to be quoted at one foot. Yin Yuan rice was reportedly out of stock and had no market.

### Sugar Market: New Diaoqing Combined Price Gradually Approaching; Expected to be Shipped to Shanghai Soon

Yesterday, the domestic sugar market continued to be strong, with Chaoqing sugar continuing to see upward momentum. For example, Kuntiqing rose to 12.8 yuan, Gao Huangtao rose to 12.16 yuan, and Jiandai Kai Chuan Shang Diaoqing rose to 11.7 yuan, a two dime increase. Miscellaneous Road white sugar was at 21.9 yuan, and Dagong flour was at 22.2 yuan. According to the origin's report, the price of new Diaoqing sugar was looser than before. Combining with Shanghai's market has gradually approached the norm, but the Oujiang market is better. Therefore, the goods shipped to Shanghai may be scarcer. It is expected that they will definitely arrive in Shanghai within this week. The Guild's quotation for spot goods was 24.5 yuan for crude white sugar, and 16.4 yuan for re-exported goods. Taikoo Che Bai B Mark Dongzhan goods were still at 22.75 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Hong Kong Traders Purchase Hawthorn Slices

Hawthorn slices have recently been frequently purchased by Hong Kong traders, with a very active market. Due to the scarcity of arriving goods, the inventory here is decreasing daily. The current market price is 16 yuan per picul, an exceptionally strong showing.

### Persimmon Cake Production Price Loosens

According to a letter from Qingdao, the current processing price of persimmon cakes is looser than before. For example, the price of Juzhuang Qing cakes is less than 7 yuan, and the price of boxed cakes is from 7.5 yuan to 8 yuan, with a stable trend.

### Medicinal Materials: Flying Unicorn Starch Arrives in a Rush; 5,000 Bags of Miscellaneous Varieties Yesterday

The number of new goods of Flying Unicorn brand starch entering the market this winter has increased sharply. Recently, a large batch has been shipped from the Netherlands. Yesterday, a certain shop opened 5,000 bags, priced at 15.6 yuan, more than 1 yuan less than before. However, other brands of goods stored here have inevitably been affected. For example, Renqiang brand starch has already fallen to a selling price of 17 yuan.

### Coal: Kailan Anthracite and Wheel Coal Have Both Been Shipped

Since the source of Kailan anthracite has been dredged, it has been shipped to various routes by wheel. Fellow traders and customers also have demand. Yesterday, a certain ship loaded over 3,000 tons of unified goods, which were sold by a certain shop. Fellow traders split the price, with the warehouse handling its own sales. The unified coal was priced at 36 yuan per ton, screened coal at 38 yuan, and lumps at 29.5 yuan. Shipping to other locations would require additional cartage fees. It was heard that trading was quite lively.

Explanation: ... The total of the above debts is 192,700,000 yuan. The regulations for the Guangxi Financial Public Debt have not been published, and details are unknown.

The total of the above various bonds is 3,000,090,400 yuan.

Free Talk

### "Yes"

—

"Yes" has always been the spirit of Chinese officialdom. When a superior speaks to a subordinate, regardless of whether it is right or wrong, the subordinate always replies with, "Yes." This spirit was most fully displayed during the late Qing Dynasty. As long as the person sitting above you opened his mouth, you would quickly put the word "Yes" in your mouth. If he ordered you to do something, of course you would say "Yes." If he told you to become a thief, you would also say "Yes." Even if he cursed you as a son of a dog, you would still have to say "Yes." If you didn't, then you didn't understand "etiquette" and were the most worthless person.

It is a pity that we do not have a writer like Guo Moruo. That kind of phenomenon has never been vividly depicted. - In fact, it is not just literary material. Within it, that is to say, within the countless "Yes"s, our past domestic and foreign history are actually buried at the same time.

As long as we have the opportunity to browse through past cases, no matter what the prison is, most of the prisoners' confessions recorded in the trials are repeating the words of the judge, and finally adding two words: "Yes, it is true." But most of that is also "extorted" through torture, but in short, it always wants you to say a "Yes." People who have been cultivated and raised in such a manner will deal with foreign affairs, and their style will naturally be like Chamberlain. The former Zongli Yamen [Foreign Affairs Office] was the place to say "Yes" to foreign dignitaries. As soon as a foreign dignitary entered, making an angry roar, the group of diplomatic officials would say "Yes," "Yes," "Yes." As a result, - needless to say. "Weak countries have no diplomacy," weak countries only have "Yes."

This is only talking about the late Qing Dynasty. After the Republic of China was established, "Yes" should have been "revolutionized" away. However, that is not the case. I am not very clear about what is going on in the officialdom. It is said that verbally, there is indeed no such sycophancy anymore. But in terms of diplomacy, starting from the "Twenty-One Demands," a string of events are still saying "Yes" to foreign countries. In terms of domestic affairs, starting from the "March 18th Incident," a string of events still want the people to say a "Yes." The guns of the soldiers cannot be taken down when they see foreign troops, which means our discipline is "Yes." The guns in the hands of the police will be fired when they see petitioning students, which means your discipline is "Yes." In short, the "Yes" said with the mouth has been reduced, or even shouted less, but in reality, the spirit of "Yes" is still being directly and indirectly expressed.

Naturally, there is also a "rebound." The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was unwilling to say "Yes." The Boxers were also unwilling to say "Yes." This is still talking about the late Qing Dynasty. But we can have the Republic of China, in fact, because we were unwilling to say "Yes" to the past. The "May Fourth" and "May Thirtieth" movements were also movements that were unwilling to say "Yes."

Only by resolutely refusing to say "Yes" can we stand tall. However, in the current War of Resistance, which is unwilling to say "Yes," there are actually people who are "Yes" again. That is Mr. Wang Jingwei's licentious statement: "Amity," "Yes." "Anti-communism," "Yes." "Economic cooperation," "Yes." -- "Yes," "Yes," "Yes," we seem to have gone to the former foreign affairs officials of the late Qing Dynasty again.

Is that really the case? I think history should not go backwards.

### Night Walker

Two or three individual shadows turned down the hillside.

The night was quiet. After the war, even the dogs were all dead. The night walkers were not disturbed, jumping over the ice-covered river. The water in the river was covered with a thin layer of ice. Occasionally, a brother stepped on it, making a cracking sound, and the ice shattered into several pieces. "Tsk!" Someone laughed, but was immediately silenced by the captain's stern warning.

"We are on a surprise attack, no talking is allowed!"

The earth was shrouded in darkness. A fierce wind swept through the forest, the bare branches rustling like ghosts. A gust of cold air blew on everyone's noses, freezing them, turning them red.

Cold?

The light of revenge shone brightly in their eyes. With fiery hearts and bodies, the night walkers were warm and happy.

"We're approaching the railway, everyone be careful!"

A section of sentry post was left three miles behind.

"Wu Zixu passed the checkpoint, one checkpoint after another."

Singing the uncouth Peking opera, Yu Zhengde hummed softly.

The night walkers lay down on the ground. A long line of men, what a sight!

Wang Lao San scratched his head and looked around, appearing dissatisfied:

"Surround and attack! I say, attacking the mountain gully won't work! It's a dead end!"

"You're afraid of death!"

Someone mocked him.

"Only dogs are afraid of death! Death! We have to do it right! I'm not clear about the head that cut with a knife. There are soldiers on the railway, damn it, Wangjia Bridge too, front and back, if we fire our guns, we'll be caught in the middle, like catching fish in muddy water, if we go up from north and south, how can we run! You tell me... you tell me, how can we run?"

This star of wisdom should have been employed earlier. The skinny captain shook his head:

"I have my own plan."

He smiled mysteriously.

"A plan! Let's see what trick he's going to play!" The night walkers watched intently.

After a while, long-legged Lao Li came running, with long ears sticking up.

"South of Wangjia Bridge, there's a small bank leading to the Yu River. I've already checked it out."

Clever, the captain had an idea. He instructed his brothers:

"Today's night raid is different from usual. Fire a few shots, then run. Follow me. Don't fire too many shots, and don't kill any passing soldiers. This is an order!"

"Haha, if we're going to do it, let's do it right! If you're not going to fight to the death, you might as well sleep well."

"Fire a few shots and run? What? Do you think we have wings, or that we're cowards!"

Insult and belittlement hurt everyone's heart. The night walkers climbed the hillside, silently filled with frustration.

Bang bang bang... bang... bang bang...

A blaze of fire lit up. The faces of the night walkers were covered in firelight. One flower, a beautiful flower... the fire of revenge! Auspicious red flowers!

Counting the fires, a long line of men. Beside the tunnel, on the small hill, in front of the river, at the bottom of the valley... the night walkers controlled the land. Night, blood was boiling, fire was raging, smoke was spreading, people and war were intertwined, life and death were competing.

A mile away, the gunfire from the north and south echoed intermittently. The earth was buried in darkness.

The captain's order was passed to every night walker. The night walkers stopped firing and began to retreat.

After a while, the gunfire started up again, moving more than a mile south of Wangjia Bridge.

Suddenly, like a gust of wind, no trace of disturbance. They reached a conclusion, the night walkers. "The gunfire is retreating north, approaching the great tunnel." The soldiers defending Wangjia Bridge thought.

"The gunfire is retreating north."

Chase! Chase! Chase!

A team of soldiers fired their guns in pursuit. They chased north.

Not a sound, the earth was quiet.

Buried in the darkness: a blaze of fire, a cluster of shadows, the rustling of a string of leather shoes.

One mile south of Wangjia Bridge: leaving a disturbance behind. The stationed army advanced south in response to the gunfire.

The soldiers guarding the road chased and pursued, their guns pointing north.

After a brief pause, another disturbance broke out.

Bang bang bang...

"Advance, advance! The enemy is not far away!"

The stationed army started up their machine guns.

"Fire intensely! Shoot forward!"

The soldiers guarding the road didn't have machine guns, and desperately fired their rifles.

Hiss... hiss... hiss hiss... hiss... broken...

Buried in the darkness: the night's farce! A children's game of slaughter! The carnage of flesh and blood, of friends and family!

Dawn broke. Who were the enemies?

Let's seal this secret! Shame, remorse, sorrow, who will bear this responsibility?

"Thirty-five enemies were killed: twenty-one soldiers guarding the road, and fourteen stationed soldiers."

But the real enemies had gone far away. They bypassed Hunan, took a small bank, and crossed the Yu River. This group of night walkers had completed their task.

### The Story of a Bird

— A Private

Contemplation is my favorite thing. When I have free time, I always open the window, face the sky, and let my mind reflect on memories, as light as a dream, as sweet as candy.

I remember when my uncle was alive, he was an expert at raising birds. The hall of our house was filled with birdcages of all colors. Inside were all kinds of birds, red, white, even strange and rare colors, chirping and chirping all day long. My uncle's daily routine was feeding them, letting them out, and cleaning the cages. As a playful child, I found this work quite interesting, so gradually I developed a fondness for birds.

One day, I was feeding parrots in the garden when suddenly a little sparrow was stealing the parrots' food. Caught off guard, the sparrow was caught by me. At that time, I was overjoyed and rushed to show it to my uncle. But he only said one sentence.

"Sparrows can't be raised, it will die tomorrow."

I couldn't understand the mystery of his words: he himself raised many birds, wouldn't they die too, why did he specifically curse the little sparrow that I had caught with great effort!

I secretly put the sparrow in a room, hung it on the kitchen beam, without letting my uncle know.

The next morning, I had high hopes, expecting to hear some chirping. As a result, in a pile of blood, the little animal lay prostrate, lifeless, ending its little life coldly. I cried in surprise, I couldn't bear to look at the terrifying scene. But I still couldn't understand the profound truth: "Sparrows cannot be raised."

When I reached adolescence, I saw millions of people fighting against demons for their own freedom, and I realized the great slogan of "Give me liberty, or give me death." The story of the sparrow in my childhood was a good example of it.

Now, I see the brave soldiers thousands of miles away, fighting for the liberation of the motherland, unleashing the fire of justice against the enemy, I am ashamed, I sympathize, I am ashamed because I understand the meaning of freedom even more.

Who still wants to be a bird in a cage, living a wretched life?

As the saying goes, "Though the sparrow be small, it has all its entrails." I can say, "Though the sparrow be small, it is full of spirit!"

### "Inspiring People's Aspirations"

— Fei Bai

The main purpose of our writing is to express the truths we have realized, to influence the readers. To influence the readers with positive truths, this is "inspiring people's aspirations." Now we should emphasize this meaning even more, so that we can exert the combat effectiveness of the pen and manifest the weapon nature of literature and art.

Based on this understanding, we must use real-life events as writing materials, and expand our vision from the self to look forward to the broad overall situation. Reality is multifaceted and ever-changing, with many writable materials, as long as we broaden our horizons, we will never feel a lack of materials.

The phenomenon of "all the same" and the so-called "eight-legged essay of resistance against Japan" is due to the author's lack of deep understanding of life, floating on the surface, and not reaching the core. The right way is to observe reality more, study reality more, and live seriously. We must not forget that literature and art are nothing more than a reflection of life, and its life is reality.

In order to achieve the goal of "inspiring people's aspirations", we must have a moving power. Empty clamor, even if shouting with all our might, is rarely useful. Only by being realistic, by bringing reality vividly to paper, can we give people a deep and lasting impression. Therefore, we are also against slogan-style works. We are not rigidly narrating, but vividly depicting, and need the artistic processing of literature and art, that is, to be figurative. As a writer said: "A person's character is not only reflected in what he does, but also in how he does it. To express the typical character in a typical environment", then, it can be like the morning bell and the evening drum, awakening people.

We must know that if we do not fight, we will be humiliated, there is no third way. If we do not write works that "inspire people's aspirations", it will inevitably produce a negative and bad effect, making people ignore the bitter reality. This is definitely not what every conscientious writer wants to do. Therefore, I sincerely hope that every writer can actively shoulder the task of combat, and sharpen that pen like a dagger, a bayonet, to clearly distinguish between light and darkness, integrity and shamelessness. The frivolous singing should be stopped. We must shout out the voice of the times, and be a singer of the nation.

### Roar, Yangtze River!

— Jun Ping

Roar, Yangtze River!

You are the heart of new China,

You are the splendor of Eastern civilization.

You surge up滔滔，turning into towering waves!

In the February sun,

Shining on the banks of the Yangtze River,

We, this group of guerrilla partners,

Are all coming and going here,

Coming and going.

Today we are all singing

For the victory of the Wu people's resistance against Japan,

Our songs do not contain

Boredom, drama, or absurdity.

Roar, Yangtze River!

Emit your majestic roar,

Resonating like thunder far and wide,

And sing with us!

### The Mingxing Film Studio Occupied by the Japanese Army Was Not Completely Destroyed; Only One Western-Style Building Was Reduced to Ashes

The Mingxing Company's Fenglin Bridge factory, located in the occupied area, has long been occupied by the Japanese army as a military camp. It was previously rumored that they intended to use the film studio to produce "pro-Japanese films," but they have been unable to do so to this day due to their inability to win over the staff. The premises suddenly caught fire last day at 1:15 PM. The flames soared into the sky, and the fire was fierce. It was not until 2:30 PM that it was extinguished. Yesterday's reports all stated that the film studio had been reduced to ashes. An investigation has revealed that the main film studio and two other small Western-style buildings are still standing as before. Only one large Western-style building and a film production room were destroyed. The rest are unharmed. — This can be seen from a distance from the Xu Jia Hui riverbank. It is said that the Mingxing company purchased the factory site in the spring of the 22nd year for 160,000 yuan and moved it from its original location on Du Mei Road. Later, it mortgaged the property to a major bank for 100,000 yuan. The land covers an area of more than 20 mu and originally had three large and small Western-style buildings. The largest one was originally the office of the branch of the staff — the one that was burned down today. The other two are resided in by the GM Zhang Shichuan and the family of the late director Zheng Zhengqiu respectively. The houses and the film studio are not connected, so they were not affected. However, leaving them in the occupied area to be exploited is not something for Mingxing to celebrate.

### Mei Lanfang's First Performance of Daiyu Burying Flowers

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

When Mei Lanfang came to Shanghai in the fifth year of the Republic of China, he used his new costume drama "Daiyu Burying Flowers" as a calling card. Every performance was packed, and the word-of-mouth was even better than "Chang'e Flying to the Moon." Shan Yin Kan Daoren, a supporter of Mei, praised Wan Hua's performance of "Burying Flowers" to the fullest, hailing it as an immortal work. On the day of Wan Hua's performance of "Burying Flowers," Dao Ren specially compiled and printed a special edition, called "Mei Lanfang's Daiyu Burying Flowers Libretto," printing 10,000 copies and openly distributing them in the theater. This was the beginning of the trend of song circles printing and sending special editions. The libretto was well-written, using Lian Shi paper, small regular script, and stone printing, the size being similar to the "Drama Monthly" currently published by the Beijing Opera School. The essay "Burial Flower Play Exam" written by the group Kan is recorded and published below: to show the structure of Wan Hua's play and the procedure of the entire play; and to make it a reference for scholars to learn from and to help them to make mistakes.

"Mei Lanfang's play is very well-arranged, the lyrics are all based on "Dream of the Red Chamber," without any fabrication, with Daiyu singing the most. The singing is divided into five sections: 1. Daiyu's appearance introduction; 2. Sweeping flowers sings Xipi slow beat; 3. Burying flowers sings Er Liu beat: 4. The return journey sings Shaking Board; 5. Yan Song Jng Fang Xin sings the opposite Erhuang; all are extremely exquisite in singing and stage appearance. The Miaoci Tong Xiyu fold, which uses pure acting and lines, conveys emotions without leaving any experience, which cannot be described in words.

The whole play has only five people, divided into four scenes: the first scene opens, with a clown-like waiter Shang Mingwen, telling the story of Bao Yu's pampered and preciousness, and the original end of buying books, turning to the next. The second scene is Jia Bao Yu, always played by Jiang Miaoxiang, dressed as a young master, wearing a Zijing crown, wearing a light rosy colored dress with a cape, wearing a gold lock necklace, and wearing Bao Yu, wearing socks and shoes, and he is also a Yihong son. After reading the introduction, he made a lonely and difficult appearance, Mingyan presented the book, Bao Yu read the book Jie, and after reading it, he took the book. The third scene is Daiyu's appearance, Mei Lan sings, dressed in costume, but when he appears, his coat is dark blue, and when he comes out, the audience is in a trance, suspiciously thinking that a fairy has come to fly, hitting Jingduhuo, after reading the first section of Zong Bai, he calls the maid Zujuan, Zujuan is played by Yao Yufu, and she can also imitate it, no wonder those who love Wan Hua also love Yufu. Zujuan takes the hoe up, takes off Daiyu's coat, rolls up the curtain and goes down, Daiyu then does the act of watching the swallows sweeping flowers and burying flowers, this act is very long, from Daiyu to read the introduction and sing Xipi slow beat and Er Liu beat two sections and then down. In the fourth scene, Xiren comes on, enters the garden to look for Bao Yu, Xiren is played by Zhu Ruxiang, who is still flawless, and once played by Chen Tongyun, then the measures are not similar. Xixia Zujuan Shang, holding clothing into the garden to find Daiyi a turn down. The fifth scene is the Miaoci Tong Xiyu, and the Yan Song Jing Fang Xin fold. Bao Yu first comes on to watch the book, falling flowers, and teasing each act, Miaoxiang can also understand. The first half of this scene is purely dialogue and acting, after Xiren asks Bao Yu to leave, Zujuan adds a coat to Daiyu, carries the hoe and goes down, the song during the return journey Jing Fang Xin reverses the tune, it is sad and gentle, and does not lose Qing's identity, Zujuan Shang helps Gui to sing the epilogue again, and feels even more sad, so the audience all stay ear, three days endless, and the inner curtain sings Peony Pavilion Kunqu Opera and reverses the tune, the erhu is unprecedented, so this play is known as a masterpiece Yun.

Movie Star Old Records

Diao Banhua — Wu Mingxiang Diao Banhua is from the shores of West Lake, from the same hometown as Yuan Meiyun. Her original name was "Wu Mingxiang." It is said that she entered the film industry because she resembled Hu Die, but it is also true that she has a special and ardent love for film. She first joined Lianhua Film Company, and the three characters "Diao Banhua" were inscribed for her by playwright Sun Shiyi. It is said that when Sun Shiyi first saw Diao Banhua, Diao Banhua was wearing a coat of sable fur, looking like a spotted sable, so he reversed the three characters "spotted sable" and changed them to Diao Banhua. Her debut work at Lianhua was "Qiu Shan Ming Deng." Later, she joined Xinhua Company for a time, and appeared in "Yichang Night Rain" and "Diao Chan" successively. Now, she has been hired by Yihua Company and will star in the costume film "Daji".

Tong Yue Tong Yuejuan's original surname Early years, she studied with a female actor/male actor (Nujiao Tian) Tong Yuejuan. Tong Xinhua Xinhua, two Zhang Shankun's夭 A long time ago, Tong Juan——Wan Xiuying Wan, named Xiuying, Tong Junqing (stage name play, and only then did he change his name to Junqing. Zhang Yinglin, an employee of today's film company, once appeared in Director Wu Yonggang's "Li Hentian" film. In addition, she is also the director of the "Xinhua Song and Dance Troupe".

Bai Yang — Yang Junli Bai Yang's original surname was Yang, and she was called Yang Junli when she was in Beiping. She only changed her name to Bai Yang after engaging in drama activities, and once cohabited with playwright Ma Yanxiang. When the Mingxing Film Company established the No. 2 factory, Bai Yang joined the Mingxing front line with Hong Shen's recommendation. "Crossroads" established her silver base, but from that time on, her cohabitation relationship with Ma Yanxiang also came to an end. After the war, Bai Yang went west to Sichuan, and now she has become the mainstay female actress of the Central Film Studio in Chongqing. It is said that she and Gao Zhanfei are already in love in Chongqing.

In addition, Chen Yanyan's original name was "Qianqian", Bai Hong's original name was "Lizhu", Xu Lai, who used to be famous on the screen, was originally named "Jiehuang", Gao Qianpin's original name was "Xuwei", and Li Zhuozhuo's original name was Xingqiu, which are known by very few people.

### Tan Ying Suffers From a Boil on Her Nose; Her Condition Is Gradually Improving After Days of Treatment, But She Is Still Very Worried About It

— Silver Thread

Since Tan Ying left Shanghai with Cheng Bugao, because she missed the soldier and mourned her deceased son — the four-year-old child, who died last year — she was often depressed and silent, and her expression was extremely negative. She drowned her sorrows in alcohol, and under the influence of alcohol, she even burst into tears and often cried to her heart's content. Recently, a very severe boil suddenly appeared on the right side of her nose, causing her constant pain and discomfort. At first, she asked a Dr. Chen to apply medicine for treatment, but it was ineffective. These days, another Dr. Tao has been treating her for days, and her condition has only improved slightly. Recently, she has not been able to film, and if this continues, she will lose her job. But she is still very worried, fearing that if a scar appears on her face in the future, it will hinder her filming career, which is not a small matter!

Yuan Meiyun is now Mrs. Wang Yin. She has a small scar on her cheek, which adds to the beauty of the lines on her face. She went from the stage to Tianyi, which was a stage; from Tianyi to Yihua, it was another stage; now it has become another stage. Her marriage with Wang Yin was due to their co-starring in the film "Green Sky." She grew up in the city and has little experience of the world. She is always surprised and makes a fuss about everything. The first time she went to the countryside to shoot on location, she encountered a water buffalo, and she was so frightened that she jumped up and said, "What is this thing? So big!"

Liu Jiqun, the "Oriental Hartai", can be said to be able to perform all kinds of people from all walks of life in movies. He wears sunglasses all year round, a tilted felt hat, and his style is neither fish nor fowl. He appeared on Nanjing Road these days, squeezing through the crowd: the heels of his black leather shoes were crooked, and he smelled strongly of sourness.

Ye Qiuxin has the reputation of being a model beauty, bestowed by the propaganda staff of Tianyi Company. She is a northerner, good at Mandarin and English, and often accompanies foreign friends, going in and out of the Jai Alai arena, and she herself dresses up like a foreign beauty.

The short and burly Zheng Xiaoqiu grew up in the film industry. In the early years, he was probably the male lead in all the films. Because he was short and could not compare with Hu Die in height, he specially made a pair of high-heeled shoes to make up for it. As a result, he had to suffer for three days after shooting a few shots, which can be said to be a sacrifice for art.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (7) (6)

— Xu Muyun

And said: "This marshal's seal is such an important thing, Qin Xiang and Yuchi Gong, two grandfathers, have been competing for it, how can you just throw it on the ground? For example, if I were to bestow upon you a treasure, wouldn't you bring it home properly, instead of throwing it halfway? This will punish you for disrespect, kneeling in the courtyard." At the same time, he reprimanded Wei Bubao (nicknamed Wei Jian): How come you don't teach them these rules when you manage the Nanfu? The Neiwu Mansion is fined half a year's salary, and you must be careful in everything in the future." The next day, Wei Bubao went to the backstage to see this Fourth Master, hurried to him and kowtowed, saying, "I thank you for your grace, I have been working for nothing this half a year, please, old man, don't lose your temper in the future, okay?" Ever since Wang Si was punished this time, he had been careful in everything, and dared not be willful in the palace.

As the saying goes, mountains are hard to change, and nature is hard to move. Although he had changed his temper in the palace, when he sang opera outside, he still lost his temper from time to time, and was almost beaten several times. Fortunately, his apprentice-nephew Rui Debao helped him out and reminded him with words, so he was fine. Wang Si was originally a disciple of the Quanfu class, and Rui Debao's master Li Lianzhongchu was a disciple of the Shengchunkuike class. Because these two classes were both taught by Zhang Sanyong, the grandfather of the famous martial artist Zhang Changbao (Xiao Lou Shuyan's teacher), Wang Rui and the two were also considered to be uncles and nephews. In a certain year, Gao Xueqiao's Shangren organized a certain class, and invited Wang Rui and the two to join the performance through the introduction of the old Sheng Meng Xiaoru. At that time, Lao Rui was in his prime, and he always sang the big axis opera when he took the class outside. Wang Si was willing to play the role of a martial arts veteran with him in order to support this apprentice-nephew. On this day, the two of them came to the backstage, and the stage was performing "Luoma Lake". The one who went to Huang Tianba was the young boss Gao Mou. Of course, young people were too hot when singing opera. Wang Si lifted the battle curtain and glanced at it, then hummed his nose and turned his mouth, and said sarcastically: "Is this singing "Luoma Lake"? As soon as he finished saying this sentence, before he could say the second sentence, he saw that the old and young of the Gao family were all glaring at him, staring at him with their eyes. Rui Debao saw that the expression was not right, and hurriedly gave him a low ear (insiders call whispering a bite on the ear) and said, "Fourth Uncle, there are people who beat people in this backstage, please say less jerky words." After hearing this, he closed his bad mouth and didn't say any more.

### Relief for Street Refugees

— Qin

On the evening of January 8th, on Guangdong Road (from Sichuan Road to the Shipping Club), I saw many refugees sleeping on the stone steps by the roadside, a total of twelve people.

These twelve refugees were scattered across five sections of the stone steps:

In one spot, there was a sick person, wearing only two thin layers of clothing and covered with a straw mat. The cold wind was constantly howling. This sick refugee was crying in pain from the cold.

In another spot, there was an old woman, an old man, and a young man, sitting silently on a straw mat. After asking, I learned that the young man was the old woman's neighbor, and the old man was her uncle. The old woman's husband had died of dysentery on the same stone steps where the sick man was lying, two weeks prior.

In another spot, there was a couple and a dockworker. They only had one straw mat and one thin blanket on the stone steps where they were sleeping.

In another spot, there was a middle-aged man. He had neither tattered clothes nor a straw mat on the stone steps where he was sleeping, so he could only sit there alone, head hunched and arms crossed. It is said that he spends every night like this.

In another spot, there were four children around fourteen or fifteen years old, sleeping on a straw mat and covered with a cotton wadding.

The cold wind blew harder and harder, and the twelve street refugees were all shivering from the cold. The next morning, I personally took them to the Cilian Association's shelter with the director. The sick person was also taken to the hospital.

The number of refugees sleeping on the streets is not limited to these few; there are at least thousands of street refugees in the entire city! How will these thousands of people survive this cold winter? It is indeed a serious problem. Once the ground is covered with ice and snow, there is a risk of them all freezing to death. According to news from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, in November, an average of one hundred and ten bodies were collected and buried by the roadside every day. Anyone who sees this number must be shocked!

Shanghai is truly a prosperous place. It is said that Shanghai people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every night on dance halls, gambling halls, theaters, and tea houses and bars. If they could save just one percent of this expense each day, they could save the lives of thousands of street refugees.

Relieving street refugees is the responsibility of all Shanghai people. How to provide relief? I will propose two methods below:

Establish cold shelters: Any street refugee who can support themselves but has no place to live can stay in a cold shelter. The cold shelter is only for lodging and does not provide meals.

Establish reception centers: Any street refugees who cannot support themselves and have no place to live can stay in a reception center. In addition to providing food and lodging, reception centers urgently need to provide public education.

As for funding, as long as Shanghai people are enthusiastic about supporting it, there shouldn't be too much difficulty.

"The heart of compassion is inherent in all people." Fellow countrymen of Shanghai! Please get up quickly! Save the street refugees! Biography of Famous People

### The Hero of Dongguan "Yuan Chonghuan" (1)

— Lan Xin

These days, the war in Guangdong is at a difficult and inextricable point. It is said that on the east coast, the Chinese army once entered "Dongguan"—"Dongguan is a strategically important location, a must-have place for strategists." Thus, "Dongguan," under the threat of firepower, has become a front in the national war. Reading the newspaper reminds one of a famous national hero from Dongguan.

It is said that at the end of the Ming Dynasty, there was a Yuan Chonghuan in Dongguan, Guangdong. This gentleman was very intelligent because he diligently studied every day. He passed the imperial examination.

The knowledge he studied at the time was: How to serve the people? How to maintain the integrity of the country's territory? He did this because the Manchus were causing chaos at the time, the Ming Emperor was suffering from it, and the people were even more miserable! Studying is for saving the country and the people and serving humanity, not for getting promoted and making a fortune. He understood this principle from that time.

One day, he was sitting in his study, studying current affairs, feeling deeply about the rampant Manchus. It was the weather of the third month of spring. A pear tree and a few sparse wisteria vines cast a very quiet reflection on the window. He couldn't help but sigh, "How can others be allowed to snore beside my bed?" After saying this, he picked up his sword and began to dance.

From then on, he studied military strategy, and many wise, loyal, and brave heroes in history became his only good teachers and friends.

Not long after, the Manchus and the Ming Dynasty officially went to war. The Ming soldiers were defeated in battle, and Emperor Huaizong was very frightened. He summoned his ministers to discuss a solution. Someone suggested that a good general should be carefully selected to guard Shanhaiguan. The majority agreed with this idea.

This suggestion suited Yuan Chonghuan's taste. Thus, what he had learned was now an opportunity to put into practice. In order to understand the situation at Shanhaiguan, he secretly rode a horse alone. At night, the bright moon hung in the sky.

He went to Shanhaiguan alone to scout. Later, he reported to Emperor Huaizong, explaining the situation at Shanhaiguan and the strategy for defending it in detail. Unexpectedly, once he started talking, Emperor Huaizong was very amazed and greatly admired Chonghuan's talent. Emperor Huaizong said, "You are truly a loyal and brave good subject. It would be excellent for you to guard Shanhaiguan."

At that time, more than 100,000 refugees in "Thirteen Mountains" were surrounded by the Manchus and could not escape. Chonghuan requested the court to dispatch 5,000 elite soldiers to garrison "Ningyuan" because "Ningyuan" was close to "Thirteen Mountains," and stationing troops there could strengthen the position of "Thirteen Mountains." In addition, he advocated dispatching another 5,000 brave soldiers to rescue the 100,000 surrounded people. Unfortunately, his suggestion was blocked by a short-sighted minister named Wang Zaixin and was not implemented. As a result, only 6,000 people from "Thirteen Mountains" escaped the tiger's mouth, and tens of thousands of lives were lost to the Manchu swords and spears. What a pity!

Chonghuan garrisoned Shanhaiguan, improving military preparations externally and comforting the military and civilians internally. He achieved great results. Later, he was sent to garrison "Ningyuan." Originally, Zu Dashou was stationed there, and the court had told him to build a city for defense, but he had always taken it lightly. He said, "What's the point of building a city? Sooner or later, it will fall into the hands of others!" He was perfunctory every day and refused to take it seriously. When Chonghuan arrived there, he hired civilians and started construction on a large scale. In less than a year, he built a magnificent city. The desolate Ningyuan became an important town outside the pass. On the day the city walls were completed, Chonghuan swore to the sky: "I, Chonghuan, will live and die with this city."

Not long after, Chonghuan led his generals and divided their forces to occupy Jinzhou, Qingshan, Songshan... and other places, opening up thousands of miles of territory. His fame and reputation spread far and wide!

But unfortunately, things followed. Court ministers seized power and envied Chonghuan, falsely claiming that Jinzhou could not be defended and that the garrison should be withdrawn. This news turned Chonghuan's face green with anger. He said angrily, "In military strategy, there is only advance, not retreat. This is the land we won with our blood. If Jinzhou withdraws its troops, Ningyuan cannot be protected. If Ningyuan is not protected, Shanhaiguan is also in danger. Why do you want me to withdraw troops!" Later, he said, "I, Yuan, am the 'Ningqian Dao'. I will be an official there, and I will die there. I swear not to withdraw a single soldier." As a result, the court had no other way but to start from another aspect, throwing away hundreds of thousands of stones of grain, and also withdrawing the guards from Qingshan and Songshan, causing all the residents to feel uneasy and had to escape into the pass with the old and the young.

When the Qing soldiers heard this news, they thought the opportunity had come, so they immediately led a large army across the Liao River to attack Chonghuan.

Chonghuan then summoned his soldiers, gave them instructions, and swore that everyone should work together to defend Ningyuan to the death. He took a knife and cut off his own finger, using his blood to write a bright red character on white cloth—"Loyalty, Bravery, Love for the Country." The soldiers all cried out loud when they saw this. Everyone was willing to fight the Manchus to the death.

The Manchu soldiers besieged the city, and Chonghuan went out of the city to meet them in battle. Because military discipline was strict, everyone was determined to die. After one battle, the Manchu soldiers suffered heavy losses. At that time, Emperor Huaizong originally thought that Ningyuan could not be defended after hearing the ministers' reports, but he was very excited when he received this news. He immediately summoned Chonghuan to Beijing and rewarded him.

Not long after, hundreds of thousands of Manchu soldiers attacked Longjingguan and Da'ankou. Because the troops stationed in these places were incompetent and far inferior to Chonghuan, they avoided the strong and attacked the weak, and attacked there directly. As soon as the war started, the Manchu soldiers occupied many places without wasting a single arrow, and marched mightily to Zunhua. Emperor Huaizong immediately ordered Chonghuan to send troops. Chonghuan immediately sent Zhao Shuaijiao to rescue.

This General Zhao usually admired Chonghuan very much. He was deeply influenced by Chonghuan. Therefore, he deeply understood the great righteousness. He was ordered to set up camp at Santunying near Zunhua, and the Manchu soldiers swarmed to surround Santunying. At this time, he couldn't care about much. Relying on a heart of loyalty, bravery, and love for the country, he killed his way into the Manchu camp, but the Manchu soldiers came up together, more and more. Zhao Shuaijiao was exhausted from killing. He fully expected the local garrison in the rear camp to come out to support him, but the local garrison was afraid that the Manchu soldiers would kill into their own camp and refused to come out. Poor Zhao Shuaijiao's soldiers were all sacrificed, and finally he looked up to the sky and sighed, "My strength is exhausted!" Then he drew his sword and committed suicide. (To be continued)

### Weekly War Situation - Guangdong Area

The main force of the Japanese army in Guangdong, more than 20,000 men, is still concentrated in the suburbs of Guangzhou, and no active action has been found, but they have been busy building fortifications in the suburbs of Guangzhou for days, seemingly to defend Guangzhou. The highway from Huaxian to Taipingchang has been automatically destroyed by the Japanese army, which shows that the Japanese army is afraid of the Chinese army's southward advance. The Japanese army on the Guangzhou-Conghua highway was attacked by the Chinese army, and the thousand or so Japanese soldiers tried their best to counterattack and fought fiercely with the Chinese army, but later collapsed and retreated. The Japanese troops in Zengcheng and Shetouling were attacked by the Chinese army on another night. The Japanese army relied on fortifications to resist until midnight, and the Japanese army in Shetouling was surrounded. Another unit broke into the north gate of Zengcheng and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. The Japanese army then rushed from Shitan, Guangzhou, to support. The Chinese army retreated to its original position. In short, the Japanese army around Guangzhou is often attacked by the Chinese army from all directions, suffering heavy losses and being in a state of panic. As for Beihai and Weizhou Island, three Japanese warships, including an aircraft carrier, arrived a few days ago to cover the Japanese army's landing and disrupt the people. The residents are suffering greatly. The army seems to have the intention of attacking Jiangmen and Siyi. The Chinese army is on strict guard.

### Northern Hunan and Southern Hubei

The war in northern Hunan is very quiet. Since the Chinese army attacked Taolin and Fengjiacun, the Japanese army has been very busy mobilizing in the Taolin area and has densely laid barbed wire around the garrison. Local people have been brutally killed many times, and many have fled. A team of Japanese soldiers ambushed at Xinkaitang Xijiang Shanping a few days ago and suffered considerable losses. Now all the Japanese warships in Xijiang have retreated to Bailuoji, and only an empty city remains in Yueyang. Therefore, the Chinese guerrillas are advancing towards Yueyang. Southern Henan is also very quiet. Guerrillas encountered the Japanese army in the Xianning Chongyang area and were entangled.

### Northern Henan and Eastern Hubei

In northwestern Henan, there have only been minor contacts. In the Tianmen, Jingshan, and Zaoshi areas, most of the Japanese troops have withdrawn to the Yangjiachang area. The Chinese army is following and attacking, and has advanced to Chengling, not far from Hanchuan City, and is still advancing. In Suixian Luoyangdian, the Japanese army fought fiercely with the army. Near Zhe River, the Japanese army on the west bank of Jiangjiahe is active again, and artillery is firing at the Chinese army's positions across the board. Hundreds of infantrymen are also attacking the Chinese army fiercely. In the northeastern border of Hubei, Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery are divided into groups to attack the guerrilla forces in Yanjiahe north of Macheng. Under the stalemate, the Chinese army retreated to Yewan. The Japanese army on Dashu Mountain also strengthened its position and seemed to be attacking Luan.

### Southern Xun and Central Anhui

The Japanese troops between Yongxiu and De'an in northern Anhui have also had contacts in recent days. Baicha was once recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops north of Zhanggongdu have been constantly firing artillery and releasing poison gas. Many Chinese soldiers have been injured and poisoned, but the Chinese guerrillas once attacked the Japanese army on Highway 9 at night. The Japanese army responded in a panic, and the loss of military equipment and lives was also considerable. The Japanese troops in Wanzhi, southern Anhui, once occupied Honghuapu, but were soon repelled by the Chinese guerrillas. More than 300 Japanese troops attacked the Chinese army's side of Guolong Mountain, but were also repelled by the Chinese defenders. Therefore, in recent days, the situation has been quiet. The Japanese army in central and northern Anhui often mobilizes, and the intention is unknown.

### Southern Shanxi

The war situation in southern Shanxi is quite tense. The Japanese army, with 30,000 men, is taking a defensive position in the Yongji Jiexian Anyi area, mindful of the previous failure to attack Zhongtiao Mountain. Another part of the force is attacking Hejin in the north, and attacking Jinxi, Xiangning, Jixian, Daning, and Yonghe, attempting to attack and destroy the base of the Jin Sui Army, and then advance north to threaten, and then seize Yumen to realize its purpose of attacking Shaanxi. However, the Chinese army is attacking head-on, and the two sides are deadlocked. The Japanese army that entered Jixian divided into three routes to attack west, one towards Mafentan, one towards Longwang Mountain, and one towards Xiaochuanwo. The Chinese troops on both sides of the He River attacked from both sides, forcing the Japanese army to increase troops to resist stubbornly. The Japanese army on the Zhongli Highway was defeated in a counterattack by the Chinese army, and Jixian, Daning, Xiangning, and Puxian were successively recovered. There have been no battles in Suiyuan. The Japanese army is rushing to build an airport in Baotou, and the mobilization of troops seems to be quite busy. According to knowledgeable people, it is nothing more than secretly going and openly coming, creating a false impression.

### Inquiry About Missing Person

Yizhi Guo, four years old, with a local accent, with delicate features, wearing a dark brown cotton robe and a pointed velvet hat, suddenly went missing at the end of December last year near Jiangyuan Lane on Xinzha Road. Now his parents are extremely anxious. If people from all walks of life know his whereabouts or have taken him in, please notify Nanchang Rice Store at the west end of Parker Road on Xinzha Road. There will be a considerable reward.

Discussion of Premature Aging and the Art of Reversing Aging

Although using "old" to address someone can also be a sign of respect, it refers to their seniority or experience. If you say they are old in age, even someone with white hair and a beard will feel unhappy. This is because "old" is next to "death." People have a love of life, and heaven has a virtue of love, so who wants to die? That's why Xu Fu wanted to sail the sea in search, just to avoid death. But from old to death, this is the natural course of lifespan. However, many people are still young in age, but look decrepit. What is the reason for this? According to medical experience, the aging of the human body is greatly related to the gonads. If a person's gonadal fluid is abundant, the metabolism will inevitably be vigorous. The skin, muscles, bones, blood, and endocrine glands will have a large number of new cells. Therefore, even if they are in their fifties or sixties, their skin will not show wrinkles, their muscles will be rich and have a ruddy complexion, and they will still look very young. At the same time, their reproductive power will inevitably be strong. Even if they have a young wife, their love will be stronger, and their family will be harmonious, or they may even have children in old age. How happy and fortunate this is! Such a person will inevitably enjoy a long life, with grandchildren around their knees, enjoying the joys of family! Suppose, if a man commits self-abuse in his early years, followed by nocturnal emission, or is excessively indulgent after marriage, has multiple wives and indulges in lust, resulting in the depletion of gonadal fluid, and the metabolism also declines, then they will be sallow and thin, and wrinkles will appear before they are old. Their mental power will decline, often suffering from nervous headaches, unable to think, with weak memory, short sleep time, or even insomnia. Their kidneys will be deficient and incompetent, with back pain, and their body will be hunched over. Although they are still in middle age or prime of life, they already look like an old man about to die. This kind of pitiful living dead person not only suffers physically and mentally, but also has no hope for their academic and career prospects. Even in the marital sexual life that is indispensable in life, they often cannot get what they want and are hated by their wives! This often leads to family tragedies, or even lifelong regrets for not having children! In short, the tragic fate of those who age prematurely will be even worse than that of short-lived early deaths! But is there an art to reversing aging? Yes, there is. This has shone a different light in the 20th-century medical world. Initially, there were studies by Steinach, Voronoff, and Holmes, among others. Steinach's research was the most insightful and successful. After more than 30 years of hard experimentation, he learned that the gonadal fluid in the human body is greatly related to health and lifespan. Therefore, he extracted the gonadotropin from strong animals such as apes and gorillas and replenished it to the human body using blood transfusions, which proved to be very effective. However, the implementation of the surgery was extremely difficult and could not be universally offered to the public. Later, with the assistance of many famous doctors, the gonadotropin was refined into a preparation called "Steinach's Gonadotropin." After taking it, it could produce sperm, strengthen the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and activate blood within 24 hours, exerting great efficacy. Although it cannot be said that it can completely reverse aging and make people live forever, it is indeed the most targeted and effective treatment for premature aging and neurasthenia, such as the above-mentioned symptoms. Later, it was repeatedly tested and secretly adopted by famous European and American doctors such as Camking and Jamst, and it was determined to have definite efficacy. At that time, I happened to be studying in the United States and personally saw and participated in the experiments. After I completed my studies and returned to China, I introduced this drug to the Chinese people and repeatedly conducted clinical experiments to determine whether it was suitable for the physique of the Chinese people. I deeply felt that the drug was peaceful in nature and its effectiveness was definite and great. Over the years, I have cured no fewer than tens of thousands of patients. However, those who produce sperm must take "Hiimitus's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and prevent nocturnal emission, which will speed up the effect. However, patients who can personally come to our clinic in this city to receive electrotherapy, surgery, and other new methods can be guaranteed a faster recovery.

### Common Diseases of Young People

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereologist

From the Standard Handsome Man to

Youthful Self-Abuse and Nocturnal Emission

Love of beauty is human nature. Not only do women like to be beautiful, but we men also want to be handsome. However, women's love of beauty cannot escape cosmetics (except for women who pursue healthy beauty), and men's handsomeness requires a good figure in addition to clothing.

Speaking of a good figure, it is not easy. First, the height must be moderate, second, the skeleton must be well-proportioned and the muscles must be firm, third, the complexion must be rosy and the demeanor must be upright, and fourth, the eyes must be bright and clear. The vigor of the spirit, the liveliness of the demeanor, the agility of thought, and the serenity of the attitude need not be said. Even with the above four items, how many young people in today's society can pass?

We will not blow hot and cold and say how bad today's young people are, nor will we boast and praise how good today's young people are. We only know to silently observe from a factual point of view and feel that there are too few young people who are complete in spirit, energetic, and strong enough to be called standard handsome men. What we see are nothing more than young people suffering from youthful diseases.

What is a youthful disease? Most readers have already understood it without the author saying it. A youthful disease is of course a very bad disease! It is masturbation. From a health perspective, masturbation can truly be called "playing with things and losing one's ambition." Once a young person is infected, the most obvious symptom is nocturnal emission. Semen is the foundation of nourishing the body. If a large amount is allowed to be lost, the person will become sallow and thin, with back pain, a heavy head, and bitter thoughts. What makes the patient most embarrassed is that the development function is hindered, resulting in local shortness, testicular atrophy, and kidney impotence. With such a withered and weak young person, health is not even worth mentioning, let alone a standard of beauty?

Then, can this kind of young person not be saved? No, if the patient is determined, recognizes the goal, and on the one hand, quickly quits masturbation and engages in noble sports, and on the other hand, rubs the local area with cold water every night before going to bed and takes four "Hiimitus's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate, then nocturnal emission can be stopped that night. As for the various neurasthenia caused by masturbation and nocturnal emission, you can also take the gonadotropin preparation "Gonadotropin" at the same time to nourish and strengthen the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and benefit the marrow. In a short period of time, you will be able to restore the youth's inherent vigor, lay the foundation for all happiness, and at that time, even if you cannot join the ranks of standard beauty, you will definitely be able to be a "strong man" full of energy.

### Beauty, Women's Beauty, and the Breasts

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Good breast development can indeed enhance a woman's beautiful posture. The so-called feminine curves are undoubtedly formed by the towering breasts setting off the plump buttocks. Therefore, healthy breast development is almost a prerequisite for modern women. However, in this turbulent era, misfortune often befalls women. The most common phenomenon is physical weakness, such as irregular menstruation, menstrual bloating and pain, unpleasant leucorrhea, neurasthenia, etc. In this kind of woman, the ovarian function has been devastated, and the metabolism has also declined. Therefore, they are sallow and thin, and their breasts have also shrunk. Although they are still young, they have already become old and ugly. At this time, even if they are covered in makeup and use breast pads to pretend to be healthy and beautiful, those with discerning eyes will know at a glance that it will only increase their ugliness! Moreover, if this kind of disease is dragged on without treatment, it will become anemia and consumption, with a risk to life! In order to adapt to this practical need, medical scientists have worked hard to research and invent the ovarian preparation for women, "Gonadotropin." Once taken, it can enhance ovarian function and invigorate metabolism. It can not only cure various women's hidden diseases, but also promote breast development, whiten the skin, make the cheeks rosy, and enhance beauty. If you continue to take it, you can even reduce age, prolong life, and maintain youth forever. Isn't it a treasure for women!

### Records of Venereal Disease Treatment

— Compiled by Venereal Disease Specialist Physician Zhan Nianceng

(I) A Glimpse of Kidney Deficiency Recovery

Patient Shi ××, 31 years old, residing on Rue Massenet, working at ×× Bank. Mr. Shi was handsome in his youth and enjoyed a considerable reputation in Shanghai. With a wide circle of friends and constant social engagements, his health was depleted and his spirit fatigued, suffering severely from kidney deficiency. Although he had taken various Chinese and Western medications, none were effective. Experiencing both physical and mental anguish, he consulted various venereal disease specialists. Last autumn, he was introduced to me by his colleague Shen Tu Jianjun for treatment. (Note: Mr. Shen Tu also suffered from neurasthenia and underdevelopment, which I cured.) I advised him on proper nourishment and administered the latest painless German "Diemen's" electrotherapy, stimulating his central nervous system. Furthermore, recognizing that the root cause of his condition was a deficiency and imbalance of endocrine secretions in the gonads, I instructed him to purchase "Reproduction Element" from the Hua Mei Pharmacy for supplementation. After two months, his kidney deficiency was miraculously cured, and his body returned to robustness. His physical and mental well-being were beyond description.

(II) Internal and External Treatment of Women's Hidden Ailments

Patient Madame Bao, née Zhen, 24 years old, residing on Route Macgregor. Madame Bao was inherently weak. Due to heavy domestic responsibilities and excessive labor, coupled with inadequate postpartum care, she suffered from abdominal pain during menstruation and persistent leukorrhea, causing her deep distress. Constrained by traditional etiquette, she concealed her condition, delaying treatment. Consequently, her body weakened day by day, her breasts atrophied, and her beauty diminished. Last summer, her friend Madame Zhang Ziting suffered from the same ailment and was cured by me. She then accompanied Madame Bao to my clinic for treatment. I advised her on healthy living methods and instructed her to purchase half a dozen bottles of the ovarian preparation "Reproduction Element" from the Wing On Company's pharmacy department. After taking it, her menstrual pain subsided, her leukorrhea stopped, her body became healthy, her spirit invigorated, and her qi and blood replenished, restoring her former beauty.

(Note) "Reproduction Element" is available in male and female versions. Women should specify "female version" when purchasing.

### Old Russia Celebrates New Year on Avenue Joffre

Every year on January 8th according to the Gregorian calendar, the day marking the winter solstice of the collapsed Russian Empire, the White Russian men and women who wander in Shanghai customarily engage in a day and night of revelry. January 14th, however, is their old calendar New Year's Day. On this day, these more than 30,000 people abandoned by their homeland must, as usual, hold a celebration. This year will certainly be no exception. Although they have lost their positions of power and are no longer welcome in their homeland, I imagine they cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitude when they recall the glory and extravagant lives of the past Tsarist era.

Today, wanting to learn something about the Old Russian New Year, I made a special trip to Avenue Joffre, where the White Russians are most concentrated, for a brief tour. There, we naturally do not see the fervor of the French National Day, nor the grandeur of Christmas (the foreign winter solstice). However, many White Russian shops and residential doors seem to be adorned with the atmosphere of the New Year. With simple decorations and neat attire, they have quietly passed the end of the year and are preparing to celebrate today's New Year.

On the sidewalks, one often encounters small groups of White Russian young people, both men and women, all dressed in semi-new clothes, chatting and laughing, seemingly going to visit relatives or attend banquets. The White Russian children by the roadside are also playing mischievously. Like the Chinese children, they are happy and fortunate in the New Year. Naturally, they will never understand the sorrow of the adults, because they have never experienced the glorious days of Petrograd. Although they often hear their parents say, "When we were in Petrograd, during the New Year, it was truly..." These boastful words also contain infinite memories, but the children do not understand them. They only know that during the New Year, they should have good food, good clothes, and good fun, without thinking that they are the descendants of exiles, not knowing when they will be able to follow their parents into that forgotten homeland.

Wandering alone on that Avenue Joffre, filled with exotic atmosphere, looking at the modern goods and three-dimensional displays in the large glass windows, and then looking at the simple New Year decorations in front of the White Russian shops, I suddenly passed by the entrance of a Russian restaurant and involuntarily went inside. Ah! The frenzy here is a stark contrast to the desolation of several Russian shops. The inside is crowded with people, women wearing clothes of not very harmonious colors, young lads, but mostly those haggard officers of the Tsarist era with medals. However, now they have lost their heroic posture of the past, leaving only a pair of faces full of decadence and gloom. They are drinking wildly without any scruples, roaring, laughing wildly, and fighting. They all seem to have completely lost their reason, making the air very chaotic. But at the same time, I also discovered a Russian dancing girl weeping at an empty glass.

Why have they become like this? Perhaps it is life and the environment that have caused them to abandon themselves. I express my utmost sympathy for this group of wanderers who have lost their homeland.

The Russian theater at the intersection of Rue de Saigon is also performing operas today, and the Ukraine Society is holding a grand dance party. It is said that the Russian Consulate General will also hold a grand dance party today. In short, today is a day of revelry for the White Russians. They must temporarily forget the sorrow of being wanderers, the pain of life, and the glory of the past and the shame of the present, to indulge in revelry.

Today, Avenue Joffre has a different scenery than usual. This is the utmost madness and revelry in the White Russian shops and restaurants. However, I think it is more of a recollection of their past lives than a celebration of the New Year. Because, what is there to celebrate for a person who has lost their country!

I walked into a teahouse at the intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour, drinking tea while recording my impressions. But when I stepped out of the teahouse, an old White Russian man at the corner reached out and asked me for a penny. At that time, I thought, is he also celebrating New Year's Day? (Fang Zhou)

Film Review

### The Marx Brothers

— Bai Hua

"Room Service"

RKO Production, Nanking Theatre

After the Ritz Brothers' "Three Musketeers," I saw the Marx Brothers' "The Marx Brothers." People's impression of these Hollywood comedians is even less than that of Laurel and Hardy; sure enough, they are only good at "making a fuss."

Speaking of comedies, we will inevitably think of Charlie Chaplin (we will naturally think of him even more when watching comedies). His "The Circus," "City Lights," and "Modern Times" have been released, and we have been separated from him for several years. Therefore, when the news of his filming "The Great Dictator" was revealed, movie fans all over the world were afraid of eagerly anticipating the early meeting of this new film. And he has given up his previous insistence and changed to filming sound films. The so-called sound film, of course, is not just changing "subtitles" to "dialogue." This is in "Modern Times," we have already seen this Jewish artist's use of "dialogue." - The above is considered nonsense.

"The Marx Brothers" is said to be adapted from a stage play that was very popular in New York. The biggest shortcoming of adapting a stage play into a movie is that it cannot leave the scope of the stage, and the movie is performed on the ground; half of this is limited by the talent of the adapter, and it is also affected by the "presuppositions" of the movie. That is, like "The Marx Brothers," the entire play's performance is almost all within the bedroom of a large hotel, and the Marx Brothers are limited by the script and cannot fully display their "specialties." The only characteristics of a comedy that can be made are the piled-up dialogues. These dialogues may be the reason why this stage play was so "extremely popular for a while"; but it is not suitable for movies.

The story of "The Marx Brothers" is about a group of poor artists who are trapped in a large hotel. Not only do they owe rent, but they also have problems with three meals a day, so the hotel director issued an eviction order. Suddenly a rich man is willing to invest 15,000 yuan to stage their new play, but the check has a stop-payment problem. When the new play opens, this group of poor artists are imprisoned in the hotel room, and finally pretend to be dead and design an escape. When the hotel director discovers that the dead person appears on the stage, he faints, and the finale ends with a joint chorus of a lament.

Poor artists are encountering obstacles everywhere, which is "always the case since ancient times, and even more so now." Hollywood film companies adopt such themes to make scripts, such as "Dan Feng Chao Yang" and "Moon Palace Paradise," all of which deeply depict the encounters given to them by this cold society, making people give them infinite sympathy. "The Marx Brothers" did not even achieve this point, and on the contrary, it made people feel disgusted by this group of artists.

Director William A. Seiter also only fulfilled the duties of a director. Only when the playwright Davis pretended to be dead, and the hotel director Wiggler was at a loss because "human life is a major event," the Marx Brothers' prayers, sprinkling flowers, and singing elegies in that scene were quite humorous, and in a room, suddenly falling from a chaotic mess into a quiet atmosphere, the director was still able to grasp the emotions at that time.

The Marx Brothers' acting skills are still those exaggerated actions. Lucille Ball and Ann Miller have no roles to play, they are just decorations for the show.

### Anecdotes from the Theater World

— Qu Shigong

Mentioning Wang Ying will bring to mind Jin Shan, and mentioning Jin Shan will also bring to mind Wang Ying, as if there is an inseparable relationship between them.

Yes, in the past, the "Forties Drama Society" had long been said to be a husband-and-wife group of Wang Ying and Jin Shan.

"Wang Ying and Jin Shan," "Jin Shan and Wang Ying," this cry resounded throughout Shanghai.

Now, Wang Ying and Jin Shan are going abroad. My friend W君 wrote to me saying that they are going to the South Seas to perform and plan to donate some money to relieve refugees.

Wang Ying, she is from Anhui, but she herself said that she is from the Ming Dynasty. Her childhood name is Gui Zhen; "Wang" is her mother's surname, because she opposed her father, so she canceled her father's surname, expressing resistance and also showing demonstration.

Around 1929, she was introduced by Chen Wanli to the Chinese Literature Department of China Public School. After January 28th, she transferred to Jinan University to study. At that time, she and a classmate surnamed Wu from Jinan University were passionately in love, but for some reason, the two broke up for no reason.

It is said that when Wang Ying was studying at Zhonggong, there were simply an astonishing number of classmates who pursued her. At that time, she and several theater comrades lived together on North Sichuan Road, and they were often so poor that they did not even have money to buy rice. However, the Zhonggong classmates refused to leave there when it was time to eat. Later, they came up with a way to put up large posters all over the wall: "Wang Ying personally cooks, and each meal is two big coins." The business was unexpectedly prosperous, and in this way, even their own "bread problem" was solved at the same time.

In 1934, she jumped out of the "dark film circle" and ran to Tokyo to socialize with Japanese left-wing artists such as Akita Ujaku and emerging dance expert Nozaki Eifu, and surprisingly became popular in Tokyo. Japanese film companies repeatedly asked people to contact her, asking her to star in one or two films. It is said that Wang Ying originally wanted to agree, but later gave up after being warned by students studying in Japan. One day, an uninvited guest came. He was a Chinese student at the Japanese Police Academy. He asked to see Wang Ying, but after meeting, he did not say a word, only gave her a short knife and ran back.

After receiving this "gift," Wang Ying knew that even if she did not star in a film for the Japanese film company, there would be "bad things," so she packed up and returned to China.

"Life is precious, love is even higher,

If it is for the sake of freedom, both can be discarded."

Wang Ying, you once sang this song, I hope you remember it.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Episode 2: Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization, Instructor Jin Eloquently Discusses the View of Equality

In this tourist agency, there are female staff and male staff. In the past, it was stipulated that if the foreign guest was male, he would be entertained by a male staff member, and if the foreign guest was female, she would be entertained by a female staff member. Therefore, the number of male and female staff in the agency was equal. But later, the female staff became busy, and the male staff became idle. Why is this? Because most of those who come to China to travel come with their families, either with their wives or with their young ladies, and they all like to be entertained by female staff. The reason is that women are gentle and careful, which naturally makes people feel comfortable. Later, the agency gradually had more female staff than male staff. These staff members may have nothing to do for several weeks, or they may be so busy in one week that they are exhausted. However, the monthly salary is paid by the agency, regardless of whether there is work or not. In addition to the salary, they are not allowed to accept gifts from foreign guests. However, some female foreign guests often send gifts to them after returning home due to emotional reasons. I am now talking about Miss Jin Danyu. She had just entertained a female foreign guest a few days ago who came to China to travel. That female foreign guest was a wealthy widow from the United States, named Mrs. Sophia. Mrs. Sophia was originally an industrialist in her own country. Now that she has heard that China is booming after the war and has great resilience, she wants to invest. There are indeed too many industries in China that should be developed at this time. For example, many heavy industries are mainly run by the state, and many light industries are entirely run by the private sector. As long as it does not lose sovereignty, foreign investment is also very welcome. Mrs. Sophia also has many Chinese friends, so after staying in Shanghai for a few days, she went to other places again. I am afraid that she will still return to Shanghai soon. Since Mrs. Sophia left, Miss Jin has been able to have a few days of leisure, so she came to accompany the two Miss He to play. When the car drove to the suburbs, all the roads were newly built. However, there are not many houses by the roadside, only sparsely scattered ones, with a few bamboo fences and thatched huts, forming a rural scenery. Only near the city, houses have been built, many of which have been completed recently, and many are under construction. Jin Danyu smiled and said, "There are many strange sayings in Shanghai. Those newly built roads are still called roads. In fact, horse carriages have long disappeared, and they still use this name. Like Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, they are called Da Ma Lu, Er Ma Lu, etc., which is a bit ridiculous. It seems that your Guangdong is not like this." He Shuangyu said, "We call them what Dao, what Dao. In fact, Dao and Lu are not the same?" (14)
