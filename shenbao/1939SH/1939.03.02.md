The focus of the Japanese army's attack on Jiangnan seems to be aimed at Nanchang, so the reason for the delay in launching the attack is fourfold: (1) Due to the active Chinese guerrillas, especially the Lushan guerrillas, the Japanese communication is sometimes cut off. (2) Due to transportation difficulties, highways and railways are often damaged by the Chinese army. (3) Due to the low water level of the lake, the navy has no room for activity. (4) Due to the brewing of the so-called peace movement. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese difficulties are increasing day by day and they are struggling to cope. (Dispatch on the 1st)

Editorial

### Japan's Dream of Controlling the Concessions

Recently, because many large and small puppets of the puppet organization have been assassinated in Shanghai one after another, Japanese Consul General Miura has submitted two notes to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Rumor has it that he has made many accusations regarding the security issues of the concessions and requested that the concession authorities "cooperate" with Japan to jointly crack down on the so-called terrorist activities in the concessions. Whether the occurrence of these assassinations is the action of Chinese people eliminating traitors, or the mutual killings of traitors, or even a carefully planned trick by other parties for other purposes, we do not need to speculate arbitrarily before the case is resolved. However, Japan's special attention to the recent assassinations in Shanghai and its true intentions are very worthy of attention from both Chinese and foreign people.

Since the Chinese army withdrew from the suburbs of Shanghai, many assassinations have occurred in Shanghai. Many of these assassinations were based on political reasons. Assassinations based on political reasons cannot be eliminated by military and police forces alone, and this is true in any country. Even in the Japanese-occupied areas of China, where security is heavily guarded, the assassination of the puppet mayor of Hangzhou and the numerous assassination cases in Wuxi, averaging five per day, the Japanese army could not prevent them in advance or solve them afterwards. Shanghai is a complex metropolis, and the puppets who are despised by the people often carry out major activities in the concessions. However, the Shanghai concession authorities, except for the Hongkou area under Japanese military occupation and the areas beyond the boundaries of the concessions in western Shanghai, which are shrouded in the power of the puppet organization, where they cannot exercise their powers, have achieved very satisfactory results in maintaining general security. This is commonly recognized by Chinese and foreign residents in the concessions. As for the recent assassinations of puppet organization personnel, since the locations occurred in the area beyond the boundaries of the concessions under the control of the Japanese army, which is beyond the reach of the police power of the public concession, the concession authorities are of course not responsible for it.

Japan's attention to the recent assassinations in Shanghai is actually not for the assassinations themselves, but to attempt to control the concessions through this. Japan has negotiated with the concession authorities in various places many times in the past, demanding to increase its power in the concessions in various places. The demand to abolish the concessions has almost become a common argument in Japan recently. Japan believes that in order to achieve the goal of monopolizing the Far East and blockading China's gateway to Shanghai, it is necessary to eradicate the last base of European and American power in China, the concessions. Although the current concessions, such as Tianjin, Hankou, and Shanghai, have already become isolated islands in terms of the situation, they still retain a large number of Chinese and foreign people, and the economic activities in these places still have enormous power in the Japanese-occupied areas. In the past, Japan implemented the Japanese yen bloc plan in North China and tried to undermine the Chinese legal currency in various ways. However, due to the proper handling by the Chinese government and the absolute trust of the people in the legal currency, Japan's policy of replacing the legal currency with counterfeit money finally failed. Some Japanese economists believe that the concessions are the base for supporting the legal currency and point out that the concessions have a very strong political color. According to yesterday's Tianjin correspondent of the Shanghai-based North China Daily News, the Japanese authorities in North China are now forcibly implementing punitive regulations for using the legal currency. Because there is no concession in Peiping, the people can only yield. However, counterfeit currency is not popular in the British and French concessions in Tianjin, which is ironclad proof. Therefore, the concessions have become thorns in the eyes of the Japanese.

Moreover, the areas that Japan currently occupies in China are only some transportation routes and larger cities. Within these areas, except for the concessions, they have either become scorched earth or have long become worlds of vice and gambling. Originally, the main industrial and commercial activities in China were mostly concentrated in several major cities with concessions. Since this Sino-Japanese War, all economic activities in the Chinese guerrilla areas have been completely concentrated in these relatively safe concessions. Japan cannot achieve the goal of economic invasion if it cannot obtain control of all economic activities within its occupied areas. Therefore, Japan has recently repeatedly released information saying that it wants to abolish the concessions and consular jurisdiction of various countries in China. This time, Japan's submission to the Shanghai concession authorities for the Shanghai security issue is obviously a reconnaissance effort to attempt to control the Shanghai concession.

The negotiations between the Shanghai concession authorities and the Japanese side are currently underway, and the authorities in London and Tokyo are also closely monitoring their development, which shows that this is not only a change in the authority of the Shanghai Municipal Council itself, but a fundamental issue of the existence of European and American power in China. The British government has recently stated that it will never change the current organization of the Shanghai Municipal Council and hopes that other European and American countries that have relations with the concessions will adopt a consistent attitude with Britain and jointly prevent the development of Japan's aggressive ambitions. It can be considered that they have already had a considerable limit to their concessions to Japan. The Chinese and foreign tax-paying residents in the concessions should also unite to support the reasonable attitude of the Municipal Council to maintain security by itself, so as to avoid the autocratic police power in the special area falling into the hands of autocratic forces.

As for the Exchange Equalization Fund, it was established in 1934, with a total of $2,000,000,000, which was obtained from currency devaluation. Of this amount, $1,800,000,000 remains in the treasury and has never been used. At the end of September last year, when the situation in Europe was tense and large amounts of capital flowed into the United States, if there had been no Exchange Equalization Fund to adjust it, the price of the US dollar would have changed drastically, and it might even have jeopardized American commerce. The importance of this fund can be seen from this. (28th Havas Telegram)

### Espionage Agency Uncovered in Mexico; Linked to the National Socialist Party

(New York) The New York Times recently published a telegram from a correspondent stationed in Mexico City, stating that an espionage agency was uncovered here yesterday and a total of eight people were arrested, most of whom were members of the National Socialist Party. One of them is a close friend of German leader Hitler and is related to the head of the Berlin police department, Helldorf. This person was responsible for negotiating the German-Mexican trade agreement. In addition, another person named Bapinski used shortwave radio transmitters to send military intelligence to Germany, which was intercepted by the Ministry of Commerce. The Mexican authorities then conducted an investigation and solved the case. Bapinski has now been sent to the port of Veracruz and deported. (First Day Havas Telegram)

### Fisheries Negotiations at a Standstill; Japan Demonstrates to Russia; 20,000 Fishermen Prepared for Free Action; Rumor of Cruisers Concentrated in a Certain Port

(Tokyo) 150 Japanese fishing boats and 20,000 fishermen have completed all necessary preparations to cope with the crisis after the failure of the Japan-Soviet Union negotiations to conclude a temporary fishing agreement. They are currently waiting in Hakodate in northern Japan, intending to set sail this month. Regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, these fishermen are determined to fish in Soviet territorial waters during the next fishing season in order to maintain the rights they obtained after the Russo-Japanese War. Japanese newspapers mostly stated that Foreign Minister Arita's instruction to the ambassador to the Soviet Union on February 16 was the final warning issued to the Soviet authorities. If the Soviet authorities do not change their attitude, Japan will be forced to take resolute steps to protect its rights. According to Mr. Tanaka, a director of the North Sea Fisheries Company, speaking to reporters, "We cannot temporarily abandon our legitimate rights in the North Sea. Although we are now waiting for government instructions, we have decided that we will not give up an inch of our fishing rights in eastern Siberia. Even if we have to take resolute measures to deal with the situation, we still intend to set sail to fish according to the predetermined time each season." The coast of eastern Siberia is about 6,000 miles long, with 386 fishing areas scattered throughout the area. About 20,000 fishermen from northern Japan engage in fishing there, a situation that has lasted for many years. The annual catch is worth about 50 million Japanese yen, of which about 30 million yen worth of fish is canned and transported to foreign countries, and the rest is sold in Japan. The most valuable fishery along the Okhotsk Sea and the Bering Coast is in the river channels and ports, as these are the breeding grounds for salmon. Most of the above locations have canning factories. At present, well-informed circles are doubtful about whether Japanese fishermen can work normally in these coastal fishing areas in the face of Soviet opposition, because Japanese warships cannot easily protect them. The Japanese naval authorities are still maintaining their usual secrecy about what kind of steps Japan will take to protect its rights if the ongoing Japan-Soviet negotiations in Moscow fail to conclude a treaty. However, it is rumored that a squadron of light cruisers is currently concentrated in a certain port in northern Korea, and other warships are also concentrated in northern Japan in preparation for unforeseen circumstances. Right-wing members of parliament have recently urged the authorities in the Diet to seize the coal- and oil-rich northern Sakhalin Island if the Soviet Union insists on not making concessions.

### US Senate Discusses Rearmament Bill; Internationalists and Isolationists Debate Fiercely; Naval Exercises Completed

(Washington) When the Senate continued to debate the air force and army rearmament bill today, Democratic Senator Clark expressed fierce opposition. He stated that the United States is not in danger now and denounced the madness of those who drafted the bill. Clark also said that troublemakers throughout Europe have been agitating for a second war for twenty years and have used various scams to try to lure us into their shells. Senator Borah also expressed the same sentiment, calling the bill intimidation. According to military experts, the 3,700 new aircraft that the United States proposes to purchase actually exceed the army's ability to use them. The development of today's debate is that 12 isolationist members of parliament have demanded the restoration of the Ludlow Amendment to the Neutrality Act, that is, a national referendum must be held before the country declares war. Progressive Party Senator La Follette expressed strong support for this proposal, saying that this amendment would be the final deterrent to secret diplomacy that would induce us to join foreign wars. The United States suffered from this kind of secret diplomacy before joining the last world war. Democratic Congressman Lee expressed his support for the bill, saying that it was the only language that could be understood by the various dictators. There was also a lengthy debate about the issue of France purchasing American aircraft. Republican Congressman Nye said that the United States should stop selling arms overseas forever. How long will we continue to supply the world with arms, or even those who will use them to attack us, for the sake of a tiny profit? The Japanese aircraft that bombed the American gunboat Panay used American gasoline and bombs made of American steel. Senator Borah then joined the debate, saying that the United States had been selling military materials to Germany for years and only stopped this transaction after Germany began to demand colonies. This situation is a peculiar form of neutrality. Democratic Congressman Barkley and Democratic Congressman Lee both defended this matter, believing that it was perfectly justified for the United States to sell aircraft to France. Lee said that every aircraft sold to democratic countries is equal to one less that the United States needs. If they have the same strength as Germany, there may not be a Munich Agreement and the destruction of Czechoslovakia. (28th Reuters Telegram)

Miami: The temporary presidential office has received a message saying that President Roosevelt, after inspecting the naval maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea, has boarded the USS Houston cruiser and is heading to Charleston, South Carolina.

All the warships participating in the exercise are now concentrated in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of the island of Culebra (located between Puerto Rico and St. Thomas). The results of this exercise are unknown to outsiders. All that is known is that President Roosevelt held a meeting with various generals on the USS Houston cruiser. (First Day Havas Telegram)

### Britain Recognizes New Government of Spain; Labour Party Impeachment Motion Rejected; Opposition Condemns as Suicide Policy; Eden Says Situation Still Worrying

(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons yesterday the recognition of the National Army government of Spain, the opposition Labour Party immediately filed a vote of no confidence. The House of Commons submitted it for discussion today. Major Attlee, the Labour Party leader, first delivered a speech, criticizing the government's current policy fiercely. Prime Minister Chamberlain personally replied, and former Foreign Secretary Eden also delivered a speech in support. The House of Commons then submitted the vote of no confidence for a vote and rejected it by a vote of 344 to 137. (28th Havas Telegram)

(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Major Attlee, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, delivered a speech on the recognition of the National Army government of Spain, fiercely criticizing Prime Minister Chamberlain and accusing him of not shirking responsibility to other governments. He said, "Prime Minister Chamberlain's intention is probably to have French Prime Minister Daladier first state his position. Prime Minister Daladier actually rebuffed him, saying that this matter was caused by the advice of the British government and was subject to its pressure. Prime Minister Chamberlain's plan was not successful. At the very least, the Prime Minister should have obtained compensation for the British soldiers and British ships that were bombed by National Army aircraft. Has this been done? Prime Minister Chamberlain will probably recognize any government that violates international law and violates human nature. Is that really the case? The Spanish Republican government is a brave defender of democracy. Prime Minister Chamberlain stabbed it in the back. The spirit of our country, passed down through generations, will the government be willing to uphold it unswervingly? The various autonomous territories and democratic countries of the world cannot help but doubt it. The world says that Prime Minister Chamberlain always wants to befriend those who advocate violence and dictatorship. This kind of feeling will have a serious impact all over the world. The British people have suffered a blow in spirit, so the implementation of the national voluntary service system will inevitably be difficult. The British people are willing to join hands with France, but only if this France maintains the two great traditions of freedom and democracy and never becomes reactionary." (28th Havas Telegram)

(London) Liberal Party leader Sinclair then spoke, saying that the British government is now submitting a policy of "bankruptcy and suicide" to Parliament. The British government is now preparing to recognize a government that "cannot maintain its authority without foreign troops." The British government has strengthened the power of the various dictatorial countries and weakened the strength of the democratic countries. Countries that used to trust democratic countries have now been successively cheated and all exclaim "to have been humiliated in vain". Former Foreign Secretary Eden then spoke, saying that, regardless of the decision of the House of Commons, the Spanish issue will still be one of our worrying events. Britain cannot stand by and watch any situation in which Spain or any part of its territory, islands, or overseas possessions is under the rule of any non-Spanish power or is subject to part of their jurisdiction. He believes that insisting on non-recognition will encourage the continuation of the Spanish civil war. This is a terrible responsibility that he dares not take on himself. Therefore, he supports the government. (28th Reuters Telegram)

### Chamberlain's Defense; Recognition Should Not Be Subject to Conditions; But Franco Has Guaranteed No Reprisals and Has Declared That He Will Uphold National Independence

Prime Minister Chamberlain rose to answer, saying, "Major Attlee's fierce criticism of me is surprising. To deceive the House of Commons, or to avoid it by trying to make things difficult for the government because of the issue submitted for discussion, is not what I do best. Anyone who knows me well should recognize that." "Regarding the recognition of the Spanish National Army government, we are willing to maintain harmonious relations with the French government and will officially announce recognition only after France agrees. The matter of recognition was not confirmed until February 24th. If our country delays recognizing the National Army government, it will not help the Republican government or the people of Madrid, but will hinder the mutual relations between Britain and the National Army government. Britain has no power over the National Army government. It is difficult to believe that Mr. Attlee says that various democratic countries doubt the British government, because France and Britain are actually following each other step by step. After the Spanish National Army captured Barcelona and occupied the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, what the British government should determine is whether the National Army has gained an advantage and whether the Republican government can still be considered a legitimate government. The answer is very clear. No one knows whether the Republican government's organization is intact or where it is located, so it is difficult to continue to recognize it. Do the various opposition parties think that if Britain refuses to recognize the National Army government, the Republican government will continue to resist? If so, then it goes against the various rules of humanity. Recognition should not be subject to any conditions, but it is a different matter if you are preparing to resort to war. General Franco has repeatedly provided assurances to the British government that he will not commit killings indiscriminately. If we were to ask General Franco to agree to issue a general amnesty so that even those who have committed heinous crimes can be pardoned, would that be reasonable? General Franco telegraphed the British government on February 23rd, stating that Spain will never allow foreign intervention to harm the country's dignity and integrity of sovereignty, nor will it use retaliatory means against the opposition because of differences in political views. However, the National Army has now won, and the defeated must surrender unconditionally. All of this is enough to comfort people. General Franco is patriotic and magnanimous, which has been repeatedly proven in the liberated areas. The safety of Spaniards who have not committed criminal offenses can be guaranteed. In short, the Spanish National Army government has been recognized by nineteen countries. The urgent task is to end the civil war. The British government is willing to do its best to achieve this." At this point, former Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech, publicly supporting it, but also said, "The Spanish civil war has caused unease in all aspects for two and a half years. What we should know is that, regardless of the decision of the House of Commons, this uneasiness will still be difficult to eliminate for some time. Our country maintains friendship with Spain, not for monetary gain, but because both countries share common interests. It is hoped that this will not be misunderstood." (28th Havas Telegram)

### German Air Force Anniversary: Göring Takes Credit, Urges Redoubled Efforts

(Berlin) Today marks the anniversary of the restoration of the German Air Force. Following is a summarized translation of General Göring's radio address: "On March 1, 1935, Führer Hitler ordered me to restore the Air Force. Since then, the Air Force has stood as an equal alongside the Army and Navy. Since receiving this order, I have worked with my colleagues to rapidly develop the Air Force's facilities, never daring to slacken. The efforts of the Air Force personnel were closely related to the annexation of the Sudetenland last September. Last year, rumors spread, and tensions rose. If it weren't for our strong national defense and superior Air Force, the outcome would have been unpredictable. I am delighted that the Air Force can now be a powerful tool for Germany. In future dealings with various republican elements, the important position occupied by the Air Force will remain no different from today. Therefore, we must not be complacent with our existing achievements. If we do not strive for continuous progress, it is no different from rowing against the current. The Air Force's progress is constantly evolving. Considering the disturbances in various parts of the world and the tense international situation, how can we delay the development of the Air Force? Recalling when Germany had not yet expanded its military, Hitler proposed a practical arms limitation conference, but the great powers refused to accept it and now blame others, claiming that Germany should be responsible for the huge expenses of military expansion. Are they not oblivious to their own responsibilities?" Göring then elaborated on his plan to develop the great strength of the German Air Force, stating that development is not limited to raw materials and equipment, as the strength of German aircraft factories is extremely strong, and the excellence of their products has won international praise. The new records created by German aviators and the outstanding performances of German aircraft have long been widely acclaimed and need no further elaboration. Now, we should pay special attention to training excellent talent and never allow those who are not truly willing to learn to fill the ranks. Furthermore, the selection of Air Force officers will not be influenced by class or social status. Any German has the possibility of serving as an officer, without discrimination. The only distinctions are character, courage, technical skill, and performance. As for rewards, personal honor and service to the motherland should be foremost in the minds of Air Force soldiers." (One-day Reuters dispatch)

(Berlin) Today is "Aviation Day." General Göring, Minister of Aviation and Dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, recently delivered a radio address, recounting the achievements of the National Socialist government in building aviation. He stated that four years ago, when the entire nation suffered from unemployment and was in a state of enslavement, the first batch of aircraft built by the government was already soaring in the national airspace and was deeply welcomed by the entire people. It is important to know that peace enjoyed by those who are strong and powerful is not easily taken away by the world. We are not satisfied with the achievements we have made in the past, because complacency is regression. Moreover, the world situation is extremely chaotic and could trigger a crisis at any time. The Jewish agitators, who are also profit-seeking agitators, incite war and confuse people. (One-day Havas dispatch)

### Palestine Problem: Impasse Remains Unbroken, Jewish Representatives Insist on Original Stance, British Side Expresses Willingness to Revise Original Proposal

(London) The British government and Jewish representatives held an informal meeting this afternoon to discuss the Jewish refusal to accept the British proposal. This discussion has now been adjourned for two reasons: first, the British government needs to consider the general situation, and second, British Foreign Secretary Halifax recently contracted the flu and is bedridden. There are no current plans to continue the meeting with the Arabs, but today's meeting will still be held as originally planned. According to sources, the McMahon correspondence is expected to be released around the end of this week. Although there are still one or two points unfinished regarding the translation, it is generally complete. According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the outcome of this afternoon's informal consultations is that the situation between the British and Jewish delegations remains unchanged. The two informal consultations held over the past two days have failed to break the deadlock caused by the Jewish decision not to accept the British proposal as a basis for continued negotiations. It is said that the reason for the indefinite postponement of the aforementioned informal consultations is to give the British delegation time to consider whether the proposed recommendations should be revised and, if so, where to start. It is widely believed that the British delegation has indicated its willingness to concede on various points that the Jewish side deems not significant. According to a prominent Jewish representative, the postponement of the consultations does not mean that the meeting has failed, but the responsibility for resuming it lies with the British government. The entire Arab delegation met at the Egyptian Embassy tonight. According to sources, the main purpose of this meeting was to discuss the British government's proposal to resolve the Palestine issue this week. According to opinions from various Arab circles, the current British proposal lacks clarity, making it difficult for Arabs to decide whether to accept or reject it. However, the general mood is optimistic, believing that the British proposal can serve as a hopeful basis for future discussions, and that the British side may at any time clarify and expand it into a more practical plan.

### British Army Budget Totals Over £161.1 Million, an Increase of Over £46.7 Million Compared to Previous Year

(London) The new army budget for 1939 was released today, totaling £161,133,000, an increase of £46,714,000 compared to 1938. At the same time, the army's strength will increase by 15,700 personnel, totaling 185,700. Both of these totals far exceed the figures for recent years. Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha stated in the memorandum attached to the budget that, including normal supplementary funding, the figure for 1939 is £148,155,000, and the figure for 1938 is £106,500,000, an increase of £41,655,000. This supplementary funding comes from various sources other than taxation. The total amount of the current army budget is £79,000,000, which includes defense contributions from India, Burma, and various colonies, but most of it is allocated from the reorganization fund of the 1937 National Defense Loan Act, totaling £66,000,000. However, the figure stipulated in the 1939 budget to be issued from the reorganization fund is £66,232,000, while in 1938 it was £21,143,000. Therefore, the net amount borne by taxpayers is £81,923,000, a decrease of £3,434,000 compared to 1938. The conscription situation for the entire year is satisfactory. If the current rate can be maintained, the shortfall will be greatly reduced. During the fiscal year ending at the end of March 1939, the number of new recruits will be 40,000, while the final approved number for the fiscal year ending at the end of March of last year was 29,482. As for the detailed statistics of arms production, they cannot be made public for the benefit of the public. The acceleration of the rearmament program can be seen in the comparison of ordnance expenditures passed in the past four years: £9,073,500 in 1936, £25,032,000 in 1937, £38,383,000 in 1938, and £55,509,000 in 1939. Hore-Belisha further stated that this year is one of the most productive years in the history of the local army. (Second Reuters dispatch)

### Hitler and Mussolini to Meet Again in Northern Italy; Ciano's Attempt to Win Over Poland Fails; Berlin-Rome Axis to be Revised

(London) British newspapers in Berlin anticipate that German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will meet in northern Italy to revise the Axis policy because there have been various changes in Europe recently. Germany is quite disappointed with the results of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Poland, believing that the results obtained from this trip were extremely minor and not at all what was expected beforehand. German political circles seem to think that the anti-German demonstrations in Poland are a minor matter, but they believe that Ciano's failure to obtain a guarantee from Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck that Poland would remain neutral if war broke out involving France is of great importance. This situation, in terms of its impact on Italy's Mediterranean policy, is the reason for the two leaders to discuss general policy. (One-day Reuters dispatch)

### Counterfeit Currency Has No Credibility; Trade Declines in Pingjin and Qingdao; Situation in Dalian is Particularly Tragic; Japanese Troops in Tianjin Are Trapped by Guerrillas

The Continental Daily reports: A well-known American businessman who traveled to Beiping, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other ports in northern China returned to Shanghai. Yesterday (February 28th), he stated that due to exchange restrictions, trade in North China has been reduced to a barter basis, even this kind of trade is very minimal. The Japanese authorities strictly enforce new regulations allowing imports, which must be handled through Yokohama Specie Bank, and force Chinese people to use counterfeit currency, causing export trade to fall into a standstill. If import trade is prohibited for a long time, export trade will suffer the same loss. Importers and exporters in Tianjin and Yantai are trying to barter, that is, to issue export credit loans in exchange for import drafts. Of course, this method cannot completely offset the loss of exchange, but it can reduce the loss to a minimum. North China merchants believe that the Japanese authorities will not allow them to continue this barter system for a long time. Tianjin's exports are dominated by farmers' agricultural products, but since the Japanese army occupied the area, agricultural activity has been drastically reduced. According to those who have lived in North China for many years, farmers have indeed abandoned their fields in recent months and moved to the interior or cities. There are many abandoned fields in the countryside of North China. According to observations of the state of the fields, farmers are obviously not prepared for spring plowing. This is due to two influences. One is that the Japanese army destroys villages and seizes agricultural products for military purposes or in retaliation for the activity of guerrillas, so farmers no longer care about the land. The second, also quite important, is that a large number of farmers obey the scorched earth policy, leave their homes, and leave abandoned fields as a reward to the invaders. The Japanese authorities have banned the export of many goods that could be used for military purposes, almost completely halting commerce. As far as Chinese merchants are concerned, the implementation of commercial restrictions has instead made them focus on land, because most Chinese merchants feel uneasy about holding cash and want to quickly turn cash into property. They have no trust in the "Federal Reserve Bank" and its counterfeit currency, and although they occasionally use it, it is only under certain circumstances that they are forced to do so. Most of the Chinese merchants I have contacted are willing to exchange counterfeit currency for national currency at a 60% discount. I believe they are willing to exchange counterfeit currency for foreign currency at a 40% discount. Regarding this point, I can speak from my own experience. No matter what ratio the Japanese authorities set for exchanging counterfeit currency for foreign currency, it will never be fulfilled. I have tried to exchange counterfeit currency for foreign currency, but even the "Federal Reserve Bank" itself is unwilling to accept its counterfeit currency. After considering all these factors, it is easy to be optimistic about the future of foreign trade in North China. When the reporter asked whether he had seen signs of guerrilla activity during his trip to North China, the American businessman replied, "When I was staying in Tianjin, the Japanese officers were very panicked and uneasy. Two weeks ago, the Japanese army sent out 25 patrolmen to investigate the location of guerrillas, but they never returned. Two days later, they sent 50 more, who also did not return. Therefore, the Japanese army did not dare to leave Tianjin a step. The towns and villages near Tianjin and Yantai are guarded by Japanese troops during the day, but in the evening, they all return to the garrison headquarters and dare not go out until dawn. Along the Pingjin Railway, I saw a bridge that was being repaired. Others told me that this bridge was destroyed by guerrillas a week ago. Although I did not personally witness combat during my stay in the north, I was shaken by the sound of heavy artillery one night while staying at a hotel in Beiping, which did not stop all night. The next day, the Japanese authorities claimed that the sound of artillery was target practice, but according to foreigners in Beiping, there was fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops nearby. As for Dalian, which used to be a prosperous city, it is now completely declining. Seeing it is most disappointing. I was quite surprised by the state of Dalian, because before I left the United States for China, I still saw a book sent by the Manchurian "authorities," which contained photos of Dalian's prosperity."

The North China Daily News reports from Tianjin: "The currency situation here has not changed, while the situation in Pingjin is very different. Because Beiping has no concessions, the Japanese can forcibly impose punitive regulations on the use of legal currency. Therefore, the paper money of the Federal Reserve has seen a premium. In Tianjin, this counterfeit currency must be discounted before it can be used, and the amount of the discount is approximately equal to the amount of the premium in Beiping. In November and December of last year, there was a great shortage of ten-yuan and five-yuan banknotes in Tianjin. This difficulty no longer exists. Counterfeit Federal Reserve currency is rarely seen in the concessions. The Japanese authorities previously complained about the fact that British and American banks did not recognize counterfeit Federal Reserve currency as legal tender. What is strange is that the German and Italian banks in Tianjin, which are very friendly with Japan in the Anti-Comintern Pact, also refuse to use counterfeit Federal Reserve currency in the same way as British and American banks. The lack of credibility of this counterfeit currency can be seen from this."

### After the Fall of Hainan Island, Japanese Troops Have Not Been Able to Penetrate Deeply

Post Office Resumes Operations; Foreigners Are Safe

The Continental Daily reports: Yesterday (February 28th) afternoon, intermittent but completely reliable news was received from foreign sources stating that the Japanese army first occupied Haikou and Qiongzhou on Hainan Island, and then carried out the usual rape and plunder. However, the situation on the island is now much calmer. In the short period after the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, the island was in great chaos, but the situation now seems to have stabilized greatly. Although the residents of Haikou and Qiongzhou can return to the city, their furniture and other items have been looted. The Chinese army does not seem to have put up much resistance in these two places. Now, puppet governments have been established in the two cities and on the island. Since the Japanese army invaded, traffic on Hainan Island has been cut off. At present, postal and public transportation services have resumed in the areas occupied by the Japanese army. Japanese inspectors have been assigned to each post office. Foreigners on the island have not been mistreated so far. The Japanese army has not penetrated deep into the interior. The central part of the island is full of high mountains and dense forests. These areas cannot be invaded. Currently, there are twenty-three foreign missionaries on Hainan Island, all belonging to the American Presbyterian Church, including five in Qiongzhou, six in Haikou, and the rest in Nanduo and other places.

### Air Traffic Between China and Burma Increased; New Aircraft Purchased

Hong Kong dispatch: According to the Hong Kong office of the China National Aviation Corporation, the Chongqing-Rangoon route between China and Burma, which uses Douglas aircraft flown by Captain Schappi, departed from Chongqing on the 28th. There will be two flights per week, connecting with Imperial Airways flights. Imperial Airways aircraft test flew on February 1st. The route between China and Burma follows the Yunnan-Burma Road. Imperial Airways has built radio stations, temporary airfields, and other facilities, which have also been completed. China National Aviation Corporation has ordered two new aircraft from the United States, worth US$250,000, which are expected to arrive in Hong Kong at the end of this summer. These new aircraft can carry 24 passengers and have a maximum speed of 230 miles per hour.

### Zhoushan Islands Repeatedly Bombed by Japanese Warships

Destroyed Temples and Civilian Houses

Ningbo Correspondence: The Zhoushan Islands, isolated in a corner, are located on the frontline of national defense. The nearby waters are rich in fish, making it our country's largest fishing ground. Daishan Island in the archipelago produces a significant amount of salt, making it the second largest salt field in Zhejiang Province. The Sijiao Islands of the adjacent Shengsi Islands, under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu, are particularly rich in yellow sand. After August 13th, the Japanese army, for military convenience, forcibly occupied islands such as Shengshan and Sijiao to build airfields and wounded soldier hospitals, abandoning them after several months. The Zhoushan Islands are renowned nationwide for their fish production, which the Japanese have long coveted. In September of last year, Japanese warships sent letters to the Dinghai County Government and the Shenjiamen Town Office, requesting "permission to send personnel to conduct fishery surveys." Meanwhile, they also bombarded and harassed islands such as Qushan, Changtu, Daishan, and Putuo.

Shelling and Harassment: The Japanese, to seize fishing rights, colluded with puppets to establish a fake fish market in Yangshupu, Shanghai, attempting to exploit fishermen. However, the fishermen of the Zhoushan Islands, understanding the greater good, firmly refused to cooperate. The Japanese army then vented its anger on fishermen at sea. At noon on February 5th, three Japanese warships suddenly sailed into Dinghai Harbor, anchoring 400 meters from the shore. Subsequently, they launched speedboats to reconnoiter. The local defense forces, to protect national territory, fired a volley of shots, causing the Japanese boats to scurry back to their warships. Unable to land, the Japanese soldiers became enraged and fired nine shots, bombarding the area around Dongyue Temple (about a li from the city).

Multiple Temples Destroyed: Multiple halls were destroyed, and the temple keeper, Weng Asi, was killed. That evening, the warship fired eleven more shots towards the shore, with shells landing near the Xiangchun Restaurant by the Weitou Wharf. The next morning, it fired ten more shots before sailing away. At that time, the local residents, upon hearing the initial shelling, evacuated to the surrounding countryside. The city residents fled, only gradually returning home after the Japanese warship had departed. On the afternoon of the 16th, another Japanese warship, No. 4, sailed into Datou Harbor, anchoring and arbitrarily seizing civilian boats. After mooring overnight, at around 11:00 AM the next morning, it fired eleven more shells towards the shore, partially destroying the Taisui Hall of Dongyue Temple and a small section of the wall base. One shell also landed at the Le Laibin residence below the temple, destroying a veranda. Multiple shells also landed in places such as Yangjiatang and Hujiaqiao.

Many Shells Also Landed: A small number of civilian houses were destroyed, and one resident, Wang Xiaoman, was injured. When the Japanese warship shelled the shore, the Dinghai County Self-Defense Association and others disregarded the danger and ventured through the gunfire to carry out communication work. Although the residents of Dinghai were only three or four li away from the Japanese warship, they remained calm and composed, which was admirable. The Japanese army repeatedly attempted to land near Dinghai County, but two shellings proved ineffective. On the morning of the 21st, three warships of the Japanese 4th Destroyer Squadron sailed into the harbor opposite Gaoting Town on Daishan Island, north of the county seat, and continuously shelled the shore, firing a total of more than fifty shells. The shells landed in the Xinkaitou area, destroying parts of the Gaoxian Temple and Tianhou Palace, and damaging more than twenty civilian houses. The wife of Zhu Dufa was injured by shrapnel. Two more shells landed in the Lao Kaitou Xintongxing Native Produce Store, destroying several houses and injuring two shop assistants. Around 2:00 PM, the three warships set fire to six Shanghai-bound transport ships, including the Ruihong, which were docked in the harbor, before setting sail for Dongshajiao Town (a densely populated town with thriving commerce, being a major market town under Dinghai County). They shelled the shore facing the sea, attempting to land, but ultimately failed due to the strong defenses.

Ultimately Unsuccessful: In total, the Japanese warships fired more than twenty shells. Seven shells landed in Yangfu Temple on Tiebansha, heavily damaging the main hall and the front gate. More than thirty civilian houses were destroyed in the vicinity. Fortunately, the residents had already evacuated, and only one resident, Wu Awu, was hit in the head. Afterwards, at 4:30 PM, the Japanese warships set sail for Qushan. Currently, order on the Zhoushan Islands has gradually returned, and the situation is very peaceful. It is speculated that the Japanese warships' shelling was intended to harass the rear.

### Japanese Troops from Xiashi Attacked Dingqiao, Repelled

Haining Correspondence: Since the Chinese army recaptured Xieqiao and Fengshu Temple in Haining, the Japanese troops around Xiashi have been heavily guarded. Three hundred reinforcements newly arrived from Hangzhou, mostly conscripted men from Taiwan. The other day (27th), they planned to take advantage of the Chinese army's unpreparedness and launched a surprise attack on Dingqiao, a base of the Chinese army. However, the Chinese army had detected this plan early and ambushed the area around the villages. When the Japanese army's advance guard of over a hundred men approached Dingqiao, they were surrounded and attacked. After a fierce battle lasting about an hour, they collapsed and fled. Another seventy or eighty men in the rear were also intercepted by the Chinese army, suffering many casualties. A steamboat was also seized by the Chinese army. The Xiachang Highway, newly built by the Japanese army using forced labor, was completely destroyed by the Chinese army's special operations team. The Japanese troops trapped in Xiashi are in extreme panic.

### Five Thousand Japanese Troops Besiege Haiyan: City Residents Evacuate

Haiyan Correspondence: Haiyan is an important town in western Zhejiang, so the Japanese army once invaded, but ultimately failed. It is now learned that on the 24th of last month, the county was again attacked by the Japanese army from four directions. One route was from Hangzhou along the highway, with about seven or eight hundred men. Another route was from Jiaxing along the waterway, with more than a thousand Japanese and puppet troops. One route was from the direction of Xiashi, and another was from Pinghu, arriving at Xincang. The total number was about five thousand or more. It is reported that the Chinese army had obtained intelligence in advance, so the Japanese army was intercepted before reaching the hinterland, and a fierce battle ensued. It is currently learned that the Chinese and Japanese sides are still in a stalemate in their original positions, and it is also reported that the Japanese army invading from the Pinghu direction has had its rear route ambushed by the Chinese army near Xincang. As for the residents of the city, the county magistrate has ordered them to evacuate immediately to avoid innocent casualties.

### Terrorist Negotiations Reach Understanding: Concession Situation Relaxes

Japanese Commander Sakurai Visits Police Commissioner for Secret Talks

Cooperation Between Municipal Council and Japanese Police Becomes Concrete

Negotiations regarding terrorist incidents in the concession have made progress. The Japanese side submitted a new note the other day, indicating acceptance of the Municipal Council's suggestion to cooperate with the Japanese police to prevent the recurrence of terrorist incidents. Therefore, the tense situation of recent days has begun to relax and ease. Japanese Garrison Commander Sakurai visited the Municipal Council Police Commissioner yesterday morning to discuss joint prevention methods and measures in detail. The details are as follows:

Japanese Commander Visits Police Department

Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Japanese Army Garrison Commander Sakurai, leading Colonel Hirota, a military attache, and dozens of armed military police, arrived at the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road in several vehicles to visit senior officials of the Police Department. They discussed the Municipal Council's proposal to cooperate with the Japanese police to prevent terrorist incidents. Key personnel from the Police Department participated in the talks. Due to the serious nature of the matter, the meeting lasted for three hours. Sakurai and others did not leave until after 1:00 PM. The content of the talks is currently unknown due to strict confidentiality, but it is believed that the Municipal Council has reached a concrete stage of communication with the Japanese police. During the talks, the police station also dispatched many Chinese and Western detectives, along with the accompanying Japanese military police, to be stationed outside the door to maintain security and provide protection. Therefore, the situation in the Fuzhou Road area was very tense yesterday morning.

Terrorist Negotiations Come to a Temporary Halt

According to sources, after the Municipal Council received the new note from the Japanese side, it believed that the terrorist negotiations in the concession could be temporarily brought to a halt. The Japanese side now indicates that it does not want to escalate the situation and is leaning towards the Municipal Council's proposal, agreeing to cooperate with the Japanese police to continue to prevent terrorist incidents. Therefore, the only thing to consider from now on is how to implement this, and to discuss various cooperation details with the Japanese side. It is reported that the Municipal Council has already extracted the key points of the Japanese note and sent them to the directors for review. Once the principles are decided, they will hold talks with the Japanese side.

Western Newspaper Reports Nanjing's Attitude

The North China Daily News yesterday published a telephone message from its Tokyo correspondent, stating that the Foreign Ministry spokesman told him today (28th) (the correspondent claimed), "Japan is willing to sincerely cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Council. We will wait and see how the plan proposed by the Municipal Council is implemented. We sincerely want to negotiate a harmonious resolution to this dispute. We are willing to reach this resolution with the authorities concerned on the spot." The correspondent said he had sought information from various sources, initially believing that the Japanese authorities had a surprisingly broad view of the situation and that the demands put forward by the Japanese side would be very strict. However, the current moderate approach was unexpected. Therefore, the public widely believes that Japan does not want to urgently create any serious disputes or make the task of the Municipal Council authorities more difficult. The attitude of the general authorities is to accept the plan proposed by the Municipal Council to curb terrorism at face value and see how it progresses. The current trend is that they are at least satisfied with Fessenden's reply, but the authorities are still waiting for developments to see if new disputes will arise. If they do arise, they will decide on subsequent actions. As far as the correspondent knows, the Japanese demands do not include suggestions to obtain control of the concession, as reported elsewhere. According to the reports, Japan is likely to enforce its demands on the police power of the concession.

U.S. Marines Conduct Exercises

The China Press reports that U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment soldiers stationed in Shanghai conducted exercises in the Bubbling Well Road area this morning (1st). It is reported that this is not directly related to the current situation in Shanghai. According to Marine Corps personnel, these exercises are purely routine. However, local observers say that these exercises may have a psychological impact on terrorist groups currently active in the Shanghai area. The patrol teams that the Japanese army had added to Hongkou and the Eastern District since the Lunar New Year were withdrawn yesterday (28th). The Japanese side did not explain this move.

### Japanese Side Acknowledges Second Time: Attacked by Guerrilla Forces

Within the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Triangle Area

Ninety-Five Battles in One Month

Neutral Source Says Japanese Casualties Were Heavy

The China Press reports that a Japanese military spokesman yesterday (28th) revealed for the second time in a week the secret of the startling extent of guerrilla activity within the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou triangle area. He acknowledged that Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai and Hangzhou had engaged in ninety-five battles with Chinese guerrilla forces in the one-month period from January 21st to February 20th. All of these battles were fought in the suburbs of Shanghai, Jiaxing, Songjiang, and Hangzhou. The spokesman did not announce the number of engagements near Taihu Lake and along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. According to the spokesman's acknowledgment on February 23rd, Japanese troops stationed within twenty-five miles of Shanghai had engaged in two hundred and eighty-one battles from August 28th of last year to February 15th of this year. He claimed that seven hundred and thirty-five guerrillas were killed in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area, while the Japanese army suffered four deaths and twelve injuries. A neutral military observer claimed last night that the Japanese side's estimate of losses did not seem accurate. Because the guerrillas often attack first, Japanese casualties were particularly heavy. Recent reports from eyewitnesses indicate that they have seen Japanese wounded arriving at hospitals behind the lines in Shanghai, which seems to confirm the observer's view.

### Four Bombings in Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road Last Night

Fortunately Only One Rickshaw Puller Injured

The Four Cases Clearly Involved Planned Actions

Between 9:45 PM and 10:50 PM last night, four bombings occurred in quick succession within one hour in the central section of Nanjing Road in the Public Concession and along the Bubbling Well Road near the racecourse. The atmosphere was quite tense at the time. Fortunately, except for an injured rickshaw puller, no major tragedy occurred. However, due to the similarity of the explosives in the two locations, it is feared that the four cases are related. The police are currently conducting a thorough investigation. The details are described as follows:

Sincere Company

The main entrance of the Sincere Amusement Park, located on Nanjing Road and facing Yinghua Street, experienced a sudden explosion at around 9:45 PM last night, when traffic was busy and visitors were about to return home. The explosion occurred on the sidewalk along Nanjing Road in front of the amusement park's main entrance, shocking the surrounding area. The general public fled in panic, as if a major disaster had occurred, and order was temporarily disrupted. The nearby Lao Zha Police Station received the report and immediately ordered a large number of Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives to rush to the scene to investigate. Except for vehicles, all pedestrians were temporarily prohibited from passing. It is learned that after searching, the detectives recovered fragments of Three Gun cigarettes can on the roadside, and there were still remnants of explosives. The recovered items were taken back to the police station for filing. As for the source of the can, it is claimed that it was thrown from above. Therefore, the police entered the building to search, but there were no results. Fortunately, there were no injuries.

Yinghua Street

While the investigation of the case at the Sincere Amusement Park entrance was still underway, another bombing occurred on Yinghua Street. It was around 10:10 PM, but the explosive was no longer a tin can, but a small bomb. Therefore, its explosive power was greater, and the sound was louder. The bomb seemed to have been thrown from the direction of the Tianyun Building, landing in front of No. 11 Yinghua Street, Modern Photo Studio, with a loud bang, like thunder. Fortunately, there were few pedestrians at the time, so a tragedy was avoided. However, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei, Chen Youkun, who was soliciting business there, was injured by flying shrapnel and fell to the ground in pain, screaming incessantly. Detectives nearby received the report and rushed to the scene to investigate, and sent the injured rickshaw puller to the hospital for treatment. It was learned afterwards that the detectives recovered several pieces of shrapnel at the scene and sent them to the police station for safekeeping. As for the search results, there were no clues.

Cinderella Ballroom

After the two cases mentioned above occurred in succession, Nanjing Road was immediately filled with detectives, and the situation was very tense. While the detectives were about to report back to the police station and begin to study the case, they suddenly received another alarm, claiming that at around 10:50 PM, another bombing occurred on the sidewalk outside the Cinderella Ballroom at No. 444 Bubbling Well Road, near the Chu Bawang advertising billboard. The Chengdu Road police also dispatched a large number of detectives. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the explosive was a tin can, similar to the one in the Sincere Amusement Park case. Fortunately, the area was quieter, so no one was injured. All the fragments were also taken back to the police station by the detectives for a thorough investigation.

Daxin Company

While Nanjing Road was in turmoil, another bombing occurred at the entrance of the Daxin Company at the intersection of Rue Chapsal and Nanjing Road at 9:45 PM. It was impossible to explore where the bomb fell from, but the explosive power was very strong, causing the windows of a black-plated taxi in the concession, registration number 7917, parked there at the time, to be shattered by shrapnel. Fortunately, there was no one in the car, so there were no injuries. In addition, it is rumored that leaflets were also found at the time, but they had already been picked up by the time reporters arrived. According to bystanders, the leaflets contained warnings to those who indulged in nightlife, signed by the "Passionate Blooded Spirit Anti-Traitor Corps". All the shrapnel has been taken back to the police station for filing.

### Chinese and Japanese Troops Gather in Northern Jiangsu: Contact Already Made Along the Coast in Haimen

Japanese Warships Move to Lower Reaches, Tense Situation

Chinese Army Determined to Recover Lost Territory

In recent days, after the Chinese army's strength increased in the counties along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, it has formed an encirclement around the Japanese army's defense areas. The Japanese side has also increased troops in Haimen and Tongzhou, and several Japanese warships have moved to the lower reaches to be stationed. The situation is rapidly deteriorating with both sides on the verge of conflict. It is learned that contact has already been made in Qinglong Port, Haimen, and the war may expand. The Chinese army is determined to sacrifice to recover lost territory. The details are reported by the Xiandai News Agency reporter as follows:

Japanese Warships Move to Lower Reaches

Since the elite troops of the 24th Army Group of the Chinese army arrived in Tongzhou, Rugao, Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, and other counties last week and joined forces with the original stationed troops, their strength has greatly increased, and their military appearance has been invigorated. Therefore, the Japanese troops stationed along the Yangtze River are uneasy and have specially transferred Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Shanghai to Nantong Tiansheng Port, Haimen Qinglong Port, Dasheng No. 3 Factory, and other places to increase defenses. The Japanese warships originally stationed in the upper reaches have also been transferred to the lower reaches to concentrate and await orders. The situation is very urgent. According to people from Tongzhou, there are eight or nine Japanese small gunboats and transport ships, as well as many wooden-hulled motorboats, stationed outside Nantong Tiansheng Port, Rugao Xin Port, Qidong Sanhe Port, Haimen Qinglong Port, and other ports, all traveling back and forth along the Yangtze River. Three or four Japanese planes are patrolling the Yangtze River every day.

Rumors of Contact at Haimen Qinglong Port

After the Chinese and Japanese troops gathered at the ports along the Yangtze River, the situation became tense. The Japanese side is forcibly recruiting civilians to build defensive fortifications. The Chinese army is also digging trenches in the ×× highlands in Haimen and Qidong. It is reported that a skirmish occurred at Haimen Qinglong Port (between Niuhong Port and Xin Port) at 8:00 AM yesterday. By 11:00 AM, the gunfire had subsided. It is unclear whether there were casualties on both sides. According to a reporter who inquired about the Shanghai-bound cargo ship from Beisha last night, he heard intensive gunfire on the shore when passing through the port, and Japanese motorboats were traveling back and forth frequently.

Determined to Resist and Recover Lost Territory

After this reorganization, the Chinese army has not only increased in number, but has also greatly improved in quality, and various heavy weapons have been newly transported from the rear. It is learned that the Japanese army deployed along the Yangtze River numbers less than 20,000, while the Chinese army has about 100,000. Moreover, these Chinese troops have undergone several reorganizations and training, and most of them are strong and well-built. Currently, the generals in various counties in northern Jiangsu are loyal to the orders of Commander Gu of the Third War Area, determined to sacrifice to recover lost territory, so that they can see the light of day again and save the people from misery.

Rumors of Japanese Troops Landing in Hailufeng

Chaoshan and Hakka

Heard Telegram Stop Orders

The Shanghai-Vietnam line (i.e., Haikou, Beihai, Haiphong) operated by the British trading companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire has been running for many years. Since the loss of Guanzhou, the two companies have also connected Guangzhou Bay, connecting the mainland. Last month, the Japanese Navy landed on Hainan Island, so the liners on the Shanghai-Vietnam line have stopped at Haikou and Beihai to avoid danger. As for Haiphong, it once stopped operating due to full warehouses, but it has now resumed. Yesterday, Butterfield & Swire's Qiongzhou ship went to Shantou and Guangzhou Bay, carrying more than eighty pieces of cotton yarn. The other day (5th), Jardine Matheson's new vessel Yongsheng and Butterfield & Swire's Suiyang will go to Haiphong. The Suiyang will also connect Guangzhou Bay and Beihai. Yesterday, it was rumored in Shanghai that Japanese troops had landed in Haifeng and Lufeng near Shantou. It is heard that some Chaoshan and Hakka merchants received telegrams to stop processing goods. Whether Japanese troops landed in Hailufeng has yet to be confirmed.

### Ready to Raise the Value of Legal Tender Further Confidence

Fully Usable in North China and Guerrilla Areas

Circulation in Shanghai Reduced After Restrictions

Since the "United Reserve Bank" of the puppet regime in North China issued banknotes, attempting to exchange for legal tender and obtain foreign exchange failed, it used special forces to forcibly devalue legal tender in North China and stipulated that it would be prohibited from use from March 10th, aiming to disrupt our country's finances. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with financial circles yesterday and learned that our country's legal tender issuance policy is particularly cautious. The cash reserve has increased after the war. As of the end of June last year, the Central Bank was at 67.4%, the Bank of China was at 65.2%, the Bank of Communications was at 60.4%, and the Farmers Bank of China was at 69.9%, all above 60%, in line with the issuance regulations, which is deeply trusted by Chinese and foreigners. Legal tender is always fully usable in the North China concession area and guerrilla areas. The issuance of legal tender has increased after the war compared to before the war, and the national financial system is becoming more stable. Shanghai's financial institutions have gradually become sound after a long period of evolution. However, the government has been making efforts to restrict the flow of legal tender into the occupied areas, stipulating regulations on the restriction of carrying banknotes, so the circulation of legal tender in Shanghai has decreased. In order to prevent legal tender from flowing into Shanghai, remittances from other ports to the Shanghai concession area are paid in drafts for large amounts. In addition, the Ministry of Finance's stipulation that public bonds should be paid interest in Chongqing is also to prevent large amounts of legal tender from flowing into Shanghai.

Italian Ambassador Visited Chamber of Commerce Commander Yesterday

Italian Ambassador to China Marquis Francesco Maria Taliani de Marchio, accompanied by Army Counselor Colonel Pier Francesco Parini, visited the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Colonel Henry James Haywood yesterday morning on Fuzhou Road, where an honor guard from the Russian Company of the SVC paid respects.

### The False "Finance Minister of Jiangsu Province" Hao Peng Takes the Stage

Recommended by the Japanese, Harada

Spent 100,000 Yuan on lobbying

The position of Finance Minister of the false Jiangsu Province was previously intended for Yan Jia'gan by the puppet Reformed Government (it is said that Yan is the younger brother of Yan Jiazhi, the chief of the Finance Department of the Reformed Government). However, Yan never took office. The position was then concurrently held by Chen Zemin, the puppet governor of the province. Now, after more than half a year, the Finance Department of the puppet Reformed Government has appointed Hao Peng to fill the position. It is understood that Hao was able to obtain this lucrative post due to the recommendation of Harada, a senior advisor to the puppet Reformed Government. It is said that Hao spent 100,000 yuan on lobbying. Hao is scheduled to make his debut in Jiangsu today (the 1st).

Frugality and Disaster Relief Association: Remitted 10,000 Yuan

Already Remitted 55,000 Yuan

Please Continue Your Efforts

The Frugality and Disaster Relief Committee, since its official establishment on October 10th of last year, has now been five months. Thanks to the enthusiastic advocacy of various sectors and schools, the results have been remarkable. On nine occasions, the frugality funds have been paid to the Refugee Relief Association for distribution, reaching 45,000 yuan. Yesterday, the tenth remittance was made, totaling 10,000 yuan in national currency, bringing the total remitted to 55,000 yuan. The association believes that persistence is the most important aspect of frugality and disaster relief. It continues to appeal to all sectors to continue their efforts. Those who have pledged to contribute should remit their contributions monthly as scheduled, without delay. Those who have not pledged should actively do so and immediately send their funds to the designated receiving banks in the city to obtain the official receipts issued by the association. This will cultivate a spirit of frugality among individuals and jointly overcome difficulties in the public sphere.

Travelers to Colombo Must Be Vaccinated

Announcement by the Customs Port Director

### The Feikang Arrives in Shanghai This Morning, The Four Arrested Passengers Have Not Been Released

The German Consulate Strongly Protests, The Japanese Side Has Not Responded

Further Negotiations Will Continue After the Shipowner's Detailed Report

The Feikang, a vessel of the German firm Lürssen Shipping, departed from Shanghai at 7 a.m. on the 24th of last month, bound for Wenzhou. It was suddenly intercepted by a Japanese warship in the waters off Dinghai Island, outside the Wusong estuary, and four Chinese passengers were arrested. Afterwards, Lürssen Shipping reported the incident to the German Consulate, and the German Consul-General formally lodged a written protest with the Japanese side, demanding the immediate release of the arrested passengers, using rather strong language. However, as of yesterday, the Japanese Consulate had not responded, and the four arrested passengers had not been released. It is now learned that the Feikang, after sailing to Wenzhou, set sail back to Shanghai the day before yesterday and is expected to arrive this morning. The German Consulate will continue to negotiate with the Japanese side after receiving a detailed report from Captain Kerbe. The German business community believes that the incident infringed upon German sovereignty and obstructed legitimate business operations. At the same time, various foreign shipping companies are paying close attention to the case and its outcome, in order to jointly take appropriate steps to prevent similar incidents from recurring and to safeguard their navigation rights and interests in China.

### The Third of March Friends' Festival, Huang Jingwan's Letter to Poor Friends

Tomorrow (March 3rd) is the sixth Chinese Friends' Festival. As usual, celebrations will be held to commemorate it. The initiator, Mr. Huang Jingwan, believes that this year, with the national crisis still severe and friends scattered, there is no reason for joy. He hopes that his patriotic friends and overseas compatriots will publicly swear not to be slaves, to make equality of personality the sole goal, to do more to benefit the world, and to strive for human happiness. The following is the letter from Mr. Huang to poor friends in the interior: "Time flies so fast. It's the sixth Friends' Festival on March 3rd again in a blink of an eye. Usually, the Friends' Festival is the most

celebrated

of festivals, celebrated when spring arrives and is kind and amiable. However, this year, the national crisis is still extremely serious. We should maintain our usual caution, solemnity, and activity throughout the day. But if we open our eyes to look at the current reality, the iron hooves of the invaders are trampling on countless of our homeland, cruelly killing countless

compatriots

under their mad devil hands, looting countless of our property, and destroying countless of our houses and fields. Today, we, a group of people who are fortunate enough to have sought refuge on an isolated island, although able to live a not-so-difficult life, can still freely welcome this Friends' Festival. In normal times, the ancients would say that one should think of danger in times of peace. In the current severe national crisis, how should we think of the suffering of the people in the interior? Everyone hopes that the record of their life will become

more splendid.

A wrong path is of course what people with souls will never want to take, so they can only seek comfort in the spirit, say a few auspicious words, and make a joke to cheer themselves up. My heart is my own master, where is not a place for physical exercise, a place for patience, and resources for cultivation? All joys and sorrows, partings and reunions, are all created by the heart. Being a resident in the occupied area, hardships and difficulties are unavoidable. If you are determined not to be slaves, you can only endure adversity and bite your teeth, enduring all the greater hardships, and being pressed by

material inducements and force

without yielding. There is no question of seeking ease and pleasure now. Disappointment and decadence are not worthy of being good sons and daughters. Sincerity can penetrate metal and stone. I hope that poor friends in the interior will help themselves and each other. After each encounter with a setback, after each encounter with difficulties, you should strengthen your beliefs even more deeply. When you have strong confidence and also have the determination to obey authority, so that confidence and determination are mutual trust and recognition of authority,

all success

will be realized. Because of this time of suffering, one can test the rise and fall of personality, see who can truly love the country and who is falsely patriotic and only does superficial work. Poor friends in the interior, I think that on this happy Friends' Festival, most of you will have no heart to rejoice, but there is no need to be discouraged or dispirited and become passive. Cheer up quickly, how diligent and vigilant, in order to repay the motherland. Now, in what is called an extraordinary period, being an educated

intellectual,

whether as a teacher, politician, businessman, worker, doctor, lawyer, engineer, accountant, etc., should understand what one's own responsibility is, not to sing high-sounding tunes or shout slogans, but to do things truly and practically. Although we are on an isolated island and cannot go to the front to defend against the enemy or serve in the rear, doing some charitable work, promoting proper entertainment, using domestic goods, fulfilling our duties in production, and frugality in saving the country, etc., are also ways of being patriotic, because fulfilling one's duty to the country and the idea of patriotism are multifaceted and vary according to time and place, and are not absolute. A new era is coming, may all our poor friends prepare for new efforts."

The Post Office Resumes Acceptance of Parcels to Yunnan Province

Transportation Difficulties May Prevent Long-Term Service

Suspension May Occur Again Within Days

The Shanghai Postal Administration previously suspended the acceptance of small and large parcels destined for Kunming and Yunnan Province, along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, due to traffic obstructions and transportation delays, resulting in a mountain of accumulated parcels. Now, in order to ease the difficulties of merchants and facilitate the flow of goods to other places, the Bureau has decided to resume acceptance of small parcels destined for Kunming and Yunnan Province, along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, starting yesterday. Each parcel is limited to 20 kilograms, and the charging methods are detailed. As for large parcels, it is still difficult to resume acceptance. However, the number of parcels destined for the above-mentioned areas is quite large, and it is feared that the service may not be sustainable. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, suspension may occur again within days.

### The Mystery of the Missing Russian Boy: Family Refuses to Release Any Information, Rumors Say the Boy Went to Chongqing to Join the Chinese Army

According to the Continental News, the 12-year-old son of Mr. Strilezov, a well-known Soviet expatriate in Shanghai, disappeared two weeks ago. As of last night (the 28th), the mystery remains unsolved. Mr. and Mrs. Strilezov and the French Concession Police Department have refused to release any information on the case, as there have been widespread rumors in the past two weeks about an important "political kidnapping" in Shanghai. The reporter then called Mrs. Strilezov yesterday to inquire, and she

personally confirmed

the boy's disappearance. It is said that Mr. Strilezov is the agent manager of a certain Soviet import and export company, and Mrs. Strilezov is the director of the TASS News Agency in Shanghai. Since the boy's disappearance, they have not received any news and still do not know where he is. Mrs. Strilezov refused to disclose her son's name, only saying that they hoped to avoid publicizing the matter. The place and time where the boy was last seen were

also not certain.

The English-language Great American Evening News also reported that after the disappearance of the fifteen-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Strilezov, residents of White Racecourse Road, five radio stations broadcast announcements in search of him a few days ago, but without success. Some believe that Mr. Strilezov's son

secretly left his home

to join the Chinese army in Chongqing. It is said that the young man was a student at the Municipal Council Western Boys' School. He was not seen at school two weeks ago, and it was then learned that he had disappeared.

Tofu Shop: The Mistress Runs Away

Escaping with the shop's money with a shop assistant

Caught by her husband and sent to court for investigation

Yu Ziyun, a native of Ningbo, is over thirty years old. He has been running a tofu shop at 141 Market Street in the French Concession for many years. Ten years ago, he married Ms. Pan, a fellow villager, through a matchmaker. Ms. Pan is now twenty-seven years old and enjoys a dissolute lifestyle. In recent years, she has had an affair with Yu A'xi, a shop assistant (twenty-five years old this year). On the first day of the first lunar month, Ms. Pan took 300 yuan in cash and three gold rings from the shop and ran away with her lover Yu A'xi,

living together

in a room at the Yong'an Hotel on Maigen Road in the Public Concession.

After his wife ran away with the money, Yu Ziyun searched everywhere. He finally found out where Ms. Pan was hiding the day before yesterday and arrested the adulterous couple Yu A'xi and Ms. Pan and handed them over to the French Concession Police for investigation. Yesterday afternoon at around 3 p.m., the French police sent Yu A'xi and Ms. Pan to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District, stating that the defendants were suspected of

conspiring to steal

and requesting detention for investigation. Judge Qiu Huan-ying interrogated them, and the defendant Ms. Pan confessed that she had been married to Yu Ziyun for ten years and had been subjected to abuse by her husband. This was why she had to take 300 yuan in cash and gold rings and stay in a hotel, intending to find work outside and support herself. More than 100 yuan of the money she took out was taken by Yu A'xi.

Most of it was lost in gambling.

There was still 198 yuan left, which was confiscated by the police. Most of the gold rings were also taken by Yu A'xi and pawned for use. Yu A'xi then confessed that Ms. Pan spent a lot of money in the hotel in six days. He only had a few meals with her and did not use much of her money. Although he gambled during the New Year, he did not use her money. The plaintiff Yu Ziyun then recounted the details of his wife's escape and arrest, requesting that they be punished according to the law. The court asked Yu A'xi, you were a shop assistant in Yu Ziyun's shop, but you took the boss's wife

to open a room.

This is not right in law or morality. What else do you have to say? Yu A'xi replied that Ms. Pan took the initiative in this matter. The court verified the statements and ordered that the defendants be detained and re-examined on March 8th. The confiscated stolen money of 198 yuan and the stolen gold rings were returned to the original owner, Yu Ziyun. The two defendants, Yu A'xi and Ms. Pan, were then taken away by the bailiffs for detention.

### Anle Cotton Mill Robbed, Bandits Shot and Killed Chinese Police Officer, Mill Robbed of More Than 3,000 Yuan, Chinese Police Officer Xu Xiaotong Died from Gunshot Wound

Anle Cotton Mill, located at 34 Love Street, Bailinan Road, West Shanghai, was founded by Deng Zhonghe, a cotton cloth merchant, and has a distribution office on Nanjing Road. The business is doing well. Yesterday at 11:30 a.m., just as the factory was opening its doors and workers were leaving for lunch, eight bandits suddenly broke in to rob. Four of the bandits were armed with guns. Two bandits with guns guarded the factory gate, preventing anyone from moving. The remaining six bandits, led by two gunmen, entered the factory and found the factory accountant, immediately taking him to the accounting room and forcing him to hand over the keys to all the silver cabinets. The accountant refused in every possible way, but was eventually searched by force. All the cash stored inside, more than 3,000 yuan in silver dollars, was robbed. The bandits then rushed out of the gate to escape. Unexpectedly, at that moment, Chinese police officer Xu Xiaotong, No. 2067, was patrolling and was passing the temporary isolation hospital of the Municipal Council and was about to reach the factory gate. The bandits were also escaping to the factory gate. When they saw the Chinese police officer, they thought the case had been exposed and immediately drew their guns and opened fire on the police officer, firing five or six shots. When Officer Xu heard the gunshots, he knew something was wrong and was about to draw his gun to shoot back, but his head and left temple had already been shot, and his chest was also injured by the bullets. He immediately fell to the ground. The service pistol he was holding was robbed by the bandits, who escaped without a trace. By the time a large number of detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrived after hearing the alarm, the bandits had already escaped far away. They immediately imposed martial law in the area from Zhaofeng Park and Yuyuan Road to Bailinan Road, and searched pedestrians and vehicles, but found nothing. Xu, the police officer, was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment, but because he was seriously injured, he died. Currently, the police are investigating the case.

### Doing Good Is the Greatest Joy: The General Police Department Busts a "Landing Pickpocket" Gang, Detains More Than a Dozen Members of the Gang, Including "Pigsy," and Sends Them to the First Special Court to Await Rescheduled Trial

Zhang Mingde, head of the Chinese Detective Bureau of the General Police Department, detectives Yang Zhaoqing, Qian Xianting, Cheng Renkun, etc., learned that someone had recently organized a large-scale "landing pickpocket" theft organization, including both men and women. Every day, they rented a rickshaw and did not solicit passengers, but only patrolled the roadside with male and female accomplices. Whenever they saw a small cart or tiger cart full of goods passing by without anyone guarding the cart, the female accomplices would step forward and pretend to ask for directions, shifting the rickshaw driver's attention to the woman. The other accomplices would then take the opportunity to steal the goods on the cart, load them onto the parked rickshaw, and speed away. Countless people have been victimized. The detectives learned that these people were going to use the same trick in Huajinli, Shanxi Road, the day before yesterday afternoon, so they rushed to wait. Before long, Jin Gengsheng (aka Pigsy) from Suzhou, Sun Chuanhe (aka Old Chopsticks) from Xuzhou, Zhang A'gen (aka Little Hebei) from Nanjing, Xie Mingshun from Zhejiang, and Sun Li, a woman from Pudong, appeared, and they were arrested together and taken back to the police station. After questioning, they confessed that their organization was located in Room 208 of the Southern Hotel at 462 Jiujiang Road. The detectives then went to arrest Zhang Yanming from Inatsu, Jia Zhengcai (aka Dahua) from Nanjing, Wang A'gen (aka Wang Liu) from Jiangbei, Yu Jiada (aka Dahong), Liu Fuzi (aka Xu Shucai), Ding Yuting (aka Huazi), Yao Gonghuan (aka Candle), Wu Damao (aka Yinde), Tang Bangrong (aka Daluzi), Chen Binke (aka Little Mapi), Shi Guanghui, Zhu Liucai, Zhang Maoliang, women Wang Xiuying, Jin Lushi, Xu Mao, etc., totaling sixteen people. Ten pieces of cloth, one box of soap, more than fifty pawn tickets, and more than seventy yuan in legal currency were seized. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, stating that because there were many criminals involved in the case and investigation would take time, he requested permission for temporary detention and rescheduling of the hearing. After questioning by Judge Xiao Fenfen, the defendants were ordered to be detained and the hearing was rescheduled.

### Rice Shop Employee Infatuated with Gambling

Accused of Embezzling Funds

Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison

Ding Changyao, a 40-year-old employee of the Baotai Xin Rice Shop at 209 Market Street, French Concession, was suspended for forging checks and embezzling funds. Later, the owner of the rice shop, Zhou Langen, allowed him to write a letter of repentance and resume work because he thought his life was difficult. Unexpectedly, on January 5, Ding embezzled 826 yuan of funds again. Zhou discovered this a few days ago and reported it to the police, who arrested Ding. Ding Changyao was escorted by the police to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District yesterday and prosecuted for embezzlement. Judge Liao presided over the interrogation, and the defendant Ding Changyao confessed to embezzling 819 yuan of funds, saying that he lost money gambling in West Shanghai and could not make up for it, so he embezzled the money and asked for leniency. The plaintiff, Zhou Langen, came to court and stated the details of the defendant Ding Changyao's embezzlement, requesting that he be punished according to law and ordered to repay the embezzled 826 yuan. The lawyer for the French Concession Police stated his opinion, saying that the defendant's crime was not motivated by hunger and cold, but by a love of gambling, and should be punished severely according to law. Judge Liao verified the statements, concluded the debate, and announced the verdict in court: Ding Changyao was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment for embezzlement, and the attached civil lawsuit part was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.

### Strange Flower Sedan, Bride Missing

Zhao, a farmer who lived in Lujiaxing, Pudong, left behind a wife, a son, and a daughter. The brother had already married. The younger sister, named A'si, is now nineteen years old and cultivates the land with her mother every day. Years ago, she was promised to a Yuan family in the same village through a matchmaker, and received a betrothal gift of 180 yuan. Because the family was poor, the gift had already been used up by her brother and sister-in-law. This year, the Yuan family found that both sides were of age and eagerly wanted to complete the marriage. They chose the eighth day of the first lunar month for the wedding and sent a tea gift of 100 yuan for the second time. However, A'si was stubborn and could not raise the 180 yuan spent on the first betrothal gift. The 100 yuan for the second gift was not enough to buy dowry, and the countryside was not peaceful, so she could not borrow any money. She was afraid that she would not be able to face her parents-in-law after her marriage. On that day, the sedan chair from the Yuan family arrived, but the bride was nowhere to be found. The Yuan family was embarrassed by the delay and left the sedan chair at the Zhao family. Yesterday was the third day, and the bride had not returned. The Yuan family lost both the bride and the money and felt resentful. Over the past two days, they have sent people to the Zhao family to negotiate, but it is not known how it will be resolved.

### Patriotic Youth Organizations Never Stay in the Concession, Nor Do They Contact the Outside World Under Any Name

The atmosphere in the city's concessions has been tense recently. The Japanese side is using the issue of terrorism as an excuse to negotiate with the Municipal Council authorities. However, unscrupulous people in the city are taking this opportunity to impersonate personnel from the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government or representatives of the Ministry of Military Affairs, using the name of eliminating traitors and distributing anonymous letters in an attempt to intimidate and defraud. Recently, someone received a private letter from Hong Kong discussing the issue of the Shanghai concessions, stating that since the fall of Greater Shanghai, many young people in the rear have organized patriotic organizations to secretly go to the lost areas to assassinate traitors. However, these young people are pure and loyal individuals. After each successful mission, they immediately retreated to the rear or went to the guerrilla areas, never staying in the concessions, and absolutely never contacting the outside world under any name. True patriotic youth organizations would never bother to do this.

### An Eighty-Year-Old Woman Commits Suicide: Distraught Over Loss of Both Wealth and Family, Suffering Mental Breakdown, Crying, Refusing to Eat, Secretly Taking Poison

In Hangzhou, an elderly woman named Ge Qishi, aged seventy-nine, resided in Yuehua Fang, Huade Road. Her son passed away nine years ago, leaving behind a widowed daughter-in-law, Wan Shi, and her eldest grandson, Songwu. They had been working in Hangzhou, but in January of last year, due to the fall of Hangzhou, the daughter-in-law, grandson, and three others moved all their belongings to a Dong family house in Shijiatang, Lanxi. Unexpectedly, the landlord’s relative, Shao Baotang, from Dongyang, who runs the Shaoyuantai ham shop outside Matou, Jinhua, became acquainted with Wan Shi through a Ms. Lei’s introduction. Shao Baotang advised Wan Shi, saying, "Lanxi is dangerous; moving elsewhere would be safer." Mistakenly believing Shao to be a good person, she moved all the boxes of belongings to Shao's warehouse at No. 2 Gaojing Lane, Jinhua, and lived together. Shao seduced her into adultery. The eldest grandson, Songwu, aged twenty-one, was, in the second month, tricked by Shao into joining the army in Jiangxi as a new recruit, removing a thorn in his side. Until this year, there has been no news of him, and his fate is unknown. In [month], Shao’s wife learned about the affair with Wan Shi and rushed back to Jinhua from Shandong to make a scene. Wan Shi was severely beaten by Shao and driven out. She came to report to her mother-in-law about the significant losses. The old woman, realizing her daughter-in-law had been deceived and fallen ill, and deeply missing her grandson, suffered a sudden mental breakdown, crying and refusing to eat all day long. The night before last, she secretly took opium and committed suicide. Neighbors discovered this and immediately sent her to Shuren Hospital for treatment. Due to her advanced age, she is still in critical condition.

Employees' Communication Office of Two Railways Develops Relief Work

The employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Ningbo Railways, having lost their livelihoods since the cessation of railway operations, the Communication Office, representing all employees, requested to borrow a portion of their savings in May of last year, amounting to 300,000 national currency. This was approved by the authorities, and the funds were distributed equally among the employees as a form of relief. In December of last year, another 200,000 in fixed deposits matured, and the Communication Office, entrusted by the employees, made a second request. The authorities in Shanghai also took the plight of the employees into consideration and approved the release of funds according to the same borrowing method as before. The savings issue has now come to a close. The office is now focusing on relief efforts, retaining Dr. Gu Puquan, a doctor with a long history of service in the railways, as the medical director. They have also hired Mr. Peng Youwen from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Hygiene Department as an assistant, and have stocked up on various medicines and raw materials. Starting March 1st, they will continue to provide medical treatment for colleagues and their families from both railways at the original address. Surgery is available from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and internal medicine is available from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. In addition to medical services, the office is also planning to continue providing credit loans, and handling communication and other relief matters. The office's efforts to promote the welfare of railway colleagues are truly commendable.

### Letter

Dear Sir, I recently read in your newspaper on February 27 that Kong Wendou, who opened the Heli Flower Association at Zhujia Ku, Haige Road, led a crowd to destroy the Yongli Flower Association with guns and shot and injured a boy. I was surprised to read this. Wen Bao'an has been doing business and has never interfered with disputes. Not only has he not participated in the above-mentioned incident, but he has not even heard of it. Even if it is true, I think it is a mistake passed on by someone with the same name. It is absolutely unrelated to me. I am afraid that there will be slander from the outside world, so I specially wrote a letter to you, asking your newspaper to correct it quickly to show the truth. I wish you peace. Sincerely, Kong Wenbao, February 28, residing in Tianfu Store, Zhujia Ku, Haige Road.

Dear Sir, According to the person involved, Mr. Liu Zheran, on the 27th of this month, there was a news item in the Shanghai newspaper about the spread of opium in western Shanghai. It said that the local trafficker Jiang Yumen colluded with his fellow townsman Liu Zheran to organize a general bureau for selling opium, and paid 100,000 yuan in security to the Japanese side to obtain the exclusive right to sell drugs. After reading it, I was very surprised. Since the outbreak of the war, I have not heard of anything other than managing grains and transportation business. The so-called selling of opium is even more nonexistent. The news report was inaccurate, and it was obvious that someone maliciously slandered and fabricated facts with the intention of harming others. The matter is of great importance, and it is difficult to remain silent. Therefore, in addition to entrusting a thorough investigation in accordance with the law and publishing a statement in the newspaper, I would like to ask a representative to send a letter to the newspaper office requesting a correction. Accordingly, I will do my best to convey it. I hope you will check and take care of it. Sincerely, to the editorial department of Shenbao, lawyer Chen Chou.

Correction: In a news item yesterday entitled "The Progress of Disguised Exchanges," it was stated that Datong Company was reorganized after the failure of the previous illegal exchange and sold British and American gold tickets in name, and carried out disguised exchanges, ignoring laws and disrupting the market. It is now clarified that the company is absolutely unrelated to the previous illegal exchange. The company's organization is not a trust company. The business purpose is to sell various domestic and foreign commodities and real estate in this city and other places, as well as various insurances. It is definitely not just selling British and American gold tickets. It is a legitimate business, organized in accordance with the law, and there is absolutely no place similar to an exchange. Special correction.

Therefore, it was not cost-effective to transport gold to the north, so all the gold that had not yet been released was entrusted to a certain money exchange to sell it on their behalf. Therefore, although a certain silver building bought it on behalf of the local dealers, the supply and demand gap was still large, so the situation suddenly turned weak, resulting in a four-yuan drop.

### Cotton Yarn: The First Bustling Day Since the New Year - Over 5,000 Bales of Cotton Yarn Transacted

A Four Yuan Jump in an Instant

After lingering for several days, the yarn market, now boosted by the development of customer sales, has shown signs of recovery. Buyers from Nanhua and Yunnan are actively purchasing, acquiring a total of 1,200 bales of both coarse and fine yarn. Although the fine yarn business in the north has been encroached upon by other yarns, the demand for coarse yarn remains strong and continuous. Consequently, industry players, who were already anticipating price increases, are now further supported by actual demand, causing market prices to rise even higher. Some are even rushing to buy in the market, indicating a strong bullish sentiment. As a result, 20-count Double Horse yarn, initially priced at 395 yuan, quickly jumped by five yuan to 400 yuan.

It is reported that the Yunnan group bought 740 bales of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn and 230 bales of 10-count Dafa yarn, which stirred the market sentiment. The future lies in discovering new peaks, contingent on the volume of actual sales. In the afternoon, the atmosphere was enthusiastic, with a unified rush to purchase, pushing Double Horse yarn beyond the 400-yuan mark.

Industry Players' Pace Quite Chaotic

Regarding the current yarn situation, the opening market in the morning was relatively stable, with little change from the previous day and no price adjustments. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn remained at 395 yuan. Shortly after, news of activity from southern customer groups, coupled with substantial demand, suddenly tightened the market, and prices steadily rose. Buyers from Tianjin also purchased coarse yarn, and major industry players absorbed available stock certificates, further tightening the market situation. The closing price for 20-count Double Horse yarn reached 400 yuan. In the afternoon, both northern and southern customer groups continued to transact actual deals, amounting to over 1,000 bales. This strengthened the confidence of industry players, leading to more frequent and varied actions, causing market prices to become chaotic and inconsistent. This demonstrates a lack of coordination among industry participants. It is reported that the total transaction volume for the day reached a substantial 5,030 bales, marking the first bustling day since the New Year.

Market Fluctuations Today

With the market rising and the bullish trend strong, market sources indicate that industry players, anticipating future sales growth, are actively making precautionary transactions. The difference between the opening and closing price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 7.75 yuan. Based on this situation, if current sales continue to be strong, there may be further price increases tomorrow; otherwise, there may be a reversal due to excessive upward pressure. It is reported that the total transaction volume for the day was 5,030 bales, with inter-dealer transactions accounting for 2,000 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn increased by 7.75 yuan compared to the previous day, Double Globe by 6 yuan, Heavenly Maiden by 7 yuan, Special Golden City by 5 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn by 3 yuan. The transaction volume for each group is listed below:

Factories Seize the Opportunity to Increase Output

With the sharp rise in cotton yarn prices, factories are seizing the opportunity to increase output to meet customer demand. Dasheng is increasing output of 10-count Red Kui Xing, Qinfeng Factory is increasing output of 10-count Red Double Whale, Zhenhua Factory is increasing output of 10-count Double Dragon, Tongyi Factory is increasing output of 20-count Golden Rooster, Chongxin Factory is increasing output of 10-count Dafa, and Xinyu Factory is increasing output of 16-count Double Globe. The total output of coarse and fine yarn from various factories is 2,670 bales, mostly purchased by the Yunnan group, while the Tianjin group mainly purchased 10-count coarse yarn. The count and prices are listed below:

Japanese Yarn Also Driven Higher

Although the Japanese yarn market is quiet, the continuous rise of Chinese yarn has inevitably stirred sentiment, leading to a price increase of 2-3 yuan. The current price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 336-337 yuan, and the current price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 330 yuan.

Stimulated by the Country's Increased Import Tax on Foreign Cotton - Indian Cotton Base Price Soars

### Stimulated by the Country's Increased Import Tax on Foreign Cotton - Indian Cotton Base Price Soars

Lancashire Representative Goes to the United States

To Discuss Loan Cotton Solutions

Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market benefited from favorable Liverpool communications and widespread rumors that Lancashire mills, the gathering place of British yarn factories, were feeling the shortage of American cotton. This is because what can currently be bought in the United States is all inferior American cotton, while the superior cotton has already been loaned to the government. Due to the difficulty in purchasing American cotton, Lancashire plans to request the US government to release this loan inventory as soon as possible. A representative has already set off for the United States to discuss solutions with US Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace. The fabric trade is improving daily, with a massive 36 million yards sold in the past four days, boosting morale. The New York cotton market has been rising for two consecutive weeks, and yesterday it rose another 4-9 British pounds, India rose more than half a rupee, and Egypt rose 3-4 British pounds.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading, in the past few days, due to the inability to relax exchange rates, coupled with overseas cotton rising day by day, American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose another 4 jiao per dan yesterday, and Egyptian rose more than 3 jiao. Because Indian cotton is cheap, and all countries are competing to buy it, especially Shanghai, Indian yarn factories even tend to use foreign cotton. The government is deeply concerned that this situation is extremely detrimental to India's economy. Therefore, yesterday, an order was issued to change the foreign cotton import tax rules. From March 1st, foreign cotton imports will be charged double the original tax rate to show restriction. The short-fiber of Indian cotton is quite surplus in the country, because of the particularly high output. However, due to the small output of long-fiber, the basic price of Pingguoer · Oumola, which can be used as raw material for 10-count to 20-count, rose by half a yuan per dan in yesterday's Indian telegram. However, the base price of Bailuoqu · American Xinnt and American Penggapu, which can be used as raw materials for 24-count and above, surged by 2 yuan to more than 4 yuan per dan. As a result, yesterday's foreign cotton trading was very quiet. However, according to general observation, the soaring base price of Indian cotton may be temporarily stimulated by the increased import tax, and may fall back to a certain extent in the future; otherwise, Indian cotton will be difficult to compete with American cotton. The prices of cotton converted into legal currency prices delivered to the factory yesterday are listed below:

Yao Cotton Arrives Again - More Than 20,000 Pieces - Transactions Remain Desolate

The domestic cotton business is still very deserted, but the selling price is very firm, because the stock is exhausted. According to cotton merchants, the accumulation of inferior goods in various production areas has not been exhausted, but it is subject to a certain party's control, the donation fees and miscellaneous taxes are high, and the transportation is particularly difficult, so the source layer has a vague future. Therefore, the cotton market seems to be creating a situation of "having a market but no sales". It is hoped that the source from Subei will be after the Lantern Festival. Yao cotton has been approved for release, and shipments arrive from time to time. Yesterday, 26,698 pieces were shipped from Ningbo. The current transaction volume and market price of cotton are listed below:

### Piece Goods: Popular Light-Colored Cloth - Active Current Sales - The East Piece Goods Market Remains Strong

Domestic cloth of popular light colors are selling well, including striped and plain poplin, bleached cloth, bleached twill, standard cloth, and white printed cloth. There is active demand from northern and southern customer groups. Raw cotton fabrics such as light and heavy coarse cloth have also seen large transactions recently. Postal delivery to Sichuan and Chengdu has recently resumed, and the Yunnan group is still purchasing urgently needed goods and waiting for ships to load and ship. Therefore, popular light-colored piece goods remain firm, while dark-colored goods remain stagnant. The market also has its ups and downs, with white goods and coarse cloth being the strongest. The dyeing factories on this street still have stagnant demand for fine twill and fine cloth. The morning market continued to fall by five cents to one jiao, but rebounded slightly in the afternoon. The Guangdong and Zhejiang-Jiangxi groups purchased more than 100 packages of fine cloth, and Subei purchased more than 10 packages. Light-colored cloth is more popular in Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, with transactions reaching more than 6,000 bolts. Fuyu and Dongtai in northern Jiangsu also added more than 1,000 bolts of bleached cloth and poplin.

Eastern cloth continues to be firm. Dyeing factories on this street and industry players continue to purchase fine cloth and fine twill, with continued transactions of thousands of pieces, and the selling market is becoming more upright. Fine cloth with the Yanghe brand is the hardest, with each bolt priced about one jiao higher. Other brands such as Colorful Ball and Flying Fish have more circulating pieces due to the flow of industry brand names, so they are mediocre. Therefore, the price of fine cloth in yesterday's market was quite uneven, while the actual demand for fine twill increased, and each bolt rose uniformly by one jiao. The wholesale price of white goods is still high, and no one is interested. There are thousands of pieces of 12-pound Colorful Ball futures fine cloth opened by internal and external factories, with the price of each bolt at 12.306 yuan, including factory tax. Due to the shortage of patterns in spot goods, although the market is high, continued opening is carried out. Yesterday, Dongmian and other firms opened more than 200 boxes of printed linen yarn, satin, poplin and soft flannel, with printed linen yarn at 3.45 cents per yard, printed poplin at 3.7 cents per yard, and light-colored satin at 8.9 yuan per bolt.

Camel Down Wool Foreign Goods Groups Selling Well

Yesterday's woolen cloth trading was still lively. Unfortunately, in addition to pullover goods, ordinary and inexpensive Chinese and Western clothing materials are extremely scarce. Domestic camel down wool, with artistic stripes and plain colors, has a large transaction volume. Foreign goods groups have more intake than woolen cloth groups, because their market sales are strong, the profit is thinner than that of woolen cloth shops, and the scale is disturbing, so customers mostly adopt this product, while woolen cloth door shops are mostly embellishments. The matching of new spring, loose and tight camel down wool and woolen cloth door shops is far less complete and prosperous than that of silk and satin foreign goods shops, and most of their business has been taken away by foreign goods door groups. Yesterday, the wholesale price of the top camel down wool was 3.75 yuan per yard, the first grade was 3.25 yuan, the second grade was 2.25 yuan, the third grade was 1.85 yuan, and the fourth grade was 1.56 yuan. The actual sales of third- and fourth-grade lower-end goods are booming.

### Grain: Customs Has Said to Levy Import Tax - Du Geng and Ke Xian Fly Together

Hoarding Households and Shop Stomachs Are Actively Importing

The consignors took the opportunity to hoard and tighten the prices

As for the source of domestic rice, only No. 3 arrived at Hexia, with two or three thousand bags of car-transported packages. The sales market heard that the customs had said that it would levy import tax, and coupled with the limited sources, people's hearts soared. Large hoarding households and local shop stomachs are all lively. The sellers took the opportunity to raise the prices, and the situation was lively. For today's geng, the market has increased sharply. For example, the thick geng market has increased by 1-2 jiao, and the special thin rice bag has soared by 3 jiao. The Hexia goods have also increased by 2 jiao. The prices of Du Yang sharp tip and Bu tip seem to have not risen or fallen, and the middle price has brought a good price increase. The Yinwu to the road continues to be strong, and the supply is short, and it will rise by another 2 jiao.

Yesterday, the hoarding of Ke Xian by this Kehang was strong, while the consignors had the intention of hoarding and were unwilling to easily sell. The reason is that yesterday, each rice of the rice Jian in Hexia rose in unison. In addition, there is still a rumor in the market that the customs will automatically unban it, in order to avoid private statements and increase tax revenue, and that rice from the mainland will be taxed. Although the above two rumors have not been confirmed, everyone is heading upwards, and Ke Xian is being competed for by all parties. The total transaction volume for the day was about 4,000 bags, and the price rose by 2 jiao compared with the previous day. The price of Nanjing Xian Chongyangjian was 12 yuan, and the price of high-quality Wu Xian was also 11.5 yuan.

16,000 bags of white rice will be exported to Ningbo in the next two days, and it is said that another 34,000 bags are waiting to be loaded.

Flour Sales Gradually Stagnant - The Wholesale Price in This Street Has Been Reduced by 5 Cents

Yesterday, the current flour situation was loose and tired. Since the No. 2 flour mill disk has been reduced by 5 points from the red disk, it has been a week, but the wholesale price in this street still needs 4.8 yuan. As reported earlier in this newspaper, yesterday's market in the north and south was decorated with sporadic sprinkles, which was not lonely, but large transactions were rarely accepted. This street is generally in a state of not accepting small quantities because the Yang flour from Supri is dumped and the Muke factory disk is 5 points different. Therefore, starting yesterday, the Benke factory disk uniformly opened the price of 4.75 yuan, and the total number of No. 2 flours sold in the market was about 30,000 bags. Except for the 7-8,000 bags wholesaled in this street, the rest were sporadically handled by Yanjin, Fushan and other places, and the market was unusually excited.

The wheat market is unremarkable, and the source and inventory are lacking. The foreign wheat previously set by the factory is due to the delay of the ship and the arrival of the goods is pending, so the seller's intention is very firm, and it will not be sold without rising. However, each factory has foreign wheat applications, and is unwilling to release the price to handle it, and the market is held as before. The city only opened a package, and it was reported that more than 100 bags of Jiangbei wheat were traded outside the market, and the price was 6.8 yuan. This batch is not regarded as a formal market.

Australian Wheat Continued to Arrive

More than 15,000 Tons - Will Be Imported Tomorrow and the Day After

Recently, foreign wheat has been continuously shipped to Shen. Last month, the German wheel Jantze Fritzen loaded 8,893 tons of wheat from Australia to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 19th of last month, but unexpectedly, not only did the ship not enter the port at that time, but the news was also checked. The local agent of the wheel, Yitai Ship's head office, took the call to inquire, and there was no reply. The matter was bizarre. Then, on the 2nd of the previous day, he suddenly received a call from the wheel saying that he was going to Yokohama to load coal and would arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and the day after. In addition, the British company Trewellard also loaded more than 7,000 tons of wheat from Australia to Shanghai, and it is expected to be imported tomorrow. (Grandfather)

Miscellaneous Grains - Yellow Beans Turn Up

Yesterday's yellow bean market conditions, in the rising price in production, turned to masonry. Dalian beans resurfaced at 8 yuan, and the base price was loosened after the devaluation.

Japanese businessmen saw an opportunity to take advantage of the situation to open up. Ordered six cars to be delivered within the first period of March at a price of 7.96 yuan. The transaction of oil mills in Bengbu beans was opened, and the production price was reported to be high. Because the market atmosphere is easy to turn, a total of seven troops were traded yesterday, and the price was 7.6 yuan and 7.55 yuan, all delivered to the factory. The Chongming Sand Yellow Sales Market also turned lively. The local Guangbang allocated 1,300-400 bags, and the market price was raised by more than a jiao.

The price of Dongzhan goods is 24.3 yuan. The transaction of domestic sugar is still rare. The Chao Bang opened hundreds of bags of Shangbing White, and the price was 23.6-4 jiao. The price of Shangzhongdang Mianchi was slightly reduced, and 270 bags were opened at a price of 15.3-4 jiao. Guangbang opened 170 pieces of Beihai Pianqing, 12.5 yuan.

North-South Goods - Raw Peanuts and Raw Fruits are Expensive

Qingdao Newsletter, the raw peanut stock is not high. The current stock of Chajie is 70,000 bags, and the export team is 70,000 bags, so the market is very tight. It has risen to a height of about 10,000 since the beginning of the month. The red disk large kernel is opened at 11.9 yuan, and the ordinary is 11 yuan. It has now risen by 4 jiao to 12.3 yuan to 11.4 yuan. Only 10,000 bags of raw fruits are left.

### Shanghai Educational Association, etc. – A Letter to Teachers, Staff, and Students Regarding Fundraising for Refugee Production and Education Expenses

The Shanghai Municipal Educational Association, the Shanghai Secondary School Advancement Association, the Secondary School Teachers and Staff Union, the Primary Education Advancement Association, the Continuing Education Association, etc., have repeatedly convened meetings and made every effort to promote the Refugee Production and Education Fund. Now, together with various associations, we respectfully inform all teachers, staff, and students in this city to actively participate. The letter to teachers, staff, and students is recorded below:

Dear teachers and staff, dear students, the national crisis has reached a severe stage. Aren't we very fortunate to still be able to live and teach in peace? Let us look at our compatriots in the refugee camps. Driven by a sense of national consciousness, they left their hometowns. Some were separated from their most beloved wives, daughters, grandchildren, nephews, and nieces; some were separated from their most beloved parents, siblings, brothers, and sisters; some lost their most precious fields and houses; some abandoned their most fulfilling families and schools. In bitter winds and pouring rain, exposed to frost and moonlight, they endured the most tragic and difficult circumstances, struggling to reach safety, uttering cries of hunger without food, cold without clothing, homelessness, and powerlessness. They received relief from benevolent gentlemen and government authorities and were settled in refugee camps. How admirable and tragic this is! Do we not have tears of sympathy?

However, this war of resistance is a long-term one, and it is definitely not something that can be ended in a short period of time. Sheltering refugees is a temporary and passive solution, not a proactive and sustainable one. Moreover, the refugees in the camps generally do not want to simply receive passive relief; they feel ashamed and uneasy. Now, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has raised the Refugee Production and Education Fund, implementing refugee production and education, and establishing refugee production enterprises, so that refugees can acquire productive knowledge and skills, engage in production, support themselves, and further increase production and build the national economy for the country and society. This is truly a sound approach that achieves multiple goals with one effort and provides lasting benefits. Out of sympathy for the refugees, we should also sympathize with the Refugee Relief Association's campaign to raise the Refugee Production and Education Fund and provide practical assistance.

Realizing this, the members of our associations want to concentrate the strength of our teachers, staff, and students in various schools to raise 100,000 yuan for the Refugee Production and Education Fund to express our young students' enthusiasm for helping refugee compatriots. Therefore, the members of our associations have several sincere requests, hoping that everyone will make an effort:

1. Teachers and staff of all schools should save money from the Lunar New Year holidays and generously donate to set an example for students in their schools.

2. Students of all schools should save personal expenses and persuade their parents, siblings, brothers, sisters, relatives, and friends to generously donate and enthusiastically contribute.

3. In the shortest possible time, preferably within a week, everyone should gather the funds donated by themselves and others to purchase Leshan badges.

Our city has 150,000 primary school students, 100,000 secondary school students, and 50,000 university students and students in continuing education schools. With so many people, isn't raising a 100,000 yuan fund something that can definitely be achieved? The members of our associations wish everyone success in their efforts and shout the following three slogans to encourage each other: (1) Raising the Refugee Production and Education Fund is a true expression of our care for our refugee compatriots.

### Shanghai Educational Circles – Opinions on Educational Reform – A Few Opinions on Post-War Secondary Education Reform (1) – Zhang Wenchang

Secondary education is located in the middle of the educational system. Its target is the most lively and dynamic youth. Its function must take into account both general education and vocational education. Its mission must enable students to enter institutions of higher learning while also equipping them with normal and sound citizenship qualities, attitudes, concepts, and abilities. In this way, secondary schools become difficult to manage, and this is true in other countries, but even more so in China. Because education is the upper layer of the social structure, its foundation is the political, economic, and social conditions.

Since China adopted the Western school system (Qing Guangxu 28th year, Gregorian calendar 1902), nearly forty years have passed. The school system has been changed repeatedly, but little effect has been seen. Pessimists even believe that the country's poverty and the people's hardship are due to education, which only knows how to consume and does not engage in production, and only seeks superficiality and does not value practicality. Although this criticism contains a portion of the truth, it is not entirely true. There is no country in the world where politics and economics are not on track, and education can be done well on its own. Therefore, education is closely related to society. To discuss how to reform education, we must first look at the trends of society. Secondary education is a link in the entire education system, and of course, it cannot be outside of this.

What will China's situation be like after the war? We might as well predict it. First, China's sacred war of resistance will definitely achieve final victory. Second, China's politics will inevitably embark on a republican political system based on the Three Principles of the People. Third, China's economy will inevitably feel extremely difficult after the war, requiring international investment, government-controlled construction, and development, and therefore, a great need for talent in various aspects of construction. Fourth, China's education and culture will inevitably be more developed due to this war of resistance, and an educational system that adapts to its own needs will be established. Popular education and basic education (including primary education and secondary education) will inevitably be more widespread, and higher education will inevitably be more practical and in-depth. This is an inevitable trend. Because post-war secondary education will inevitably have the following trends: (1) The number of students will inevitably be greater; (2) The economics of general parents will inevitably be more difficult; (3) Vocational education will inevitably be more needed; (4) General education will inevitably seek more proficiency and increased efficiency; (5) Secondary schools will inevitably be more widespread in rural towns and small cities. Therefore, the following points should be noted for the reform of post-war secondary education:

First, because the number of students is greater, the original school buildings are not enough to accommodate them, and many of the existing school buildings have been destroyed. Post-war reconstruction, of course, requires general planning for the construction of school buildings in the future. In terms of quality, we only seek firmness and not magnificence. In terms of quantity, we should take into account the balance of classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and playgrounds, so that the capacity of the classrooms can accommodate the entire school's population, but the capacity of the libraries, laboratories, self-study rooms, and playgrounds can also accommodate the entire school's population. If so, then the Gary School System or Platoon System can be tried, so that one school can accommodate the students of one school, so that the number of students in classrooms is equal to the number of students in libraries, laboratories, self-study rooms, and playgrounds, so that classes, experiments, self-study, and exercise alternate, and every room and every field has no empty seats. Then it can accommodate twice the number of students. This is much better than the current half-day schools in Shanghai, where students are bored at home for half a day. Moreover, in this way, it is not just symbolic recognition and knowledge transmission, but also skill training and physical fitness training. There are classes and also guided self-study, which should be called complete education. (To be continued)

### West Qing Basketball Game Yesterday – Hualian Fought Hard to Defeat Guoguang – Shen Yugong's Issue Caused a Major Dispute – Other Taishan and Makin Won

There were three West Qing basketball games last night. In the first game, Moore defeated Taishan with a score of 43 to 22. In the second game, Makin also defeated Tianxing with a score of 74 to 29. The final game was between Hualian and Guoguang. It was originally scheduled to start at 9:00 p.m., but due to the issue of Shen Yugong's appearance, it was delayed until 10:00 p.m. Last night, when the game between Hualian and Guoguang was about to begin, Tao Bolinji, the scorer for West Qing, informed Sun Huipu, the captain of the Hualian team, that Shen Yugong could not play. Hualian retorted that they had not received prior notice. The West Qing clerk then hastily produced a one-page notice and handed it to Hualian, but it did not have the signature of the person in charge, so Hualian believed that the notice was unreliable. As a result, Shen Yugong still responded with halberds. After this turn of events, it was delayed by an hour. As a result of the confrontation, Guoguang took the lead in the first half with a score of 26 to 24. Guoguang continued to lead in the second half. Finally, Xu Zhaoxiong of Hualian committed four fouls and was dismissed, with four players playing. However, they still won with a score of 59 to 55.

### Generalissimo Chiang's Diet

— Shui Niao

A person who has regular eating and living habits can enhance their physique. Generalissimo Chiang has never indulged in reckless eating and drinking or lacked moderation because of his position of honor. He gets up at six o'clock every morning, and after doing a lot of self-cultivation work, he starts his breakfast at seven-thirty. The breakfast items are very simple, nothing more than porridge and some eggs and a few dishes of vegetables that Chinese people have always eaten. He does not like to take irritants such as coffee and tea, for fear of harming his body and heart. His lunch time is generally at half past twelve every day. In addition to his wife, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, accompanying him, there are also senior military and political personnel and diplomatic representatives accompanying him from time to time. His daily dishes are mostly Chinese food, and he uses no more than five or six dishes each time. He also eats Western food occasionally every week, but it is also very simple, no more than four to six courses, and they are mostly vegetarian. He takes dinner on average between half past seven and eight o'clock every night, and his dishes are similar to those at lunch. After each meal, fruits such as oranges are common side dishes, also because these fruits help digestion; for the same reason, he loves Chinese cabbage the most. However, he has never drunk any kind of alcohol, whether it is Chinese old wine or foreign wine, for more than ten years. It is said that even beverages such as wine were only drunk when he and Ms. Soong Mei-ling got married. As for smoking to pass the time after a meal, as is common among people, this is also something that Generalissimo Chiang does not do. In the precepts he wrote for the Lixing Society, he warned soldiers, "Don't smoke! Don't drink!" He also revealed in the New Life Movement he has been advocating in recent years that there is encouragement not to smoke and not to drink: And he himself can set an example everywhere, which can give us a model!

### Eating Hygiene

— Doctor Zhang Wenhua

The rampant nature of stomach and intestinal diseases in China is really worse than tuberculosis. The saying that disease enters through the mouth is really accurate for stomach and intestinal diseases. It is of course known to everyone that food should be chosen that is easy to digest and does not harm the stomach. But how can it not harm the stomach? People have already avoided a lot of trouble by not being completely Westernized and liking to eat raw vegetables: You must know that the fertilizer for planting land cannot be popularized in China, and the feces containing most of the insect eggs are still used. Fortunately, the habit is to eat it cooked, but this still cannot sit back and relax. You also have to give up the habit of stimulants, such as pepper, chili, and sour vinegar. Eating less can indeed promote your appetite, but after eating for a long time, your risk is invisibly damaged, isn't it? After a long time, you feel that you must have it to eat, without it, you simply cannot swallow, in fact, your appetite is invisibly decreasing, on the contrary, your appetite is abnormally increasing, which shows that the secretion of gastric acid has increased due to your constant stimulation, although food is very easy to digest, (that is, the corrosive effect of hydrochloric acid,) and your gastric mucosa is also corroded to form ulcers; how terrible this is! Although there are effective methods of treatment, it has already had a great impact on your spirit! Speaking of the temperature of food, people have always known that raw and cold things should not be eaten, and too hot things are also inappropriate. Cold feet cause anemia of the gastric mucosa and reduce gastric acid secretion, so that food is not easy to digest, too hot? Can make the gastric mucosa hyperemia and increase secretion, as a result, it is the same misfortune as eating stimulants. The Chinese people like to "eat while it's hot," allowing things like pot rice soup to be fresh only when it's hot, which is simply a bad habit that has a great impact on personal health and the future of the country.

### Huangqiao Sesame Cake, Which Became Famous Overnight

— Shuxia

On Guofu Road in Nanjing, there is a Huangqiao Sesame Cake shop. The boss of this shop is a native of Huangqiao, Taixing. He used the "place name" of his hometown as the "name" of his shop, and the sesame cakes produced in his shop are also named "Huangqiao."

Huangqiao Sesame Cake is similar in form to ordinary "large cakes," but the content is different. It is as loose and crispy as "seashell cakes," and it also contains things. Therefore, every morning, he has servants buy a few to fill his hunger. Soon, the general civil servants of Guofu also followed suit and bought them, so Huangqiao sesame cakes replaced large cakes and fried dough sticks and filled the Guofu's office. In this way, it spread from ten to ten, and from ten to a hundred. There are red bean paste or pickled mustard tuber pork floss wrapped inside, so it tastes better than "seashell cakes," and the price is very cheap, only selling for three cents per piece. This shop is near my alma mater, so I am almost a regular customer there.

Later, I don't know how, this kind of Huangqiao sesame cake was eaten by our chief Chairman Lin, who praised this cheap and good Huangqiao sesame cake's free advertisement, and it spread throughout the city in a very short period of time, and everyone came to buy it. Therefore, the sales of Huangqiao sesame cakes greatly increased, and the boss also gradually became rich.

After this transformation, I don't know if this lucky one – the Huangqiao Sesame Cake shop – can still exist safely?

Gentlemen who eat tonics! Please think about the refugees outside the window!

### Food in Chengdu

— Najue

Before the war, Chengdu was a very elegant, leisurely, and comfortable society, so in any street, you can always find one or two tea houses and restaurants, and it is "customers are always full, and tea is never empty in the cup."

According to the survey statistics in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, there were 82,177 households in Chengdu, with a total population of 438,995 people, and there were 6,552 food and beverage establishments in Chengdu. As for the street food vendors, they are not included in the statistics. If we make a ratio between the population and the number of food and beverage establishments, it is enough to prove the special development of the catering industry in Chengdu. Now that Chengdu has become an important town in the rear after the Chengdu Mouth, the population has surged to about 600,000, so the number of food and beverage establishments must be even more prosperous.

The signs of Chengdu's general tea houses and restaurants are also unique; even the smallest tea garden is called "Hunyuan." A very ordinary restaurant is shamelessly called "Weiyu." A small hotel is named "Temporary Living Maintenance Office," which is also a fact. The one selling bean milk is called "the one selling milk by the Wanli Bridge," and the small shop selling wine is called "the small tavern where you won't go home until you're drunk," which is so poetic.

"Guguyan" is the most famous restaurant in Chengdu; the owner, Huang Jinling, is a master of cooking. He used to be a prefect, but now he has retired from his career and opened a restaurant in Chengdu with his entire family. Old Huang is nearly 70 years old, as strong as a young man. Everything is done by himself, and his skills are outstanding, so the people of Chengdu regard hosting guests at Guguyan as elegant and generous. The prices there are naturally higher than the public, but business is booming, and reservations are full every day. The most surprising thing is that guests are not allowed to order dishes at will.

Old Huang has a collection of ten thousand volumes of books. When he puts down the spatula, he has a volume in his hand. Every year, he writes a pair of humorous spring couplets. Now, I will transcribe three links to show his humor, which is also a good story in the catering industry: (1) "It's a pity that I have been reading books for sixty years, and I am still a cook. It takes some effort to make the flavors of twenty-two provinces." (2) "Make some shark fin and bird's nest to welcome all the masters and madams. Drop a little leftover soup and rice to feed our adults and children." (3) "From the cook on the side of the pot, the town guard was promoted to the stewed general. This good title is definitely more magnanimous than theirs. With the blessing of Mr. Li Lao in the temple and the food Bodhisattva, this year's flower market should show a little magic power."

### Food for Canada's Quintuplets

— (Shuzhai)

The birth of quintuplets in Canada is one of the most sensational events worldwide in recent years. Many merchandise businesses use their names as trademarks, film companies specifically record their daily lives, and newspapers and magazines around the world publish articles heavily promoting them. At the same time, people all over the world are concerned about their lives: clothing, food, shelter, and transportation.

Here, let me tell you some things about what they eat in a day. Also, mothers, please take note that if you want your children to be healthy, in addition to paying attention to the starch in their food, you should also eat more things containing minerals and vitamins. This is because the Canadian quintuplets are lively and healthy because they often eat foods that are rich in nutrients!

Below is their daily food chart:

6:30 AM! Four ounces of oranges and cod liver oil.

8:10 AM! One egg, a large slice of buttered bread, tapioca pancakes, and five ounces of milk.

4:00 PM! Two slices of buttered bread and oxygenated milk.

4:30 PM! Tomato juice mixed with cod liver oil.

6:00 PM! Oatmeal porridge, four to five ounces of milk, bread, and butter.

(In addition to regular milk, each child has a small amount of oxygenated milk before meals, totaling about twenty ounces.)

The above food chart was prescribed by Dr. Dafoe, who cares for them.

### A Week's Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

During the Spring Festival, you ate a lot of rich fish and meat, and maybe you feel too greasy; so you really need something lighter to adjust. In Monday's menu, I have included two light dishes, one is shredded chicken mixed with water celery, and the other is clam crucian carp soup, which will be very appetizing. At the end of the year, chicken prices have soared. Each chicken weighing more than three catties costs about four yuan, which really makes people dare not move their index fingers. However, ancestor worship and entertaining relatives and friends still require it, so you have to reluctantly buy one or two. If you are thrifty, then there may be some leftover white chicken, which can be shredded and mixed with water celery. Water celery must be blanched in boiling water, and mixed with soy sauce, sesame oil or sesame paste, which is very palatable. If there is no chicken, then use leaner shredded meat as a substitute, and add some shredded egg skin, which is also acceptable. As for the price of clams, it is not expensive. Buy more than a dozen of them and stew them with crucian carp to increase its flavor.

Monday: Shredded Chicken with Water Celery, Clam Crucian Carp Soup, Vinegar Shredded Mustard Greens, Stir-fried Dwarf Cabbage

Tuesday: Curry Beef, Braised Bream, Shrimp Tofu, Stir-fried Water Chestnut Cabbage

Wednesday: Cauliflower Stir-fried with Sliced ​​Meat, Pickled Cabbage with Small Yellow Croaker, Bamboo Shoot and Vermicelli Soup, Raw Malabar Spinach

Thursday: Braised Lamb, Pan-fried Ribbonfish, Stir-fried Cabbage Heart, Braised Radish

Friday: Shepherd's Purse Stir-fried with Shredded Meat, Braised Prawn Slices, Shrimp Stir-fried with Gluten, Scallion Oil Shredded Radish

Saturday: Fried Tofu Stuffed with Meat, Braised Small Mandarin Fish, Pickled Cabbage Tofu, Pea Sprouts and Fried Bamboo Shoot Slices

Sunday: Lion's Head Meatballs, Fried Egg, Stir-fried Spinach, Soy Bean Sprouts

### Practice Non-Cooperation

— Mao Lie

Unless they are traitors, who would cooperate with the enemy?

After all, traitors are a very small minority, and the cooperation they engage in does not have any significant effect. This is something we can take comfort in from the beginning of the war of resistance to the present.

However, I now have a worry: among compatriots who are absolutely not traitors, some are unknowingly cooperating with the enemy, subtly increasing the enemy's power. I cannot but point out this trend and appeal to our compatriots to practice non-cooperation to prevent the possible adverse effects and any disastrous consequences.

The most common form of invisible cooperation is applying for passes from the enemy. What is this: we are walking on our own land, and we have to apply for passes from them! Of course, those who go to apply for passes are not unpatriotic, and there are their own unavoidable difficulties in applying for passes. But let's think about it: what is the difference between this and recognizing their sovereignty and becoming their obedient subjects? Over time, who can say that it will not be taken for granted, become a habit, and forget one's original identity? Who can say that they will not take this opportunity to become self-important and make further use of it? As for the various pains, mental and physical, suffered when applying for and using this pass, they are minor matters, but they are already enough to make people frown in distress.

In addition, in the occupied areas, according to various rumors, there are inevitably people who are not traitors but who petition the enemy to redress grievances and seek justice, or request certain conveniences that seem to be irrelevant to the overall situation. I believe that such actions are also cooperating with the enemy invisibly and helping to increase the enemy's power.

I believe that in the present situation, in any matter, public or private, we can only avoid the suspicion of cooperating with the enemy by not dealing with them. Even if it is absolutely necessary and there is no other way to think of it, there is a need to do it occasionally, we should also try our best to reduce the number of times. In any other matter, in short, do not deal with them, that is the right way. It is better to suffer losses from our own people and get angry with our own people than to receive preferential treatment from the enemy, especially since they will never treat us well!

Byron said in "The Giaour," "A tyrant is nothing, if of our own nation." I appeal to our compatriots to consider these words carefully!

### Old Baldy Ding Di

The sound of gunfire surrounded us from all directions, closer, fiercer, and denser.

A stray bullet fell from the sky, hitting the edge of the large pond, covered in wet mud, without exploding: it rolled over and over, stirring up a cloud of mud.

With a face full of mud, Little Baldy ran home.

"War! War! The Japanese devils have reached the village!"

Immediately, the hand of terror gripped the hearts of all the people in Yifuzhen. The heart was weak, while terror was so great and so deep.

A few people who were used to being calm spoke up:

"Don't panic! The Japanese soldiers must be here to suppress the guerrillas. We ordinary people are safe."

"Hey! Don't talk nonsense!"

"Let's hide quickly! Hide! Those of you with young men and women, hide quickly!"

Where to hide? At this moment, beside the melon shed, under the embankment, behind the cow, in the haystack...

Old Baldy Wang was not hiding. The little baldies crawled into the haystack, poked their heads out, and waved to him, but he ignored them. He took out an early tobacco pipe, sat down, and leisurely smoked his pipe.

In the courtyard, it was quiet, without any human voice. Behind and in front of the house, there was a bamboo forest. Footsteps sounded on the distant ridges. Closer, closer, he raised his head, the bamboo leaves trembled, as if a gust of wind, rustling, rustling—was it people—were they people being chased?

Ah! A head of blood! People with injuries!

"You you you—"

"Old sir! Quick! Quick! Please let us hide! The Japanese soldiers are coming from behind!"

There were two people in total, both with injuries! Seeing the pistols on their bodies, Old Baldy knew they were guerrillas. He immediately agreed, "Okay, okay." As a result, the two wounded people were hidden in the haystack.

After the silence, the disturbance stirred, wriggling in Quanfuzhen.

The sound of horses' hooves, curses, whips, pleas, and weeping...

Search, search, house-to-house search, it was Old Baldy's turn. Old Baldy shook his head, pretending to be foolish.

"Those two guerrillas who came to your village, hand them over quickly! If you don't tell us, they will beat you to death!"

The "translator" told the old man. Old Baldy shook his head and said nothing.

A junior officer jumped down from his horse and forcefully knocked Old Baldy's bald head with the butt of his gun. Old Baldy's eyes widened; he could not bear it.

"Damn it, who has ever hit me? You son of a bitch! You're taking advantage of me! Let's fight!"

He returned a punch to the officer, breaking his glasses. The officer was furious and shouting. Old Baldy was immediately tied up, his hands tied behind him to a tree.

"This bastard must be hiding them. Just ask him and we'll find the guerrillas."

The officer nodded. Old Baldy's clothes were stripped off.

Whipping, whipping, the skin on his arms turned purple and swollen. Whipping, whipping, blood dripped down. Warm, bright red...

"Hand over the guerrillas and we'll spare your life."

Old Baldy gritted his teeth, prepared to endure all punishment.

A bayonet stabbed into his palm, so painful he could not bear it; he shed tears.

The blood on the ground turned purple, his hands were covered in blood. He remained stubborn.

"Wouldn't it be better to hand over those two people? Save yourself some suffering."

The "translator" advised him with compassion. But Old Baldy was not happy to hear it. He shook his swollen head, looked up proudly, opened his mouth, and smiled bitterly.

"What is this! Am I afraid? Humph! You can kill me, with knives, with guns, whatever. Want me to confess, dream on!"

At this moment, Little Baldy slipped out of the haystack and knelt in front of Old Baldy.

"Tell them! Just hand over the people... If you don't say it, your life... Wuwu... your life... Wuwuwu... Wua..."

Ah! The naked body, the mess of blood and flesh, the wounds from the whipping; that was his poor father! He cried, his heart ached. He wanted his father to confess, because only by confessing could he avoid punishment.

But Old Baldy would not listen to any of this, and kicked Little Baldy away.

"Be a good son and avenge me. Work hard and be a man! Your father is old, death is the time! Get back!"

This was Old Baldy's voice.

It was passing on,—the joy of victory dispelling the spasm of pain.

### "Peace-loving person"'s Outing

### Mulan Joins the Army

— Zou Xiao

—National Novel Notes

The story of Mulan, the earliest record of the battle of course is "Mulan Poem", see Yuefu Poems, Volume 25. Regarding the era of this poem, there were many disputes, ten years ago Xu Zhongshu and others had some lively discussions in the Oriental Magazine, and until the year before last, Qu Ying Sheng continued to study it. Xu Zhongshu determined that Mulan poem was a work between the early Tang and the flourishing Tang Dynasties, and Yao Darong believed that it should belong to the late Sui and early Tang Dynasties; these two theories are the same as the later novels.

Next is the continued poem by Wei Yuanfu of the Tang Dynasty, Yuefu Poems said: "Wei Yuanfu, Zhejiang West Road Inspector and Imperial Censor Zhongyong, continued to add it." There is a warning sentence: "Relatives hold wine to congratulate parents, and then they know that giving birth to daughters is the same as sons."

After this, there should be many poems about Mulan, but in terms of drama, it seems that it was not until the Ming Dynasty that Xu Wenchang wrote a kind of Zaju "Female Mulan", which was mostly based on the original poem, with very few imaginative elements.

It was not until the early Qing Dynasty that Chu Renhuo's "Sui Tang Romance" interspersed a section of Mulan, the fifty-sixth episode was "Mulan Filial Son on Behalf of Joining the Army", and the fifty-ninth episode was "The Wonderful Woman Fengge Zhane". Another sister, Hua Youlan, was added, and she fell in love with Luo Cheng. It was written quite beautifully, and it seemed more successful than Hua Mulan.

It was not until the nineteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty that Pinwentang published "The Biography of a Loyal, Filial, Brave and Heroic Woman" in four volumes and thirty-two episodes, which is what this article is about, "Mulan Joins the Army". "Mulan Joins the Army" is the book title changed by the workshop. This book is a mixture of vernacular and classical Chinese, and the story is purely fabricated. It calls Mulan Poem a work by Li Jing, and it also mixes a lot of Taoist immortals, which is extremely ridiculous. In the middle, it intersperses with the events of Han Qin Hu, Shi Jian De, Wei Chi Gong, Chu Suiliang, etc. during the Sui and Tang Dynasties. It was not until the eighth episode that Zhu Mulan was born. According to the original preface of Xiu Qingshi, it is based on "Later Tang Shu". I have not seen this book; but after checking the new and old Tang books, there is neither Mulan nor Zhu Mulan. It is mostly that the author fabricated the story at will, and then fabricated the book title to make himself important, right?

In the late Qing Dynasty, Liu Shenshu (author of History of Medieval Literature) made the Luantan "Mulan Joins the Army". Recently, "Idle Book" magazine has republished it once, adding a clown as Mulan's cousin, who is afraid of fighting, so Mulan steps forward willingly, deliberately using cowardice to set off bravery. The singing is very good; but it is too elegant, and it does not seem to be understood by ordinary people, and because of lack of experience, the sentences are mostly awkward and difficult to pronounce, which is not as good as the one performed by Mei Lanfang.

Mei Lanfang's "Mulan Joins the Army" is included in the 29th volume of Xikao. According to the catalog of the library of the Peking National Drama Society, page 22, this play was written by Qi Rushan. It is almost entirely based on the original Mulan Poem, and the lead-in and exit poems even cleverly quote the original sentence. For example, Mulan said: "Ten thousand miles to the war, the pass is like flying. The northern air invades the double temples, and the cold light shines on the iron clothes." Only three words were changed. He also said: "Return to see the Son of Heaven, the Son of Heaven sits in the Mingtang." Mulan's brother said: "Sharpen the knife Huo Huo to pigs and sheep." There are also many warning sentences, such as Mulan's mother preventing her husband Hua Hu from joining the army, Hua Hu said: "I want to be a soldier, it is everyone's duty. If everyone has a fear of death and only seeks comfort, and does not save the country, what is the use of this people to the country! Although I am old, I ask myself that I can still fight one battle, even if I die on the battlefield, I will leave a good example for the sons, what is there to fear?" Later, Mulan's mother stopped Mulan again, and Mulan also said: "I want to share the worries for the country, men and women are the same. If in a country, everything has to rely on men, wouldn't women be useless? Besides, according to history, in ancient and modern times, there were many women who led troops to kill thieves." Finally, she also said: "If a woman is willing to make up her mind, she is the same as a man."

Yes, women are the same as men. Recently, haven't there been women joining the army in Guangxi and Shaanxi? Writers such as Xie Bingying, Hu Lanqi, Hu Ping, Li Mingjian, etc., are they not also entering and leaving the battlefield and writing reportage literature?

### I Can't Help But Think

— Leng Yan

Reading Mr. Lu Gong's great work "It's Best If You Don't Think" in the January 25th issue of this publication, although he said later: "Go forward, I advise you, there is a new world ahead," meaning that we should work hard to resist the war and not be attached to our hometown, it is very easy to cause misunderstandings, so I wrote another poem to supplement it.

You tell me it's best not to think,

This will only disappoint you.

Friend, beautiful hometown,

No matter what, I can't help but think.

Although it has been destroyed by the enemy and turned into a graveyard,

Needle awns knee-deep grow in the fields,

That old house of more than ten years,

Only a few pillars are left, tilting east and west,

However, I will never give it to the enemy to enjoy in vain.

Listen, the song of "Fight Back to Our Hometown,"

Sings loudly,

Everyone is of one mind and one heart,

Working hard to restore our hometown.

We want to make the Qingbai flag,

Fly freely in our hometown;

We want to bury the seeds of the new China,

To be developed and grow in our hometown;

We want to eliminate the stains left by the enemy,

Make our hometown bright again!

Friends, work hard,

Everyone's blood is surging,

We never want to willingly dream of being slaves without a country.

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

Seven. Change

It has always been said that "good times don't last," and everyone regards Heguo Town as a paradise, but they don't know that there is no paradise in the world, let alone in the period of full-scale war, everything is related to the war. It is undoubtedly impossible to get out of the situation and be carefree.

Heguo Town's position as a paradise has gradually been affected by external influences and can no longer be maintained. This external influence is not the Japanese army, but a bandit team. Originally, the troops led by Regiment Commander Ye were less than two battalions. Although the outposts were placed far away, they could not completely control all the villages and towns. Therefore, in places where he could not reach, bandits took the opportunity to rise up. These bandits also impersonated the names of some teams. The most powerful of these appeared in Shaoxi Town, southeast of Heguo Town. The leader was called Li Xiaomao. Everyone called him One-Eyed Li because he was blind in one eye.

One-Eyed Li was originally a salt smuggler. After becoming the leader of the second phase, he did all kinds of evil, extorting people everywhere, making the general honest people suffer and be miserable. On the one hand, he also secretly communicated with the enemy, setting up donation cards in his sphere of influence, collecting landing donations and transit taxes on various goods, and establishing a rental office, regardless of whether the tenants were able to pay, each stone of rent had to collect 1.3 yuan of mu donation. In addition, such as exclusively selling opium, morphine and other drugs, and sheltering tax-paying casinos, were even more important sources of income. However, although he was lawless, he did not dare to easily commit Heguo Town, because he knew that the regular guerrillas led by Regiment Commander Ye were very strong, far from being able to compete with him.

Regiment Commander Ye had also heard about the various misdeeds of One-Eyed Li from time to time. However, on the one hand, he held the principle of "Chinese people not fighting Chinese people," and on the other hand, he hoped that they could repent and reform. It was also a way to preserve the strength of the country. Thirdly, he was afraid that if he pushed them too hard, they would surrender to the enemy and become accomplices. Therefore, he always endured and did not send out troops. Helplessly, the people within the sphere of influence of One-Eyed Li were really unable to bear the pain, and they came to Regiment Commander Ye to complain one after another. The accusations came like snowflakes. Regiment Commander Ye could not sit idly by, so he convened an emergency military meeting in the township office to discuss how to deal with this group of lawless bandits.

Except for the two battalion commanders who were stationed outside and did not attend, everyone else was there. Regiment Commander Ye roughly reported the various crimes of One-Eyed Li at the meeting, and then began to solicit everyone's opinions. (22)

### On Laughter in Kunqu Opera (Part 1)

— Master Ma Hongxiangyuan

Laughter in Kunqu Opera varies according to the different plots. If the research is not good, or it is against the plot, even if there is good singing and acting, it will be buried. Its relationship with the art in the play is very great. one

Since the relationship between laughter and the plot is like this, practitioners must conduct in-depth research, and even need to have wisdom, add understanding and speculation. In terms of amateur circles, there are very few good laughter. Because they occasionally use skits for entertainment, they learn to laugh for no reason, similar to madness. So they all abandon and do not learn, and their skills are naturally not as good as the performers. The research method of laughter can be divided into three, which are divided into categories according to the plot. A few examples are listed below:

I. Classification

Happy Laughter Category: Smile, hearty laughter, crazy laughter, coy laughter

Non-Happy Laughter Category: Mocking laughter, angry laughter, miserable laughter, sick laughter, pretended laughter

(Smile) Such as Zhou Yu in the Hotel. . "I'm happy to have a place to stay today" (Student)

(Hearty laughter) Such as Zhou Yu said in the previous play when he said "Really, really".

(Crazy laughter) such as Xiaosheng when Emperor Ming appeared in the Xu Pavilion, and also when the Tian family in Shuocin heard Cangtou said "If you want to marry a wife, you must be as beautiful as the lady." (Dan) (Crazy laughter can also be said to be wanton laughter)

(Coy laughter) such as Hongniang making Zhang Sheng see Yingying in Jiaqi (post-dan), and also in Changting and Naoxue, there are many coy laughter of the post, which mostly describes the sensible little maid.

(Mocking laughter) such as King Yi laughing loudly when he saw the white wolf in the Chess Game (Net), probably mocking the state of Chu for using monkeys as prime ministers.

(Angry laughter) such as Cheng Chun said in Dache "What a Marquis of Ten Thousand Households!" (Student) (Miserable laughter and sick laughter) such as Cui Shi in the Dream, as for the laughter when approaching the court, it is already the accumulation of loss of hope and shame in the heart, which will become crazy, so it is sick laughter, which is different from ordinary laughter.

(Pretended laughter) Such as Wang Yun in the Little Banquet, when he heard Lu Bu change his name to Father-in-law, he laughed loudly, but it was actually a pretended laughter.

The above is divided into nine types, and it is inevitable that there will be omissions, but divided by Sheng Dan Jing and other colors, there are dozens of types, which may actually be applied.

2. Voice

All Sheng's smiles, if there is a sound, it is extremely low and slow, Dan is silent, ugly can be used at will, but it must be with a few glib taste.

(Hearty laughter) Sheng made "Hahahaha", the length ratio of each sound is 3:2:1. The ratio of each size is also the same, which is slightly similar in laughter, and must be light in releasing thin air.

### Chatting about Chen Yunshang

— Nie Ge from Hong Kong

Southern actress Chen Yunshang was hired by Shanghai Xinhua Company to star in the costume film "Mulan Joins the Army", which aroused the attention of people in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Now let us introduce this lucky star to the readers, so that readers can have a clear impression and understanding of her.

Chen Yunshang rose to prominence in the South China film industry last year, but she has only been engaged in the film industry for two and a half years. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, she came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou and began to enter the film industry. The first person to recognize her was the red director Su Yi in Hong Kong. Su was preparing the film "New Youth" and lacked a female lead, so he boldly chose her to play the role. The female lead was "an innocent country girl", and she was successful in the film. Then, she starred in "The Twelve Hairpins of the Golden House" in two episodes and "Flowers Bloom Wealth" under the direction of Tang Xiaodan of Daguan Company (formerly a set designer of Shanghai Tianyi Company and now also a Hong Kong red director), so her reputation grew day by day. Last year, after starring in "Blood Splash Baoshan City" directed by Situ Huimin, she jumped to the position of first-class red star.

She is relatively close to Qu Ran, a director who is also very prominent in Hong Kong. Since she starred in "The World is for the Public" under the direction of Director Qu, the two have been inseparable. This can be said with a recent incident. After Chen went to Shanghai, her car is now driven by Mr. Qu every day. Newspapers have published many "glamorous news" about them in the past, but they neither recognize it nor admit it.

As the star's status rises, so does the frame. When Chen Yunshang was filming in various companies in Hong Kong, in addition to her mother accompanying her every step of the way, there were also two "nannies" following her to serve her, one carrying food, clothing, and cosmetics, and the other specializing in pouring tea and handing towels. Busy non-stop. When it was hot, they would fan her behind her back, so proud and pretentious that it made people feel that she was too contrived, although she was very polite to deal with ordinary people.

Chen Yunshang's real name is Chen Minqiang. In Guangzhou, she has already starred in "Crushing Gusu Terrace" and "Tang Palace Dream", two historical costume films, in which she played the Empress of Yue and "Yang Guifei".

Before filming in Guangzhou, she was a member of the Guangzhou Song and Dance Troupe, when she was only thirteen years old. She often performed on stage at the Sincere Amusement Park and the Daxin Amusement Park. Later, she joined the "Sushu" of an art research association, learning Peking and Cantonese opera, and laid the foundation for today's fame.

### Prospects for Old Opera (4)

— Yu Tang

Comparing old opera to an antique seems most appropriate. Ancient pottery, when first made, was originally everyday utensils such as bottles, bowls, and jars. After being buried for thousands of years, once unearthed and in the hands of modern people, some use it to recall the lives of ancient people; some study the quality of its material, color, and pattern; some dust it off morning and night, treating it like a precious jade; or send it to a museum for careful preservation. No one uses it as a container anymore. The situation of old opera is similar: initially, the plays were written and performed mostly with good intentions of promoting good and suppressing evil, and of cyclical karmic retribution, to influence the audience. Later, repeated performances and ever-changing actors led to varied effects. For example, actor A performs best, actor B is slightly worse, and actor C performs poorly. Or, one actor is a living Zhuge Liang, and another is a living Cao Cao or Zhang Fei. This situation escalated, causing the nature of old opera to naturally shift from an art of life to an art for art's sake, far removed from the original purpose of creating and performing plays. Today, those who sit solemnly in the audience, watching the play and shedding tears, are ridiculed as fools worrying about ancient people. On the contrary, those who focus on the actors' eyes and gestures, or close their eyes in concentration, distinguishing the sharp, round, yin, and yang sounds, and the ups and downs of the melodies, are considered true appreciators of old opera. From this evolution, we can see that old opera focuses on technique, while the plot and consciousness have retreated to an insignificant position. No matter how absurd the plot of a play is, as long as the actors perform and sing well, the play can be called a masterpiece and have a large audience. In the past, weren't there many neglected and unpopular plays that were made popular by Tan Xinpei and others? Similarly, a script with a very progressive consciousness will not have a good effect if performed by inferior actors, it can be asserted. For example, the play "A Remnant of the Late Ming Dynasty" has a good script, and Zhou Xinfang's performance is quite moving. His disciples' performances are slightly less effective. An inferior actor's performance is simply not worth watching, let alone discussing the effect. Mr. Tao Zaidong's discussion of the play "Catching and Releasing Cao" is that it is very inappropriate, with insightful opinions. However, the play "Catching and Releasing Cao" was made popular by Tan Xinpei, and his every note, word, gesture, and step have become the typical model for today's actors. If one learns to imitate it well, it is considered correct; if one does not, it is considered incorrect. Not only do the actors not dare to make changes lightly, but even amateur performers who consider themselves to be more knowledgeable than the actors are bound by the ropes of acting techniques and do not have the courage to revise it. Regarding this point, several examples can be cited: small plays like "Eighteen Twists," "Little Cowherd," and "Little Grave Visit" have no consciousness to speak of at all, and an inferior actor's performance makes people drowsy; but if performed by a skilled Hua Dan and clown, it can be watched endlessly.

### Anecdotes - The True and False Yang Xiaolou

— Shiwuxuan

Mei Lanfang decided to go to Nantong for the second time, accompanied by Yang Xiaolou. At that time, the Nantong market was not as prosperous as when Lanfang first came to Nantong. However, Zhang Jian's treatment of Lanfang could be described as extremely generous. In the east garden of the Haonan Villa, there were several buildings called Huazhu Ping'an Hall, which were located near the Hao River and faced the museum, with elegant scenery. Zhang specially designated them as Lanfang's residence, while Xiaolou was accommodated in the house of the actor Zha. Xiaolou was unhappy with the different treatment. When performing at the Gengsu Theatre, the people of Nantong, eager to see Xiaolou's reputation, flocked to watch. However, Xiaolou was a northern Wusheng, and his style was different from that of the southern school. The people of Nantong did not initially recognize the beauty of the northern school. In addition, Xiaolou was unmotivated and unwilling to exert himself, resulting in a scattered and uninspired performance. As a result, the people of Nantong echoed each other, saying that it was a fake Yang Xiaolou. This was overheard by Zhang Jian, who said to Lanfang one day, "There is a sentence in the couplet I wrote for the Gengsu Theatre, 'What is true is still false, why must the false be untrue.' I never thought it would be a eulogy for Xiaolou today."

### Hardworking "Tianxin"

— Xu Yanfang

Her debut work "Tianxin" will be performed soon

Tianxin, originally named Zhang Nanzi, worked for the Jiangning County Government in 1929, and for the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau and Public Security Bureau in 1930. Later, she married Mr. Ma Er (Feng Shuluan). When the war broke out, Feng suddenly betrayed the country. Tianxin, in great pain and hatred, eventually left him. She briefly joined the Great China Drama Troupe organized by Yun Ziqian, initially as a guest performer. Unexpectedly, she achieved great success in "Thunderstorm" (Tianxin played Fanyi), and then became a formal performer. Later, the entire Great China troupe went to the Green Isle, and Tianxin also became the lead actress, rivaling Fan Xuepeng for a time. Recently, in addition to acting, Tianxin has set aside all meaningless social engagements and immersed herself in writing scripts. Her debut work is named "Tianxin," and she is currently working on writing the dialogue. Because she has a solid foundation, success is expected. Soon, when "Tianxin" is performed on stage, it will definitely cause a sensation.

### Secret History of the Imperial Court and the Pear Garden of the Old Capital (27)

— Xu Muyun

Eating from the opera profession is not an easy task, especially in the Pear Garden circles of the old capital. Since the establishment of the Jingzhong Temple, positions such as the temple chief and the president of the Pear Garden Guild had great authority in controlling all affairs within the guild. In the prosperous era of opera schools, all students who completed their studies and graduated were essentially granted a diploma. They could perform anywhere with great prestige. Therefore, actors who came from opera schools did not need to go through the ritual of apprenticeship.

If an outsider wanted to join the opera profession, it was an extremely difficult and exclusionary matter. It was difficult to break in easily. Even if you could scheme and ask someone to introduce you to someone and kowtow to them, you would be considered to have entered this threshold. But if your respected teacher did not have great fame or, despite having fame, was unwilling to help you, you would not be able to thrive in the opera troupe.

Ten years ago, when I was making recordings in Beiping, Mr. Woyun Jushi and Mr. Dong Junfeng introduced me to an amateur actor who sang Xiaohualian named Wang Huaifu. They praised his voice as excellent and his recitations as crisp. He could imitate the styles of Xiaolou, Huang San, Sun Juxian, Zhu Suyun, and others in the "Picking Up Gold" play so perfectly that the imitation was virtually indistinguishable from the original when recorded. When I discussed this with the engineers, I realized that their Western mindset was that they would not accept anyone without a reputation. As the end of the year approached, Wang also asked Mr. Rong Zhifeng to plead with me to help a poor friend, even if it meant recording two or three sides for 300 yuan. Later, I said to the foreigner, "I will advance this 100 yuan. If it cannot be sold after recording, I will compensate for the loss of the wax disc." After this discussion, Wang's "Picking Up Gold" was finally recorded on three sides. Unexpectedly, it sold very well. People bought three copies at a time, and these few sides were the most profitable at the end of the year. That was because the royalty fee was 33 yuan per side, which was far different from Dr. Mei's price of 1,500 yuan per side. At that time, I finally helped the frustrated Wang vent his frustration.
