(Chongqing) Due to inclement weather and poor visibility tonight, the Japanese aircraft's attempt to bomb Chongqing was unsuccessful. However, on their way back to their base, the Japanese aircraft bombed Wanxian, downstream from Chongqing. It is said that 36 Japanese bombers took off from Hankou in two batches this morning and evening, heading up the river towards Chongqing. The first batch consisted of nine planes, and the second batch consisted of seventeen planes. Shortly after 6:00 PM, the Japanese aircraft were spotted crossing the Hubei-Sichuan border. When the first batch of Japanese planes reached a certain place 200 kilometers from Chongqing, the air raid alarm was sounded, and Chinese fighter planes immediately took off to patrol the skies over Chongqing, appearing and disappearing in the thick clouds, preparing to intercept the Japanese aircraft. Subsequently, because the Japanese aircraft bombed Wanxian, they flew back, so the alert was lifted at 8:00 PM (Reuters Telegraph, 7th).

Guangzhou: Following the disagreement between the British and Japanese authorities regarding the memorandum signed by the Japanese side, which stipulated the passage of British and Japanese ships on the Pearl River, the Japanese ships leased by the Japanese government, originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong this morning, have now been diverted from Guangzhou to Macau. According to well-informed sources, the Japanese side intends to have merchant ships operate twice a week between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, while only allowing British ships to operate once every two weeks. This is one of the reasons for the divergence of views between the two sides. A Portuguese ship arrived here from Macau yesterday, the first time since the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou. Portuguese ships are now allowed to operate once a week (Reuters Telegraph, 7th).

(Chongqing) Regarding the news that the bombs used by Japanese aircraft are mostly of inferior quality, it was confirmed today by the French military attaché who recently visited Yichang. According to the attaché, the bombs recently dropped by Japanese aircraft in Yichang were of extremely poor quality. Furthermore, according to many foreigners who personally witnessed it, most of the bombs recently dropped by Japanese aircraft in the interior failed to explode. This is very different from the bombs used by Japanese aircraft before the fall of Wuhan. Before the fall of Wuhan, the bombs used by Japanese aircraft were mostly produced in Germany and Italy, and their explosive power was extremely strong. However, since the fall of Wuhan, the bombs used by the Japanese side have mostly lacked explosive power. For example, in the recent bombing of Chongqing by Japanese aircraft, it is estimated that as many as 15 of the bombs dropped failed to explode. It is believed that these bombs are mostly produced by Japan itself (Associated Press Telegraph, 7th).

He said that the local Japanese authorities are continuing to investigate to determine the extent to which the British officers sought Japanese military secrets and whether they had passed on the information they obtained to the Chinese side. Although British personnel, even Ambassador Clark Kerr, always notified the Japanese side in advance when they wanted to pass through areas occupied by the Japanese army, the Ambassador's entourage did not notify in advance and did not obtain passports issued by the Japanese army, yet they entered and exited areas where Chinese and Japanese troops were engaged in combat.

社評上海市塲的新變動
Editorial: New Changes in the Shanghai Market

　　上海的外匯市塲，自從國民政府的外匯平衡基金成立以後，便自飄忽動盪的局面，轉入穩定的狀態，匯豐銀行底掛牌，維持着英匯八便士，和美匯十五元六二五的價格，暗盤的賣價，英匯站住在八便士二五的關口，美匯也不脫十六元零六二五的軸心。直至昨晨，也還是風平浪靜。堅守掛牌原盤；暗盤的開盤，也是前天的原價，英匯八便士二五和美匯十六元零九三七五；聽說買賣的數量，也可觀得很。誰知僅隔一小時，傳來了上海方面暫停供給外匯的消息，市塲上便激起空前的波瀾；外滙的滙價暴落，標金的暗盤，掀起驚人的漲風，從開盤二千零九十八元，步漲到最高峯二千二百五十六元；棉紗也受了影響，也給投機家抬價拉提，市氣極度的活動。從十一時起，匯豐的掛牌，也减縮了；英滙縮到七便士七五，美滙縮到十五元一二五的新價。暗盤的行市更低，到中午收盤，英滙的賣價只有七便士二五，買價是七便士半；美滙的賣價十四元一二五，買價是十四元一二五，都跌破過去低價的紀錄。
Since the establishment of the National Government's foreign exchange stabilization fund, the Shanghai foreign exchange market has transitioned from a fluctuating and turbulent situation to a stable one. HSBC's listed exchange rate maintained a price of eight pence for British pounds and 15.625 yuan for US dollars. In the black market, the selling price for British pounds stood at 8.25 pence, and the US dollar remained around the core of 16.0625 yuan. Until yesterday morning, everything was still calm. The original listed rates were adhered to, and the black market opened at the previous day's prices: 8.25 pence for British pounds and 16.09375 yuan for US dollars. The trading volume was also reportedly quite considerable. Who would have known that only an hour later, news came that Shanghai had temporarily suspended the supply of foreign exchange, causing unprecedented waves in the market. The exchange rate of foreign exchange plummeted, and the black market for gold skyrocketed, rising from an opening price of 2,098 yuan to a peak of 2,256 yuan. Cotton yarn was also affected and speculators drove up the price, causing extreme activity in the market. From 11:00 AM onwards, HSBC's listed rates were also reduced, with British pounds dropping to 7.75 pence and US dollars to a new price of 15.125 yuan. Black market rates were even lower, with the selling price of British pounds only 7.25 pence and the buying price 7.5 pence at noon closing; the selling price of US dollars was 14.125 yuan and the buying price was 14.125 yuan, all breaking past record lows.

　　昨夜路透社香港電，傳達負責人的宣示，據稱法幣基礎充實，根本絕無問題；這當然是極重要的好消息，足以鎭定匯市的不安。至於這决的停止供給上海外匯，至記者握管之時爲止，尙未獲悉負責方面對於本問題的說明，亦未接到他方面更詳盡的報告；故問題的內容與性質，尙難十分明瞭。但是上海外滙的停止供給，早就是意想中的事。自從中國軍隊西撒之後，上海有孤島之喩，這以中國爲主體而言之。眞是確切不移；但從另一觀點言之，上海成爲「國際的特別區域」了。國民政府對此國際特區，供給外滙，維持上海的外滙市塲，雖然我們應該理解這是一番苦心孤詣，這是表示並不棄之如遺；但是從最精明的經濟觀點言之，這種供給維持本來不是必須的措施。過去供給維持了一年有餘，消耗了多少的外滙？付出了多少的代價？這眞是驚人的鉅數啊！但是就國民政府言之，就抗戰言之，代價的收穫却是什麽？却在那裏？當然，中國的商民受惠不淺，同時也嘉惠於日本；因爲日本方面也得到了很大的便利，來儘量套取外滙。換句話說，便是「以中國的法幣，資助了日本的侵略」說起來眞是矛盾得很。這决能夠及時補苴，可以說是「亡羊補牢，猶爲未晚」，因爲「華興銀行」的成立，還不滿一個月，「華興票」的發行數也只有幾十萬元。它們的標榜，以法幣爲準備；它們的手法，以法幣爲掩護；它們的目標，還是換取作戰所必需的外匯；現在却如關上大門直接根絕了外匯的隙漏，間接保衛了法幣的基礎，防止抗戰力量的削弱。所以我們應該理解：這决停止供給上海外滙，對中國法幣，對上海市面有其相反的影響；是壯士斷腕的精神，是延年益壽的妙方。
Last night, Reuters Hong Kong reported a statement from a person in charge, claiming that the basis of the legal tender (fabi) was solid and there were no fundamental problems. This was certainly very important good news, enough to calm the unease in the foreign exchange market. As for the decision to stop supplying foreign exchange to Shanghai, as of the time the reporter was writing, no explanation had been received from the responsible parties regarding this issue, nor had more detailed reports been received from other sources; therefore, the content and nature of the issue were still not very clear. However, the suspension of foreign exchange supply to Shanghai was already something expected. Since the retreat of Chinese troops westward, Shanghai has been likened to an isolated island, which is accurate from the perspective of China as a whole. But from another perspective, Shanghai has become an "international special area." Although we should understand that the National Government's supply of foreign exchange to this international special area to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange market was done with great care and effort, indicating that it was not being abandoned, from the most shrewd economic point of view, this kind of supply and maintenance was not a necessary measure. Over the past year or so, how much foreign exchange has been consumed? How much has been paid? It's a truly astonishing amount! But what has been gained for the National Government, for the War of Resistance, in return for that price? Where is it? Of course, Chinese merchants have benefited a lot, and at the same time, it has benefited Japan, because the Japanese side has also obtained great convenience in extracting as much foreign exchange as possible. In other words, it is "using Chinese legal tender to subsidize Japanese aggression," which is very contradictory. This decision to take remedial action in time can be said to be "better late than never," because the establishment of the "Huaxing Bank" is less than a month old, and the number of "Huaxing notes" issued is only a few hundred thousand yuan. They claim to be backed by legal tender; their method is to use legal tender as a cover; their goal is still to exchange for foreign exchange necessary for combat. Now, it's like closing the door and directly eliminating the leak of foreign exchange, indirectly defending the foundation of the legal tender, and preventing the weakening of the War of Resistance. Therefore, we should understand that this decision to stop the supply of foreign exchange to Shanghai has the opposite effect on Chinese legal tender and the Shanghai market; it is the spirit of a brave man cutting off his wrist, it is a wonderful prescription for prolonging life.

　　我們要是求全責備，我們以爲這决處理的方式與時機，不是最妥善；假定此類金融措置，在星期六下午，或星期日實行，則市塲上所受的影響，雖然一樣，可是一書夜的隔絕，减弱了投機的毒氛，民間的激刺，也不至於過度的緊張；而現在則以外滙暗盤的猛縮，標金暗盤的在漲增加了市塲的不安定。雖說這是由於進口商的恐慌，和投機家的作俑，造成了這樣的局面，但若在開盤時直接公表，比較上更妥當一些。這中間的利害得失，原來複雜之極，不容輕下斷語；但鑒於昨天的情形，我們不能不想像到時機的不是最好。
If we were to demand perfection, we would think that the manner and timing of this decision were not the most appropriate. If such financial measures were implemented on Saturday afternoon or Sunday, the impact on the market would be the same, but the isolation of one night would weaken the atmosphere of speculation, and the stimulation of the people would not be so excessively tense. As it is, the sharp contraction of the foreign exchange black market and the rise of the gold black market have increased the instability of the market. Although it is said that this situation was caused by the panic of importers and the machinations of speculators, it would have been more appropriate to announce it directly at the opening of the market. The advantages and disadvantages in this are extremely complex and cannot be easily judged; but in light of yesterday's situation, we cannot help but imagine that the timing was not the best.

　　此外，我們順便對於國民政府的「平衡」方法，略述管見：原來實行外滙的統制到現在，已經十五個月了，過去的市傷調度，都假手由外商辦理，供給外滙，都由滙豐經手；這當然有不得已的苦衷。不過觀察一年來的經過，似乎太覺得單調；就近三個月以來說，上海的外滙動向，全看着香港的供求，香港繼續供給，便能維持原價，萬一有意買回，便激起外匯的跌風。在此方式之下，很難適應平衡政策的需要；至少也可以說，很難收得平衡政策最大的效果。所以平衡的原則雖無可批評，但外匯平衡基金運用的技巧，還得盡量改善，以後新辦法怎樣，我們可以不問，運用的方法，便該放棄這種「一條鞭」的策略，務必因時因地制宜，才可應付方來的幻變。
In addition, we would like to briefly describe our humble views on the National Government's "balancing" method. It has been 15 months since the implementation of foreign exchange controls. In the past, the market scheduling was all handled by foreign merchants, and the supply of foreign exchange was handled by HSBC. Of course, there were compelling reasons for this. However, observing the past year, it seems too monotonous. In the past three months, the movement of foreign exchange in Shanghai has depended entirely on the supply and demand in Hong Kong. If Hong Kong continues to supply, the original price can be maintained, but if there is an intention to buy back, it will trigger a decline in foreign exchange. Under this method, it is difficult to adapt to the needs of the balancing policy; at least it can be said that it is difficult to achieve the greatest effect of the balancing policy. Therefore, although the principle of balance is not open to criticism, the skills of using the foreign exchange stabilization fund must be improved as much as possible. We can not ask what the new method will be in the future, but the method of use should abandon this "one-size-fits-all" strategy and adapt to the time and place in order to cope with the changes that are coming.

The Sacrifice in the Lun Chang Labor Strike: British Officer Dies of Severe Wounds; Ding Geller Wounded and Captured by Japanese Troops; Died This Morning After Ineffective Treatment in Shanghai; British Consulate Will Lodge Strong Protest.

The British-owned Lun Chang Textile Mill, located in Lujiazui, Pudong, is one of the most important British enterprises in Shanghai. Late last month, a small number of workers, instigated by others, failed to work as usual. Unexpectedly, a group of workers attempted to return to work the day before yesterday morning but were stopped by unstable elements, resulting in a brawl. Ding Geller, a British officer of the mill, was stabbed by Japanese military police and died yesterday morning. The British Consulate attaches great importance to this incident and will lodge a reasoned protest. Details are as follows:

Obstruction of Work Resumption Leads to Conflict

Since the labor strike was triggered by the dismissal of worker Gu Jinsheng on the 20th of last month, unstable elements seized the opportunity to instigate and distribute "relief funds" to entice workers, attempting to incite an "anti-British" movement. Most workers understood the situation and were unwilling to be exploited. Therefore, they voluntarily returned to work on the 29th, but were blocked by the so-called "Strike Committee," causing complications. The factory then published a notice, requesting workers to elect representatives to negotiate directly with the company on the morning of the 5th, but this was also threatened and prevented by the "Strike Committee," leading to a complete deadlock in the labor unrest. The day before yesterday morning, a group of loyal workers crossed the Huangpu River to return to work. Upon hearing this, the "Workers' Alliance" sent dozens of thugs to intercept them halfway in Lujiazui, resulting in a conflict. The Japanese military police, citing the maintenance of public order, arrested the returning workers. Ding Geller, a British officer of the Lun Chang Mill, was also stabbed in the chaos and taken away by the Japanese army.

Arrested Briton Dies of Severe Wounds

However, according to the Japanese side, the arrested British man was apprehended because he used a pistol to threaten Japanese marines. After learning about the incident, the British Consulate immediately protested to the Japanese Consulate. Upon learning that Ding Geller was seriously injured, they consulted with the Japanese Consulate and visited the Japanese military authorities in Pudong. Mr. Ding was escorted to Shanghai and sent to Hongkou Public Hospital for treatment at 11 p.m. on the 6th. Two Japanese military doctors and a German surgeon performed emergency surgery. The British man had a gun butt wound on his head, and three stab wounds on his abdomen and legs, with the abdominal wound being the most severe. The doctors' efforts were ineffective, and he died of his injuries at 4:50 a.m. yesterday morning. Mr. Ding was 45 years old. The tragic death was mourned by all who heard of it.

British Consul-General Pays Serious Attention

Since the Lun Chang labor unrest occurred, and someone took the opportunity to engage in political incitement, the British side has been extremely indignant. Unexpectedly, Ding Geller was detained the day before yesterday and died of his injuries. The company authorities have reported the details to the British Consulate-General for investigation. It is reported that British Consul-General Philip attaches great importance to this incident and is currently investigating the facts to lodge a reasoned protest with the Japanese side. However, until the case is clarified, he is unwilling to make any statement.

Released Only After Severe Injuries

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that officials at the British Consulate are taking the entire Ding Geller incident very seriously this morning (7th). It is expected that a strong protest will be lodged with the Japanese authorities, on the grounds that the Japanese took unnecessarily strong action against Mr. Ding and were at fault for not immediately sending him to Shanghai for first-class medical treatment. Yesterday morning, Mr. Ding seemed to be in a very bad mood during the Lun Chang factory dispute, or even enraged. He was eventually disarmed by Japanese sailors. It is not yet clear whether he was stabbed before or after being disarmed. Mr. Ding was an employee of the Lun Chang Textile Mill in Pudong. He was only brought out by the Japanese army in Pudong last night when his condition became very serious. He underwent surgery at Public Hospital at midnight but died at 5:30 a.m. this morning.

Detained in Pudong and Subjected to Abuse

British Consul-General Philip expressed to the Japanese Consul-General yesterday (6th) that it was regrettable that an unfortunate incident had occurred between the two sides. The manager of the Lun Chang Company also expressed the same sentiment, but clearly stated that Mr. Ding was acting in the company's interest yesterday morning to prevent striking workers from damaging company property. The incident occurred around 8 a.m. yesterday morning. Mr. Ding was subsequently detained by the Japanese army in Pudong and subjected to abuse. Although Mr. Ding had consular jurisdiction, it appeared that the Japanese side intended to detain him yesterday and not hand him over to the British authorities.

British Coroner Inquired This Morning

One of the Japanese doctors who treated Mr. Ding told those who inquired that Mr. Ding's injuries were not serious. However, when two members of the British Consulate went to Pudong last night, Mr. Ding was immediately sent to Shanghai and assisted in every way, as his condition had become serious. German doctor Klein and Norwegian doctor Sanzipek performed surgery together at Public Hospital from midnight until 3 a.m. this morning, knowing that Mr. Ding had little hope of survival because he had been delayed for fifteen hours. He had two abdominal wounds, was seriously injured by kicks, and lost a lot of blood. He died at 5:30 a.m. this morning. British Consulate coroner Haines inquired this morning at the Public Hospital morgue. Mr. Kerwin, an administrator of the Lun Chang Company, formally identified Mr. Ding.

The Mainland News reported on the stabbing and transfer of Mr. Ding from Pudong:

Ding Geller, a British employee of the British-owned textile mill in Lujiazui, Pudong (formerly a police inspector at the Shanghai Municipal Council), had an unfortunate incident with several soldiers of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces in Pudong at around 8 a.m. yesterday (6th). Mr. Ding suffered three stab wounds to the abdomen, one serious head injury, and one stab wound to the right leg. At around 11:40 p.m., he was sent from Pudong to Shanghai by officers and soldiers of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, accompanied by British Vice-Consul Ford and Japanese Consul Utsuyama. He was rushed to Public Hospital by a fire department ambulance and immediately examined. It was found that his injuries were critical, and he was immediately sent to the operating room. As of this morning (7th), emergency surgery was still being performed. The surgeons were two German surgeons and two Japanese naval doctors, assisted by two nurses. Two armed Japanese sentries were stationed outside the operating room, indicating that the Japanese authorities had not yet formally handed over the British officer.

At midnight, Mr. Ding was still on the operating table. At 1:30 a.m. this morning, surgery was still being performed. It was discovered that his intestines had been pierced, and it was expected that he would not survive until this morning. Although British officials did not express their views on the matter last night, it was learned from reliable sources that riots had broken out between striking workers and replacement workers. Japanese naval officers and soldiers intervened to mediate. Mr. Ding threatened these officers and soldiers with a pistol, which led to a Japanese sentry striking him with a rifle butt. When the reporter questioned the British authorities last night, it was stated that a thorough investigation would be conducted into this matter and that there was nothing else to say. However, it was acknowledged that Japanese Consul-General Miura had visited British Consul-General Philip at 5 p.m. yesterday afternoon to lodge a verbal protest regarding Mr. Ding's "intimidation" of Japanese naval officers and sailors with a gun. It was noted that one of the two officers "intimidated" was Major Noji, the commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces in Pudong, who was reportedly "intimidated" by a British sentry from the West Yorkshire Regiment with a gun ten days ago. Earlier, British Vice-Consul Ford heard that Mr. Ding's condition was critical and met with the Japanese Consul-General, accompanied by Japanese Consul Utsuyama, to go to Pudong to meet Major Noji. Then, a speedboat was used to send Mr. Ding to Shanghai. At 10:15 p.m., the Public Concession on the Huangpu River received a phone call from Pudong requesting an ambulance. An hour and a half later, the speedboat arrived at the customs pier. It was originally intended to send the injured person to Hongen Hospital, but it was heard that Mr. Ding's injuries were very critical and that it was not advisable to take him to the hospital over a long distance. At the same time, the Japanese authorities also expressed their hope that the injured person would be sent to a hospital north of the Suzhou Creek. It was not possible to ascertain last night how Mr. Ding's abdomen was stabbed in three places. Japanese sources admitted that after disarming Mr. Ding, a Japanese sailor struck Mr. Ding with a rifle butt to subdue him. But the fact is that Mr. Ding suffered three serious injuries and was detained by the Japanese authorities in Pudong for eight hours and twenty minutes before being sent to Shanghai at around 11 p.m. yesterday.

A Japanese naval spokesman briefly described the incident to reporters last night, stating that at around 7:40 a.m. yesterday morning, forty workers replacing the striking workers arrived at the factory's floating pier. Thirty striking workers in nearby sampans saw them, waved sticks, and boarded the floating pier to fight. Ten Japanese sailors protecting the factory went over the wall to the pier and took everyone to the headquarters. When approaching the Lun Chang factory's office, ten British people walked out, three of whom were carrying pistols. Fifteen striking workers fled to the factory's power room. A Japanese officer led six sailors to pursue them, leaving four sailors in place. At this time, ten British people approached the four sailors. One of them (Ding Geller) tried to snatch a sailor's rifle and fired a shot, then ran towards the power room. Approaching the Japanese officer, he held the officer's right wrist with his left hand and pressed the gun against his chest, ordering him to leave. Upon hearing this, the commander of the Japanese battalion led some soldiers to the factory and was also insulted by a British person (Ding Geller) with a gun. The Japanese sailors considered him a dangerous element and captured him, taking away his gun. Unexpectedly, the British person pounced on the sailors again. Another Japanese sailor then struck him with a rifle butt. He was then taken to the Japanese military headquarters for treatment and protection and detained, the spokesman said. In response to reporters' questions, the spokesman said that there was no indication that Mr. Ding would be handed over to the British side. The most important question raised by reporters was whether the Japanese side would respect Mr. Ding's consular jurisdiction. The spokesman said that this would be considered. When asked whether Mr. Ding would be interrogated by a Japanese military court or handed over to the British authorities for questioning, the spokesman replied that no decision had been made. He was not allowed to meet with anyone today. The workers who fought at the floating pier yesterday morning are also detained at the Japanese Naval Landing Forces headquarters in Pudong. However, there are currently no Japanese soldiers in the Lun Chang factory, the spokesman said. It was not possible to verify from other sources last night the spokesman's claim that Mr. Ding did indeed fire a gun.

London Pays Close Attention

(Reuters, London, 7th) The British government is taking a very serious view of the accidental incident on June 6 in Pudong, where a British employee of the British-owned Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory clashed with Japanese sailors, resulting in the injury and death of British citizen Ding Geller. It is reported that the Japanese side effectively controls the area where the factory is located. Workers at the factory have been causing disturbances for some time. After a protest from the British side, a squad of British naval soldiers was stationed at the factory. However, they withdrew a few days later after receiving a written guarantee from the Japanese side to protect the lives and property of British citizens. British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie lodged this matter with the Japanese Foreign Ministry yesterday, urging attention to the activities of some Japanese instigating the strike and the failure of the Japanese side to take steps to maintain law and order.

(Reuters, Tokyo, 7th) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated today regarding the death of British employee Ding Geller at the Lun Chang Company factory in Pudong that 400 workers, both striking and non-striking, were fighting each other at the time. While Japanese sailors were arresting the ringleaders and taking them to headquarters, Mr. Ding suddenly appeared and fired a gun at the Japanese sailors.

U.S. Fleet Commander Yarnell to North China; Leaves Shanghai on Flagship This Morning; New Commander Hurd Scheduled to Arrive in China

The Mainland News reported yesterday (6th) from reliable sources that U.S. Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell has received orders to return to the United States. His successor, Admiral Hurd, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by ship on July 18. He will immediately take the U.S. ship Isabel to Qingdao to meet Admiral Yarnell. According to current plans, the Isabel will sail from North China to Shanghai to pick up Admiral Hurd and transport him to Qingdao. A ceremony is scheduled to be held on July 25 on the flagship Augusta, which is docked in Qingdao. Admirals Yarnell and Hurd will read orders to the flagship's officers and soldiers. Admiral Hurd will formally accept the position of Commander of the Asiatic Fleet. Then, Admiral Yarnell will return to Shanghai on the Isabel, stay for several days, and then depart for the United States. Admiral Yarnell succeeded Admiral Moffett as Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in the fall of 1936. He has served for three years. He was originally scheduled to return to the United States last year after serving his two-year term, but because of his familiarity with the Chinese situation and Sino-Japanese affairs related to American citizens, his term was extended for one year. In the past two weeks, foreign nationals in Shanghai who were friendly with Admiral Yarnell have been giving him farewell dinners. Admiral Yarnell is scheduled to travel to North China on the flagship Augusta tomorrow (8th). The ship will stop in Qingdao, Yantai, or Qinhuangdao. According to current plans, the ship may remain in North China until late September.

Seventh Installment of Principal and Interest on the Consolidated Public Debt to Be Paid in Full; No Postponement Due to Interception of Customs Revenue; Method of Payment May Be Slightly Restricted

The lottery for the seventh installment of principal repayment on the Class A, B, C, D, and E bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) Consolidated Public Debt has been conducted by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. According to regulations, all principal and interest due will be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications on July 31, 1939. Since the Ministry of Finance issued a notice regarding the variable repayment method for debts secured by salt taxes, no longer allowing overdrafts, and because the consolidated public debt is paid from the tax revenue remaining after paying reparations and foreign debts from customs revenue, the interception of customs revenue in the occupied areas has led to rumors of variable repayment methods. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has decided to find ways to provide advances.

In order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance's decision to find ways to advance funds for the consolidated, reconstruction, and gold long-term debts, even though they are secured by customs revenue, has won the trust of bondholders. Regarding the seventh installment of principal repayment and interest payment on the consolidated public debt, it has been decided to repay in full without postponement due to the interception of customs revenue. The payment method will be announced by the Ministry in due course.

To prevent large amounts of legal tender from flowing into the occupied areas, the above method may be adopted, with full payment in Chongqing and exchange permits issued in Shanghai and other places. The amount of principal and interest payable is listed below:

Class A: 7,852,500 yuan
Class B: 5,715,000 yuan
Class C: 12,985,000 yuan
Class D: 20,040,500 yuan
Class E: 9,646,000 yuan

Total: 56,660,000 yuan

Pay Attention to Preventing the Purchase of Foreign Wheat with Foreign Exchange for Shipment to Japan; Rumors of More Than 20 Million Bags Shipped to Japan in the Past Six Months; Using Legal Tender to Obtain Foreign Exchange and Purchase under False Pretenses

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, various places along the Yangtze River have been automatically abandoned after being heavily consumed by the Japanese side for strategic reasons, resulting in the successive fall of areas known for their abundant agricultural production. The Japanese side has illegally controlled various major products in the interior through its special violence, especially wheat, which has been even more severely plundered. Last year, the amount of wheat smuggled out by the Japanese side along the Yangtze River was quite large, causing a shortage of raw materials for Chinese flour mills, which had to order large quantities of foreign wheat to replenish their stocks. According to reports from the financial sector, from November of last year to the end of March of this year, the import value of foreign wheat alone through the Shanghai and Tianjin customs reached more than 75 million yuan, as reported in previous newspapers. Although there are no detailed statistics for the period since March of this year, the import value should be considerable. In order to ensure the necessary raw materials for industry and commerce, the National Government has approved applications for foreign exchange to purchase wheat. Even during the long-term war of resistance, it has made every effort to maintain production in the rear, demonstrating its unwavering concern for the people's livelihood and its efforts to cultivate and promote growth in every possible way. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side has colluded with unscrupulous merchants in an attempt to use the legal tender plundered from the interior to apply for foreign exchange from the Ministry of Finance under the guise of Chinese factories, order foreign wheat, and ship it to Japan for use as flour milling raw materials. Rumors have been circulating that from mid-November of last year to April of this year, foreign wheat worth more than 20 million yuan has been shipped to Japan, all of which was ordered by exchanging Chinese legal tender for foreign exchange. The industry association has paid special attention to this and is taking measures to prevent it.

Traffic Guidance in the French Concession; Shanghai Motor Association to Hold Regular Lectures

In the past two days, the French Concession police authorities have vigorously implemented traffic safety guidance measures. Supplementary police officers wearing special badges have been stationed at various intersections to direct traffic. In addition, a large number of leaflets and traffic rules for one-way streets have been issued, which will also be distributed to pedestrians and rickshaw pullers. It is also reported that during the safety week, films will be shown to raise awareness of traffic safety among all sectors of society, and publicity will be expanded. The leaflet for pedestrians is as follows:

*   Walk on the sidewalks.
*   Cross the road near intersections and only when the traffic police stop traffic.
*   Before crossing the road, look left and right to see if any vehicles are approaching.
*   When crossing the road with children, hold them by the hand.
*   Do not run when crossing the road.
*   Wait for streetcars on the sidewalks. Only move forward when the streetcar has stopped.

The Shanghai Motor Association Committee issued an urgent notice yesterday, stating:

Sir/Madam,

The city's "Safety Movement Week" is about to be held. In support of this event, our committee will hold a lecture on "Opinions on Safety First for Cyclists" by Ms. Chen Huang Liming in Chinese and English at the Lido Garden, 306 Met Herst Road, at 10 a.m. on June 11. The lecture will cover the various causes of accidents and how to avoid them, so that all listeners will be alerted and reduce the risk of death. We hope that all members will continue their past spirit of cooperation, actively participate, and invite friends to attend, so that this meeting will be a success. Admission tickets are free and can be obtained from Mr. Boutella, Secretary, 39 Tongyun Road.

Sincerely,

The Shanghai Motor Association Committee

Smooth Source; Bamboo Goods Shipped from Ningbo to Shanghai

Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulated that no proof is required for shipping six types of goods, including bamboo, wood, paper, and eggs, the above-mentioned goods have been flowing smoothly. Recently, due to the need for bamboo goods in Shanghai for building cool sheds and making utensils, the number of goods shipped from Ningbo has been particularly large, including 18 pieces of bamboo brand material from Heyu Hang, 18 pieces of bamboo beds and bamboo strips from Sanyou Hang, 29 pieces of bamboo goods from Fuyu Hang, 4 pieces of goods from Fuyu Hang, and 59 pieces of bamboo from Da'an Hang, all of which have arrived in Shanghai one after another.

Britain Vigorously Implements Military Training; Officers Called Back to Country; Shanghai British Army Should Supply 20 Officers; Additional Replacement Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai to Fill Vacancies

According to the Zi Lin News, after the British recently passed the Military Training Act, hundreds of thousands of young people enlisted in the army, requiring a large number of instructors to train them. Therefore, it has requested that British army regular units at home and abroad provide a number of junior instructors to implement this plan. The 1st Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment of the British regular army stationed in Shanghai are also affected by this order and will each provide 20 junior non-commissioned officers to serve as training officers in Britain. It is reported that these people are all qualified to be training officers, but the date of their departure from Shanghai has not yet been determined. Moreover, the strength of the two battalions will not be reduced as a result, as the troop transport ship Dunala has brought replacement soldiers from Britain. The vacancies for junior non-commissioned officers will be filled by promoting some people. The West Yorkshire and East Surrey Regiments are both scheduled to leave Shanghai during the upcoming troop redeployment season. The former will go to India, and the latter will be transferred to Hong Kong. The city will be defended by the 1st Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry Regiment from Scotland. The troop transport ship Dunala is scheduled to leave Shanghai on Friday to return to Britain and will carry several British officers and soldiers who have completed their overseas service.

Dancer Willing to Marry Hall Manager as Wife; Parents Obstruct; Arrested and Detained for Kidnapping for Cohabiting Before Payment of Betrothal Money

Sister Mei, a 17-year-old woman from Tianjin, was brought to Shanghai by her parents in July last year and resided at 499 Met Herst Road. She once worked in a sock factory through an introduction, but later changed her career to dancing, working as a dancer at the Shanghai Dance Hall on Fujian Road. Recently, she developed a love affair with Hu Shaoqing, a Yongbo man who is the hall manager. On the 5th of last month, Hu rented No. 6 Kangle Lane, Xinzha Road, for them to cohabit. On the 1st of this month, they moved to No. 6 Thierry Lane, Yuqing Road, and lived as husband and wife. Recently, Li Xianshen, the father of the woman, and his wife, Ms. Wu, could not agree with their daughter Sister Mei's willingness to marry Hu Shaoqing and secretly cohabit. Therefore, Ms. Wu reported to the Gordon Road Police Station the day before yesterday, accusing Hu of kidnapping her daughter to No. 6 Thierry Lane, Yu Qiaqing Road. Hu was arrested and taken to the police station along with Sister Mei. Sister Mei did not want to return home and was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. Hu Shaoqing was detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution based on Article 241, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for the crime of disrupting family harmony. Li Xianshen, the father of the woman, stated that his daughter Sister Mei disappeared on the 5th of last month and did not return home. He now learned that she had been kidnapped by Hu Shaoqing for cohabitation. When my daughter was a dancer in the Shanghai Dance Hall, she was seduced by him and threatened that if she did not marry him, he would use nitric acid to disfigure her face forever. My daughter was coerced by his threats and ran away to cohabit with him. I request an investigation. However, Sister Mei stated that her parents were aware of this matter. However, her father demanded a betrothal gift of 360 yuan, which Hu could not raise at the time. She was willing to marry him and cohabit first, and they would choose a date to marry after Hu paid the betrothal gift. Furthermore, on the 5th of last month when she left home, her mother bought her utensils such as a footbath, and then she and Hu went home together three times. Hu Shaoqing confessed that Ms. Li voluntarily married him and that he did not kidnap her. He requested leniency. Police lawyer Zhang requested a postponement as Ms. Wu, the mother of the woman, had not arrived. Huang Risheng submitted a motion to transfer Hu Shaoqing to detention, and the hearing was postponed to the morning of the 9th. Sister Mei was taken back by her father.

Posing as Customers Stealing Jewelry; Resulting in Arrest of Both Person and Goods

Shi Qing Silver Shop, located at 388 Gongguan Ma Road (i.e., French Avenue), east of the Fire Brigade Street and at the entrance of Shengping Lane, has been in business for many years. At around 9 a.m. yesterday (7th), a bandit dressed in a blue silk cheongsam, about twenty years old, posed as a customer and went to the silver shop to purchase gold rings. The counter clerk took out four or five gold rings of various sizes for the bandit to choose from. The bandit immediately selected two new-style small square gold rings, one weighing 1.3 qian and the other weighing 1.4 qian, with a total value of about 60 yuan. While arguing about the price, the bandit snatched the two gold rings and fled out the door. When he reached Yide Lane on Xinqiao Street, he was apprehended by a patrolman. The original stolen gold rings were found on his person. Both the person and the goods were taken to the police station for investigation.

Female Employee of Casino Abuses Maid and Goes to Jail; Although the Maid's Behavior Was Bad, She Should Not Have Been Harmed; Reported by the Second Landlord and Sentenced to Four Months

Wu Huikang, an accountant at the Cotton Yarn Exchange, lives at No. 5, Lane 607, Beijing Road. However, Wu has a concubine, Ms. Zhou, who is from Anhui and 37 years old, lives separately at No. 12, Lane 1292, Aiduya Road, and employs a 16-year-old Changzhou girl, Wu Chunlan, as a maid. However, because Chunlan's behavior was improper, she was abused by Wu Zhou. The second landlord, Ni Anfu, repeatedly warned her. However, she not only did not listen but also worked as a female employee at the Rongsheng Company casino on Jessfield Road in Shanghai West, not returning home all night. She imprisoned Chunlan in the room, depriving her of her freedom of movement and not providing her with food, hindering her physical development. On the night of the 27th of last month, Chunlan shouted for help because she was extremely hungry. Her neighbors and the second landlord felt unbearable and provided her with food. The second landlord, Ni Anfu, reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which sent Detective Xu Decu to rescue Wu Chunlan from the lock and take her to the police station. She was transferred to the Jiliang Institute for care. A warrant was requested from the First Special Court, and Wu Zhou was summoned to the Second Criminal Court this morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a lawsuit in accordance with Articles 286 and 296 of the Criminal Law and stated the case. According to the second landlord Ni Anfu, Wu Chunlan's behavior was indeed improper, but the defendant should not have abused her and imprisoned her without food. I have repeatedly advised her and sent a letter to the defendant's husband, but to no avail. Therefore, I reported it to the police. According to Wu Chunlan, she was beaten and imprisoned. The defendant's testimony was evasive. The judge sentenced Wu Zhou in court to four months of imprisonment for illegal detention. During the appeal period, she would be allowed to be released on bail of 1,000 yuan.

Feng Baorong Forges a Will; Occupies His Nephew's Huge Fortune; The Second Special Court Continued the Hearing Yesterday

Feng Baorong, a Yongbo man who has been running a denture shop in Baxianqiao for over sixty years and lives at No. 3, Yuyang Lane, Bairenbu Road, inherited tens of thousands of dollars in property after his cousin Feng Yimei and sister-in-law Feng Jin passed away one after another. Feng claimed that when Feng Jin passed away, she had a will ordering him to manage all the property and to act as guardian for Feng Yimei's grandson (Feng Yimei's son Feng Shanzhang's posthumous child) Feng Yangsheng and adopted grandson Feng Qingfa, disregarding Feng Wang (33 years old, living at No. 38 Yuye Lane, Xiafei Road), Feng Yangsheng's biological mother. Therefore, Feng Wang entrusted lawyers Yu Xiangqin, Lu Shanyu, and Yu Zhongluo to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting that Feng Baorong be ordered to hand over all the property and to confirm Feng Wang as the legal guardian of Feng Qingsheng and Feng Qingfa. The case has been repeatedly summoned by Judge Wu Xiaoke and has not yet been concluded. Feng Guifen, an important witness in the case, surrendered to the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court at the end of last month, stating that when she testified in the Civil Court, she stated that the will was real, but in fact, she was lying because she was induced by Feng Baorong and his son Feng Shanliang, and requested leniency. The case has also been investigated by Prosecutor Wang Ren and is now pending review. Prosecutor Wang Ren reviewed the case and believed that Feng Baorong and his son were suspected of instigating perjury. Yesterday, he specially opened the Fifth Court and ordered Feng Baorong and Shan Liang to be brought to court for investigation. Feng Wang was also summoned to court for questioning. According to Feng Guifen's confession when she surrendered, Prosecutor Wang questioned Feng Baorong. Feng still said that his sister-in-law Feng Jin dictated the will, so he followed the will and managed all the property, denying the forgery of the will. Feng Shanliang testified that when Feng Wang accused my father (referring to Feng Baorong) of occupying the property, probably a few days before the court hearing, I wrote a piece of paper and gave it to the witness Feng Guifen as a memo, saying that he would not forget what to say in court. I didn't know he had any other purpose. Feng Wang testified that after my grandfather Feng Yimei passed away, my husband Feng Shanzhang also died. The family property was managed by my grandmother. Later, I gave birth to a posthumous child and adopted a son Feng Qingfa, who I raised. Uncle Feng Baorong caused discord between us, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. I have been a widow for more than ten years and hope to raise two children to adulthood. Unexpectedly, after my grandmother passed away, my uncle forged my grandmother's will and occupied all the property. Many relatives were present when my grandmother died and said that there was no will. After verifying the testimony in court, Feng Baorong was ordered to be released on bail of 500 yuan from the shop, pending review.

Opium and Drug Trafficking Rampant in Yanpu Area of Pudong

Opium and drug trafficking is rampant in the Yanpu area of Pudong. According to investigations by relevant parties, there are more than 1,000 opium dens and white powder drug dens in the Yangjing area. There are also more than 1,000 in the Tangqiao, Yangsi, and Gaohang areas (some of which sell both opium and white powder). In total, there are more than 2,000 drug outlets in the Japanese strongholds in Yanpu. Assuming an average of 20 customers per day for each outlet, there are 40,000 drug addicts. The actual number is even higher, which is shocking. As for the source of the drugs, although there are no local opium dens, someone transports opium. White powder and heroin are sold by agencies in each town, and there is no shortage of supply. The majority of drug addicts are thieves, hooligans, "San Huazi," and fake "soldiers," fake "civil servants," and fake "police."

Educational News: An Overview of Vocational Education in China (1)
Establishing Practical Vocational Schools in Each County to Solve Basic Needs

(Chongqing Correspondence) Regarding an overview of vocational education in China, recently the Ministry of Education compiled statistics and reports detailing this. The following is a summary:

Institutional Setup

The system of vocational schools, in the early years of the Republic of China, was divided into two types: Type A and Type B industrial schools. Type A industrial schools were equivalent to middle schools, and Type B industrial schools were equivalent to higher elementary schools. After the promulgation of the new school system in the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), the status of vocational schools was clearly defined, being placed on par with middle schools and normal schools. The former Type A industrial schools were transformed into vocational schools equivalent to senior high schools or agricultural, industrial, and commercial departments of senior high schools, enrolling junior high school graduates. Type B industrial schools were transformed into vocational schools equivalent to junior high schools, enrolling higher elementary school graduates. In addition to independent vocational schools, they could be established in conjunction with middle schools and normal schools. The First National Education Conference in the seventeenth year of the Republic (1928) did not make major changes to the secondary education system but stipulated that senior high schools should establish general, normal, agricultural, industrial, commercial, and home economics departments, which was not significantly different from the previous system. The Second National Education Conference in the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930) emphasized scientific experimentation and productive capacity. The plan to improve secondary education included the following points:

(A)  Senior high schools should increase the number of vocational departments, focusing on agricultural and industrial departments.

(B)  The ratio of general senior high schools and senior high schools with normal, commercial, and home economics departments to senior high schools with agricultural and industrial departments should be: (1) Agricultural and industrial senior high schools should account for half of the total, and other senior high schools should account for the other half. (2) If the number of general senior high schools and agricultural and industrial senior high schools exceeds the aforementioned ratio, the excess general senior high schools should be converted into agricultural and industrial high schools in the short term.

In the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), the Ministry of Education issued a general order to all provinces to restrict the establishment of general middle schools and expand vocational schools. It stipulated that starting from the twentieth year, higher and lower level agricultural and industrial vocational schools should be added, county middle schools should be gradually converted into vocational schools, and private applications to establish middle schools should be persuaded to change to vocational schools. Vocational education was actively promoted in this way, and the perception of people in society changed accordingly.

In the twenty-first year of the Republic (1932), the government promulgated the Vocational School Law, dividing vocational schools into junior and senior levels. Junior level schools enrolled elementary school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications, with a duration of three years. The principle was to establish them independently and not charge tuition fees.

In the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933), the Ministry of Education promulgated the Vocational School Regulations, providing detailed provisions for establishment, enrollment, curriculum, internships, and teachers. The system and regulations for running vocational schools were thus complete.

In the same year, the Ministry of Education also promulgated the Vocational Supplementary School Regulations. For young people who had not yet engaged in a profession, to supplement their existing or future professional knowledge and skills, anyone who had received considerable literacy education and was over twelve years of age could enroll. The organization was divided into two types: semester system and subject system. A portion of time was designated for learning daily, weekly, during winter vacation, or during leisure time.

In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic (1935), in order to cultivate technical personnel in certain businesses, the Ministry of Education promulgated temporary measures for short-term vocational training classes, which required that applicants have junior high school or senior high school education or equivalent qualifications and that the duration of study not be very long, in order to promote this.

In the twenty-seventh year of the Republic (1938), in order to solve the basic needs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation for a county or district, the Ministry of Education specially formulated measures for counties and cities to establish junior-level practical vocational schools. Initially, one school was to be established in each of the three provinces of Guangxi and Gansu, with funds allocated by the Ministry. All expenses and first-year operating costs were to be borne by the Ministry, and in the second year, the provincial government would take over. Other provinces and regions were to gradually prepare for establishment and encourage local efforts to promote this.

Economical Shoe Soles Worth Introducing by Tian Jianzhong

Shoes, though small, are essential. Unless you stay in bed, you can't do without them. In the necessities of life, they occupy both clothing and transportation.

Especially for families with many children, it's a real problem. Kids wear out shoes quickly, either tearing the upper or breaking the sole, and the sole is more expensive than the upper. Most ordinary shoes have leather or cloth soles. Leather soles are expensive, costing at least six or seven cents a pair. Cloth soles are cheaper, but they fuzz up after a few days and aren't durable.

Let me introduce an economical and attractive shoe sole. The process isn't as troublesome as making cloth soles, and it doesn't cost a cent. You probably have old basketball or running shoes at home. Just cut off the upper, and cut out the sole. These shoes always break at the upper, never the sole, unlike leather shoes that break at the sole and can be resoled.

After cutting out the sole, you have a good rubber sole. Adjust it slightly to fit your foot size, and it becomes the sole you need. The style and material of the upper can be chosen according to your preferences. If you want it to be more durable, sew a layer of thread like you would with a cloth sole.

This is suitable for making soles for children's shoes, as well as for housewives and female students. Just make the upper a bit more attractive. As the weather warms, you can make various cutout styles. It's a fashionable and practical item made from waste, which aligns with the principles of economy and frugality. I hope ladies will promote it!

A Week's Economical Menu by Ms. Hua Ying

Cabbage has been cheap lately, costing a dime for three or four heads. I've always loved cabbage, so I eat it three or four times a week, whether it's meat or vegetarian. There are many ways to cook it with meat, such as cabbage stir-fried with sliced meat or shredded meat, which are the most common. It's also suitable for soup, such as the popular beef steak soup in Russian restaurants, which Russians call "Borsch." It's mostly cabbage, with a piece of beef steak and some tomatoes. We can make it at home, and it tastes similar. If you don't use beef, you can use sliced pork or ham. After the cabbage is stewed, it tastes like gelatinous vegetables. You can also wrap finely chopped meat in large cabbage leaves and cook them, making a quilt-like shape that's delicious to eat. For vegetarian cooking, you can braise it in soy sauce or cook it plain. Or, you can stew it slightly and mix it with soy sauce, vinegar, and red pepper shreds to make a spicy and sour dish, which is also good with porridge or wine. However, cabbage should be stewed until tender; if it's too crisp, it won't taste good.

From Frozen Cream to Ice Cream by He Qiefang

The summer monsoon tells us that ice cream is in season. Streets, public places, banquets are all filled with refreshing ice cream and its advertisements. But do you know the origin of ice cream and its interesting legends?

Its origins cannot be traced in detail. Queen Alexandra loved to drink ice water and cold drinks, and specially sent her subordinates to knock ice and collect fresh fruits for storage. The taste was good and refreshing, so it became a sacred item. This may be the root of it.

In the early 17th century, King Louis XIV of France wrote after a palace banquet: "At the end of the banquet, each guest was presented with a silver cup containing an egg-like object. Many people were surprised by this new item. After tasting a bite, they realized it was a delicious frozen cream."

It was not until 1660 that cafes in Paris sold frozen cream. England and other countries rushed to imitate it, but before this period, all frozen drinks had no sweetness. Later, the method of making ice cream was compiled into a special book, which told people that they could add sugar and various fresh fruit juices, so there was progress.

At the same time, the method of making ice cream spread to the Americas. Master Chef Philorenci carefully studied it and publicly expressed his views in newspapers. He was dedicated to improving cuisine and was very famous at the time, so it became even more popular. In the United States, Philorenci's name was well-known. In fact, he also learned and adapted it from London. In 1789, he was responsible for the ice cream used at George Washington's banquet, which can be called a grand event.

Now it is packaged in paper cups and tin foil, and the variety of ingredients is constantly updated, changing every year. Some people predict that in Shanghai in the next two years, there will be ice cream cones installed along the roadside. Insert a legal tender and it will automatically rotate and condense into a cup, allowing you to choose coffee, cocoa, banana, or lemon.

A Brief History of Bicycles (Part 1) by Xi

The bicycle is a good tool for transportation, light and agile. It can be driven freely after only a few days of learning, so its use is becoming more widespread. The total number of bicycles in Shanghai today can be called the highest in the Far East. According to recent statistics, there are 54,000 bicycles in the Public Concession and the French Concession, and how many in Greater Shanghai cannot be determined now, but there were more than 4,000 before the August 13th Incident two years ago. There are two main reasons for the increasing number of bicycles:

(1) Since the war, many wide school buildings outside the concessions and north of the Suzhou River have been completely closed. The newly relocated school sites are very narrow and do not have dormitories. Therefore, day students buy bicycles to save money and for convenience. In addition, in recent years, Chinese stores have immediately sent people to deliver goods to customers' doors after receiving phone calls from customers to purchase goods. Although the wages of these delivery coolies are low, they still need to provide their own bicycles and rely entirely on the tips from delivery to subsidize their income.

(2) After the fall of Shanghai, the wireless radio bureau and telegraph bureau run by the government dismissed the messengers. A portion of them, being idle, organized a delivery agency specializing in delivering goods for merchants, charging by the hour or by the number of items. They all drove bicycles when delivering goods.

The agency that employs the most bicycle couriers is, of course, the China Post Office. Many of those green-clad postmen are skilled in driving bicycles.

The latest and most fashionable bicycles can only be purchased by students with the means. Many Chinese students are also skilled drivers, and often get girlfriends because of it. Male students consider it a great honor when female classmates ask him to teach them how to drive, and they do their best to be considerate. After the instruction, they go on outings together and many enviable romances occur.

Bicycles are not only popular in Shanghai. Currently, in many cities in the interior, because public buses have been requisitioned for military use and rickshaws are too expensive, people also use bicycles for transportation for economy and speed. As a result, the demand for bicycles exceeds the supply, and the price of cars is soaring, now more than double what it was before the war.

To commemorate it, 25 leaders of the Weir bicycle industry held a complete course on April 21.

The first bicycle was built by Shan McMIllan in 1839. Prior to that, the Encyclopedia Britannica published a circle with the caption: "Some small figures are moving in order, from the first to the last, and then back to the first, spinning continuously." (Translator's note: roughly like a Chinese revolving lantern)

When McMillan's first car drove on the streets of the small town of Kauchi Hill in Scotland, it was indeed very novel. He changed the "Dandy Horse." Speaking of this, we have to go back even further to 50 years ago, when a child's rocking horse with wheels appeared in Paris one day in 1780, causing the city people to applaud and laugh. But Mr. Blanchard and Mr. Marklier put a lot of thought into this. (Translated from the English Greater American Evening News)

Free Talk: Depth and Originality by Ding Ti

In these difficult times, raising the banner of freedom and liberation, depicting the moving stories of countless heroic figures, their successful achievements, or tragic sacrifices, exploring the vibrant hearts of millions, transferring their urgent breaths in the midst of gunfire onto paper, exposing the already rotten walking corpses and zombies behind their masks, stripping off their ugly disguises, whether you are carving a beautiful monument or exposing the ugliness of souls, you need to delve deeper, so that readers sing praises for beauty and gnash their teeth for ugliness.

Naturally, not only now, but the main function of literature has always been to infect readers. A capable and unpretentious writer never wants readers to remain indifferent after seeing their work. Often, the success of a work lies in readers becoming prisoners of their spirit. They can understand the author's emotions, and they can reproduce the author's artistic conception. Therefore, the author's efforts are not in vain. The more they work hard, the more benefits readers receive.

### Chinese Troops Victorious North of the Xinqiang River; All Japanese Troops South of Dali Mountain Completely Eliminated; Ketzong Defense and Tayun Mountain and Hyuga Taolin Recaptured from Retreating Troops

Miluo: Our Chinese troops north of the Xinqiang River have once again reported a victory. It is reported that since before dawn yesterday, after completely eliminating all Japanese troops south of Dali Mountain, ten kilometers southeast of Taolin, they immediately took advantage of the victory to divide into two routes to pursue northwards. One route attacked Dali Mountain, and the other made a roundabout flanking attack on Ketzong Defense, ten kilometers north of Tayun Mountain. After fierce fighting until around 3:00 AM this morning, Ketzong Defense and Tayun Mountain were successively recovered by our troops. Our troops killed more than forty Japanese soldiers, seized fifty-two rifles and five machine guns. The remnants fled towards Taolin. Our troops are continuing the pursuit. (7th dispatch)

(Yichang) The Japanese troops active in central Hubei recently are still the defeated remnants from northern Hubei. The Japanese troops in Jingshan and Tianmen and other places retreated in multiple routes yesterday, one part of which retreated to Xiaogan, their intentions unknown. In the Jiukou area, our troops have launched fierce attacks for days, killing a great number of Japanese troops.

(Chongqing) At a reception for reporters here yesterday, a Chinese military spokesman revealed that on May 29th, the Japanese troops, under the cover of artillery fire and aircraft, crossed the Han River at Heilu Ferry and decided to invade and occupy Qianjiang. The reason was that during the battle of Dahong Mountain in northern Hubei, the Chinese troops on the west bank of the Han River crossed the river to attack the rear of the Japanese troops, and after the Japanese troops retreated from Zhaoyang, they sent a strong force to the area west of Hankou and forcibly crossed the Han River near Qianjiang. Currently, our troops are attacking the Japanese troops in Qianjiang from both the east and west. He believes that the fighting in that area will not develop into a major battle. In Henan Province, the Japanese troops have intentionally widened the breach in the Yellow River levee near Jinkou Town (transliterated) from two hundred meters to one thousand meters, allowing the Yellow River floodwaters to flow into the southwest. Their purpose is to prevent the Chinese troops in Henan Province from moving east to attack the Japanese troops in the Kaifeng area. On June 1st, the Japanese troops in western Shanxi began to advance in three routes towards Qikou Town on the east bank of the Yellow River. Liulin is currently in battle. (7th Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to a Chinese military spokesman, the fighting on all fronts last week has now subsided because the Japanese forces are insufficient and unable to advance. There have been no changes in the Guangdong-Jiangxi war situation, only slight contact in the Han River area. However, the number of Japanese troops who crossed the Han River and are fighting fiercely in Qianjiang is only about one thousand. (7th Haitong News Agency dispatch)
