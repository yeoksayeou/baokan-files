### Japanese Air Force Suffers Heavy Losses

More Than a Thousand Planes Lost in One and a Half Years

Location Undisclosed An air force spokesperson told reporters that, according to an announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters on January 20th of the 28th year, since the beginning of the war of aggression against China, up to December 30th of the 27th year, a total of 710 army and navy aircraft have been lost. In addition, there are 300 aircraft that were damaged beyond repair, for a total of 1,010 aircraft. This figure is consistent with the results of the statistics compiled by the Chinese side. Of these, 221 were shot down in the air by the Chinese air force, 179 were destroyed by the Chinese air force through bombing, 83 were shot down by Chinese anti-aircraft artillery, 107 were destroyed by Chinese army attacks, 11 were destroyed by Chinese artillery, 19 Japanese planes made forced landings, and 27 were shot down by the Chinese army and their whereabouts are unknown, or were seriously damaged and made forced landings in Japanese positions, for a total of 647 aircraft. Adding to this the conservatively estimated loss rate of 363 aircraft due to flight accidents (the actual number must be higher than this), the grand total is 1,010 aircraft, averaging more than 56 aircraft lost per month, which can be said to be a heavy loss. Since New Year's Day of the 28th year, 24 aircraft have already been shot down or destroyed by the Chinese air force, anti-aircraft artillery, and army units, of which the heroic Chinese air force fighters shot down 15 of the newest and most advanced heavy bombers recently purchased from Europe and the West over Lanzhou, inflicting a serious blow to the Japanese air force.

### Japanese Military Headquarters Admits Failure of Lanzhou Air Raid

(Tokyo) According to a spokesman for the Japanese military headquarters, the third air raid on Lanzhou on the 23rd of this month was unsuccessful, with three Japanese planes being shot down and 18 air force soldiers being lost. Another plane, although able to fly back to its base, was hit by 153 bullets and has become a scrap heap. As for the Chinese losses, reports from various sources are still "contradictory" and need to be "sorted out" before they can be announced, it was said. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)

(Beiping) A spokesman for the Japanese army admitted yesterday at a reception for foreign journalists that three Japanese bombers and eighteen pilots were lost during the Japanese air raid on Lanzhou on the 23rd of this month. The spokesman went on to say that the remaining Japanese aircraft that returned to base had been hit by multiple bullets, and as a result, nine Japanese pilots were injured.

### Japanese Troops in Suiyuan Are Weak

Afraid of Attacks by Chinese Guerrilla Forces

Forcing Residents of Various Villages to Move

Hequ A person from Guisui said that the strength of the Japanese troops in Suiyuan city is currently very empty, and they are constantly afraid of attacks by Chinese guerrilla forces. Sandbags have been piled up in various remote alleys to block traffic, and fortifications have only been set up at thoroughfares and key passes. A broadcasting machine has been set up on the drum tower in the old city, and each village within a dozen miles of the suburbs has a dispatcher. In the event of an emergency, they immediately raise lights as a signal, and the broadcasting machine reports to the military and civilians in the two cities to quickly prepare for defense. Due to the insufficient distribution of troops, all Japanese and Korean merchants are engaged in business during the day and formed into guard teams at night. Due to the tight military budget, the Japanese recently convened a streamlining conference to drastically reduce the Mongolian puppet army. Although the troops of De Wang and Li Shouxin are nominally ten divisions, they actually number only a few thousand men. After being streamlined by the conference, they have been further reduced, and the Mongolian puppet troops are ordered to be separately organized and not to be mixed and linked, fearing that their strength will be too great and difficult to control. De, Li, and the Mongolian puppet army are very dissatisfied with this arrangement by the Japanese, and there is a possibility of unrest from time to time. The strength of the Japanese troops stationed in various counties is also extremely weak. Although they are transferred and moved from time to time, ostensibly to increase defenses and supplement troops, in reality it is a trick to show off and conceal their fear and anxiety. Politically, although the highest puppet organization is the Mongolian United Autonomous Government and the provincial government, with De Wang as a puppet, the Guisui Public Office is separately established, and the administrative power is purely controlled by the Japanese. The puppet county governments and police stations that were formerly organized by the Japanese using local gentry in various counties have recently been removed and replaced by their trusted Chinese traitors. This can be described as "when the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked," a lesson for opportunistic Chinese traitors. Because Chinese guerrilla forces are lurking in the suburbs of various county towns, the Japanese policies and orders are still difficult to leave the city gates, and they are at a loss. In recent months, the Japanese army has twice launched large-scale encirclements of Daqingshan, attempting to destroy the base of the Chinese guerrilla forces, but ultimately failed to achieve their wishes. Therefore, they have recently intensified their efforts to drive the residents of various villages along the Ping-Sui Railway Line and both sides of the road to relocate to areas designated by the Japanese army, and those who refuse to move are immediately slaughtered, intending to clear the fields to control the activities of Chinese guerrilla forces. This kind of desperate and futile action by the Japanese army is a waste of effort and ultimately cannot do anything about the Chinese army. (24th Telegram)

### Japanese Troops in Jiaozuo Fleeing to Bo'ai

(Luoyang) According to a telephone report from the front, at 10:00 AM on the 24th, over three hundred Japanese infantrymen and three mountain guns from Jiaozuo fled towards Bo'ai. When passing through Baiyue Village (over twenty miles east of Bo'ai), they were intercepted by local Chinese troops, who killed dozens of Japanese soldiers and seized three light machine guns and over a dozen rifles. The remaining Japanese troops fled in panic towards the south gate of Bo'ai. (26th Telegram)

### Purpose of Japanese Troops Invading Western Hubei

To Consolidate the Ying-Zao Line to Defend Against Chinese Counterattacks

To Probe for Opportunities to Harass, Which Is of a Guerrilla Nature

Zhongxiang The purpose of the Japanese troops' decision to invade western Hubei is to support the security line in the southern part of the Ping-Han Railway and consolidate the defensive positions of the Ying-Zao defense line to prevent Chinese counterattacks. Although they have recently dispatched small numbers of troops to probe for opportunities to harass, this is also of a guerrilla nature. When Chinese troops counterattack, they retreat immediately. Currently, the front line on the right wing is still confronting each other near Yuekou and Xiachengyi. (26th Telegram)

Changde According to a telephone report from Huarong, a certain unit of Chinese guerrilla forces encountered Japanese soldiers at a certain place fifteen miles from Zhuhekou some days ago and engaged in a fierce battle. At that time, because the Japanese were numerous and the Chinese were few, the Chinese troops immediately dispersed and hid in the surrounding villages. Later, with the assistance of friendly forces, they launched simultaneously from various places and surrounded and severely suppressed the Japanese troops, achieving considerable gains. The remaining Japanese troops were defeated and fled in disarray back to Bailuoji. The Japanese troops who harassed Huahue Muqiao from Bailuoji were also repelled by the Chinese Jianli Self-Defense Corps. (26th Telegram)

(Chongqing) The battles on the Hanyi Highway became more intense again on the 23rd. Although the Japanese army has made considerable progress, the price they have paid is quite heavy. Military figures on the Chinese side here do not attach importance to the battles in that area, believing that the Japanese army has no ability to invade Yichang and Shashi to the west. It is said that the Japanese army is currently advancing in three routes, but each route consists of only a few hundred men, and their purpose is only to pressure the Chinese guerrilla forces in central Hubei to retreat westward in order to reduce the threat to Wuhan. At present, there are three locations where Chinese and Japanese troops are engaged in fierce fighting: one is Sanyangdian, north of Jingshan; one is the Nanshanmiao Qinglongshan area, southwest of Jingshan; and one is near Yuekou. A strong unit of the Chinese army launched an attack southward from Fenshuiling yesterday, and after three hours of fierce fighting, recaptured Qianjiafang, west of Zaoshi, cutting off the retreat of the Japanese troops in Wamiaoji. Another team of Chinese troops is currently advancing northward from Zhengjiatan, counterattacking Tianmen and threatening the Japanese troops' flank in Yuekou. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)

### Yu Officials Never Considered Kita's Proposed "Dream" of Peace

Japanese Intend to Use Forged "Three Principles of the People"

Kita's Peace Plan Is Not a Novel Event

(Chongqing) Since Chongqing received Kita's proposed peace plan, various parties have expressed sarcasm, ridicule, and extreme contempt. Officials who are well-versed in Japanese studies have issued the following comments: (1) Japan's adoption of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People indicates that Japan has spiritually succumbed to China. Even Hiranuma and Itagaki have publicly discussed the Three Principles of the People in the Diet, indicating that the Japanese are considering using the Three Principles of the People and reinterpreting them. However, the Chinese people will never believe the "Three Principles of the People" manufactured by the Japanese. (2) Kita, as the leader of the special affairs organ in Beiping, is the first Japanese officer to publicly formulate a peace program. Tokyo has long had the intention of seeking peace. Initially, the puppet regime in Beiping came forward to call for peace, but to no avail. Currently, the Japanese are "impatiently waiting" for a peace settlement, so they personally put forward a peace proposal. (3) Although Wang Jingwei has an inclination towards peace, Kuomintang figures believe that he will certainly not participate in the so-called Kuomintang government in Nanjing. (4) The so-called invitation to Chiang Kai-shek to join the Nanjing regime is "an absolute insult to China, and China and the Chinese people will never consider accepting such an insult." (5) According to unconfirmed reports, Kita has opposed preparing for war against China since the beginning of the war, so he tried to prevent the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, but failed. Kita's wife is Chinese, so he is quite knowledgeable about Chinese affairs, and he is also good at writing in Chinese. Tokyo's choice of him as a person to seek peace is indeed a success. However, the error in the Japanese's new peace plan is that they do not know that the Chinese people are not easily deceived by a fake Kuomintang and a reinterpreted Three Principles of the People. (6) Chongqing has not only not considered Kita's "dream," but Chinese experts on Japanese studies have warned the people of the whole country for months that the Japanese are conspiring to organize a new Kuomintang. Therefore, Kita's peace plan is no longer a novel event in the eyes of the people in Chongqing. (26th Associated Press Telegram)

Editorial

### End of the Spanish Civil War

Today will be a day worth mentioning in world history

The governments of Great Britain and France will simultaneously announce today the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government of Spain. The Foreign Minister of the Spanish Republican government, Mr. Alvarez, went to France yesterday to visit Mr. Azaña, the President of the Spanish Republican government who is a guest in Paris, to report that the Republican government's cabinet meeting had decided to accept the advice of Great Britain and France to stop the war. Mr. Azaña also decided to announce his resignation and step down when Great Britain and France announced their recognition of the Nationalist government. The Spanish Civil War has thus come to an end. The Spanish Civil War lasted for more than thirty-one months; its impact: not only has the fate of Spain been changed to another stage, but also the overall situation in Western Europe and the state of the Mediterranean have been turbulent and dangerous due to the Spanish Civil War, creating an important catalyst for international war and pushing the international community to the peak of the watershed between peace and war; thereafter, the ebb and flow of British and French power with that of Germany and Italy, the ebb and flow of the division between democracy and autocracy, the ebb and flow of international political ideas of maintaining the international status quo with peace and changing the international status quo with force, we do not need to mix any subjectivity to discuss their strengths and weaknesses, distinguish their good and bad, identify their advantages and disadvantages, and judge their destination, but it will inevitably have its own ebb and flow and be very different from the past, so it is also a key to decide whether the Spanish Civil War is brewing or dissipating or growing. Since the impact is so profound and it lasted so long, today's end of the civil war is a symbol for historians to draw a period. Recalling the past thirty-one months, news about the war never stopped; the number of changes was so frequent that it was difficult to record them all. As it is a major event in modern times, it should not be regarded as fleeting clouds. Let's try to briefly describe its outline, if the reader does not think the language is superfluous.

On July 17, 1936, the troops stationed in Melilla, a place in northern Morocco on the Mediterranean coast, which is the African territory of the Spanish Republic, launched an uprising. This was the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. The head of state at the time was President Azaña, who decided to step down today; the leader of the rebels at the time was General Franco, who today obtained the recognition of Great Britain, France, and other countries as the legitimate government of Spain. Five days earlier, Mr. Sotelo, the leader of the extreme right-wing political family of the Royalist Party, was assassinated, and the government re-searched for right-wing figures on a large scale. The fuse of the civil war was actually tied to this. Originally, Spanish politics had long been in a state of decline, and the left and right wings had been incompatible for a long time. Although the Popular Front of the left wing was in power, its prestige was not enough to suppress the whole country. Therefore, the starting point of one corner responded to the four sides, and the fact that it was finally overthrown was due to complicated reasons, but it is undeniable that its own fragility was particularly severe. There are many historical facts about any country that fights a civil war due to internal strife. It is only a matter of brothers fighting each other, and the winner is the king, but it is not what is said in Spain. From the day the Spanish Civil War began, the international community was already in turmoil. Because Spain is not strong among the European countries, but because of its geographical relationship, it can be important, so those who compete for hegemony in Europe are competing for Spain for their own use; the political magnates of that country can also form foreign aid. Therefore, in peacetime, the machinations and traces of the horse's feet could not conceal its international background. Once the short soldiers were engaged, the picture was revealed. Less than half a month after the uprising in Morocco, it was reported that Italian military aircraft had joined the Nationalist army; although Rome did not admit it at the time, those who knew a little about the international situation had already asserted that it must not be false. Germany and Italy were in cahoots, while Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries intended to protect the Republican government and confront Germany and Italy. In the parliaments of various countries, they publicly took sides with both sides of the Spanish Civil War according to their beliefs. Therefore, the thirty-one months of bloodshed, although it was a civil war in one country, was no less than an epitome of European international relations.

The indirect struggle gradually became an open confrontation; the fact that it did not expand and spread to become the Second World War was a matter of great urgency. On August 1 of this year, the French government suggested to Great Britain and Italy that all countries should remain neutral in the Spanish civil war; there were intrigues, deceptions, and twists and turns, and it took a month to gradually get on track. On September 9, the International Adjustment Committee on the issue of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War held its first decision-making meeting, with twenty-six countries participating. From then on, those who were sincere in their work either blocked the border, or prohibited their people from going to Spain to join the army, or prohibited the transportation of military supplies to Spain, which ultimately became the main factor in the defeat of the Spanish Republican government. Others initially feigned compliance and then blatantly broke their promises, with volunteers, airplanes, and artillery continuously arriving, ultimately becoming the main backing for the victory of the Spanish Nationalist army. The fact that there is today's outcome after thirty-one months cannot be said to be due to the nominal existence of the Adjustment Committee. However, the Adjustment Committee also had a great effect; if there had been no organization of the Adjustment Committee, reducing friction at the beginning and repeatedly buffering in between, they would have been forced to enter the vortex together; then the victory or defeat of the two armies in Spain, although different from today, the state of the entire international community is not what it can be imagined today.

The Spanish Civil War is about to end, but its own development has not ended, and the international evolution caused by it has not ended; whether it becomes more tense or gradually opens up, each has its own possibilities, which needs to be answered by facts and cannot be foreseen.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council's Strong Reply to Japan

Japanese Authorities Hold Meeting

Decided to Issue Another Note Today

After the Japanese representative filed a protest with the Municipal Council a few days ago regarding the terrorist atrocities, Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, sent a reply to the Japanese authorities on Saturday, but the contents have not been revealed. It is heard that the wording is quite firm. According to the Allied News Agency, Japanese army, navy, and consular personnel met on the flagship "Izumo" yesterday afternoon for three hours. It is expected that the Japanese side will send another note to the Council today. It is heard that the resolution agreed upon during the talks by Japanese personnel will be included in the note to be sent today. At the same time, patrol teams in various districts of the Public Concession continue to patrol in the rain. Search teams are checking people coming from Pudong on the Bund, and search teams in the western district have been checking buses coming from the west and east since the invasion this morning. Although the inspections were slightly more relaxed during the happy hour in the middle of the day, it is heard that they continued until late last night. Coolies from the Public Works Department have completed the erection of barbed wire in the central district, and yesterday they closed various street alleys in the Chengdu Road district. Work has also begun in the Jing'an Temple district, and the streets outside the concession that are bordered by the non-concession area will also be completely equipped with barbed wire to prevent illegal elements from entering the Public Concession. This kind of preparedness to deal with terrorist cases has never been seen before, and the western district is the most heavily guarded. No puppet personnel have been assassinated in the past five days.

(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, a spokesman for the Nanjing "Reformed Government" declared that we must now declare a "silent declaration of war" on the Shanghai Public Concession and British and French ships. Their actions are nothing more than expanding the concession and using the Yangtze River as a base to help the Chiang Kai-shek regime. The government has transferred troops and militia to be stationed around the concession to prevent the continued occurrence of terrorist demonstrations. If Britain and France do not reconsider and change their attitude regarding assistance to the Chiang regime, then we will not hesitate to regard the British and French forces in the Public Concession as enemies. The news also stated that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai are obviously dissatisfied with the plan taken by the Municipal Council, calling it a cold plan, and that they consider the Municipal Council's reply to the Japanese request to be the same. The Japanese authorities are holding an emergency meeting today to determine the final steps to deal with the overall situation. (26th Reuters Telegram)

Because it was late, it could not continue the flight, so it was scheduled to continue flying to Chongqing at 9:00 AM on the 27th. According to pilot Tan, everything was very smooth on this flight, and the climate changes were not drastic. However, it is still difficult to predict what the rainy season will be like.

### Guerrilla Forces Control North China

(Beiping) Since the Japanese army launched the large-scale "Purification" campaign in North China, it has been nearly a year, and the result can be said to be a complete failure, because in North China, except for a few transportation lines, the remaining ninety percent is still under the jurisdiction of the Chinese guerrillas. According to the Japanese authorities here, areas around Datong-Puzhou, Shijiazhuang, and Taiyuan, as well as the border areas of Hebei and Shandong and the border areas of Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi, are all "dangerous areas" that are beyond the reach of the Japanese army or the decrees of the "provisional government."

### Chinese Troops Besiege Japanese Troops in Central Hebei

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: Japanese propaganda claimed a siege operation in central Hebei. In recent days, the Japanese troops in Nangong, Jixian, Juye, and other places have been, on the contrary, besieged by Chinese troops. Chinese guerrillas have repeatedly achieved battle successes. Before the Japanese troops arrived, the Chinese troops implemented a scorched-earth policy and encircled them from all sides. When the Japanese troops arrived in Nangong city, there was no rice or firewood, and even water was nowhere to be found. The Chinese troops also cut off the Japanese troops' supplies, so after several days, the Japanese troops could not stand their ground and fled in full force, with heavy losses of ammunition. After the recent battle in Heshun County, Shanxi Province, the Japanese losses exceeded those of the Pingxingguan campaign, it is said. (25th dispatch)

### Japanese Troops in Linfen Threaten to Invade the West

### Japanese Control of Transportation in North China

Japanese Troops Occupy Railways Within Areas

All Included in Transportation Industry

(Tokyo) The Asia Development Board, holding full authority, has made the final decision regarding the establishment of the "North China Transportation Company." According to Japanese newspaper reports, the company will control all important railways and highways in the areas occupied by Japanese troops in North China. The Pinghan, Jinpu, and Pingsui railways are all included. The management will be handled by personnel dispatched from the South Manchuria Railway. The company will be operated under the Chinese company system with a capital of 300 million Japanese yen, divided into six million shares, each worth 50 yen. The investment ratio is as follows: the Japanese government-run North China Development Company will invest 150 million yen in kind; the "Provisional Government" will invest 30 million yen in cash; and the South Manchuria Railway will invest 120 million yen in cash. The cash to be paid by the "Provisional Government" and the South Manchuria Railway will be fully collected by the end of this fiscal year in late March, with another quarter to be collected in the next fiscal year. All public bus routes in North China and Inner Mongolia will be operated by the company. However, it is still undecided whether the Longhai Railway, which is currently partially occupied by the Japanese army, will also be under the company's control. Usami, the current head of the North China branch of the South Manchuria Railway, will be appointed as the president of the company. Goto, the former director of the Tokyo Municipal Electric Bureau, will be appointed as one of the vice presidents, and another vice president will be a Chinese person. In addition, the Asia Development Board is also drafting plans to establish a Central China Transportation Company. (26th Reuters dispatch)

The Republican government's Foreign Minister, Tal Faruyut, recently came here to talk with the country's President Azaña for a long time. According to sources from this place, Foreign Minister Tal Faruyut reported to the President that the Internal Affairs Conference has decided to accept the British government's recommendation to stop the war in order to negotiate with the Nationalist forces to end the civil war.

(25th Havas dispatch)

According to responsible sources here, Pellier said General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, agreed to allow refugees and political exiles from the country to return to their homeland in a generous spirit, based on humanitarianism.

(25th Havas dispatch)

(London) Key figures from the Church of England and the Free Churches, such as the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Southwark, recently sent a joint letter to Foreign Secretary Halifax, requesting the government to make the Spanish Nationalist government's amnesty of political prisoners a condition for recognition, stating that "based on various reasons," they anticipate that General Franco will use cruel means to retaliate against those who resisted the Nationalist forces. Therefore, if the UK grants recognition and helps him carry out retaliation, it will leave a stain on the conscience of the British people. In short, "if the government can urge the Spanish Nationalist government to issue an amnesty decree, thereby ending the civil war early, and preventing harm to commercial or political interests, it is also a matter of unavoidable responsibility."

### Italy Wants to Woo Poland to Weaken French Influence, Polish Foreign Minister Hosts Banquet for Ciano, France Reiterates Determination to Uphold Territory

Warsaw: After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived here, he recently paid a visit to Prime Minister General Sklagowski, General Smigly-Ritz, Inspector General of the Army Education, and Foreign Minister Pakorski in the afternoon. In the evening, Foreign Minister Pakorski hosted a banquet to entertain him, and both sides made speeches at the table, praising the friendship between Italy and Poland. Foreign Minister Pakorski first traced the course of cooperation between the two countries and then said, "The friendship between our two countries is not only a historical memory. At this time when your country is moving towards the path of development, in addition to striving to strengthen ourselves, our country is willing to maintain and enhance the friendship between our two countries. I would like to take this opportunity to express my humble intentions in a more direct and frank manner." Foreign Minister Ciano immediately replied, "Fascist Italy has a deep friendship with your country. Your country has occupied a lofty position among the major countries of the world due to its unremitting efforts, which is especially sympathized with by Italy. I hope that the results of this trip can further enhance this friendship and sympathy." (25th Havas dispatch)

Warsaw: After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived here, he recently laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the afternoon, but half an hour before that, a large number of citizens held an anti-German demonstration there, shouting "Down with Hitler!" "Down with the German Pigs!" and shouting in French "Long Live the Franco-Polish Alliance!" "Long Live France!" However, this demonstration did not oppose Italy. Many university students also cheered and saluted Ciano in front of the Italian embassy. (25th Havas dispatch)

(Rome) If the relationship between Italy and France in the Mediterranean becomes increasingly tense, what attitude will Poland take? This is the current mystery. Recently, the famous journalist Gaida (who has accompanied Foreign Minister Ciano to Warsaw) published an article in the semi-official Italian newspaper, inferring that "Although Poland has a treaty of alliance with France, it is also a friend of Italy. Its allegiance between France and Italy can be studied based on two points. It is also a standard for determining compliance: historical factors, the first one. Poland is farsighted and strives to become a hero, and its natural interests lie, the first one. To these two, we do not eagerly expect Poland to give a definite and unswerving answer, nor do we hope that Poland will accept any constraints. What we are asking for today is only to understand its current views and attitudes. Foreign Minister Ciano's meeting with Polish Foreign Minister Pakorski has a general nature, and the purpose is threefold: 1. Relations with Germany; 2. Political and economic adjustments in the Danube River basin; 3. Based on Germany's demand for the return of old colonies and the wishes of the Italian nation, establish a new balance in Europe and lay the foundation for peace. In these three, Italy and Poland have common and intricate relationships. In Italy, the basis of the current policy lies in cooperation with Germany in military, political, social, and cultural aspects, and it is also in harmony with the Italian-German Axis everywhere. As far as Poland is concerned, since its reconciliation with Germany, Italy's friendship with Poland has not only increased, but it also believes that Poland's move should be developed. In short, the interests of Germany, Italy, and Poland in the Danube River basin are different but converge to the same goal. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Poland is a preliminary development of the frank cooperation between Germany, Italy, Poland, and the countries in the Danube River basin." (26th Havas dispatch)

Goudan, France: Foreign Minister Pong Lai recently gave a speech here, saying, "The French colonial empire was created by red blood and labor and cannot be interfered with by others. Sovereignty and territory must be fully protected by France and cannot be infringed upon by others." Regarding the relationship between France and Germany, the two sides issued a declaration of peace on December 6 last year, which became the first step for the two countries to increase their friendship. Therefore, there are no longer any border disputes with each other. Regarding the relationship between Britain and France, after British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax delivered speeches in the British upper and lower houses, the friendship and spirit of cooperation between the two countries were further strengthened. As for Spain, France is willing to maintain good neighborly relations with it to avoid the need for competitive border defense on its southern border, so it has decided to send an ambassador to Burgos, Spain. In short, "France's current foreign policy is to increase friendship with all its neighbors." (26th Havas dispatch)

### Japanese Arsenal Greatly Increases Female Workers

### German Authorities Deny Sending Troops to Africa, British Businessmen to Visit Berlin Next Month with a Political Mission

(Berlin) The Manchester Guardian reported that German troops were being sent to Libya, which was denied by the German authorities yesterday, dismissing it as bizarre and absurd. The Havas News Agency's correspondent also failed to find any trace of German troops being sent to Libya or Italian East Africa. They were instructed to have the Havas staff in Italy investigate, but nothing was found. The German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the People's Observer, saying that foreign newspapers have recently been spreading rumors, saying that Hitler had recently sent officers to Abyssinia to train the colonial people to fight, which is like seeing a bow reflected in a cup, unworthy of laughter by those in the know. (Havas News Agency telegram on the 26th)

(London) The Minister of Commerce Stanley and the Overseas Trade Minister Hudson are scheduled to come to Berlin next month to consult with the German authorities and participate in the talks between the British and German industry delegations. This trip carries a political mission, with the intention of promoting Germany's return to the international economic system, so as to develop economic cooperation and complete the work of political appeasement. This is Prime Minister Chamberlain's wish, and he is eager to complete it. According to people in the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street, the Prime Minister believes that the German leader Hitler's speech to the Reichstag on January 30, in which he talked about rapidly increasing exports, has opened a path, and we must take advantage of it to move forward to success. Once the head of the Economic Department of the Foreign Office, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, returns from Berlin on the 27th and reports on the talks, the British Cabinet can use this as a basis to issue detailed instructions to Stanley and Hudson, ordering them to work hard to reach an agreement with Germany on trade methods and foreign commodity prices, and to clearly inform the German authorities that the British export credit guarantee system is efficient. If the negotiations between Britain and Germany fail, it will not be difficult for the German export industry to go bankrupt. Britain's attitude is so frank and will make concessions as a means of appeasement. It is hoped that the German side can also show the same attitude so that an agreement can be reached, and the European situation will be greatly eased. Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy will also achieve full success due to the end of the Spanish Civil War and the conclusion of a commercial agreement between Britain and Germany, and he can bring forward the general election of the House of Commons this autumn. (The term of the current House of Commons must last until 1940) He will ask the people to vote to support the Conservative Party, so that it can solve the unemployment problem with all its strength. The method may often copy part of the original plan of the Labour Party, which is not certain. As for the former Foreign Secretary Eden, it is said that he will rejoin the cabinet before the general election and serve as the Home Secretary. (Havas News Agency telegram on the 25th)

(Paris) International situation is currently commented on by political figures here, saying that the end of the Spanish Civil War may not be the beginning of international cooperation, or it may become a new crisis, with signs of an outbreak in mid-May. To this day, the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact have launched a large-scale movement to transform the world situation. The various conditions that exist are all ready. The major ones are: (1) Since the new government of Spain is a friendly country of the totalitarian countries, these countries occupy a great strategic advantage in Western Europe, and the imperial transportation lines of Britain and France are also threatened in the Atlantic Ocean and the waters of the Balearic Islands. (2) After Japan controls southern China and Hainan Island, it can put pressure on the territories held by Britain and France in Asia. (3) The totalitarian countries are doing their best to encourage Poland, and even instigate the National Army government of Spain to covet certain colonies in North Africa. (4) The Italian government ordered the conscription of a batch of reserve soldiers and sent a large number of troops to Libya in North Africa to increase defenses. (5) The German government mobilized new recruits at all levels in batches for training, and systematically expanded its influence in Southeast Europe in political and economic terms. The totalitarian countries are sharpening their swords in this situation. Fortunately, Britain and France can also systematically clear up the international haze. For example, British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Prime Minister Daladier have repeatedly and firmly stated that the two countries maintain full joint relations. Britain and France are expanding their military equipment with great efforts and purchasing aircraft from the United States to make up for the lack of domestic production. Secondly, they recognized the National Army of Spain as the legitimate government to offset the power held by Germany and Italy in Spain. Thirdly, Germany tried to establish economic hegemony in Eastern Europe, while Britain and France worked hard to resist it in order to maintain the original market. Fourthly, the anti-German tendencies of Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, and Poland are becoming more and more obvious. Among them, the Hungarian government has dissolved the National Socialist Party, and anti-German demonstrations have occurred in Poland for days. Furthermore, the economic activities of Britain and France are even more powerful. The weakness of Germany lies in the fact that its industry has become a war industry. Now, if it wants to change to peacetime industry, it is technically very difficult. The production mechanism must be changed. After the production is adjusted, it is still necessary to find a way out, which cannot be done by Germany alone. Therefore, Britain and France want to negotiate with it on this issue, so as to live in peace with each other. It is hoped that this negotiation can be completed, so as to find a general solution to the various problems that threaten peace. This is the blessing of Europe and the benefit of the world situation. (Havas News Agency telegram on the 25th)

(Havas News Agency telegram on the 25th)

(Paris) It is rumored that most of the Italian overseas Chinese in France have been summoned to return to the country. The authorities concerned have firmly denied this, saying that the Italian government organized a committee in late November last year to be responsible for adjusting and facilitating the return of Italians in various countries to their motherland. There are about 1,000,000 Italian overseas Chinese in France. As of now, only 10,000 have returned to the country. There are 20,000 Italian overseas Chinese in Corsica, France, and only 700 have returned to the country. (Havas News Agency telegram on the 25th)

### Papal Election to Take at Least Four Days

Vatican City The election of a new pope will take at least about four days. At that time, the cardinals will be isolated from the outside world. People in Rome have a lot of speculation about the candidate for the new pope. If the elected person is Italian, the two trends of freedom and conservatism in the church will inevitably conflict. Cardinals Basile, who advocates freedom, and Bichetlani, who advocates conservatism, are both supported. If the Archbishop of Florence, Della Torre, is elected as the new emperor, it will create a legend, but all kinds of speculation may be wrong. It is also possible that the elected person is a lesser-known figure among the cardinals. (Reuters telegram on the 26th)

The American labor union organization has been divided into two factions, one is the American Federation of Labor led by Green, and the other is the Industrial Organizations led by Lewis. They have been confronting each other for a long time. President Roosevelt advocated unifying the national labor union organization in mid-October last year, and Ms. Perkins, the Minister of Labor, also advocated the establishment of a committee to come forward and mediate so that the two factions can reconcile. This committee will be composed of 16 members. In addition to the Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor each sending five representatives, the government will appoint six non-partisan people to participate in it. (Havas News Agency telegram on the 25th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt again issued an appeal to the leaders of the American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Organizations, asking them to release their grievances and reconcile. Political figures commented on this, saying, "The Nermy government wants to improve its relationship with the major industrialists on the one hand, and wants to promote the mutual relationship between labor and capital and the government on the other hand. The reason why the President again issued an application to the two major labor unions is this. However, the Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor have had long-standing differences, and it seems impossible to reconcile. The spiritual impact of this act by the President is more than the actual effect. The President has temporarily abandoned the legislative path and changed to private contact methods to consult with all parties concerned in order to eliminate various obstacles to economic recovery. He then sent an application to the leaders of the American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Organizations. (Regarding the principles of labor union organization, the American Federation of Labor advocates using the profession as the unit, and the Industrial Organizations advocates using the entire factory as the unit). According to news from New York, the President of the American Federation of Labor, Green, has expressed his acceptance of this request from President Roosevelt.

### Guerrilla Team on the Qingpu Road Attacks a Passenger Car, Traitor Attempts to Escape and is Shot Dead, Five Japanese Soldiers Also Captured

Qingpu Correspondence On the 16th, the afternoon passenger car from Qingpu to Shanghai was attacked by guerrillas near Qibao. The driver Wang Xiaohe immediately stopped the car. The guerrillas got on the car to check. Wang Kechang, a pseudo-police bureau inspector, Zhi Yangxiong, a pseudo-business tax director, and a translator (name unknown) got out of the car to escape and were shot dead. Five Japanese soldiers in the car intended to resist, but were eventually captured by the guerrillas, disarmed, and escorted back to the team headquarters. The passengers suffered no losses and arrived in Shanghai safely.

### The False Police Chief of Qingpu Arrested by the Japanese

Qingyong Correspondence: Ye Changyi, the Director of the False Pacification Bureau of the False Jiangsu Province, in order to protect himself and expand his power, used wealth and position as bait to buy off bandits and weapons. The false police, the false police brigade, and the false self-defense corps were all under Ye's control. Last month, after the false Jiangsu Provincial Government appointed Yao to be the false magistrate of Qingpu, Ye engaged in sabotage. Yao learned of this and cried to the Japanese Command in Shanghai, which sent personnel to investigate. Discovering Ye's hidden power, they ordered the commander of the Japanese garrison in Qingpu to place Ye under house arrest, ordering him to hand over his privately held weapons and disband all his forces. In order to save his life, Ye wanted to agree, but his troops were unwilling to disband, so Ye has not yet regained his freedom.

### Danzig Café Notice: "Dogs and Poles Not Allowed"

Danzig: Today, German students staged a demonstration in front of a Polish student hostel, but they were dispersed by the police. The incident stemmed from a notice posted ten days ago at a certain café that Polish students do not frequent, which read: "Dogs and Poles Not Allowed." This was purely a prank by German students, but the Polish students were greatly displeased and held a meeting to discuss countermeasures. The speakers were very passionate. German students then wore Nazi Party uniforms and staged a demonstration to protest against the impassioned speeches of the Polish students. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)

Sexual Hygiene

### Physical Unhealthiness Leads to Numbness and Insensitivity

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School

Frankly speaking, human prosperity cannot exist apart from reproduction. If we want to seek happiness for ourselves and the nation, then we should openly discuss reproduction in order to achieve perfection. Uncivilized and uncultured peoples only know about reproduction and do not know that there is a problem of love involved within reproduction. I can also say that reproduction without love leads to numbness and insensitivity, and even hemiplegia. Only sexual satisfaction and sexual harmony can promote prosperity and evolution. This is undeniable.

Therefore, if you want to generate love in reproduction, you must study the wisdom of love in order to achieve a unified state of beauty.

However, in reality, no matter how profound your wisdom or how smooth your methods of seeking love, if you lack a healthy physique, it is like a headless snake. Moreover, the source of love must be the mutual coordination between husband and wife. These points require abundant energy to succeed. To achieve this kind of expectation, men must maintain chastity before marriage, and sexual energy must not be abused. If a person's energy is dissipated in debauchery for a time, it can cause the youth gland that governs sexual desire to age prematurely, and diseases such as the inability to reproduce will arise as a result, and from then on, it will not be possible to be consistent with the wife's emotional tide.

The union of husband and wife is for the purpose of seeking love. Kidney deficiency is the main reason for hindering the other party's emotional upsurge, so the goal cannot be achieved, so there is no gain in both reproduction and pleasure.

Regarding the progression of this disease, there is a certain procedure. If you usually feel weak and have nocturnal emissions or involuntary ejaculation when seeing a sexually attractive person, you should pay special attention. Or, the local erectile strength is not different, but there is undoubtedly kidney deficiency. If there is no health preservation or indulgence, the erectile strength will be lost and there will be complete impotence. Now that medicine is advancing, endocrine agents of the youth gland have been invented for this disease, such as "Buti Kang," a male animal testicular essence preparation produced in Germany, which is indeed a good medicine for the symptoms. After taking it, the mind is clear, the spirit is invigorated, the complexion is ruddy, the appetite is increased, and the sexual function is very healthy, with no pathological conditions such as kidney deficiency and impotence. It can also promote reproductive function and help the development of sexual organs, so this agent has been praised by countless Chinese and foreign doctors and is happy to introduce it to couples with weak love. This is truly the omnipotence of science.

### The Relationship Between Nocturnal Emission and Neurasthenia

— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany

Nocturnal emission is the most common cause of neurasthenia. However, most types of nocturnal emission are caused by excessive masturbation, so those with a masturbation habit almost all suffer from this problem, because masturbation can directly destroy the human youth gland, causing the seminal vesicle to lose its control. Therefore, the more deficient a person is, the more frequent their nocturnal emissions. The more frequent the nocturnal emissions, the more rapidly the body moves towards weakness. If left untreated, the disease will spread like a flood, and pathological conditions will be found in the three nervous systems of the brain, sex, and spinal cord. Furthermore, when young people are in the midst of development, if they suffer from this kind of worrying disease, it will naturally affect their development.

Therefore, young people should seek treatment as soon as they have nocturnal emissions, and masturbation should be abstained from. Regarding the correction of masturbation, it is necessary to use methods of clearing the mind and reducing desires to improve one's morality. It must be known that masturbation is the most shameful and despicable behavior, which can stain a pure soul, and on the other hand, it is necessary to take the special medicine for nocturnal emission, "Naires Nocturnal Emission Tablets," to stop nocturnal emission. It is necessary not only to stop nocturnal emission in a short period of time, but also to sleep peacefully. If you also supplement with "Buti Kang" at the same time, the function of metabolism will be promoted, and the brain will be strengthened and the spirit will be rejuvenated.

Modern Medicine

### Thorough and Rapid Cure for Leukorrhea

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States

No matter what the disease, treatment should be rapid, and it is absolutely impossible to prolong it and allow the disease to spread, resulting in a difficult-to-treat situation. I have been studying gonorrhea for several decades. When I was studying in the United States, I paid attention to the root cause of this disease. I know deeply that the reproductive power of gonococcus is far greater than that of general inferior bacteria, so it should be treated quickly, so as not to cause other changes. In terms of treatment methods, it is not only necessary to adopt a rapid treatment policy, but also to achieve the words "thorough and rapid." In other words, do not seek frost-like rapid recovery, but seek safe and rapid recovery. The quick recovery of frost often leads to great future troubles, which is equivalent to mistreatment. Only the rapid method of thorough and rapid recovery, which achieves safe and reliable healing and does not have the bad sequelae caused by adverse side effects, can be called a perfect treatment method.

For general leukorrhea patients, two weeks after contracting gonorrhea, the gonococcus will flow into the blood. Although only the symptoms of gonococcus are seen on the surface, internal gonococcus prostatitis, epididymitis, cystitis, and female fallopian tube occlusion often occur. As a result, more than 90% of them are at risk of infertility. Therefore, patients with gonorrhea must adopt perfect and perfect treatment methods, which are necessary conditions for treating gonorrhea.

According to the experience of scholars from various countries and my own experience over the years, only the method of increasing white blood cells and immune antitoxin treatment can cause the blood cells to phagocytize bacteria vigorously, resulting in the gonococcus having nowhere to hide. Only "Kelinnong," invented by Dr. Peter of Germany, can be worthy of the above conditions. This agent is made by mixing refined yellow pigment protein. All acute and superior gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, etc., can be cured by taking the medicine "Kelinnong." Because after taking this medicine for the above-mentioned types of gonorrhea, non-specific anti-gonococcus toxins can be produced to attack the gonococcus, so all gonococcus will be quickly cured and there will never be a recurrence. As for external medicine, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is the best. Patients can wash the urethra at home according to the pictures and instructions to remove the gonococcus on the mucous membrane. Women can use "Kaxuedi Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories to achieve even faster results. Only by using this treatment method to eradicate gonococcus, like wind sweeping away fallen leaves, can we thoroughly kill bacteria, and treatment methods that have side effects are not comparable. This is why it has long won the praise of international medical experts. (According to "Anti-Gonorrhea Water," both Zhongxi Taihe and the two major music rooms sell it.)

Gonorrhea Lecture
— Narrated by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic, No. 9 Sichuan Road at the intersection of Ningbo Road

### New Decision for Treating Leukorrhea!

Cannot be based on empty words. Gonorrhea is a disease that is very difficult to cure completely, so it is useless to rely on empty words. However, in recent years, the treatment of gonorrhea has long abandoned the general outdated treatment methods and replaced them with scientific treatment methods. For example, most people only recognize gonorrhea as a urethral disease. This statement has long been outdated, because the meaning of the word gonorrhea, whether in China or abroad, refers to the phenomenon of a liquid flowing out of the urethra. However, I don't know that this statement is only obtained by relying on the naked eye, so the ancients only focused on the local urethra when treating gonorrhea, and they were inevitably short-sighted. However, later, due to scientific progress, I learned that although gonococcus mostly invades the urethra, its development does not stop at the urethra, because gonococcus is good at fleeing. It is often hidden in the depths of the tissues and can also flee into the blood, muscles and bones, so local surgical treatment and treatment methods that thoroughly kill it are completely scratching the surface and are useless stupid acts. Therefore, most advanced doctors now do not pay much attention to urethral therapy, but regard it as a secondary auxiliary therapy.

Emphasis on internal medicine: Experts from various countries believe that German static electricity therapy is the most effective treatment for gonorrhea. Its electrothermal transmission sterilization power has a large range. It can not only kill gonococcus in the tissues, but also eliminate the deep gonococcus inside the urethra. However, "Kelinnong" in internal medicine has also long been valued by experts. Therefore, the germicidal power of this agent is extremely wide and deep. If it can be used with static electricity therapy, there is a chance of victory in eradicating gonorrhea. This is a particularly effective treatment that is unanimously recognized by gonorrhea experts in modern times. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 numbers will be sent out every day, and each number will only cost 5 jiao.

### Experience in Treating Tuberculosis

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Once a person is unfortunately afflicted with pulmonary tuberculosis, he will first lose the courage to resist the disease demon because he overbelieves that lung disease is a terminal illness. On the contrary, it makes the disease worse day by day, making the treatment lose its due effect, which is a pity. In my more than 20 years of personal experience, I have treated no less than thousands of cases of tuberculosis. Unless the body feels very weak, it can be cured. However, the treatment methods are also making amazing progress from time to time as science is advancing day by day, such as the "One Lung Nare" drug invented by Dr. Mei of Germany, which can indeed be the only internal medicine agent that every tuberculosis patient can protect. All symptoms of chronic cough, hemoptysis, night sweats, and first, second, and third stage other types of lung diseases can be treated by taking it, so "Defei Nare" is the only internal medicine agent for all lung diseases.

### Due to Repeated Incidents in the Shanghai Concessions, Japan Hopes to Increase Police Personnel, Attempting to Expand Its Scope of Duties, Opinions of Spokesperson of the Japanese Naval Ministry

The Tokyo correspondent for the Zi Lin Bao reported on February 23rd: This morning, Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesperson for the Naval Ministry here, told reporters that anti-Japanese terrorism in Shanghai is very rampant. The proper way to deal with the Shanghai situation is to appoint a Japanese person as the Chief Inspector of the Municipal Council's Police Department to completely control the organization. Kanazawa strongly criticized the poor organization and general ineffectiveness of the Police Department, one of its obvious shortcomings being the position of Japanese Assistant Police Commissioner Akagi. Akagi only manages the Japanese police directly under his control and has no real authority to manage general policing as a Deputy Police Commissioner should. The naval spokesperson also sternly criticized the Municipal Council for not paying attention to the overall situation and for not making real efforts to thoroughly handle affairs. According to news reports, an official of the Municipal Council even rashly referred to a certain terrorist case as a love affair between Japanese people. The Japanese Naval Ministry sees the terrorist demonstrations in the Public Concession and the French Concession as inhumane movements carried out by the Chiang regime, the purpose of which is threefold: to attempt to prevent the peace restoration movement that is now broadcasting throughout China, to attempt to strengthen cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and to hope to provoke disputes between Japan and the United Kingdom, etc. The Japanese government has now instructed the Japanese authorities in Shanghai to take a tough stance and take fundamental steps to solve the problem.

Preventing the continued occurrence of direct anti-Japanese political assassinations, one of the most effective and important ways is to increase the number of Japanese personnel in the Public Concession's Police Department and expand their duties, and to place a Japanese police officer in charge of the entire Public Concession Police Department, which is the most reasonable solution. Lieutenant Colonel Takano also strongly criticized the Police Department in this regard, saying that the proportion of Japanese police personnel is much smaller than the proportion of Japanese residents, the Chinese police organization is poor and very ineffective, they have no system of warning lines and no way to communicate or report alarms to each police station, only the general police station can be contacted. Under the current system, Japanese personnel can only serve as Deputy Police Commissioner or Assistant Police Commissioner, but this position can only manage the Japanese police under their control and cannot obtain information from other parts of the Police Department, and cannot manage other police officers such as the Chinese police in an emergency. If the police officers other than the Japanese police do their duty and cooperate effectively with the Japanese police, such terrorist atrocities would never occur repeatedly in the Public Concession, and the perpetrators would never be able to escape to a safe place.

### A Glimpse of the Shanghai-Chongqing Journey via Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guizhou, The Entire Journey Takes About Twenty Days, The Travel Expenses Are More Economical Than by Sea

It has been reported repeatedly that the Shanghai-Chongqing journey via Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guizhou is the most appropriate and economical. The reporter followed this route to Sichuan, but because of the extraordinary period, changes are frequent. The previous reports are not without places that are outdated. Therefore, the reporter will describe the details of this experience later for future reference.

Shanghai-Chongqing Transportation: There are five routes from Shanghai to Chongqing: From Shanghai via Hong Kong, Haiphong, Kunming, Guiyang to Chongqing; From Shanghai via Ningbo or Wenzhou, Jinan, Zhuzhou, Hengyang, Guilin, Liuzhou, Guiyang to Chongqing; From Zhuzhou via Changsha, Changde, Lixian, Shashi to Yichang, take a boat upstream to Chongqing; From Zhuzhou via Changsha, Changde, Yuanling, Luxi, Yongshui, Xiushan, Qianjiang, Pengshui, Nanchuan, Qijiang to Chongqing; From Zhuzhou via Changsha, Changde, Yuanling, Chenxi, Huangxian, Huangping, Guiyang to Chongqing. The route that the reporter took is the last one. The reason for choosing this route over other routes was not a predetermined plan, but a temporary decision due to various problems. However, not going through Hong Kong and Haiphong was decided before departure.

Situation en route: From Shanghai to Wenzhou by sea, the journey is only 24 hours, but due to being stranded on sand in the middle of the journey and not being allowed to enter at night, it was delayed by 12 hours. After arriving in Wenzhou, the inspection was extremely strict. There were as many as 12 classes of Italian soldiers, customs, and tax bureaus. All tax-evading goods were confiscated, and prohibited items were subject to criminal law. Moreover, landing was not allowed without a guarantor. If you are not prepared in advance, you will be at a loss for a while, and some will even return to Shanghai on the original ship. This matter is related to national defense, so you must be prepared carefully. The reporter had credentials, stayed overnight in Wenzhou, and the next morning went to the highway bureau to buy a ticket to Lishui. Before dawn, those waiting were already crowded. The vehicles were limited, and those who arrived later were often disappointed, and some even could not buy a ticket for several days. Hiring someone to wait at the station the day before got a ticket. From Wenzhou, take a small steamer to Wenxi for about four hours, change to a wooden boat for about three hours, and stay overnight in Qingtian. The next morning, take a car for about three hours to Lishui, take the 1:00 PM express bus for about three and a half hours to Jinhua. You can either rest in Jinhua for a day or leave Jinhua on the 8:15 PM train that night. The inspection in Jinhua is also strict, and you may even be searched several times along the way. You may also be questioned in the inn. After the 8:15 train departs, it passes Yiyang in Jiangxi the next morning, and then passes Guixi Dongxiang around noon to Xiangtang near Nanchang, but does not pass Nanchang. If you want to go to Nanchang, change trains here. After leaving Xiangtang, it passes Fengcheng at 3:00 PM, Zhangshuzhen at about 4:00 PM, Qingjiang and Xinyu in the evening, and Fenyi and Yichun at night, and Pingxiang at 5:00 AM the next morning, and arrives at Zhuzhou at 7:30 AM. You could have gone from Zhuzhou via Hengyang to Guilin, but the bombing there was very severe, and the section of the highway from Guilin to Liuzhou was temporarily closed. Therefore, at about 6:00 PM that night, I took the Yuehan train to Changsha, crossed the river to a hotel near the Southwest Highway Bureau station and stayed overnight. The next morning, I took a car to Changde, arriving in Changde in about six and a half hours. Here, you can go north to Shashi or south to Yuanling, which is where I decided on the so-called third and fifth routes. If you go north to Shashi, the vehicles may or may not go, and it is very close to the war zone. Unless you hire a special car with many people, you may have to wait on the way.

Route South: The reporter decided to go south. The next morning, he left Changde by car and arrived in Yuanling after about seven hours and stayed overnight. There are two routes to take here, namely the so-called fourth and fifth routes. After repeated inquiries, I learned that the fourth route is shorter and saves money, but the highway is not good, the vehicles are mostly old and broken, and there are many bandits in the area. Although western Hunan is also a bandit area, there are more vehicles going back and forth, which seems safer. So I decided to take the fifth route. The next morning, I left Yuanling and arrived in western Hunan after about nine hours and stayed overnight. After resting in Huangxian for a day, I left at eight o'clock the next morning and arrived in Huangping at half past five in the afternoon and stayed overnight. I left again at seven o'clock the next morning, passed Huoding at twelve o'clock, and arrived in Guiyang at four o'clock in the afternoon. The next morning, I left Guiyang at seven o'clock and arrived in Zunyi after about seven hours and stayed overnight. The next morning, I left at eight o'clock, passed the rugged and steep Lou Mountain Pass at ten o'clock, arrived in Tongzi at eleven o'clock, passed Diaosi Rock at two o'clock, and arrived at Songkan on the border of Qianchuan in the afternoon to stay overnight. On the third morning, I left Songkan at eight o'clock, arrived in Dongxi at eleven o'clock, arrived in Qijiang at half past two in the afternoon, and arrived at Haitangxi on the south bank of Chongqing at half past seven in the evening.

The mountains are steep and dangerous: The train from Jinhua to Changsha is the safest route. The highway from Qingtian to Lishui is high on the mountainside, with high mountains on one side and deep streams on the other. On the way, I saw a car fall into the stream and drown many people. The section from Huangxian to Guiyang also has high mountains, dangerous roads, and many twists and turns, often two or three kilometers away, turning around a dozen or twenty times. Near Zhenyuan, the car travels in the sea of clouds, as if flying an airplane. The section from Zunyi to Songkan also climbs high mountains repeatedly, winding and twisting, up to more than a hundred times. The sky is slippery and dangerous. There are more accidents on the way. It is accidental after all, and travelers cannot stop because of this. Bandits are the most rampant along the entire route from Zhijiang to Huangping, which are the famous Xiangxi bandits. Now that the authorities of the two provinces are combining suppression and pacification, it seems that they have converged, but it is best for travelers to bring less money and luggage.

Registered ticket purchase: You must buy car awnings every morning before departure. Only Huangxian to Guiyang and Guiyang to Chongqing can buy joint tickets. In Zhejiang and Yuanling to Chongqing, excessive luggage can be purchased with luggage tickets, but Changsha and Changde limit each person to 20 kilograms. Passengers who exceed the limit will be refused to board. Passengers feel the most inconvenienced. The most difficult thing is that there are many people buying tickets and few cars. Some people wait in one place for up to two months without getting a ticket. In Zhejiang, tickets are purchased in order, and when the quota is full, it stops. After Changsha, you must register. At each station, there are hundreds of registrants, and up to thousands of registrants. At the Guiyang station, the registration has reached the end of July, and people in the hotel often take advantage of this to make profits, registering two or three people every day and selling the registered numbers one after another. Each number can be sold for one or two yuan or two or three yuan. This kind of improper profit-making method is the most common in Changde, and passengers are very distressed.

A glimpse of food and accommodation: Food and accommodation are the most inconvenient on the way. The food is inedible, and the sleep is restless. The locals in the interior have always been indifferent to cleanliness and hygiene. The food is rough and the price is expensive, especially in Yuanling and Guiyang. There are fleas, lice, and rats in one room, and in summer, there are bedbugs and mosquitoes. The suffering of traveling is no greater than this. Only the China Travel Service's reception center is the most comfortable, but unfortunately it has not been set up everywhere. Now, for the convenience of travelers, the reporter will record the hotels in various places later. Wenzhou, Garden Hotel on the side of the park, Qingtian, Yunjin Hotel in the city street, Lishui, Liancheng Hotel near the station, Jinhua, China Travel Service Reception Center near the train station, Changsha, Xianggan Hotel near the train station, Lishan Hotel next to the bus station, Changde, Dadao Hotel near the station, Yuanling, Zhuyuan Hotel specially contracted by China Travel Service, near the station, Huangxian, Yongxing Hotel next to the station, Huangping, a hotel specially contracted by China Travel Service, Guiyang, China Travel Service Guiyang Reception Center, Zunyi, Jiaotong Hotel near the station, Songkan, Southwest Hotel near the station.

Total travel expenses: The prices of the entire round of steamships, trains, and bus tickets are listed below: Shanghai to Wenzhou, official cabin 18 yuan, room cabin 12 yuan, general cabin 7 yuan, Wenzhou to Lishui combined bus ticket 3 yuan and 5 jiao, Lishui to Jinhua bus ticket 5 yuan, Jinhua to Zhuzhou train, second class 29 yuan and 2 jiao, sleeper 4 yuan, third class 14 yuan and 6 jiao, sleeper 3 yuan, Zhuzhou to Changsha, second class 1 yuan and 8 jiao, third class 9 jiao, Changsha to Changde, bus ticket 8 yuan and 1 jiao, Changde to Yuanling bus ticket 8 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen, Yuanling to Huangxian bus ticket 10 yuan and 05 jiao, Huangxian to Guiyang bus ticket 17 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen, Guiyang to Chongqing bus ticket 21 yuan and 5 jiao. The number of kilometers traveled by car during the journey is listed below: Wenzhou to Jinhua 147 kilometers, Changsha to Changde 184 kilometers, Changde to Yuanling 197 kilometers, Yuanling to Huangxian 238 kilometers, Huangxian to Guiyang 398 kilometers, Guiyang to Chongqing 488 kilometers.

Precautions: A certificate with a photo of yourself must be carried for inspection, such as those issued by organizations or chambers of commerce and trade unions. A flashlight, wax candle, and galoshes must be carried, otherwise it is often difficult to walk, or there is no light at night, and it is even difficult to move an inch. Even in places with electric lights, they are often turned off completely at 11 o'clock. Food and blankets that can fill one or two days must be carried with you and cannot be made into luggage tickets. Often, the car breaks down in the deep mountains, and there is no fire or inn, so you must stay in the car to avoid freezing and starvation. The reporter stayed in the car for one night, and another person stayed in the car for three nights, both in uninhabited deep mountains or small stations without hotels and restaurants. When buying a ticket and getting on the bus, you must check that your luggage is in the same car, otherwise the person will arrive at a place and the luggage will not arrive, so you must wait, and some have to wait for three to five days and not get the luggage. The food you carry must be packed in a can, not in a paper bag or paper box, to avoid being gnawed by rats. Anyone who must stay in a large city for more than one day should first find a air-raid shelter or a safe area where they can take refuge in case of an air raid, so as to avoid temporary strongholds. The freight station at each station can also take passengers. If you have a little more luggage, you can negotiate with the stationmaster for a seat next to the driver of the freight car, which is best and safer than a passenger car that is not leaking. When getting on the bus, it is best to check the car's license plate number. In case of lost items, it is easier to investigate. If you ask relatives and friends to pick you up by telegram, it is also appropriate to specify the car number in the telegram.

### Western Newspaper Praises: Youth's Spirited Service on the Frontlines

A correspondent for the Mainland News reported that after a recent tour of various frontlines in Central China, they received a letter yesterday (the 24th) stating that hundreds of war service stations organized by the National Government, staffed by thousands of young people from universities and middle schools across the country, are engaged in effective rescue work behind the lines in various parts of China. We visited nine service stations on a highway leading directly to the battlefield in northwestern Hunan. Each station was about eight miles apart, each staffed by five or six young people

volunteering their services. These young people on the road were all members of the Three People's Principles Youth Corps. Each station was equipped with medical supplies, books, magazines, and stoves for cooking porridge and boiling water. Above the entrance, the words "Service Station for Wounded Comrades" were written. To avoid air raids, we departed from our base late at night, carrying biscuits, soap, stationery, and other supplies for the stations, along with several boxes of gasoline and pastries and eggs for our own use. Along the way, we encountered small squads of soldiers and horses, as well as military trucks carrying supplies for the wounded. Shortly after midnight, we arrived at a small town to spend the night. A lantern was still lit in front of the service station in this town. The station occupied two rooms facing the road with the door wide open. We entered and woke up a boy who led us to a farmhouse outside the road, where the young people serving at the station were also staying, about a quarter of a mile from the road. That night, we stayed at a farmhouse. The next morning, we got up at six o'clock, took a breath of fresh air in the fields, and followed the winding paths between the rice paddies to the service station. When we arrived, they had already cooked a pot of porridge and a pot of water. Two square tables were set up with bowls and chopsticks, surrounded by long benches. Several soldiers were eating sesame flatbreads and fried dough sticks for breakfast. The porridge was for the wounded soldiers. As guests, we also got to taste the hot porridge. After introductions, we met the five staff members of the station, all middle school-aged

handsome young men, wearing badges with their names and numbers on them. When we addressed them and distributed the goods, they all stood respectfully. The five young men came from different places. One was eighteen years old, from Guilin. He had not informed his parents, only left a note and a hundred yuan, and secretly left with the war relief service group. We urged him to write a letter home so that his parents would know where their son was. Although the living conditions of the young people were simple, they were all very excited. Their uniforms were stained with mud, and some wore straw sandals like soldiers, but they all had clean faces and bright eyes. They told us that countless young men and women were voluntarily serving the war effort in various parts of the country. We then set off early to visit service stations closer to the front lines. At this time, soldiers and horses were gathered on the road. Two sure signs that we had reached the front lines were the strong smell of stables and the large number of dry and wet military uniforms exposed to the sun. At noon, we arrived at a village where the headquarters of the frontline army was located. One of our party was quite familiar with the commander, so we went to visit him. He was about to leave for an inspection, so he accompanied us. We drove for several miles and then walked along a mountain path to reach the frontline observation post. In front of us was the no man's land of the battlefield. Looking through a high-powered telescope, we could see the Japanese barracks, and the explosions of artillery fire from our side among the Japanese. The valley echoed repeatedly with the sound of shelling. At the same time, Japanese planes were flying overhead, strafing us with machine guns. After returning from the front lines, we visited three other service stations that day. At one place, we were stopped by soldiers shouting. After they checked our passes, they bowed and let us pass. These soldiers were extremely polite, greatly reflecting their good discipline. Roads leading to various major battlefields are lined with similar service stations, all led by Colonel Huang, head of the war zone service corps. Mr. Huang graduated from a university abroad and served as a secretary of the YMCA. He also serves as the secretary-general of the New Life Movement Federation, etc.

### Leqing's Qitou Ocean: Japanese Warships Burn Boats and Plunder Cargo

A dispatch from Wenling: Since the start of the War of Resistance against Japan in the spring of last year, Japanese warships have been stationed or patrolling the seas off the coast of eastern Zhejiang, including the counties of Yuhuan, Leqing, and Yongjia. They occasionally fire on the shore, and merchant ships and fishing boats cannot freely navigate the seas. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the Japanese warships stationed at sea have sailed south one after another. Unexpectedly, recently, several Japanese warships have returned, patrolling the waters off the coast of the Yule counties outside the mouth of the Wenzhou River, and are exclusively engaged in looting merchant ships. According to Lao Da (captain) Ziyao, of a merchant ship that escaped from the sea, three or four Japanese warships are currently stationed in the waters of Qitou Ocean in Leqing County and Dimen Mountain at the junction of Yule, and are patrolling the waters off Huangda'ao, Hengzhi, and outside Kengmen in Yuhuan County from time to time. In the past week, about seven or eight merchant ships have been burned. At that time, three merchant ships sailing with me (Ziyao) were carrying sixty or seventy boxes of mandarin oranges, seventy or eighty pieces of straw mats, and tobacco leaves to Yongjia. The ships passed through Qitou Ocean and were spotted by Japanese warships. They launched speedboats, intercepted and robbed the cargo, and kidnapped young passengers and merchants. Their fate is unknown. The elderly were imprisoned in the ship's cabin, and then the ships were burned. This kind of inhuman act is extremely heartbreaking.

### Jiashan Chinese Troops Approach Suburbs

Correspondence from Jiashan: Since Jiashan fell, the Chinese troops have recovered the nearby towns and villages one after another within the past year, and established a county government in a certain place. In the past half month, the Chinese troops have been active in the suburbs in conjunction with the local people. The Japanese troops have added fortifications near the four gates, and forcibly demolished houses near the East Gate, claiming that they obstruct the line of sight. A few days ago, a unit of the Chinese troops advanced along the waterway and reached the outskirts of the city. At that time, four officials of the puppet government were passing by and were arrested by the Chinese soldiers and taken to the base area for interrogation. A notice from Commander Gu Zong and Zhu Tong was posted in the suburbs, stating that "The people have been under the oppression of the Japanese and puppet regime for a long time and have suffered greatly. This commander and others have long heard of it. In addition to ordering the various troops to continue to carry out mobile warfare in order to annihilate the enemy and avoid future troubles, we also hope that the local people will remain calm and patient in the short term to await the final victory," etc. It is said that after the Japanese and puppet regime discovered the notice, they conducted a thorough and strict search of the nearby people, but none of them uttered a word. Since this incident, the Japanese and puppet regimes have not dared to leave the city lightly, and have advanced the closing time of the city gates.

### Content of Reply to Japanese Side: Concession to Announce Today. US Consulate in Close Communication with Washington. Closures Continue in Alleys with Stricter Inspection of Pedestrians

The Japanese side, citing the continuous occurrence of "terrorist incidents" in the concession and blaming the authorities for insufficient police force, has lodged two protests with the Municipal Council. It is now learned that the Municipal Council's reply to the Japanese side was sent out at 6 pm on Saturday, delivered by the Chairman of the Council, Mr. Fessenden, to the Japanese Consul-General, Mr. Miura. The wording of the reply will be released in full this afternoon (the 27th). It is reported that this reply had been reviewed and approved by the British and American authorities and the Consular Corps beforehand, and the wording was very cautious, indicating that the Municipal Council is now doing its best to take all effective measures to maintain law and order in police work, in order to reduce the occurrence of similar incidents.

US Consul's Tough Stance Towards Japan

According to foreign sources, regarding the Japanese demands, it is said that the US Consulate is taking a particularly tough stance towards Japan. The details of this incident have not been announced by the relevant parties, but the US Consul-General Gauss and many of his staff are still working late at the consulate, communicating frequently with Washington, as was the case during the "January 28th" and "August 13th" Shanghai War incidents.

Alleys Continue to be Sealed Off

In order to maintain security within the concession, the Public Concession suddenly sealed off the alleys on both the north and south sides of Nanjing Road the day before yesterday. Yesterday, it continued to seal off Fuzhou Road (also known as Fourth Road) and the area of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch (commonly known as Changbang Road) at the junction of the British and French concessions. All alleys with exits have been made one-way traffic after one end has been set up with barbed wire. The narrow alleys are only for residents and are not important. Among them, a few alleys have commercial markets, but now they are sealed off, and all customers have to make detours. For example, the Xinhui Le Li and Sanyuanfang on Fuzhou Road leading to Yu Qiaqing Road, which are known for their flower industry, were sealed off yesterday. Xinhui Le Li has to enter and exit from Guangxi Road, and Sanyuanfang has to enter and exit from Shantou Road. Tongwuma Road and Pingdeng Street were also sealed off yesterday. Yesterday, the alleys on Fuzhou Road that had barbed wire set up included Delin Li, Sanyuanfang, Xinhui Le Li, Daxing Li, Fuxiang Li, Tongxing Li, Hele Li, Ping'an Li, Jiu'an Li, Fuxing Li, Yongshun Li, etc. The alleys that were originally one-way and did not have rear alleys that were not sealed off included Chongrang Li, Shijie Li, Donggonghe Li, Xigonghe Li, and Juxing Li. Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, which are several miles long, have many alleys that have been sealed off, but only on the side near the Public Concession up to the Haig Road intersection. The side near the French Concession has not been blocked off.

Police Ordered to Inspect Pedestrians

Starting at 8 am yesterday, the Municipal Council ordered its various police stations, such as the Central Police Station, Laozha Police Station, Xinzha Police Station, Chengdu Road Police Station, Gordon Road Police Station, Putuo Road Police Station, and Jing'an Temple Police Station, to dispatch all Chinese and Western detectives on duty, wearing iron wire vests and carrying pistols and submachine guns, to patrol the roads, and to inspect all public buses, trams, and other suspicious-looking taxis, rickshaws, pedestrians, etc. It is also reported that the Huisi Police Station in the Northern District (i.e., Haining Road Police Station), Dixiwei Road Police Station, Huishan Police Station (i.e., Hongkou Police Station), Jiaxing Road Police Station, Yulin Road Police Station, Tilanqiao Police Station, and Yangshupu Police Station, as well as the Central Police Station of the French Concession (Avenue Joffre), Xujiahui Police Station, Avenue Foch Police Station, Avenue Petain Police Station, Avenue Joffre Police Station, and Laobeimen Police Station, etc., also had similar deployments.

### Chinese Guerilla Unit Parades Armed in Pudong. Unarmed Puppet Police Turn a Blind Eye. Japanese Troops in Gaohashi Dare Not Interfere

According to the French Shanghai Daily, it is said that recently, the armed patrols by the puppet police of the "Shanghai Municipal Government" have been disarmed by the guerilla units in the suburbs, who then use the slogan "Chinese Don't Fight Chinese" to let them go. However, the Japanese side believes that the puppet police are suspected of sending weapons to the guerillas, and has confiscated all the weapons of the "police" in Pudong. Until about 4 pm yesterday (the 25th), a group of about seventy or eighty guerillas suddenly appeared, carrying pistols, hand grenades, light machine guns, etc., and paraded on Peidong Avenue, shouting the slogan "Down with Japanese Imperialism". At that time, the puppet police had no weapons, so they turned a blind eye. What is strange is that a large team of Japanese soldiers was stationed in the Gaohashi area, and there were also several Japanese warships on the river, but they did not dare to move at all, allowing the guerilla unit to parade away. However, the Japanese are so lenient towards the guerillas in their defense zone, but they make many accusations regarding the terrorist incidents in the concession.

### Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire Temporarily Suspend Loading. Cargo Piles Up at Haiphong. Huge Numbers of Vehicles Stranded in Vietnam. The Two Companies Plan to Build New Docks

Since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, China's maritime transportation line has shifted from Guangdong and Hong Kong to Yunnan and Burma, and all export goods from the Guangdong-Yunnan-Vietnam line are transported to Guangdong and Yunnan, and then exported through the overseas routes of Burma and Vietnam. The goods ordered from Europe and the United States are also transported into the interior through these two main lines. Therefore, Rangoon, Haiphong, and Kunming have replaced Guangzhou and Hong Kong in function. The British shipping companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire have opened direct shipping lines from Shanghai to Haiphong to facilitate passenger and cargo transportation. The cargo warehouses and lighter warehouses in Haiphong have been filled with goods, and a large number of vehicles are stranded in Vietnam. Therefore, the Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire ships sailing between Shanghai and Haiphong have temporarily suspended loading cargo. They will resume after the cargo piled up in Haiphong is cleared. It is also heard that Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire are preparing to build new cargo docks in Haiphong.

### Temporary Measures for Opium Quit Certificates in Extraordinary Times. Issuance of Poverty Licenses, Travel Permits, etc. Free of Charge to Avoid Difficulties

The Opium Prohibition Committee has drafted temporary measures for the use of opium quit certificates in extraordinary times, and submitted them to the Ministry of Interior for approval and then to the Executive Yuan for record. The measures are recorded as follows: Article 1: In extraordinary times, in order to avoid difficulties in provinces and cities receiving and transporting opium quit certificates, these measures are specially formulated. Article 2: The opium quit certificates and opium addict purchase count tables that provinces and cities should receive from the Opium Prohibition Committee of the Ministry of Interior according to regulations shall be temporarily made and issued locally by the provincial and municipal governments according to the fixed format. Article 3: The "Opium Quit Certificates" temporarily made by the provincial and municipal governments shall be valid only after being affixed with special stamps made by the Opium Prohibition Committee of the Ministry of Interior. However, the opium addict purchase count table shall not be affixed with stamps. Article 4: All free poverty licenses and travel permits that are not charged shall be affixed with stamps, and the Opium Prohibition Committee of the Ministry of Interior shall issue and affix them free of charge. Article 5: The special stamps for opium quit certificates are divided into the following four types: 1. Red: for ordinary opium quit licenses; 2. Blue: for opium quit licenses for the poor; 3. Green: for opium quit licenses for the indigent; 4. Ochre: for opium addict travel permits. Article 6: The provincial and municipal governments shall temporarily make the opium quit certificates and retain half of the one-fifth certificate fee originally paid to the Opium Prohibition Committee of the Ministry of Interior as the cost of printing the certificates, which shall still be included in the opium prohibition budget for unified collection and expenditure. The remaining half shall be paid to the Opium Prohibition Committee of the Ministry of Interior as the cost of the stamps. Article 7: The stamps affixed to the opium quit certificates shall be stamped with a cancellation mark of a different color at the adhesive opening. Article 8: If the opium quit certificate stamps are forged or peeled off and re-glued, they shall be punished according to law. Article 9: These measures shall be implemented in extraordinary times and abolished when the situation returns to normal. Article 10: These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval.

### Zhejiang Salt Smuggling Completed. Totaling 3.82 Million Dan. National Treasury Revenue Increased by More Than 30 Million

In order to prevent the salt produced in eastern Zhejiang from being used by the enemy and to alleviate the salt shortage panic in Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan, our military authorities changed the wartime food salt transportation office in Zhejiang Province to the wartime food salt collection and transportation office in Zhejiang District in July last year, and the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to jointly operate with Zhejiang Province to actively smuggle Zhejiang salt. As of last month, the main salt production and stored salt in Zhejiang Province have been completely transported, totaling 3.82 million dan. It is said that in addition to the central assistance funds that Zhejiang Province should receive, the foreign sales surcharges and provincial treasury have collected more than 1.1 million yuan. After the salt is released from the field, the Ministry of Finance can collect an average of 10 yuan in salt tax per dan, and the national treasury has increased its salt tax revenue by 38.2 million yuan. It is also said that there is usually no such sales volume for this salt, and there is no salt tax revenue. At the same time, it is difficult for salt farmers to obtain this huge amount of money. If it is used by the enemy, the government and the salt farmers will suffer great losses. Therefore, the smuggling of salt in eastern Zhejiang this time was able to be transported out in the shortest possible time. Whether it is the government or the salt farmers, the receipt of this huge amount of money is indeed a major harvest in the midst of the War of Resistance.

### Ningbo Navigation Administration Office Newly Revised: Measures for Issuing Licenses to Steamships. Implemented from March 1st, Ordered All Ships to Comply. Moufu, De Ping and Other Ships Have Been Surveyed

The Ningbo Navigation Administration Office, directly under the Ministry of Communications, has recently revised the measures for issuing import and export permits and inner harbor visa slips for steamships, which will be implemented from March 1st. The Ningbo Shipping Association has been ordered to inform the shipping companies to comply. Moufu, Deping, and other ships have been surveyed by the Navigation Administration Bureau and are allowed to sail directly between Shanghai and Ningbo on a regular basis. The remaining ships are still temporarily operating. There were no Japanese reconnaissance aircraft in Ningbo the day before yesterday. The details are as follows:

Navigation Office Notifies Shipping Companies

The Ningbo Navigation Administration Office, directly under the Ministry of Communications, has issued Notice No. 102 to the Ningbo Shipping Association, ordering all shipping companies to comply with the three measures for issuing import and export permits and two-port visa slips for ships. The original text states: "This office will issue import and export permits and inner harbor visa slips for steamships starting from March 1st. In addition to notifying separately, we are sending you a copy of the temporary measures for issuing permits and visa slips, and asking you to comply."

Measures for Issuing Import and Export Permits

Temporary Measures for Issuing Import and Export Permits and Inner Harbor Visa Slips for Steamships Entering and Exiting the Ningbo Jiang Estuary by the Ningbo Navigation Administration Office, directly under the Ministry of Communications. These measures are drafted in accordance with Article 2 of the Measures for Restricting Navigation in Coastal Ports promulgated by the Military Commission under the Ministry of Communications. Steamships operating regularly between Ningbo and inner ports (such as Dinghai and Shipu) (such as Tianbao and Libao) must present the inner harbor visa slip issued by this office to the Zhejiang Customs for inspection and clearance when entering and exiting. (The visa slip shall be kept by the ships themselves after presentation). Steamships operating between Ningbo and commercial ports or important ports (such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Wenzhou, and Haimen) shall be handled in accordance with the following regulations: Steamships entering the port, starting from March 1st of the 28th year, shall apply to this office in advance for the issuance of an import permit when entering the port for the first time, and then submit it to the Ningbo Garrison Command to order the Zhenhai police teams to check and release it. For each subsequent entry, an import permit issued by this office must be obtained in advance and stored on the ship, and only after it has been checked and collected by the Zhenhai police teams will it be allowed to sail. In special circumstances where steamships cannot complete the procedures in time to enter the port, they may consult with the Ningbo Garrison Command to determine how to handle them. Steamships exiting the port, starting from March 1st of the 28th year, must first purchase an export permit issued by this office each time they exit the port, present it to the Zhejiang Customs for inspection and clearance, and then present it to the Ningbo Martial Law Inspection Office for inspection, collection, and release. Note: All procedures for applying for import and export permits and inner harbor visa slips for steamships can be handled with this office.

Moufu and Other Ships Have Been Surveyed

Since the Headquarters of the × Army Group issued the revised measures for navigation in eastern Zhejiang to adjust navigation in eastern Zhejiang, it has been stipulated that the ships operating on each line must apply to the Ningbo and Wenzhou Navigation Administration Offices for measurement, inspection, and issuance of certificates before they are allowed to operate. Before these procedures are completed, all ships that have been approved for registration may temporarily maintain their original status. It is now learned that Moufu, Deping, Tangsai, and Meida, which operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, have been measured and considered qualified by the Navigation Administration Office. Those operating on the Wenzhou line, such as Tanglu, Tangbei, Meifa, and Baolili, have also been measured. As for the others that have not been inspected and operate on the Shanghai-rain line, they are still temporary in nature.

No Japanese Aircraft in Eastern Zhejiang the Day Before Yesterday

It was also reported yesterday that Japanese aircraft flew to Ningbo, Zhuji, and Jinhua the day before yesterday for reconnaissance. The reporter of the Modern News inquired about it with the crew of the Moufu ship, which had just arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday morning (according to them, the ship left Ningbo at about 4 pm the day before yesterday). According to them, five Japanese aircraft dropped bombs in Zhenhai and Linhai on the 22nd, but Ningbo did not see any Japanese aircraft on the 26th (i.e., the day before yesterday). Therefore, what was reported in the Shanghai newspaper may be misinformation. The situation at the estuary has gradually recovered, and foreign ships are planning to resume navigation to maintain their business.

### Interpretation of Partnership Trademark Registration: Even if the Partner Serving as Manager Withdraws from the Partnership, It Does Not Affect the Exclusive Right to Use the Trademark

The Executive Yuan previously submitted a report from the Ministry of Industry stating that a partnership firm uses a trademark registered in the name of the partner serving as manager. If the partner withdraws from the partnership, whether the trademark should be transferred for registration is a matter of doubt. After consulting the Judicial Yuan for interpretation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was instructed to take note. The Executive Yuan's order to the Ministry of Economic Affairs is recorded as follows:

The Ministry of Industry's letter No. 53835 from March 25th of the 26th year, requesting a consultation on the interpretation of the provisions of the Trademark Law, has been consulted by the Judicial Yuan for interpretation and instructed to file for record. Now, the Judicial Yuan's letter No. 1836 from January 19th of the 28th year states: "It has been decided by the Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference of this Yuan that if a trademark used by a partnership firm was originally applied for registration by the partner serving as manager in the name of the manager, if the partner withdraws from the partnership, transfers shares to others, and another partner serves as manager, it is different from transferring the business. Since it does not affect the exclusive right to use the trademark, it does not apply to the provisions of the Trademark Law regarding transfer of registration. A corresponding reply is sent for your reference and instruction." In view of this, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is hereby ordered to take note. This order.

### Power Company Raises Prices Again. Citizens' Association Requests Negotiations for Cancellation. Repeated Price Increases Are Not Affordable for Citizens and Contradict the Purpose of Public Utilities

The 35th District Branch of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation has written to the City Federation regarding the increase in electricity prices by the power company, stating: "We are writing to inform you that we have read in the newspaper that the power company has announced that it will increase electricity prices again starting from March 1st, and the Municipal Council's Finance Committee has agreed. It will increase the price by 10% again as before. The Public Concession Power Company once used the excuse of inconsistent company revenue and expenditure to intend to increase electricity prices by 32.5% before the war. Later, the City Federation, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, and the City Chamber of Commerce, etc., insisted on opposing it because the citizens could not afford it. The Concession authorities also feared that it would provoke incidents and temporarily suspended the company's request to increase electricity prices. When the Shanghai War broke out, the company took the opportunity to request an increase in prices, and the Municipal Council approved it, increasing it by 22.5%. The remaining 10% would be reviewed and seized again after six months. Now that the deadline has expired, the company has requested that the unadded % be added again, and the Municipal Council has again expressed its agreement to uniformly increase it starting from March 1st, for a total of 32.5%. In fact, only daily necessities stores have been slightly prosperous after the war, and it is undeniable that citizens are experiencing economic difficulties due to the high cost of living. This time, the power company is disregarding the difficulties of the times and raising prices again, which is not affordable for citizens in extraordinary times and is contrary to the purpose of public utilities to facilitate the public. Therefore, we are writing to request that the City Federation, the Taxpayers' Association, and the City Chamber of Commerce work together to strive for negotiations to cancel the price increase, so as to lighten the burden on citizens and maintain the market. We are eagerly looking forward to it."

### The 50th Scout Troop Service Report: 630,000 Kilometers Traveled, Escorting Over 70,000 Soldiers and Civilians

After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, some members of the 50th Scout Troop of this city immediately served in the Red Cross, transporting and providing first aid. After the National Army moved west, they followed to the interior to continue their service. By the end of last year, they had been working for sixteen months. Now, as the Red Cross is holding an executive and supervisory committee meeting in Hong Kong, the troop has submitted a work report for the Red Cross to review. Excerpts are as follows:

Work Situation: The first phase of service was in Shanghai, from August 13, 1937, to November 8, 1937, a total of three months. Starting from September 25th, they were responsible for the wounded soldier distribution station at the Foreign Affairs Building. On October 28th, when the National Army was moving to new positions, roads and bridges were bombed and severely damaged, making rescue work impossible. The troop then organized a "Pathfinding First Aid Team" to venture out and rescue wounded soldiers. The service involved a total of 60 people, covering more than ten counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, such as Wusong, Baoshan, the city center, North Sichuan Road, Qiujiang Wharf, Jiangwan, Dachang, Miaohang, Gujiazhai, Luodian, Liuhang, Liuhe, Yanghang, Yuepu, Zhenru, Luoyang Bridge, Nanxiang, Jiading, Xinzhuang, Qibao, Qingpu, Taicang, Kunshan, Changshu, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and other places, with 1,871 deployments, covering 93,556 kilometers, and rescuing 62,007 wounded soldiers and refugees. The second phase was in the interior, from November 9, 1937, to the end of 1938, a total of twelve months. Their work included: moving west with the army from Shanghai, via Suzhou to Nanjing, then from Nanjing to Changsha, reaching Hankou, moving medical supplies and staff, and simultaneously transporting wounded soldiers from Shanghai to eastern Zhejiang; from Hankou to Changsha, they began long-distance journeys to the north, south, east, and west, dispatching personnel, transporting wounded soldiers, and transporting medical materials and supplies; they were responsible for front-line rescue work and transporting wounded soldiers on the Nanxun Line; after the Changsha fire, they moved to Qiyang to prepare for later services. The staff consisted of 40 people, covering thirteen provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Yunnan, more than eighty counties, and more than one hundred locations, covering 476,401 kilometers, with 1,081 deployments, transporting 14,144 pieces of medicine, and rescuing and transporting 11,756 wounded soldiers, villagers, and service personnel. In the above two phases, the total distance traveled was 569,957 kilometers, transporting 14,144 items, and rescuing 73,763 soldiers and civilians.

Martyred Members: A total of three members of the troop were martyred while participating in the service: He Guoshou, 22 years old, an employee of the Hesheng Foreign Firm in Shanghai, reported to the troop for service at 1:00 PM on August 22, 1937, and was killed by a bomb near the Sincere Company. He had an elderly mother at home and was unmarried. Du Xiangxian, 25 years old, an employee of the Ellis Foreign Firm in Shanghai, overworked in Shanghai, became ill due to overwork, and developed typhoid fever. He died at the Baolong Hospital on October 31, 1937. He had an elderly mother at home, one older brother, two younger sisters, and was unmarried. Cang Chengquan, 22 years old, an employee of the Chunsheng Sports Equipment Company in Shanghai, contracted malaria while traveling on official business in Guiyang and died at the Guiyang Central Hospital on December 31, 1938. He had an elderly father at home, one older brother, and was unmarried. In addition, eighteen members of the troop were injured.

### Invitation Card Exhibition: Rules for Submission Established

The fundraising exhibition of ancient and modern invitation cards to aid the needy, initiated by prominent figures in this city such as Lin Kanghou, Xu Jiyin, and Zhou Bangjun, has been reported in various newspapers. It is now learned that the association has recently received support from famous figures in Shanghai, such as Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Chu Minyi, Xu Xiaochu, Fang Jiaobo, and Ge Fuchu, making progress even smoother. The association has now established the following rules for open submission: The submission should focus on invitation cards for social gatherings, weddings, funerals, and celebrations. Similar invitation cards may also be included. The selection of invitation cards for the exhibition will be based on four criteria: A. Perfect wording; B. Relevant historical documents; C. Novel style; D. Excellent printing. Ordinary submissions will be kept and the name of the donor will be acknowledged, but they will not be returned. If there are fine pieces or if they need to be returned, the association can be notified in advance and a receipt will be issued. After the exhibition, the original items will be returned. For precious submissions or a large number of items, a letter can be sent to notify the association, and an appropriate person will be sent to collect them in person. Those who wish to submit are requested to send them directly to the preparatory office of the association at Yichang Money Exchange in Xingren Lane, Ningbo Road, in the Public Concession, and to various collection points. Once a sufficient number of items has been collected, a location will be selected and the exhibition will be open to the public. All proceeds from ticket sales will be used to aid those in need. If all sectors can enthusiastically support and submit items as soon as possible, the exhibition can be held sooner, and those in need can benefit earlier. In the future, when the meeting is held, there will be a special publication of the invitation card exhibition, containing texts and pictures of invitation card research, which will be a new approach and will make great contributions to social etiquette and Chinese literature.

### Ning Shi Creditors' Group: Creditors' Meeting Held; Those Who Have Not Participated Can Still Register

The Shanghai Ningbo Industrial Bank creditors' group held its first creditors' meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Siming Building. More than 100 people attended, including Wang Changsheng. Five resolutions were passed, and Zou Chunrong, Wang Changsheng, Ge Hecai, Wu Guozhu, and nine others were elected as creditors' representatives to be responsible for presiding over the meeting. It is also reported that those who have not yet participated can still register with the group.

### Money Shops Begin Sending Account Books and Making Loans, Adopting a Guarantee System; Domestic Goods Factories and Businesses Given Priority; Loans Issued Last Year Have All Been Recovered

The Shanghai Money Trade Association's 41 member shops opened on the 23rd of this month. The association held an executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the opening situation of each shop, and to pass resolutions on reorganizing the member money shops and replacing representatives. The annual meeting of the Beishi Guild Hall will be held on March 9th. According to the New Voice News reporter's inquiries, money shops have always emphasized credit when making loans. However, due to the abnormal development of various industries in the Shanghai concession area, all the loans issued last year have been recovered. In order to support the development of domestic goods businesses and factories, the account books of domestic goods factories and businesses will be sent out starting today. However, the post-war method will still be followed, and a guarantee system will be adopted for all loans, and the amount of overdrafts will be appropriately limited.

### Foreigners Evacuated from Guling Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Tonight; 55 Still Remaining on the Mountain; Japanese Side Notified of Concentrated Locations

The Continental News reports that, according to Japanese sources in this city last night (the 25th), a Japanese transport ship carrying 47 foreigners from Guling has sailed from Jiujiang and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning (the 27th). The Japanese side has received direct telegraph reports from the ship regarding its progress. Unless there are unexpected delays, it is expected to dock not far from Wusong tomorrow evening (i.e., tonight). It is reported that the ship left Jiujiang early Thursday morning and docked in Nanjing that day. Reliable sources here learned last night that 55 foreigners are still remaining on Guling, determined not to leave the mountain under any circumstances. For protection, they have concentrated in two locations. It is reported that the Japanese authorities have been notified of the precise locations of these two sites. Among the 55 foreigners remaining on the mountain, eight are disabled and unable to move, and eighteen are elderly, over seventy years old. Of these 55 people, 12 are American citizens and seven are Swedish citizens. They have left their residences and concentrated at the American Boys' School, but the school is in a dangerous location, as it is less than 100 yards from the Chinese government building. The 37 British citizens remaining on Guling have left their residences and concentrated in a hotel about one and a half li from the American Boys' School. The third concentration camp in Jiujiang is located in the Chinese refugee shelter in the Methodist Church Village. It is reported that there are hundreds of poor Chinese refugees inside. The establishment of this shelter has also been notified to the Japanese side. All three concentration camps have large white signs and foreign flags, which are said to be clearly visible from the air. The person in charge of the refugee shelter is Dr. Liepeh, who says he will do his best to serve the welfare of those under his care. There are no major problems with the supply of goods to Guling for the time being. There are currently sufficient rice and canned goods to last for half a year, but the supply of meat, vegetables, and eggs is dwindling. It is noted that the previous report that there were only 65 foreigners in Guling was inaccurate. There are 55 people remaining on the mountain, and 47 have been evacuated, bringing the total to 102.

### Sand and Gravel Association Holds Executive and Supervisory Meeting; Firmly Opposes Any Form of Monopoly; Public Associations Unanimously Express Support

After the Sand and Gravel Association opposed Wan Tai's monopolistic operations, the association held a temporary joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the association's headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Lu Xiaozuo and Li Zefu. Lu Xiaozuo was elected as temporary chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, and then the following resolutions were discussed: Resolutely oppose any form of monopolistic behavior; resolution passed. A case involving non-members Zhou and Wang colluding with Wan Tai Company to organize the Sijiao Yellow Sand Joint Transport Company, attempting to undermine the operations of all fellow traders: resolution passed, notify fellow traders to unanimously stop barging and refuse to trade. A case involving workers Fang Jinxiang and others being forced to be convicted, requesting assistance from the association: resolution passed, assistance approved. The association received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in reply, stating: In response to your letter regarding the Wan Tai Company, we are aware of the matter. If your association has any feasible measures, this association will provide assistance to the extent possible. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession replied, stating: In response to your letter, we have received your request for assistance regarding the monopoly and control of the Wan Tai Sand and Gravel Company. We will do our best within the scope of our capabilities.

### Japanese Increase Troops on the Coast of Northern Jiangsu; War Imminent; Songji Port and Other Ports Sealed Off by Chinese Army; Tense Situation Along the Coast, Sluggish Business for All Ships

Since elite troops of the Chinese army were successively transferred to Tongzhou, Rugao, Chongming, Qidong, and Haimen counties in northern Jiangsu to deploy along the coast, the Japanese side has been greatly alarmed. In recent days, they have dispatched more than 600 Japanese troops to the Qinglonggang and Futong Tianshenggang areas, and have built fortifications, creating a very tense situation. War is imminent, and business along the river has also suddenly become sluggish. The following is a report from a Modern News reporter on various situations:

Strong Chinese Military Strength

The guerrilla units of the five counties of Nantong, Rugao, Chongming, Qidong, and Haimen, since being actively reorganized and trained by the 24th Group Army of the Second War Zone, have become a strong force, estimated to total between 70,000 and 90,000 people. They are distributed in various port areas and important strongholds in the inland areas of each county. The troops along the coast are the most elite, with several field guns and small steel cannons in each regiment, making them a very strong force. Commander-in-chief Li Mingyang went to a certain location last week to convene the generals of each county and instruct them on future policies. All the strong men trained in the previous counties have enlisted one after another and been transferred to a certain location to undergo various academic training. Prepare the reserve team,

Japanese Reinforcements and Deployment

According to a person who came from Tongzhou to the Modern News reporter last night, since the Chinese army transferred troops to the coast of each county, the Japanese troops originally stationed in Tianshenggang, Dashenggang, and Haimen Qinglonggang in Tongzhou were greatly alarmed. The number of naval marines sent from Shanghai to various ports for deployment was about 600. Two Japanese ships and forty or fifty speedboats are docked outside the port of Tianshenggang. A small gunboat is docked at Qinglonggang. Observing the reinforcements, they appear listless and not in good spirits, with few strong men, as if they had been recently transferred back from the front lines for recuperation. Japanese amphibious aircraft fly in groups of three or five over the coastal sky every day, conducting reconnaissance.

Various Shallow Ports Have Been Blockaded

The ports in the northern Jiangsu area, from Haimen to Rugao, include Songji Port, Niuhong Port, Jianji Port, Hetong Port, Qinglonggang, Xin Port, Lingdian Port, Sanhe Port, Dong No. 1 to No. 3 Ports. Further south are Nantong's Dashenggang, Tianshenggang, Xin Port, and the various ports of Chongming Island. Among them, the beaches of Songji Port and Xin Port are closer to the navigable waterways, making it easier for Japanese speedboats to land. Moreover, Japanese troops have repeatedly landed in the past, always coming through these two ports. Therefore, the Chinese army, fearing that the Japanese side would follow the old route to land again, specifically implemented a blockade of each port a few days ago to block the path. In recent days, the situation along the coast has been very tense, and there is a sense of impending war. Residents are moving away one after another, and the freight volume of ships traveling the Beisha Line has been sluggish, so the number of trips has been reduced to observe the development of the situation.

### Current Situation in Tianjin Under Japanese Violence

According to a merchant who just came to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday, since the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese side has been acting recklessly in the North China area, not only arbitrarily oppressing the Chinese people, but also being extremely hostile to foreigners residing in Tianjin and Pingjin. Especially to the British and French expatriates, they are also severely oppressed. All foreign commercial ships entering and leaving must first dock at the Japanese concession wharf, undergo various inspections, and then be allowed to sail into the concession wharves of the respective countries to load and unload cargo and passengers. The areas with heavy traffic between the various national concessions and the Chinese area in Tianjin used to have an international iron bridge built to facilitate communication. However, the Japanese side seized the rights and interests of foreigners and, in order to indirectly blockade the transportation between the Chinese and foreign concessions, specifically built an iron bridge behind the Zhongyuan Company last autumn, which is expected to be completed next month. In the future, after the completion of the bridge, the concessions of various countries in Tianjin will be equivalent to dead places. According to the merchant, although the people in North China are living under the tyranny of the Japanese, just like slaves, they have a deep sense of national identity and their patriotic sentiments are very high. The only pity is that the class system of the people in the north has not yet been eliminated. However, young students and workers, leaving their homes or abandoning their wives and children, are flocking south to participate in the war of resistance, which is very enthusiastic.

### Yao Cotton Transported to Shanghai; Totaling More Than 88,000 Packages

Since permission was granted by the Zhejiang authorities to export Yao cotton, the number of packages that have arrived in Shanghai successively loaded on Mahler and other ships is 16,000. This Yao cotton is handled by the British-owned United Cotton Mill and Chongxin Cotton Mill. In addition to what has already arrived in Shanghai, there are still 62,216 packages of Yao cotton (16 kilograms per package) that can be loaded in Shanghai within days.

### Restrictions on German Jewish Refugees Coming to Shanghai; Passports Not Approved by the Chinese Side Will Not Be Allowed to Depart for Shanghai

The Continental News reports that rumors are circulating that 12,000 German Jews will arrive in Shanghai before September. Yesterday (the 25th), according to well-informed sources in this city who have close contact with the German Jewish situation, the number will not be so large, but there is a possibility that about 3,000 refugees will arrive. It is now more difficult for immigrants to come to Shanghai from Germany than before. First, they must produce a passport approved by the Chinese side, and then prove that their coming to Shanghai is to find employment or that they have relatives and friends in Shanghai to take care of them before they are allowed to leave. It is reported that Germany will now no longer allow refugees who rely on public assistance to come to Shanghai from Germany, but those who have already booked their berths, about 3,000 people, will be allowed to depart. The refugee situation in Shanghai is not yet causing anxiety, as the housing and funds for the immigrants are still ample. However, if funds are not continuously received, this situation will deteriorate within a month. Currently, immigrants are housed in single men's residences on Huade Road, family residences on Huishan Road, and Riverside Mansion, in addition to those who live in private residences or with friends. A small number also live in new houses on Huasheng Road. These houses are planned to be converted into a hospital, which will be run by doctors and nurses from among the refugees. If the hospital is established according to the current plan, in addition to treating Jewish immigrants, it will also serve the outside world to a large extent.

### The "Puppet City" is Completely Exhausted; The Puppet Officials are Uneasy About the Lack of Funds for the Government Next Month

The puppet city government has been in a state of panic for days, studying the so-called "terrorist" cases, waving flags and shouting, so that the internal puppet officials, big and small, can focus their attention on these incidents, in order to cover up the danger that the puppet "government" itself is facing economic collapse and to suppress future more serious "terrorist" incidents. Since the puppet "Reformed Government" was jealous of the puppet "city government's" huge monthly "miscellaneous tax" revenue, it used its "superior" status to force Chuan Xiaonong to cancel 38 kinds of puppet "consumption taxes" starting in February, the puppet "government" suffered direct losses of more than 500,000 gold every month. This puppet "government" regarded it as the main artery of economic sources,

Once severed, it could have put the puppet "government" to death. Because apart from these 38 kinds of "consumption taxes," there were only limited puppet housing donations in a corner of Pudong along the coast, and the puppet "vehicle donations" in Nanshi, Pudong, and Huxi, as well as the puppet "ship donations" in the Huangpu River. The former is of a "seasonal donation" nature, and the latter two are of a "annual donation" nature, with very little income. However, the puppet Reformed Government

Once Promised Every Month

To Subsidize 400,000 Yuan, the remaining insufficient amount, the puppet "city government" also planned to levy puppet "land tax" and puppet "business tax" to make up for it. Now February is coming to an end, and the 400,000 yuan subsidy from the puppet "Reformed Government" has proven to be a mere lip service and there is no hope. The two new puppet "taxes" are difficult to collect due to insufficient preparation, so the puppet "government" is doomed

Has Reached Bankruptcy

State, although the puppet officials' "salaries" for February can be barely maintained by patching together, there is no funding for the puppet "expenses" next month. Although various methods are used to cut staff, reduce salaries, and abolish redundant "agencies," there is still no remedy. Chuan Xiaonong has been exhausted by this difficult problem, fearing that the puppet officials will be unwilling to work and cause a disturbance. Therefore, he is using the "terrorist" incident as an excuse to make a big fuss to cover up his economic panic. But everyone expects Chuan's move to be a futile attempt to cover up the truth, because puppet officials are not kind, and cannot be deceived by a single trick.

### U.S. Shortwave Radio Station to Broadcast to the Far East Starting Next Month; Broadcasts to Begin on March 2nd; Shanghai, Chongqing, and Other Places Can Receive

The latest shortwave radio station on Treasure Island in the United States, call sign W6XBE, once broadcast to Shanghai on the opening day of the World's Fair on the 18th of this month. It then stopped broadcasting because the equipment still needed to be adjusted. It is now learned that the radio station will resume broadcasting to the east as usual starting on March 2nd. The U.S. time is from 4:00 AM to 7:00 AM, and the Shanghai time is from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM. The radio station is 15.230 or 9.530 kHz, and it arrives in Shanghai, or even London, Berlin, and other places, via the United States and South America. Its sound is very loud and clear. Last time, when the radio station was test broadcasting to the Far East, Chongqing, Nanjing, Tianjin, and other places could receive it.

### Difficult Sources, Raw Lacquer and Pigments Prices Rise; Affected by the Fall of Yuehan and Foreign Exchange Contraction

The raw lacquer and pigments sold in this city are usually purchased from the mainland and foreign countries and brought to Shanghai for sale. Since the fall of Yuehan, the source of raw lacquer has been cut off, and the price of pigments has continued to rise due to foreign exchange contraction and time-consuming transportation. The price of raw lacquer had already risen to 280 yuan per dan, and now it has risen to 320 yuan, an increase of 15%. A pound of German-made iron can of pigment used to sell for 2 yuan and 40 cents, but it has risen to 3 yuan and 20 cents, an increase of more than 30%.

### Japanese Depreciate the Value of Legal Tender; Counterfeit Money is Everywhere in North China; Although the Value of Legal Tender is Depressed, It Has Actually Increased in Value; North China Banks Send Personnel to Shanghai to Report

New Voice News reports that since the implementation of our country's legal tender policy, it has been deeply trusted by Chinese and foreign people due to its sufficient reserves. After the Japanese puppets failed to obtain foreign exchange by using "joint banknotes," they forcibly depreciated the value of legal tender, and Chinese and foreign banks were pressured. The North China banking community has sent personnel to Shanghai to report everything. Details are as follows:

Counterfeit Money is Everywhere

Since the fall of Pingjin, the puppet organization in Peiping established the "China Joint Reserve Bank" and issued banknotes without any guarantee, forcing them to circulate in the market. As of January 10 this year, the amount in circulation was about 185 million yuan. In addition, the unguaranteed banknotes issued by the "Manchurian Central Bank" and the "Jidong Bank" circulating in the two cities of Pingjin amounted to about 16 million yuan. Moreover, the Hebei Provincial Bank further expanded its issuance to 58 million yuan. Recently, the "Joint Reserve Bank" also issued three kinds of small-denomination non-convertible banknotes with denominations of five cents, one cent, and half a cent. The scope of circulation is extremely wide, and the amount issued is even unlimited.

Forced Depreciation

The purpose of issuing banknotes by the puppet "Joint Reserve Bank" is to absorb our legal tender and obtain foreign exchange. However, because our government controlled foreign exchange and the people's faith in legal tender became stronger, they would pay with puppet banknotes as soon as they received them. Therefore, the puppet organization's plan to obtain foreign exchange failed, and the circulation of counterfeit money was greatly affected. They then issued an order, first forcibly stopping the circulation of our legal tender in Pingjin and other occupied urban areas, and then limiting the use of Tianjin-named banknotes from the two banks of China and Communications to 90% of their value. From February 20 this year, it was changed to 60%, and from March 10, the circulation of legal tender on the market was stopped.

Oppressing the Market

The puppet "Ministry of Finance" of the puppet "Provisional Government" issued an order to the Peiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association, stipulating that from February 20, all deposit and loan contracts signed with the word "legal tender" must be changed to the word "national currency" (referring to the banknotes of the puppet Joint Reserve Bank). If they are not changed, they will be calculated according to the second devaluation rate of 60%. Foreign commercial banks still pay legal tender for the drafts they pay out. If they are checks, they will be divided into legal tender and "puppet currency." During the second devaluation period, foreign commercial bills can only be collected at a 60% discount. If it passes March 10, they will not be able to collect on their behalf.

Actual Currency Situation

In fact, in the various guerrilla areas of North China, and in the concession area of Tianjin and the embassy area of Peiping, legal tender has increased in value by about 2%. Moreover, it has never been heard that anyone is using our legal tender at 90% or 60% of its value. It can be seen that the price of our legal tender is stable as before, and its credit is even stronger. On the contrary, the "counterfeit money" is fully used in the two cities of Pingjin, but in reality, its price is lower than that of legal tender.

### Jealousy Among Flower Game Operators: Shooting Leads to Destruction, One Boy Injured

Kong Wenbao, a gambler who works as a "table leg" at the Xinxin gambling den in Zhujia Library on Haig Road, has recently opened a Helihua flower game parlor there, enticing people to gamble. Recently, he had a disagreement with the Yonglihua flower game parlor in the same area, leading to a major conflict. On the afternoon of the 24th, at 3:00 PM, Kong led a group of hooligans, carrying handguns, and stormed into Yongli, destroying it and firing several shots, injuring a boy on the spot. Yongli has temporarily closed down and is preparing to retaliate with a group.

### Drug Trafficking Case on the "Hesheng" Ship: Police Issue Arrest Warrant for the Mastermind

When Jardine Matheson's "Hesheng" ship arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin at the end of last month, the French Concession police discovered a passenger named Li Zhengyun carrying 150 packages of morphine worth tens of thousands of dollars. After interrogation, it was learned that Zhang Ruilin, the manager of a morphine manufacturing facility in Tianjin, had sent Li to Shanghai with the drugs. Li was sentenced to six months in prison by the Second Special District Court. It has now come to light that although the case is closed, the French police have learned that the person in charge of the drug manufacturing facility in Shanghai is Zhang Jintang, who lives at a certain address in Taihe Lane on Paul Beau Road. When the police went to arrest him, Zhang had already fled. The police have now issued an arrest warrant and ordered detectives to apprehend him. It is also reported that Zhang is currently the captain of the Detective Team of the 4th District of the puppet police局.

### Four Thousand Dollars in Cash Robbed

At 11:30 AM yesterday, eight robbers armed with handguns broke into No. 13, Lane 306, Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession, and after silencing the occupants, made off with a staggering four thousand dollars in cash.

### Land Case in Shengping Lane

The French police received a tip-off the other day that someone was selling opium in No. 5, Shengping Lane on Avenue Edward VII. They immediately dispatched detectives to search the premises, seizing more than two pounds of opium wrapped in paper inside a leather bag. However, the men, Liao Weizhang and Liu Changsheng, had already fled. Only two landladies, Liao Chen and Liao Shen, and a tenant, Liu Wang, all from Chaozhou, were taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Miao interrogated them. The police requested an extension to apprehend the fugitive masterminds and investigate the case before bringing charges. Liu Wang confessed to living with Liao Shen but denied selling opium, stating that her husband, Liu Changsheng, was away. Liao Shen stated that she had recently married into the Liao family, that her husband, Liao Weizhang, was in the game business, that Chen was her mother-in-law, and that she was unaware of any opium sales. Liao Chen also denied selling opium. After verifying the statements, the court adjourned the hearing and ordered the defendants to be detained.

### Robbery of Opium Leads to Murder: Convicted Murderer Appeals, Verdict to Be Announced Tomorrow

Shi Xiaodi and other gangsters from Chongming were searching for opium in the Huangpu River on the night of November 3rd last year. A man named Xiao Guilin, who made a living rowing boats in the Huangpu River, was suspected by Shi Xiaodi and others of hiding opium on his boat. They ordered him to stop in the middle of the river for a search. When Xiao refused, Shi Xiaodi and others jumped onto Xiao Guilin's boat and stabbed Xiao's throat with a sharp knife. Xiao resisted with his hands and was stabbed several more times. The injuries to his throat were fatal, and he died on the spot. Afterward, the murderer Shi Xiaodi was arrested by the French Concession police and sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. Judge Qiu Qingbang found him guilty and sentenced Shi Xiaodi to eighteen years in prison for murder and three years and six months for illegal search, to be served concurrently for a total of twenty years. Shi Xiaodi appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, claiming the sentence was unjust. The case was brought before the Third Criminal Court by Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi and Judges Wang Yue and Chen Daqi. The appellant, Shi Xiaodi, stated, "It is true that I jumped onto the deceased's boat to search for opium. However, after I jumped on, the deceased grabbed me and shouted, 'Robber!' I couldn't escape. I was very scared. I saw a fruit knife on the boat, and I picked it up to scare him into letting me go. I didn't expect to accidentally stab him to death. It was manslaughter, not intentional murder. The original sentence of twenty years is too heavy. I request the court to be lenient." The court reviewed the case and adjourned the hearing. The appellant, Shi Xiaodi, was remanded in custody. The verdict will be announced on the 28th.

### Ye Qirong Uses Special Influence to Seize Shopfront for Business: Dachangcheng Cigarette Shop Illegally Occupied, Shareholders Helplessly Resort to Legal Action

Ye Qirong, the manager of the Yuqingfeng Cigarette Paper Shop on Rue du Consulat in the French Concession, opened a Yuji Trading Company in partnership with a Japanese person after the National Army withdrew to the west and the Japanese army occupied Pudong. Ye served as the manager of the company on Dongchang Road in Pudong. At the time, there were few shops in Pudong, so the business thrived, generating substantial profits. Later, the owner of Yuqingfeng, Rong Chenghao, concerned that Ye, as the manager of his shop, was also partnering in a trading company with the

brand name "Yuji," which might cause confusion, requested Ye to change the name of the trading company. Ye reluctantly changed the name of Yuji Trading Company to Datong Cigarette Paper Company. Ye had a relative, a woman named Liu Chen, who had co-founded the Dachangcheng Cigarette Paper Shop on Pingliang Road. After the August 13th Incident, the shop ceased operations due to the situation. Toward the end of last winter, they began to liquidate the business. Ye, coveting the shopfront of Dachangcheng, incited Liu Chen to dissolve the partnership. Ye intended to rely on

special influence to change the name of Dachangcheng to Dachangxiang and open for business. However, the other shareholders of Dachangcheng intended to reopen the business after the liquidation. Therefore, they sent an employee named Wang Rongxian to live in the shop to safeguard it. Unexpectedly, on the 28th of last month, Ye, along with representatives from Liu Chen, went to Dachangcheng and forced Wang to leave the shop. Wang

dared not resist and moved to the shop across the street, owned by his friend Qiu Hongfu. He then accompanied Zhang Guanlan, the manager of Dachangcheng, to the Yulin Road police station to report the situation to the police chief, who suggested filing a lawsuit in court. Ye and others became angry at Qiu Hongfu and reported him to the Japanese military police on the 1st of this month, resulting in Qiu Hongfu, Qiu Amao, and Lu Zhiqing being

detained by the Japanese military. After being interrogated and found to have committed no crime, they were released. Qiu and others believed that the ordeal was caused by Ye Qirong and Liu Chen. They then hired lawyer Zong Yong to file a lawsuit against Ye and others in the First Special District Court for infringement of freedom. The case was heard by Judge Jiang the other day, who ordered a postponement to March 3rd for further investigation.

### Local Area Experiences Rain and Snow Yesterday

The weather in the local area has been erratic recently, alternating between warm and cold, sunny and rainy. Yesterday morning began with a heavy fog that did not dissipate until noon. The weather was slightly colder than the previous day. Unexpectedly, around 3:00 PM, it began to rain again. Initially, it was a light rain, followed by continuous drizzle. Around 4:00 PM, large snowflakes mixed with the rain, which is commonly called "rain-snow mix." It lasted for about half an hour before stopping. However, the fog in the air remained thick, with moisture filling the sky.

### Owner of Egg Shop Hides Mistress in Luxury, Wife Reports to Police, Captures Pair of Lovebirds, Criminal Charges to Be Filed in Court

Yang Ruitang, a Yongren from the city, owner of the Yangruiji Egg Shop at 696 Xinzha Road, is 29 years old. He was betrothed in childhood to Chen Xiuqing, a woman from the same hometown, and they married in their hometown in 1929. They had a son, now four years old. The couple's relationship was generally harmonious. Later, Yang Ruitang's

egg business prospered. He was hired by the Peilin Egg Shop in the city to be a buyer at the branch in Rugao (now dismissed). As a result, he had some savings and his lifestyle became more affluent. He then became fickle and spent his days indulging in pleasure outside. His feelings for Chen became increasingly cold. After the August 13th Shanghai Battle, Chen took her son

to Ningbo to seek refuge. Initially, Yang sent her a monthly allowance to support her. Unexpectedly, he stopped payments in August of last year. Chen, feeling completely helpless, came to Shanghai at the end of last year to look for him. She only recently learned that Yang had opened a new egg shop on Xinzha Road and was living with a prostitute named Yin Suzhen, realizing that her husband had

committed adultery and abandoned her maliciously. Unwilling to accept this, she hired lawyer Zhang Juansheng and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station the other day, requesting an investigation. After the police chief approved it, he dispatched Chinese and Western detectives, along with the plaintiff, to search the premises around midnight the other night. They

captured the pair of lovebirds and took them to the police station. Because Yang is a respectable businessman, he was granted bail. It is reported that the plaintiff intends to file criminal charges against Yang Ruitang and his mistress, Yin Suzhen, in court.

### Abuse of Adopted Daughter: Six Months Imprisonment, Three Years Probation

Wang Lairong, a 13-year-old adopted daughter of Lu Gu, a local woman residing at 405 Haifang Road, was recently abused and beaten by Lu, leaving her with injuries all over her body. On the evening of the 23rd of this month, at 8:30 PM, Lu returned home from a relative's place and learned that Wang Lairong had stolen copper coins. She then beat her severely with firewood, causing significant injuries to her arms and back. Wang took the opportunity to escape and dared not return home. The next day at noon, she was wandering and crying near Sanhe Lane in Xiaoshadu when two children named Jin Di and Hai Da saw her and told their father, Wu Genbao, who questioned her about the matter. He took her to the Gordon Road Police Station and informed the police chief. The police chief ordered her to go to Guangren Hospital, where a doctor confirmed her injuries, and then sent her to Jiliang Institute for temporary care. Detective Xu Guirong was secretly dispatched to 405 Haifang Road and brought Lu Gu to the police station. Yesterday, she was brought to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Kaiyin elaborated on the case and filed a public prosecution for the crime of abuse under Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, submitting the doctor's report for inspection. Wang testified that her original name was Rong, and at the age of eight, her father sold her to Lu Gu as an adopted daughter, whom she called mother, and described the beatings she endured. When questioned, Lu Gu denied beating her with firewood, but her answers were evasive, and she begged for leniency. Judge Huang Risheng sentenced Lu Zhang to six months imprisonment with three years probation. Wang Lairong was temporarily sent to Jiliang Institute for care.

### Attempt to Evade Legal Fees: Fines Imposed

Chen Kaifu, a Yancheng native who performs Yangzhou opera, was arrested by the Xinzha Police Station in the Public Concession on suspicion of theft and sent to the Second Special District Court for trial. His wife, Chen Zhang, hired female lawyer Yu Xiufang to defend him, agreeing on a fee of 400 yuan, of which only 100 yuan was paid in advance. The trial resulted in Chen being declared innocent. Afterward, lawyer Yu repeatedly urged Chen to pay the remaining 300 yuan in legal fees. Unexpectedly, Chen Zhang led her nephew Chen Dehong and hooligans to surround Yu's law office, forcing Yu to nullify the signed retainer agreement. Yu reported this to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Chen Zhang and Chen Dehong. They were sent to the Second District Court for trial. The plaintiff, Yu Xiufang, testified to the above facts and also made a civil claim, requesting that Chen and others publish an apology in the newspaper and decorate her office with red ribbons and greenery. The defendants, Chen and others, denied threatening or coercing her. Judge Zhang Minxian concluded the trial and announced the verdict yesterday, fining Chen Zhang and Chen Dehong 200 yuan each. The civil claim was transferred to the Civil Division of the court.

### Encroachment on Field Deeds: One Case, Two Lawsuits, Court Suspends Trial

After the death of Yu Xiangzhou, a Wuxi native and owner of the Dechangji Iron Shop on North Suzhou Road, the deeds to the ancestral fields in his hometown were all in the hands of his second wife, Zhang. The manager of the shop, Rong Nansen (Xiangzhou's nephew), took 49 field deeds and 17 rent receipts from Zhang two years ago, claiming to register them with the local land administration bureau, but never returned them. The sisters Yu Yinfang and Yinfang, Xiangzhou's daughters, jointly filed a criminal lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Rong Nansen for encroachment. The trial was held by Judge Shen the other afternoon. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant had given the deeds to their half-brother, Yu Xiaozhou, and had already changed the name of the household. He had also altered the Dechang accounting books without permission, making the shop exclusively owned by Xiaozhou. Rong testified that the deeds had been taken by Yu Xiaozhou. After the court reviewed the case, it was noted that Yu Zhang had already filed a lawsuit and the court had ruled that the plaintiff should first file a civil lawsuit. Therefore, it was inappropriate to change the plaintiff and file two lawsuits for one case. The court ordered the trial to be suspended.

Doing Good is the Greatest Joy

### Opium Addiction Spreads Rampantly in Western Shanghai: Opium Dealer Sells Five Boxes of Opium, Establishes General Bureau to Manage All Opium Dens, Harming the People Beyond Comprehension

Jiang Yumen, an opium dealer from Chaozhou, was previously wanted by the Songhu Garrison Command for smuggling red pills but was never apprehended. Recently, he colluded with his fellow townsmen Liu Zheran, Lan Bason, Zheng Chuanying, and others to establish a general bureau for selling opium in the Xinkang Lane of Caojiadu Wujiaochang. He paid a deposit of 100,000 yuan to the Japanese side and obtained the exclusive right to sell drugs. All wholesale opium business for large and small opium dens in Western Shanghai is exclusively managed by this opium general bureau. As a result, Jiang and others have profited greatly. Recently, they signed a contract with the Japanese side to sell five large boxes of opium every day, and the profits are divided equally with the Japanese side. As a result, opium addiction in Western Shanghai is spreading more and more rampantly, harming the people beyond comprehension.

### Pharmacy Employee Dies by Poisoning: Why So Many Suicides?

Ye Yunlong, a Ningbo native, 30 years old, was an employee of the Gutianren Pharmacy at 110 Shandong Road. Due to economic pressure, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts. Yesterday, he went to the Luming Hotel on Daxin Street alone and checked into Room 322. He ingested a large bottle of liquid medicine, attempting to commit suicide. Later, the waiter discovered him and rushed him to the hospital for treatment. However, the poisoning was too severe, and he died before arriving at the hospital.

Chen He, a 24-year-old woman from Hangzhou, lived at 13 Zhilan Lane on Rue愷自爾 in the French Concession. Yesterday morning, for unknown reasons, Chen went to the China Hotel on Guizhou Road and checked into Room 312. She secretly ingested liquid medicine to commit suicide. The waiter discovered her at 2:00 PM and rushed her to the hospital for treatment. The poisoning was severe, and her life was in danger.

Wang Fang, a 24-year-old young woman residing at 42 Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, secretly swallowed a gold ring at 5:20 AM yesterday in an attempt to commit suicide. The reason for her suicide attempt was an argument with her husband.

### Jealousy Leads to Stabbing

Qiu Tang, a 31-year-old woman from Hubei, lived at 4 Laotai'an Lane, Santai Road. Recently, her husband was arrested by the police and sent to court for eating opium and sentenced to imprisonment. With no one to support her, she had an affair with Xu Guishi, a fellow townsman. She then became involved with a man named Liu Linxiang. On the afternoon of the other day, at 6:00 PM, Xu Guishi invited three friends, Chang Yijiang, Sun Xiangyun, and Xu Dexing, and hid small foreign knives. They broke into Qiu Tang's house and harassed her, stabbing her in the left arm. Liu Linxiang was also stabbed by them and took the opportunity to escape. Later, Chinese Constable No. 1770 arrived and arrested Chang Yijiang and the other two, taking them to the Huisi Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, the police sent Chang and the other two to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Kaiyin described the incident in detail and requested an extension. Chinese Constable No. 1770 reported the arrest of the three defendants.

Economic Supplement

### The Dynamics of China's Banking Industry in 1938

— Yang Zheng

The banking industry is the center of financial institutions, so its business growth and the prosperity or decline of the social economy are closely related. Especially during wartime, the banking business in 1938 was even more clearly affected by the war of resistance. As the war zone expanded, it extended from the coastal river basins to the southwestern provinces. This change is worth paying close attention to and is sufficient for future research, but the collection of materials is not easy. The author has systematically compiled the situation of the banking industry as recorded in various newspapers and publications to show the dynamics of the banking industry over the past year. However, omissions and errors in what I have heard and seen are inevitable. Moreover, what is recorded in newspapers is often publicized before it becomes a reality. If there are any errors in this, I hope you will forgive me.

1.  Establishment of Banks

In 1938, due to the impact of the war, only two new banks were established: the He Cheng Bank in Chongqing and the Chongqing Municipal Bank. The former had a capital of 600,000 yuan and was expanded from the He Cheng Money Shop, opening in January. The latter opened on July 1st. Only two banks ceased operations: the Jiading Bank in Jiading and the Tonghe Bank in Shanghai. The former was founded in February of the 11th year of the Republic (1922), with a capital of 100,000 yuan. In the 13th year of the Republic (1924), the capital was increased by 100,000 yuan, bringing the total to 200,000 yuan. On June 13th of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), registration was approved by the Ministry of Finance. On October 11th of this year, it declared closure due to lack of working capital. After the city chamber of commerce attempted reconciliation, creditors agreed at a meeting on November 26th to resume operations on a scheduled date. The latter was founded on May 25th of the 14th year of the Republic (1925), with a capital of 500,000 yuan. It ceased operations on October 21st of the 27th year of the Republic (1938) and applied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for reconciliation in accordance with the Bankruptcy Law. The savings portion was formally reconciled on December 13th of this year, while the commercial portion remains to be resolved.

During this year, the Guangzhou Silk Industry Bank and the Guangdong Industrial Bank were merged into the Guangdong Provincial Bank. The former was founded on March 18th of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), with a capital of 500,000 yuan, and was merged into the Guangdong Provincial Bank in January of this year. The latter was founded on January 1st of the 25th year of the Republic (1936) by the Guangdong Provincial Government, with a capital of 5 million silver dollars, of which only 1 million silver dollars were actually paid up. It was merged into the Guangdong Provincial Bank on February 21st. The capital of the Guangdong Provincial Bank was originally 15 million yuan. After the merger of the Silk Industry Bank and the Guangdong Industrial Bank, the capital remained at 15 million yuan. The only bank that resumed operations was the Shanghai Hengli Bank. The bank ceased operations on August 9th of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). After applying for reconciliation with the city chamber of commerce, it resumed operations on October 4th of this year. The capital remained at 750,000 yuan. Except for the suspension of the savings department, other commercial transactions, trust, custody, and other businesses continued to operate.

2.  Reduction and Addition of Bank Branches

The closing of bank branches is entirely based on business changes. Over the past year, a total of eleven have been closed, including five offices, three branches, two sub-branches, and one remittance office. Regionally, there were five in Jiangsu, two in Fujian, and one each in Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hebei, and Guangdong. The following is a list:

Bank Name Address Type Month/Day Notes

Siming Bank West Gate, Shanghai Branch January 1st Handled by Xiahfei Road Branch

Fuzhou Commercial Ditto Ditto Another day

Guangxi Provincial Bank Guangzhou Remittance Office June 30th

Central Bank Beiping Branch November 1st

Jiaotong Bank Jielu, Shanghai Branch Ditto Continued by Nanjing Road Branch

Ditto Tilanqiao, Shanghai Ditto Ditto

Since the war moved westward, the center of China's financial industry has also gradually shifted to the southwestern provinces, especially Chongqing, which has replaced the old Shanghai. In order for China to achieve long-term resistance and final victory, bank funds must move inland, so as to build the foundation of wartime industry and commerce, and to develop the rural areas of the interior. Therefore, the addition of many branches in the interior this year is a clear indication of this. There are a total of 90, including 42 offices and one sub-association. By bank type, provincial and municipal banks account for 39, commercial banks account for 26, government and franchised banks account for 24, and overseas Chinese-operated banks account for 1. Among them, provincial and municipal banks have the most additions, with 24 in Sichuan, 13 in Hunan, 6 in Guangdong, 3 in Hubei, and 2 each in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Xikang, and Guizhou, and 1 in Gansu.

Sichuan Provincial Bank plans to establish offices in Shangyang, Pengxi, Tongye, Yingshan, Mianzhu, Maoxian, Ranshan, Guang'an, Fengjie, Qiuyang, Jiang'an, Changning, and Meishan, which should be completed within three months. There are also several other banks that are planning to establish branches, but they are not detailed and are therefore omitted.

3.  Post-War Arrangements for Banks in War Zones

Although banks in the war zones suffered significant losses, their lines were still very solid. Not only were there few bankruptcies, but also to facilitate depositors, they mostly tried to move to safe areas and conduct business as usual. This good post-war management phenomenon is of course due to the fact that each bank has clearly understood its own responsibility in the war of resistance, but in reality it is also the success of China's wartime financial policy.

### Finance: Scarcity Makes It Valuable: Gold Prices Rise for Six Consecutive Days, Totaling 85 Yuan, and Ornaments Reach 217 Yuan

Yesterday, the spot market for cash gold was dull due to the weekly holiday, and there were very few people gathered. However, the city's wealthy still had a strong desire to purchase and store it, and entrusted a certain money exchange to purchase it on their behalf. However, sellers all regarded it as valuable due to its scarcity, and supply was quite weak. The market continued to move towards a new high in this price increase trend. This was actually due to the exhaustion of chips and the heavy demand from various gangs. At 10:45, a certain money exchange entered the silver building gang, with 30 taels at 2,241 yuan as the midday closing price, an increase of 6 yuan from the previous day (it has risen for six consecutive days, totaling 85 yuan). It was also heard that a certain money exchange sold 50 taels to a local gang after 10:00 at 2,140 yuan. As a result, gold ornaments in silver shops were also listed at a high of 1 yuan at noon, with Lao Qingyun and other major players changing to 217 yuan, and new players to 215 yuan, buying in at 209 yuan. In addition, a London telegram on the 25th stated that British pure gold continued to fall by one point per ounce due to the continued high value of the pound, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 2.5 points.

### Large Silver Bars Shrink Again Recently, Indian Silver Prices Fluctuate

A London telegram on the 25th stated that speculators were selling and India was buying, while investors were watching and the market was still flat. Large silver bars shrank by .0625 in the near term, while the far term remained stable. A New York silver telegram stated that American silver prices remained stable as before. A Bombay silver telegram stated that Indian silver prices fluctuated, with spot prices shrinking by one anna and near and far terms rising by one anna.

### Securities: A Week's Report on the Chinese and Western Stock Markets

Last week, trading of foreign stocks outside the Public Stock Exchange, though only active for two and a half days, was quite remarkable. The prices of several stocks reached new highs since August 13th. These included Shanghai Gas, Tramways, bearer shares, Kung Ho Hsiang, and Shanghai Rubber ordinary shares.

International Savings Society shares attracted much attention from operators, with exceptionally high trading volume, exceeding 50,000 shares for the entire week. Prices fluctuated between $3.35 and $3.50, closing at $3.45 at the weekend.

Shanghai Land Investment also saw nearly 30,000 shares traded last week, with prices ranging from $8.50 to $8.90, closing at $8.85.

Shanghai Rubber ordinary shares saw over 12,000 shares traded. The price rose from an initial $6.30 to $6.40. At the weekend, two transactions totaling 800 shares pushed the price even higher to $6.60.

Shanghai Land last week also rose in price.

As a result, the market price jumped from $8.90 to $9.50.

### Medicinal Materials: Amomum Villosum Supply Cut Off

Amomum villosum is produced in Qiongyai.  Recently, as that area has been occupied, the source has been cut off. Although the existing stock is plentiful, there is unanimous expectation of rising prices. When trading opened in the market, each dan (unit of weight) was priced at $18.  Previously, it only sold for $13.50.  Currently, the market has increased by $4, but current sales are only sporadic. If demand expands, it will continue to rise.

### Dried and Sundry Goods: High-Quality Sun-Dried Longan Pulp Up By About One Dollar

Shima sun-dried longan pulp, more than a dozen packages had arrived before the big year-end closing. Yesterday, samples were viewed, the color, slices, and quality were all excellent. The opening price was immediately $1.60 higher than before. The packaged variety, a certain firm opened more than one hundred packages yesterday, the price was $210, and the market seems to have settled temporarily. The market price did not rise or fall. Sophora flower buds are very scarce at the base and the source is also lacking, with only sporadic sales, priced at $20.

### Metals: Limited Sales After Price Increase of Native-Made Nails

Native-made wire nails from local factories have seen shortages of raw materials (coiled wire and wire), and the factory has thus hoarded goods to drive up prices. The price has been raised to $17 per barrel (Bessemer). During the end of the lunar year, hoarders and out-of-town merchants competed to purchase them, so trading was quite lively. Recently, seeing market gains, the factory has softened its stance as there have been no new developments in actual sales. Yesterday, only two to three hundred barrels were traded, with the price still at $17. It is heard that for large-scale transactions, the price can still be negotiated. As for small flower-patterned nails, their trading is still quite considerable. Yesterday, local shops and out-of-town merchants sold a total of fifty to sixty barrels. The price for 4-fen nails was $36 per barrel, 5-fen nails $31, and 6-fen nails $26. If one wants to export, the customer must bear the customs duties.

### American Galvanized Iron Sheet Sales Still Strong

American galvanized iron sheets, because of their excellent quality and dazzling shine, are not squeezed out by Japanese goods in the market. Asking prices remain stubbornly high. Since the past few days, because of strong actual sales, merchants from Fujian, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Tianjin, and other regions have made purchases, with two to three hundred bundles being sold. The price for 48-sheet thin iron is $3.78 per sheet, and thick iron such as number 28 is $34.50 per dan, number 26 is $33.75 per dan, number 24 is $31.75 per dan, and numbers 18 to 22 are $32.50 per dan. Local trading is also considerable. But as foreign exchange tightens and sources diminish, the industry holders are very firm and do not relax asking prices for the coming market.

### Grains: White Japonica Rice Called Higher

Yesterday, the source of national rice from the lower reaches of the river had not arrived. The train brought three to four thousand packages of steamed buns. After the market tightened from the afternoon before yesterday, the opening of trading yesterday morning saw upward momentum. The stockpilers were very interested, stimulating activity in this area. At the same time, sellers called for higher prices and held their ground, so that the result was that except for high-grade thick japonica rice, which was slightly higher because of price, the middle-grade goods all rose by two to three jiao. The situation for thin paddy special goods was similar, and the middle grade was also firmer, rising from corner to corner to two jiao. Du Yang Jian Bu Jian Gao Ding Ci Xiu changed from a yuan of red market. After that, he saw his wings and only calmed down.

### Coal: Coal Ball Factory Market Firm

Coal briquette factories stopped work for several days during the Spring Festival and could not deliver goods, resulting in unusually empty merchant stalls in the city, and the demand for goods was urgent. The factories have opened in the past few days, with sales boosted and over a thousand tons sold. The selling price is firm, Yitai Hing coal balls are priced at $33 per ton, Nanyang Double Dragon old brand is $32, a sub brand $29.50, and smaller factories are cheaper by five or six jiao. Those same businessmen take care of transporting the coal, with an extra fee paid. It is heard that the new Yitai Hing factory has also been formally established and will begin shipping.

### The Tragic Side of the Cotton Spinning Industry: How Miserable Are These Times!

Reading Mr. Yuan's article "The Unprecedented Profits of the Cotton Spinning Industry" in this newspaper is indeed praising an outsider. He talks about a chance to make a fortune that comes once in a thousand years. However, Mr. Yuan only knows one thing but not the other. He only knows the joyous side but not the tragic side. The Hudong area, which also belongs to the Concession, can be said to be the culmination of Chinese cotton mills. Not one did not make huge profits. Since being trapped in the smoke and gunfire of war, the tragic side of the cotton spinning industry in this occupied area is truly unbearable to recall.

(A) In the occupied area, the cotton mills, machinery, and goods were either looted or destroyed by artillery fire and were left in a shambles. Some were forced into cooperation (completely seized). Those with integrity who were unwilling to cooperate watched their machines rust and watched the Shanghai West cotton mills make profits of thousands and tens of thousands. Looking back at their own means of production, immobilized under violent seizure, what a tragic situation this is.

(B) The cotton mills trapped in the war zone were unable to operate their means of production. Before the war, "unpaid accounts" for things such as hardware, materials, fuel, gunny sacks, ropes, and bamboo strips, amounted to thousands for large debts and dozens for small debts. Creditors flocked to them at the end of the year to press for repayment. Some foreign firms even disregarded the history and feelings of ten or twenty years of dealings with the factories and actually hired lawyers to issue their formal ultimatum, resorting to legal action. It is originally not to blame, but this is a huge disaster that is irresistible by human forces. The so-called "eating the dead without spitting out bones" is true. Where does the factory get the money to deal with this? They could only lower their heads and make excuses to get by.

(C) The disbanded groups of unemployed people wandered aimlessly. Even the small number of retained workers who received only forty to fifty percent of their pre-war salary felt that their lives were strained, prices soared, and they were already suffering from robbing Peter to pay Paul. At the end of the year, they saw that other people's pockets were full, while they were "pitted by fate" and their purses were empty. There are probably many who pawned their belongings to get through the year (the end of the year).

(D) Friends who unfortunately worked in cotton trading in the war zone lost all their houses and cotton, and fled to the isolated island empty-handed. Some were even cotton bosses before the war, but after the war, they couldn't even find a position on the isolated island that paid more than ten gold coins a month. This is what the author heard with his own ears.

"Is it better to enjoy happiness alone or to share it with others?" I think that the factories with unprecedented profits should also take care of this (Long Junsheng).

### The Radiant Smile of the Woolen Industry

The price of woolen goods on the 27th has always been high. Although the business of out-of-town merchants has suddenly decreased, the local market trading is more prosperous than in the past. The large and small shops in the industry have made very large profits. Those who operate stores that do straight sales have extra profits. Those who have old inventory and large quantities of inventory purchased in the spring and summer have especially large profits. Therefore, all the woolen industry colleagues, large and small, have made great profits. The awarding of year-end bonuses made employees and managers happy, and there were many who were radiant with smiles. Now, we are investigating and publishing the net profits of colleagues. Those who did not earn more than 5,000 yuan are not included.

Shanghai Education Sector: Opinions on Education Reform

### In-Service Secondary School Teachers' Professional Development Issues After the Establishment of Teachers Colleges (3)

— Huang Shijin

(3) Professional Development Opportunities for Teachers After the Establishment of Teachers Colleges

The current situation of secondary school teachers in China is such that the remedial measures must of course be professional development. However, in the past, there was only one normal university in the country, and teachers found it difficult to find a place for professional development. Because there were no opportunities in the country in the past, many went abroad for professional development. However, studying abroad is far from home, costly, and the learning does not fit the national conditions. In addition, the atmosphere for professional development has always been cold. Teacher qualifications have not been emphasized. Therefore, most teachers do not feel the need for professional development. As a result, they follow their inertia and muddle along, and it has come to this day. Now that the proposition for teacher training is very different from the past, teachers' views on professional development should also change rapidly. In European and American countries, great importance is attached to teachers' professional development. Educational administrative authorities, school authorities, and teachers themselves are all working hard to promote effective professional development methods. After the establishment of teacher colleges in China, on the one hand, it is necessary to train healthy teachers for the future. On the other hand, appropriate opportunities should also be given for the professional development of in-service teachers. Otherwise, future graduates of teacher colleges will come out class by class, and these outdated in-service teachers will be eliminated batch by batch. In the end, the result will not be a tragedy of a large number of unqualified teachers becoming unemployed, but a trend of new and old teachers competing for jobs. The Ministry of Education is aware of this, so Article 5 of the Teacher College Regulations stipulates that "Teacher colleges should work with the educational administrative organs in the area to thoroughly investigate the needs of secondary school teachers in the area in order to have a planned enrollment." At the same time, Articles 12, 13, and 14 stipulate that teacher colleges may set up teacher research institutes and recruit in-service secondary school teachers of various levels to take professional development certificates as diplomas for teacher certification. The former is to closely recruit new students, and the latter is to take care of in-service teachers. After the destruction of this war, the economy of both the country and individuals will inevitably be difficult. Secondary schools may not be able to add more, and secondary school teachers are therefore easy to be excessive. Teacher colleges should recruit fewer new students and open more professional development classes to allow teachers with existing experience to increase their professional training opportunities. This method is not only effective and fast, but also more economical. Furthermore, the teachers who have completed the professional development have also obtained a guarantee of their position and will not be in danger of being eliminated.

### Donghua Wins Against Lax Again with a Score of 6-3; Leading 4-1 in the First Half

In the first round of the West Union Football First Division, Donghua had already narrowly defeated its strong opponent, Lax, with a score of 4-3. Yesterday morning, they met again in the second round. The audience expected a fierce battle. Unexpectedly, Lax's performance has been declining recently. Yesterday, Favor was not even on the field, and the forwards had no room to maneuver. As a result, they lost convincingly with a score of 6-3. Donghua led 4-1 in the first half, much to the delight of the audience. Although rain threatened yesterday morning, the audience at Yiyuan Field still numbered in the thousands.

Donghua Team:

Zhou Dayun, Zhuang Youren, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Shu Shigeng, Xu Chengxun, Lin Dianhua, Wan Xianghua, Wu Binghao, Dai Linjing, Shen Jia Youliang

Lax Team:

Brote Lee, Luo Lin Buxini Qing, Shi Simon, Ke Xu Naineng, Mike Deng, Ge Bo Liening, Si Yinggelun, Ke Mada, Kai Pusi Ding

Two Goals in a Row: Donghua kicked off with a strong offensive. Dai and Jia penetrated deeply twice but failed to score. Binghao's shot also went wide. At this time, the Lax team was besieged on all sides, and the situation was completely controlled by Donghua. Before long, A Dai was about to shoot when Simmons suddenly rushed up and collided with him head-on. A Dai made a hook shot, which was brilliant, but unfortunately, it hit the post and bounced back. After eight minutes of stalemate, A Dai passed to Wan Jin, who then sent it to the center. Jia and Shen rushed in at the same time, and Youliang precisely hit the ball, making it 1-0, Donghua taking the lead eight minutes into the game. Lax counterattacked, and Kepusiding shot from close range, but Dayun saved the ball skillfully. Boli Ning rushed up, and Jiang Zhaoxiang kicked the ball out of danger. At 14 minutes, Youliang passed to Shiyan. Brote tried to block Shiyan, but Shiyan had already passed to Wan Jin, who pushed the ball into the empty net, making it 2-0.

Leading 4-1: Donghua scored two consecutive goals, and the Lax team became even more sluggish. At 28 minutes, the Lax team suddenly showed its edge, and Mike Deng unleashed his only fierce shot, which grazed past the goal, becoming a wasted opportunity. Unexpectedly, only two minutes later, Mada rushed to the goal like a flying arrow, kicking fiercely. Dayun dived, but the ball still slipped in, Lax winning a goal (2-1). Wanting to catch up, the entire army advanced, intending to launch a sharp attack, leaving the defense empty. At 34 minutes, A Dai saw the weakness and charged with the ball, successfully breaking through, with no one around. He calmly scored, making it 3-1. Five minutes later, A Dai made another beautiful shot, and Donghua took an absolute advantage with a score of 4-1 in the first half.

Sudden Turnaround: After the lemon break, the situation became unusually dull, with a stalemate lasting for more than 20 minutes. Both sides' offensives were split three ways, with Donghua still occupying two parts. It was not until 24 minutes that Mike Deng took a long shot from afar, and Dayun thought it would go wide but unexpectedly rolled into the left corner (4-2). Donghua suffered an unexpected loss. At 33 minutes, Kepusiding shot from the side, and the ball hit the left post, bouncing to the near side. Dayun rushed up to save, but Boli Ning, Yinggelun, and Mada rushed in together, knocking him down and injuring his abdomen with a kick from Boli Ning. He lay on the ground for a minute, and the ball flew past the goal, a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, Zhaoxiang kicked it out. At 39 minutes, Shen Shiyan picked the ball, and Lee returned it. Lin Dianhua took a long shot from 30 yards, hitting the crossbar. Brote jumped up to save, and although the ball was patted out, it had already crossed the goal line, making it 5-2. Two minutes later, A Dai scored again, making it 6-2. One minute later, Mada took a shot, which went diagonally into the right corner, making it 6-3. Soon after, the whistle blew, and Donghua won with a score of 6-3.

### Lido Crushes Russian Club with 27 Goals; Unprecedented Record of Wide-Open Defense; Russian Club Barely Scored One Goal Back

In the West Union Football Division C match, Lido played against the Russian Club yesterday afternoon at Jiaozhou Park in the rain. The strength of the two sides was vastly different, and Lido controlled the entire game. Lido's five forwards repeatedly broke through the enemy's goal. The Russian Club was at a loss and could not recover. They tried their best to score a goal in the first half to avoid a shutout. Lido scored nine goals in one breath, ending the first half with a score of 9-1. After the lemon break, Lido scored another 14 goals. In the end, several players from the Russian Club withdrew, and only seven players remained to fight, and the team's lineup was extremely depleted. The overall situation became increasingly fragmented, and they were defeated by Lido with a score of 1-27. Such a huge score is almost like a basketball record. The other Division C match between Gongyuan United and Weisheng was not played because Weisheng team members had to go on duty.

### Suggestions to the School Principal

— Mao Lie

The educational sector's movement to save the nation through thrift has reportedly achieved considerable success since its launch, which is truly gratifying! I don't know exactly how each school is implementing it, but I have some opinions that I would like to share with the esteemed principals. As this concerns the public good, I believe you will all agree.

Children and young people in this isolated island are fortunate to be able to study peacefully in these times. However, I believe that among them, there are many students whose parents are similar to refugees, suffering from the impact of the war and experiencing financial difficulties everywhere. Now, asking their children to save the nation through thrift is, of course, their undeniable duty, as they are slightly better off than the refugees. However, the leaders of this movement, especially the esteemed principals, must take this into consideration and show understanding so that they can fulfill this obligation without incurring additional expenses, achieving the best of both worlds.

I believe that since it is called saving the nation through thrift, we should focus on the word "thrift." In addition to the frugality of students' families and the students themselves, the school should also save on waste and use cheaper supplies if possible. As far as I know, there are many things that can be saved or substituted in schools at all levels. For example, a box of crayons or paints in elementary schools costs six or seven cents, which, in my opinion, are luxuries in this era. Other drawing paper and various notebooks should be saved whenever possible, and even if they cannot be saved, there are ways to utilize waste materials, and it is not necessary to demand uniformity. As for middle schools and universities, where consumption is even greater, there are even more things that can be saved or substituted. If the esteemed principals pay attention to this and implement frugality, I believe that in addition to solving the problem of disaster relief donations and achieving the target amount, there will be other benefits as well: First, general savings in material resources, enabling less material resources to achieve greater effectiveness; Second, because most educational supplies are imported, this can reduce the outflow of funds.

Furthermore, parents will be happy to donate if they see the school saving for their children, even the poorest ones, because they don't need to spend much in addition to the predetermined tuition and miscellaneous fees, and they will certainly not object. Perhaps the best way is for the esteemed principals to directly designate savings on certain supplies and transfer the fees already paid for those items to disaster relief donations, in addition to voluntary contributions. This will make things even easier.

The above are my "personal views," and I wonder what the wise principals think?

### Departure

— Gong Shuhui

The principal is a broom, sweeping back and forth on the playground; many students are fallen leaves, rolling back and forth with the broom.

The principal, with drooping eyelids, tilted his head and swept to the school gate, saying, "Everyone turn left, face me!"

Under the fate of the broom, the fallen leaves rolled to the left in unison.

"Come!" The eyelids lifted higher: "The girls' group leans to the far left!"

A pile of more colorful leaves blew to stick to the × army carrying guns, stroking the hair of Chinese children, the "amiable East Asia."

"Everyone, clean yourselves up!" The principal frowned. Looking at the senior students in the back, who were vigorously patting their sleeves, stirring up smoke and dust, he waved his hand upward:

"Today, we must be especially neat. Boys wearing student caps, come out and form a line; those wearing blue cloth long gowns, also form a line. Girls wearing short skirts, form a line; those wearing cheongsams, form a line; those wearing velvet coats, form a line. Everyone, don't divide by grade, quickly line up."

The leaves danced in a whirlwind, flying around in confusion.

"　!" A female student cried because the wooden comb on her head was entangled in another female student's velvet coat, and her hair was pulled very painfully.

The Queen hurried to separate the comb and the velvet.

"After the line is formed, I have a few important words to say, everyone listen carefully!" The principal's eyelids, at this moment, only lifted the right one, the left one seemed to be slightly twitching. "Going out today is to welcome the brave and righteous × army, who have just returned from suppressing bandits in the countryside. When you see the brave and righteous × army, you must take off your hats and bow. Do you hear? Raise your hands if you hear!"

Wang Hua, a fifth-grader, touched the swollen, black-purple bruise on his face that had not yet faded, suddenly remembered the scene of a few days ago like a flash of lightning.

But the leaves all raised their hands. The hands of those lower-grade students were slanted, like the horizontal and vertical lines of young branches.

"When you see the brave and righteous × army, you must show a smile on your face, expressing friendliness, do you hear?"

The young branches of the leaves were again crooked and slanted.

Wang Hua bit his lip, and the wings of anger fluttered and trembled in his chest.

"When you see the teacher clap his hands, you must also clap your hands. Do you hear?"

Everyone raised their hands again, but this time it seemed that a student, hearing the words "clap hands," took it as a cue to actually clap once.

Wang clenched his fists tightly, like two drumsticks.

"Don't move!" The principal said sternly, turning his head and glancing with his twitching left eye to the side: "Mr. Zhang, bring out the flags!"

Mr. Zhang and the others who were not Mr. Zhang all brought out bundles of flags and distributed them to the student ranks.

The kindergarten students found the colorful flags interesting and shook them vigorously. Li Dasheng, a third-grader, pointed to the word "shan" ("good") on the flag "× China Friendship" and asked the short-legged tiger Gu Rong. The short-legged tiger patted his big head and said, "Shan, sounds the same as 'ran' in infectious disease."

The female students in the senior grades were flattening the wrinkled corners of the flag.

The principal's eyes were still twitching, and this time he raised his voice: "Don't shake the flags!"

The flags stood quietly in the hands of the elementary school students.

"I don't want it!" Suddenly, Wang Hua's flag flew through the air with a "swish swish" sound, and then rested wearily next to the principal's black leather shoes.

"What?" The principal, unexpectedly provoked, opened his mouth.

"I don't want it, I'm not going! My father was shot by them, my sister was dragged away by them, the pain on my face hasn't healed yet, I haven't forgotten those bastards!" It was a string of explosive cannonballs.

"Oh, are you crazy?" The principal was embarrassed and had to say sternly again, "Mr. Zhang, drag him out!"

Mr. Zhang and the others who were not Mr. Zhang carried out the order.

The purple swollen face, in a few arms, turned around like being scalded by boiling water, stubbornly standing under a pine tree outside the school gate.

The inky pupils of the leaves were like iron, attracted by the magnet under the pine tree.

"Everyone, ignore him," said the principal, and then shouted the command loudly, "Forward...dress! Attention!...At ease! Forward...march!" The veins on his forehead crawled like earthworms.

A string of leaves swept out under the broom.

"Sing the 'East Asia Alliance Song'!"

The ranks of leaves were immersed in the innocent singing.

At this time, Wang Hua, with fiery eyes, rushed into the ranks with iron-hammer fists, shouting, "Don't go!"

Everyone was stunned.

### Fog

— Gao Xiaochong

The fog, white and vast, vaguely pervades, like thick water vapor. (Countless tiny water droplets covered the earth.) The ancient temple only protruded its corners, the bare trees only extended their branch tips, and the distant pagoda only revealed its top. The fog, white and vast, vaguely pervades.

One pair of feet, steady, then another pair came. One pair, one pair, a hurried line of people, only a few sharp stones were visible at the foot of the mountain. In front was white and vast, behind was white and vast, all around was white and vast, walking quickly. Looking up at the mountainside, one sees a piece of white, vaguely. Taking a shortcut, turning a bend, looking at the toes while walking. "Don't make noise, be careful, bend over." A password was passed to the whole team. Silently, dozens of burly men instantly turned into eighty-year-old men.

"Gun forward, crouch and advance." Eyes looking ahead, sometimes glancing left and right. Large stones, fine sand, withered grass, tree roots, the rugged road, left behind. "Scatter!" A few words were whispered. Encirclement! One hugs, one kills, resulting in the enemy's sentinel. Half a circle of red was revealed on the high ground, watching him advance.

Quietly, quietly, everyone had arrived. Hiding under big trees, lying next to big stones, and silently lying on the ground to move forward. Boom! Boom boom boom! Peng peng boom boom boom...! A hand grenade called out dozens of others. Excitement, hatred, appeared on the face of every man. Shouts of killing, gunshots, and hand grenade sounds were intertwined. The enemy, panicked, frightened, and embarrassed, wanted to escape. Where could they? Bullets, bayonets, and hand grenades were all around. Escaping, crawling, crying, shouting, one by one they ate bullets, bayonets, and hand grenades, blood flowing crisscross. A few were left, kneeling, kowtowing, raising their hands. Each was tied, prisoners.

Triumphant return, chests puffed out, necks stiffened, carrying guns, walking, striding. Singing loudly: "Fog! Today is fog, tomorrow is fog, the day after tomorrow is also fog! We hope every day is fog. Kill kill kill! So that we can kill them and leave none behind..."

### People and Heroes

— Yang Yanqi

Are heroes people? Yes. But not everyone is a hero. It is precisely because not everyone is a hero that heroes have a value of worship.

However, today's heroes are buried too much. Although "fame" is not the goal of a hero, there is also a place in history, enough to draw golden lines on the blank history, shining with immense light, and eternally recorded. Eternal recording is not the limelight of the hero himself, but the idol of future generations. Christians worship the thoughts of Christ and Jesus as a person, aren't they all due to a Bible? Therefore, literature is the stone tablet of heroes, a stone tablet erected in the universe for heroes.

Therefore, literary workers seem unable to forget the mission of erecting monuments for heroes. Erecting a monument is not just writing an epitaph, but writing an article of any form. If there are heroes in literary works, they will have vitality, blood, and flesh. Otherwise, it is a dead art without life.

Today, the psychology of worshiping heroes is almost lower than worshiping beauties. Because heroes are not flavorful enough, afraid,不敢崇拜. And beauties, it is easy to write on paper and easy to fascinate people, anyway, no one will be serious; so, the craze of beauty worship is flourishing!

Maybe there is a reason, everyone dare not look up to heroes, only willing to bow their heads and stroke the hands of beauties. So, closing your eyes, so that you first do not see reality clearly, and then create a shell for yourself, wrap yourself inside, dreaming all day long, hoping to ascend to heaven and enjoy happiness in the dream. In fact, people are on the ground, and they will not ascend to heaven unless they die, not to mention whether they will ascend to heaven after death is still a question. Since you live on the ground, you have to live on the ground, and it is impossible to get rid of the reality of the ground; since you live in the present, you have to live in the present, and it is impossible to get rid of this great era. Impossible, impossible, a thousand impossibilities!

Therefore, the stone tablet of literature has a second use, like a mirror, it must have a reflecting function. To reflect the reality on this ground, to reflect the color of this great era. Otherwise, it is either a rotten bone of a dead person, or an empty dream. The rotten bone will soon rot more, rotten to nothing; when the empty dream comes to awakening, it will also drift away, not knowing where to go; like a puff of smoke, lighter than smoke, like a cloud, thinner than a cloud; everything is not a stone tablet, but colorful soap bubbles, beautiful, yes: just lacking a little life.

Ernst Toller said: "Art does not eliminate her effectiveness after arousing the emotions of the audience." She must leave traces in the world forever, because literature is fundamentally a trace; art is beautiful, but beauty must have the beauty of life. The face of a mummy will never smile for a lifetime, what else can you say?

Art wants to express heroes, yes; not everyone is a hero, I hope art will not be wasted. It doesn't matter if the author's energy is wasted, but it's really not worth wasting the reader's time. People, heroes, at least you have to make it a little clear.

### Amidst the Flames

— Zhou Yan

These words made everyone slightly disappointed, but they all thought that Battalion Commander Ye was deliberately exaggerating to cause alarm, so they didn't take it seriously. Seeing that everyone was indifferent, Battalion Commander Ye couldn't help but secretly shake his head, took a sip of wine, and said:

"I'm not afraid of the enemy attacking. I can withstand one or two thousand men. What I fear are the traitors who act as accomplices for the enemy. To be honest, if China didn't have traitors, we would definitely eliminate the enemy faster."

Then they talked about the traitors again. Wu Yaqing said that he had seen many fake teams along the way that not only could not protect the people and resist the enemy, but also colluded with the enemy and harassed the people everywhere. He said with great emotion: "A good noun, when it comes to China, is often misused. Now even robbers and bandits can use high-sounding terms to disguise their atrocities."

"It is these people who are the most difficult to deal with!" Battalion Commander Ye sighed and said, "If we don't suppress them, it's really unconscionable to allow them to disturb the people. But if we suppress them, at this time, it is really heartbreaking for Chinese to fight Chinese. And if we push them too hard, it's hard to guarantee that they won't openly surrender to the enemy and become accomplices for the enemy, which would be an even greater disaster."

Everyone sighed in silence, but after all, it was none of their business, so they just talked about it and didn't take it to heart. As the banquet ended, they excused themselves and left. The New Year's Day military-civilian celebration was in full swing at the end of the market. The street play "Put Down Your Whip" had reached its finale, and the shouts from the stage and the audience merged into one. Battalion Commander Ye nodded and said:

"The morale of the people here is very useful, but it still needs to be deepened."

Battalion Adjutant Liang seemed to have some concerns and said to Battalion Commander Ye:

"In this kind of weather, enemy planes may not come. Even if they come, evacuation will still be possible. Everyone has worked hard enough on weekdays. It's a rare New Year's Day, so let's not spoil their fun."

Battalion Adjutant Liang said no more, and together with several other battalion commanders, followed Battalion Commander Ye back to the battalion headquarters. (21)

### Relieving Apprentices

— Qin

Apprentices in Chinese shops and factories seem to be like little servants. When we walk into small shops or small factories, we often see twelve or thirteen-year-old servants wearing tattered clothes doing odd jobs. Those are apprentices.

Apprentices have to get up at five o'clock every morning and don't get to sleep until ten o'clock at night. They have no rest time and no holidays. If things are busy, they also have to work at night. If they do things wrong, they will be punished, such as standing, kneeling, slapping, hitting palms, and spanking. Such a life has to go through three or five years before it is considered completed. After completion, they can be called "partners" or "clerks" and can receive salaries. During the apprenticeship period, there is no salary.

We know that today's apprentices are the future managers and staff of shops and factories. Today's managers and staff of shops and factories are former apprentices. The underdevelopment of industry and commerce in our country is mostly due to the lack of economic common sense and business ethics among industrial and commercial managers and staff. Because what they learned during their apprenticeship was too superficial. If we want to revitalize industry and commerce, we must start with relieving apprentices in order to achieve results. Here are a few measures for fellow countrymen who care about industry and commerce to study and refer to.

1.  The government of our country should urgently formulate "Apprentice Regulations." At a minimum, the working hours of apprentices should be limited to eight hours per day, and at most no more than ten hours.

2.  The minimum age of apprentices should be fifteen years old or older.

3.  The work of apprentices should be within the scope of learning. Odd jobs such as cooking, washing clothes, carrying children, and emptying chamber pots should not be called upon apprentices to do.

4.  The term of apprenticeship should not exceed three years at most.

5.  In addition to providing food and lodging for apprentices, employers should provide living expenses, at least three yuan per month.

6.  Every morning and evening, employers should give apprentices the opportunity to study, such as attending night schools or tutoring schools. All tuition fees should be borne by the employer.

### A Strange Year of Yin and Yang

— Hutu

The Gregorian calendar year has just passed not long ago, and the lunar year is approaching again. With less than two months between them, we have to celebrate two New Years, making people confused, which is really a bit strange with yin and yang.

Some say that the Gregorian calendar year is a foreign year, and the lunar year is a Chinese year. Those who like to imitate foreign ways naturally like to celebrate the Gregorian calendar year, while farmers like the lunar year because its solar terms are clear, with the vernal equinox and the grain rain. The Gregorian calendar is even clearer than the lunar calendar in terms of solar terms, and its calculation of months and years is more accurate and easier to remember. The government has long ordered the uniform adoption of the Gregorian calendar throughout the country, but most people still comply outwardly but defy inwardly. The result is that whether it is the Gregorian calendar year or the lunar calendar year, everyone celebrates them all, and the result is uncertainty about yin and yang, and delays in months and years. Isn't this a reason for being strange with yin and yang?

In fact, the Gregorian calendar year is very convenient, easy to remember, and easy to calculate. Unlike the lunar calendar year, the months are large and small, unpredictable, and the months before and after the intercalary month are unclear. Here is a song about the solar terms of the Gregorian calendar for reference:

The practical Gregorian calendar is very convenient,

All twenty-four solar terms are easy to calculate;

Each month has two terms on a fixed date,

At most differing by one or two days;

In the first half of the year, six, twenty-one,

In the second half of the year, eight, twenty-three;

If you memorize these few sentences,

You won't have to flip through the almanac again;

January has Minor Cold followed by Major Cold,

If planting early rice, you must plow the fields;

February has Start of Spring and Rain Water,

The wheat fields should be weeded;

March has Awakening of Insects and Vernal Equinox,

Rice fields should be plowed eight inches deep again;

April passes with Pure Brightness and Grain Rain,

Rape flowers bloom and wheat turns green;

May has Start of Summer and Grain Full,

Harvesting wheat and weeding should not be late;

June arrives with Grain in Ear and Summer Solstice,

It's hard to open your eyes in the plum rain;

July has Minor Heat followed by Major Heat,

Although the weather is hot, weeds must be hoed;

August has Start of Autumn and End of Heat,

The ears of early rice are already ripe in the fields;

September has White Dew and Autumnal Equinox,

After harvesting rice, the fields are plowed again;

October brings Cold Dew and Frost's Descent,

Only peanuts remain in the fields;

November has Start of Winter and Minor Snow,

Rice and wheat turn into money, joy and happiness;

Just wait for Major Snow and Winter Solstice to arrive,

And enjoy another spring with wine around the stove.

This song is indeed a good song. Once you memorize it, you no longer need to buy the "Old-Style New Almanac." But we still need to explain the meaning of this song.

Our earth revolves around the sun, taking 365 days, plus 5 hours, 48 minutes, 57 seconds, and 39 hundredths of a second, to complete a full revolution around the sun, which is called a year. The so-called spring, summer, autumn, and winter are the four seasons of the year, and these seasons are also determined according to the earth's rotation around the sun. For example, if the earth is a flat face, with the sun in the middle between the nose and the eyes, and the earth starts rotating from the mouth, the starting point is considered "Winter Solstice." Slowly rotating towards the upper left, it reaches the left ear, which is "Vernal Equinox." The time it takes to travel this distance is about ninety days. In a leap year, add one day. Then slowly rotate towards the top of the head, which is "Summer Solstice." The time it takes to travel this distance is about ninety-two days. Then rotate downwards, reaching the right ear, which is "Autumnal Equinox." The time it takes to travel this distance is about ninety-three days. Then rotate downwards, reaching the mouth, which is "Winter Solstice" again. The time it takes to travel this distance is about ninety days. Adding them all up, it is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 57 seconds, and 39 hundredths of a second. If you ask why the length of each journey varies, the general answer is: because this face is flat, the distance from "Winter Solstice" to "Vernal Equinox" is the closest to the sun, so the number of days is the least; the distance from "Summer Solstice" to "Autumnal Equinox" is the farthest from the sun, so the number of days is the most.

For convenience, we treat 365 days as a year, and the odd numbers are added up every four years to make a day, which is added to the end of February. Since the method of circling is like this, and the weather, temperature, or day length of each part of the earth are different during the circling journey, this is formed by the relationship between the earth's rotation and the direct and oblique sunlight. Our China is located in the middle of the northern hemisphere of the earth. During the "Winter Solstice" period, sunlight directly shines on a line in the middle of the southern hemisphere of the earth (called the Tropic of Capricorn). Because the waist of the earth in our place (i.e., the equator) is much higher than the middle of the two hemispheres, people in this hemisphere naturally have some eye blockage when looking at the light from that hemisphere, so the time they meet is short, and the day is naturally short. The sunlight is also the same, and very little of the light is blocked and shot over, so the weather is cold, and the days are short and the nights are long. But as the earth keeps rotating, the sunlight slowly shines directly to the middle again, and the sunlight slowly becomes more and more abundant every day, so the days slowly become longer, and the climate slowly becomes warmer. When the sunlight shines directly onto the middle band of the earth (the equator), the amount of light is neither too much nor too little, and the temperature is just right. This is the period of the "Vernal Equinox." The weather is mild, and the day and night are the same length. But as the earth rotates, the sunlight slowly shines onto the northern hemisphere, and the weather here becomes warmer, and the days become longer. When the sun shines on top of our heads, the light is the most intense. This is the "Summer Solstice." The weather is hot, and the days are long and the nights are short. At this time, sunlight has been blocked by a big rope (the Tropic of Cancer) and can no longer move north. As the earth rotates, the sunlight slowly moves away from us, so the weather cools down and the time shortens. This is the "Autumnal Equinox." The weather and time are the same as during the "Vernal Equinox." Later, because the earth rotates towards the southern hemisphere, we feel cooler weather and shorter time here. When its direct rays are blocked by the rope in the south and no longer move, and directly shine on that rope, it is the "Winter Solstice." The weather is the coldest and shortest. Therefore, the earth rotates non-stop, forming the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter in a year.

Unfortunately, these principles are not represented by diagrams, but if readers study carefully, they will know that the Gregorian calendar is indeed accurate and convenient, and more rational than calculating by the moon like the lunar calendar. Because the Gregorian calendar year, 365 days, differs from the number of days in the earth's revolution around the sun by less than six hours, and only differs by one day in four years. The lunar calendar has twelve full moons, with five or six small months inside. Calculating this way, a year of 355 or 6 days differs from the Gregorian calendar by about ten days. Gentlemen, just think about the high interest rates of farmers, the salaries of civil servants, and the rent of three-room tenants. How inconvenient is that?

Everyone understands the benefits of the Gregorian calendar and follows the Gregorian calendar rules. Then, over time, you won't need the old-style new almanac. However, the lunar New Year is coming. This naturally won't be strange with yin and yang, with delays in months and years, making people confused.

### A Woman in Distress

— Feifei

On the way, I met a woman in distress, pleading with me sadly: Her eyes changed color as tears flowed, and her hands trembled. Her clothes were tattered and did not cover her body, and her limbs were skinny; she wanted to walk but could not move forward, and her steps were very weak. She spoke to me mumbling, saying that her background was not humble; she had servants at her command, and the signboard was hundreds of feet high, only because of the "August 13th" incident, the war suddenly started; flames came all over the place, her courage was shattered, and her heart was frightened. It was difficult to live safely in her hometown, and her old home became an empty house. Supporting the old and carrying the young, she only wanted to escape for her life. She wandered to other places, and the funds were all used up; her son died on the battlefield, and her husband died on the side of the road; one daughter was taken away, and there has been no news of her to this day; she returned to her home again, and the house became rubble. Hunger and cold tormented each other, and poverty and illness repeatedly struck; she had no full meal during the day, and she relied on the eaves for shelter at night. Where to go in the vastness, to whom to weep sadly? From then on, she wandered and became a wandering skeleton. Alas - Hearing her words, tears fell like rain, and anger surged in my heart without stopping. I call on tens of thousands of compatriots to unite and protect the country and the people to protect their homes. Compatriots, wake up quickly and don't be cattle and horses for others!

The twelfth lunar month arrives again on the twenty-second or third;

I, Xiaoer, don't know how others celebrate the New Year,

Xiaoer can talk to you about how I celebrate the New Year.

Since the cold winter twelfth lunar month has arrived,

Every household is busy celebrating the New Year;

Some offer chicken and fish to their ancestors,

Some gather around the stove to eat New Year's Eve dinner;

Some burn incense and worship the Bodhisattva,

Some carry gifts to give away;

It's just the twenty-third,

Preparing to send off the Kitchen God diligently;

Preparing a sedan chair and horses is not enough,

You also have to buy candy for offerings;

Just because the Kitchen God goes to the upper world,

To tell the Jade Emperor about good and evil;

It's better to buy candy to stick the Kitchen God's mouth shut,

As the saying goes, "If you eat someone's things, your mouth will be soft."

I hope he says good things to heaven,

And ask for peace in the lower world;

This natural custom has been inherited to the present,

But it is also necessary to celebrate the New Year in this way.

Wang Xiaoer doesn't believe in Taoism at all,

Therefore, I don't hold any ceremonies.

(White) Everyone, sending off the Kitchen God and giving gifts is also a matter of human nature. It's the usual practice every year, but now disasters are everywhere, and people are struggling to make a living. How can we bear to gather around the stove for a small drink? Why bother sending off and welcoming? And why bother worshiping gods and ghosts? Confucius said, "If you cannot serve people, how can you serve ghosts?" If you have spare money, go to relieve the refugees or contribute to the country, that is necessary. If you must buy candy to send off the Kitchen God and ask for kind words about good and evil, why bother? To be honest, if the current Kitchen God is really psychic, he will see that you "have fat meat in the kitchen, and starving corpses in the fields," and he will definitely report to the Jade Emperor that you are unkind and unjust and that you eat humans like beasts. He will never keep silent because of a piece of candy. Therefore, I say that everything should be done for the peace of mind. Are there really gods and ghosts? If you think again and again, you will know that what I say is correct.

New Year decorations are really fresh and beautiful,

There are many shops on the street;

New Year paintings are displayed here,

Spring couplets are being written there;

There are also stories about the White Snake,

And Tang Monk going to the Western Paradise;

There is also a list of immortals who were deified,

And Lu Bu flirting with Diao Chan;

Xiaoer doesn't like any of these,

I only buy Gou Jian who slept on firewood and tasted gall;

Jing Ke assassinated Qin was truly loyal and brave,

Xue Pinggui joined the army and bid farewell to his kiln;

These are all patriotic heroes,

Whose beautiful names have been passed down to this day;

I'm happy after buying the New Year paintings,

Then I go to the other side to choose spring couplets;

There are those that say "Promote a New Atmosphere,"

And those that say "Restore the Old Mountains and Rivers."

There are also "National Sovereignty and Independence,"

Paired with "The Republic of China for Ten Thousand Years."

"Pay attention to fire safety" is written in the kitchen,

"Be careful to save water and electricity" is pasted on the wall;

All of these are maxims,

But they are just taken as mottoes.

(White) The meaning of spring couplets and New Year paintings must be alerting and thought-provoking. Unfortunately, what is sold outside is stupid and vulgar, either a family reunion of gods and immortals, or a harmonious atmosphere of gathering treasures and making a fortune, which makes people feel useless after seeing it. Although I, Xiaoer, am a rough person, I don't like it either. My meaning is to seek practicality above all else. It would be even better if it had some educational nature! The day before New Year's Eve is even busier,

Preparing to celebrate the New Year;

Settling accounts, dividing bonuses,

Worshiping ghosts and gods and offering gifts;

Sending off the old and welcoming the new, staying up all night,

The sound of gongs and drums is loud, with joy and laughter;

Incense and flowers are placed in front of the hall,

The portrait of the God of Wealth is hung in the middle;

A pair of red candles is placed on the left and right,

There are also bowls and plates;

Paper ingots are gradually burned in the furnace,

Incense smoke curls in front of the gods;

Kowtowing a few times and praying,

"God of Wealth, please be convenient";

Words of good luck and prosperity are spoken,

There is an endless supply of surplus silver and wealth;

Congratulating the New Year for wealth and honor,

Children compete to add New Year's money;

The sound of firecrackers echoes far and near,

Intermittently like bombs;

Even in the great war, people are quiet,

Just like the "August 13th" incident of that year.

Xiaoer didn't see this situation and it was still okay,

But after seeing it, I feel heartbroken;

Our China is facing a national crisis and disaster,

Thanks to the leader for solving the crisis;

All good sons and daughters of China,

Would never stand by and do nothing;

Enduring humiliation and living is certainly not right,

Let alone celebrating the New Year happily;

In this year, many people cannot return home,

Many couples are not reunited;

Many people don't have three meals a day,

Many chimneys don't smoke;

Many people have nowhere to sell their blood and sweat,

Many people shed blood and sweat but have no rice and salt;

Many people starve to death on the roadside without the strength to bury them,

Many people sleep on the streets enduring hunger and cold;

Displacement is everywhere,

Do you think it's miserable or not?

I am celebrating the New Year happily now,

But it's not thoughtful at all;

This is exactly the uneven distribution of wealth and poverty,

Truly what is called "a divided plate of loose sand";

The more Xiaoer thinks about it, the more uncomfortable I feel,

Alas! It's even more unbearable in the midst of difficulty.

(White) Speaking of the New Year, it is really lively and extraordinary, with ten thousand families happy, singing and dancing in peace. Needless to say, the game fields are crowded with people, and on the road, you can only see brand new clothes and hats. This prosperity is really remarkable. It's just that many people who have been displaced and lost due to the war, like homeless dogs, cannot be equally happy, which is regrettable. That's why Xiaoer is unhappy this year. I neither worship gods nor perform rituals, and I have no money to help others. I really have no intention of seeking happiness. I just sit silently in the attic, teaching my younger brother to read. However, from time to time, I hear the sound of firecrackers, and my nerves are sensitive for a while, and I am a little frightened for some reason.

The road is very extraordinary,

There are women and men;

Men are dressed in new clothes like "A Fu,"

Women are powdered like mud Bodhisattvas;

Let's not talk about these things,

Just talk about one thing that is customary;

Dominoes and dice are in every household,

Some also play a few rounds of mahjong;

Regardless of day and night,

Regardless of early or late;

Gambling for money,

They are really buried in their work and work hard;

It's really uninteresting to waste your energy,

Your head is dizzy, your brain is dull, and your back is sore;

It's not easy to work hard for a year,

They gamble it away for three days and two nights;

The more they lose, the more they don't let go,

How will they pay off their gambling debts;

Some good friends turn against each other,

Some good brothers smash the table;

Some seek death in desperation after losing,

Some hang themselves and swallow opium;

Adults gamble, and children watch,

What about family education;

They learn bad habits from a young age,

It's hard to change when they grow up,

Gentlemen, listen to me,

Don't gamble anymore;

Xiaoer has many feelings in my heart,

But I can't finish saying it all because I'm not talented;

I'll write down this passage for now,

And submit it to the "Masses Weekly."

Refugees Selling Peanuts at the Yanping Road Self-Help Center

### Getting Rich

— Difficult Reporter

When meeting in the New Year, everyone clasps their hands, bows, and says, "Congratulations on getting rich!"

Everyone likes to accumulate wealth; But whether it is others' wishes or one's own hope, they don't say: "Congratulations on accumulating wealth," nor do they say: "Congratulations on accumulating wealth," but they just say: "Congratulations on getting rich."

"Getting Rich" means distributing; disseminating; releasing. It can be seen that if a person wants to "get rich", he must first "distribute" wealth; be willing to "distribute" wealth in order to "get rich".

To use a common saying, it's called "go out in the open, come in secret"; to use a literary saying, it's called "small goings and big comings"; Now, helping refugees is a "getting rich" opportunity and also a "getting rich" path. I hope every Shanghai person doesn't miss it!

Slice of Life

### The Life of an Apprentice

— Chen Junsheng

"Oyo, Mom!"

This low, deep, painful groan is what I, who have been in the store for less than two months, inevitably say every night when lying in bed. Then I think of my hometown under artillery fire and the face of my kind mother. The hair on her head was already gray when I left, and now it must be even more haggard. I came to Shanghai from my hometown last April to learn a trade. Through a friend's introduction, I am apprenticed in a Tianjin restaurant. In addition to the master and mistress, there is also a younger apprentice in the store. He is only four years old this year, and there are two older chefs and me, a total of six people. I get up at four o'clock in the morning to carry the door panels, sweep the floor, and start the stove, and all sorts of chores. When I have free time, I take the younger apprentice for a walk. It's still okay. After half a month, the master asked me to take steamed buns and sell them in the nearby area. "Do you want some, hot steamed buns!" Places like teahouses, hotels, bathhouses, used goods stalls, and vegetable markets, rain or shine. If I sell a few less, I will be scolded by the master and beaten by the mistress. The mistress has a small temper and is fierce. When she is happy, if I sell a few less steamed buns, she will roll her eyes at you a few times. When she is unhappy (or loses money playing mahjong), ah, that's terrible. I will have to taste the weapon in her old lady's hand. The only weapon to beat me is an iron poker for the stove. That iron poker is thick and hard. If it hits the body, it will immediately leave a bruise that won't heal for three to five days. Therefore, every night I caress the scars on my body and even cry about the depravity of my fate. Ah Sheng, what are you doing? You little ghost, are you trying to die again! These words are almost my daily routine. Ah, who will pity my life? Indeed, besides my mother, who else is there? But I will never be so weak and decadent. I must struggle out of my bright and free path in a difficult environment.

### Weekly War Report

Guangzhou and Qiongdao

On the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Yuehan, and Guangzhou-Sanshui Railways, there were no major changes this past week. However, at Dongguan and Taiping, Japanese troops, with combined infantry and artillery, attacked the Chinese army's Xian'an positions. Another unit landed at Nantou, coordinating with the Japanese forces at Dongguan and Taiping. The Chinese defenders fought bravely, but due to a significant disparity in numbers, their positions shifted slightly. Later, reinforcements of the Chinese army arrived, and Bao'an was retaken, forcing the Japanese to retreat to the Humen area. On Hainan Island, the Japanese forces at Haikou, Qiongshan, and Chengmai faced a large-scale counter-offensive by the Chinese united forces, causing considerable difficulty for the Japanese. Suffering losses, the Japanese engaged in widespread arson and murder in the area. They are currently striving to advance, but aiming for a quick victory, additional Japanese troops landed at Sanya Bay in the island's south, advancing towards Yulin to create a diversion. The Chinese side is prepared, constructing fortifications and engaging in steadfast defense. (Note: The sudden Japanese attack on Hainan Island is intended to intensify the war in South China, block international arms supplies, and accelerate the occupation of Guangdong and Guangxi. Another purpose is to threaten Britain and France, as the occupation of Qiongdao would put Hong Kong and Indochina in a precarious situation. Therefore, Britain and France are now seeking to unite against Japan, but no concrete action has yet been taken.)

Shanxi Province

Since the Chinese army in southern Shanxi inflicted a defeat on the Japanese south of Zhongtiao Mountain, there have been intense battles in areas north of the mountain, including Jiexian, Anyi, Wenxi, and Tiao County. Recently, the Chinese army has occupied northwest Jiexian, and the Chinese army has also retaken strongholds in Anyi and Wenxi. Unwilling to accept defeat, the Japanese have released large amounts of tear gas in an attempt to gain an advantage. A stalemate continues. In eastern Shanxi, the Chinese army is besieging Heshun.

Hunan and Hubei Provinces

The front lines in northern and central Hubei are quiet. However, at Jinniu Town in southern Hubei, the Japanese forces were subjected to a large-scale attack by the Chinese army. Due to the intense Chinese artillery fire, the Japanese seemed to have suffered losses. Later, in an attempt to break the siege, the Japanese released large amounts of poison gas in a desperate resistance. Unexpectedly, the wind direction suddenly changed, turning to their disadvantage. Seeing an opportunity, the Chinese army advanced bravely and was able to recapture Jinniu. In addition, the important locations of Jinkou and Huanglingji southwest of Wuchang were successively retaken. In this campaign, the Chinese guerrillas were able to control traffic and launch surprise attacks, achieving remarkable success.

Other Areas

At Fanchang in southern Anhui, the Japanese army engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army. It is reported that Commander Nagasawa's unit also suffered heavy damage. In addition, 3,000 troops of the puppet army under Zhou Xuanchen in Xuzhou, over 2,000 troops of the puppet army under Liu Hushen in northern Sui, and 3,000 troops under Yu Zhiqian have all defected and returned to the Nationalist side. Furthermore, the Chinese air force has been quite active in recent days, reportedly shooting down as many as nine Japanese planes in the Lanzhou area.

### One Aspect of New Year's Life

Spring and Autumn

### Production, Education, and Sales Group

— Xin Meng

Fifty male and female members - Excellent results after one year of establishment

Recently, the problem of providing relief to the tens of thousands of refugees in Shanghai has become increasingly difficult. Those in charge have realized that it is better to provide refugees with production education, enabling them to support themselves, than to have them sit idle and rely on charity for a long time. Therefore, the slogan of promoting refugee production education is being loudly proclaimed. At the same time, this reminds me of the Production, Education, and Sales Group run by the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge area, which has been in existence for a full year and has achieved excellent results, serving as a model for those concerned about refugee production education.

After the war moved away from Shanghai, the YMCA launched a Production, Education, and Sales Group with the aim of providing relief to young men and women who lost their jobs and were unable to make a living during the war. It recruited 50 members, providing them with education while enabling them to produce goods and support themselves. After the news spread, many people applied, and the group soon reached its full quota, with a portion of the members being women. After a considerable period of training, the male and female members began their sales work.

The goods sold by the members were all products from domestic factories, which the YMCA had arranged beforehand on a consignment basis. That is, the members would return the cost of the goods after they were sold and receive a commission. Every day, the 50 male and female members carried heavy leather briefcases and rattan bags full of goods, rushing around to earn a living. In the summer, they were drenched in sweat under the scorching sun, and in the winter, they were blown by the bitter wind until their noses ran. Their spirit of hard work and endurance evoked sympathy from those who witnessed it.

They, or she, went to residential areas. Standing in front of people's doors, they smilingly asked you to buy their goods. Their humble attitude and courteous manner made people admire them. After the goods were displayed, they didn't complain even if you didn't buy anything. They would even further explain that the goods they carried were all products from first-class domestic factories, and the prices were exactly the same as those in the stores outside. Buying their goods would not only save you money and time, avoiding the need to go outside, but also provide relief and help to them, which is equivalent to doing a good deed, wouldn't it be killing two birds with one stone? As a result, people were persuaded to buy their goods even if they didn't want to.

Regardless of gender, their clothing was very simple. No matter how many miles they had to walk each day, they always walked, without taking a car. The goods they sold were mostly everyday household items, while the female members carried more cosmetics and women's products. After running around all day, they could make about ten yuan in business if they were lucky. After deducting a 10% commission, they could earn about one yuan in income, so they could earn more than ten to twenty yuan a month. As for their living arrangements, they usually rented a room with several other people, and some cooked their own meals while others bought food to eat. Their lives were thoroughly proletarian, so what they earned through their labor was barely enough to get by.

This Production, Education, and Sales Group has been in existence for a year. In the past year, 50 unemployed men and women have been able to find work and support themselves, which is of course thanks to the organizers of the YMCA. This kind of relief for refugees is certainly much better than simply raising donations from all sectors and having the refugees sit idle. It's just that the YMCA's Production, Education, and Sales Group is limited to only 50 members, which is too few to allow the majority of unemployed refugees to have goods to sell and support themselves. And since no other organizations have followed the YMCA's example in running similar sales groups, it makes us feel that it is insufficient.

### If I Were King

— Yan Hua

"If I Were King"

Paramount Production, Grand Light Theatre

I haven't read the history of François Villon, and I don't know the true story of this great 15th-century French poet, but I feel that this film, through modern thinking and criticism, has become a strong modern fighter who leads the people to defend their country.

At least, this kind of historical costume film has its accurate and clear revelation, that is, don't underestimate the power of the people, they are the most loyal and brave warriors of the country. No matter in what kind of political system, the military force of the people cannot be underestimated. An autocratic and tyrannical government will inevitably collapse, and a government that is deeply supported by the people must be a government of the people. This was true in the past, and it is certainly true now. When fascist countries are now coercing their people to engage in aggressive warfare, we can resolutely predict that these aggressive groups of countries will one day be overthrown. And what is the main driving force behind the overthrow of their governments? Needless to say, it is still the people!

"If I Were King" is still full of heroes, beauties, and romantic sentiments, but it gives us a great lesson. The whole story is about 15th-century Paris, France, which was surrounded by the Burgundians. At that time, the generals under King Louis XI of France were unwilling to fight, but Villon, a great French poet who grew up in the slums of Paris, led the people of the whole city to fight the Burgundians, and finally defeated and drove back the Burgundians. However, because the generals of the court were jealous of him, the poet, who had retired after his success, quietly left Paris.

Throughout the story, there are many things that are worth learning: King Louis XI was indeed surprised that Villon could use the people. For example, Louis himself often tried the people and hanged them, while Villon not only did not hang them, but gave them gold coins, which could not but surprise and admire Louis; After Villon defeated the Burgundians, King Louis did not reuse him, but said to him: "You should leave quickly, as long as you are here, I will not have peace for a day"! From this, it can be seen that Louis XI still did not value the military force of the people; Because of the昏庸 of successive French kings Louis, it naturally created a historical consequence that could not be violated, that is, the famous French Revolution in later history. The main driving force of this revolution, as mentioned earlier, was still the people!

As for the performance, under the magnificent power of the great director Frank Lloyd, he showed three characteristics in the presentation of the whole play: The cartoonization of the characters: Here, he made several main characters of the whole play humorous, such as Villon's light and agile, his escape and teasing of the Imperial Guard, making the audience feel a kind of chic and witty liking for Villon; Secondly, the character of King Louis XI washed away the heavy and solemn feeling of ordinary emperors, and in various postures, such as the sharp laughter, the twitching of the corners of the mouth, and the trembling of the walking posture, he wrote King Louis into a rather funny weirdo; The richness of the emotional atmosphere: such as when Villon was drinking and cheering wildly with the crowd in the slums, the Imperial Guard suddenly followed and provoked a fight; When fighting the Burgundians, the girl Hu Jie in the slums was injured and died. In a sad and tragic atmosphere, Villon carried her to the church, and when he kissed her trembling lips, she died; The strength of the capture of the crowd scene: Villon distributed all the food in the king's treasury to the people, and they cheered; Villon led the people to attack the Burgundians, and the war scene was lively and exciting; These can be said to be the most brilliant features of the whole film.

Therefore, I think, "If I Were King" is still a more powerful masterpiece among the foreign films shown during the Spring Festival.

Among the actors, Ronald Colman, who played the great French poet Villon, showed his chic, witty, and witty side very well, but in terms of being handsome and brave, Colman was not strong enough due to his physique; Basil Rathbone, who played King Louis XI, has always played tough roles. Here, his whole tone and walking posture have completely changed. Those who are used to watching his plays ("The Iron Duke" and "Robin Hood", etc., he played very important roles) will definitely be interested in the role he plays now; Frances Dee played Princess Katherine, the play is not much, but it is very warm and gentle, she is an actress who can act.

### Willing to Die Eating Pufferfish

— Mo Dian

We have a saying that goes, "Willing to die eating pufferfish"; however, news of pufferfish poisoning is still often seen. It is said that pufferfish has a rich, delicious, and fresh taste, but if it is not cooked carefully, it can cause poisoning. There was a teahouse in Shanghai that used "specially hired experts to cook pufferfish" as one of its featured foods, but in the end, not many people ate it; and now this teahouse has also been converted into a theater.

Yesterday, I found a news item in the evening paper about a family poisoned by eating pufferfish. Are these people really gambling with their lives and appetites? They would never be so foolish. The reason why news of pufferfish poisoning is repeatedly seen is because of "greed". They clearly know that eating pufferfish is life-threatening, but when delicious food is in front of them, they can't help but move their index fingers. When they pick up their chopsticks and wolf down the food, they have long put their lives out of their minds. If they are lucky enough not to die, they will raise their thumbs and show that they have the courage to "willing to die eating pufferfish". Otherwise, when they are on their deathbeds, they will also make fun of themselves so as not to die as "hungry ghosts".

Now our "friendly country" is also acting as a "hero" by eating pufferfish. At first, they really felt it was delicious and raised their thumbs to boast about themselves, but the pufferfish in their stomachs eventually acted up. Once it acts up, even if there are skilled doctors, they will only pour soapy water to do their best. Their fate is only a matter of time.

### Automobile Permit No. 1 and Driver No. 1

— Wan Erbei

Everyone knows that cars driving on Shanghai roads must have a "permit". The most recently issued car "permits" must have numbers exceeding 10,000, which shows that there are at least 10,000 cars in Shanghai, including private cars and taxis, as well as private transport vehicles and rental transport vehicles. The difference between private cars and taxis can be seen on the "permit": the former is black background with white characters, and the latter is white background with black characters. As for transport vehicles, the difference is that private vehicles are also black background with white characters, while rental vehicles are yellow background with white characters.

Every day we see car numbers on the road that are ten, hundred, thousand, or ten thousand, but we have never seen a car with permit No. 1. So, does permit No. 1 exist? Yes! It is said that the owner of permit No. 1 is surnamed Zhou. This permit No. 1 was issued as early as the early years of the Republic of China, which shows that the Zhou family was very wealthy back then. Of course, there is only one original permit No. 1, and there will never be a second one, so it is very precious, and its owner also regards it as a rarity, thinking it is very prestigious. However, the car with permit No. 1 is already an "old-timer car", so it has been kept in the garage and never comes out. The owner of this "old-timer car" has never stopped paying the monthly fees in order to keep permit No. 1; otherwise, the Car Management Office would revoke this permit No. 1.

Not just anyone can drive a car. Car drivers all have a driver's license, and this driver's license must be obtained after passing two rigorous examinations. Driver's licenses have now been issued up to more than 20,000. It is said that the nickname of the person who obtained driver's license No. 1 is Xiaomeilang, but his name is unknown. Xiaomeilang passed away a long time ago. During his lifetime, he drove a car for the Jewish tycoon Silas Aaron Hardoon. At that time, there was also a story related to car permit No. 1.

Because Hardoon only had driver No. 1 and no car No. 1, he once asked someone to negotiate with the Zhou family, willing to pay a large sum of money to buy their car permit No. 1. The Zhou family answered humorously: "Hardoon wants car permit No. 1 because he has driver No. 1, and he is prepared to have two No. 1s; and we have car permit No. 1, since Hardoon has driver No. 1, then we would rather pay a special wage to hire a driver No. 1!..." As a result, of course, Hardoon regretted being underground in Shanghai.

Making ideas on car permits is also a common phenomenon, such as the same number of digits or consecutive numbers, which is probably what is called "decorative beauty", right? At the same time, there are indeed some people who use sitting in a car as "decorative beauty", but in reality, they are "empty big officials".

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 4: Tracing Past Events, Le Tian Transmits Wonderful Words; Establishing New Friendship, Scenic Spot Makes a Pure Excursion

Zhu Airen said, "Is it far? That doesn't matter. I have my own car here. I'll take you back to school later, so you can rest assured. Where do you want to go?" Wu Junsu said, "I've heard that many people have been going to Stone Lake for sightseeing these past few days. Have you been there?" Zhu Airen frowned and said, "Oh dear! My Miss Wu! Professor Wu! I'm so busy with the hospital, where would I find the time to go sightseeing at Stone Lake? All day long, all I see are the faces of patients, and all I hear are the voices of patients. Today, I took a leave of absence to pick up the two sisters. It's truly 'stealing half a day of leisure from a busy life.' Please guide us to go sightseeing. Stone Lake is fine. But is there a place to eat there?" Wu Junsu said, "Why wouldn't there be? There's everything there now." The four of them left the train station. Zhu Airen went to the parking area, found the car, and headed towards Stone Lake. During this time, Zhu Airen was an experienced driver because she was a doctor and often went out to see patients. Sometimes, when there was an emergency, she had to drive fast. The two He sisters could also drive, but they weren't very skilled because their family was used to using chauffeurs, and chauffeurs always drove. Only Wu Junsu absolutely could not drive. She put it well, saying, "I don't have a car yet. When I have a car, it won't be too late to learn to drive." Wu Junsu also had one shortcoming, which was nearsightedness. Although she wore glasses, she was still at a disadvantage. There are two types of nearsightedness, one is congenital and the other is acquired. Congenital nearsightedness is hereditary, like Wu Junsu's nearsightedness, which is congenital because her father was also nearsighted. Acquired nearsightedness is when the parents are not nearsighted, but the children suddenly become nearsighted. This may be due to other reasons. Recently, because many people in Jiangnan are nearsighted, this issue has also aroused discussion in the medical community, and they are eager to find a way to correct it. Let's say that although Wu Junsu doesn't have a car, she doesn't feel inconvenienced. Because in urban areas, there are public buses everywhere. If you want a specially hired car, there are also many car rental companies, and the prices are very cheap. On average, it only costs half a dollar every 20 minutes, and there are no tips, which is much cheaper than before the war. Not to mention Shanghai, a densely populated place, but even in Suzhou, various public buses, long-distance buses, and small cars shuttle back and forth like shuttles. There is also a public bus from the train station to You Lake, but the public bus stops at every stop, which is relatively slow. (47)

### Prospects for Traditional Opera (1)

— Yu Tang

Mr. Yu Tang is a famous critic of opera. He recently wrote this article specially for this magazine to fully discuss the improvement of traditional opera, with high-level arguments, which is a rare masterpiece. The full text is about 4,000 words and will be published in installments for readers. (Editor)

Recently, I have heard people wanting to improve traditional opera, and even some people respecting a certain female performer as an advanced female performer. A few years ago, I would have been happy to join in the fun, but now I dare not blindly agree, because I have a new understanding of the future status of traditional opera.

Mr. Liao advocated in this magazine to regard Peking Opera and Kun Opera as national operas. Six or seven years ago, I also drafted an article with the same opinion and shouted loudly; at that time, I analyzed from the traditional opera itself the several immortal qualities it possessed, and then compared it with spoken drama, film, and other new local dramas, judging the greatness of traditional opera and predicting its immortality. In order to increase the status of traditional opera, I also gathered several like-minded comrades who were enthusiastic about studying traditional opera to discuss how to improve the declining traditional opera: from the actors' physique, knowledge, personality, clothing review, script awareness, rhetoric, to the improvement of musical instruments, the configuration of lights, the construction of the stage, etc., all were used as research objects, and after being smug for a while, in the end, because of lack of perseverance and economy, nothing was achieved. In recent years, I don't know whether it is because of a thorough understanding of traditional opera or because of backward thinking, I suddenly began to greatly doubt the future of traditional opera, which I had always thought was bright and brilliant, and I felt that the previous efforts were too incomplete. After several painful thoughts, I got a new theory and calculated the future fate of traditional opera; this is not to say that traditional opera will disappear from now on, but to say that traditional opera will eventually lose its past glory due to its inability to resist the impact of the torrent of the times.

Traditional opera itself is an epoch-making art, which no one can deny; but any art must have a close relationship with real life before it can have a large audience. With a large audience, it can be promoted and immortalized. Conversely, an art that loses its connection with life loses its audience; without an audience, it cannot avoid the fate of decline. To put it nicely, it is something that is locked in an ivory tower, which cannot be accepted by people on the street. For example, writing is to convey thoughts, which originally has a great relationship with life; later, someone wrote a good hand and was called a calligrapher, and he had an audience. Now, someone is famous for writing oracle bone inscriptions and stone drum inscriptions, but there are naturally very few appreciators, because it is not connected with real life. Traditional opera is a product of the times, and its consciousness and technology are adapted to the feudal society of old China. After many local refinements, removing the dross and preserving the essence, it created a special and glorious position. But now times are different, and people's thinking patterns have undergone great changes. The rise of movies and spoken dramas has quickly snatched away a large part of its audience. If Peking Opera did not rely on its own popularity to cater to the general public, it would have disappeared along with Kun Opera.

### Chaplin's Talking Problem

— Idiot

Hollywood's Wild Speculation and Numerous Rumors

Not long ago, news came from Hollywood that the comedian Chaplin, in retaliation for Germany's ban on his humorous works, was preparing to shoot a film called "The Dictator." Chaplin is against sound films. It has been ten years since sound films became popular and replaced silent films. However, during these ten years, Chaplin has never spoken on the screen, nor has he directed a sound film. However, his new film "The Dictator" is a sound film, and he will also speak on the screen. Thus, how Chaplin will speak on the screen has become a problem, and it is a great source of conversation in the film city of Hollywood.

What does Chaplin's voice sound like in the microphone now? This question has been resolved, because he has broadcast on the radio several times. So, the mystery is how he will speak on the screen? If Chaplin changes his past prejudice of remaining silent on the screen, and his future new film is a sound film, what kind of dialogue will he adopt, and will he show his past smile in his debut sound film? That is another question.

According to Al Reeves, who is close to Chaplin: "Chaplin will shoot at least three sound films in the future, but this is all accidental, and it may be abandoned after the plan is finalized. When Chaplin first speaks on the screen, the words he says will all be monosyllabic." Al Reeves is Chaplin's business manager, so he naturally knows more about Chaplin than people do. In the past, Hollywood has repeatedly reported that Chaplin planned to shoot sound films, but Reeves always said it was untrue. Afterwards, people really knew that Chaplin did not have such a plan.

In the past, Chaplin often discussed sound film issues with his friends. Some of his friends believed that Chaplin would permanently remain a silent mime star, but others believed that for the sake of his career, he would slowly enter the realm of sound films. However, any speculation is castles in the air. It will not be confirmed until the last minute when Chaplin's sound film starts shooting or is officially released. Therefore, although the news that Chaplin is filming "The Dictator" has spread from the film city, whether it is a sound film and whether Chaplin himself will speak, everything will have to wait until the premiere to be confirmed.

Chaplin only has one photography studio in Hollywood. Painters and carpenters are busy working there. When each film is being shot, the photography studio is always silent and very quiet, unlike other photography studios where sound is constantly coming out when shooting sound films. Chaplin himself is very busy planning or directing every shot. If he also wants to be in the shot, his assistant Cade Heaven will take over the directing work. After a scene is shot, Chaplin sits alone in a canvas chair, with his hands behind his head. No one talks to him, and even reporters dare not approach him? Because this is when he is thinking, and no one can interrupt his train of thought. Every break between shots is like this, and the photography studio is always silent. But if he really wants to shoot a sound film, then this kind of calm atmosphere may have to change.

### Shaw's Humor

— Considering an Award as an Insult

(Associated Press, London, 24th) Today, Shaw declared in his usual tone: "Hollywood's promotion of his Pygmalion as the best screenplay of the year and the awarding of a medal to him is a great insult to him." Shaw said: "Their giving me a medal is a great insult to me. Why don't they also give King George VI a medal, because George is the only emperor in Britain at the moment." (Note: Pygmalion was the king of Cyprus, who was in love with a stone statue.)

### Zhu Yanan Will Return to the Stage

— Liu Zhenghu

May Go to Ping to Join a Troupe in Late Spring, Otherwise Will Reappear in Shanghai

Ms. Zhu Yanan, a famous female dan, went to sea from amateur status ten years ago and became famous in Shanghai and Wuhan. She was very popular for a while. Later, after the death of Zhu Naigeng (a famous amateur), she gave up her singing career and lived a hard life! In daily life, in addition to managing the family, she specializes in tutoring her children, and in her spare time, she still practices singing, never interrupting. We have not heard the news of her comeback for a long time, and fans are looking forward to it. At the beginning of the lunar year, the author met her at the Cao mansion and saw her beautiful face, which was clearer and thinner than in the past, and her charm was undiminished. Her natural dimples are especially beautiful. In the past, some opera connoisseurs regarded her as the Mei Lanfang of the female singer world, which is no exaggeration. Her superior artistic skills and unparalleled talent are beyond the reach of later generations. Therefore, she and Ms. Hua (Huilin) were known as equally outstanding talents for a time. It is a pity that fate is unkind to this person, both afflicting her fate and grinding her body. Her heart is depressed, and her stomach disease occurs frequently. After medical examination with X-rays, it was found that her stomach was drooping. Recently, due to being home in seclusion and long-term recuperation, she has recovered. Ms. Zhu said to me: "This year, I have sent my children to school to study, and Zhu Yanan can concentrate on returning to the stage. At the end of the old year, Master Lin San (Shusen) once invited me to join a new troupe, but I couldn't because of illness. Once my weak body recovers, at the latest in late spring and early summer, I plan to go to Ping for a try. If there is a suitable opportunity in Shanghai, I might as well return to the stage. At that time, if I show my clumsiness, I hope you will give me a lot of guidance." I said: "We are our own people, and it is our duty." Ms. Zhu also said: "Singing opera requires capital (referring to the voice). Yanan feels that her physique is weak, and she is afraid that the capital will not be enough, so recently she would rather hide her clumsiness at home and dare not act rashly." I think that Ms. Zhu's heart is as pure as an orchid, and her words are extremely sincere. Moreover, she raises her children and inherits her art, and her ambition is commendable and her situation is pitiful. Therefore, I write a brief outline, and I think those who care about Ms. Zhu's life and art will be happy to hear it.

### Zhang Wenjuan Adds Wings to a Tiger

— Pu Zhang

Zhang Wenjuan has become popular in Shanghai this year. Music lovers praise her as a rare genius in the Peking Opera world. Her art, voice, and appearance are all beautiful, and the plays she performs follow the rules and are completely standard. The Ping Opera seniors Ding Song, Su Shaoqing, and Zheng Guoyi have said that she is the only one who can follow in the footsteps of Xiao Dong. This is well-founded. In the past few months, Ms. Zhang has newly learned plays such as Dingjun Mountain, Zhuteng Village, Wenzhao Pass, Zhuangyuan Pu, and Meilong Town, all taught by the famous teacher Chen Xiuhua. It is said that they will be performed in the Times in the New Year. Recently, the famous clown Lu Qingyuan joined the Times through the introduction of the famous Jing He Yingkui and Hou Jiankun. Lu is a talented student of Wang Changlin. He once played with Yu Shuyan on the stage, asking the woodcutter in "Woodcutter" (the entire Fan Zhongyu) and the teacher in "Killing the Family of Fishermen," and they were known as the best in the world. From then on, Ms. Zhang added wings to a tiger and became even more colorful.

### Secret History of the Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (115)

— Xu Muyun

The few segments of Siping Tune (that is, Pingban Erhuang) sung by Lao Tan in the play and the "One Word Angers Song Jiang" and the two large segments of Xipi Yuanban, of course, have many good tunes. Even the recitations and expressions when answering with Yan Xijiao are extremely good. The most amazing skill is that when Xijiao said that there was a letter but it would not be handed over until the Yancheng County Hall, Lao Tan immediately showed a distraught and frightened expression, sat on the chair, and was stunned. At this time, the tall square scarf on his head, somehow, would suddenly stand up straight like Chaplin's spring-loaded top hat. At this time, both his arms and hands were hanging down. He did not use his wrists to help, nor did anyone behind the stage lift the square scarf for him, and of course, he would not imitate Chaplin's spring hat. How it stood up is a very doubtful and strange thing. Therefore, everyone rushed to the backstage after his play to inquire about the truth. Lao Tan said to the crowd: "At the beginning, our master Zhang Shengkui (that is, the sworn brother who once scolded Lao Tan) performed this play the best, especially in expressing this kind of frightened expression. His eyes seemed to be fixed. People often say that someone died of fright. His expression can really be expressed with his eyes. Unfortunately, I have small eyes by nature, and these working places are too difficult for me. However, I am in this business, and the most important thing is to sell a good one at the "critical moment." It is not to shout for people to praise you randomly in whatever place. That kind of hard to be good or desperately to be good singing and acting is called "liang gou xie" by us insiders, which is what Pear Garden people with a little status are unwilling to do. Moreover, the real insiders in the audience are staring at you intently when the play is performed to this kind of "highlight." If the performer does not sell a good one in this place, then they will express great disappointment, either blaming you for being lazy or criticizing you for not putting effort into this play. Because my eyes are small, I cannot completely follow our master's performance to please the audience, and I am unwilling to violate our internal rules of whether to sell or not. Therefore, I put in a lot of hard work and practiced for many years before I developed this unique skill."
