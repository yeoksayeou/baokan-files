The first three days were devoted to reports, focusing on the difficulties faced by various armies. The latter two days were spent discussing proposals, all in accordance with the spirit of the Changsha and Nanyue conferences, and several implementation measures were agreed upon. Each war zone will practice coordinated offensive tactics and observe each other's performance. Bai Chongxi stated in his address that the enemy has suffered 700,000 casualties, mobilized 1.5 million troops, and used up to 32 divisions, spending twenty months.

Southern Hubei and Northern Hunan: Japanese Troops Hemmed into a Corner; Facing Unprecedented Difficulties; Constantly Repelled by the Chinese Army Near the Suburbs of Tongyue

Changsha: Continuous rain in Southern Hubei and Northern Hunan has quieted the battlefield. The Japanese troops entrenched in Tongcheng and Yuezhou are reinforcing their fortifications, preparing for a long defense. Observers believe that the Japanese army has encountered unprecedented and significant difficulties since invading the Xiang-E Highway and the northern section of the Yuehan Railway. The most obvious difficulties are as follows: First, the Japanese army is closely monitored on all sides by regular Chinese troops and guerrilla units, and is constantly subjected to surprise attacks and ambushes. Advancing means sinking deeper and deeper, while retreating means facing thorns everywhere. Second, in the mountainous areas of the Hunan-Hubei border region, modern transportation tools have become ineffective. Even minor troop movements require crossing paddy fields or climbing mountains. Not only is it impossible to move heavy weapons, but even foot soldiers suffer from the difficulty of travel. This kind of primitive living is by no means something that the Japanese army can adapt to. Third, morale is growing stronger with each battle. Every household is increasingly filled with hatred for the enemy and a desire for revenge. They have thoroughly understood the deception and enslavement of the Japanese and are even more willing to contribute all they have to meet the Chinese army's needs. The military and the people have formed an even stronger cooperative front, making it impossible for the Japanese army to implement its evil schemes. As a result, for four months, the Japanese troops who invaded the Hunan-Hubei border region have been constantly repelled by the Chinese army near the suburbs of Tongcheng and Yuezhou, making no progress whatsoever.

### Anti-War Sentiment Among Japanese Soldiers Growing Stronger Daily

(Hong Kong) Tokyo Dispatch: (1) The Japanese Ministry of the Army has recently transferred all commanders on various fronts who are suspected of being anti-war back to Japan. The number is quite large, causing great consternation in Japanese government and society. Kikuchi Takeo, a member of the Japanese House of Peers, severely questioned Itagaki in the Diet the other day. According to Itagaki's reply, commanders should not be transferred lightly without special necessity, but allowing such anti-war elements to remain in the troops could lead to incalculable consequences. The government's actions in this matter are truly unavoidable. (2) Anti-war sentiment has also been growing stronger in the Kwantung Army recently. Over four hundred people have been transferred back to Japan on suspicion of being anti-war, and seventy-two of them have been executed. (Telegram on the 10th)

### Commemorating the Founding Father and the Second Phase of the War of Resistance Propaganda Week

Today is the 14th anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China. At this time, the Republic of China founded by Dr. Sun is struggling in extreme suffering; Dr. Sun's Zhongshan Mausoleum, where he is buried, has also been occupied by demons for a year and three months. Every Chinese citizen today cannot help but feel infinite sorrow! Especially the citizens of the isolated island (Shanghai), even the most common way to commemorate Dr. Sun today, such as planting trees, is restricted by bayonets, and there is no way to go to the suburbs. How tragic and indignant is this! However, what use is there in commemorating the Founding Father solely with emotional sorrow and indignation?

Dr. Sun Yat-sen has been dead for fourteen years, and these fourteen years represent half the time that the Republic of China has existed since its founding. During this half of the time, China has been facing a crisis that Dr. Sun did not live to see, but that he had anticipated. All of Dr. Sun's instructions to his followers and the people were designed as solutions based on this accurate prediction. If Dr. Sun were still alive today, the only instruction he would give to the Chinese people would be resistance, because only resistance can accomplish Dr. Sun's lifelong commitment to "China's freedom and equality." The value of the greatest figures in history is often discovered more and more over time. Dr. Sun's great spirit has been accumulated year after year in this way, and on the 14th anniversary of his death today, that is, nearly two years into the War of Resistance, it is even more radiant, illuminating the universe.

We can illustrate how Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit becomes greater over time from the following examples. First, Dr. Sun was the first person in China to discover the power of the people. His loud call to "awaken the people" indeed resulted in the success of the Great Revolution of the 15th and 16th years of the Republic due to the cooperation of the people. Unfortunately, the power of the people was ignored in the subsequent ten years, until the sound of the cannons of the War of Resistance sounded, and the people's movement was actively noted again, and the cornerstone of the final victory was laid on the unified strength of the people. Second, Dr. Sun's instruction that China's way out must be to "unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally and fight together" has not been actively developed during the past ten years. Until the recent process of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people realized that the country that Dr. Sun wished to associate with before his death was indeed China's first true friend. At the same time, certain European and American powers have also been inspired by the spirit of China's War of Resistance and have become closely linked with China; and China, under the principle of "those who have the Way find much assistance," must also use the assistance of friendly countries to complete the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction. Third, when Dr. Sun reorganized the Kuomintang in the early part of the 13th year of the Republic, he accommodated the inclusion of communists to jointly participate in the National Revolution of the Three People's Principles, which indeed shone brightly in the history of the revolution of the 15th and 16th years of the Republic. Unfortunately, in the following ten years, the two major parties went from friends to enemies, resulting in a long period of civil war, which reduced countless valuable national strength. Until the foreign troubles became increasingly urgent, the call for a united front resounded throughout the land, and the Kuomintang and the Communist Party once again sincerely cooperated, and the great work of resistance and national reconstruction could be effectively carried out. The above are several examples of Dr. Sun's great enlightenment, which have gradually been recognized as truth due to the progress of time and facts. However, above the above points, Dr. Sun also left two precious treasures to the Chinese people: one is the Three People's Principles, which indicate the highest principles for China's national construction; and the other is a wise leader who leads China's actual national construction work. These two treasures are the true core of national revival and the construction of a new China, and China can only rely on the operation of this core to become stronger and stronger in war and move towards the road to victory. In short, when the Chinese people commemorate Dr. Sun today, they should transcend emotional sorrow, use reason and will, recognize his immortal and great spirit, undoubtedly follow his teachings, and under the leadership of the leader he left to the people, jointly complete the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction.

Today is also the first day of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance Propaganda Week in Shanghai. Five months have passed since the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance. Facts have shown that China's War of Resistance has now entered a favorable stage. All aspects, whether military, political, reconstruction, or cultural, are revealing a glimmer of dawn. However, in order to promote the early arrival of dawn, it is necessary to make everyone understand the characteristics of the second phase of the War of Resistance and to universally develop the work of resistance and national reconstruction. The citizens of Shanghai today may well take participation in the War of Resistance Propaganda Week as a concrete expression of their commemoration of the Premier. Regardless of gender or occupation, everyone should do their best and contribute their strength. Before today, some may or may not have actively participated in the work of resistance and national reconstruction; from today onwards, everyone must actively participate.

### Guiding Principles of the National Spiritual Mobilization: Gather the National Spirit Towards a Common Goal, Establish the Same Patriotic Morality for Oneself, and Firmly Establish the Same Nation-Building Faith for the Nation

Chongqing: Guiding Principles of the National Spiritual Mobilization,

(1) Introduction: Since the start of the War of Resistance, more than a year and a half has passed. Thanks to the solidarity of our entire nation and the courage of our soldiers, we have frustrated the arrogance of the enemy and depleted their strength. Our national reputation has increased, and the world looks at us with new eyes. However, the second phase of the War of Resistance has now begun. The days ahead are long, and the efforts our people need to make to overcome the difficulties will be even greater than in the previous phase. The enemy now knows that military force alone is not enough to subdue us and achieve their goals. Therefore, their latest plan is to use various methods to shake our will and threaten our spirit. We are well aware of the profound foreign threats in our country's history, all because the officials and scholars were intimidated by the enemy in spirit and failed to exert the strong power of our nation everywhere. The examples of the Song and Ming dynasties serve as a profound lesson. Therefore, those in positions of responsibility today should pay particular attention to invigorating and concentrating the spirit. In short, in the past, the War of Resistance emphasized both military affairs and spirit. However, in the second phase, which is the later stage of the War of Resistance, spirit is undoubtedly more important than military affairs. Only the strong and unyielding spirit of the entire nation can overcome difficulties and break the enemy's insidious plan to win through spiritual subjugation. Looking back at the struggles of the past eighteen months and examining our shortcomings, the lack of material conditions is indeed obvious, but the inadequacy of spiritual conditions is even more difficult to deny. Modern warfare is a war of total national mobilization. Therefore, we must not only mobilize all domestic materials and manpower, but also mobilize the spirit of the entire nation. To mobilize the spirit of the entire nation to enrich the national strength for the War of Resistance, it is not only important to initiate, but also to organize. We must use organized spirit to unleash organized manpower and utilize organized materials to meet the current needs of the nation. Moreover, the significance of this War of Resistance is not only limited to eliminating the invasion of the brutal enemy, but also lies in striving to establish a permanent foundation for national construction after the war. The importance of the task and the greatness of the mission will be unprecedented in our country's history. Looking back at today's society, although the foundation of unity has been laid, spiritual unity has not yet been achieved. Although expressions of loyalty, courage, and striving are abundant, a state of decadence and disorganization also exists simultaneously. The organization is lax, and the foundation is weak. How can such a national spirit bear the great responsibility of the nation's rise and fall? Looking at the past and considering the future, we cannot but recognize that the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization is the most urgent task today. The so-called National Spiritual Mobilization, in terms of its literal meaning, means that for individuals, it is to concentrate all their consciousness, thoughts, wisdom, and spiritual strength in one direction and improve its use. For the entire nation, it is to concentrate the spiritual strength of all citizens of different ages, occupations, thoughts, and lives on one goal and jointly encourage it to enhance it, regulate it to unleash it, and determine the center of organization to enhance the efficiency of its unleashing. However, the expression of spiritual strength is morality, and its unleashing must be based on faith. The ancients said, "Success or failure depends on one or two." This is true in all things, especially in military affairs, especially when our people are in a battle where survival is at stake. Therefore, in today's China, the meaning of National Spiritual Mobilization should be to gather the spirit of the entire nation towards a simple common goal, so that the entire nation establishes the same patriotic morality for themselves and firmly establishes the same nation-building faith for the nation. Every member of the nation can strive and sacrifice for the same faith based on the same moral concept. What is stated here may seem very commonplace, but the revival of the Chinese nation must come from this path. If we can truly implement the National Spiritual Mobilization with the unity of the entire country, then any difficulties can be borne, any obstacles can be overcome, and the final victory is inevitable. Conversely, if the people cannot understand and practice this, or if their understanding is not genuine and their practice is not consistent, then the national crisis will intensify, and defeating the enemy will become more difficult. Therefore, the future of the War of Resistance and the success or failure, safety, or danger of the nation's destiny all depend on the one act of the National Spiritual Mobilization. Here, we elaborate on the essential meaning and discuss it in sections, hoping that our people will unanimously accept and practice it.

(2) Common Goals: The National Spiritual Mobilization has three simple and obvious common goals that are easy for everyone to understand and implement. They should be highlighted first, namely: (1) The nation is supreme, the race is supreme; (2) Military affairs are first, victory is first; and (3) Concentrate willpower, concentrate strength.

The Nation is Supreme, the Race is Supreme

The nation is supreme, the race is supreme. All our people today, whether wise or foolish, should have deeply felt that under the circumstances where the survival of the nation is under severe threat, no individual or their career can be guaranteed safety. The enemy's desire to eliminate our national consciousness and break up our national unity will first be piecemeal and divided, and then humiliated and annihilated. Their ambition and insidious plan have become increasingly clear. Therefore, consolidating the survival of the nation should take precedence over everything else. However, the highest system of national life is the state. Without a state, national life cannot be maintained and developed. A nation that has lost its country, like the Jews, is subject to being slaughtered by others. How tragic! Therefore, consolidating the country should undoubtedly take precedence over everything else. Therefore, we must recognize today that the nation is supreme, the race is supreme, and the interests of the nation and the race should be above all else. In front of the nation and the race, we should sacrifice all personal opinions, selfishness, private interests, and even the freedom and lives of our entire family without regret.

Military Affairs First, Victory First

(2) Military Affairs First, Victory First: During this military period of resolving the survival of the nation, the greatest interest of the nation is military interest. Therefore, all thoughts and actions of the people should be absolutely subject to the control of the national and racial military interests. In order to achieve military interests and to increase military interests, the nation may demand all sacrifices from the people, and the people themselves must actively and enthusiastically contribute everything they have. Therefore, it is said that military affairs are first. The only purpose of military affairs is to seek victory. Therefore, the people must establish the belief that they will win and achieve the goal of final victory, exhausting all their knowledge, abilities, time, and energy to seek military victory. During this period, there should be no so-called personal gains, losses, interests, or personal humiliations and honors. Only achieving military victory is the glory shared by all our people, and only failing to achieve victory is everyone's greatest shame. All merits and demerits, all right and wrong, should be based on this as the standard. Therefore, it is also said that victory is first.

Concentrate Willpower, Concentrate Strength

(2) Concentrate Willpower, Concentrate Strength: Now that our country is in a time of national emergency for self-defense, all citizens should concentrate all their willpower and concentrate all their strength. All citizens with reason and conscience should have no time for other thoughts or actions at this time other than to do their best to safeguard the country and seek victory. From the perspective of the nation, it is also necessary to require the absolute unity and concentration of the thoughts of the entire people on the two meanings of the nation being supreme, the race being supreme, military affairs being first, and victory being first. There is no room for disagreement or doubt, and no room for other empty thoughts or theories. Furthermore, it is necessary to mobilize all citizens in all occupations and all departments to work together with one heart and one mind, to strive for the military interests of the nation in the midst of hardship, each doing their best and each fulfilling their duties, to improve everything, create everything, to implement long-term military plans, and at the same time achieve the completion of our nation-building work. Therefore, it is said that willpower should be concentrated and strength should be concentrated. The above three meanings are simple and clear, and the matters are very easy to implement. The people must be happy to accept this and must accept it unanimously. Please further discuss the same morality that we want to establish and determine the content of the same faith.

The Morality of Saving the Nation Lies in Loyalty and Filial Piety

(3) The Morality of Saving the Nation: China needs to revitalize itself, resist foreign invaders, and save the country. Therefore, the same morality that our entire nation needs to strive to practice today is the morality of saving the nation, which is also the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace advocated by Sun Yat-sen. The people may have shallow or deep understanding of these eight virtues, but the continuous greatness of the Chinese nation has been inherited from this morality. The current decline is due to the loss of this morality. Therefore, it is necessary to require our people to unanimously establish this morality of saving the nation. Among the eight virtues, the most fundamental are loyalty and filial piety. Only loyalty and filial piety are the great foundation for the establishment of the Chinese nation. For five thousand years, the ancestors have left this precious legacy to future generations. Now, in a time of national crisis, all compatriots must be loyal and filial, do their utmost loyalty to the country, and practice their great filial piety to the nation.

Practice Great Filial Piety Towards the Nation

Please first talk about filial piety. For thousands of years, the so-called filial piety in Chinese society has not only been about fulfilling filial piety to one's parents, but also about fulfilling filial piety to one's ancestors. Therefore, having no descendants to continue the ancestral sacrifices is the greatest form of unfilial piety. When Sun Yat-sen talked about nationalism, he promoted and expanded the inherent filial piety of China and extended it to the relationship between fellow countrymen and fellow tribesmen. Therefore, the object of our filial piety today should be the entire nation. We should strive not to let down the common ancestors of our nation. We should always remember the beautiful rivers and mountains that our hundreds of generations of common ancestors worked so hard to create and leave to us. If we lose them in our hands, how can we face our ancestors above and our common descendants below? Other crimes can be redeemed, but unfilial piety cannot be redeemed. If our compatriots understand this meaning, then sacrificing oneself to maintain the survival of the nation must be regarded as the highest responsibility of everyone.

Do Utmost Loyalty to the Country

The so-called loyalty must first be loyalty to the country. Loyalty to the country is actually the way to preserve the survival and development of the nation. In today's China, everyone must take the protection of national independence as a sacred responsibility. Only then can the country be saved. The state has its absoluteness. If you want to maintain the freedom and independence of the country, the prerequisite is the absolute unity of military and political orders. Now that the brutal enemy is using great force to destroy our country and is creating pseudo-organizations in various occupied areas in an attempt to divide our country, all our people must be loyal to the country to strengthen the country's self-defense forces, be loyal to their duties, be loyal to discipline, and be loyal to the law. Never allow the slightest idea of disunity or violate the law to reduce the authority of the state. If the Chinese people can truly do their filial piety to the nation and their loyalty to the country, then the mission of resisting foreign aggression and saving the country will have people who can truly bear it. As for virtues such as benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, they all evolved from the two meanings of loyalty and filial piety. Benevolence and love are an extension of filial piety, and faith and righteousness are an extension of loyalty. Benevolence and love will prevent mutual killing. If we can promote benevolence and love today, we will not sit idly by while our compatriots are insulted and killed, and we will have the courage to share the enemy's hatred. If we promote faith and righteousness, we will be able to be responsible and fulfill our duties, be honest and sincere, and create unity to face difficulties together. If we promote our inherent ideal of loving peace for thousands of years, we will be happy to fight against violence and seek permanent peace, and we must take the lead in striving bravely and relentlessly. When all these virtues of saving the nation are brought into play, they are no different from strong armor and sharp weapons. In short, this is the spiritual weapon of the nation, and everyone should use it to arm themselves to drive out the brutal enemy and create a new and glorious history for our country.

The Nation-Building Principles are the Three Principles of the People

(4) The Nation-Building Faith: What is the ultimate goal of our demanding that our people move in the same direction, establish the same morality, and strive hard without fear of hardship? It is to complete the construction of a country based on the Three Principles of the People. As mentioned earlier, the significance of this War of Resistance is not only to resist the enemy, but also to establish the foundation of nation-building. Therefore, even in wartime, we must never forget nation-building. Only by having a consistent and established nation-building policy and promoting it with all our strength can we fully unleash the power to resist aggression and seek victory. Only when the entire nation can establish the faith of nation-building can the spiritual strength and morality of saving the nation have a solid foundation for active development. Therefore, saving the nation and building the nation are inherently consistent in meaning and the same in purpose. The highest principle of China's nation-building is the Three Principles of the People created by Sun Yat-sen. This is recognized by all compatriots in the country. Today, the fate of the nation is at stake. If the War of Resistance is won, then nation-building will be achieved, and the nation will be able to enjoy permanent happiness and benefit. Therefore, our people must have a common faith and common struggle in the Three Principles of the People under our nation-building principles and seek its realization. The purpose of the Three Principles of the People is to seek equality in international status, equality in political status, and equality in economic status. We should seek the independence, freedom, and equality of the country for the people to have, by the people to govern, and for the people to enjoy. This is the common desire of everyone, and the Three Principles of the People is the only way to achieve this national construction. Now, in wartime, people's hearts are uplifted, and the trend is even more consistent. Saving the nation and building the nation should be advanced side by side. In terms of nationalism, resisting foreign aggression to seek the independence, freedom, and equality of the nation is the only purpose of the War of Resistance today. The joint efforts of all ethnic groups in the country to shoulder the burden of resisting aggression and reviving the nation can further enhance the unity of the entire nation and lay a solid foundation for the vast Republic of China. In terms of the Principle of Democracy, the wartime popularization of national political knowledge is sufficient to accelerate the cultivation of genuine democracy. The concentration and adjustment of the wartime government's powers are sufficient to create a highly efficient government. In terms of the Principle of Livelihood, the wartime efforts to increase production and control consumption are to establish people's livelihood. As a result of the state's implementation of wartime economic policies based on the Principle of Livelihood, both public and private industries will have balanced and rational development after the war, and the majority of the people will use wartime life, wartime actions, and wartime spirit to strive for production, strive for creation, and thus gain progress and prosperity. Following this path, the establishment of a new country based on the Three Principles of the People will be achieved when the War of Resistance wins a glorious victory, and the foundation of China's eternal peace and happiness will be laid. The future is bright and clearly in sight. This is what our people should strive for with one heart, excitement, and common effort, and the way to do so begins with our people's consistent and firm establishment of the same nation-building faith.

### Japanese Merchants in North China Still Believe in Legal Tender

Peiping: After the new regulations on the circulation of "Federal Reserve" banknotes in North China were implemented yesterday, some panic arose here. However, today, according to reliable claims, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai are included in the "United Zone," and this panic has been eliminated. Anyone found carrying legal tender in these cities and other cities in the "United Zone" will be fined and their legal tender confiscated. In addition to the above four cities, the "United Zone" also contains seven cities in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan: Jinan, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Shanhaiguan, Linqing, and Xinxiang. The remaining areas of North China are considered "bandit areas," and legal tender will continue to circulate, but it must be exchanged for "Federal Reserve" banknotes at a discount set by the government. It is also learned that the Japanese Chambers of Commerce in North China sent a telegram to Tokyo on Thursday, urging the Japanese government to postpone the implementation of the new currency plan for at least four months. This application seems to be invalid. Although this statement has not been officially confirmed, it comes from reliable sources. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)

### The Soviet Union's Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged: Willing to Provide Assistance to Invaded Countries. The Concessions of Democratic Countries Fuel the Arrogance of Aggressors. The Whole Country is Sincerely United and Guards the Territory with Readiness.

(Moscow) The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opened at 5:00 PM today in the Kremlin. About 2,000 representatives participated. Party and government leaders such as Stalin, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov, Deputy Chairman Mikoyan, People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union Kalinin, People's Commissar of Heavy Industry Kaganovich, and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Zhdanov all attended. Molotov delivered the opening speech. (Tenth Havas Telegram)

(Moscow) The 18th Communist Party Congress held its opening ceremony in the Kremlin today. Stalin delivered a lengthy speech discussing the aggression of Germany, Italy, and Japan, stating briefly: "This kind of imperialist war is launched by various aggressor countries, infringing on the interests of various non-aggressor countries such as Britain, the United States, and France in various ways. The step-by-step retreat and repeated concessions to the aggressors by various democratic countries, so that the world and the sphere of influence are openly re-divided, is now clearly presented to us. Various non-aggressive countries sacrifice their interests without any intention of resisting, and even tacitly approve of it. Although this is difficult to believe, it is a fact. The policy of non-intervention is tantamount to tacitly approving aggression. Plans for peace and disarmament have become relics of the past. Various propaganda speeches about the Munich Agreement have begun a new era of appeasement, and no one believes them anymore. Even the countries that signed the agreement do not trust such rhetoric. The Soviet Union cannot ignore such ominous events and has made great efforts to enhance the war preparations of the navy and army." (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)

Stalin's Report

(Moscow) At the first meeting of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union yesterday, General Secretary Stalin presented a report on the work of the Central Committee. The foreign policy section did not show any significant changes, and it seems unlikely that there will be any major changes as rumored by certain foreigners. Stalin said, "We love peace and are willing to promote commercial relations with all countries, as long as those countries maintain the same relationship with us and do not harm our national interests, we can live in peace. Countries that border our country should also maintain good-neighborly relations with us, provided that those countries do not directly or indirectly attempt to harm our country's territorial integrity and the inviolability of our borders. The Soviet Union is willing to provide assistance to nations that are invaded and struggling for national independence and is not afraid of the threats of aggressor countries. If warlike countries violate our country's territorial integrity and attack our country, they will be retaliated against doubly."

Our country has made great progress in economics, politics, and culture, and has become united in spirit and politics. Our navy and army are becoming increasingly strong, and we are pursuing a policy of peace. The workers of all countries are also providing us with spiritual sympathy, and all countries also have the common sense of understanding, not seeking illegitimate interests by destroying peace. All of these serve as the backing for our country's foreign policy. At this time, the Second World War instigated by imperialism has already been launched, with the aim of re-dividing the world. Although Germany, Italy, and Japan use various excuses to conceal their true intentions, their struggle with Britain, France, and the United States is a real situation.

At this point, Stalin also imitated the tone of the authorities of Germany, Italy, and Japan and said, "If it is said that we are fighting against the interests held by Britain, France, and the United States, it is a ridiculous fallacy. We are fighting against the Communist International, not against Britain, France, and the United States. Those who doubt my words should review the public documents of the Anti-Comintern Pact." (The representatives in the field laughed when they heard this) It should be known that war is an open fact and cannot be concealed from the eyes and ears of the world by any sophistry. Japan has already seized vast lands in China, Italy has already seized Abyssinia, and Germany has already seized Austria and the Sudetenland. Germany and Italy have also joined forces to seize Spain. All of these facts are clear and obvious. How can the Axis, the Triple Alliance, etc. conceal them? War is war, and an aggressive group is an aggressive group, that's all."

Among the bourgeois countries, there is a distinction between aggressor countries and non-aggressor countries. The non-stop concessions of non-aggressor countries are due to fewer fears of revolutionaries (revolution must have a world nature in wartime). The main reason is that the non-aggressor countries, including Britain and France, have abandoned the principle of collective security and do not adopt a policy of collective resistance to aggression. As long as the fire is not burning their eyebrows, they maintain a neutral attitude. "It seems that the Western European countries consider it a good idea to sweep the snow in front of their own doors, but in fact, they are very wrong. Not only that, but Britain and France also plan to shift Germany's line of sight, causing it to change its development towards the Soviet Union's Ukrainian Republic. This kind of strategy will lead to irreparable defeat, and it should be dealt with with extreme caution." Some politicians and reporters in European countries and the United States are impatient to wait for Germany to expand its power to the Ukrainian Republic, and they have even revealed the inside story and openly stated that Germany's halt to its advance towards the Soviet Union and its turn to Western European countries to demand colonies is disappointing. The policy of non-intervention that it has promoted has been fully revealed." In fact, those who want the Ukrainian Republic to secede from the Soviet Union can be said to be very unthinking. It is difficult to promote the separation of 700,000 residents of the Carpathian Ukrainian province in Czechoslovakia, let alone the 30 million residents of the Soviet Union's Ukrainian Republic. In short, the policy of the Soviet Union focuses on maintaining peace and maintaining good-neighborly relations with all countries, but all countries must also adopt the same attitude to get along with each other. This is the way to long-term peace and stability. The Soviet Union's military strength has been strengthened, and it can deal with those who come to provoke it calmly. (Eleventh Havas)

### Five-Year Plan Achievement Report: Significant Progress in Industrial and Agricultural Production

### Stalin: Full Report

(Moscow) The full text of Stalin's report is as follows:

"Since the 17th Congress, five years have passed. As you all know, these five years have been by no means insignificant. The world has undergone major changes, and the relations between countries have changed greatly in many respects. But what are the changes in the international situation and the international and domestic position of our country during this period? For capitalist countries, this period has been one of extremely serious changes in both economic and political terms.

Economically, this period began with a period of depression, and from the second half of 1937, it became a period of new economic panic, a period of renewed decline in the industry of the United States, Britain, and France, and consequently a period of new economic turmoil. Politically, this period was one of serious political conflicts and changes. A new imperialist war has been going on for two years, taking place in a vast area from Shanghai to the Strait of Gibraltar, involving a population of over 500 million. The map of Asia, Europe and Africa is being redrawn by force. The entire system after the war, the so-called peaceful order, has been shaken from its roots. For the Soviet Union, the opposite is true. This is a period of growth and prosperity, a period of further economic and cultural progress, a period of further growth of political and economic power, and a period of striving to safeguard world peace. This is the general situation. Below, we will continue to examine the specific facts of the changes in the international situation. "The economic panic that began in capitalist countries in the second half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1933. After that, the panic turned into a depression, followed by a certain recovery, and a certain amount of industrial progress began. However, this economic recovery did not develop into the prosperity of a normal recovery period. On the contrary, from the second half of 1937, a new economic panic began to strangle the United States first, and then spread to Britain, France, and other countries. In this way, capitalist countries were hit by a new economic panic before they had recovered from the previous economic panic. This situation naturally made unemployment even more serious. The number of unemployed in capitalist countries had already decreased from 30 million in 1933 to 14 million in 1937, but now it has increased again to 18 million due to the new economic panic. The characteristics of this new panic, although different from the last panic in many respects, are worse rather than better in all these respects. "First, the new economic panic did not begin after a period of industrial prosperity, as in 1929, but began after a period of depression and a certain recovery that failed to develop to the level of prosperity. This means that the current panic will be more serious and more difficult to resist than the last panic. Secondly, the current panic did not occur in peacetime, but at a time when the Second Imperialist War had already begun, that is, Japan, which had been fighting in China for the second year, was disrupting China's huge market, making it almost impossible for other countries to import goods, Germany and Italy had already put their national economies on a wartime economic basis, and had thus exhausted their raw materials and currency resources, and all other major capitalist powers were just beginning to transform their economies on a wartime basis. This means that capitalism will lack more resources to escape the new panic in a normal way than it did during the last panic. Finally, this panic is different from the last in that it is not universal, but for the time being only extends to countries with strong economic power that have not yet implemented a wartime economic system. As for the aggressor countries such as Japan, Germany, and Italy, they have reorganized their economic systems on a wartime basis, and therefore, due to the extreme development of the war industry, they have not yet reached the stage of panic of overproduction, although they are approaching that stage. This means that when the non-aggressor countries with strong economic power begin to emerge from the panic period in the future, the aggressor countries, after exhausting their gold and raw material reserves in the heat of the war, will enter a period of extremely severe panic." "If we take a look at the visible gold reserves of various capitalist countries, we can understand this point. At the end of 1936, the visible gold reserves of all capitalist countries, in millions of old gold dollars, totaled 12,980, of which the United States accounted for 6,649, the United Kingdom 2,029, France 1,769, the Netherlands 289, Belgium 373, Switzerland 387, Germany 16, Italy 123, and Japan 273. By September 1938, the total was 14,301, of which the United States accounted for 8,126, the United Kingdom 2,396, France 1,435, the Netherlands 595, Belgium 307, Germany 17, Italy 124, and Japan 97. The unit of the numbers is millions of gold dollars.

The following figures are sufficient to show the dynamics of the industrial panic in capitalist countries and the progress of Soviet industry over the past five years.

Assuming that industrial production in 1929 is 100%, then industrial production in the United States in 1934 was 66.4%, in 1935 it was 75.6%, in 1936 it was 88.1%, in 1937 it was 92.2%, and in 1938 it was 72%. In the United Kingdom, in 1934 it was 98.8%, in 1935 it was 105.8%, in 1936 it was 115.9%, in 1937 it was 123.7%, and in 1938 it was 112%. The percentages for France by year were 71 in 1934, 67.4 in 1935, 79.3 in 1936, 82.8 in 1937, and 70 in 1938. In Italy, it was 80 in 1934, 93.8 in 1935, 87.5 in 1936, 99.6 in 1937, and 96 in 1938. In Germany, it was 79.8 in 1934, 94 in 1935, 106.3 in 1936, 117.2 in 1937, and 125 in 1938. In Japan, it was 128.7 in 1934, 141.8 in 1935, 151.1 in 1936, 170.8 in 1937, and 165 in 1938. In the Soviet Union, it was 238.3 in 1934, 293.4 in 1935, 382.3 in 1936, 42.4 in 1937, and 477 in 1938. (To be continued)

### Great Powers' Economic Aid to China: Japan Greatly Alarmed; Plans to Strengthen Economic Ties with Germany and Italy; Eastern Newspaper Urges Retaliation Against Britain and the United States

(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita, in response to a question in the Lower House yesterday regarding Britain's loan to China, declared that the result of this step by Britain would inevitably strengthen Chiang Kai-shek. Arita continued that the Japanese government is now considering lodging a protest with London. Regarding the same issue, Prime Minister Hiranuma also made a detailed statement, saying that Japan will do its best to overcome all difficulties in its Far Eastern policy. (Reuters, 11th)

(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita, in response to questioning in the Diet yesterday, strongly stated Japan's hope to strengthen economic relations between Japan, Germany, and Italy. It is said that if an economic agreement is beneficial to Japan, the Japanese government will consider concluding an economic agreement with any country in the world, and strengthening the economic alliance between Japan and Germany or Japan and Italy is particularly important. Japan and Germany have already begun negotiations on economic issues between the two countries, but a detailed investigation has not yet been conducted. The Hochi Shimbun today published an editorial, discussing commercial treaties, recalling that commercial treaties have already been concluded between Japan and Italy, and that German and Japanese representatives have been negotiating in Berlin to conclude a commercial treaty since 1937. If a new commercial treaty between Japan and Germany is concluded, the commercial ties between Japan, Germany, and Italy can become closer. (Reuters, 11th)

(Tokyo) During yesterday's Diet debate on taxation, it was revealed that Japan's monetary policy in Central and South China is. A spokesperson for the Asia Development Board, in response to a question, said that in view of "the current status of the National Government's currency," it is not easy to include Central and South China in the Japanese yen bloc. However, the government is currently considering this matter in order to gradually place Central and South China in the Japanese yen bloc. Finance Minister Ishiwata acknowledged that there is some "necessity" to keep Central and South China outside the Japanese yen bloc because Japan needs to trade with various parts of China that can supply Japan with foreign currency. However, he also emphasized that these areas must not be absolutely outside the Japanese yen bloc, such as the large circulation of Japanese currency and Japanese yen in Central and South China, and military needs. (Reuters, 11th)

(Tokyo) After Britain decided to continue providing financial loans to China to stabilize China's currency system, the general elements in Japan who have always advocated reconciliation with Britain and the United States were greatly disappointed. The "Financial Institutions Newspaper" published an article today, believing that London and Chongqing have united to oppose Japan's financial plans in North China. The newspaper demanded that the Japanese government not only take "countermeasures," but also lodge a protest with London. Tokyo political figures pointed out that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita had just given a speech a few days ago, calling on democratic countries to understand "the work of constructing the new Far East." After the announcement of this declaration, Japanese people were hoping that Britain could adopt a more reserved attitude towards the Chinese government, but unexpectedly the British government responded with loans.

### British Supporters of China Hold Meeting; Advocate Democratic Nations Cooperate to Impose Economic Sanctions on Japan

(London) A meeting on the China incident was held here today, discussing the war in China from the perspectives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Chairman Sinclair, leader of the Liberal Party, declared that dictatorial countries have a common interest in exploiting China's weakness to aid Japan, another dictatorial country. At the same time, the Soviet Union, the United States, and democratic countries in Western Europe also have a common interest in safeguarding the principles and laws of the Nine-Power Treaty, and in caring for China's culture and prosperity and protecting it from the scourge of war and violence. Labor MP Noel-Baker spoke, urging the implementation of economic sanctions against Japan, and saying that he hoped the British government would cooperate with the United States and France to ban the import of Japanese goods. If this were done, the tragedy of thousands of small white boxes containing the ashes of Japanese soldiers being transported back from China every day could be ended. Former French Resident-General in Annam, Pasquier, declared that as far as Japan is concerned, its "first enemy" is neither China nor the Soviet Union, but Britain, and its "second enemy" is the United States. Rothstein said that the Soviet Union does not deny that it will continue to provide China with military materials and moral support. (Reuters, 11th)

(London) At the opening ceremony of the National Aid China Conference in London tonight, the Archbishop of York delivered a speech, mentioning the Chinese people's loyal and courageous resistance, saying, "Organized powers have failed to end the suffering of the Chinese people, which I am ashamed of." Chairwoman Frey stated that Britain has not fully understood the serious impact of the Far East incident on the lives of the British people. If Japan succeeds in the Far East, one-fifth of mankind will be driven into the industrial world in the position of semi-enslaved people. (Reuters, 10th)

### British Far East Shipping Threatened by Japan; Shipping Committee Makes Recommendations, Asks Government to Seriously Consider

(London) The report of the Imperial Shipping Committee has made far-reaching recommendations on the threat to British shipping in the Far East, especially from Japan. It is said that subsidies, currency devaluation, and lower living standards are all factors that make Japanese ships' expenses much lower than those of British ships. It is now urgent to strengthen the shipping industry and allow it to operate between Australia and Japan and between India and Japan. These ships will be of great help in maintaining the commerce of Australia and India in the event of war. The British government must give this issue serious consideration. British ships should cooperate more closely to form a united front. All relevant governments may also need to consider providing some financial assistance to these ships' operating expenses. Japanese Eastern shipping through the Panama Canal has increased to account for two-fifths of the total, while British shipping has fallen from one-third of the total to one-fifth, and American shipping has also fallen from one-third to one-eighth. The reason for the gradual increase in Japanese merchant ships is that Japan's trade with various countries is becoming more and more prosperous, and because the Japanese government has taken special plans to assist the shipping industry, regarding it as a way to promote new trade. In 1936, the expenses of Japanese ships were 10 to 15 percent lower than those of British ships. British ships now urgently need to improve their equipment in order to compete effectively with foreign passenger ships, and management should also be greatly changed. Eastern representatives should increase their powers. The report also stated that all the matters involved are related to naval and economic defense in both peacetime and wartime. The importance of the Eastern market to merchant ships is like the importance of Singapore to naval air squadrons. The development and prosperity of the British commercial banks in the Far East depend on the ability of British merchant ships to engage in trade in the Far East. (Reuters, 11th)

### Earthquake in Japan

(Tokyo) At 3:12 AM today, a strong earthquake was felt in western Japan. Wall clocks all stopped. The epicenter was located 150 miles northeast of Tokyo, but no major damage has been reported in any part of Japan so far. (Associated Press, 11th)

At the same time, according to unconfirmed reports, a portion of General Miaja's troops has defected from the National Defense Council and surrendered to the Communists. Street fighting in Madrid was still extremely fierce at midnight yesterday. (Reuters, 11th)

### Slovak Separatist Movement: Serious Situation in Czechoslovakia; Czech President Uses Harsh Tactics to Reorganize Slovak Provincial Government

Prague: After adopting harsh measures to quell the separatist conspiracy within the Slovak community, the Czech government has now taken control of the overall situation in the autonomous province of Slovakia tonight. Ševčík, the former representative sent to Rome to attend the coronation of the new Pope, has been recalled to serve as the Prime Minister of Slovakia in place of Tiso. It is reported that Tiso opposed the dismissal and has appealed to German leader Hitler. After the Hlinka Guard was disbanded, some of its members have been detained, and the rest have been sent to Moravia. Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, is now calm after a brief disturbance this morning. Its railway stations are guarded by military police. Newspapers have been temporarily suspended, and military authorities have banned the public from listening to foreign radio broadcasts. The conflict between Slovakia and the Czech Republic has lasted for a long time, and it is difficult to predict when it can be resolved. (Reuters, 10th)

Prague: President Hácha's order to reorganize the autonomous government of the Slovak province seemed to be a sudden move, but in reality, the central government had been making arrangements in secret. When Tiso, the Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior of the autonomous government, under the instigation of Sano Mach, the former director of the Propaganda Department, was preparing to declare the province an independent and free state, he resolutely used this "coup" method to strike first. Initially, the central government felt that the attitude of the autonomous government of the province was ambiguous and had submitted a written request to it, demanding a solemn declaration of willingness to unite spiritually with the Czech community. Unexpectedly, the autonomous government refused to comply and took the opportunity to put forward various ambiguous demands in order to delay the matter. The central government, knowing that the situation was critical, decided to impose strict restrictions. (Havas, 10th)

(London) A diplomatic observer here stated that the Slovak rebellion against the Czech federal government failed yesterday, and we can see from this that countries with a complex mix of nationalities have not been stable since being divided by Munich. The undercurrent of this rebellion is quite elusive to European politicians, because experts generally do not believe that this rebellion is purely a spontaneous movement. It is undeniable that the Slovak community does not approve of the federal government, and it is also undeniable that Germany, Poland, Italy, and Hungary are all genuinely concerned about the division and disintegration of the existing elements of the Czech organization. However, although Germany has condemned Czech President Hácha's harsh tactics of eliminating the Slovak rebel party, we cannot arbitrarily conclude that Germany must be the backer of the rebel party. It is now noteworthy that Tiso, the former Slovak Prime Minister who was dismissed by the Czech government, has appealed to the German government for assistance in the Slovak independence movement. How will Germany respond? This is what the world wants to know. Recently, the Czech Republic has not been as obedient to Berlin as it was before, but what can Germany hope to gain from Slovakia's secession from the Czech Republic? This is difficult to predict at present. It is possible that the resolution of the Slovak movement is somewhat related to the unresolved fate of Ruthenia, which Hungary and Poland are willing to divide between themselves under Italian protection. (Reuters, 10th)

### Slovak Parliament Submits New Cabinet List: Czech Cabinet Expected to Accept

Prague: Official circles here now hold a kind of hope that a compromise can be reached according to the constitution to resolve the turmoil within the Czech Republic caused by the changes of the radical elements in Slovakia. The radical faction in Slovakia aims to declare Slovakia an independent country and break away from the Czech Republic. The Czech government today adopted a moderate plan, agreeing to establish a new Slovak government that truly represents the Slovak community, acting according to the procedures of the late Slovak Autonomy Party leader Hlinka. This promise has been broadcast by Czech Deputy Prime Minister Sidor. Sidor claimed that the list of new members of the Slovak cabinet has been submitted to the Czech President by the executive committee of the Slovak Parliament, together with former Prime Minister Tiso. The Czech cabinet is scheduled to meet this morning to discuss the new members of the Slovak cabinet, and it is expected that this list will definitely be accepted by the Czech cabinet. (Reuters, 11th)

Leipzig: Although the general mood here is extremely tense, the situation may turn sharply downward and a compromise is possible. It is said that Tiso, the dismissed Slovak Prime Minister, is still personally participating in the talks to form a new cabinet. It was reported this morning that an agreement has been reached in these talks, but the list has not yet been released as of 10:00 AM. (Reuters, 11th)

### Former Slovak Prime Minister Begs Germany for Assistance: Delivers a Note

(Berlin) According to semi-official news, the Slovak government led by former Prime Minister Tiso has sent a note to Germany. At the same time, Slovak cabinet member Ďurčanský (also dismissed by the Czech President) and German minority leader Karmasin have arrived in Vienna, carrying a special mission from Tiso to visit Hitler in Berlin. Before his departure, Ďurčanský issued a radio broadcast, denouncing the current members of the Slovak government as traitors to Slovakia, and saying that from a constitutional standpoint, the Czech Republic has no reason to interfere in Slovak affairs. (Reuters, 10th)

(Berlin) After the Czech central government suddenly reorganized the autonomous government of the Slovak province, all the majority of cabinet members who sympathized with former Prime Minister Tiso, such as cabinet member without portfolio Karmasin and Labor Minister Ďurčanský, have fled into German territory and requested assistance from the German government. Well-informed sources here recently declared that Germany is very concerned about the Czech central government's attitude. According to the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration, the Czech Republic promised to make various concessions to the various minority groups. In other words, the Czech Republic not only granted the right to national self-determination to the German people, but also promised to grant the same right to the Slovak, Ukrainian, and Hungarian minority groups. However, in terms of this action, it seems that it wants to go back on its word. According to the local newspaper, the autonomous government of the Slovak province has sent a note to the German government, the contents of which are not known. (Havas, 10th)

### Central Government Measures Purely Internal, Absolutely No Impact on National Policy; Peace Maintained in Various Regions

Prague: Well-informed sources recently stated that after the central government took strict military measures within the province of Slovakia, the situation throughout the province was quite peaceful. The Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Mr. Sokol, arrived here this morning and immediately met with President Hacha and Prime Minister Beran of the central government cabinet for talks. The cabinet advisor and Minister of Slovak Affairs was also present. Afterwards, Sokol immediately returned to the capital of Slovakia to explain the central government's intentions to key political figures, and it is uncertain whether he will return here. The ambassadors of Germany, Italy, and Poland all visited Foreign Minister Chvalkovský in the afternoon to inquire about the current situation. The Foreign Minister immediately informed them that the measures taken by the central government were purely internal and would not affect national policy. The general public here is paying close attention to the attitudes of various countries. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Prague: This morning, it was learned here that the Czech central government held a cabinet meeting last night to discuss the Slovakian situation. It is unknown whether a course of action has been decided. News from Bratislava this morning stated that, apart from clashes between the Hlinka Guard and Czech troops, the situation was peaceful last night. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)

Capital of Slovakia Province: After the central government ordered the dissolution of the provincial autonomous government, several demonstrations immediately broke out here. However, the central government had taken military measures in advance to prevent this, so order was maintained. Extremist members of the Autonomy Party occupied the party headquarters and exchanged gunfire with Czech military police, injuring several people on both sides. Demonstrators also attempted to march in formation but were dispersed by the military. Another group of over three thousand demonstrators held a rally in the central square of the city, where German propagandist Fuhsnehdort delivered a speech, vehemently criticizing the Czech people. By 9:00 p.m., all cafes and public places were ordered by the police authorities to close. The "People's Daily" stated that the leaders of the extremist faction of the Autonomy Party, Sano Mach and Bela Tuka, originally planned to launch a rebellion on the 6th of this month, first declaring independence and then merging with Hungary. However, due to a lack of support, they abandoned the plan. The autonomous status of Slovakia province is still expected to be recognized by the central government. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Bratislava, Slovakia Province: Order has been completely restored here. The new autonomous government of Slovakia Province appointed by the central government has not yet taken office. It is said that the Slovak people insist that the former Prime Minister, Tiso, must continue to be part of the cabinet. (Note: Tiso has been taken by the central military authorities to a monastery in the suburbs and placed under house arrest.) It is reported that the speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Sokol, has gone to Prague today to hold talks with the central authorities. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Hitler Holds Midnight Meeting to Discuss Czech Crisis; May Intervene Forcefully Regardless of How to Resolve Political Turmoil

(Berlin) It is heard that Hitler has convened his closest advisors for a midnight meeting at the Chancellery tonight to discuss the recent Czech "crisis." (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(Berlin) Regarding the Czech central government's reorganization of the autonomous government of Slovakia Province, after receiving an important report from the German Embassy in the Czech Republic yesterday, Chancellor Hitler immediately summoned Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in the afternoon and convened several private advisors this morning to discuss the matter. Commentators believe that the German government may intervene forcefully and is unwilling to recognize the new provincial government appointed by the Czech central government. In short, the Czech political turmoil must be resolved quickly, regardless of the method used. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

(Berlin) Regarding the conflict between the Czech and Slovak peoples, German officials have expressed sympathy for the Slovak people, saying that they "are fighting for independence." Well-informed sources say that the declaration made by former Slovak Prime Minister Tiso was issued on behalf of the German semi-official news agency, the German News Agency." The German government's support for the Slovak people is evident. Germany and Italy have not yet provided guarantees for the Czech border. Now that political turmoil has occurred in the Czech Republic, there may be an exchange of views. The "People's Observation Report" stated that "the Czech government authorities are using terrorist tactics against the Slovak people." The "German General Report" characterized Czech President Hacha's reorganization of the Slovak Autonomous Provincial Government as a "violation of the constitution." (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Concern in Britain and France

(Paris) After the Czech central government ordered the reorganization of the Slovak autonomous provincial government, the British side is concerned about the situation in the province. They are worried that the momentum of Germany's "eastward expansion" policy has not diminished. They say that Germany has at least facilitated Slovakia's resistance to the central government, such as encouraging separatist movements in the province. The fact that two Slovak provincial government ministers visited Berlin, and that the German Vienna radio station broadcasts anti-Czech programs in Slovak are all sufficient to prove that Germany has certain influence in Slovakia province. It is commendable that the Czech central government was able to deal with it resolutely this time. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

London: Diplomatic circles here are closely monitoring the situation in the Czech Republic and believe that the Czech central government, in light of the separatist movements advocated by the Slovak and Ukrainian minority groups, is doing everything possible to maintain unity and has no other motives. The origins of this incident seem to lie in the visit of Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu to Poland. During his talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, Foreign Minister Gafencu no longer expressed opposition to the connection of Polish and Hungarian territories. Upon hearing the news, the Slovak separatists were greatly excited. This separatist movement, which would facilitate the realization of Polish-Hungarian understanding, is naturally supported by Hungary, but the German government does not want to see it materialize. As of now, although German newspapers have supported the Slovak people and criticized the Czech central government, their true intentions remain questionable. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### Attitudes of Poland and Hungary

Warsaw: People here are paying close attention to the Slovak cabinet dissolution incident. Political figures say that the Czech central government's handling of this matter was not entirely appropriate and that further disturbances may arise. Poland may be directly affected, as Poland has ethnic ties with Slovakia, and there are no disagreements between them. This opinion expresses the Polish people's sympathy for Slovak demands. (Haitong dispatch, 11th)

Warsaw: Newspapers here mostly say that the seriousness of this Czech incident is comparable to the Czech-German conflict of last September. Well-informed sources say that the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration Award (the arbitration award on the demarcation between the Czech and Hungarian territories) have not completely resolved the Czech crisis. There are still many difficulties among the Czech, Slovak, and Ukrainian peoples in the country. Political instability in the Czech Republic is directly related to Polish interests and cannot be ignored. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Budapest: Regarding the new Czech incident, newspapers in Budapest are publishing it under the headline "The Czech Republic is About to Collapse." This undoubtedly expresses the general hope of the Hungarian people. At the same time, political figures do not shy away from Hungary's welcome for the establishment of an independent Slovak state. (Haitong dispatch, 11th)

### United States Expands Navy to Maintain Superiority Over Japan; 75 Warships Under Construction; British Naval Budget Also Formulated

(Washington) U.S. Naval Chief of Staff Leahy today criticized Japanese newspapers for reporting that Japan is determined to build a powerful navy equal to any country in the world. He stated that the United States is determined to maintain a five-to-three advantage over Japan. Although this ratio has been slightly imbalanced due to Japan's recent shipbuilding plans, the United States currently has 75 warships under construction, so it will soon be able to restore the five-to-three advantage. In addition, the $38,524,000 naval public works project in the $200 million U.S. rearmament plan has been unanimously approved by the House Naval Affairs Committee. According to this plan, the engineering fee for the Pearl Harbor port dock in Hawaii is $8,485,000, the housing construction fee is $4,214,000, the gymnasium is $125,000, other equipment fees there is $3,785,000, Mare Island aspect is $2,070,000, Prahn Sang aspect dock project $3,000,000, Guam Naval Station $75,000, Samoa Naval Station $186,000, Hawthorne Armory $1,260,000, Walker Island Ordnance Depot $223,500, Sandia practice Station $525,000, Sandia Destroyer Base $250,000, Sandia Naval Air Station $321,000, Pearl Harbor aircraft base $20,000 bonus, other $480,000, Panama Canal Base $2,070,000, Pearl Harbor other expenses $355,000, and other naval station expenses $545,000, and allocates $1,710,000 to build a floating dock in Pearl Harbor. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

(London) The naval budget for 1939-40 was formulated yesterday, totaling £153,666,000. The Navy Department recently issued an order to increase the number of officers of all ranks, especially lieutenants, so that they can be sent to serve after the completion of the warships under construction. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### British Home Secretary's Speech Optimistic About European Situation; Advocates Formulation of Five-Year Peace Plan; Italy Has Not Yet Made Territorial Demands to France

(London) British Home Secretary Hoare recently delivered a speech at the Chelsea Constituency Conservative Party branch, expressing extreme optimism about the future of the international situation. His words were roughly as follows: "We now assume that the peoples of European countries have politically regained an optimistic view and jointly formulate a five-year plan, the greatness of which can exceed any five-year plan. During these five years, there will be no wars or rumors, and the people of European countries will not have to bear military expenditures, nor will they be surrounded by nightmares. If this can be achieved, then all modern magical inventions can be used to create a golden age, reduce poverty to a minimum, and raise living standards to unprecedented levels. I sincerely hope that the world's major politicians will not miss this great opportunity. There are now five great politicians in Europe, including three dictators (referring to the dictators of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union), as well as the Prime Ministers of Britain and France. If they can work together with one heart and soul, and with the support of the President of the United States, they can thoroughly transform world history in a very short period of time and become permanent benefactors of mankind. Is this not wonderful? Our Prime Minister has already expressed his determination to work tirelessly and spare no effort. I dare not believe that the leaders of other European countries are unwilling to cooperate with him." (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Italian Ambassador Grandi this morning to discuss the international situation. The Ambassador still did not elaborate on Italy's intentions towards France, only stating that Italy has no territorial demands on France. Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately met with French Ambassador Corbin for discussion, but the dispute between France and Italy was not mentioned. It is rumored that Foreign Secretary Halifax has conveyed the Italian demands to Ambassador Corbin, which is not true. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

(Paris) The French Foreign Ministry today denied reports from London. According to the report, Italy sent a note to France this week regarding Italy's territorial demands in Africa. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry here said that the London report was completely unfounded. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

(London) Tonight's commentaries all mention the optimism expressed by political interviewers this morning regarding the European situation and the possibility of disarmament negotiations. The "Evening Standard" said that the recovery of the stock exchange and the sudden breakthrough of haze and optimism are not without reason, and are based on various facts. Some say that Britain will launch a new disarmament conference, but this statement is doubtful. Britain has previously led by example in disarmament, hoping to pacify the world, but ultimately failed. Therefore, a new initiative to stop the arms race should now be undertaken by other countries. Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that London now has the impression that the Spanish war cannot be delayed any longer, which is an important element in European appeasement. The recent easing of the situation may be a precursor to finding a way for France and Italy to hold discussions on their disputes before the situation develops disturbingly. As for seeking universal disarmament, it is still the goal of the British government. Londoners do not tend to attach excessive importance to Italy's informal demands on France. The opinions expressed by the diplomatic interviewers of various newspapers believe that future discussions may focus on the Djibouti issue and the status of Italian expatriates in Tunis, and there are no absolute difficulties in these two points. Most people believe this is the case. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

### Korean Revolutionary Soldiers Send Letter to Japanese Friends Denouncing Deception by Japanese Military and Praising Heroic Spirit of Chinese Army

(Chongqing) A certain Korean revolutionary soldier, who has joined the Chinese army, wrote a letter to his anti-war Japanese friends, saying, "Since I surrendered to China, I now feel that the policies of the Japanese military are wrong. Now I understand more clearly the fact that the military deceived us. After surrendering to the Chinese army, I was treated favorably by them, which I admired with great amazement. Especially this time, the Koreans who participated in the Chinese army in the war against imperialism, I witnessed this heroic spirit, and the Chinese army's brave spirit of resistance, made me more repentant of my past mistakes. Your actions are correct. I hope you will strive hard. This war for justice will surely win the final victory. At the same time, I hope that you must work with the Volunteer Army to carry out anti-war work and achieve our wish." (Dispatch, 11th)

### Guangzhou Lacks Food Supplies; Japanese Military Searches Residences, Causing Chinese Rumors

(Guangzhou) The Japanese military authorities in Guangzhou have begun house-to-house searches in various suspicious locations due to the increasing number of crimes in the city. A section of the area between the Iron Bridge of the British Concession of Shamian and Huangsha Station was cut off by the Japanese military and thoroughly searched. In addition to a detailed inspection of each house, the residents were also rigorously interrogated. The results are currently unknown. Only a few Chinese with their hands tied behind their backs were seen being taken away by the Japanese military. The Japanese side encountered a serious obstacle in this operation, as there is currently a shortage of rice in the city, causing great hardship for the poor. For the past few days, new rice from the countryside has not been transported to Guangzhou for some unknown reason, causing rice prices to soar and most citizens unable to afford it. The Guangzhou "Chinese" and Japanese authorities are now doing their best to remedy this serious situation. The first step is to order a ban on the export of rice. It is reported that the Japanese search of houses has caused various rumors, such as the assassination of a Chinese official of the puppet city government, the wounding of a Japanese sentinel, and the assassination of a Chinese police officer. The Japanese military police authorities have strongly denied the above rumors and are now investigating the source of these rumors. A mass meeting was held in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall a few days ago. During the speeches, several people called on members of various trade associations and shop owners to resume business immediately. After the meeting, they marched in procession through various thoroughfares. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

### Famous French Journalist, Madame Chamming, Arrives in Chongqing

(Chongqing) Madame Chamming, a famous French journalist representing "L'Echo de Paris," has arrived in China for a visit. She also writes for "Medical News," "Youth News," and "Student News." These newspapers are mostly among the best of the right-wing French newspapers. The tone of the left-wing French newspapers has long expressed deep sympathy for China's resistance war. Now that the right-wing newspapers have also sent reporters to pay a friendly visit, it shows a glimpse of the trend of international public opinion. (Dispatch, 11th)

### Cardinal Maglione Appointed Vatican Secretary of State; New Pope to be Crowned Today; Gu Weijun Travels to Rome to Attend

Vatican City: Pius XII has appointed Cardinal Maglione, the former Ambassador to France, as the Vatican Secretary of State. He is currently 62 years old and served as the envoy to France from 1924 until 1935. He strongly supported the peace policy promoted by the late French Foreign Minister Briand.

(Chongqing) According to diplomatic sources, after Bishop Pacelli was elected Pope, Chairman Lin of the National Government sent a telegram of congratulations.

### Chinese Army Sadly Bids Farewell; Haizhou Falls; Xin Liya Turns Puppet

Haizhou Correspondence: Haizhou is located in the center of the Longhai Railway, at the intersection of the Yellow Sea and the Rose River, with a strategically important location. It is famous for its salt production. Lianyungang, the terminal of the Longhai Railway, is an important military port. On the morning of the 5th, the Japanese army units of Yamamoto, Nakajima, and Sawada invaded Haizhou in five routes. Han Deqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Subei Guerrilla Forces, personally led the units of Miao Chengliu and Yu Bizhong, and three regiments of the Self-Defense Corps, to bravely resist. They once broke through the North Gate, and the battle was fierce and unprecedented. The residents of Haizhou had already been evacuated. The tracks and sleepers near Haizhou on the Longhai Railway were completely dismantled, and the road surface was thoroughly destroyed. The strong bunkers, bridges, and warehouses along the Rose River built by the Chinese army were terribly bombed. On the 6th, the Japanese army units of Horii and Hisano detoured from Huaiyin and attacked the outskirts of Haizhou. The Yamaguchi Japanese Air Force Brigade bombed the Chinese army positions and the Longhai Line. Warships and gunboats constantly approached from the sea. Chairman Han, who had fought for a long time, had to withdraw from Haizhou in tears, sadly bidding farewell to the second line of national defense of the Longhai Railway. The vanguard of the Japanese army, the units of Ikuta and Katano, first entered the Dongdou Renchang. Xin Liya, the principal of Haizhou Elementary School, organized a puppet maintenance association.

### Third National Education Conference: Adhering to the Three Principles of the People to Ensure Education is Coordinated with Military Strength and Economy to Achieve Victory in the War of Resistance and Success in National Reconstruction

(Chongqing) The Third National Education Conference has concluded. This conference had a total of 316 proposals, including 8 on educational administration, 21 on elementary education, 27 on secondary education, 47 on higher education, 8 on normal school education, 38 on social education, 23 on frontier education, 9 on overseas Chinese education, 11 on moral education, and 31 on physical education and military training, as well as 139 motions. The entire content was exceptionally rich, and its spirit was comprehensively expressed in the declaration issued by the conference. Its fundamental essence is to consistently adhere to the Three Principles of the People and to coordinate education with military strength and the economy to achieve the goal of victory in the War of Resistance. The proposals discussed at the conference were largely centered on the various educational improvement proposals submitted by the Ministry of Education for discussion, which were thoroughly reviewed. The attending members fully expressed their experiences and research findings, providing many suggestions for improving education at all levels. The main points are summarized as follows: First, how to make education suitable for wartime measures; second, how education can meet China's needs and achieve the goal of balanced development; third, how to cultivate balanced development in moral, intellectual, and physical aspects. All these points are major issues that the conference sought to resolve reasonably. (10th dispatch)

Text of Two Provisional Motions

(Chongqing) The Third National Education Conference passed two provisional motions. The first was "Accepting Chairman Chiang's instructions at this conference as the highest guiding principle for our country's education in the future." The second was "Matters that should receive special attention in education during the great era of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction." The former establishes the fundamental principles of education, while the latter specifies the concrete guidelines for education. These are significant developments for our country's education in the future. The texts of the two motions are recorded below:

(1) Accepting Chairman Chiang's instructions at this conference as the highest guiding principle for our country's education in the future.

At the third plenary session of this conference, Chairman Chiang personally delivered instructions with foresight and earnest advice. The points he indicated are truly golden rules for current education. This conference should unanimously accept them as the highest guiding principles for our country's education in the future, and vigorously promote and implement their implementation plan. The Ministry of Education is requested to formulate and issue orders separately for implementation.

(2) Matters that should receive special attention in education during the great era of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.

(Explanation) The principles of education do not change due to wartime. To fulfill the mission of resisting the war on one hand and building the nation on the other, the only way is to use a normal attitude on basic facilities, so that the teachers strive to teach and the students strive to learn, there is no other simple way to be effective. But in this unprecedentedly difficult war of resistance, the ability of young people to adapt to the environment is more needed than before the war, especially thinking about how to remedy the sores and phlegm after the war, and how to support and nurture the vitality, the responsibility for the second generation of nationals is more serious. To cultivate the ability of future young people to shoulder the constant arduousness, without the education authorities taking responsibility now, there is no other hope. Our central and local educational administrative organs, educational institutions and educational groups have already made many practical contributions to this demand, and now it is appropriate to promote it more actively, and the authorities should consider the implementation method according to the local situation and put it into effect on some recognized important matters. (A) Educational institutions, (1) Educational circles across the country, whether teachers, scholars, young people, old people, should all be inspired, brave and diligent, and earnestly practice the general mobilization outline of the national spirit advocated by the highest leader, anytime and anywhere, the life of being drunk and dreaming of death must be corrected, the vigorous spirit must be increased, the habit of perfunctory survival must be eliminated, the selfish plan must be broken, and the divergent and complicated thoughts must be corrected. (2) In addition to the regular classes, each school may set up wartime lectures or current affairs discussion groups, etc., depending on the ability of the students, collect books, newspapers and magazines about the war of resistance, and the school authorities should invite teachers from the school or experts from outside the school or those with considerable experience to lecture or lead the discussion. In addition to war news, the content should pay special attention to the enemy's situation and the international situation. (3) Students who have reached a considerable age may, according to their academic ability, engage in various direct and indirect work beneficial to the War of Resistance in their spare time and holidays, depending on local needs, such as war zone services, rear services, conscription propaganda, and general propaganda, etc. In areas in the rear that have been attacked by enemy aircraft, attention should also be paid to rescue work. The above work must be led by the faculty and staff of each school to carry out orderly and organized actions to cultivate their good habits. (4) In order to engage in the above work, special training on various knowledge and skills should be given outside of the regular classes. (5) The curriculum of each department should collect important information directly and indirectly related to the War of Resistance as supplementary teaching materials. (6) If students are willing to receive special and strict military training in the school as basic preparations for junior officers and air force personnel, if their age and physical strength are qualified, each school should try to provide them with the opportunity to receive this education within the possible scope. (B) Educational and Youth Administrative Organs, (7) Educational administrative organs at all levels should expand as much as possible and accelerate the implementation of special wartime education aimed at the general public, and production education to provide a prosperous national economy. (8) Educational administrative organs at all levels should, according to local needs, conduct war zone service education in addition to formal education. (9) Educational administrative organs at all levels should pay extreme attention to the talents urgently needed in the War of Resistance, expand as much as possible and accelerate the training, and should effectively contact the organs that employ these talents. (10) The Ministry of Education should hire and transfer personnel to form a special organ to be responsible for the research, design and promotion of education in the war zone and the enemy's rear, and the liaison and coordination of various related aspects. (11) The material treatment of educational workers in the war zone and the enemy's rear should be appropriately improved, and at the same time, ways should be found to adjust the material treatment of educational workers in the rear. (12) When the Ministry of Education handles the relief of primary and secondary school teachers in the war zone, special attention should be paid to assigning work directly and indirectly related to the War of Resistance.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Tightens, Cash Gold Rises Very Slightly

Yesterday's spot gold market in the black market was still in a chaotic situation at the beginning of the morning. Because foreign exchange was loose and hard, and cash gold was sold at low prices, the price once dropped to a low of 2,060 yuan. However, there were very few transactions at that time. Later, foreign exchange was fiercely traded by the United Reserve Bank of North China and other banks, causing the potential to turn from loose to tight. As a result, people's hearts were shaken and the trading wind became steeper. Moreover, most retail investors who sold short came back in, and foreign banks were also actively involved behind the scenes. Therefore, the market price rose again, and the transaction supply increased with the time. The noon closing price once reached 2,089 yuan. In the afternoon, because cash gold continued to be sold, it fell back to 2,080 yuan at the closing. The final exchange rate rose by 5 yuan. People's hearts were slightly settled, and the transaction was slightly cleaner than the previous day, about 750 taels. Silver jewelry was listed at 2 yuan higher. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold tended to be stagnant.

Spot Gold Only Rises by 5 Yuan

At the beginning of the morning, because the potential of foreign exchange was loose, most of those who entered were temporarily skeptical, so the selling price was shouted down from 2,080 yuan to 70 yuan before trading started. First, a silver shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange for 2,070 yuan, which was the opening price, 5 yuan lower than the previous closing. After the opening, a certain cash gold shop was very eager to sell, and did not hesitate to sell at a low price, so the price fell by 10 yuan. The cash gold shop sold 50 taels to a securities company for 60 yuan, which was the lowest price. At that time, foreign exchange stopped loosening and turned tight, and the downward trend intensified, and the price immediately rebounded. There were more buyers, and the money exchange entered 50 taels of silver shop at 63 yuan, and another money exchange also entered 50 taels of securities company at 68 yuan. After that, a certain cash gold shop continued to sell, so it fell back. A certain money exchange absorbed 50 taels of cash gold shop on behalf of a foreign bank at 65 yuan. Later, another money exchange also entered 50 taels of silver shop at 64 yuan. After a certain silver shop sold short, it soon bought back 50 taels of cash gold shop at the original price. After that, the cash gold shop stopped selling and watched, and there were very few sellers, and the step-up was very severe. The gold shop entered 50 taels of silver shop at 70 yuan. A certain money exchange absorbed 50 taels of silver shop on behalf of a foreign bank, priced at 74 yuan, and then entered 50 taels of gold shop priced at 80 yuan. Later, the money exchange mutually traded 50 taels at 85 yuan, and then mutually traded 50 taels at 89 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because there was no market for foreign exchange on Saturdays, the transaction was sparse. Only because the cash gold shop continued to sell, it tended to be weak. First, the cash gold shop sold 50 taels to the money exchange at 86 yuan. After that, there was a greater lack of entrants, and the cash gold shop sold another 50 taels to the money exchange, and it fell to 80 yuan. Before long, the same money exchange mutually traded 50 taels at the same price. After that, supply and demand became even scarcer, and the price was stagnant. By the time after 4:00 pm, it was still not open, so the evening closing price was 2,080 yuan, which was 5 yuan higher than the previous day. The difference between the whole day was 29 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand gold was 2,090 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,075 yuan. The current standard gold is listed at 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are no transactions.

Jewelry Gold Jumps Up by 2 Yuan

At the beginning, the exchange of jewelry gold per tael did not change, but at 11:35 AM, because the potential of spot gold turned strong, it was also listed at 2 yuan higher. Datonghang changed to hang 212 yuan, Xinhanghang 210 yuan, and purchased at 204 yuan.

Customs Pure Gold Remains Unchanged

The London electricity on the 10th reported that British pure gold was stagnant again, and the price was still 7 pounds, 8 shillings and 3 pence per ounce. The People's Bank of China's cash purchase price was also stagnant at 1,210 yuan and 0.03 yuan. The listed customs gold has not changed, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price has also not changed, remaining at 1,205 yuan and 6 jiao.

### Rising Foreign Currencies

Yesterday, British pure gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by 0.125. The supply of foreign exchange in this port initially eased, with ample supply from foreign telegraphic transfers. Foreign firms were eager to settle accounts, but banks' absorption capacity was not strong, leading to a period of strong prices. In the afternoon, demand from foreign firms increased, with yarn and cloth merchants actively purchasing. However, banks were not eager to sell, leading to a soft market. Ultimately, the supply of British and American exchange became slightly tight, causing confusion and uncertainty among speculators. Major players remained on the sidelines, while small investors quickly entered and exited the market, resulting in unstable prices. Initially, prices eased along with the availability of drafts, allowing small investors to realize some profits. Later, news of tighter drafts revived the interest of wealthy individuals in taking long positions, using gold shops and currency exchange businesses to buy. Tianjin merchants also began to acquire, with most market participants expecting higher prices, partly due to the higher gold prices in Tianjin, which made arbitrage profitable, and partly because wealthy individuals who had bought at higher prices previously were unwilling to cut their losses and hoped to buy at lower prices. With supply remaining weak, prices rose slightly. Wealthy individuals resumed absorbing British and American gold pounds, and demand for various foreign currencies increased, driving market prices higher. Retail transactions were brisk, while exchange transactions were rare, with only Yongtai selling a US dollar draft for 1,000 yuan from Qin Taijin, and Changtai selling French franc drafts for 2,000 from Fuhexiang. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds rise by 50 cents each, British gold drafts by 14 cents, US dollar drafts by 0.75 cents, Hong Kong drafts by 8 cents, French franc drafts by 1.75 cents, Singapore drafts by 2 cents, Canadian drafts by 6 cents, Philippine drafts by 2 cents, Australian gold drafts by 20 cents, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Loan (Continued)

— Sheng Mujie

(4) The Application of the Sino-British Loan

This Sino-British loan of 5 million pounds is solely intended to serve as an exchange stabilization fund. Therefore, discussing the application of the Sino-British loan is equivalent to discussing the application of the exchange stabilization fund.

An exchange stabilization fund is quite capable of adapting to circumstances in controlling foreign exchange. Since China recognizes that the current foreign exchange control measures are not perfect, the application of this exchange stabilization fund should be able to eliminate these shortcomings. However, there are also limitations in the application process: (1) If exchange rate fluctuations are due to fundamental reasons such as price levels and international balance of payments, the function of the application is relatively narrow; but if it is based on temporary, unnatural reasons such as exchange speculation and capital flight, it can exert a great function. (2) It can exert a supreme function when the domestic financial market does not promote expansion or contraction, but only maintains stability; however, if it is accompanied by expansion or contraction, the results of the application must be pre-emptively guarded against. However, within the possible range, it can still adapt to exchange rate fluctuations and the needs of the domestic economy, and exert its subtle effect in an appropriate manner.

Currently, China is implementing strict foreign exchange control and trade management, making it not difficult to achieve a balance in international payments, and the domestic financial market is also based on maintaining stability as a principle. Therefore, there is no doubt that the application of this loan will be able to exert a great function. Moreover, the establishment of the exchange fund originally originated in Britain. Now that China's exchange stabilization fund is established in London and operated in the same way as the British exchange stabilization fund, its future success is certain. According to diplomatic correspondents in the daily telegrams, technical arrangements have now been made. According to this arrangement, it is expected that this amount—referring to 5 million pounds—can very well consolidate China's monetary system and resist the destructive methods currently implemented by Japan. The results of the application are conceivable.

(5) The Sino-British Loan and the Future of the Foreign Exchange Black Market

Since March 14 of last year, China's Ministry of Finance has implemented import foreign exchange controls to seek a balance in international trade and to control the escape of domestic funds by limiting the sale of foreign exchange. Later, it implemented export foreign exchange controls to promote the export of local products in order to collect foreign currency to replenish the foreign exchange fund. Although this policy has been quite successful, the legal exchange rate of the fiat currency has remained stable. However, the exchange rate in the black market has been declining in a straight line from March to July, and only after July did it begin to stabilize at the level of eight pence. However, when people were panicking, there were even views that it would fall to six pence. Why did it stabilize at the eight-pence level? Japanese observers say that it was maintained through cooperation between the Chinese government and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. In fact, anyone who pays attention to foreign exchange news knows that when the black market is tight, Hong Kong sends telegrams to sell, and when it is loose, it sends telegrams to buy. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation also adopts the same steps. The Japanese observation is not without reason.

Now that China has borrowed 5 million pounds to establish an exchange stabilization fund of 10 million pounds, it is naturally a great threat to the black market. Consider the following market prices:

However, whether it is possible for the black market to lengthen to the point where it is equal to the official price is still a question. The Japanese collecting fiat currency to obtain foreign exchange, the continued trade deficit in Shanghai, and other environmental restrictions still leave room for the existence of the black market. Because all of these are factors that allow the black market to exist, as evidenced by the fact that the black market has remained pegged at eight pence since July of last year. Therefore, the future of the foreign exchange black market is that the exchange rate will never fall again, but will have a tendency to lengthen, but will never be equal to the official price. Recently, Tianjin yarn and cloth merchants have been selling off in large quantities, while the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has been absorbing in large quantities. This situation can also prove the same point. Reuters电传宋子良谈话, [Reuters reported on the 9th with a telegram citing Song Zi Liang]: The currency steps taken by China last year have been proven correct by experience. Although the successive falls of Jiujiang, Guangzhou, and Hankou triggered speculative actions, the foreign exchange market has remained firm. The Bank of China was even able to repurchase all of the foreign exchange used to support the fiat currency in any serious military setback during the quiet market. A detailed analysis of this statement makes it easy to understand the relationship and impact of the Sino-British exchange fund loan on the foreign exchange black market!

So, can the Sino-British exchange stabilization fund loan eliminate the black market exchange rate? Then, the enemy of the black market exchange rate is the time factor. As China approaches final victory day by day, the exchange stabilization fund will exert its function day by day, and the black market exchange rate will lengthen to the official price day by day.

(6) The Sino-British and "Japanese Puppet" Economic War

The establishment of this Sino-British loan comes at a time when the Japanese puppets are scheduled to ban the circulation of Chinese fiat currency in North China on March 10 and implement foreign exchange controls, and when China is holding a local financial conference in Chongqing to focus on discussing how to purchase important materials and raw materials to prevent them from being used by the "Japanese puppets," and how to use provincial banknotes to penetrate and circulate in guerrilla areas to resist the circulation of "Japanese puppet" paper money. It is clearly an economic retaliatory act against Japan's attempt to devalue the fiat currency and exclude foreign interests in North China, and China's domestic arrangements for using this loan. Therefore, comparing this loan matter and the financial conference with the "Japanese puppet" measures in North China on March 10, it is known that it is an economic war between the Sino-British and the "Japanese puppets." Because China wants to maintain the stability of currency and finance in wartime, and Britain wants to maintain China's interests, free from Japanese suppression and infringement, they can only unite and counter the "Japanese puppets" with joint economic actions, to break its ambitious attempts. The joint establishment of the exchange stabilization fund by the Sino-British is one such joint economic action. (End)

### North China Again Comes with a Fierce Settlement; Foreign Exchange Returns to Tight Situation; Yarn and Cloth Merchants Once Had Dumping

The foreign exchange market initially saw a surge in supply from foreign banks. Although foreign firms were settling accounts at that time, the market felt that the position was still ample, so the underlying trend was once slightly hard. Afterwards, due to the sudden and fierce purchases by speculators in North China and the "Joint Reserve Bank of North China," the situation changed from loose to tight. As a result, it softened slightly. However, yarn and cloth merchants came to dump in the middle, but it had no impact. Half-day trading was still brisk. The Hong Kong exchange rate also tended to tighten slightly due to the strong purchasing by Chinese banks.

In the early morning, the London large bills, near-term returned to grow by 1.125, long-term continued to grow by 0.0625, New York's silver price remained stagnant, and London's raw gold also had no rise or fall. The exchange rate between British and American currencies was higher by three haos, higher against France by three shengdings, higher against Shanghai by 0.0625, American against British was higher by 1.125, higher against France by 0.0625, higher against Shanghai by 1 jiao, and the central government's quotations remained the same. The bank's selling price for British exchange was 8 bans 34375, and for American exchange was 16 yuan 3125, which was tighter by 0.015625 for British and softer by 0.03125 for American compared to the previous close. After the opening, although the major foreign firms were purchasing, it was not as if the foreign banks' supply was ample, so the situation turned out to be loose and hard. Foreign firms settled accounts, Holland, Macalister, and a certain bank bought British exchange at 8 bans 375 and American exchange at 16 yuan 375. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's quotations were announced to remain unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be large at 7.5%, calculated at 8.50%. Afterwards, although Chinese merchants and yarn and cloth merchants came to dump, the underlying trend turned from loose to tight due to the sudden and fierce purchases by speculators in North China and the "Joint Reserve Bank of North China." There was an advantage in absorbing the American exchange from the yarn and cloth merchants, which narrowed from 16 yuan 375 to 3125. At that time, foreign banks supplied Hong Kong exchange to Chinese merchants at 56 yuan 125, and the situation also tended to tighten slightly. Near noon, foreign firms again purchased and settled accounts, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's British exchange at 8 bans 34375, and the situation turned flat. At the noon close, the bank's selling price for British exchange was 8 bans 34375, and for American exchange was 16 yuan 3125, which was no different from the morning opening. As a result, compared to the previous close, British was tighter by 0.015625, American was softer by 0.03125, and Hong Kong exchange was also more expensive by 0.125. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

### Securities, Government Bonds Naturally See Decline

Securities gray market, yesterday's market surprisingly turned around, as this newspaper had expected. However, major players were mostly afraid that it would fall from here, and were watching in the morning. In the afternoon, there was a sudden pull-up to make a final effort. This kind of restricted situation is probably not something that a small number of people can control. Market prices are due to the fact that the situation on the surface is no longer the same, and the selling sentiment is gradually strong. The so-called large loan is actually only 5 million pounds. The rise in recent days has felt excessive, so the situation changes and it is easy to fall. In the afternoon, Class E initially wanted to raise the price to the closing price, but was suppressed by Qiafeng, and the trend and future should be a curved decline. Yesterday's experience, the opening was slightly fatigued and without much change due to the purchase of numbers 4 and 5. Afterwards, number 20 completely withdrew and did nothing, and the sellers such as numbers 7, 11, 13, and 15, as well as Defu Qiafeng Hengfu, all sold, so the market price could not be maintained, and the reaction suddenly rose, falling by one yuan. Then, Dafeng Mao Da and number 49 all made small additions, rising slightly, but already falling by 6 jiao to 9.5 jiao. In the afternoon, number 20 came to pull up again, but only specialized in trading Class E and Class C, and the rest had more sales and fewer entries, so the market price had a deformed situation. The rest, numbers 5 and 15, bought back slightly, but Tongkang Qiafeng and number 72 still sold, so the price increase felt twice the effort. The competition was fiercest at the close, and the result was still that the sellers had the upper hand. The market price finally fell slightly by 1 jiao to 5.5 jiao, Class A fell by 5.5 jiao, and Class E only fell by 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was around one million yuan.

### Yarn and Cloth, A Large Batch of Indian Cotton Arrives in Port This Morning, American Cotton Industry Proposals Still Have Many Branches

Foreign cotton market prices, the Smith Cotton Industry Proposal that all parties have been yearning for for a long time, although it was passed by the Agricultural Committee of the Senate yesterday, it was fiercely opposed by the Cotton Farmers' Federation, and has been presented to President Roosevelt, requesting amendments. The purpose of the Smith Proposal is to clear all government loan cotton within five years, and to prevent the excess of new cotton in the future. The Smith Cotton Industry Proposal still has many branches, so the New York cotton market is afraid of changes. Yesterday, New York rose by six or seven pounds at the opening due to short covering, and the later market was very stagnant. India, including forecasts, rose by more than one rupee, and Egypt rose by more than 20 pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate tightened slightly, and the converted legal currency and cotton prices all rose. It is calculated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 6 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by 6 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 1 yuan and 8 jiao.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading, previously because Indian cotton was cheaper, all parties' attention was focused on this. Recently, because the shipping costs between India and China are very tight, most of the orders placed earlier have not been able to arrive on time. (The voyage between India and China can take four weeks.) It is difficult for each factory to have enough cotton in stock for one or two months. However, because the source of this cotton is almost exhausted, even if high prices are paid, it is difficult to purchase satisfactory cotton. Therefore, each factory's vision for purchasing foreign cotton in the future will shift towards American cotton. Yesterday, foreign cotton trading was very quiet. Each cotton shop had a strong intention to purchase Rangoon cotton, but because the local area did not have a good harvest, the asking price was very high. A certain foreign firm in this port telegraphed yesterday to inquire, and the reply was that the price could not be reduced, so there was no transaction. The cotton prices of yesterday are listed below.

The British company Alipore transported more than 6,640 tons of Indian cotton from Mumbai, totaling more than 16,000 pieces (yesterday's report mistakenly calculated more than 28,000 pieces). It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, but according to the company, the ship can enter the port at 8:00 am this morning and dock at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong. There is also more than 1,000 tons of cotton to be transported to Japan. After the cotton transported to Shanghai is unloaded, it will go to Japan to deliver the goods.

The local cotton business is unusually dull and unremarkable. This is because the inventory is thin and the arrival of goods is interrupted, so transactions are increasingly rare. Only Shenxin Factory has recently made some purchases. There were only three transactions yesterday, and the remaining firms did not make any transactions. The arrival of goods at the pier is also rare. Only 181 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, and there are also reports of Yao cotton arriving in Shanghai, but the amount is unknown. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

### Actual Sales Stalled; Fine Yarn Declines; Each Falls by 5 Yuan to 7 Yuan

The yarn market remains weak and sluggish, and the momentum is extending downward. This is because current sales are not rising, customers' appetites are sluggish, people's hearts are weak, and the spot goods of general retail investors who have been issued tickets are particularly fierce in the market. At the same time, speculators, in view of the loose surface, have no intention of activity. However, some are unwilling to open sales at low prices because cotton prices are firm and expensive. The firm and upright fine yarn and thread market is also trending downward, with a sudden drop of 5 yuan to 7 yuan.

The situation of spot yarn, the opening in the early morning, the market is a quiet scene, colleagues gather together, mostly say that the actual transaction does not move, brokers entrustment, are all selling transactions, large amounts, quietly did not move, so the market is still in the middle, the decline is not seen violent. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at a price similar to the previous day, at 398 yuan. Afterwards, with no appetite for customer sales, it softened step by step, and finally fell to 395 yuan. The warehouse receipt price was 392.5 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was due to the weekend relationship, the transaction was clear, and the number of people gathered was rare, and the market price gradually fatigued by one yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 394 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 392 yuan. The factory did not move, the market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 5 yuan compared to the previous day, Tiannv fell by 4 yuan, Te Jin Cheng fell by 4.5 yuan, and 42-count Cat Butterfly fell by 7 yuan. Today's export of cotton yarn is 670 pieces, shipped to Shantou, 20 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 75 pieces shipped to Fuzhou, 240 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 195 pieces shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 1,140 pieces shipped to Haiphong. The amounts bought by each group are listed on the left.

Although the Japanese yarn market is crowded with people, the actual demand is particularly quiet, the market price is flat and fatigued, and the sales are few. The current spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 332 yuan, and it could not be sold in the afternoon. The current spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 324 yuan, and as a result, it has fallen by another one yuan compared to the previous day.

### Grains, Another Large Batch of White Rice Arrives in Shanghai, Indica Rice is Still Limited to the Price Limit, Guest Xian Rice Price Limit Will Be Raised by Half a Yuan Said Rice Merchants This Time Will Make a Big Profit

Source of Du Rice, River Bottom No. 5, car-transported buns 1,000 to 2,000 bags, the early market was slack, and the late market returned to tight, which became a fixed pattern. The thick and thin Indica price, except for the River Bottom goods, all arrived at the price limit, and there was no change. In fact, the price limit has been eliminated. Du Yangjian and Zhujian are similar, the changed yuan plus 3 jiao, the market goods opened at 19.5 yuan, and the Yin Yuan goods have been gone for a long time. Yesterday, a ship of Fengjing goods was launched, and it was sold out in an instant, with the price opening at 16.5 yuan. Although the large increase in rice prices this time was affected by the Japanese puppets transporting it out, it was not without its influence. However, Shanghai's rice reserves are abundant, and even if no grain of rice arrives, it should not rise so much. Moreover, the arrival of rice has gradually increased in recent days, but the market price has not loosened, so rice merchants will make a big fortune.

Guest Xian Rice, the guest gang and speculators are competing to handle it, and the number of transactions has increased to about 10,000 bags. The market price is blocked by the price limit of 13.5 yuan, so there is no difference in high rice, and the medium and secondary rice have continued to rise by several fen to nearly 1 jiao. It once returned to flat in the morning, and was then raised again by speculators. However, there is a rumor in the market that the price limit for guest Xian rice will be raised to 14 yuan, but according to news from Kuoye Zhong, it must wait until the joint meeting of the guild on Monday before a decision can be made.

Yesterday, Datong ship, also transported 10,447 bags of white rice from Hupu Kou, but Zhongyi Company's Ende ship went to Ningbo, transporting 16,000 bags of white rice.

### Factory Price Increases, Spot Flour Sales Resume, Japanese Factories Release Prices to Buy Local Wheat

Flour spot transactions gradually decreased, so the Nanyang gang all complained that the price was expensive. It is found that the recent factory prices are 5 fen higher for the northern and southern oceans, so the customer gang is unwilling to accept it. This street is also demanding a reduction in the factory price because it is particularly high. The factory said that there is not enough spot flour, and there may be a slight change next week, so the number of transactions has decreased from more than 50,000 bags to less than 30,000 bags. The wholesale of Mujie is also only about 7,000 bags. Today, 2,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Fuzhou, and 4,000 bags will be shipped to Xiamen.

The wheat market's factory sales are light. It is heard that within the next week, two ships of foreign wheat can arrive, amounting to 17,711 tons. Local wheat demand is weak, but there are Japanese flour factories raising prices to absorb it, and there have been several high-priced dark deals. As for open transactions in the market, they have stopped again.

### Silk Tea, Japanese Silk Falls Again, Shanghai Silk Has a Market But No Transactions

Yesterday, Yokohama silk once again poured down, the spot price fell by 35 yuan, and the forward price fell by 25 yuan, causing the people in Shanghai to be very weak. It is said that the Yokohama authorities restrict the price of silk, so that it returns to the record on January 10, then the price of silk in the East City seems to have a possibility of returning to 900 yuan. The New York silk market, Chinese and Japanese raw silk each returned to a small 4 points, causing silk transactions to remain impossible to expand.

The Shanghai silk market has a market but no transactions. The Shanghai silk price, such as the white factory B character, has not opened a new low price of falling to 1,800 yuan. However, according to the calculation of 2.14 yuan for Shanghai silk in the US market, the purchase price of Shanghai silk in the US has fallen to 1,620 yuan. With such a huge difference, it is of course not easy to negotiate. In short, this time the silk price has fallen back, one is due to the shift in speculation, and the second is due to the increase in the exchange rate, just like when it rose high, it was assisted by the expensive gold and cheap silver.

### Piece Goods, Min Gang Wang Ban, National Goods Registration Procedures Completed, East Piece Goods Customer Road Has No Transactions

National cloth due to the Japanese army's re-attack, actual sales are greatly affected, and the exchange rate is lengthening, some of the goods stored by speculators are willing to come out of the cage, so although the factory price is expensive, the market price has a difference of 100 cash in the open and dark markets. Only Yong'an Dapeng fine cloth Wenzhou gang specified to purchase, the selling price still insists on 13 yuan, other fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth hand goods have a loose price of 5 fen to 1 jiao. Zhejiang Gan gang handled 50 packages of fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth. Among the bleached and dyed goods, bleached cloth is the most popular to purchase, and nearly 200 boxes of Min Fuzhou gang were continuously transacted. Because the national goods' re-handling registration procedures have just been completed, and 36 factories have been temporarily approved to pack and ship. Yesterday, because the suspension of handling was quite long, the bidding was strong, and 400 boxes of color cloth, color twill, bleached cloth, Shilin cloth, and poplin were transacted, and they will be shipped next week.

East cloth white goods, the market atmosphere is still soft, and the customer road for Zazi cloth and fine twill has no transactions. Only 300 to 500 pieces of blank dye from this street are used as embellishments. The flow of buying and selling short in the market gathers extremely lively in the morning and evening markets, but there are few people doing transactions and many people visiting the market. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, hand goods are overflowing, and low bids are repeatedly seen, while other brands of fine cloth and fine twill can still barely stand.

Today's exports of piece goods include 445 pieces shipped to Shantou, 250 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 30 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 190 pieces shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 415 pieces shipped to Haiphong.

### Sugar Market, Jin Gang in Shantou, Handles Sugar in Large Quantities

National sugar is turning clear because the go wei is not smooth, and the numbers are transacted. However, according to the telegram from Shantou yesterday, the Jin gang is again handling in large quantities, so green, red, and white sugar have unanimously turned up by half a yuan. If you mention green and draw Shen, you need 15 yuan and 6 or 7 jiao, cotton red 15 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao to 15 yuan and a half, foot three tips about 24 yuan, Shangbing 23 yuan and a half, guild drawing, 24 Dutch crude white 24 yuan and 9 jiao, transshipment goods 16 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, and some call for 16 yuan and 7 jiao, Taikoo Che Bai B mark 24 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, there will be 200 bags of transactions.

Yesterday, there were 470 bags of sugar from Shantou, and another 550 bags from Xiamen.

### Oil Market, Transactions of Raw Oil Gradually Fade

Yesterday, the oil market hovered down, transactions were slow, only 50 pieces of peanut oil were transacted, the price of Jiaozhou oil was in the absence of supply, standing at the original plate, at 29 yuan and 5 jiao, soybean oil fell by 3, 4, or 5 jiao, and it is calculated that 150 barrels of Dalian spot barrel oil, the price is 30 yuan, 0 jiao, 2 and a half fen to 0 jiao, 1 fen, March's 200 barrels, the price is 30 yuan, 0 jiao, 1 fen and 5 fen to 30 yuan, and April's 300 barrels, the price is 30 yuan, 0 jiao, 1 fen and a half fen to 30 yuan, 0 jiao, 5 fen, also Lianqi large oil is quite in line with this market's appetite, so in the absence of goods, the market is bullish, doing open 50 pieces, the price is 28 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Spot Market Experiencing a Short-Term Increase

Yesterday, soybeans showed signs of returning to normalcy. Due to the frequent declines in futures prices, the market sentiment became slightly more optimistic. Consequently, the spot market became more active. Chongming sand soybeans, with inquiries from export businesses, saw a price increase of five cents, with over a thousand packages traded. The price ranged from eight yuan, three dimes and five cents to eight yuan and five dimes. Spot Dalian soybeans were delivered at a price of eight yuan, three dimes and four cents per cart. Five carts of April's Dalian soybeans were mutually opened by peers at prices ranging from eight yuan, two dimes and five cents to eight yuan, two dimes and one cent, continuing the downward trend from the previous day. Currently, soybean futures trading is largely driven by speculation. It is rumored that Japanese merchants directly released approximately four hundred carts of physical goods, representing a month's worth of trading in April. However, considering the recent physical sales activities, the future market trend is a matter of concern. According to records, 1,050 packages of soybeans arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday, and 2,000 packages were shipped to Hong Kong today. Additionally, 100 packages of sorghum and 1,800 packages of wheat bran were shipped to Xiamen.

### North-South Goods: Honey Dates in Short Supply

Honey dates are in short supply, with red-ink pricing. The price was once set at ninety-six yuan, but the market price eventually reached over one hundred yuan. Yesterday, the market heard that upper-tier merchants were asking for one hundred and six yuan, an increase of more than ten yuan from previous levels.

### Sundries: Heavy Arrival of Schisandra Berries, Orchid Seeds Expensive, New Jian Mushrooms Firm

Schisandra berries from Tianjin were previously selling for ninety yuan per dan (unit of weight) for high-quality goods. However, with the gradual influx of goods, the market weakened, dropping back to seventy yuan. Yesterday, they were only selling for sixty-five yuan.

New Jian mushrooms opened yesterday with eighteen consecutive listings. High-quality, thin mushrooms were priced at one hundred and ninety yuan and eight cents; special-grade thin mushrooms at one hundred and ninety-three yuan and two dimes; special-grade ridge mushrooms at two hundred and twenty yuan and nine cents; and thick mushrooms at two hundred and fifty-five yuan and five cents.

Only a few dozen pieces of orchid seeds arrived, all of medium to high quality, with a price increase of one yuan. Sales have resumed. Currently, there are only thirty to forty boxes in stock on the market. Especially bright yellow seeds are particularly scarce, and even ordinary goods are selling for thirty-three yuan.

### Coal: Sudden Drop in Coal Briquette Prices

Due to increased production from new factories, coal briquette prices had been firm since the beginning of spring. Unexpectedly, yesterday, due to the establishment of a new factory by a certain firm, shipments suddenly increased, and competition among peers led to a price drop. Yitai Xing's established brand of coal briquettes, sold by the company's own carts, was only selling for ninety-nine yuan per ton, a sudden drop of three yuan. Smaller factories also followed suit, dropping prices by varying amounts, up to two yuan.

### Hardware: High Costs (Continued), Sales Prices of All Goods Increased, Customers Hesitant

Tinplate: Transactions in this market, involving printing factories, canneries, and cigarette factories, are all actively procuring, and there are occasional inquiries from customer groups, so trading is quite active. The daily opening prices are recorded as follows (unit: yuan):

Company Iron: Although the red-ink pricing for this commodity has increased, the spot goods from foreign firms and the goods pledged to banks and money shops are being sold at low prices, causing market chaos. Sales prices vary greatly. For example, the publicly agreed price is fifty-six yuan per box, while the spot goods from foreign firms and the pledged goods from banks and money shops are only asking for fifty-three to fifty-four yuan, resulting in sluggish sales. Only canneries, cigarette factories, and tin printing factories in this market have a slight appetite. (To be continued)

### Citywide Lowering of Flags Today, Commemorating the Death of Premier Sun, City Party Headquarters Issues a Message to the People, Promoting the Revolutionary Spirit of Premier Sun, and Holding the Second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week

Today is the 14th anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Kuomintang. Flags will be flown at half-mast throughout the city for one day. At 8:00 AM, various groups, schools, factories, shops, etc., will independently hold small-scale commemorative meetings, reporting on Premier Sun's lifelong revolutionary career and the efforts that the people should make during the Anti-Japanese War. At 12:00 noon, citizens will stand silently in place to mourn the Premier and the soldiers who died in the front lines fighting against the enemy. All entertainment venues will voluntarily suspend business. Citizens throughout the city will contribute their daily savings to the government. The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters has also scheduled the second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week from today to the 18th. The schedule is as follows: the 12th is Commercial Day, the 13th is Industrial Day, the 14th is Agricultural Day, the 15th is Education Day, the 16th is Cultural Day, the 17th is Youth Day, and the 18th is Women's Day. The full text of the Shanghai City Party Headquarters' message to the people is as follows:

Mourning the Premier Requires Even More Resolute Resistance

Dear compatriots throughout the city, today is the 14th anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Father of the Republic of China, and the mentor of the world revolution. As we recall this day fourteen years ago, Premier Sun, on his deathbed, earnestly instructed us with his dying words, "Do not be softened by the enemy," and his final teaching, "Strive for peace to save China." Looking at our beautiful rivers and mountains, almost entirely ravaged by the enemy's iron hooves, and tens of millions of soldiers and compatriots, using their blood and heads, fighting arduously for the nation's permanent survival and international peace and justice, we truly feel infinite grief and boundless excitement. We deeply believe that, amidst the emotions of sorrowfully mourning the Premier's death today, all compatriots in the city will even more resolutely and unanimously call upon the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, to persevere in resisting the war to the end, only then can we win our country's final victory, and only then can we be worthy of the Premier's spirit in heaven.

The Dying Words Not to Be Softened by the Enemy

Premier Sun dedicated forty years to revolution. Based on his lifelong fighting experience, he deeply knew that the enemy's violence was not to be feared, the harshness of the environment was not to be feared, and the inferiority of manpower, financial resources, and material resources was also not to be feared. Only the softening and coercion of one's own spirit by the enemy was to be feared. Before the Xinhai Revolution, how much strength did the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) have? However, Premier Sun, relying on a small number of steadfast comrades, rose again and again after repeated setbacks, undeterred. The Wuchang Uprising ultimately overthrew the Qing Dynasty's rule of more than 260 years and swept away the autocratic regime of more than 3,000 years. This was not because the revolutionary party's manpower, financial resources, and material resources surpassed the Qing government, but because the revolutionary spirit of Premier Sun and his followers surpassed everything. The Qing government naturally collapsed. The success of the campaigns against Yuan Shikai and the protection of the constitution were also concrete results of the revolutionary spirit overcoming the enemy. At the time of his death, looking back on the past and considering the future, the thing that Premier Sun could not let go of was whether the people of the Republic of China and the members of the Chinese Kuomintang could deeply understand the only magic weapon in this revolutionary movement, the dying words "Do not be softened by the enemy," how profound, penetrating, and far-reaching they were!

The Supreme Leader Carries on the Dying Words and Advances

Fourteen years ago, when Premier Sun died in Beijing, our Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek was leading his troops to suppress the rebels in Guangdong and Guangxi. At a time of successive victories, he suddenly received the news of the revolution's mentor's passing. Filled with grief and indignation, he deeply believed that in order to complete Premier Sun's great revolutionary cause, it was necessary to deeply understand Premier Sun's dying words. In 1926, when the National Revolutionary Army swore to begin the Northern Expedition, the manpower, financial resources, and material resources of the Guangzhou National Government were far inferior to those of the warlord government. However, what was the weapon that Chiang Kai-shek used to overcome the enemy and achieve unification? It was this indomitable and arduous revolutionary spirit. This great revolutionary spirit was forged by the dying words "Do not be softened by the enemy." Upholding Premier Sun's great dying words, he was ultimately invincible and achieved success.

Crush the Enemy's Conspiracy to Coerce Our Spirit

This time, Japanese imperialism has frantically launched a war of aggression, attempting to realize its ambition of destroying China and conquering the world. Our Chairman Chiang leads the people of the whole country to rise up and resist the war. In the past twenty months, we have not only shattered the enemy's dream of a "quick victory" but also thwarted the enemy's conspiracy of a "quick peace settlement." The enemy's military strength, financial resources, and material resources are all superior to ours. How can we make the enemy fall into the quagmire and be unable to extricate themselves? The reason for this weakening of the strong and turning defeat into victory is that Chairman Chiang infused Premier Sun's revolutionary spirit into the hearts of soldiers and civilians throughout the country, using the steel-like will and fiery spirit of the whole country to deal with the enemy. The violent enemy naturally falls into a state of defeat. Today, the enemy's strategic and political plans have all failed, and our country's final victory is becoming increasingly imminent. At this time of strategic disorientation, the only way for Japanese imperialism to struggle is to attempt to soften our spirit of resistance and coerce our will to build the country through revolution. The absurd terms such as "building a new order in East Asia," "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere," and "Japan, Manchuria, and China are inseparable" are concrete manifestations of the intention to poison our spirit. Here we can see even more clearly the high and great vision of Premier Sun, which can be passed down for centuries, while the enemy's efforts are increasingly futile and their skills are exhausted.

Promote Our Premier's Revolutionary Spirit

Therefore, today, as we commemorate the death of Premier Sun with infinite emotion, we should even more promote Premier Sun's revolutionary spirit of not softening, not compromising, and not yielding, and fight against the violent enemy to the end. The resistance war cannot be stopped even for a single day until the enemy withdraws from Chinese territory. Since Shanghai fell into an isolated island, the revolutionary spirit of the compatriots throughout the city has been further promoted, and the revolutionary enthusiasm for loving the motherland has been increasing day by day. In order to enable compatriots from all walks of life, including agriculture, industry, commerce, students, youth, and women, to more deeply understand Premier Sun's revolutionary spirit of not compromising and not yielding, and to crush the enemy's conspiracy and trick to soften and coerce our spirit, we are holding the second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week from today, the anniversary of Premier Sun's death, to the 18th. We hope that compatriots from all walks of life will deeply understand that the enemy is bound to be defeated and we are bound to win, further strengthen the work of supporting the resistance against the enemy, and serve as an example for the people of the whole country. Only in this way can we be worthy of being Premier Sun's followers, and only in this way can we complete Premier Sun's unfinished great cause of "striving for peace to save China." The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

### Second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week, Commercial Day Today, Various Commercial Organizations Call on Compatriots in the Commercial Sector to Encourage the Promotion of Domestic Goods and the Development of the Interior

The Shanghai commercial organizations sent a letter to the commercial compatriots in the city, saying, "Fellow commercial compatriots of the city, today is the Commercial Day of the second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week in Shanghai. Since the withdrawal of the national army to the west, the commercial compatriots of the city have not only stood at their own posts and worked hard to promote domestic goods, but have also taken the lead in advocating and sparing no effort in movements such as donating money to the government and providing relief to refugees. This is something we can be somewhat gratified about to the compatriots of the whole country. However, with the post-resistance war already beginning today, on the one hand, our country's final victory is becoming more and more imminent, while at the same time, the arduousness and greatness of its tasks far outweigh the earlier stages. It goes without saying that the compatriots of the whole country need to strengthen their struggle and strive to move forward. Although Shanghai has fallen, Shanghai's position in the whole of China and in the eyes of the world still remains a very important part. The responsibility that our Shanghai commercial sector should bear is becoming even greater. Here are two things that we hope all commercial compatriots in the city will encourage each other to do:

First, we should further strengthen the promotion of domestic goods. Modern warfare is a war of national strength versus national strength, and the economy occupies the most important position in national strength. Everyone knows that the enemy's financial and economic exhaustion and distress have been brought on by launching a war of aggression. The only way to survive at present is to raise funds locally, exploit our people with violence, and dump crudely made and repackaged goods into our country, intending to dominate our market. Shanghai is the main base for the dumping of enemy goods. Regarding the former, the enemy has run into obstacles everywhere due to the expansion of our widespread guerrilla warfare and has failed to realize its conspiracy. Regarding the latter, the enemy is now putting all its efforts into this, arbitrarily reducing tariffs and dominating the Yangtze River shipping, not only excluding our country's domestic goods, but also attempting to deal a fatal blow to the goods of European and American countries. Our commercial compatriots are in this crisis and should be extra vigilant about the insidious nature of the environment and further strengthen our work of promoting domestic goods. It goes without saying that our city's compatriots are happy to use domestic goods. The key is how the commercial sector can make compatriots clearly distinguish between domestic goods and enemy goods. If we can widely promote and sell domestic goods, then the enemy's dumping policy will inevitably fail because our compatriots refuse to buy them.

Second, the city's industrial and financial sectors should work hard to develop the resources of the Northwest and Southwest. Our country is full of resources, especially abundant in the Northwest and Southwest. In the past, the industrial and financial sectors often concentrated their funds in cities and did not focus on the big picture from afar. Now that the national policy of long-term resistance war has been believed in and supported by the people of the whole country, then the work of developing the Northwest and Southwest is the inescapable responsibility of our industrial and financial sectors. We deeply hope that the leaders of the city's financial and industrial sectors will take the lead in advocating and actively investing. The government and the people will definitely provide the best possible assistance.

The above two points are the directions in which the commercial sector should make special efforts in the future, and are also the efforts that the commercial sector should make in the movement of resisting the war and building the country. Finally, we respectfully wish all commercial compatriots in the city successful efforts. The Joint Association of Shanghai Commercial Organizations.

Attached is an outline of efforts for Commercial Day:

### The Rice Market Experiences a Sharp Rise in Black Market Prices, Clearly Someone Is Manipulating the Market, Traders and Customers Are Taking the Opportunity to Monopolize, Enough to Hinder Normal Transactions, Concession Rice Shops Limit Prices for Fair Sales

Although the rice price in the city has appeared to be stable on the surface in recent days, in reality, the black market transactions between traders and customers have suddenly exceeded the limited price. The market situation is once again chaotic. Various customer groups have requested a relaxation of the price limit to fifteen yuan. The Bean and Rice Industry Association has scheduled a special meeting tomorrow to discuss the matter. The concession authorities believe that the sharp rise in the rice market is clearly being manipulated and have dispatched personnel to closely monitor and punish those who disrupt public order and food supply. As for the proposal to order foreign rice, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce has studied the matter and concluded that, due to the high overseas prices, including freight and other expenses, which are more expensive than the domestic rice market price, it is not possible to order foreign rice. The Rice Shop Industry Association has ordered all rice shops within the concession to uniformly sell rice at a fair price according to the price limit. The details of these situations are recorded below by a reporter from the Modern News Agency.

Chaotic Market Prices

Regarding the city's rice prices, due to the lack of sources from the interior, warehouse owners in the market are taking the opportunity to buy up goods, resulting in a sharp rise in recent days, exceeding the limited price. Fortunately, the Bean and Rice Industry Association resolved to maintain the high price limit of fourteen yuan per bag, and the Market Management Committee advised peers and traders to sell at fair prices and strictly enforce the association's resolutions. After the market price stabilized slightly and merchants continued to transport goods, the situation improved. However, starting on March 10, market transactions experienced drastic changes again. Although the limited price of fourteen yuan was still maintained on the surface, the actual rice and grain traded between traders and customers was traded at a black market price, close to fifteen yuan. Yesterday (March 11), after the market opened, the market price rose sharply again. The highest quality white japonica rice actually rose to fifteen yuan outside the concession on the black market. Although the market tried its best to suppress the price, it was unable to stop it. The trading situation was unprecedentedly chaotic, so the market closed at 11:00 AM.

Request for Relaxation

According to a reporter from the Modern News Agency, the rice market traders entering the market said that the rice price in the interior producing areas is high, almost equal to the limited price in Shanghai. In addition, after adding transportation costs and taxes, there is no profit to be made, so they requested a relaxation of the limited price to fifteen yuan per shi (unit of volume). The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association has specifically scheduled a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at 3:00 PM tomorrow (March 13) on the second floor of the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange to submit this request for discussion. According to the opinions of peers, if the issue of relaxing the price limit is approved by the association, it must also be approved by the Public Works Department before it can be implemented.

Authorities Monitoring

The Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Municipal Council of the French Concession are very concerned about the rice price in Shanghai and are still maintaining their original plan to regulate the food supply for the more than four million people within the concession. The two authorities are cooperating to maintain order. Recently, the sudden rise in the rice price in Shanghai has greatly affected the livelihoods of ordinary people. In addition to dispatching personnel to the market to monitor transactions, any trader or customer found to be taking the opportunity to manipulate the market and monopolize goods, sufficient to hinder normal transactions, will be severely investigated, dealt with, and punished to maintain public order and food supply. The industry association will also strictly prevent traders and customers from raising prices and disrupting the market. Those who are found will also be publicly punished as a warning and deterrent.

High Foreign Rice Prices

The Shanghai Rice Industry Association and its member rice shops have close ties because they sell directly to consumers, so the association has decided to maintain the limited price. It will also set retail market prices: white rice, indica rice, and white indica rice at fourteen yuan per shi, and second-class rice at thirteen yuan and four dimes per shi. The industry will be rectified to uniformly comply with the assessed market prices and implement fair sales to maintain public order and food supply.

High Foreign Rice Prices

According to a person in charge of the rice industry, there are currently 700,000 to 800,000 bags of rice in stock in Shanghai, equivalent to 1.2 to 1.3 million shi calculated in Shanghai bushels, which is enough to maintain the food supply in Shanghai for three months with surplus. Although there is a shortage of inventory in the interior producing areas, the daily shipments to Shanghai, no matter how much or little, can still make up for it, so there is no need to panic about the food supply for the time being. As for the Bean and Rice Industry Association, in order to plan for the future, it suggested in a letter to the two concession authorities that the authorities should prepare appropriate measures, such as ordering foreign rice or dredging sources. However, according to recent foreign market news, the rice production in Siam, Saigon, and other places was slightly less last year, and market prices have risen. It is not cost-effective to order foreign rice for shipment to Shanghai for relief. Based on the current rice stocks in Shanghai, there is no need to order foreign rice for the time being.

### Japanese Side Rumors Total Attack on Pudong, Chinese Army on High Alert, Even If the Japanese Army Has No Such Intention, the Chinese Army Will Definitely Launch First

Within the Pudong area, a traitor working within the Japanese army is spreading rumors to the outside world, saying that the Japanese army will take action again to invade the areas controlled by the guerrillas in order to eliminate the threat. However, according to general observations, the Japanese army's strength is weak, and the guerrillas' strength is strong, so this plan is unlikely to succeed. The details are recorded separately below:

Failed Invasion: During the spring of last year, the Japanese side took advantage of the opportunity of the retreat of troops from Hangzhou to invade the three counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. At that time, they had 10,000 troops, hoping to solve the guerrilla forces of the three counties in one fell swoop. However, the Chinese side's actions were elusive and did not cause any damage, so after most of the Japanese troops were transferred out within ten days, a small number of Japanese troops still retreated to the strongholds along the river, and the guerrillas still controlled their original areas. Last winter, the Japanese army attempted to invade in three routes and even penetrated into the Mud City on the coast of Nanhui and the old Fengxian City. As a result, because the hinterland of the three counties was crisscrossed by rivers and swamps, and the bridges were broken, all routes were cut off, so the Japanese troops on all routes were completely repelled by the guerrillas.

Failed Enticement: The Japanese side also suffered losses and casualties in repeated military operations, and its efforts were fruitless, so it changed its tactics from threats to enticement, repeatedly persuading the Chinese army with generous terms to stop hostilities in order to avoid worries about the rear. However, shameless persuaders were repeatedly executed by the Chinese side on charges of being traitors. Last year, people like Ren Pengfei died for this reason, so the "silver bullet" policy was completely defeated by the Chinese army.

Rumored Action: In recent days, traitors have revealed news that Sakurai, the commander of the Japanese Army Shanghai Garrison, summoned Uehiro, the commander of the Chuansha Garrison, Ogawa, the commander of the Nanhui Garrison, and Nakajima, the commander of the Fengxian Garrison, to a secret meeting, planning to forcibly transfer troops from the suburbs in secret, based on the current county seat of Chuansha, Zhoupu in Nanhui, and Fengxian. The three strongholds will then penetrate deeper into the hinterland of the three counties and attack the Chinese army in order to eliminate the threat and expand the puppet organization's territory. It is also rumored that action will begin after the weather clears, and the water traffic in western Pudong will be blocked at that time, causing unrest among the people in the Japanese army's area, and many plan to relocate temporarily.

Chinese Army Prepared: On the Chinese army's side in the three counties, they have received this information. Regardless of whether what the traitors said is just spreading rumors or whether the Japanese side has such intentions, they have already made the necessary preparations in terms of various deployments and communications. If the Japanese dare to take the risk of invading, they will be dealt a heavy blow. Moreover, the Eastern Theater Chinese army is very beneficial to the overall Eastern Theater war situation. Even if the Japanese army has no such intention, the Chinese army will definitely take the initiative to attack the Japanese army, implementing a containment and attrition war. Therefore, a major battle in Pudong is bound to be inevitable.

### Xu Xingzhou's Troops Control Shanghai-Minhang, Cut Off the Shanghai-Songjiang and Shanghai-Songjiang Highways, and Are Now Advancing Towards Southern Pudong

Xu Xingzhou, the commander of the 3rd Regiment of the Jiangsu Security Infantry, has been actively advancing towards the border of Shanghai County since being ordered to lead his troops to concentrate at designated locations. In the middle, he repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese and puppet troops, but still moved forward with courage. He has controlled the four suburbs of the county and the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, which the Japanese army considers to be its lifeline, cut off the Shanghai-Songjiang and Shanghai-Songjiang highways, making it impossible for the Japanese and puppet troops to move. At the same time, he is supporting friendly forces and advancing towards southern Pudong to attack the Japanese army from both sides.

### Inaccurate Content Reported by Japanese Newspapers, The Municipal Council Has Firmly Denied the Untrustworthy Alliance News Agency Report

The Mainland Daily reported that, regarding the Japanese report that the Municipal Council and the Shanghai Japanese authorities had agreed to take measures to prevent terrorists in the Public Concession, the reporter asked the Municipal Council about this last night (10th). The authorities denied the statement in the Japanese newspapers that the Japanese military police would not only set up offices in the Municipal Council's police stations, but also in all of its sub-stations.

According to the news released by the authorities, the agreement was reached on the 3rd of this month. The police authority and integrity of the Police Department are still maintained, but the full text of the agreement has not been released. On the evening of the agreement, the semi-official Japanese news agency, Alliance News Agency, sent a telegram to Japan, with a slightly different interpretation of the terms of the reconciliation. Most of the English and Japanese newspapers in Japan have published this report, and this newspaper has now received these newspapers, so the news of the Alliance News Agency has caused

Some speculation. According to the news, the agreement reached between the Japanese authorities and the Municipal Council regarding cooperation in maintaining order in the Public Concession is as follows: (1) Japanese military police will not only set up offices in the Municipal Council's police stations, but will also be established in all of its police stations. Plainclothes Japanese military police will be stationed at the office, collecting information on terrorists and taking responsibility on the streets.

Defense Duties (2) In order to prevent terrorists from entering the Public Concession, the Japanese military police will cooperate with the Municipal Council's police to inspect Chinese people and goods landing on the banks of the Huangpu River and the Suzhou River. The Municipal Council will also restrict the location and time of landing. (3) The Municipal Council will control traffic according to the Japanese side's request to facilitate the inspection of Chinese people's passes and personal belongings and will pay special attention to inspecting Chinese people entering and leaving the Public Concession and the French Concession. (4) The Municipal Council will

Set up a special department to discuss ways to facilitate cooperation between the Japanese side and the authorities of the Council. The head of the department will be appointed by a Japanese person. (5) In view of the fact that the Chinese police hired by the Council are not strong enough to control terrorists, the Japanese will take appropriate measures to guide the Chinese police. (6) The Japanese police will show newsreels to interrogate criminals and suspects arrested by the Japanese police and the Council's police. The reporter asked the Council about the points contained in the Japanese newspaper news. The answer was that the statement was completely inaccurate, but they did not add any other comments.

### Japanese Bombing of American Industries in Yichang Leads to American Protest

Continental News reports that yesterday (the 10th), reliable foreign sources revealed that the American Consul General in Hankou, Mr. Sling, has submitted a formal protest to the Japanese Consul General in Hankou regarding the Japanese aerial bombing of American industries in Yichang on the morning and afternoon of the 8th of this month. It is heard that the protest document stated that the American authorities, at the request of the Japanese side, had notified the Japanese side in detail last June regarding the location and markings of the bombed industries.

### Japanese Conspiracy to Control and Plunder: Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Production Utterly Devastated; Kidnapping of Silk Factories Everywhere to Extort Silkworm Cocoons at Low Prices; Silkworm Farmers Establish Small Silk Factories to Barely Stay Afloat

The silkworm and silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been actively promoted and improved by the government in recent years, resulting in a large increase in production, accounting for more than two-thirds of the country's total, and representing a major component of foreign trade. Since the outbreak of the war and the fall of the two provinces, the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been devastated. The Japanese side is also implementing economic aggression and conspiring to plunder and control, resulting in the utter destruction of the silk industry. The Modern News Agency reporter has investigated the details from various relevant parties, as follows:

Abundant Silkworm and Silk Production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang

Due to the suitable climate and fertile land in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which are conducive to the propagation of silkworms and mulberry trees, their production accounts for more than two-thirds of the country's total and occupies an important position in foreign trade. Since 1932, the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, in order to improve the silk industry and increase production, has carefully planned and established silk districts, ordered improved silkworm eggs from the United States, established silkworm breeding personnel training institutes, and organized large-scale silk factories, resulting in further progress in production. Every year, more than 3.5 million sheets of silkworm eggs can be produced, and more than one million piculs of raw silk can be exported, breaking previous production records and establishing a foundation in overseas markets.

Devastated After the Fall

Since the outbreak of the war of aggression against China and the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, silkworm and mulberry trees in various regions have been devastated. The Japanese army even forcibly removed mulberry seedlings, and the extent of the damage is still difficult to estimate. Subsequently, in order to conspire to plunder China's silkworm and silk industry, the Japanese side dispatched Mugi, Kubota Masashi, Sasaki Asahi, and others familiar with the situation in China to the silkworm production areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to conduct investigations. Furthermore, Suzuki Kakusaburo, a former employee of Mitsui & Co., colluded with the traitor Zhang Zizhen and others to organize the "Huiming Company" in Wuxi in the summer of last year, merging the original Hefeng, Zhengyi, Anyu, Fulun, Zhenyuan, and other silk factories, totaling more than 2,000 silk looms. The capital was set at 50 million yuan, with the Japanese Hoshi Chuyu as the manager and the traitor Zhang Zizhen as the assistant manager. The source of raw materials was obtained by forcibly plundering from the people in various regions, or by coercively purchasing at low prices. All silkworm cocoons were also plundered. As a result, the company made a huge profit of more than 2 million yuan by the end of last year, in just a few months, which was in fact the lifeblood of the silkworm farmers.

Huazhong Company's Conspiracy to Control

The "Huiming Company" was reorganized into the "Huazhong Silkworm and Silk Company" in August of last year and intensified its conspiracy of aggression, hoping to implement control of the silk industry in Central China. Various plans were formulated, and management was implemented for silkworm eggs, mulberry fields, etc. Starting from January of this year, the pseudo "Huazhong Company" submitted the following conditions to various fields: (1) The company may dispatch one Japanese manager to each field, stationed permanently in the field, to manage everything, with the salary borne by the seed field; (2) Silkworm eggs shall be distributed by the company and shall not be copied or distributed; (3) Silkworm eggs shall be purchased by the company; (4) Half of the seed money shall be paid upon completion of production, and the remainder shall be paid in full or discounted depending on the silkworm harvest; (5) The company has the right to modify the articles of association at any time. The above measures were repeatedly convened by the Japanese side to convene meetings of various seed production fields, but because the general field owners were well aware of the righteousness and motivated by patriotic indignation, they were unwilling to be slaughtered by them, so they refused to participate. Therefore, this conspiracy of the Japanese side has not yet been fully implemented.

Only Small Silk Factories Remain in the Inland

Under the heavy pressure of Japanese violence, the original large-scale silk factories in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been kidnapped. However, the Japanese side does not attach importance to small silk factories with ten or twenty looms. Therefore, the general silkworm and silk industry personnel and farmers have raised small amounts of capital to purchase several looms and set up small silk factories in various villages. Because the price of cocoons is low, they can still make a slight profit. Those with more capital have moved to the Shanghai Concession to set up factories and start work. According to the investigation by the Modern News Agency reporter, there are 37 silk factories in this city, including Yihe Silk Factory, Shanghai Silk Factory, and Tongren Silk Factory, with more than 6,000 silk looms in total. Currently, the overseas Chinese silk market price is 1,200 to 1,300 yuan per picul, so the business of each factory is still good. Since the establishment of the "Huazhong Company," the source of raw materials will likely become a problem in the future.

### Gunfire Heard Every Night in the Western District

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that, according to people from western Shanghai, a large number of residents in the Japanese-controlled area have fled into the Public Concession. Gunfire is heard almost every night in the western district, and the sounds have become more concentrated in recent nights. Even those accustomed to hearing gunfire and cannon fire feel uneasy in areas where guerrillas are active and the Japanese army is unable to control.

### After the Success of the £10 Million Loan, the Legal Tender Reserves Are Further Consolidated; Four Banks' Issuance of Cash Reserves Changed to Deposit in the UK and US, Determined to Stabilize Exchange Rates and Maintain Creditworthiness with All Efforts

After the success of China's legal tender policy, the government, in order to replenish legal tender reserves and stabilize exchange rates, established a £10 million loan with HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, with the issuance of cash reserves stored in the UK and the US. The issuance policy remains serious. The details are as follows:

Serious Legal Tender Issuance After the War

The legal tender policy had already seen success before the war, and its credibility has increased even after the war. The legal tender cash reserve has always been above 60%, while the guarantee reserve has been below 40%. All inspections have been in line with the legal ratio. The total amount of issuance was 1,639,098,000 yuan at the end of 1937, and increased to 1,726,998,000 yuan in June 1938. The rate of increase is not as fast as in the early days of the reform. From December 1935 to December 1936, the issuance increased by a total of 568,979,000 yuan. From December 1936 to December 1937, the issuance increased by a total of 379,136,000 yuan. This is sufficient proof of the prudence of legal tender issuance during the war, and also proof that the government has not resorted to paper money policy.

Preventing Legal Tender from Flowing into Occupied Areas

In order to prevent a large amount of legal tender from flowing into the occupied areas, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that all remittances from the inland to Shanghai should be paid in the form of draft notes, and all remittances from Shanghai to the inland should be paid in full in legal tender. Restrictions were also placed on the method of carrying legal tender to Shanghai. All ships passing through various customs offices to Shanghai were limited to 500 yuan. The remaining amount should be properly guaranteed, and upon arrival in Shanghai, the full amount should be transferred to the Central Bank of Shanghai as a current deposit. The principal and interest of domestic public bonds were changed to be paid in full in Chongqing, and Shanghai paid in six installments, with the aim of preventing a large amount of legal tender from flowing into Shanghai. As a result, the Japanese and puppet attempts to exchange legal tender for "fake banknotes" and "joint coupons" in order to obtain foreign exchange completely failed.

Cash Reserves Changed to Deposit in the UK and US

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired at the bank yesterday and learned that the cash reserves for the issuance of legal tender by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China have always been kept by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee and stored in the vaults of major domestic banks. After the war, the government has successively transported cash reserves, such as silver and gold, to the UK and the US, or entrusted them to be kept in custody, or exchanged them for foreign exchange and deposited them abroad. Now, in order to replenish the legal tender reserves, a £10 million loan has been established with HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. These funds are all deposited in London, England, and a capital operation committee has been organized. Therefore, the legal tender cash reserves will be further consolidated in the future, and the government will use all its efforts to stabilize foreign exchange and maintain creditworthiness.

The Future of Finance Feels More Stable

After the Ministry of Finance made every effort to stabilize the national finance after the war, funds flowed into the cities, and with the regulation of public and private financial institutions, funds became more abundant. Joint offices and discount committees of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China have been established in various places, so the national finance remains stable as usual. Since the success of the recent UK and US credit loans, China's international balance of payments has become more favorable, so the future of finance feels more stable. Seeing that their own reserves are sufficient, various banks have successively established branch offices or representative offices in the southwest and northwest to assist the government in developing and building the interior and shifting the center of finance to the interior. Therefore, funds in the interior have become more abundant, which is of great help to the development of production.

### Rumor That Dong Xianguang Suggested the Internal Migration of Jews; Spielmann Expresses Great Concern About the Telegram

Continental News reports that, according to the "Miller's Review Weekly" published today (the 11th), Spielmann, chairman of the Committee for German-Jewish Refugees in Shanghai, received a telegram from Dong Xianguang, Deputy Minister of Propaganda, who is currently in Chongqing, stating that he intends to submit a tentative suggestion to the central government to designate certain areas in the southwest and northwest of China for Jewish refugees to immigrate to, and asked for opinions from the Shanghai Jewish community on whether this suggestion should be submitted and whether it is appropriate to establish a semi-official agency to find work for technical personnel among the immigrants in China. The Refugee Committee expressed concern about this suggestion and is currently studying it from various aspects. However, Mr. Spielmann met with reporters and firmly denied receiving this telegram, but he expressed surprise and concern upon hearing the news.

### Catholic Progress Association Sends Congratulations to the Roman Pope; Mass Offered on the Morning of March 12th to Pray for the Lord

After the death of the Roman Catholic Pope Pius XI, the College of Cardinals elected Cardinal Secretary of State Pacelli as Pope, naming him Pius XII, implying the implementation of the policies of the previous Pope. Chinese Catholics were delighted to hear the good news. The new Pope is extraordinarily virtuous, learned, and capable, having served as Secretary of State for nine years, familiar with Catholic affairs in various countries, and is a famous diplomat. He has made great efforts to improve the status of Catholicism in China and promote the Catholic Progress Association, and loves China as much as the previous Pope. Therefore, Mr. Zhu Zhiyao and Mr. Lu Yingen of the Shanghai Catholic Progress Association sent a telegram to congratulate him on behalf of the Catholics the day before yesterday. They received a reply from the new Pope yesterday to thank them and bestow apostolic blessings. The association also decided to specially invite Father Xu Zongze, instructor, to hold a mass for the Lord at 7:30 this morning at the Sacred Heart Church on Avenue Joffre, to bestow health and longevity to the new Pope and increase his virtue.

### Shanghai Weather Will Turn Humid; Not an Abnormal Phenomenon; Warmer Weather Expected Next Month

Continental News reports that yesterday (the 10th), Father Ki of the Xujiahui Observatory forecast to the people of Shanghai that although the continuous rain and fog for the past nine days has made people feel slightly uncomfortable, there will be more humid weather in the future. Father Ki told reporters that rain and fog are not an abnormal phenomenon at this time of the season. The average rainfall record has not yet been broken. Warm southwestern air and cold Siberian air are each following their respective paths, coming to Shanghai from Sichuan, and are currently meeting over Central China, causing seasonal rain and fog. However, the weather situation is gradually moving northeastward, and by the beginning of April, Shanghai will have warm southwestern air. It is expected that there will be slight rain at that time. Yesterday late at night, it was still raining in Shanghai. Tomorrow, Sunday, it may be cloudy and rainy again. If the rain does not stop, it will be the fifth consecutive cloudy and rainy Sunday.

### Jianghai Customs Prepares to Add Six Tax Collection Offices; In the Two Concessions and Near the Four Suburbs

Since the resumption of operations on the 1st of this month at the five tax collection offices of Jianghai Customs at the North Railway Station, Beili'nan Road, Hongqiao Road, Daxi Road, and North Suzhou Road, progress has been smooth. A reporter inquired at Jianghai Customs yesterday and learned that, according to those in charge of the Customs, in order to make it difficult for all native goods exported from the Concession area or imported from the inland to evade taxes or smuggle in the future, it has been decided to prepare to add six tax collection offices at the main road ports near the borders of the two Concessions and the occupied areas. It is heard that there are six places: Maigeng Road, Mint, Xujiahui, Fanhangdu, South Railway Station, etc. The work is currently in progress, and it can be officially opened for business in early April.

### Route 9 Buses Add New Vehicles; New Vehicles Being Assembled; Congestion Will Be Avoided in the Future

The British Public Bus Company made a considerable profit last year due to passenger congestion. In view of the fact that even with four or five buses running continuously on each route, it is still impossible to accommodate passengers, the company has ordered more than 40 new military vehicles from the British Automobile Company. Currently, seven of these vehicles have arrived in Shanghai and are being assembled in the factory. Once completed, they will be added to Route 9 for operation. The remaining vehicles will also arrive in Shanghai and be assembled for operation in February. Therefore, the congestion problem of public buses in this city can be solved.

### Today, Various Organizations in Tonghai Commemorate Zhang Tuian; All Organizations Participate in the Yufosi Temple on Binlang Road

### Honolulu Medical Relief Society Continues to Donate Medical Expenses; 50,000 National Currency Remitted Yesterday; Admirable Enthusiasm for Our Disaster Victims

The Honolulu Medical Relief Society of the United States is an organization initiated and organized by enthusiastic people in the United States, dedicated to raising medical funds to assist in the relief of Chinese disasters. Since its establishment, it has repeatedly remitted huge sums of money to benefit the disaster victims in our country. The Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross on Henan Road in this city received another 50,000 national currency remitted by the association yesterday, with 30,000 yuan designated to be allocated to Dr. Lin of the Changsha Red Cross as medical expenses in Central China, 10,000 yuan to be allocated to Guangzhou, and another 10,000 yuan for general medical expenses. Their enthusiasm is truly admirable.

### The Thrift and Disaster Relief Association Advises Against Using Shark Fin; Why Bear to Spend the Most Expensive Price to Buy This Hard-to-Enjoy Food?

The Thrift and Disaster Relief Association issued an announcement yesterday, advising citizens not to use shark fin to entertain guests. The original text reads, "Shark fin is an item of high value, and it still needs chicken soup and ham to season it. Since the Chinese coast has been blockaded, this product has also been seized. We are living on an isolated island, seeking pleasure for our appetite. Why bear to spend the most expensive price to buy this hard-to-enjoy food? If shark fin is excluded from a banquet, then other dishes will be more delicious. The host's affection and the guests' pleasure will be more enjoyable, and there will be no guilt after being drunk and full. Wouldn't it be beautiful and good? Our association sincerely advises, adhering to the principle of thrift. If customers do not demand it, then the restaurants will not provide it. If restaurants do not provide it, then customers will be ashamed to demand it. Both sides should encourage each other and create a fashion. How can we hope for good fortune?"

### The Four Banks of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China Announce: Damaged Banknotes Will Be Exchanged as Much as Possible; Handled According to the Method of Exchanging Damaged Banknotes, and It is Hoped That the Holders of the Banknotes Will Exchange Directly with the Four Banks

After the Ministry of Finance approved the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's request to find a way to exchange damaged banknotes, it ordered the four banks of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China to comply. Now the four banks have jointly announced, "If the banknotes issued by our banks are damaged, please bring the banknotes directly to our banks for exchange during business hours. Our banks will exchange them at any time according to the method of exchanging damaged banknotes, depending on the extent of the damage. Please be informed." A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired at the four banks yesterday and learned that the report that the Broken Banknote Exchange Office had opened the other day was inaccurate. If there are broken banknotes from various banks, you can go directly to that office for exchange. That exchange office has nothing to do with the four banks and was not established by the four banks. It is obviously for profit by exchanging damaged banknotes. It is hoped that banknote holders will exchange directly with the four banks, and the exchange method will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee.

### Residents in the Concession Repeatedly Arrested; Four Guests at the Mengyuan Hotel Arrested; The Reason for the Arrest Is Unknown—Ma Zhujun Also Missing—

Since the unfortunate events that occurred continuously in this city, although the responsible police authorities have carried out strict searches and precautions in the Public Concession, which has reduced the incidents, there are still many people who have been groundlessly arrested under the pretext of terrorism in recent days. According to inquiries, at around 9:30 AM on the 7th, four travelers were arrested in rooms 238 and 325 of the Mengyuan Hotel at the intersection of Hebei Road and Hankou Road. Three of them were local, named Ma Sishan, Pu Shizhen, and Xu Shuxun. The other one, named Chen Zuoshan, is from Jiading. All of them are in the business world. The reason for their crimes is unknown, so their families are very worried and are inquiring and rescuing them.

### Money Changer Conspires to Kill for Money; Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; If Not Satisfied, Can Appeal Within Ten Days

Zhuang, the wife of Qian Wenbiao, a native of Ningbo and an employee of the British American Tobacco Company, who resides at No. 146 Dexing Lane, Wengjianshi Road (33 years old and a native of Songjiang), coveted the property of her 60-year-old adoptive mother, Zhuang Xu, which included several thousand taels of gold in bank deposits. On the afternoon of January 16, at around 8:00 PM, she took advantage of the opportunity to put ten pre-purchased Western medicine Diazepam sleeping pills into the cough medicine pot that Zhuang Xu was having her brew and drink. After Madam Zhuang drank it, she died of poisoning at 4:00 AM the next morning. Someone reported it to the Huishi Police Station in charge, and they dispatched detectives to arrest Zhuang Qian and escort her to the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, filed a public prosecution for the crime of murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law, stating that although Zhuang Qian was not the biological daughter of the deceased, she had been raised to this day, reaching 30 years, and was truly unconscionable, repaying kindness with vengeance, requesting the most severe punishment. After deliberation and debate, he awaited sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Changsheng came to the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Zhuang Qian to life imprisonment for murder, depriving her of civil rights for life. The medicine pot was detained in the warehouse, and he declared to Madam Zhuang, "Although the Municipal Council's chemist cannot verify what kind of poison is in the boiled cough medicine pot that has been soaked in clear water, you have admitted twice in court that you put ten Diazepam sleeping pills into the medicine pot to harm your adoptive mother. You cannot deny it. This court sentences you to death, but now I spare you from death and sentence you to life imprisonment. If you are not satisfied with the judgment, you can appeal within ten days."

### Impersonating School Teachers to Swindle Money from Students' Parents: Three Incidents Occurred in a Certain Girls' School in One Day; Parents of All Students are Urged to Take Strict Precautions

The residents of Shanghai are a mixed bag, and cases of fraud and abduction occur from time to time. On the 9th of this month, a certain girls' school in the city discovered someone impersonating a school teacher to swindle money from students' parents. The details of the incident are as follows: There were three female students, Gao, Zhu, and Huang, all studying at a certain girls' school and living near Haig Road. At 1:00 PM on the 9th, a

Young Woman, wearing a qipao and leather shoes, dressed quite fashionably, claiming to be surnamed Hu and a teacher at the girls' school, the teacher of their daughter, appeared at Gao's house looking anxious. She said to Gao's parents that her young son had suddenly fallen seriously ill and had been sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's diagnosis, he was instructed to be hospitalized and had to pay a deposit of 22 yuan for the room and medical expenses according to the regulations. Because she only had 14 yuan with her, she still owed 8 yuan. Because going home

Would be too far and time-consuming, she came nearby to ask for a temporary loan, promising to repay it that evening. Seeing that she was quite presentable and spoke fluently, and since she was their daughter's teacher, Gao's parents did not suspect anything and lent her 8 yuan. After obtaining these 8 yuan, this imposter went to Zhu's house nearby, intending to use the same trick. However, seeing that there were many people in the student's home,

Fearing exposure, she did not speak and left directly. She then went to Huang's house nearby and used the same story to earnestly request a loan. Huang's parents happened to be short on cash at the time, so they did not agree. They expressed their apologies to this Hu, and as it was raining heavily, Huang's parents felt sorry for her and offered to hire a car for her, but Hu declined and borrowed an umbrella before leaving. At 4:00 PM, after school was dismissed, the students returned home,

And after inquiring about the incident, they realized that it was someone impersonating a school teacher. However, the person had already left and could not be traced. The swindler managed to obtain 8 yuan in cash and an umbrella within an hour. Parents of students at all schools in the city are urged to pay close attention to this type of scam.

### The Education and Care of Refugee Children

— Yang Chunlu

With the current War of Resistance, countless young refugees have emerged. Their homes have been destroyed by the aggressors' artillery fire, and they have all become refugee children with no work to do and no books to read. Some are living in shelters, while others are wandering the streets and alleys, begging for a living.

Who would deny that children are the future masters of a country, and the nation and society have a responsibility to educate and care for them? How can these refugee children be abandoned outside the sphere of education and care? Especially in this era of resisting aggression and building the nation, they are the lifeline of the country, the future soldiers, and are of great importance to the nation, so we cannot ignore them.

Therefore, refugee children's schools have been established in various shelters. The China Child Education Society has also advocated the education of street children and has established many street children's schools. The Shanghai International Relief Committee has established a vocational education and care center for street children on Xiamen Road. The Shanghai Relief Refugee Children Education and Care Home is raising funds to build its own facilities to accommodate as many refugee children as possible. In addition to founding a newspaper boy school, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association is actively preparing to establish a beggar children's education and care home, which will soon be established. As for the education and care of refugee children, on the one hand, it is of course necessary to maintain their lives, but on the other hand, attention must be paid to education. Such education and care not only enable them to maintain their current lives, but also impart to them the necessary knowledge and skills for life, cultivate their national consciousness, and foster their spirit and ability to be self-reliant, so that they can become useful members of society in the future and contribute to the country.

Therefore, the following principles should be particularly noted in the education of refugee children:

1. Cultivate national consciousness: To enable them to have a deep understanding of the current national crisis and actively cultivate their unity, love for the motherland, and protection of the nation's survival.

2. Cultivate the spirit of self-reliance: Shelters and educational institutions must not be old folks' homes that bury their lives. Their dependence should be eradicated, and their spirit of independent creation and determination to serve society should be cultivated.

3. Cultivate a scientific mind: To impart the knowledge necessary for life, and to use this knowledge to analyze, understand, and solve various problems in life.

4. Cultivate the ability to produce: To guide them in productive skills in labor, to develop their skills as workers, and to provide them with a way out for future self-reliance.

5. Cultivate hygienic habits: Most refugee children are dirty, and the cultivation of hygienic habits is especially important. It must be guided at all times in daily life.

### Peace, Struggle, and Save China

— Lu Lishi

— Written to commemorate the "Sun Yat-sen Death Anniversary" in the 28th year [of the Republic]

The bells rang, and the children of all grades lined up and entered the auditorium in order. Above the auditorium door, a cypress archway with the words "The World is for All" was specially erected for the day. Several wreaths were placed on the stage, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere.

After the formalities were completed, Principal Li, in a tragic and solemn tone, reported the passing of Sun Yat-sen. The entire hall was silent. He said, "Today is March 12th, the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. Since advocating revolution, Sun Yat-sen truly never ceased thinking about revolution and doing revolutionary work. After the founding of the Republic of China, many warlords were dictatorial, and Sun Yat-sen continued to struggle, using many methods to overthrow the warlords and achieve peaceful unification.

In September of the 13th year of the Republic [1924], when the northern warlords were in fierce fighting, Sun Yat-sen believed that the opportunity to overthrow the warlords had come. He led his troops on the Northern Expedition. Later, Wu Peifu's officers defected, and the warlords disintegrated. Sun Yat-sen then went to the north alone to carry out the work of peaceful unification. He advocated convening a National Assembly to gather representatives from various groups to solve national affairs, and he gave speeches everywhere to make the people understand his proposals. However, he was too mentally exhausted, and when he arrived in Tianjin, he discovered the liver cancer that had resulted from overwork. Despite being treated by many famous doctors, it was not effective. Mr. Sun still traveled to Beijing with his illness and entered the Xiehe Hospital for radium treatment, but it was also ineffective. On the morning of March 11th, his mind suddenly became very clear. He summoned his wife, Soong Ching-ling, his son, Sun Ke, and Jingwei and others to his bedside, explaining that his proposals had not been realized and hoping that his comrades would work hard. He also ordered that the will prepared on the 24th of last month be presented, and he personally signed it with a fountain pen. Suddenly, he shouted 'Peace!' 'Struggle!' 'Save China!' one after another, more than forty times, before passing away at 10:30 AM on the 12th, at the age of sixty. The news of this unfortunate event shocked the hearts of people all over China and the world. Grand memorial services were held everywhere. On the day of the funeral in Beijing, there were 100,000 people sending him off, which shows the greatness and deeply moving nature of Sun Yat-sen's character. After Mr. Sun's death, his coffin was temporarily placed in the Biyun Temple in the Western Hills of Beiping. In the 18th year [of the Republic, 1929], his remains were moved south and enshrined in the mausoleum on Zijin Mountain in Nanjing, for later generations to pay their respects."

After Principal Li finished his report, Teacher Chen also spoke: "Children! Premier Sun shouted the slogan of Peace, Struggle, and Save China at his death. Let us look at the current situation in China. Our government is struggling arduously for the freedom of the nation. At this moment when we are commemorating the Premier on this isolated island [Shanghai], what kind of determination should we have to seek the true 'Peace' of our country?

After Teacher Chen finished speaking, the meeting was dismissed.

### Why Thermos Bottles Keep Things Warm

— Chang

Children: Did you know that boiling water or ice cream, when placed in a thermos bottle, can maintain their temperature? If it were a glass bottle, wouldn't the result be completely different? Because heat is always transferred through: (1) convection, (2) conduction, and (3) radiation. If these three can be avoided, then the temperature will naturally not change. Now, I will briefly describe each of these three aspects:

(1) Convection — Hot fluids rise, and cold fluids descend. This is called convection, which is the transfer of heat from one place to another by a hot body or a heated part of a fluid. Since the temperature inside a thermos bottle is the same throughout, there is no convective heat transfer, so the temperature does not change.

(2) Conduction — Conduction requires an intermediate medium, either solid or gas. Thermos bottles do not have a solid intermediate medium, which is obvious and does not need to be discussed. Regarding gases, I will add a little more: the glass of a thermos bottle is double-layered, with a vacuum in between. Even if heat passes through the glass layer, it cannot escape through the vacuum, which is one reason why the thermos bottle can maintain its temperature.

(3) Radiation — Many scientists have hypothesized that a weightless and elastic substance called ether permeates space. Light and heat rely on ether to propagate, which is called radiation. Radiant heat can pass through a vacuum because there is ether in the vacuum. So, why does the temperature in a thermos bottle remain unchanged? Because radiation is absorbed the least by light-colored, bright white objects, and the glass layers of thermos bottles are coated with extremely shiny mercury, so radiation does not easily escape. If you observe snow melting in sunlight, it melts very slowly. If you cover it with black smoke or black ash, the speed increases, which proves that the absorption of radiant heat by a material is greatly related to its color and brightness.

I have explained it simply above. Children, do you understand?

### Farewell, Hangzhou

— Bai Zheng

—Fifteenth of the "Ming'er's Travelogue"—

Ming'er and the others boarded the boat in the middle of the night, and they were all very tired. When they got on the boat, some of the timid people still had pounding hearts. Ming'er also felt this way. The boat was relatively spacious and had four berths. The Zhang and Li families had fewer people, so they each occupied one berth, while Ming'er's family occupied two berths. Ming'er's mother asked the boatman to put the luggage she didn't need in the hold and to keep the daily necessities close at hand, so they were busy for a while.

Although Ming'er's family had two berths, it was not enough space, so Ming'er and his father and brothers had to sleep on the deck. Mr. and Mrs. Zhang and Li let their wives sleep in the berths, while they and their sons squeezed onto the deck as well. So, more than a dozen people slept on such a small deck, which was obviously not enough. Fortunately, Mr. Zhang came up with a clever idea: each person inserted their feet between the bodies of the two people opposite them, which solved the problem of sleeping. "This is a trench," Mr. Zhang said to Ming'er with a chuckle, and then said to his father, "Do we want to make our blankets into a trench? It would be more comfortable, but we are not responsible for the foot odor." These words made them laugh. Ming'er felt that sleeping like sardines in a can was much more comfortable than on the small boat in the previous two days, because they could finally stretch out their heads and feet. As a result, Ming'er was fast asleep in less than a quarter of an hour.

Ming'er was sleeping soundly when he seemed to hear someone saying, "Qiantang River Railway Bridge..." He suddenly sat up and looked out of the cabin with tired eyes. It was just dawn, and the Qiantang River was shrouded in a hazy white mist, like a white veil covering the surface of the river. At this time, Ming'er gradually felt a little cold. Through the heavy fog, he saw a faint outline of a large iron bridge. His father praised, "This magnificent project is rare in China. Ming'er, I hope that you will be an engineer who can build such a great project in the future." Ming'er also admired the engineers who built the Qiantang River Bridge and hoped that he could make such a great contribution, but he didn't dare to say it out loud. Their boat gradually entered the bridge opening. At this time, the light inside the boat was dimmer than before, as if they were in a cave. After about two minutes, the boat gradually brightened, and the boat moved forward, gradually moving away from Hangzhou. The shadow of the bridge changed from clear to blurry, and a pang suddenly rose in Ming'er's heart, because he had long admired Hangzhou and now had such a good opportunity to miss it, so he prayed silently, "May the Qiantang River Bridge last forever, and may we be able to return to Hangzhou." In an instant, the shadow of the bridge disappeared.

The boat sailed very smoothly, and the people inside the boat were very busy because they had just gotten up, and more than thirty people had to do the work of getting up: hot water, towels, toothbrushes, they were all busy. Ming'er took a washbasin, drew some water from the river, washed his face on the bow of the boat, and breathed some fresh air. His father also came out to see the beautiful scenery. He pointed his finger at the pagoda and said, "Ming'er, look, that's the Liuhe Pagoda in Hangzhou. And if you look over there, the houses on the mountain are the Zhijiang University. You must have heard of it." Ming'er then said, "Yes, the environment of that school is extremely beautiful. With such an environment, how could one not make progress? Dad, I hope to go to that school in the future." His father said, "We'll talk about it when the time comes."

The Liuhe Pagoda in Hangzhou disappeared, and Ming'er muttered to himself, "Goodbye, Hangzhou. I wish you eternal peace."

### This Day Last Year

The Sadness of a Young Refugee

### Dreamer

— Zhixun

Dreams can also have a home. Children may question me when they see this title, "We have never heard of the term 'dreamer.' We only know scientists, educators..." But please be patient, children, and listen to me. The story of Edison hatching eggs was originally his dream of becoming a successful scientist.

The success of the radio was the result of Marconi's dream.

The convenience of using the telegraph today, who can deny that it is not the success of Morse's dream of a world transportation revolution? If Stephenson had not dreamed of inventing the automobile when he was a miner, would there be today's progress?

The realization of the submarine telegraph, if it were not for Field's dream, could there have been a connection between the two continents across the Atlantic Ocean!

There are too many such examples to mention.

Needless to say, humankind's liberation from baseness, its struggle for freedom from oppression, and its pursuit of a comfortable and happy life, we all have to thank our dreams!

Yes, all of today's successes are the sum of all the dreams of the past — the result of the realization of all the dreams of the past. Without dreams, mankind will never have progress.

However, dreams cannot escape the category of good and bad like other abilities. If someone misuses or abuses the power of dreams, they spend all their vitality on castles in the air that they cannot realize. This is undeniable. This kind of dreaming performance is just like a mad dog biting everywhere; the result of this kind of dreaming is just the decline of ability, collapsing due to inactivity. If I were to give an example of such dreamers, I think children would be able to guess it. It is truly like a microcosm of our strong neighbor.

We must not stop dreaming, but rather promote it! Conversely, even if we transfer our dreams to war, we must of course make our dreams of freedom, peace, national rejuvenation, and world security successful. Moreover, the realization of this great dream of ours is just around the corner.

Children, do you want to be a dreamer?

### Physics Q&A

— Chen Shan

(1)

Q: Why can a fountain pen automatically draw ink into it?

A: There is a rubber tube inside a fountain pen. When we flatten the tube, the air inside is squeezed out. When we let go, the rubber tube returns to its original shape, and the ink in the ink bottle is pressed into the tube by atmospheric pressure because of the reduced pressure inside the tube. Therefore, a fountain pen can automatically draw ink into it.

(2)

Q: Why can a circus performer somersault on a horse and still land on the horse?

A: A circus performer somersaults on a horse and still lands on the horse due to inertia. Because the person is sitting on the horse and moving with the horse. When he somersaults, his body continues to move due to inertia, and his forward speed is always the same as the horse's speed (not counting air resistance), so he can still land on the horse.

(3)

Q: If the tea is too hot, blowing on the cup will soon cool it down, or transferring the tea between two cups will also work. Why is this?

A: Blowing on the cup or transferring the tea between two cups can promote the evaporation of water. Evaporation absorbs heat, so it can cool the tea.

(4)

Q: Explain the types and functions of glasses?

A: There are three types of glasses: nearsighted glasses (made with concave lenses), farsighted glasses (made with convex lenses), and plano glasses (made with flat lenses). Glasses have two functions: one is to block dust, and the other is to correct vision.

(5)

Q: What materials are dry batteries made of? Where are the positive and negative electrodes?

A: Dry batteries are made by placing a carbon rod in the middle of a zinc cylinder, which is filled with manganese dioxide, ammonium chloride, zinc chloride, and a small amount of coke powder and graphite. Its positive electrode (carbon electrode) is in the center, and its negative electrode (zinc electrode) is on the side.

Children's Little Garden

### My Favorite Subject

— Xu Shaohua, Fifth Grade, Xinsheng Elementary School

I like all the subjects at school, but my favorite is civics. The reasons why I like it are nothing more than the following three:

(1) Because a person must know the principles of being a human being in order to stand in the world; to know the principles of being a human being, one must study civics books.

(2) Our people have always lacked public morality, knowing only selfishness and self-interest, disregarding the life and death of others, with a "I would rather betray the world than let the world betray me" mentality. If we want to improve this bad habit, we must also be familiar with civics books. Because there are theories in civics books such as "I am for everyone, and everyone is for me," "self-restraint and benevolence," and "the world is one family." When we elementary school students read them, we will have a deep impression, and we will not have the bad habit of selfishness and self-interest in the future.

(3) We elementary school students are the future masters of the country, but as masters, we must have a deep understanding of the meaning of the Party, etc., and a detailed understanding. To understand the meaning of the Party, etc., we must start with the revolution. Therefore, in order to consolidate our position as masters, we must study civics books.

### The Benefits of Diligence

— Shi Yuan, Sixth Grade, Fuxing Elementary School

Dear children, do you all know the saying "Diligence leads to success, play leads to nothing"? From this saying, we can know that diligence is the foundation of life. Like a farmer, if he does not diligently cultivate the field, then his future harvest will certainly not be abundant. If a worker does not diligently work, then his future works will certainly be of poor quality. If a businessman does not diligently work, then his business will not prosper in the future. From this, we can know how great the harm of not being diligent is. Children, if you do not diligently study at school, what will be the result in the future? In my opinion, you will certainly fail in your studies! Therefore, I hope with all my heart that you children will diligently study hard at school, and diligently do some light work at home. Not only will you have hope of success in your studies, but you will also be able to achieve the goal of "being a good man only by not relying on others."

### My Use of Sunday

— Ho Mei-ling, Sixth Grade Student of Yunzhong Elementary School

On Sundays, all institutions and schools are routinely closed. For students, Sunday seems like a day specifically for recreation. Therefore, on Saturdays, everyone is saying to each other, "Where are you going to play tomorrow?" "I'm going to the cinema to watch a movie." "No, tomorrow I'm definitely going to have a whole day of fun!" In reality, is Sunday exclusively for students to play? No, it's mainly used to rest our minds, because from Monday to Saturday, for six days, our brains are used for coursework, with no free time at all. Therefore, we use this time to let them rest for a while. But it's not like we don't use them at all. So, my use of Sunday is like this:

1.  Reviewing what has been taught – Why do we need to review what has been taught? Because we need to know what we have actually gained in school during these six days. Do I fully understand what the teacher taught? If there's anything I don't understand, remember to ask the teacher on Monday. Otherwise, if we know something and then forget it later, isn't that the same as not studying at all? So, we must review what has been taught.

2.  Preparing for what will be taught – On Sundays, we should also prepare for the lessons that we will be learning. Why? Because if you don't prepare and don't know the content or the details, the teacher will just keep talking, and you will be completely confused and feel like it's meaningless, and you won't be able to listen attentively. As a result, you won't understand anything. For example, if you don't prepare vocabulary when reading English, the teacher will keep talking, and you won't know what they are talking about. It's like feeling around blindly with your eyes closed. So, this is also an important thing to do.

These two things can definitely be completed in the morning. In the afternoon, I go for appropriate leisure or find some proper entertainment.

1.  In the afternoon, if I have the chance, I will gather a few classmates and go to the bookstores on Fuzhou Road to read books. If I find anything good or that suits my interests, I will buy it and take it home. Going to bookstores or libraries to read is a very good activity. If a student has a regular habit of going, it can not only provide leisure but also increase their knowledge and learning.

2.  If I don't go out, then I will play Ping-Pong with my brothers and sisters. Because it is also a harmless and proper form of leisure.

In addition, various normal entertainments such as playing chess are all things that I like to play.

### Snow White (10)

— Tian Sun

Before Snow White could finish speaking, seven cheerful voices simultaneously exclaimed, "Cooking? Did you say cooking?"

The princess proudly replied, "Yes, I can cook anything, even desserts. Apple dumplings, berry cakes, gooseberry buns!"

The seven dwarfs cheered in unison, "Gooseberry buns! Haha, how wonderful, how wonderful! She's decided to stay." Immediately, the seven dwarfs held hands and began to dance a simple and fun dance, like happy children dancing around a Christmas tree during Christmas.

Unexpectedly, the stubborn old one suddenly shook his hands, stepped aside, frowned, and looked at his happy companions, making a disgusted sound, "So, for a gooseberry bun, you are willing to take such a great risk, not even caring about your lives?"

His companions unanimously shouted, "Of course, of course! Don't you want to eat it? Those hot and delicious gooseberry buns!"

Hearing this, the stubborn old one seemed to see a picture of everyone devouring gooseberry buns, and his mouth unconsciously filled with saliva. But he still muttered, "Well, do as you please, but the result will definitely not be good. Regardless of the buns or no buns, she is still a woman! Once there is a woman, troubles will follow!"

But none of his companions listened to him, because the thought of the sweet and delicious gooseberry buns had already made them forget about being afraid of the queen.

Snow White hurriedly said, "Please forgive me, I must prepare dinner for you now." After speaking, she quickly ran downstairs to see if the soup she had been cooking was done.

Hearing that there was dinner to eat, the seven dwarfs followed her downstairs one by one. When Snow White lifted the pot lid, the aroma of the soup wafted into their noses. They rushed to the dining table, reaching for small spoons and waiting, looking very eager. When Snow White saw them eating, she secretly marveled at how greedy they looked, just like children.

The princess said softly, "Dinner is not completely ready yet. You have plenty of time to take a bath."

They seemed to have never heard such a thing before and asked in surprise, "Take a bath? Take a bath? Why? We don't want to go there, and it's not New Year's. Why should we take a bath?"

### Don't Forget to Pay Income Tax After Making Money

— Ba Dun

Due to the special environment and the surge in population, all industries on the isolated island have experienced abnormal prosperity. Last year, it could be said that every business made a lot of money. Among them, the yarn and flower industry had the most astonishing profits.

I have a relative who runs a yarn and flower business. Although the factory he opened was very small, with capital of only 200,000, he earned 350,000 last year, almost twice the capital. In addition, according to what I know, several yarn and flower factories distributed bonuses at the end of the year that amounted to 100 months' salary. For example, a small clerk with a monthly salary of 50 yuan received a bonus of 5,000 yuan at the end of the year. It seems unbelievable, but these are the actual circumstances.

Not only the yarn and flower industry is like this, but all other industries are the same. The only difference is the amount of profit. As a result, whether they are shareholders, bosses, or employees, everyone is beaming with joy. So, it's no wonder that this year's lunar New Year was decorated exceptionally lively. It is no wonder that what is overflowing on the isolated island is a scene of prosperity and peace.

It is naturally very normal to enjoy oneself after making money. However, while you are enjoying yourselves, I wonder if you remember that our motherland is waging a difficult struggle for freedom and survival?

Everyone knows that modern warfare is economic warfare. In other words, economic abundance can affect the outcome of the war. Germany's failure in the European War is a perfect example. Although our government's finances are stable and substantial, and we also have the enthusiastic assistance of friendly nations, based on the divine duty of "those with strength contributing strength and those with money contributing money" and to ensure the swift attainment of final victory, I cannot help but make an earnest appeal to all profitable manufacturers!

This does not mean that we hope all industries will donate all their profits to the government (it would certainly be best if they could), but they should not evade the national duty—income tax and wartime profits tax—but should pay them actively!

Many people have already raised this point before, and it seems unnecessary for me to repeat it. However, according to what I have learned from relevant sources, there are too few people paying income tax, so I earnestly raise it again!

Everyone knows that income tax is a good tax, and I don't need to say more. However, what must be mentioned is that in European and American countries, when it comes to wartime, they often increase the income tax rate to increase the income of the national treasury. And our government still maintains the original tax rate to this day. This shows how considerate the government is of the people's sentiments! So, if we make money and still evade this good tax, I ask, can you live up to the government? Can you live up to your own conscience?

I know that the merchants on the isolated island are very patriotic, as evidenced by the fact that a few months ago, when the post office stopped selling stamp tax, all trade associations went to the mainland to purchase them in order to affix them and maintain national tax revenue. This shows that my words are not blind compliments. Therefore, I earnestly hope that all industries will actively pay income tax and wartime profits tax after closing their accounts this year.

As for the report form and tax payment, they can be sent to the Shanghai office of the Central Bank on Albert Road.

(Followers enter) Reporting, Sir, I just heard from scouts that Han Shizhong is leading 30,000 troops to attack Jianzhou. They are not far from here, have set up camp, and are about to come! (Young man) Alas, wait! I think General Han's massive army pressing down is like Mount Tai crushing an egg. Fan Ruwei does not listen to my words and refuses to surrender. If I do not make plans for myself early, then at that time everything will be destroyed, wouldn't I be a fool to die under the blade, and leave behind the reputation of a traitor. What is to be done! Come, invite the lady! (Followers) Inviting the lady. (Exits) (Dan enters) What makes you so alarmed, my lord? (Young man) Alas, my lady, things are terrible! General Han Shizhong is leading 30,000 troops and will arrive soon. I think Fan Ruwei is no match for General Han. I have repeatedly advised Ruwei to surrender, but he refuses. If I surrender alone now, General Han will suspect me of treachery. Now that right and wrong are indistinguishable, what is to be done? (Dan) Has my lord forgotten? (Young man) I forgot. (Dan) When I first met you, my lord, I told you: if Ruwei does not listen to you, you should surrender to Yue Fei's army. You agreed, and you have often exhorted the brothers. Now is the time, why not take advantage of the army not yet arriving and sneak out of the city? If you are lucky enough to escape the city and can make contributions to the country, it would not be a waste of your seven-foot frame, and it would not be a waste of my marriage to you! (Sings) Your words are worth a thousand gold, I resolve to join Yue Fei's army. Take advantage of the chaos and military urgency, escape the net and run for a bright future. (Young man sings) Do not be angry, my lady, and listen to your husband's words. If I go to join the army alone, leaving my lady to suffer loneliness. When the government troops arrive, she will be bullied, how can I not shed tears! (Dan sings) Since I married you, I vow to be with you until the end, I am not afraid of the army killing into the city. If I am taken by the government troops, I would rather die under the blade than be unfaithful. If I can survive, I vow never to marry again! (Young man sings) Thank you for your firm loyalty, my death will also be with my eyes closed. If I make any progress here, I vow never to remarry to show my deep affection. My lady has given me all her kindness and righteousness, I can't bear to part with you! (Cries) (Dan sings) Do not weep, my lord, and be at ease about my affairs. The troops under General Han are all from the north, and I am also from the north. If our words match and we meet in a foreign land, how can there be no fellow feeling? Perhaps I will not die and will be able to see you again, to be intimate again under the flowers and moon! (Young man) My lady, even so, how can I bear to leave you? (Cries) (Moreover) My lord! (Sings) I entrust you with half of my mandarin duck mirror, each of us hiding half on our person. If there is a chance to meet again in the future, the broken mirror will be reunited and shine brightly. Take advantage of the fact that people are still unsettled, why not escape the city immediately? (Young man) Good, I'll go, I'll go, let's go! Alas! (With a crying voice) Let's go! (Looks at Dan) After thinking carefully, I still won't go! (Dan) You said you were going, why aren't you going again? (Young man) I can't bear to leave you! (Dan) Millions of lives all depend on your help. I am just one person, there are countless people in the country, for the country and for the family, which is more important, you should think twice. (Young man) There must be a plan that is satisfactory to both sides. (Dan) Good! (Makes a resolute gesture) You, a man, forget the hatred of the country, how can you be called a man! Enough! (Pulls out a sharp blade from her bosom) I will commit suicide to cut off your thoughts. (Young man snatches the knife) You don't have to do this, my lady, I'll go! (Dan steps forward to grab the knife) Are you going or not? (Young man) I'm going, I'm going! (Dan's angry expression turns into joy) That's more like it. (Young man) My lady! (Dan) My lord! (Wants to cry but holds back) (Young man) My lady! (Cries) (Dan) My lord! (Can't hold back, cries out loud, sings) Take care on the journey ahead, I will pray for your success day and night. After you kill the Jin soldiers and return, I will drink three cups to your heart's content! (Forcing a smile) Go! (Young man) Okay, I'll go. (Cuts and cries, feigning resolve) Be sure! (Exits, Dan covers her face and exits)

### Impressions of "Suez"

— Li Zhihua

20th Century Fox Production, Premiering at the Grand Theater

I will always remember Mr. Li Jianwu's words: "It is not easy to become a critic. At the very least, he must have the talent and knowledge to rival the author. And with something like drama, from the script to the stage to the audience, there is more than one author in the middle. To contend with a person versus a group of authors (if the author and the critic are really standing in opposition), it's really not easy."

What Mr. Li was talking about refers to drama. I think it is more appropriate to use it as a comment on movies. I quote it not because I want to evade responsibility, as if the writing of a bad movie review is a matter of course, no, not at all. I just want to use Mr. Li's words to explain that what I have always written is only "impressions after watching" rather than criticism. Of course, this is "blind men touching elephants," a "mechanized force." However, I think I should talk about the part that this blind man "touched." Perhaps there are audience members who "coincidentally" touched the same part as me and can use it to verify. Or, if other audience members touched different parts than me, I can let them know which part I touched. To be sure, falling into the eyes of experts who comprehensively grasp the overall situation, it is naturally strange and unpleasant. However, as a view from an audience member, it provides readers who want to watch the movie but haven't seen it a reference, and it gives those who have already watched it another verification. These kinds of post-viewing impressions cannot be considered completely superfluous.

For a film like "Suez," I can only be ashamed of my shortcomings. For example, regarding the history and geography of the Suez Canal, I know very little. And because of this, I am unable to explain whether the pioneer of Suez, Lesseps, was really the lover of a Spanish Countess and later had a confidante named Toni. However, I am an audience member who watched "Suez," and after watching it, of course, I have feelings. Having feelings, yet not knowing whether to advance or retreat, I still want to write it down, for no other reason than to provide those who have already watched it a verification (to see how much we differ) and to give those who have not watched it an additional reference.

In the film "Suez," the author treats Lesseps differently than the way they treat the "eternal" Pasteur who discovered microbes. The latter is to create a pictorial biography for him, while in "Suez," the author simply treats Lesseps as a character. His love affair on the screen may be true, but it is really like concocting a script that needs a love affair.

Speaking of the theme, yes, there is nothing bad to say about it, which is that a shrewd and capable person must experience great suffering and overcome great suffering in order to complete his career.

Indeed, the theme of "Suez" is not that simple. It also has, to some extent, the intention of creating a "separate biography" for Lesseps. Or, as the advertisement says, "What about leaning on green and snuggling up to red, affectionate? Who knows that death and separation are all in vain." It is almost like an American film, regretting that Mr. Lesseps' "death and separation are all in vain," and using this "tragic" theme to move the audience and satisfy the pocketbook. (To be continued)

### Rain Over Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Five: Spring Arrives, Bixiao's Fragrance Floats on a Snowy Sea, Flowers Fly in Tiger Hill, Moon Full in Li Lake

Zhu Airen said, "How do you know they won't be going back for a while?" Wu Junsu said, "How could I not know? Sister Danyun told me. If there is a chance, Sister Danyun will accompany them to West Lake to play. Because Uncle He's job here probably won't let him go back for a while." Zhu Airen said, "That's great, we can go to various places to play at any time. Although the scenery of Suzhou is not as good as Hangzhou, Hangzhou is all concentrated on West Lake, but Suzhou is scattered in all directions, and each season has its own places to play. For example, in early spring, we go to Xuanmu to see plum blossoms, and in February and March, everyone goes to Zhizhuo Mountain for a spring outing. In the summer, we hire boats to Lotus Pond, and in the autumn, we go to Tianping to see the red leaves. Not only that, but my father has recently added many places to play, but unfortunately I am busy with medical work, and there are many places I have never been to. It's funny to say, I've only been to Tiger Hill once." Wu Junsu said, "That's right! Speaking of Tiger Hill, the two sisters can go and see it. It represents a kind of urban scenery of our Suzhou. You say it's a city? This Seven Mile Shantang, with green mountains and clear waters, mixed trees and flowers, does have a bit of mountain forest scenery. You say it's a mountain forest? The shops up and down the pond are lined up, and it's also a lively market. I heard that Tiger Hill is close to the city, and it doesn't look like Mount Zhu, so it's called Qiu. A hundred years ago, that place was very lively, but not as prosperous as it is now. Recently, in order to preserve the old city appearance, Tiger Hill Shantang is not allowed to build overly tall Western-style buildings, nor are large factories allowed to be built there. Even the buildings and pavilions must be Chinese-style. There are also some painted boats and lighted boats along Shantang, adorning the scenery of a Chinese Venice, so Europeans and Americans who come here often take many landscape photos to go back." Zhu Airen said, "Okay! Let's go to eat now, where to go? Sister Junsu! You are more familiar than me, my father wants to ask you to guide us." Junsu said, "There are two famous restaurants here. One is called Zunlu Residence, and the other is Shijia Restaurant. Both of these places are good to eat." He Liyu said, "I saw the name of this Shijia Restaurant in a notebook, and there is also something called Suzhou's famous Bafei Soup! So Shijia Restaurant is here." Zhu Airen said, "Since Sister Liyu has heard of it for a long time, let's go to Shijia Restaurant." Wu Junsu said, "This is a branch of Shijia Restaurant, and its old store is still at the original site. Shijia Restaurant is indispensable on the shores of Shihu Lake, Liyu wants to eat! Fei soup, maybe there will be some in these few days." So the four of them got up from Xianyun Water Pavilion and went to Shijia Restaurant. (58)

### Isolated Island Drama Talk

— Ji

—About Huang Guiqiu's Supporting Roles

Huang Guiqiu's second performance at Tianchan invited Guan Shaohua, Du Fulong, Zhang Haichen, etc., all Northern actors, which gave the lineup a new look. However, Shaohua, Fulong, and others did not seem to be the best choices. (If Guiqiu's art of the old male role could invite Guan Dayuan or Xi Xiaobo, and the young male role could invite Gao Weilian or Chen Shengtai, there should be good results.) It is a pity that Guiqiu could not achieve the effect of green leaves setting off the peony.

Guan Shaohua is an amateur from the Beiping Public Leisure Gathering. He and Zhang Rennian, an amateur known for learning from Hou Xirui, are both employees of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. He went to sea as an actor three years ago. His art is not as good as Xi Xiaobo. Some say that Guan's art is based on Yan San (Jupeng), but after I listened to his singing, I can make an absolute judgment: Guan's singing has many Wang Shaolou components, and his recitation is similar to Ma Lianliang, without any Yan flavor at all. Guan's voice is acceptable, and his pitch is above six, but it is slightly to the left and has no standard pitch (that is, the quality of the voice and the pitch change at any time). In fact, his skills are still shallow. A few days ago, I watched him and Guiqiu perform Wujiapo and Dadengdian. His singing was quite skillful and pleasing to the ear. His body and stage steps failed to satisfy people. It is said that the Tianchan authorities originally intended to invite Chen Shaolin or Wang Wenyuan, but Chen and Wang were both far away in the Northeast. In desperation, Guan Shaohua was invited. In fact, the art of Chen and Wang is only slightly better than Guan. However, Chen and Wang's voices can be insured, and their acting seems to have a standard pitch, which is the so-called "non-wool origin after all."

Du Fulong is from Fuliancheng. He has been with Guiqiu for a long time and once followed Ma Lianliang. His art is mediocre, but his acting is quite decent. He has a solid foundation in both qualifications and experience. Although he is not as good as the rising stars Ye Shenglan and Gao Weilian, he is still a middle-class talent.

Zhang Haichen is the main painted face actor who came with Guiqiu to perform at Tianchan this time. He has never been seen in Pingjin. Perhaps he is a hero from the Northeast. His voice is quite strong, and his recitation has a bit of Hou Xirui flavor. That day, I watched him perform Tongtianxi. He actually had "a fragrant incense facing the sky" and "big top," which shows that Zhang's martial arts skills are quite solid. I initially thought that this person was a civil and martial arts rack painted face, but soon I saw in the Tianchan posters that Zhang's Caoxiao Pass play was a civil and martial arts rack painted face, and he also worked as a black head, which can be called civil and martial arts without blocking, and is absolutely rare. Therefore, in the current situation where there are few painted faces, Zhang Haichen is worth attracting the attention of audiences. However, Zhang's recitation has a lot of Shandong accent, which is a flaw.

As for Guiqiu himself, his voice is as sweet and bright as ever. His singing, recitation, acting, and expression can all be captivating. With Guiqiu's art, he is guaranteed to have a job in Shanghai, but the supporting roles must be paid attention to.

### Two Interesting Anecdotes About Xun Huisheng

— Master of the Plum Blossom Hall

Aunt - In the early summer of the eleventh year of the Republic [1922], Xun Huisheng, the master of Xiaoliuxiang Hall, was invited to come south. I, along with fellow writers Ni Ziqiao, Liu Gonglu, Shu Sheyu, and Liu Huogong, often visited his residence to chat and enjoy literary gatherings with wine, hardly a day passing without such an occasion. One day, Gonglu said to everyone present, "Life's gatherings and separations are impermanent. Why don't we take a photo together to commemorate this?" Sheyu said, "I suggest we take a photo in theatrical costume, capturing the essence of theatrical delight." Everyone agreed. So, it was decided that we would all meet at the Xin Xin Photo Studio on Nanjing Road the next day. When the time came, Ziqiao and Huogong couldn't make it due to other engagements. Thus, the four of us, including myself, took a group photo from the play "Spearing Mu the Dog King": Liuxiang played Mu Guiying; Gonglu played Yang Zongbao; Sheyu played Yang Yanzhao; and I played Mukua. After the photography was finished, Liuxiang laughed and said to me, "From now on, you will have to change how you address the master of our humble hall." I didn't understand what he meant and asked, "Change to what?" Liuxiang said, "From now on, I am your aunt. Are you still pretending to be clueless?" I said, "Okay, okay, I will address you as aunt." Gonglu said, "The aunt must give out a greeting gift; otherwise, it would be too cheap for the aunt." Everyone laughed heartily.

Nine Emperor Vegetarian Diet - One autumn, my sworn brother Xu Xiaolin and I represented the Gaoting Record Company to record music in Beijing. One day, Xun Huisheng was recording. He recorded four pieces: "Yutang Chun," "The Filial and Righteous Woman," "Mu the Dog King," and "Interrogating and Killing Tang." That day, Huisheng's voice was exceptionally good. The Erhuang opera reached above six and a half characters. After recording, Huisheng smiled and said to me, "These past few days, I've been eating the Nine Emperor Vegetarian Diet, so my voice is particularly good. This is your opportunity. In a few days, it will be worse." Hearing this, I was puzzled. I laughed and asked Huisheng, "What does eating vegetarian food have to do with your voice?" Huisheng said, "You silly man! Eating vegetarian food has nothing to do with your voice, but eating the Nine Emperor Vegetarian Diet has a lot to do with it!" I said, "After hearing these two sentences, I still don't understand. It's just like what Old Man Pan of Emerald Screen Mountain said: 'It's clearer if you don't say it; the more you explain, the more confusing it becomes.'" Huisheng said, "The Nine Emperor Vegetarian Festival (from the first to the ninth day of the ninth lunar month) is the most important taboo period for us in the acting world. During this taboo period, everything must be avoided, especially marital relations!" Only then did I suddenly understand and responded with a knowing smile. From then on, whenever Huisheng recorded, I would tease him by asking, "Have you been eating the Nine Emperor Vegetarian Diet?" Huisheng would always reply with, "Even if I don't want to, I have to." This question and answer became our secret code, the meaning of which was only known to those in the know, and the fun of it was precisely in the ignorance of outsiders.

### About Chaplin's "The Great Dictator"

— Danyun

Recently, Germany has been using various barbaric means to oppress Jewish people. At the same time, Chaplin has also announced that he will be filming a movie, tentatively titled "The Great Dictator." The screenplay is written by Chaplin himself, who also plays the main character, and it's entirely in sound. This is an unprecedented masterpiece for Chaplin. Chaplin himself plays two characters: one is a prisoner in a concentration camp, and the other is the dictator of a certain country. Chaplin himself is Jewish, so logically, it's obvious who the dictator he is referring to is. According to recent news from Hollywood, Chaplin is putting a lot of effort into filming this movie. He has his own studio, and the filming is taking place there. The actual work has already started.

According to Lives, the general manager of Chaplin's studio, officially announced, "Despite many rumors, the date for the start of filming this new movie has been set. In this film, Mr. Chaplin will not only maintain his usual style, but will also portray a character with a different personality. The Chaplin studio has expanded its facilities, added new equipment, and increased its staff to shoot this movie because there are many large crowd scenes. Negotiations are also underway to rent large tracts of land in San Fernando or other suitable locations for filming outdoor scenes."

In short, Chaplin is paying great attention to this movie. When it is released in the future, it will give the audience "a fresh experience."

### Fumin Theater Actually Appears

— Daizi

Using film art to anesthetize the Chinese people is a well-established plan within the Japanese policy of military aggression. We only need to see that after the fall of the Northeast Provinces, movie theaters were controlled by the Japanese, and the films shown were almost entirely supplied by Japanese film companies. These films were nothing more than those containing political messages such as "Japan-Manchukuo-China Friendship," "Japan-Manchukuo-China Economic Cooperation," and "Joint Anti-Communism," which insidiously anesthetized the Chinese people. After August 13th [the start of the Battle of Shanghai], the areas under occupation were subject to control or strict censorship of films. The intentions are obvious.

In Shanghai, Japan is adopting its consistent policy and preparing to open a movie theater in the Hongkou area. This news has been circulating for a while, but it has recently become concrete. The theater is named Fumin Theater, and it is being established by the Japanese in Hongkou. It is scheduled to officially open tomorrow (the 13th). This theater is the original site of the Guangdong Grand Theater, with only minor repairs to the interior.

On the opening day, Japanese singers will perform various songs and dances, and Japanese waitresses from Hongkou will sing in chorus. According to their circulated news, many ignorant Chinese people and Japanese residents will attend the opening ceremony that day. It is expected that there will be as many as a thousand people, with free admission, which is of course to attract a large number of vagrants.

The Fumin Theater is under the Fumin Film Company established by the Japanese. Therefore, the films shown in the theater in the future will mostly be those produced in China by the Fumin Company. In addition to films, there will sometimes be performances of songs, dances, dramas, and other entertainment. According to Japanese claims, many Chinese stage actors, singers, and dancers have contracts with the Fumin Theater and will soon perform on stage. Whether this is true remains to be seen! Even if it is true, it will be nothing more than recruiting some degenerates from the entertainment world.

### Postscript to the Lantern Festival Song Gathering

— Choucheng

Madam Xia Xunru, wife of Li Zuyu, along with Zhang Yuanhe, Wang Yijian, Ying Zhangli, Pan Nai Mao, and Pan Naiying, initiated a song gathering at the Lotte Hermitage during the Lantern Festival. They sang the complete "Palace of Eternal Life," with each guest taking on the role of Emperor Ming or Consort Yang. Starting from the scene of their courtship and continuing until the ballad, they sang more than a dozen scenes. Zhuang Yifu played Emperor Ming in the scene of the betrothal and bestowing of the box. This gentleman, who married Madam Wang Shuguang and Madam Wang Puzhen, wrote a legendary biography of ten years himself to record these events. He is known in the music circle for his romantic and suave style. He is well-versed in this opera. Paired with Xu Xiaoyin as Consort Yang and Feng Monong as the strongman, it was quite colorful. Both Xu and Feng are skilled in painting and calligraphy, talented and meticulous, proficient in all arts. Shen Shuying and Zheng Qicheng sang the "Wine Shop" scene together, one dignified and the other abruptly comical, both fitting the characters in the play. The "Floss Pavilion" scene was performed by Shen Hengyi as Emperor Ming and Madam Xiao Ming as Consort Yang. Both were veterans, evenly matched in skill. In the "Sudden Change and Burial of Jade" scene, Zhang Yingge played Consort Yang. He resembled Su Dongpo, with a full beard, but his voice was like a real Consort Yang, round and jade-like. This gentleman, who has long been nicknamed "Beauty Behind the Wall," gave an even more energetic performance that day. Everyone praised him as the "Bearded Consort Yang." When dying, he said to Chen Yuanli, "You do not direct your troops to the border enemies, but force me to kill myself." The resentment was palpable, and everyone was saddened. Gu Chuanjie's flute playing was even more commendable. Lotte Hermit and Zang Zibin sang the ballad together. The Hermit played Li Guinian and sang to the lines "Cannot finish singing of the ever-changing fortunes, cannot finish playing of the sad feelings and joys." The scene was so desolate and tragic that it was unbearable to listen to. Madam Xia Xunru and Miss Zhang Yuanhe sang the "Dish Washing" scene together, a perfect match, rare in the world. Entering the banquet hall at eight o'clock, the swapping of shoes was quite the fashion of the time.

### Entertainment Tidbits

The Kun female actors Han Suqiu and Han Sulan of the Xinji Grand Stage will leave the stage next month. The stage is looking for other actors to resist this. Zhang Baiyun, the deputy director of the 33-episode "Journey to the West" new play, has discussed the plot and technical issues of "Striking the Head to Kill Wannianchun" with Zhang Yipeng, the pillar of the stage.

Feng Zihe has been hired by the Fu Liancheng Opera School and Xiao Cuihua in the north to be a playwright. His female apprentice Zhang Zhuyan will also go with him to seek further studies.

The Method of Using the Body

(B) The Position of the Body

The positions of the body are infinitely varied and difficult to express in words. For example, when doing the same trick, no two people's body movements are exactly alike. However, the position of the movements of each part of the body can be summarized into the following four styles:

Parallel: The guest shoulder, guest arm, guest leg, and guest hip are all in front, or all in back.

Reverse: The guest shoulder and guest arm are in front, and the guest leg and guest hip are in back, or the guest shoulder and guest arm are in back, and the guest leg and guest hip are in front.

Forward: The guest leg is in front of the main foot's toes.

Backward: The guest leg is behind the main foot's heel.

The above-mentioned various forward and backward, parallel and reverse movements can be further transformed into the following four styles:

(A) Backward Parallel: The guest leg is behind the main foot's heel, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are also in back.

(B) Forward Parallel: The guest leg is in front of the main foot's toes, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are also in front.

(C) Backward Reverse: The guest leg is behind the main foot's heel, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are in front.

(D) Forward Reverse: The guest leg is in front of the main foot's toes, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are in back.

In the first style of outside edge forward, the main shoulder is in front, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are as far back as possible. The guest leg and guest hip are in back. The line of sight is directed towards the main shoulder and the direction of movement.

The figure below shows the first style, which is also backward parallel.

The four styles mentioned above are closely related to the four edges mentioned below. Each edge of each foot has the main posture of these four styles. There are four kinds of edges, namely outside edge forward, inside edge forward, outside edge backward, and inside edge backward. The position of each edge of the body also has four styles: forward parallel, forward reverse, backward parallel, and backward reverse. Therefore, the left and right feet together can be transformed into thirty-two styles, that is, each foot has sixteen styles. The sixteen styles of the right foot are shown in the figure. The left foot can be inferred by analogy.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (117)

— Xu Muyun

"Lianhuan Tao" is a group performance in martial arts drama

Among all martial arts dramas, the group performance of sheng, jing, and chou roles with the best structure, the most complete pairing, the tightest stage arrangement, and the best intention is the complete "Lianhuan Tao." This play is divided into five major sections: the first focuses on "Dou Erdun Stealing the Horse," the second focuses on "Tiao Tianba Going to the Capital," the third focuses on "Tianba Visiting the Mountain," the fourth focuses on "Zhu Guangzu Stealing the Hook," and the fifth focuses on "Martial Arts Competition on the Mountain," persuading Dou Erdun to offer the imperial horse and go to the capital to file a lawsuit, which marks the end of the play.

Although this play is considered to have a martial sheng role as the protagonist, the supporting jing and martial chou roles are also very important. For example, "Stealing the Imperial Horse" is entirely a jing role's play, "Stealing the Double Hooks" is entirely a chou role's play, and "Visiting the Mountain" is equally important for both sheng and jing roles. The final scene seems to have more speaking and performing for the open-faced "martial chou." With such an arrangement and distribution in the play, is it not that the person writing the play does not have a martial arts role, or is it? Actually, not, because the martial sheng does have very exciting singing, acting, expressions, and dialogue when paying respects to Peng Zhongtang at the "Imperial Audience." All these must be displayed at this time. If a martial sheng with no foundation plays the role of Tianba, not only will his immature legwork and clumsy body be revealed when running around the stage, but also his voice, breath, and pronunciation can reveal whether he has put in the effort to study and has been guided by famous people in the "Reporting the Gate" scene, where he speaks a series of more than twenty words. Those who are experienced in appreciating opera can tell from these two aspects whether he can perform satisfactorily in the following parts and whether he is qualified to be the protagonist of this play. Therefore, Yang Xiaolou's performance can indeed be called a unique masterpiece throughout history. First, he can fit the role of a lieutenant general, and he can also show that Tianba is a small leader among his followers. Therefore, Zhu Guangzu, He Lutong, Ji Quan, Guan Tai, Jin Dali, and other heroes on both land and water all wholeheartedly support him without wavering. Even if Tianba is sometimes impulsive and offensive in his language, once explained, the friendship will return to the original state, and there is no grudge between the two sides. A group like them can exist permanently in society. The so-called co-existence and co-prosperity, pushing up a leader, will bring glory to everyone.
