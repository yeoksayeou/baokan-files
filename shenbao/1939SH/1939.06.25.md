### Continuous Arrival of Chinese Reinforcements; Intense Battle Expected in Shantou; Wu Qihui Ordered to Take Command in Eastern Guangdong and Lead the Counter-Offensive; New Defensive Positions Established North of Anbu, Battles Ongoing; British Shipping Companies Ordered to Resume Hong Kong-Shantou Service

Chao'an: On the 23rd, the defending Chinese forces in Shantou engaged in a fierce battle with over 400 Japanese troops at Sijiewei, driving them back to the Chenhe New Village area. As of the evening of the 23rd, they were still in a stalemate in the suburbs of Shantou, with intense fighting. Additionally, over a hundred Japanese troops attempted to land at Baopu, west of Shantou, on the evening of the 22nd, but were immediately repelled by Chinese forces. Fresh Chinese reinforcements are now arriving continuously, boosting morale. An even more intense battle for Shantou city is expected. (24th Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Shaoguan dispatch: The authorities do not feel that the Japanese landing in Shantou is particularly serious. The Chinese defending forces, commanded by Hua Zhenzhong, Huang Tao, and others, are strong. At the same time, troops have been increased to defend the outskirts of Shantou and the Chao'an area. A major battle may occur in the future. There is currently fierce fighting fifteen li north of Shantou, where Japanese troops are attempting to advance along the Chao-Shan Railway, but are being fiercely attacked by Chinese forces. The railway has been destroyed, making it difficult for the Japanese to advance. Over a hundred Japanese plainclothes soldiers invading Anbu were annihilated by Chinese forces. The Chinese and Japanese armies are currently facing off at Meixi. Wu Qihui has been ordered to take command in eastern Guangdong, leading the counter-offensive and defending the territory. (24th Special Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Chinese forces withdrew from Anbu, northwest of Shantou, yesterday morning. New defensive positions have been established in the northwestern suburbs of Anbu, and fighting is ongoing. It is also said that after occupying Anbu, the Japanese attempted to advance northwest, but were met with a fierce counterattack by Chinese forces and retreated. (24th Associated Press Dispatch)

Chao'an: Frontline telephone dispatch: Most of the Japanese warships have left the Shantou sea, their intentions unknown. Only five Japanese warships remain anchored at Mayukou. In the Anbu area, there are still over thirty Japanese motorboats. In the Chaoyang Da'hao area, over two hundred Japanese reinforcements landed at 3:00 AM on the 23rd to harass the area. Chinese defending forces rose to meet them, engaging in a fierce battle for four hours. The Japanese made no progress. (24th Dispatch)

Chao'an: After Chinese forces recaptured Anbu on the evening of the 22nd, they continued to advance south on the morning of the 23rd. The Japanese troops retreated in disarray and did not dare to attack throughout the day, but occasionally fired artillery at the Chinese forces from across the river from Anbu to show their strength. The Japanese troops who attacked Meixi, southeast of Anbu, were fiercely attacked by Chinese forces and were also unsuccessful. (24th Dispatch)

Chao'an: After the Japanese troops attacking Meixi were defeated by Chinese forces on the 23rd, the remaining hundred or so Japanese troops were heavily surrounded by Chinese forces and were completely annihilated on the 24th. (24th Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) British shipping companies in Hong Kong have obeyed the navy authorities' notice and are dispatching ships to resume shipping services to Shantou. (24th Special Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) According to an official announcement today, the Japanese naval authorities in Shantou have recognized the right of British ships to enter Shantou port, effective from noon today. Mail, food, and passengers can now land in Shantou, but cargo cannot be unloaded. Since the ban on ships entering and leaving Shantou, there has been widespread anxiety in Hong Kong, presenting a serious situation, as most of the fresh, perishable food needed by Hong Kong comes from Shantou. Therefore, after the announcement of this decision, concerns about food in Hong Kong have been alleviated. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

(Chongqing) Chinese political figures here are still paying close attention to the situation in Shantou. Military figures claim that there was still fierce fighting near Shantou last night. They doubt whether the Japanese can hold the city, as the Japanese army, in view of the fierce Chinese counter-offensive, has already requested reinforcements. (24th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)

(Chongqing) Newspapers here have expressed great satisfaction that Britain and the United States have rejected Japan's request not to withdraw their ships and personnel from Shantou, considering this the first sign of a strong British Far East policy. Chongqing's only English-language newspaper, the "Hankou Herald," published an editorial yesterday, declaring that the Japanese occupation of Shantou has not diminished Chinese military strength in any way, as Shantou is not militarily important. Furthermore, China's transportation with foreign countries still has more than two routes. As for the Japanese explanation that the occupation of Shantou is necessary to blockade the South China coast, it is unbelievable. First, as mentioned above, Shantou is not militarily important. If the occupation of Shantou were indeed necessary to blockade the South China coast, the Japanese would have occupied it long ago. Why wait until today? What, then, is the purpose of the Japanese attack on Shantou at this time? In a word, it is nothing more than to show that "Japan has won another victory." (24th Meitong News Agency Dispatch)

(Chongqing) The Hankou English Chu Pao published an article yesterday, declaring that the only explanation for the Japanese landing in Shantou is that "Japanese soldiers, in view of the protracted stalemate in the war against China, are bound to cause dissatisfaction among the Japanese people, so they launched a new adventure to try to support the Japanese domestic war spirit." According to the report, this newspaper is the only English-language newspaper published in the rear of China. The views expressed often reflect the official Chinese opinion. The newspaper believes that the Japanese pretext for occupying Shantou to make the blockade of the Chinese coast effective is not sufficient, because according to this situation, the Japanese would have already occupied Shantou. It is the Japanese newspaper that publicly admits that the Japanese army lacks new vitality, and the Japanese military action will undoubtedly "end," but the ending will not be "pleasant" for the invaders.

### Anti-British Movement Spreads Throughout North China; Japanese Incite Anti-British Rallies; Efforts to Involve White Russians; Semenov's Arrival in Tianjin Sparks Speculation; British People in Tianjin Repeatedly Humiliated by Japanese Troops

(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources from Beiping, major cities in North China, such as Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang, held anti-British mass rallies yesterday. It is reported that this was to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the Guangzhou Incident of "1925, when a large number of Chinese students in Guangzhou were machine-gunned and killed by British troops." The mass rally in Beiping passed a resolution stating that "Britain is a disturber of China's peace and order," and that China will never achieve peace if Britain "does not change its pro-Chiang attitude and uses its concessions in North China as a base for activities that disturb peace and order." The resolution urged Britain to reconsider its attitude and "warned Britain that unless Britain clarifies its pro-Chiang attitude and agrees to cooperate with North China to build a new order in East Asia, the people of North China will continue their anti-British movement." It is reported that these resolutions have been distributed to all sectors in the form of leaflets. After the mass rally, demonstrators marched through the streets of Beiping. Furthermore, Japanese newspapers reported from Tianjin that anti-British disturbances were rampant, with demonstrators including sailors, stevedores, workers, inn servants, school teachers, and merchants. The 130,000 Muslims in Tianjin also participated in the anti-British movement. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

(Qingdao) The anti-British movement in North China has recently spread to Qingdao. Anti-British slogans have been plastered everywhere, including on buildings, the walls of the British Consulate, and shops. Chinese and White Russians are now being forced to participate in anti-British mass rallies and parades. Yesterday's mass rally even staged a parade in front of the British Consulate. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) According to the Admiralty last night, the British escort ship "Rossdorf" has been ordered from Tianjin to Beidaihe and Shanhaiguan to ensure the safety of British nationals in those areas. Furthermore, the British Consulate in Yantai requested the dispatch of a warship for protection, as anti-British demonstrations had occurred in the area and had endangered the lives and property of British people. (24th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Tianjin) Today is the eleventh day of the blockade of the concessions. Not only have the restrictions on food and personal movement not been relaxed, but the anti-British propaganda movement has become even more intense. Newspapers, radios, wireless telegraphs, leaflets, and other methods are being widely used as tools to spread the anti-British movement. The latest development in Tianjin is the Japanese attempt to involve the White Russians in this movement. The Japanese-sponsored Yong Pao published a report stating that 300 members of the White Russian volunteer team organized by the Anti-Communist Committee under Japanese protection would assemble armed in the First Special District on Sunday afternoon and march in a parade towards the British Concession. General Iglau, the commander of the team, is said to have ordered all members to be present at the time, and those who are prevented by their employers due to work reasons must resign immediately. The most important news in the Tianjin newspapers this morning was the Reuters report from London that British Foreign Secretary Halifax had met with Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu Kui specifically regarding the incident of the humiliation of British nationals in Tianjin. The general public expressed hope that the British will now take a firm stand. This news is exciting to the White Russian community in Tianjin. Since the Tianjin blockade of the concessions, the people most affected besides the British have been the White Russian expatriates. There are over 5,000 of these people, who fled from their home country, were expelled from Manchuria, and eventually came to Tianjin, where they were able to live in peace under the protection of the British Concession. If they lose this refuge again, they will have nowhere to live. Today, a pro-Japanese Chinese small newspaper in Tianjin published a message saying that all Chinese who sympathize with the new Chinese regime should withdraw from the concessions from now on. According to sources with access to information, the ratio of Chinese allowed to enter and leave the concessions by various search offices is four to one, meaning that four Chinese must leave the concessions before one Chinese is allowed to enter. Although this ratio may not be accurate, there is no doubt that it is easier for Chinese to leave the concessions than to enter. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

(Tianjin) Director-General of the Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council, Thibaut, told an Associated Press reporter today that the hope of direct local negotiations has now been abandoned, but he believes that there is still a possibility that the blockade issue can be resolved diplomatically. Thibaut also said that the Municipal Council has always adhered to its firmly established policy of strict neutrality, and the police cooperation requested by the Japanese has always been accepted by the British side of the concession. (24th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Tianjin) Today, the first incident occurred in which a British military officer was prevented from entering the Japanese Concession. Although the British military authorities are unwilling to make any confirmation, reliable sources told Reuters that this morning, a British military officer in uniform, driven by a British soldier in a military vehicle, arrived at the Asahi Street entrance and exit, wanting to enter the Japanese Concession, but was refused by the Japanese, who asked him to change to a rickshaw and be searched before being allowed to pass. The officer refused and immediately turned back. Mr. Davis, a British grocer and honorary agent for New Rylands, was embarrassed by the Japanese for the third time today, standing in the crowd, waiting for inspection in the hot sun for seventy minutes. It is reported that at half past twelve this afternoon, Mr. Davis and another British man, Mr. Whiteley, who is currently the secretary of the Tianjin Country Club, wanted to enter the First Special District from the end of the Racecourse Road. The Japanese ordered the two to stand behind a group of Chinese coolies, waiting for inspection, standing for seventy minutes before they were released. People of other nationalities were released directly without any delay. When the two walked to the inspection booth, the Japanese ordered them to enter separately. Mr. Davis was searched first, and his clothes were stripped off and thoroughly examined, even his mouth was inspected, and he was ordered to squat down to show that he was not carrying anything. While the search was in progress, people from several countries passed by, including a German woman who Mr. Davis knew well. Mr. Whiteley received the same treatment, but after the Japanese finished searching him, they threw his clothes outdoors and ordered him to put them on outside. Mr. Davis told a Reuters reporter today that he had a carpet factory in the First Special District that he had to supervise himself, so he had no choice but to enter the district. It is reported that Mr. Whiteley has lived in Tianjin for twenty-six years and went to the Country Club today to work. Although the British Concession has been blockaded, many foreigners have gone to the club in recent days to breathe fresh air. It is rumored that the famous Cossack leader General Semenov has arrived in Tianjin. Although this has not been confirmed by officials, it has come from a reliable source. Semenov played an important role in Admiral Kolchak's Siberian campaign. The admiral's activities in the Outer Baikal region were greatly restricted. He is currently the leader of the Far East White Russian Anti-Communist Movement sponsored by the Japanese. The White Russian community in Tianjin is united with him. Semenov's arrival in Tianjin has sparked much speculation, which is believed to be related to the tense situation in Tianjin. This proves that the Japanese are now trying to link the White Russian movement with the anti-British movement in North China. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### The Tianjin Incident and the United States

More than ten days have passed since the Tianjin Incident occurred, and Britain is still hesitant. The so-called "retaliation" and "strong confrontation" have, at least for now, only shown a posture of preparation. As time passes, the invaders' ferocity may not be contained at any time! However, in this dark sky, a ray of dawn is also revealed, that is, the attitude of the United States is gradually becoming clear.

In China, in the United States, and even in world opinion, it is believed that the actions of the United States have a decisive force on the Far East issue today. The Japanese side certainly has not been ignorant of this, so when the Tianjin Incident was launched, it quickly expressed its flattery, declaring special preferences for Americans. Of course, Japan's true intention is not to permanently favor the United States. Under the slogan of establishing a new order in East Asia, the interests of Europe and the United States in the Far East will be equally squeezed out anyway; Japan's current appeasement of the United States is only an attempt to ease the international atmosphere and alienate democratic countries. In short, Japan's inner fear of the United States cannot be concealed by any superficial articles of petty faith and petty favors, but is clearly seen by the Americans.

To be honest, the interests of the United States in Tianjin are not very significant. There are only about 400 American expatriates in the city, with assets of only 12 million yuan. Assuming that the United States is a country that only values ​​private interests, the United States may as well sit on the sidelines of the Tianjin Incident. Assuming that the United States sells out its interests in Tianjin for private gain, Japan is willing to compensate with additional benefits. Moreover, if the United States wants to be selfish, there are so-called isolationists at home who represent the interests of some capitalists to praise it; there are "quasi" spokespersons instructed by Japan to praise it. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has always used the existence of isolationists and quasi-spokespersons to constantly send autumn waves to the United States; currently, because the United States does not have major interests in Tianjin, it simply uses alienation to try to get the United States to leave the united front of democratic countries in the Far East.

However, Japan's attempt has apparently failed again. The United States' long-standing Open Door Policy in the Far East, which in the past blocked the conspiracy of division, has now become a bulwark against aggression and an iron rule to protect peace in the Far East and even the world. The United States has never been indifferent to the Far East issue. Why else would it have convened the Pacific Conference in 1921? Why else would it have loudly protested against Chinese aggression after the September 18th Incident? Originally, once the overall situation in the Far East is shaken, how can the Pacific situation be quiet? If the Pacific is not quiet, the United States will not only feel threatened for a while, but simply abandon its superior position and compete in production and sales with military equipment made with American wages against military equipment made with low Eastern wages. This is another point that the patriotic Americans can see clearly. Although the relationship between the Tianjin region and the United States is not very important, this incident is nothing more than a touchstone for the United States. "If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated?" If the interests of Tianjin can be abandoned, what about the interests of Shanghai? Even Guam, Yap, the Hawaiian Islands, the Philippine Islands, and other places, what about them? Therefore, Japan's small favors cannot shake the fundamental national policy of the United States. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the United States has always been prepared to take joint action with democratic countries, unwilling to launch alone. Therefore, when the Tianjin Incident first occurred, the United States could not take immediate action; however, the US government declared on the first day that its attitude towards the Far East event must be consistent with that of various democratic countries, which is tantamount to a solemn indication that it will not be confused. Sure enough, on the 21st of this month, the United States formally protested to Japan against the blockade and restrictions in Tianjin, and before protesting in Tianjin, it first filed strong protests regarding the bombing of American property and the opposition to the Gulangyu blockade, indicating that the United States' position on all Far East issues is consistent.

If the United States listens to Japan's seduction and adopts a wait-and-see attitude towards the Tianjin Incident, what rewards will it receive? American newspapers have already stated very clearly: "Since the Japanese blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the interests of Americans have also been hit. The Japanese intend to test the Western democratic countries' preparation and determination to oppose the New Order in East Asia; As for why the impact on the United States is the same as that on Britain and France? Because the position of the economic interests of all foreigners in China will take the result of this incident as a precedent." If the United States does not adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards the Tianjin Incident, what position should it take? US government personnel also have a very straightforward explanation: "After accidents continue to occur within China, the United States will have no choice but to choose one of the following two ways. In other words, if it does not completely withdraw from the Far East, it must stand up strongly and resist." This is the most important reason why the United States must participate in the Tianjin issue to speak out for justice.

The ambition of the aggressor is certainly not something that such speaking out for justice can contain; Since the United States can speak out for justice, it is certainly possible to launch further practical forces. Moreover, since the Tianjin issue occurred, Washington, London, and Paris have been in frequent contact, and since the United States can speak out, there must already be a kind of tacit understanding between the democratic countries. Therefore, how the Tianjin issue will develop in the future depends entirely on the extent to which the democratic countries tacitly understand each other and how practical forces are exerted. The United States has always been a good friend of China. Geographically, it is the two major countries facing each other in the east and west of the Pacific Ocean. Historically, there has been very little ill feeling between each other. It is said that the people of the two countries have very close contact due to missionary work, business, studying abroad, and other relationships, which has established a bond between the two countries. Since August 13th, the United States' assistance to China has not been small; However, the completion of the international united front against aggression in the Far East still depends on the United States to take the lead. Because only the United States has the least amount of constraints on the Far East issue and is most suitable to do this leading work. The Chinese people have always greatly admired the spirit of righteousness of the United States; And in addition to admiration, there is still an eager expectation. This is another point that the Americans know very well. This time, the United States' intervention in the Tianjin issue should not only be the dawn of the Tianjin issue itself, but also the starting point for the completion of the unified international front against aggression in the Far East.

### U.S. Values Rights and Interests in China; Will Defend Them With All Its Strength If Violated; Current Attitude Towards Japan Gradually Becoming Stronger; Actions of the Asiatic Fleet Highly Noteworthy

(Washington) The opinions currently given to government leaders by the American people have shown that the American people have adopted a more active attitude towards the Far East issue. As for the official attitude, it is believed that although the U.S. has no direct relationship with the Tianjin incident, the U.S. is extremely concerned about the larger disputes caused by the Japanese. They pointed out that the actions of the Japanese have stopped American commerce, thus involving the United States in the Tianjin issue. At the same time, the State Department has gradually explored a stronger position, rejecting all Japanese requests to expand the incident. However, officials will not immediately explore strong actions against the Japanese. In fact, the U.S. has expressed its willingness to act as a mediator in the Tianjin incident. As for the actions of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Washington observers are paying close attention to it. They believe that the actions of the fleet are sufficient to show the basic policy of the U.S. government. If the plans that have not yet been approved by the government are passed, they will inevitably affect Japan's foreign trade. Whether this plan will be adopted will depend on the tendency of the Japanese actions thereafter. A part of Congress advocates dealing with Japan with severe means, but the general isolationist figures still oppose this policy. (24th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Washington) According to Secretary of State Hull yesterday, U.S. representatives in Tianjin and Gulangyu are currently negotiating with the Japanese in order to transport a large amount of food into foreign concessions. It is said that according to a report from the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, there is a large amount of food stacked in the ships at Dagukou, waiting to be transported into the Tianjin concession for supply. However, the Japanese military authorities have repeatedly refused the ships to transport food into Tianjin. The observers here generally believe that this negotiation by the U.S. is another major move after the protest against Japan. The U.S. has included a list of the losses suffered by U.S. expatriates in Tianjin in the protest letter, urging the Japanese to pay attention. Also, the U.S. has protested to Japan because of the blockade of Gulangyu, but the Japanese have not only refused the request, but also said that the food in Xiamen is not enough to supply the needs of the Gulangyu concession. In fact, the food in Xiamen not only has a surplus of food to supply to the outside, but also the Chinese in that area are quite willing to transport food to Gulangyu, but it has not been realized due to the Japanese navy's additional restrictions.

(Kunming) French Ambassador Cosme flew to Yunnan by plane at 6:30 PM on the 24th. (24th Dispatch)

### Rogers Returns to Hong Kong From Chongqing

### British Foreign Policy: Cannot Be Directed by Other Countries - Chamberlain's Speech to the Public

(London) Today, when Prime Minister Chamberlain addressed an open-air demonstration in Cardiff, he touched upon the unacceptable insults and high-handed pressures exerted by Japanese soldiers against British nationals. He firmly stated that the British government's foreign policy would not be directed by other countries. The Prime Minister stated that the local dispute between Japan and us arose because several Chinese were accused of participating in an assassination attempt. The British and French concessions in Tianjin were subsequently blockaded, and Japanese soldiers exerted unacceptable pressures and intolerable insults on British nationals. This matter has been further complicated by public statements made by local Japanese officials. Japan is using this unfortunate incident as a pretext to make far-reaching demands that cannot be granted, seeking to change the policies that we and other governments have followed in these territories to date. As of now, the Japanese government has not made a formal request of this nature. If this case remains limited to the original dispute, there is still a possibility of resolving it through negotiation. The Prime Minister concluded by saying, "I feel obliged to add one more point: the British government's foreign policy must not be directed by other countries. Therefore, I firmly believe that it is right for us to expect that the Japanese government has no such intention." (Reuters, 24th)

(London) All newspapers have given prominent coverage, with large headlines, to the violence inflicted by Japanese sentries in Tianjin on Mr. Davis and six other Britons. The newspapers have given great importance to Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks yesterday regarding this intolerable insult. Although the Prime Minister later said that he did not believe it was yet time to take retaliatory measures, the newspapers expressed approval of the aforementioned remarks. Foreign affairs correspondents for the various newspapers praised Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax for clearly informing the Japanese Ambassador, Mamoru Shigemitsu, of the British government's sense of displeasure. The Daily Mail reported that there are a total of 15,000 Britons residing in China and Japan who could be harassed by the Japanese, while there are 50,000 Japanese residing in British Empire territories who are under British protection. The Washington correspondent of The Times claimed that the American government has fully demonstrated its tolerance for Japanese discrimination and countless acts of tyranny, but it is now showing signs that it can no longer endure this situation. (Reuters, 24th)

### Fierce Fighting in Luojian, Yuanqu

(Luoyang) After the Chinese army abandoned Yuanqu and Gaoluo, it has now made new deployments. According to a telephone call from the front line on the 23rd, there are now more than ten thousand Japanese troops along the Yuanqu-Luojian Road. On the 23rd, in Wang Mao and its northeast, as well as in the southwest of Gaoluo, a certain Chinese army fought fiercely all day long, with the situation intense. The Chinese army held the upper hand. On the 23rd, there was also a bloody battle in Malugou, north of Gaoluo. After a certain Chinese army annihilated the remaining Japanese troops on the Ma Jiamao east-west Puyu "Yanzhang Southeast" heights, the Japanese army reinforced with a large force and repeatedly fought over them, fighting more and more fiercely. The Japanese army also used a large amount of poison gas. One Chinese army has advanced towards a certain area and is now flanking the Japanese army. (24th dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Attack Dinghai, Chinese Troops Fight Courageously, Abandon the County Seat Due to Strategic Considerations, Retreat to the Second Line of Defense to Hold Firm

Jinhua, At 3:00 AM on the 23rd, at Dongyue Temple in Yancang, Dinghai (the largest island in the Zhoushan archipelago), there were more than 500 Japanese troops who, under the cover of five Japanese warships and many aircraft, forcibly landed and advanced towards the Chinese county seat of Dinghai. The Chinese defending army fought bravely, and fierce fighting broke out. At the same time, a large number of Japanese troops also landed at Shenjiamen. By the evening of the 23rd, due to strategic considerations, the Chinese voluntarily abandoned the county seat and held firm on the second line of defense. The fighting was still ongoing as of the morning of the 24th. (24th dispatch)

Jinhua, On the 24th, before and after noon, five Japanese warships sailed along the coast of Wen and Tai, launching small boats and patrolling the sea near Yanpan and Wushengyu, seizing more than 20 Chinese civilian boats, seemingly with intentions. The Chinese are stepping up their defenses. (24th dispatch)

### China and the Soviet Union Sign Trade Agreement, Signed in Moscow on the 16th of This Month, Including Reciprocal Trade and Navigation Terms

(Chongqing) The Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, have signed a trade agreement. The content of this agreement includes reciprocal terms for trade and navigation, as well as provisions regarding the legal status of the Soviet Union's commercial representative office in China. This agreement was signed by Sun Ke, the plenipotentiary special envoy of the National Government of the Republic of China, and Anastas Mikoyan, the Minister of Foreign Trade of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, in Moscow on June 16 of this year. (24th dispatch)

### British Nationals Mistreated in Tianjin, Britain Lodges Another Protest with Japan, Britain Will Be Forced to Make Important Decisions

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax held a meeting with Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu for twenty minutes this afternoon, during which he lodged another protest with the ambassador regarding the mistreatment of British nationals in Tianjin and inquired about Japan's intentions regarding the Tianjin issue. However, not only was Ambassador Shigemitsu unable to provide a clear explanation on this matter, but there was also no reliable information from Tokyo. Therefore, whether the Japanese government supports our claim to assist the Chinese people and wants to "generalize" the Tianjin incident, or whether it is willing to treat it as a local incident and find a way to resolve it, diplomatic circles here are still unable to understand. Generally speaking, the British government still intends to wait for some time before deciding on retaliation against Japan. However, according to people in Parliament, the government will wait for no more than a few days. If Japan is still unwilling to resolve the Tianjin case through diplomatic channels at that time, the government will be forced by public opinion to make an important decision, first abolishing the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911, and then further restricting the amount of Japanese goods imported and imposing special taxes on Japanese goods. (Havas, 23rd)

(London) British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu at the Foreign Office yesterday and lodged a serious protest against the "intolerable insults" inflicted by Japanese troops in Tianjin on British nationals. The Foreign Secretary also asked the Japanese Ambassador to submit the British protest (and warning) to the Tokyo authorities. During the conversation, Halifax listed the various facts of British nationals being insulted and issued a warning, saying that if Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin continue to be rude to foreigners, the crisis in the area will be even more difficult to resolve. It is said that Shigemitsu has agreed to forward the British protest to the Tokyo authorities and said that he could not answer regarding the solution to the Tianjin case as a local matter. After Shigemitsu bid farewell to the British Foreign Secretary, the London police authorities dispatched many additional patrol officers to guard the Japanese Ambassador's residence because there was a suspicious person in front of the residence, driving a car back and forth for a long time without leaving. According to the person, he was only testing the car's brakes and had no other intentions, so the patrol officers released him after a brief interrogation. Detectives from Scotland Yard left afterward, but many police officers remained around the Japanese Ambassador's residence, guarding and protecting it. It is said that the British Foreign Secretary had asked the Japanese Ambassador to clarify the situation in Tianjin, because the British are still unclear as to whether Japan is treating the Tianjin case as a local matter and can resolve everything locally, or whether, as the head of the Japanese troops in the area said, the blockade can only be lifted after the British authorities recognize the puppet regime in Beijing and stop aiding the Chongqing government. British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated the British government's position in the House of Commons yesterday, so the wording of the Foreign Secretary's protest must be very strong and without doubt.

### If War Breaks Out in the Far East, the British and French Joint Fleet Will Be Commanded by a British Naval Officer, with Singapore as the Base of Operations, Close Contact Maintained with the U.S. During Joint Defense Conference

(Singapore) It is heard that one of the most important resolutions agreed upon at the meeting held here by senior British and French military officials is that if war breaks out in the Far East, the British naval commander-in-chief will be the supreme commander of the British and French forces, with Singapore as the base of operations. It is heard that Siam's strategic relationship was also discussed, but Japan's recent efforts to court Siam have been noticed. It is believed that the mastermind of the conference is currently maintaining close contact with the United States. It is heard that the Japanese invasion of southern China, the occupation of Hainan Island and the Spratly Islands are currently under discussion, and the representatives are also paying attention to the urgency of protecting the oil fields in Borneo in the event of war in the Far East. (Reuters, 23rd)

(Paris) According to a French official telegram from Singapore, the Singapore military conference is now accelerating so that General Nobile can immediately return to China to deal with the emergency situation. It is heard that General Nobile's decision to return to China immediately was due to the worsening of the Tianjin, Gulangyu, and Shantou incidents. Also, yesterday, the Singapore conference decided that Britain and France do not need to increase their naval strength in the Far East for the time being. It is said that they believe that the current British and French navies in the Far East are sufficient to deal with the Japanese side, and after an incident occurs, Britain and France can immediately transfer the navy to China from the Mediterranean. (Associated Press, 24th)

The Hague, Rumors that the Netherlands will send representatives to Singapore to participate in the conference of British and French Far East army and navy authorities have been denied by both government officials, who believe that if the government were to do this, it would contradict the country's policy of neutrality. It can be seen that all kinds of rumors are definitely not true. (Havas, 24th)

(London) According to news received here, on the second day of the meeting in Singapore between the Far East military commanders of Britain and France, it was decided to implement a system of British and French warships patrolling the territorial waters of the Far East.

### Siam Requests Britain and France to Grant Aid and Guarantees

(London) According to today's "Daily Express" political defender, the Siamese government has formally requested that Britain and France grant the country aid and guarantees. Britain and France are currently considering this request. According to news from Singapore this morning, the Siamese government has indicated to the British and French Far East military conference that if a new conflict occurs in the Far East, Siam is willing to strictly maintain neutrality. The most noteworthy news in today's "Daily Express" is that Siamese observers at the British and French Far East military conference, representing the Siamese government, expressed their willingness to allow Britain and France to use Siamese air force bases. The newspaper continued that Britain intends to include Siam in the Far East strategic outline, because once a war breaks out in the Far East, Singapore and the Malay Archipelago are at risk of being cut off from contact, unless Siam joins the Far East strategic outline and becomes the hinterland of Britain's Far East defense line, the safety of Singapore and the Malay Archipelago can be guaranteed. "The Daily Telegraph" reported that the Dutch East Indies authorities are also paying close attention to the Singapore military conference and have sent officials to Singapore to informally exchange views with the British and French military authorities at the conference.

The three men explained the reason for submitting the petition directly to the Emperor, saying that otherwise there is no other way to get public opinion across. (Haitong, 24th)

(Moscow) Japanese sources have reported that fierce battles have taken place between Japan and the Soviet Union in the airspace over "Manchukuo."

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax will remain in London at the end of this week to closely monitor the development of the Far East situation and the negotiations on the British-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. Regarding the latter, responsible officials here have recently announced that after the Soviet government submitted an answer to Britain and France, the British government formulated a new suggestion yesterday and sent it to Ambassador Seeds in the Soviet Union. It is expected that the views of Britain and the Soviet Union will be greatly closer when the representatives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union meet in Moscow to make a decision. It is said that the content of this suggestion advocates that (1) if one of the three signatory countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, or one of the European countries that each country wants to guarantee, is directly attacked, the mutual assistance measures should be automatically implemented without prior consultation procedures; (2) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should sign an annex to the mutual assistance agreement, guaranteeing the names of the European countries whose territorial integrity is considered by one of the signatory countries to be of vital importance to its survival, in other words, clearly pointing out the names of Finland, Latvia, and Estonia, in order to comply with the Soviet Union's demands.

### Goebbels' Speech, Germany Needs Colonies, Self-Reliance and National Strength Are Now Different From the Past, Determined to Strive for Interests Vital to Survival

(Berlin) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, following his speech in the city of Danzig, delivered an important speech yesterday to more than 20,000 workers of the Berlin Transport Company, elaborating on Germany's current policies. His remarks were roughly as follows: "If it is said that countries pursuing imperialism harbor the ambition to conquer the world, then the policies pursued by Germany have no such intention. If it is said that pursuing imperialism lies in seeking the needs vital to the survival of a nation, then Germany is truly an imperialist. Germans firmly believe that the position we occupy does not meet the requirements that we should rightfully deserve. Germans do not want to continue to live under the sanctions of the Treaty of Versailles. Since the accession to power of the leader Hitler, Germany's national strength has been increasing day by day, and its military strength ranks first in the world. German engineers and workers have completed a wall of steel in the west," and one day they will reap the rewards of years of hard work. "Today we still demand colonies, not because Germany wants to become a rich country, but for the German people. We live in this space, which is severely restricted, without natural resources, raw materials, gold, silver, and other countries all possess such resources, so we should announce this situation to all countries. Today, countries around the world should be able to understand Germany's peaceful demands, which are also the demands of our entire nation. If countries cannot understand this demand, then Germany will closely consider the needs that are indispensable to its survival. All our workers should abide by the policy principles of the National Socialist Party. It must be known that the policies pursued by the leader Hitler are all based on the interests of our entire nation." (Haitong, 24th)

(Berlin) A spokesman for the German government, referring to the proposal made today by South African Defense Minister Biro to compensate Germany for the losses it suffered in Southwest Africa and Tanganyika, said that compensating for losses is not a problem. What Germany is asking for is the return of its original colonies. Germany will only be willing to discuss the redistribution of colonies with other countries after they are returned. However, Britain and France must include all their colonies in the redistribution, otherwise there is no redistribution to speak of. (Reuters, 24th)

### Germany Builds Strong Forts in East Prussia, Stretching Along the Polish Border Continuously, German Commissioner Inspects Danzig

The content is that from Memel to Marienburg, there are continuous strong forts built facing the Polish border. Similar strong defensive works have also been built in the Heilsberg triangle. These defensive works are, in principle, the same as those on the western border, paying attention to the protection of Königsberg. "The Hamburg Daily" reported that if Poland dares to attack East Prussia under the pretext of maintaining the status quo in Danzig, then these defensive works are a weapon to resist Warsaw. (Reuters, 24th)

Danzig, The German government commissioner March, who is currently inspecting East Prussia, will arrive here this afternoon to inspect the port of Danzig and visit the city's scenery. (Haitong, 24th)

### U.S. Treasury Department Plans to Extend the Deadline for Limited-Price Silver Purchases

(Washington) According to Democratic Senator McCarran today, the Treasury Department has offered to extend the deadline for purchasing domestically produced silver at the current price of 64.64 cents per ounce by six months. This offer was made to the senators of the so-called "Silver Group," who are now engaged in delaying the establishment of important legislation in an attempt to raise the price of silver. McCarran made this statement after Senate leaders and the White House met with President Roosevelt to discuss a new program of prime lending of 3,860,000,000 yuan. (Reuters, 23rd)

### British Authorities Plan to Form a Women's Land Army

Prepared for farming in wartime

(London) The local authorities will gather women from all over the country to form a women's land army so that they can replace men in farming after the outbreak of war. According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, farm work is extremely important during wartime. These women can not only replace men's work, but also increase agricultural output during wartime. The organization of this women's land army is similar to the women's land army during the Great War, and it is directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture's women's organization. In addition, the women's land army is of a mobile nature, including women who are already engaged in farming. They all wear military uniforms and are managed by a special organization. (Associated Press, 24th)

### Britain and the United States Establish Agreement to Exchange Military Raw Materials, American Cotton for British Rubber, Large-Scale Storage to Prevent War

(London) A barter agreement between Britain and the United States was signed here by Secretary of Commerce Stanley and U.S. Ambassador Kennedy. The content stipulates that the United States will exchange American cotton for rubber produced in British territories. Afterward, Commercial Secretary Stanley stated in the House of Commons that Britain and the United States would store cotton and rubber for wartime use only. In addition, it is reported that Britain and the United States will sign another agreement, exchanging British wheat for tin produced in British territories. (Havas, 23rd)

(London) The Anglo-American barter agreement signed today by the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, and the British Secretary of Commerce, Stanley, stipulates that the United States will supply the British government with 600,000 bales of cotton of the types designated, and the price will be determined based on the average price from January 1, 1939, to the present, with a total value not exceeding £6 million. The British government will supply the United States with rubber of equal value to the American cotton, with a total amount not exceeding 80,000 tons. The purpose of this agreement is to enable the two governments to cooperate in storing important items to prevent possible war. Britain wants to store cotton, and the United States wants to store rubber. The storage of these items is solely for the purpose of preventing war and will not be transferred for commercial use. The first clause of the agreement stipulates that in the absence of war, these items must be stored for at least seven years. When they need to be cleared, the two governments are responsible for consulting each other and making every effort to avoid disturbing the market. (Reuters, 23rd)

### British Prime Minister Reaffirms Diplomatic Strategy: Aiming to Establish Peace, Hoping for Early Restoration of International Confidence, Determined to Resist Any Aggressive Attempts

Cardiff, England: Prime Minister Chamberlain recently attended a Conservative Party meeting here and delivered an important speech. He first expressed his respects to the King and Queen, saying that the King and Queen received a warm welcome during their tour of the Americas. "This matter is of great benefit to the unity of the British Empire and the friendship between the British and American peoples. To this day, the unity of the Empire is more important than ever, and it is gratifying that the King and Queen inspected Canada this year. Some accuse Britain of being one of the 'rich countries,' deliberately making things difficult for 'poor countries,' which is completely unfounded. The reason is that Britain has not exploited its colonies to benefit its own country. On the contrary, it regards itself as a trustee, intending to assist culturally backward races, so as to improve their living conditions and govern themselves without our assistance. This principle is gradually being implemented, because all members of the British Empire adhere to the ideals of freedom and independence, and the strength of their union always aims to establish peace and maintain peace. This is known throughout the world. For this reason, the British Empire can be said to be a pillar of peace. As far as the relationship between Britain and Germany is concerned, what I regret most is that the future of Europe is now being destroyed by unfounded suspicion and false propaganda. For example, the German people are indeed uneasy, saying that Britain is implementing an encirclement policy against them, or that Germany's natural and reasonable development in commerce is now being contained by other countries, and is encountering economic oppression, so that their living standards are gradually declining, until they are destroyed. All these rumors are endless. It is lamentable that our country's attitude is being misinterpreted in this way. In fact, our country's foreign policy has always been consistent. In short, what our country seeks is to establish world peace, so that all nations can live and work in peace. In this world, if countries can restore mutual confidence, Britain and Germany will also be able to cooperate with each other to develop inexhaustible resources. However, if Germany cannot abandon its unfair suspicions of other countries and is unwilling to openly discuss with rational nations, then this happy future is just a pipe dream."

Then the Prime Minister touched on the situation in the Far East (see page 4) and explained that Britain's military strength today is not only very different from what it was a year ago, but is also expanding day by day, so no matter what happens in the future, it can be dealt with calmly and without fear. As for "our country's navy is invincible in the world, and although it is not convenient to tell you how many aircraft our air force has, I dare to say that the rapid development of the air force in the past year has exceeded the expectations of ordinary people. The combat effectiveness of the air force officers and soldiers and the speed and power of the aircraft are beyond the reach of other countries. As for our country's methods of protecting civilians, progress is very rapid, and the organization is complete and detailed. In short, although our country's military preparations are not intended to threaten other countries, we will definitely resist any aggressive or controlling attempts. Our country's mutual assistance agreements with various related countries have this as their sole objective. In other words, our country will naturally protect the independence of all countries that are fearful of the fate suffered by other countries. Thinking of this, what I want to reiterate is that changing the status quo is only possible through discussion and cooperation. If you want to achieve your goals by force, then we will definitely resist it. I hope that all nations who seek peace can adopt a firm will and a calm attitude, so that they can achieve their wishes." (24th dispatch from Havas)

### France and Turkey Sign Mutual Assistance Declaration: Ensuring the Safety of the Eastern Mediterranean; The Cession of the Sanjak Region to Turkey is Also Resolved; It Can Be Predicted That Friendly Relations Between the Two Countries Will Be Further Enhanced

(Paris) The French-Turkish mutual assistance declaration was signed by French Foreign Minister Bonnet and Turkish Ambassador Suad at 6:30 PM today. The content includes the following points:

(1) For the sake of ensuring security, France and Turkey will conclude a formal agreement, stipulating mutual obligations. Before the conclusion of this agreement, if an act of aggression occurs that causes a war in the Mediterranean, both parties will be prepared to cooperate fully and assist each other to the extent possible. (2) The two governments recognize the necessity of building security in the Balkan Peninsula and are conducting negotiations with related countries to expedite its completion. (3) This mutual assistance declaration is not directed against any other country. Its sole purpose is to guarantee that France and Turkey will assist each other when necessary. (4) Before the conclusion of a formal mutual assistance agreement, both parties should conduct a thorough study of their mutual obligations. (5) After signing this declaration, France and Turkey may still freely conclude various agreements with other countries for the general interests of peace.

Foreign Minister Bonnet made a statement, explaining the importance of this declaration, saying that its content is the same as the British-Turkish mutual assistance declaration of May 12. The three countries of Britain, France, and Turkey therefore have the same obligations to each other, which will definitely help peace and is sufficient to prove that the friendly relations between France and Turkey are seamless, which is very gratifying. Turkish Ambassador Suad also expressed his joy. (23rd dispatch from Havas)

Ankara, Turkey: Regarding the issue of incorporating the Sanjak region (French mandate) of the Syrian Republic into Turkish territory, the French-Turkish agreement was signed by Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and French Ambassador Massigli at 1:10 PM today. This issue is completely resolved. The French troops stationed in the area will be completely withdrawn by July 22. (23rd dispatch from Havas)

(Paris) Regarding the issue of incorporating the Sanjak region of the Syrian Republic into Turkish territory, France and Turkey have signed an agreement in the Turkish capital. The terms have not yet been published, but responsible sources claim that the main points of the agreement are four:

(1) France, within the scope of its rights, agrees to cede the Sanjak region to Turkey. (2) Turkey recognizes that the current boundaries of the Syrian Republic are immutable and that any measures that could endanger the territorial integrity and internal security of the Syrian Republic should be avoided. Residents of the Sanjak region who do not wish to obtain Turkish nationality may sell all their property and leave the area within six months. (3) The Küpeli Akra highlands in the Sanjak region still belong to Syria.

Diplomatic figures here recently declared that from now on, there will be no more barriers between France and Turkey. It can be predicted that the friendly relations between the two countries will be further enhanced. In addition, Foreign Minister Bonnet, on behalf of the government, issued a declaration, stating that France does not intend to abandon its mission in the Syrian and Lebanese Republics during the current mandate period and allow third countries to obtain convenience. (23rd dispatch from Havas)

### Democratic Countries Express Joy, While Germany and Italy Are Quite Indignant

Paris: The mutual assistance declaration signed between France and Turkey has recently been commented on by diplomatic figures. Turkey's current policy, although seeking harmony with the Soviet Union, does not follow the Soviet Union's lead, which can be seen from this. Members of Congress also said that Britain and France are eager for the Soviet Union to join the international security mechanism as soon as possible. At this time, Turkey has stated its position before the Soviet Union joins, so the position of Britain and France when negotiating with the Soviet Union can be strengthened. In addition, France delayed signing a mutual assistance declaration with Turkey because the Sanjak region had not been resolved. Germany took the opportunity to urge Turkey to change its policy, but it did not get its wish. At this time, Turkey is also conspiring to get closer to Egypt, and Egypt is also planning to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with Greece and conclude commercial agreements with Yugoslavia and Romania, which can also allow the Balkan Entente countries to obtain external assistance. (23rd dispatch from Havas)

London: Although the signing of the French-Turkish mutual assistance declaration was expected, political figures here were still very happy to hear about it, believing that it was enough to supplement the British-Turkish mutual assistance declaration, thereby ensuring the safety of the eastern Mediterranean, and at the same time allowing the strength of peace-loving countries to be strengthened in order to resist aggressive attempts. (23rd dispatch from Havas)

Warsaw: Regarding the mutual assistance declaration recently signed between France and Turkey, political figures here all expressed joy, saying that this is "an effective guarantee for maintaining the status quo in the eastern Mediterranean," which is also a necessary supplement to the British-Turkish mutual assistance declaration of May 12 and opens the way for the Turkish-Egyptian agreement. (23rd dispatch from Havas)

Washington: Diplomatic figures here expressed a warm welcome to the mutual assistance declaration signed between France and Turkey, saying that the strength of the European peace front will be strengthened as a result, and it will also have a good impact on the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (23rd dispatch from Havas)

Berlin: After the establishment of the French-Turkish mutual assistance declaration and the agreement on the Sanjak region, German political figures expressed indignation, believing that this move was also "a link in the encirclement chain," and also pointed out that the cession of the Sanjak region was an "immoral" action, therefore taking the opportunity to loudly demand the recovery of old colonies and various places currently ruled by various countries. The Nazi Party's organ, the "People's Observer," stated that "The democratic countries are now arbitrarily destroying the current treaties. After the establishment of the French-Turkish mutual assistance declaration, Italy's position in the Mediterranean will be affected. The agreement established between Britain and Italy on April 16 last year strictly stipulated that the status quo in the Mediterranean should be maintained. This provision is now destroyed by France." (23rd dispatch from Havas)

(Berlin) The "Foreign Traffic News" stated that the return of Alexandretta to Turkey is destroying the status quo in the Mediterranean and France's "sacred trusteeship obligation." Since the Great War, the Western powers have first decided to return the stolen property to its original owner, but those people have used all possible tricks to refuse to return Germany's colonies. (23rd dispatch from Reuters)

Rome: The transfer of the Sanjak region of the Syrian Republic (French mandate) to Turkey was recently commented on by Fascist figures here, who said that France has already violated the obligations of a mandate power. During the Abyssinian War, the League of Nations made many demands on Italy. Now France arbitrarily disposes of a part of the territory of a mandate territory, and the League of Nations has not expressed any objection, which is inevitably strange. (23rd dispatch from Havas)

### Turkey Considers Fortifying the Sanjak Region, Turning It into a Strategic Base

Ankara: It has been learned here that Turkey intends to turn Alexandretta into a valuable strategic base. In view of its new obligations to Britain and France in the Mediterranean, the country has recently considered plans to modernize and re-fortify the Sanjak region, so that the area becomes part of an important military area. (24th dispatch from Reuters)

### German-Danish Non-Aggression Pact Enters into Force

(Berlin) The German-Danish non-aggression treaty has entered into force after both parties recently exchanged ratification documents here. (24th dispatch from Havas)

### Situation Before Shantou Fell: Japanese Side Buys Off Bandits to Disrupt Chinese Forces, Japanese Planes Bomb Wuhua, Xingning, and Longchuan for Days, British and American Ships Stationed in Shantou to Protect Foreign Ships Entering and Exiting

Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese warship at Mayu Estuary in Shantou dispatched a speedboat on the 14th to break through the Mayu blockade line and advanced towards Getou Village in Aotou, attempting to land. It was repelled by Chinese forces. It was heard that Chen Qiaer, the bandit leader of Shalong, Chaoyang, was also assisted by Japanese warships and attempted to respond in Shalong and Mawei to disrupt the rear of the Chinese forces in Dahao and Haimen. When it was heard that the Japanese speedboat had been defeated and three ships had been sunk, killing and wounding 20 to 30 people, Bandit Chen also remained hidden, but secretly extorted military supplies from wealthy families in nearby villages and wrote threatening letters. The wealthy families ignored him. Li Kejiang, the shop owner of Tongli Fish Bank in Dahao, was therefore kidnapped by Bandit Chen in Mawei, his hometown, and a ransom of 6,000 yuan was demanded. Wealthy families in various villages were terrified upon hearing the news, and many came to Shantou to stay temporarily on the 18th, and some fled to Hong Kong.

Starting on the 16th, the Japanese army dispatched multiple aircraft to drop bombs on the Guangdong-Jiangxi Highway in Dalongtian, Xingning. After dropping the bombs, they opened fire and strafed, causing considerable local losses. At 9 AM on the 17th, another 15 Japanese aircraft, in three batches, attacked Wuhua and Xingning. The aircraft took off from Guangzhou. At approximately 8 AM, two aircraft flew to Longchuan in the upper reaches of the Dong River, passing through Laolong and Zijin into Wuhua, dropping five bombs in Shuizhai and Xikeng. At approximately 10 AM, Japanese aircraft were spotted over Heyuan, Dongxi, Longchuan, Laolong, and other places, heading straight for Xingning to destroy the land transportation on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border. At 4 PM, another two Japanese aircraft flew to Xingning to scout for an hour, but did not drop bombs. The Mei area suffered considerable losses. On the morning of the 19th, an additional Japanese aircraft carrier arrived offshore of Shantou, bringing the total to seven ships, including cruisers, destroyers, and transports, anchored in deep water off Nan'ao. At 8 AM, two Japanese aircraft took off from the sea, scouting along the coastline before flying to Yixi Station outside the North Gate of Chao'an, strafing along the land and water transportation lines. The Yongning electric ferry was hit by gunfire on the Caijiawei River, killing four passengers and wounding over 20. The Japanese aircraft then turned towards Jieyang and went out to sea, firing all the way, killing and wounding over 30 people near Quxi, killing four and wounding three in Paotai City. Wherever the Japanese aircraft passed, there were casualties in various villages. The actual numbers are unknown. Zhalin, Huanggang, Qiandong, and other places also suffered gunfire attacks. The citizens scattered in panic, and the order was chaotic for a time.

The first section of the Chao-Shan Railway has been dismantled, and the main station has been moved to Anbu. Since the 17th, the railway company has provided two electric ferries to transport passengers, departing from Shantou to Anbu once every morning from 5 AM to 4 PM. Passengers disembark at Meixitou and walk a mile before they can take a car. After the forced evacuation in Shantou City, according to the household registration section's investigation, there are still over 40,000 residents. The municipal government has decided to conduct a general registration of citizens. Those who do not need to be evacuated will be issued "residence permits." Those without "residence permits" will be forcibly evacuated to avoid being constrained during an emergency battle. There is one British and one American warship in Shantou harbor, anchored at Qilu and Jiaoshi, respectively. Another larger British warship is anchored outside the Mayu Estuary to protect foreign ships from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia entering and exiting. On the 18th, the Haicheng ship returned to Shantou from Fuzhou and Quanzhou. According to the crew, the goods transported from the port to Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen could not be unloaded. Every time a small boat tried to come to connect, it was shot at and strafed by Japanese armed fishing boats and returned to the port. The original goods are now being returned to Hong Kong, and the freight is also being returned to the shippers. The shipping company lost over 200,000 yuan. The blockade of Gulangyu is even stricter. All boats are not allowed to travel. British ships cannot load and unload passengers and goods, while Japanese ships, such as the Guangdong Maru, often load goods from Taiwan to Xiamen. Transportation between Gulangyu and Xiamen is entirely controlled by Japanese warships. Ships and boats with passes, as well as Japanese and Taiwanese people, can travel between Gulangyu and Xiamen. The Japanese people living in Gulangyu do not have to worry about a shortage of grain. British ships also transport food to help foreigners living in Gulangyu. What is pitiful is that the 50,000 Chinese people there are facing food prices that are twice as high. The situation there is no different from Shantou. There are multiple American, British, and French warships stationed in Gulangyu to protect overseas Chinese without any changes. Shantou and Xiamen are only separated by a narrow strip of water, and their interests, fortunes, and misfortunes are closely related. After Xiamen was severely blockaded, many people from southern Fujian entered and exited through Shantou. There are British ships traveling to Manila that cannot disembark in Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen, so they specially diverted to Shantou. All countries attach great importance to Shantou. Rear Admiral Hepburn, commander of the U.S. South China Fleet, arrived in Shantou from Gulangyu on the cruiser No. 227 on the 16th and visited Mayor Wu at the municipal government. The U.S. Consul held a banquet in his honor. In the evening, the U.S. Commander returned to Hong Kong on the original ship.

### After the Bombing of Chengdu, Population and Materials Evacuated; Over Seven Hundred Civilian Casualties on the 11th

Chengdu Air Report: Twenty-seven Japanese aircraft raided Chengdu on June 11, indiscriminately bombing civilian and commercial areas, causing tragic casualties among the people and burning down numerous civilian houses. The Municipal Government and the City Defense Corps issued separate loss statistics on the 13th and 16th. (1) According to the Municipal Government's statistics, there were four categories: burnt, hit by bombs, collapsed due to impact, and demolished. Based on addresses, there were 1,215 numbers; assuming five households per number, there were 6,075 households. Among them were three cultural institutions: West China University, Provincial Chengdu Normal School, and Huayang County Middle School. The rest were civilian residences, factories, and shops. (2) According to the City Defense Corps' statistics, a total of 61 bombs were dropped, of which 19 were unexploded, 24 were incendiary bombs, with nine unburnt, 498 houses were shaken by the impact, and 741 houses were burned. Forty-three members of the Defense Corps died in the line of duty, 23 were seriously injured, 58 were slightly injured, 576 civilians were injured, and 168 died.

During the air raid, Chengdu Medical Director Chen Zhongyao and police officer Cao Chun heroically sacrificed their lives. More than a dozen others were injured. On the 15th at noon, the Provincial Capital Police Department held a public memorial service for the loyal souls of Chen and Cao within the department. All police officers in the city wore flowers to mourn. Except for those on duty, all participated in the memorial service. The Provincial Capital Police Chief Zhou Jiying also led important police officers to visit injured police officers in various hospitals. Furthermore, over 500 rickshaw pullers in Chengdu spontaneously organized on the 12th and 13th, under the leadership of the Municipal Government, to clean the streets. Chengdu Mayor Yang Quanyu praised the rickshaw pullers for their tireless efforts and awarded each of them 25 cents in foreign currency on the 14th, and each team received one yuan for cigarette expenses as a reward. Additionally, the Ministry of Education reported that over 360 members of the five major rescue teams, including those from West China University, set out to work in the bombed areas immediately after the air raid, rescuing 43 slightly injured and 85 seriously injured individuals. Ms. Huang Xiaolian, a team member, sacrificed her life due to a facial injury, and Ms. Cui Zhihua's foot was penetrated by a bullet. Team member Gan Yongxiang vomited blood due to excessive effort during the rescue. Special commendations were issued on the 16th. The teachers and students of the five major schools deeply mourned Ms. Huang Xiaolian's loyalty and sacrifice and held an enlarged memorial service on the 16th. Furthermore, Deng Xihou, the Commander of the Sichuan Provincial Air Defense, decided to provide compensation to the families of the Defense Corps members who died in the line of duty and to provide proper treatment to those injured, and had produced many honorary medals for the injured, which were distributed to the injured members. He also used white satin to make several banners with the inscription "Glorious Sacrifice" and presented them to the families of the deceased Defense Corps members as a sign of honor.

Various parties are actively preparing for future air raid relief work. The Sichuan Provincial Poor People's Housing Management Office is completing a certain location as a reception center for injured citizens within the week. The poor children's orphanage also started construction on the 13th. The timber for the poor people's housing has been purchased and construction will begin immediately to facilitate the evacuation of the general poor population. The Chengdu Air Raid Emergency Relief Center held an ad hoc meeting on the 16th and decided to establish two field hospitals for seriously injured individuals at Koukou'an and Koukouqiao, equipped with 1,000 beds for rescue purposes. Two temporary shelters were set up at Huayang County Middle School and Lida Middle School to accommodate the elderly, weak, women, and children. A bandage station was established outside the four city gates to facilitate the treatment of minor injuries. The Chengdu Municipal Women's Movement Committee is now organizing five rescue teams, with some medicine, to participate in rescue work in the event of an air raid.

Merchants and residents have been evacuating day and night in recent days. By the 17th, the evacuation was largely completed. During the intensified evacuation, the city and its outskirts were filled with bustling traffic day and night. Now the city's material resources have also been evacuated. Shops have only a few samples and goods. Buyers must register first and can only receive the goods the next day, or go to the countryside to buy them directly. The magnificent glass decorations of department stores have been transported to the countryside and replaced with printed cloth or paper. Only a few goods remain in the watch shops. The large glass mirrors in barbershops are nowhere to be seen. The business hours of restaurants have also been changed. Theaters and cinemas have been closed since June 1 and are looking for new locations to build in the countryside. Watching plays and movies also requires going to the countryside. All production businesses have been moved to the evacuation areas, and producers are working diligently in the countryside with peace of mind.

### A Brief Record of the Fujian Provincial Assembly; The Resolutions Include About Four Meanings

Fuzhou Correspondence: The first session of the Provisional Fujian Provincial Assembly opened on May 15 and closed on the 38th, lasting 14 days. All 35 assembly members, with 31 members in attendance. The speaker was Zheng Zuyin, an executive member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the deputy speaker was Chen Peikun, a standing committee member of the Provincial Disaster Relief Association and the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce. Seven general meetings were held for decisions, seven sessions for review, and 94 proposals were submitted. Apart from one important policy guideline submitted by the Provincial Government for discussion, the rest were proposed by the assembly members, including six general proposals, 24 related to special wartime political affairs, 22 related to civil affairs, 18 related to financial and economic construction, and 13 related to education and culture. After being reviewed by various review committees, these 94 proposals were organized and consolidated into 60 items. Among them, 49 items were passed by the General Assembly, six were withdrawn, one was retained, one was withdrawn by the original proposer, and three were left for discussion in the next session. Generally speaking, most of the proposals were passed. The resolutions of important nature include the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization, the protection of civil rights, the elimination of malpractices in conscription, the improvement of tax collection methods, the evacuation of coastal residents and the solution of livelihood issues for people relocating inland, the adjustment of educational administration, the promotion of women's work, and the protection of children. As for inquiries to the government, there was one related to the evacuation of the population, one related to civil affairs, five related to financial and economic construction, and one related to education and culture, all of which received detailed and satisfactory answers. After the meeting was adjourned, a declaration was issued, which stated that "the resolutions of this session have four meanings: (1) To strengthen military power by mobilizing the masses; (2) To protect civil rights without infringing on national sovereignty; (3) To gather national power without harming the people's strength; and (4) To strengthen emergency-period orders without disrupting fundamental national policies."

### The Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders Each County to Repair Dikes and Embankments, Urging the Masses to Expedite Work During Agricultural Downtime

Xinghua Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously formulated rules and regulations for each county to repair dikes and embankments to defend against floods, and instructed each county to comply. Now, in order to expedite the construction of dikes and embankments by the masses and quickly achieve results, it is once again instructing each county to expedite the process. The order reads as follows: "Upon investigation, the Yellow River breach in Henan last summer has been repeatedly appealed to the relevant ministries and departments of the Central Government to quickly find ways to close it. However, due to its proximity to the war zone, it is temporarily difficult to start construction. Northern Jiangsu is located downstream, and even the Huai River is difficult to contain. Now that the Yellow and Huai Rivers have converged, once they flow down, the floods will be rampant and unstoppable. Millions of people will fear for their lives. Now that the best strategy of closing the breach is difficult to implement temporarily, we have to take temporary measures, organize an engineering committee to be responsible for dredging the rivers downstream into the sea to allow for the smooth discharge of accumulated water and empty the reservoirs. At the same time, we will prepare a plan for closing and repairing the Yun River and renovating the gates, and request funding from the Central Government for construction, to serve as a defense. However, the construction of dikes and embankments in each county and the dredging of silted river channels are also important for flood prevention. When the water rises, they can defend against floods, and when the water is low, they can store water for irrigation. Their benefits are closely related to the people. In order to expedite the work and facilitate implementation, the temporary measures for the construction of dikes and embankments in each county have been formulated and circulated for compliance. It is noted that while some counties are earnestly complying, there are also many instances of treating them as mere formalities and evading responsibility. It is essential to know that this matter is of great importance to the lives of the people. Now that the floodwaters have receded and the rice seedlings have been planted, it is the agricultural downtime. Urgently send personnel to each district, township, and town to strictly supervise and mobilize the entire population to complete the construction of dikes and embankments within the shortest possible time, so that there is a defense during the upcoming flood season, and to prevent a catastrophe. It is hereby ordered that each county comply and report for record."

### Japanese Troops in Kunshan Blockade Chenmu Town to Prevent Guerrilla Attacks

Kunshan Correspondence: Chenmu is an important town bordering Kunshan, Lian, Wu, and Kun counties, with thriving commerce and convenient transportation. Since last autumn, the Japanese army has stationed a part of its troops in the town. The guerrillas stationed near the village of × near the town suddenly attacked the town the night before last. The Japanese army responded in a hurry, resulting in casualties on both sides. The Japanese army rushed to the Kunshan military headquarters to request additional troops to be stationed to prevent further guerrilla attacks. At the same time, the Japanese army further blockaded Chenmu Town, and strictly inspected the passing steamships and civilian ships, and did not allow them to pass through the town. It has been more than a week, and the town is experiencing a great shortage of food and daily necessities, causing great panic among the residents.

### The Puppet County Government of Qingpu Collects Folk Books

In the Name of Restoring the Library

Qingpu Correspondence: Under the pretext of restoring the library, the puppet county government of Qingpu has been collecting folk books on a large scale in recent days, and has forced the former director of the county library to hand over the books in the library. Most of the books in the county library were donated by local people, so there are many rare books. After the war, these books were gradually transported to the countryside, so although the library was looted, the losses were minimal. It is recently heard that the director has fled elsewhere due to threats.

### The Circumstances of the Murder of Yu Guozhen, a Veteran of the Anti-Japanese War in Wuxi; The New Fourth Army Has Arrested and Executed the Culprits

Wuxi Correspondence: The Hua Fang military authorities previously sent Shangguan Yunxiang to Jiangsu to reorganize the guerrilla forces in various counties, with the cooperation of the New Fourth Army. In Wuxi, three brigades have been established: Wu Yaozu in Anzhen, Yang Xiaonan in Erhouqiao, and Zhou Afu in Qianqiao. Yu Guozhen's troops in the northern countryside had already accepted reorganization when Dong Huimin and Guo Xishi lured him a week ago under the pretense of a banquet. They ambushed him on the way, shot Yu to death, and completely killed his family. Everyone who heard about it felt sorry for him. Yu had worked very hard in the anti-Japanese war, such as the loss of more than 100 boxes of bullets by the Japanese army at the railway station, the assassination of two senior Japanese officers near the railway station, the interception of Japanese weapons on the Wuxi-Shanghai highway, and the assassination of traitors Wu Zhengrong and Zhong Jiyue in the downtown area of the city, and the attack on the puppet secret service police station in the Retin area of Beitang were all done by Yu Guozhen. Therefore, the Japanese offered a reward of 100,000 yuan to try to capture him, which shows the importance the Japanese attached to Yu. The New Fourth Army was furious at Yu's murder and sent a brigade to the Bashiqiao area to arrest Dong Huimin, Guo Xishi, etc. Dong fled with his gang upon hearing the news, while Guo Xishi was arrested on the spot and executed immediately.

At present, the guerrilla forces in various villages have three names: (1) Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, (2) Third War Zone Guerrilla Brigade, (3) Military Commission Wuxi Guerrilla Brigade. At the same time, there is also the County Security Team. The Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army is mainly led by Zhou Zhengang, the Third War Zone is led by Cai Renqi and Gao Zugao, the Military Commission is led by Deng Benduan and Qiang Xuehui, and the Security Team is led by Ji Boqin and Mao Mujun. It is a pity that they have not been able to unite. It is heard that the New Fourth Army is engaged in incorporating and training the guerrilla forces.

### The Only Way to Marital Bliss

He who loves others is constantly loved by others. This is an eternal saying. A selfish person who only seeks his own enjoyment and does not care about the life or death of others will eventually suffer the consequences of his evil deeds. The various tragedies of married men and women that we hear and see cannot but be attributed to the selfishness of husbands in the remaining feudal society. The wife is his plaything, appendage, and at most, is regarded as property. The husband can be willful and indulge in lust, while the wife can only follow the three obediences and four virtues. Therefore, in married life, the wife's sacrifice is taken for granted.

Knowledge tells us that a woman's sexual tide is cyclical. For this reason, female animals often occupy a superior position in the animal kingdom. The male is only to meet the needs of the female. Like bees, silkworms, and other animals, the only responsibility of the male is to adapt to the mating of the female. After mating, its life is over. Humans, however, because of the male's physical strength, often occupy a superior position in society. Therefore, women are suppressed, and the emphasis on men over women still seems to have remnants of power in today's civilized society. In such an unbalanced life of male and female combination, one party must be sacrificed, but the other party is not necessarily better off. This is a very common phenomenon. The wife suffers from irregular menstruation and leukorrhea due to unreasonable sexual life, infertility, or multiple births, anemia, shriveled breasts, and premature aging, resulting in the loss of domestic help in the family. At the same time, due to the husband's early marriage indulgence in lust, or polygamy and licentiousness, or early self-abuse and spermatorrhea, various pathological conditions often erupt in sexual function, such as premature ejaculation, impotence, spermatorrhea, incomplete development, sperm deficiency and infertility, and neurasthenia. How can such a pathological husband live a happy married life and form a happy family?

Then, how can men and women seek marital happiness? It is said: Only in the harmony of mutual love and coordination of you being considerate of me and me being considerate of you, in the unity of desires. Then, since neither party is sacrificed physically or mentally, and they can mutually obtain pleasure, health will be improved accordingly, and happiness will increase day by day with the improvement of health!

If men and women suffer from the above-mentioned diseases due to premarital self-error and unreasonable married life, they must seek thorough treatment as soon as possible. If they delay treatment, the consequences will be endless! In today's era of advanced medicine, if the endocrine supplementation therapy of reproductive glands can be adopted, it is not difficult to cure the above-mentioned diseases. The "Germinal Substance", a reproductive gland hormone preparation for men and women, is reproduced according to this principle by extracting reproductive gland hormones from strong animals such as apes, gorillas, bears, deer, and sea dogs using scientific methods. Therefore, the quality is pure, the nutrients are completely preserved, and the efficacy begins within one hour after taking it. Within 24 hours, it will nourish sperm and kidneys for men, and regulate menstruation and remove leukorrhea for women. If taken continuously, it will promote development, nourish nerves, regulate metabolism, strengthen the brain, and activate blood circulation. It can cure various diseases radically in a short period of time, and long-term use can prolong life, rejuvenate, and restore youthfulness. Therefore, it is praised by world-renowned doctors as the only sacred medicine in endocrine agents. However, men with spermatorrhea must also take "Himi's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" (available in Wuzhou Zhongxi and other major pharmacies) to stop ejaculation for better results!

### Differentiation of Physiological and Pathological Spermatorrhea

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

In terms of physiology, the semen in a man's body is the endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands. Part of it is stored in the seminal vesicles through the vas deferens, waiting to perform reproductive functions, and part of it directly seeps into the blood to regulate metabolism, promote development, nourish nerves, and excite emotions. A healthy unmarried man or a husband who is separated from his wife for a long time may have one or two spermatorrheas within one or two months due to the excess of semen produced physiologically. Those who do not feel tired or dizzy after the ejaculation are considered to have physiological spermatorrhea, but it is always better not to have it. If there are two or three instances of ejaculation within a month, and one feels tired and mentally exhausted afterwards, dreamful ejaculation is called nocturnal emission, and dreamless ejaculation is called spermatorrhea, which are undoubtedly pathological ejaculations. If semen leaks out even during the daytime after seeing female beauty, or during bowel movements or urination, or when using the brain excessively, it is a manifestation of spermatorrhea worsening into spermatorrhea.

According to the research results of medical scientists, it is known that a drop of semen is as precious as eighty drops of blood. An ejaculation is equivalent to losing one pound of blood. How shocking and terrifying is this? Therefore, young people must cure spermatorrhea as soon as possible. If they delay treatment, there will be endless consequences. The most common symptoms after untreated spermatorrhea are cerebral weakness and kidney deficiency, incomplete development, sallow complexion and thin muscles, and neurasthenia. This kind of pathological youth is common in today's society. Not only is it difficult to achieve academic success, but also in marital life, it cannot be happy, causing hatred from the wife, or no children, or one's own life ends, resulting in the greatest tragedy in life!

Spermatorrhea is not an incurable disease. If effective medicine is taken, it can be effective. Effective medicines are praised by world-renowned doctors as "Himi's Semen-Consolidating Tablets". After taking it, it can consolidate the essence gate, calm the nerves, and allow for peaceful sleep, reduce dreams, and stop spermatorrhea on the same night. If there are the above-mentioned symptoms due to untreated spermatorrhea, you must also take the reproductive gland hormone agent "Germinal Substance" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continued use can radically cure various diseases as soon as possible and make the body healthier. Patients can come to this clinic for electrotherapy and injections to achieve faster results.

Beauty

### The Beauty of Breasts in Summer

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

In the hot world of scorching sun and sweltering heat, only healthy and beautiful women can stand out. Look: Their clothes are so few, so thin, with only a light sweat shirt and pants inside, and a cicada-wing-like qipao wrapped outside. Some women who wear Xiangyun gauze clothes don't even wear a sweat shirt. With such a light dress, undoubtedly, their characteristics are like the elastic springs, once the pressure is reduced, they become more upright. A pair of towering breasts stand side by side in front of the chest, and the two nipples are like newly budding grapes, becoming more and more upright and lovely! In addition, the slenderness of the figure and the plumpness of the buttocks naturally make the posture in action feel more moving and infinitely beautiful. Therefore, when they are virgins, they are fragrant everywhere and loved by people. They choose a passionate husband very much to their liking. Once married, the love between the sexes is very strong, forming a happy family and giving birth to clever children. How glorious and gratifying this is! However, those who have committed self-abuse in their early years, breast binding, or irregular menstruation, weakness after illness, prolonged leukorrhea, and malnutrition, resulting in the destruction of ovarian function, affecting the metabolism, and thus causing the breasts to atrophy and the loss of health and beauty, are not only unmatched in happiness, but are also hated by their husbands, and their fate must be very tragic! If you want to remedy it, you can only trust science. According to the research and experiments of world-renowned gynecologists such as Dr. Kang Delin and beauty experts such as Dr. Weiniqi, they all unanimously agree that taking the reproductive gland ovary endocrine preparation "Germinal Substance" for women is the most suitable and effective medicine. This agent is an extract of the ovarian essence of strong animals, and is combined with blood-nourishing and brain-nourishing components of mineral plants, and is precisely formulated by scientific methods. Therefore, after taking it, the ovarian function can be nourished, the metabolic activity can be enhanced, menstruation can be adjusted, the palace can be warmed and leukorrhea can be stopped within one day and night. If you continue to take it, not only can the atrophied breasts gradually become erect, and the thin arms gradually become plump, but also can make the cheeks rosy and youth last forever.

### On the Local Treatment and Total Treatment of Leukorrhea

There is no fixed way to treat leukorrhea. Some are suitable for local treatment, and some are suitable for total treatment. Each should be applied according to the syndrome, so as to avoid the disadvantages of prejudice and delay the opportunity for treatment. Unfortunately, nowadays, general city doctors often only have a few small medical instruments due to insufficient equipment and negligent surgery, or stubbornly adhere to their prejudices, only adhering to certain ready-made medicines, and attacking experts with other modern equipment and scientific treatment methods. They reverse right and wrong, confuse black and white, in order to deceive people, which is related to the morality of doctors. By treating according to the syndrome, there is no fixed way. The method changes with the disease, and does not wait for the disease with the method. Therefore, stubborn and difficult-to-cure leukorrhea can all be completely cured by us.

For the treatment of gonorrhea, both local therapy and total therapy are indispensable. If the gonococcus is completely concentrated in the anterior urethra at the beginning, it is not inconsistent with the principles of science to use local therapy at this time. But other than that, injecting autogenous vaccine to increase the body's resistance to disease is also beneficial to the body. If the virus has entered the bloodstream and become a systemic infection, such as gonorrheal arthritis, it is useless to remove the urethra. However, clumsy doctors still boast about the magic of their local therapies. However, it is not impossible to use local therapy at the same time when using total therapy. I have always adopted safe and scientific methods for the treatment of all new and old gonorrhea. Such as German Hisch serum, German Filtrin current therapy, autogenous vaccine, prostate massage, Buqi urethral dilation, local washing method, or first inject bactericidal liquid into the urethra, and then insert the Filtrin current therapy conductor into the urethra to release electric current, so that it can also exert its bactericidal effect.

The six Christian Universities of Eastern China, including Ginling College, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Hangchow University, Soochow University, Shanghai University, and St. John's University, held a joint graduation ceremony at the Grand Theater at 10:00 AM on the 24th. Over 2,000 people attended, including university presidents, teachers, graduates, parents, and guests, all admitted by invitation. The upper and lower levels of the Grand Theater, with approximately 2,000 seats, were completely filled. The national flag of the Republic of China was hung on the right side of the hall, and the American flag on the left. In the center were the flags of the six participating universities. The stage was decorated with many pots of fresh flowers, creating a dignified and elegant atmosphere. The ceremony began on time, with the US Navy Band playing harmonious music, which invigorated the audience. Guests were ushered to their seats, and the male and female presidents and teachers of each university, as well as university graduates, all wearing doctoral and bachelor gowns, entered in an orderly fashion to the sound of music, creating a solemn and dignified atmosphere. The details are recorded below:

Ceremony Proceedings

The ceremony began at 10:00 AM with music played by the US Navy Band. Then, guests, teachers, and graduates entered in order, and the entire audience stood at attention and sang "The Beautiful Land of China." Next, Dr. Bu Fangji gave a blessing, followed by a speech by President Fan Zhengkang and an address by American Judge Helmick. Immediately after, designated personnel from each university presented diplomas and awarded degrees. Dr. Bu Fangji then gave a final address and distributed awards to outstanding students. The ceremony concluded at around 12:00 PM.

Number of Graduates

This year's graduates include 18 from Ginling College, 3 from Shanghai Women's Medical College, 30 from Hangchow University, 55 from Soochow University, 91 from Shanghai University, and 126 from St. John's University, totaling 323. Among them, the most were Bachelor of Arts, with 151, followed by Bachelor of Science with 83, Bachelor of Laws with 25, Doctor of Medicine with 24, Bachelor of Commerce with 15, Bachelor of Engineering with 11, Bachelor of Education with 8, and 3 with teacher's certificates. A total of 43 students received awards. 91 high school graduates from St. John's Middle School and 69 high school graduates from Soochow Middle School also attended the ceremony yesterday.

Summary of Speeches

(1) President Fan Zhengkang of Shanghai University, representing all the universities, gave the opening speech, briefly stating that Christian higher education in Eastern China has temporarily opened in Shanghai in the past year or two due to environmental factors. Many difficulties and efforts have been encountered during this time, which cannot be fully described in a few words. However, gathering in one place due to the environment has given us a very good opportunity for cooperation, especially in the field of science. Due to the cooperative relationship, all science courses have been tested one by one, and books are gathered in one place for joint reading. The collection is rich, and there are many references. Furthermore, each university utilizes vacations and various gatherings to make cooperation more convenient. Based on past experience, cooperation is possible. Before cooperation, it cannot be said that there were no difficulties at all, but by overcoming difficulties and working hard, success will eventually be achieved. The success of this cooperation among the Christian universities of Eastern China can be considered a new era in the history of Chinese education. Today's joint graduation ceremony further demonstrates the spirit of cooperation among the universities. I use "struggle" and "union" to describe the current situation. In this great era, I feel that the four words "united struggle" are especially needed, so I submit this report and encourage each other. Today, we are honored to have American Judge Helmick and other guests present, and we respectfully ask for your guidance. (2) American Judge Helmick delivered a speech in English, mainly stating that in the past seventy-five years, scientific inventions and technological advances have brought both good and bad to mankind, depending on how they are applied. The current world economic system is flawed, with a vast gap between the rich and the poor, leading to various struggles between capital and labor. In my opinion, it is necessary to study the distribution of resources and the improvement of methods. You, who have received higher education, should take on some responsibility for the above two points when you go out into the world. Use new brains of the twentieth century, with fresh ideas, courageous aspirations, bright hearts, and noble personalities, to distinguish right from wrong, and know what to take and what to leave. In this way, you can find the truth and be happy in your heart. This kind of happiness comes from within, not from external sources. Otherwise, the more science is invented and the more skilled human beings become, without morality to help them, the progress of material things will only increase the cruelty of mankind. You must strive for this. Furthermore, the striving spirit of the school authorities is admirable, resulting in today's full house of graduates. I hope that progress will be boundless. I, on behalf of the American people, express sympathy and support for cooperation in Chinese education. (3) Dr. Bu Fangji gave a final address in English, mainly stating that when you graduate and leave school, whether you dedicate yourself to the country or serve the society, the success or failure of your future careers is related to the reputation of your alma mater. You must strive for this. Now, all countries in the world have university graduates. University graduates are cultivated by the country and nurtured by the family, and they receive relatively generous treatment. Therefore, the responsibilities you bear in all aspects after graduation are also heavier. You must strive for this. (4) Dean Shen Siliang gave a reply, briefly stating that today, the six Christian universities of Eastern China jointly held a graduation ceremony. We are very fortunate and grateful to have American Judge Helmick and other guests present to provide guidance. We are also very grateful to the owner of the Grand Theater for providing the venue for a large gathering.

The charity basketball tournament organized by the Shanghai Banking and Insurance Industry Association continued yesterday at the China Youth Gymnasium. Despite the hot weather, there were still over 500 spectators, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. In the first women's game, the Black Eagles were originally scheduled to play against the Isolated Island team. However, due to the absence of the Isolated Island team, the White team was temporarily selected to play. In the first half, the five-on-five game was evenly matched. In the end, the Black Eagles easily defeated the White team by 20 to 9. In the second men's game, the Baoyin All-Stars played against Youyou. Cai Yanxiong of the Baoyin All-Stars scored first, greatly boosting the morale of the All-Stars. Xue Chong scored three times in a row, and Xilin and Xue Chong and Yanxiong added eight more points. Youyou was at a loss. In the first half, the All-Stars scored 24 points, while Youyou scored 8 points.

### The Faber Cup Division Two - Lidu is the Champion

Yesterday, they defeated China by 1 to 0

In the Faber Cup mini-football league, China played against Lidu in Division Two yesterday at 5:15 PM. China had won every game, while Lidu had one loss and one draw. However, since Hengchang Heng withdrew, the games were canceled and not counted, resulting in Lidu only having one draw. Therefore, this game was no less than the final of this division. If China could win or draw, they would win the championship. Otherwise, the championship would belong to Lidu. Therefore, both sides played very intensely and excitingly. Zhang Mingsheng of Lidu scored a goal in the first half. There were no goals in the second half. In the end, Lidu defeated China by 1 to 0 and won the Division Two championship. China was miserably eliminated, which was a pity. In the other two games, Fuhua and Paramount drew 3-3 in Division One. Beixi Tongquan was disqualified in the game against Shisheng. The Division Two game between Fuguang and Weiguang was postponed.

Business News

### Finance - Many Rumors - Cash Drops Then Rebounds - Hot Weather, Only Half-Day Trading, Volume Reaches 700 Taels

Yesterday's spot gold dark market only operated for half a day due to the recent hot weather and the fact that it was Saturday, when foreign exchange markets are closed. The situation was quite erratic, with fluctuations of 20-30 yuan at times. However, prices generally fell sharply first and then rose sharply. Initially, the bearish sentiment from the previous day persisted, and there were rumors of a firming foreign exchange market and some disquieting news. This increased pessimism, and cash dealers were eager to sell, constantly offering gold. Some money changers also started selling. Although some gold dealers absorbed the selling on behalf of speculators, their efforts to push prices up were limited. As a result, the market trended downward, breaking through the 2,500 yuan mark and briefly falling to a low of 2,485 yuan. Subsequently, news broke that exchange drafts had fallen back to 80 yuan, and there were rumors of a 50 million yuan currency issuance. This stirred the market, and buying interest suddenly rose, pushing prices up repeatedly. The price soared by 75 yuan, returning to above 2,500 yuan and reaching a peak of 2,560 yuan. Eventually, some money changers sold to realize profits, causing a slight pullback. The market closed at 2,550 yuan, down 12 yuan from yesterday's close. Trading volume was still active at 700 taels. Gold jewelry also initially fell and then rebounded, ending down slightly at two yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Falls Again by Twelve Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened at 2,532 yuan due to expectations of continued strength in foreign exchange and bearish sentiment. Cash dealers sold 50 taels to jewelers at an average price of 2,530 yuan. At the time, rumors were rampant in the market, and cash dealers continued to sell. However, some Yu-numbered dealers took the opportunity to push prices up and absorb the selling on behalf of speculators. Cash dealers sold 50 taels to some gold dealers at a price of 528 yuan. Subsequently, cash dealers sold another 90 taels to some gold dealers at a price of 520 yuan. Later, some money changers also started selling, selling 50 taels to some gold dealers at a price of 515 yuan. Shortly thereafter, cash dealers sold another 50 taels to some gold dealers at a price of 510 yuan. At this point, some gold dealers stopped buying and observed the market, causing it to weaken further and break through the 500 yuan mark. Jewelers sold 50 taels to some money changers at a price of 495 yuan. The market quickly fell another ten yuan under selling pressure, and money changers traded 50 taels at a price of 485 yuan, the lowest price of the day. Afterwards, sellers gradually disappeared, and news broke that exchange drafts had fallen sharply, breaking through the 100 yuan mark. At that time, 1,000 yuan only yielded 80 yuan. Also, favorable rumors prompted buyers to rush in to snap up gold at low prices, pushing the price up by 45 yuan in an instant. Money changers bought 50 taels from securities dealers at a price of 530 yuan. Then, some money changers sold 20 taels to cash dealers to realize profits at a price of 525 yuan. Shortly thereafter, some money changers sold another 50 taels to their peers at a price of 530 yuan. Sellers became even scarcer, and another money changer, acting on behalf of a wealthy client, was eager to buy, pushing prices up another 30 yuan. Money changers (acting on behalf of wealthy clients) bought 50 taels each from jewelers and peers at a price of 560 yuan, the highest price of the day. Although the wealthy client's buying interest remained strong, some money changers sold to realize profits, causing the market to pull back slightly. Money changers traded 50 taels with each other at a price of 555 yuan. At 11:45, money changers traded another 50 taels with each other at 2,550 yuan, which was the afternoon closing price. In the afternoon, due to the hot weather and the fact that it was Saturday with no foreign exchange market, dealers decided to close the market for half a day. As a result, the market closed down 12 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 75 yuan in half a day. Cash dealers' benchmark gold was priced 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price. Current marked gold was around 50 cents lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there were few trades.

Gold Jewelry Also Initially Falls and Then Rebounds

The exchange rate for gold jewelry was initially 260 yuan per tael at Da Tonghang. At 10:15, due to news of spot gold opening lower, it also fell by a small three yuan. At 10:55, because spot gold had broken through the 500 yuan mark, it fell sharply by another four yuan. Later, at 11:50, due to spot gold rebounding by 60-70 yuan, it also rebounded by five yuan. In the afternoon, because the spot gold market was closed, there were no changes. The final result was a decrease of a small two yuan. Da Tonghang changed its price to 258 yuan, and Xin Tonghang was 257 yuan, buying in at 250 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged

A London dispatch on the 23rd stated that British pure gold did not change due to the stability of the pound. The price remained at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce. As a result, the central bank's purchase price of Chinese cash also remained at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed Customs gold also remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, and 9 li. The standard price for Shanghai floor gold also remained unchanged at 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao.

### No Special Changes in Foreign Exchange - Bank of Japan Continues to Sell, Situation Remains Loose

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. In the dark market, although foreign firms were still busy settling accounts, foreign banks were eager to sell, and the Bank of Japan (Yokohama Specie Bank) also continued to sell large quantities, causing the situation to remain loose. However, there were no special changes in half a day, and trading volume was still active. Hong Kong exchange rates also remained loose due to strong selling by foreign banks.

In the early morning, London Telegraph was quoted at 1.875 higher, New York bank was stable, and London raw gold also did not change. Exchange rates for the pound against the dollar, against Shanghai, and against France were all flat. The dollar against the pound was unchanged, against Shanghai increased by 5 points, and against France increased by 0.0625. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The banks' opening selling prices for spot were 6 shillings and 6.875 pence for the pound and 13.09375 yuan for the dollar, flat for the pound and up 0.03125 for the dollar compared to the previous close. After opening, the Bank of Japan continued to sell spot pounds at 6 shillings and 7.5 pence to foreign banks such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank. Then, foreign banks resold spot pounds at 6 shillings and 6.875 pence to foreign firms. The market slightly firmed up. When HSBC announced that the exchange rates were unchanged and the silver balance was revealed to be 1 point, levied at 1.75%, foreign firms rushed to settle accounts with HSBC and Banque Franco-Chinoise for spot pounds at 6 shillings and 6.875 pence and 7.5 pence. Then, they settled spot dollars with American banks at 13.125 yuan. Near noon, trading in both pounds and dollars slowed down, but there were some trades in Hong Kong dollars. Foreign banks such as Banca Italiana per la Cina and Netherlands Trading Society successively sold to foreign firms at a spot price of 45.25 yuan, and the situation also firmed up. By the afternoon close, the banks' selling prices for spot were 6 shillings and 7.5 pence for the pound and 13.1875 yuan for the dollar, up 0.0625 for the pound and 0.125 firmer for the dollar compared to the previous close. Hong Kong exchange rates, calculated based on the transaction price, were also cheaper by 0.025. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

### Trading in British and American Gold Notes Resumes

Yesterday, British pure gold and British-American exchange rates did not change. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were settling accounts at a high rate, and foreign banks were continuously supplying funds. The Bank of Japan needed fiat currency and released a large amount of British exchange, leading to a looser market situation. As a result, the British exchange rate was 6 shillings and 7.5 pence, an increase of 0.0625 from the previous day. The American exchange rate was 13.1875 yuan, an increase of 0.125. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. Spot gold opened lower due to the loosening of foreign exchange, and gold dealers and money changers supplied a large amount of gold, pushing the market price down to 32 yuan. Later, rumors were rife, and the market situation became even weaker, falling to 2,485 yuan. Gold dealers took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and the discount rate decreased, making it possible to seize cash and increasing buying interest. The afternoon close was 2,550 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 12 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no trading in the afternoon. Demand for British and American gold pounds resumed, and the supply was still smooth, keeping market prices stable. Trading in British and American gold notes was quite active. Due to limited supply, market prices were firm. Demand for French franc notes, Singapore notes, and Dutch guilder notes was low, and prices declined. Demand for Japanese gold notes was high, and market prices rebounded. The evening price was 9 jiao, 7 fen, and 1 li. The market for Korean notes was stable at 8 jiao and 6 fen. There was little trading in the association. Yongfeng sold 1,000 yuan of American gold notes to Shixiang, and Houji sold 50 pounds of British gold notes to Tongyuan. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold notes up 1 jiao, American gold notes up 2 fen, French franc notes down 2 li, Singapore notes down 5 fen, Dutch guilder notes down 1 jiao, Philippine notes up 5 fen, and other currencies unchanged.

### Discount Rate Continues to Fall by Ten Yuan

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts and bills gradually stabilized, falling from 100 yuan to 80 yuan per thousand yuan. However, in the afternoon, it suddenly rebounded by 10 yuan to 90 yuan, 10 yuan lower than the previous day. Interbank lending rates remained unchanged at 2 jiao and 5 fen in both the morning and afternoon.

### British and Indian Silver Market Conditions are Firm

A London dispatch on the 23rd stated that the silver market saw buying from India and selling from speculators. Trading was light, and market makers were flat. After closing, market conditions were firm. The public was buying at 0.0625 above the listed price, but sellers showed no intention of supplying. Both near and far-term silver futures increased by 0.1875. A New York dispatch stated that the American spot market remained stable. A Bombay dispatch stated that the Indian silver market conditions were firm, with spot and July futures increasing by 9 annas and August also increasing by 7 annas.

### The Truth About the New Restriction on Withdrawals

Recently, in view of the fact that since the tightening of the Shanghai foreign exchange dark market, the general bourgeoisie and speculators have been competing to purchase foreign exchange, and foreign banks have been absorbing credit loans due to cash position issues, the Ministry of Finance believes that this has led to a situation where near-term rates are low and far-term rates are high in the foreign exchange dark market, and the interest rate spread is as high as several points. Therefore, the amount of funds flowing into foreign banks has been alarming recently. If appropriate measures are not taken, the funds of Chinese commercial banks in this city will inevitably be depleted. In order to prevent capital flight and stabilize the Shanghai financial market, the Ministry of Finance has adopted the restriction on withdrawals measure from a telegraph, limiting cash withdrawals to 500 yuan per week for ordinary fiat currency depositors, while interbank transfers in this city and transactions with other ports outside Shanghai will still be handled according to the old method and will not be subject to the new regulations. Moreover, the banking and money industries in this city convened an emergency meeting on the 22nd to establish seven implementation measures, which have been disclosed in various newspapers. It can be seen that the purpose of this decision to restrict withdrawals is to limit the flight of large amounts of fiat currency deposits from Chinese commercial banks, and it has no impact on small savings deposits. The fact is very clear. However, because depositors did not understand and mistakenly believed rumors, it was reported that from the 22nd to the 24th, a run on current accounts occurred in various banking and money industries in this city. Banks were crowded with people, and those withdrawing money were very congested, with most of them being small depositors withdrawing only a few dozen or a hundred yuan each. According to reports, the larger banks paid out a total of 100,000 or several hundred thousand yuan in cash each day for three days, and some even paid out up to one million yuan. It is hoped that all sectors of this city will explain the truth about the Ministry of Finance's telegraph to the public and not believe rumors or fall for the tricks of villains, which would shake the city's financial system. Furthermore, in this unusually hot weather, depositors should not withdraw cash from banks unless it is urgently needed, and keep it at home. This will alleviate the shortage of cash in the market and prevent financial instability. Secondly, it is important to know the risks of hiding valuables. The banking and money industries in this city will definitely not stop paying out small deposits, so the public should remain calm and avoid being deceived by speculators and villains. As can be seen from the recent loosening of the foreign exchange dark market and the decline in the gold market, rumors are not credible. (Ying Jun)

Editor's Note: Because foreign banks are not bound by the orders of the Ministry of Finance and pay cash to Chinese and foreign depositors in full, this further motivates those with funds to flee abroad, which is a major concern!

### Yarn and Cotton - Spot Yarn Dark Market Opens Yesterday - Selling Price Falls More Than Before the Holiday - Payment Procedures Not Yet Agreed Upon

Since the Ministry of Finance's telegraph arrived in Shanghai, all banks and firms have followed the regulations, and the market trend has become much calmer. The spot yarn market had been closed for two days. Today, many people arrived to inquire about news. Although the number of people attending the meeting was smaller than usual, customers came to the meeting to make some purchases. Dark market trading has begun, and people's opinions vary. It is reported that Guangdong and Lingnan firms purchased one or two hundred bales of 20-count and 10-count coarse yarn. The market price for 20-count special Jin Cheng yarn initially traded at 505 yuan, the price for Double Earth yarn was 455.5 yuan, and the price for 20-count Shepherd yarn was 390 yuan, more than 10 yuan lower than the price before the Dragon Boat Festival. Several dozen bales were traded. In an instant, a certain firm sold 30 bales. The price of Ai Di Qiu yarn suddenly fell by 15 yuan to 440 yuan. Shepherd yarn also fell by 10 yuan to 380 yuan, and special Jin Cheng yarn was 495 yuan. The counteroffer for 20-count Double Horse Guang was 470 yuan, but the buyer's position was firm, and no agreement was reached. At 11:00, many shouted 480 yuan for 20-count Bian Ma yarn, but no one was willing to buy. In the afternoon, sentiment slightly improved, and there was also favorable news. The price of 20-count Shepherd yarn rose again, trading at 392 yuan. Double Earth yarn traded at 455 yuan, and 20-count [unclear] traded at 492 yuan, with seventy to eighty bales traded. The outcome will have to wait until Monday. All of the above transactions were conducted according to the old rules without any changes. It is reported that Chinese factories used to calculate 30% of sales as drafts and 70% as exchange transfers, but now they will increase the drafts by 10% and ship goods only with full drafts. This matter has not yet been decided, and the situation remains complicated with many uncertainties. Some say that the old method will probably be used, but Chinese factories may change their sales method to full drafts in the future. In the afternoon, the Yarn Industry Association also convened a meeting of industry members, probably to discuss the procedures for trading Japanese yarn and payment issues.

### Typhoon Blows Away the Yellow Plum Rains - Pumping Water to Transplant Rice Seedlings... Farmers Suffer

Entering the "mold" season is the rainy season in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. China has always adjusted the arrival of the rainy season to the bing day after the Mangzhong (Grain in Ear) solar term. Some say that this still cannot avoid the theory of the five elements. In fact, those who are now shouting to break superstitions simply do not understand what is superstition and what is not. Although China uses the lunar calendar, the 24 solar terms of the year actually follow the solar calendar, so the period around Mangzhong and the Summer Solstice is often the rainy season. However, the rainy season is most afraid of the southwest wind, which blows away the rain. The great drought of 1934 was precisely because the mold season blew the southwest wind early.

The southwest wind was called the "ship off wind" by sailors in the old days. In the days when Europe and Asia traded by sailboat, everything depended on the wind direction. When the southwest wind blew, ocean ships could sail to the Chinese coast, because ships sailing northeast must rely on the assistance of the southwest wind.

There is an old Chinese agricultural proverb, "Summer Solstice, southwest wind crosses the small bridge," meaning that if there is a southwest wind on the Summer Solstice, there will be a lot of rain in the future, enough to "cross the small bridge," indicating that the water level will rise very high. This may be because the Summer Solstice is during the rainy season. If it doesn't rain when it should, it will still rain eventually, and there will be a corresponding sign, so it has been passed down to this day.

"If you miss the yellow plum rains, you won't plant rice." Planting rice seedlings requires water, so you should take advantage of the yellow plum rainy season to transplant seedlings. If you wait until after the yellow plum season, it will be too late to plant, and you will have to pump water to plant, which is a double loss. However, if there is no rain during the yellow plum season, high-lying fields often have to be irrigated to plant seedlings, which greatly affects farmers. However, not having rain during the yellow plum season does not necessarily mean a drought. Whether there is a disaster or not still depends on the weather afterwards. Moreover, "drought is a line, flood is a sheet," so the sunny and dry weather during the yellow plum season truly makes farmers suffer by making them exert more effort, but it has little to do with the current food supply.

### British Government Orders American Cotton - Worth Six Million Pounds Sterling in Exchange for Eighty Thousand Tons of Rubber

The foreign cotton market, especially the New York cotton market, was quite buoyant yesterday. Dealers were all buying because of the passage of the Agricultural Relief Act. Reports from Liverpool and Bombay were good, causing the price of spot cotton in the South to become even more firm. At the same time, the British and American governments believe that cotton and rubber are important raw materials for wartime. The British government is willing to purchase six million pounds sterling of American cotton and exchange it for eighty thousand tons of British-produced rubber. According to the intentions of the two countries, if there is no war in the future, both parties are willing to store these easily obtained goods for seven years. The contract was signed in England yesterday, so all parties are very happy. As a result, the New York cotton market rose 14-15 pound-ons. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by a small rupee, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than ten pound-ons.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, it is difficult to find a suitable payment method for foreign firms, which is causing great confusion among all parties. Moreover, the number of goods arriving daily is increasing, and the wharves are congested due to excessive inventory. The managers are negligent due to the complexity of the work, so fires occur frequently at the wharves, causing great anxiety among all parties. Factories and dealers have been holding meetings daily to discuss solutions, and it is expected that a solution will be found soon.

The cotton market, which had been stagnant for two days, became stable yesterday due to the start of dark market trading in yarn. There was activity among dealers. A transaction was made among local cotton merchants for 100 bales of Fire Machine cotton at a price of 88 yuan, paid in cash and delivered at the wharf. The supply of cotton from northern Jiangsu has been relatively smooth recently. The number of goods arriving at the wharf included 1,461 bales of Tongzhou cotton.

### Securities - Foreign Debt Sees New Low Prices

The London stock market quotations for Chinese foreign debt on the 23rd of this month (Friday) fell sharply again, reaching new low prices. Among the upper-tier bonds, the Sino-French American dollar (with seal) and the Rehabilitation English dollar bonds fell by 3 pounds each, with the former quoted at 19 pounds and the latter at 34 pounds. The English dollar bonds from the Anglo-German continuation loan and the Crisp Loan fell by 2 pounds each, with the former quoted at 50 pounds and the latter at 23 pounds. Among the lower-tier railway bonds, the Da Qing bond also fell by 3 pounds to a price of 15 pounds, and the Beijing-Shanghai bond fell by 2 pounds to a price of 18 pounds. The Tianjin-Pukou original continuation bond fell by 1 pound to a price of 12 pounds. There were no changes in the other bonds. The domestic debt market remained closed.

The stock market at the Zhongye Association was quiet yesterday, unlike the previous Saturdays, but the underlying trend was stable and firm. Trading was focused on Jardine Matheson shares, opening at 18.7 yuan and closing with a bid price of 18.9 yuan and an offer price of 19 yuan. Trading volume was not high. Trading in the other industrial stocks was quiet. A small number of Wheelock Marden shares were traded at 34.5 yuan (up half a yuan). Tramway shares were relatively firm at 41 yuan. The rubber stock market was stable with weak demand. The prices of Anglo-Chinese Plantations and Rubber Trust shares saw slight increases.

The stock market quotations for British Far Eastern companies in London on the 23rd of this month (Friday) saw a rebound in bank shares. Mercantile Bank shares rose slightly by 2 shillings and 6 pence to a price of 7 pounds, 2 shillings, and 6 pence. The HSBC London-registered shares rose by 3 pounds to a price of 80 pounds, and the Hong Kong-registered shares rose by 2 pounds to a price of 82 pounds. However, Kaiping Mines shares fell by 3 pence to a price of 17 shillings and 9 pence. There were no changes in the other stocks.

### Metals - British Steel Sheets Market is Quiet

Prices Increase by Six to Seven Yuan

The market for British steel sheets has been quiet for a long time. Previously, due to the abundance of spot goods, standard prices had fallen at one point. However, since the tightening of foreign exchange, prices have risen sharply. Recently, due to the special circumstances in Tianjin, there is no urgent need for this product. Although there are some inquiries from Yantai and Qingdao, the quantity is very small. The factories and dealers on this street also have no intention of purchasing, so the market situation is quiet. Only a few dozen loads were traded yesterday. However, prices have risen by six to seven yuan compared to the previous market. For example, 5 li and 7.5 li are selling for 25 yuan, 1 fen is selling for 20 yuan, 1.5 fen is selling for 19 yuan, and 2 fen is offered at 18.5 yuan (unit per market load).

### Grains - Four Dealers Disappear - Rice Prices Fall by Two to Three Jiao

The source of Du Geng [glutinous rice variety] from various dealers has stopped. There are no arrivals from Hexia. There are over two thousand packages of "Wheel Bun" rice from Changzhou Nan, however. After the Two Publics Bureau issued an order limiting high-grade glutinous rice to 21 yuan and white pointed rice to 17 yuan, national dealers have disappeared. Only shops on this street have slightly increased their purchases. However, due to financial conditions, there are very few large-scale transactions, so the situation is weak. The market has fallen. As a result, the prices of thick and thin glutinous rice vary depending on the quality, falling by two to three jiao. Du Yang pointed and customer pointed also fell by two jiao or more.

Sticky Rice - Limited outlets, but because the price is close to glutinous rice, dealers are unwilling to lower it further, resulting in a stable situation.

Ke Xian [rice variety] - Yesterday the market had returned to normal. There were inquiries from both domestic and foreign dealers. However, due to the cash shortage and price limits, the market has been suppressed by two to three jiao. Domestic dealers sold over seven hundred packages of crushed rice from Jiangsu, with prices ranging from 15.7 yuan to 15.5 yuan. Dealers on this street sold one thousand three hundred to four hundred packages of Jingwu rice from Anhui, with high-grade priced at 17 yuan and middle-grade priced at 16.5 yuan and 16 yuan. Selling prices were all within the price limits, and inventory was abundant. There are still over 300,000 packages in Shanghai, and the supply continues uninterrupted. The market may gradually stabilize. However, according to news from Anhui merchants, the current price in Anhui has risen, making it difficult to supply in the future.

### Flour Market Quiet - Taicang New Wheat at 6.7 Yuan

The market for prepared flour continues to be quiet. Because it is the weekend, and the factory has changed to 4 yuan, 8 jiao, and half the cash price, they are temporarily refusing to negotiate exchange transfer prices, so transactions with customers remain effectively suspended. There are only small wholesale transactions of 30 to 50 packages or 100 to 200 packages on this street. The market remains unchanged in this environment. The general expectation is that the official market will only reopen after the financial issues stabilize.

New wheat supplies have been arriving in small quantities along the Hu Ning Road area for several days. In the midst of the current cash shortage, the market had become stagnant. Yesterday, there were slight inquiries from this street, with over two hundred packages of Taicang new wheat offered at 6.7 yuan. A lively market may still have to wait.

### Sugar Market: Raw White Recovers Slightly

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight increase due to Dutch telegrams.

July/August was quoted at 8.60 Dutch guilders, September/October at 8.30 Dutch guilders. London telegrams showed a slight decline: August was down 0.75 at 7 shillings, 3.5 pence; December down 0.25 at 6 shillings, 2.5 pence; March of next year down 0.5 pence at 6 shillings, 3 pence. The local guild’s prices continued to recover slightly. Spot prices were 24 yuan for raw white, 29 yuan at this company, 28.8 yuan at other companies, and 20.8 yuan for transit cargo (200 bags). Bonded goods were 20.5 yuan (400 bags), up a little 0.45 yuan. Taikoo refined white B mark was up a little 0.2 yuan, with 100 bags traded at 28.6 yuan. Jardine Matheson’s red mark was 18.6 yuan (100 bags). There was little change in the price of Dutch red sugar spot, up 0.2 yuan to 20 yuan, transit cargo was 14 yuan. The national product was still quoted high and there were no real transactions. Due to sales and exchange considerations, prices are bound to rise.

### Piece Goods: Summer Fabrics and Woolens - Sales are Uneven

Sales of summer fabrics and woolens have been mostly retail lately, with few wholesale transactions. This is partly due to limited actual sales, with goods being sold as soon as they arrive, partly due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, leading to sellers wanting to raise prices, and partly due to customer demand having stopped, relying only on local customers.

Paris: The sales of Chinese clothing trimmings at the door-front stores are wider than those of Western-style clothing trimmings. The standard market price initially rose, but later, due to the abundance of national products from Yinfeng, and the continued arrival of goods from Hong Kong that had been detained, the market trend became stable. Recently, sellers have wanted to raise prices, but buyers say that actual sales are over, leading to a stalemate.

Feather Yarn Wool: This summer, striped patterns are the most popular, followed by small checks. Plain colors are less popular. Most of the Western goods have already been sold out. Jardine Matheson’s woven goods, especially Western-style suits, are selling quite well, as they are only priced at a little over 5 yuan per yard, making them extremely popular.

Wanliding: This has become very popular recently, with beige and evergreen being particularly popular. British-made goods are often out of stock. The standard price has jumped by more than half a yuan. There are no domestic products, and Eastern goods are thin and contain artificial wool, so buyers use them less.

Baleni and Panbiequ: Both are selling well, but fashionable stripes are more popular, while plain colors sell less well. As a result, prices vary in strength. Most depend on the pattern. The higher the grade and the better the goods, the faster they sell.

White Drill and White Zhigong: White drill is selling briskly, but British-made goods are scarce and expensive. Eastern goods are plentiful but cannot rise in price. The trend for white zhigong is better than that for white drill. Most British-made goods must be sold for more than 10 yuan. Yongxing Hongkang and Shenzhi products are mostly lower grade and have small flaws, so they cannot replace the sales of the better qualities.

Yarn Linen Tarpaulin: Tarpaulin was initially in short supply and the price rose, but later, other companies brought in goods, and small domestic factories also produced goods, causing prices to fall. Now, due to exchange rate issues, prices have begun to rise again by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Imports of Eastern yarn and canvas are down by two-thirds compared to previous years, and prices are rising. Domestic products are selling very well. Yesterday, the best quality was selling at 0.85 yuan, and the second quality at 0.78 yuan.

### Seafood: Jellyfish Head Skin Sells Well

Jellyfish is a cold food that does not need to be cooked. It becomes more crisp the longer it is aged, and it is clean and hygienic, making it ideal for summer. Therefore, sales have been quite brisk recently. The current market price for two-year-old jellyfish skin is 17 yuan per picul, compared to 14 yuan last year. Jellyfish head is 12.5 yuan. The trend is stable.

### Medicinal Materials: Honeysuckle is in Season, Sales are Slow

Honeysuckle is said to clear the qi and blood and dissipate carbuncles. It is considered a sacred medicine for external diseases. The summer season is usually the peak sales period. However, current market inventory of aged honeysuckle is still large. New goods have recently arrived from Chongqing, about 7-8 pieces. However, sales are not very brisk, so the current selling price is only 60 yuan per picul.

### Imports and Exports: Goods from Wenzhou are Quite Brisk

Yesterday, goods from Wenzhou were quite brisk, with 7,260 pieces of wood panels, 200 pieces of leather oil, 1,220 pieces of fresh eggs, 69 pieces of tobacco leaves, 30 pieces of tea oil, and 1,228 pieces of tea leaves arriving. There were also 10,600 pieces of charcoal. In addition, 800 pieces of sunflower fans arrived from Hong Kong, 22,640 pieces of bean cake from Yantai, and 2,800 bags of fertilizer were shipped to Ningbo on the 20th.

### Actively Adjusting Finances to Stabilize the Market: Please Provide Legal Tender as Much as Possible. The Banking Industry Telegraphs the Ministry to Instruct the Four Banks to Comply. All Industries Eagerly Hope for Additional Measures

Following the Ministry of Finance’s Ma Telegram on restricting the payment of deposits, in addition to complying, the banking industry telegraphed the Ministry yesterday to instruct the four banks to provide legal tender as much as possible. Yesterday, they also received a telegram from the Ministry, clarifying that the restriction measures apply to Shanghai only. All industries still hope for supplementary measures. Details are recorded below.

The Ministry of Finance Sends a Different Telegram to Shanghai

After the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications received the Ministry of Finance’s Ma Telegram (22nd), they immediately notified the banking industry to comply. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the banking industry received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, with content similar to the Ma Telegram, but stipulating that the restriction measures apply only to Shanghai. The ports outside of Shanghai, however, shall still comply with the Measures for Stabilizing Finance issued by the Ministry on August 16th, 1937, and the Supplementary Measures for Stabilizing Finance approved by the Ministry on August 17th, 1937, namely that the number of withdrawals per week shall be 5 percent, but the maximum amount shall not exceed 150 yuan per week.

The Telegraph Department Maximally Supplies Legal Tender

In addition to issuing a notice to comply, the Shanghai Banking Industry Association jointly decided on seven response measures. All banks and money shops are now complying. In order to adjust the market’s legal tender balance, yesterday, the two associations jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank to supply legal tender to their peers as much as possible, so as to facilitate transactions and avoid financial stagnation. It is said that the Ministry of Finance has agreed to the banking industry’s request to continue to provide legal tender as much as possible for legitimate needs.

All Industries Request Remedial Measures

Given that the Ministry of Finance’s restriction on withdrawal measures is the only important strategy for stabilizing finance in Shanghai, all industries have expressed their unanimous adherence to implementing the government’s wartime financial policy. However, all industries need legal tender for legitimate uses such as purchasing raw materials, and they hope that the Ministry of Finance will introduce supplementary measures to facilitate continued production and maintain the livelihood of workers. It is said that certain industries have written to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to request the Ministry to deliberate, hoping that the authorities will understand the difficulties of businesses and quickly promulgate remedial measures.

Market Stabilizes, Speculation Decreases

Since the Ma Telegram and the Different Telegram successively arrived in Shanghai, people’s hearts have been at ease, rumors have subsided, and bank withdrawals have decreased compared to before. All speculative activities, such as cash, cotton yarn, miscellaneous grains, flour, soybeans, rice, securities, foreign exchange, etc., have greatly decreased in transaction volume due to the lack of cash balance, and the market is turning towards stability. Various prices are expected to fall soon due to the lack of speculative manipulation, which will benefit the livelihood of the citizens. This is truly a gift from the Ministry of Finance’s Ma Telegram. As for the foreign exchange discount rate, there is now an official market.

### Restriction on Withdrawals and Discounting Cannot Coexist. If Discounting is Allowed, There is No Restriction. Mr. Lan Ting's Comments on the Discounting System

The Banking Industry Should Seek Fundamental Solutions

Yesterday, this newspaper’s reporter interviewed Mr. Lan Ting on the recent Ministry of Finance’s Ma Telegram regarding the restriction on withdrawals. Mr. Lan expressed his emotions, which he had been holding back for a long time, with great enthusiasm, saying, "At this time, countless people are profiting from the national crisis. The Ministry of Finance’s Ma Telegram

Restricts Withdrawals

Because some people are buying foreign exchange, so this restriction measure is well-intentioned. However, Shanghai still has so-called discounting. He personally believes that if there is a restriction, there should be no discounting. If discounting is allowed, there is no restriction." He continued, "The purpose of discounting can be said to be mostly for speculation in foreign exchange. On one hand, you want to curb foreign exchange speculation, and on the other hand, you allow discounting, so it is difficult to effectively curb speculation. Or it can be said that discounting opens the door

to Manipulation

for these speculators. Now the government stipulates that national needs, charitable causes, and wage payments are not subject to the restriction on withdrawals. Then what is the need for discounting? He believes that as long as discounting exists, foreign exchange speculation cannot be eradicated. If there is no discounting in the market, prices will naturally stabilize, and the people’s lives can be stabilized. This important financial issue concerns the national economy and

the National Lifeline

It is very important to seek a thorough solution as soon as possible." Mr. Lan has witnessed the facts and feels uneasy, so he hopes that the financial community, the banking industry, and all citizens can recognize the greater good, sacrifice the lesser self, and seek a fundamental solution for the stability of the entire financial system.

### Rice Prices Gradually Fall Back. Fixed Price Limit for Medium Quality Rice. Yesterday, the Rice Industry Groups Decided to Comply. Rice Transactions are All Settled in Cash

Since the authorities of the International Settlement and the French Concession have fixed the price limits for white keng and ke sin rice in order to maintain the people’s livelihood and stabilize prices, and have appointed supervisors to be stationed at the rice market to investigate and deal with those who exceed the price limits, the Qianhengyu Rice Store on Xinzha Road has already received a warning. The rice industry groups held a joint meeting yesterday and decided to set standard prices for medium quality rice. Market transactions have all fallen to the price limit. The Rice Management Committees of the two Concessions will hold a meeting on the 27th to discuss rice prices and facilitate the flow of rice. Details are recorded below.

Joint Meeting of Rice Industry Groups

The rice industry groups held a joint meeting at the market at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The attendees included Chen Ziyi and Zhu Zixiang from the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, and Qu Zhenhua from the Rice Store Association, Yan Jiyun, Xia Zhengxiang, and Zhu Qiuiong from the South Helper Association, Jiang Shiya from the Rice Transporters Association, Zhang Songtao from the Rice Retailers Association, Cai Weixiang from the Broker Friendship Association, and Fu Qiangeng, Wang Tianchou, Gu Yisheng, and Zhou Zhibai from the Market Management Committee. The meeting was chaired by Fu Qiangeng, and recorded by Wang Zhanting. First, the chairman reported on the authorities of the two Concessions fixing the price limits for white keng and ke sin rice in order to maintain the people’s livelihood. However, although the prices of the various grades of rice have been stipulated to be reduced separately, it seems that the standard prices of the various grades of medium quality rice should be stipulated to facilitate transactions. Then, the standard prices were set (see the public notice). The meeting adjourned at 10:15 a.m.

Standard Prices for Medium Quality Rice

The Market Management Committee issued a public notice at the market yesterday, saying, "Recently, the representatives of the rice industry groups at the city’s rice market decided at a joint meeting that, in addition to the price limits set by the authorities, the prices of all grades of goods will be tentatively set as follows: (1) Top quality Xichang white keng: 21 yuan; (2) Suzhou, Kunshan, Changzhou, etc. white keng: 20.8 yuan; (3) Same grade rice: 20.6 yuan; (4) Special thin rice: 21 yuan; (5) Large market thin rice: 20.6 yuan; (6) Lower river special thin rice: 20.5 yuan; (7) Early rice: 20.2 yuan. The above are based on fresh rice as the standard. Those from last season should be adjusted accordingly. All expenses shall be handled in accordance with previous regulations. This notice."

Report Daily Sales Volume to the Authorities

The Soybean and Rice Market Management Committee issued a public notice stating, "In order for the British Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council to inquire about the total daily sales volume of the market, from now on, all businesses shall still fill out the forms with the daily sales volume and send them to the Association for compilation and reporting. The daily sales volume report forms can be obtained from the Association’s office. All businesses are expected to comply uniformly and not be negligent. If any hindrance occurs due to failure to report, this Association will not be able to guarantee protection. All businesses should pay attention to this."

Buy and Sell Each Other According to Price Limits

The rice market opened as usual at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Since the Soybean and Rice Association issued a public notice that all market transactions must comply with the stipulated price limits, the rice price in the market fell back yesterday morning. The prices of all grades of medium quality rice have also fallen to the price limit. People’s hearts have become stable and order has gradually improved. The Rice Management Committees of the two Concessions have scheduled a meeting for the 27th (Tuesday). It is said that the meeting will discuss (1) stabilizing rice prices, and all rice merchants must trade in accordance with the stipulated price limits; (2) making every effort to facilitate the flow of domestic rice.

Association Meeting Decides on Cash Settlement

The Soybean and Rice Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. The attendees included Yu Bingwen, Chen Shide, Xing Zhigang, Yang Heqing, Zhu Zixiang, Zhu Xiangyun, Jin Zhaoyun, Yan Xiaoquan, Jiang Hongbin, He Xianggu, Wu Zisheng, He Quansheng, Huang Zhihe, Fu Qiangeng, and Chen Ziyi, totaling 15 people. Chen Ziyi was elected as the temporary chairman. First, the chairman reported that the Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent speculators from purchasing foreign exchange with cash and disrupting the financial system, has stipulated the restriction on withdrawals in the Ma Telegram in order to safeguard the financial market. How should this industry handle buying and selling? Please share your opinions, etc. After discussion, it was decided that since rice is related to the people’s livelihood and is of utmost importance, it should still be settled in legal tender as usual. At the same time, it was decided that future meetings will be held at 5:00 p.m.

Public Notice to the Market for Uniform Compliance

After the Association reached a decision, it immediately issued a public notice at the market, saying, "Recently, the city’s financial system has been changed by order. All rice transactions completed before the 20th of this month should still be settled in cash, as stated in the public notice issued on the 23rd of this month. As for subsequent rice transactions, the price should still be paid in cash. This has been decided at the joint meeting of directors and supervisors. Therefore, this case is recorded and announced, and it is hoped that everyone will comply. This is a special public notice." In addition, the Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association also posted the same public notice at the market.

### Japanese Troops Forcibly Land Again. There is Now Warfare in Dinghai. Japanese Troops Have Landed Several Times at Putuoshan, etc., But It Has No Impact on the Overall Defense of Eastern Zhejiang

The news that Japanese troops landed in Dinghai has aroused the attention of Zhejiang natives in Shanghai. However, only Japanese propaganda has been seen. Shanghai has not received direct telegrams from Dinghai. In addition, shipping between Shanghai and Dinghai has been cut off, so the situation is even more isolated. However, the Shanghai office of a certain shipping company in Shanghai received a telegram from a ship at 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. Because the ship was sailing between Dinghai and Ningbo, the telegram mentioned that there was warfare in Dinghai. The ship sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai yesterday morning, and when it arrived at the waters off Ligang, it went directly to Shipu and suspended its voyage to Dinghai. From this, it can be inferred that the situation in Dinghai seems to be uneasy. However, Dinghai is a cluster of islands, and there is no land connection to eastern Zhejiang, so even if there are changes, it is not worth emphasizing.

Japanese Propaganda on Landing News

Since the Japanese naval authorities announced yesterday morning that Japanese naval landing forces had forcibly landed on the Zhoushan Islands on the morning of the 23rd, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from related parties yesterday that the Zhoushan Islands (i.e., Dinghai County) are islands off the coast of Ningbo and Zhenhai in eastern Zhejiang, including Daishan, Putuo, Qushan, Dinghai, etc. The four sides are adjacent to the sea and are not important militarily. There are no troops stationed there after the war, and only the people’s self-defense forces and county government police maintain order. Japanese naval forces have landed several times at Putuoshan and other places, and then automatically withdrew. Daishan and Qushan were occupied by Japanese naval forces led by He Yin last month. However, they were attacked by Chinese guerrillas from time to time, so the office of the Japanese naval commander has now been moved to a warship. The president of the "Maintenance Association" of the mountain, Fei Gongzai, was killed by guerrillas on the 20th of this month.

Gaodeng Ship Telegrams on Warfare

As for Dinghai, because it is the seat of the county government, the Gaodeng ship of the German-owned Lulin Company sails between Ningbo and Dinghai, and commerce is more prosperous than in other parts of the county. The Dinghai Natives Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Dinghai County Government yesterday to inquire about the truth. Because wireless communication was interrupted, it was impossible to communicate. However, the Gaodeng ship sailing between Ningbo and Dinghai sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, saying that there is now warfare in Dinghai, which confirms that the Japanese naval forces that landed have encountered fierce resistance from the local government, militia, and police. However, because Dinghai is an island, the Japanese troops have landed, but it has no impact on the overall defense of eastern Zhejiang.

Ningbo-Dinghai Shipping Suspended

The foreign ships sailing between Ningbo and Dinghai are the Gaodeng ship of the German-owned Lulin Company and the Tianbao ship of the German-owned Shi Yide Company. Now the Gaodeng ship has reported from Ningbo to Shanghai that there is warfare in Dinghai, but shipping has been cut off. It did not mention it. According to the observation of the shipping industry, if there is warfare in Dinghai, then the routes from Ningbo to Dinghai and from Dinghai to Shenjiamen, as well as from Dinghai to Shipu and Ninghai, whether by steamboats or sailboats, will inevitably be completely suspended. As for the Hana ship sailing between Shanghai and Dinghai, it has long been changed to sail to Wenzhou.

Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo Sail as Usual

The route between Shanghai and Ningbo and the route between Wenzhou and Shanghai have not been affected by the Dinghai incident. The foreign shipping companies continue to send ships as usual. The Deping ship of the Italian Zhongyi Company sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo at 4:00 a.m. yesterday, and arrived safely in Ningbo at 5:00 p.m. that evening. The Baoli ship of the Italian Yihua Company and the Feikang ship of the German-owned Lulin Company are scheduled to clear customs tomorrow and sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou the day after tomorrow. In addition to loading cargo, they also sell passenger tickets, but a reputable local guarantor is required.

### Shanghai-Shantou Ships Sail as Usual

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired in the shipping industry, the shipping route between Shanghai and Shantou has not been interrupted. The foreign ships still sail as usual. For example, the Dashun ship of Jardine Matheson is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Shantou on the 26th (next Monday).

### Senior Postal Staff Continue to be Transferred

Deputy Postmaster Transferred to Chongqing

The Shanghai Postal Administration recently transferred a large number of senior postal staff to various places in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. They have already left. There are Chen Shengyang, head of the escort team, Bian Qianren, supervisor of the mechanic team, and Liang Shaolian, head of the foreign parcel team. It is now learned that Shi Yitang, the acting deputy postmaster and chief of the transportation section, has also been ordered to be transferred to Chongqing a few days ago. It is said that Mr. Shi is the most talented of the senior postal staff in Shanghai. This decision to transfer him is deeply regretted by his colleagues in the Shanghai Bureau.

Eulogy (Eulogy 1): On this, the twenty-fourth day of June in the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Local Associations Council, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai French Concession, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Shanghai International Relief Committee, the Shanghai Banking Association, the China General Association for the Relief of Women and Children, the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Shanghai National Medicine Association, the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Shanghai Frozen Seafood Industry Association, the Shanghai Medicinal Materials Industry Association, the Shanghai Western Paint Industry Association, the Shanghai Cotton Brokerage Industry Association, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association's Northern Branch Office, the Shanghai Rice Merchants' Market Management Committee, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Shanghai Sauce and Pickles Industry Association, the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, the Shanghai Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries Industry Association Organizing Committee, the Shanghai Dried Goods Industry Association, the Shanghai Northern Goods Industry Association, the Shanghai Fruits and Native Products Industry Association, the Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Association, the French Concession Branch Office of the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association, the Shanghai Salted Fish Industry Association, the Shanghai Noodle Industry Association, the Joint Office of the Shanghai Chicken and Duck Trade, Huida Tobacco Factory, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Luxin Tobacco Company, Weili Han Company, Sino-French Pharmacy, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, Kangyuan Canning Factory, Hengfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory, Yifeng Enamel Factory, American Asia Company's Deli Factory, Xinfu Trading Company, Greater China Rubber Company Limited, Renshe, Lunshe, the Shanghai YMCA, the Shanghai Paper Industry Association, China Needle Factory, Central Cosmetics Factory, Minsheng Canteen, Wuxi Shanghai Association, Renyi Shan Association, and others, reverently offer simple sacrifices of coarse grain and wine, clear water and plain dishes, in tribute to the spirit of Mr. Cao Bingsheng, saying: Alas, heroes are made by the times, and the wise adapt to circumstances. Heaven endows talents for a purpose, but great talents are often envied by fate. If Heaven intended to create him, why did it allow him to be killed? This is the unkindness of fate. Oh, vast heavens, we knock but receive no answer. Life is like a dream, a bubble, a fleeting moment that quickly becomes a past trace. But when the coffin is sealed, merits and demerits are revealed. In his thirty years, Mr. Cao was diligent in learning and questioning, accumulating profound knowledge. He was kind and loving, making friends far and wide. He resolved difficulties like a skilled craftsman and identified and punished evil like the clear light in the Qin court. In his daily life, he was public-spirited and selfless, with merits and no faults. Yet, he sacrificed himself in the line of duty. Mr. Cao was blameless towards his family, friends, society, and the people. Therefore, his death is mourned by gentry, merchants, scholars, and workers, those who knew him and those who did not. Even his Western colleagues of many years wept for him. Human nature is generally the same, and how much more so for us, whose pillar has collapsed, leaving us without support. The smallest offering of duckweed and the shallowest water cannot repay his spirit. Everyone has one death, and one's words, actions, and deeds during life are all related to society and human customs. We often disregard them, but after death, when we recall them one by one, we realize the importance of the person, but the person cannot be revived. We look but cannot reach him, we think but cannot see him, yet his voice and appearance will forever remain in our hearts. Mr. Cao's body is no longer his own and will decay with the world, but in our hearts, we will always see Mr. Cao's lively spirit, just as when he was alive. Therefore, we know that cutting paper to summon the soul is a Taoist illusion, and preserving the remains is an artistic expression. Paper ashes flying like butterflies are a sign of faith. Buddha said that everything is created by the mind. Now, to ensure that this heart does not forget, we specially establish a school and name it after him, so that his memory will be eternally preserved. A model for humanity and a role model for society, only Mr. Cao can fulfill this. Murmuring streams, misty clouds, the spirit banner is in sight, come and receive this offering. May you enjoy it. (Eulogy 2): On this, the twenty-fourth day of June in the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Jin Tingsun, Jiang Yiping, Yao Zhaodi, Huang Dinghui, Zhang Nianxuan, Yao Yongyan, Cao Zhigong, Huang Zhenshi, Song Menghua, Xu Datong, Li Yun, Sun Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilü, Xu Xiaochu, Xiang Kangyuan, Pan Zhaobang, Tian Shujun, Yu Songyun, Zhang Qiyang, Qu Zhenhua, Cheng Tongsheng, Xue Gengxin, Hu Guoqiao, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Zhang Jinghu, Sun Hegao, Yang Zhixiong, Gu Shouxi, Zhang Yishu, Shen Boying, Yu Ziqing, Ge Futian, Liu Zhongying, Cheng Ziqing, Sun Xiangji, Guan Jiongzhi, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Caicheng, Xu Guanqun, Ding Jiwan, Fei Xizhen, Hu Yongqi, Wei Tinghua, Chen Zhigao, Long Jingyan, Chen Xuanzhang, Zhu Liangbi, Sun Daosheng, Pu Qiting, Huang Qianzhi, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Yao Huiquan, Yuan Jiahuan, Lu Gaoyi, Zhang Yi, Feng Zhizhong, Zhang Yichen, Chen Ziyi, Fu Qiangeng, Ling Youguang, Jin Weiwei, Yu Qiaqing, Huang Jinrong, Xue Dubi, Ji Yunqing, Xu Jinchun, Ma Honggen, Cai Hongsheng, Chen Fukang, Chen Yiting, Dai Chunfeng, Wei Dunyi, Long Xiaoyun, Liu Chunpu, Sun Choucheng, and others, reverently offer sacrifices of livestock and wine in tribute to the spirit of Mr. Cao Bingsheng, saying: Alas, death is an eternal separation, a divide between yin and yang. Philosophers say that although the body dies, the soul lives forever. Then, Mr. Cao must know of our public memorial. With Mr. Cao's profound knowledge, he could have created great deeds and achieved immortality. With his healthy body, he could have enjoyed happiness and lived a long life. This year, he was only thirty years old, bleeding within ten steps, killed by a bullet. Is this fate? Mr. Cao had a strong sense of responsibility from a young age and never neglected his duties. Why did this misfortune befall him? He sacrificed himself, but he was not guilty. In these difficult times, countless people have sacrificed themselves, but none are more deserving of mourning than Mr. Cao. Mr. Cao contributed to society and now departs forever. We regret that we cannot redeem him with a hundred lives. Mr. Cao has now left this world. Has he ascended to heaven or been reborn in the Pure Land? We are still lost in a dream. If Mr. Cao has knowledge after death, we hope he will come to us in a dream. Since ancient times, those who are born must die, and only those who are not born are immortal. Birth and death are common occurrences, but in these extraordinary times, Mr. Cao's responsibilities were great. Now, he has abandoned his duties and left us forever. This is our misfortune and also what Mr. Cao would not have wanted. We mourn at his coffin, our voices filled with sorrow. The world is vast and the future is dark. The empty building only saddens us that the crane has gone, and we only see swallows returning to the old fortress. Tears splash on the waters of the spring river, and sighs rise with the tide of the Huangpu River. The spirit banner flutters, come and receive this offering. Alas, how sad. May you enjoy it.

Words of Thanks: Mrs. Cao Bingsheng then delivered a thank-you speech, briefly saying, "Today, I am honored by everyone's attention in initiating this memorial service for Bingsheng. I am truly unworthy of it, but my gratitude to everyone's kindness is beyond words. People can die any day, but Bingsheng's death was tragic. I could also die, but who will manage Bingsheng's remaining property? Who will educate and raise the young children? I fear there is no one. Thinking of this, I can only silently endure the deep pain and resign myself to my bitter fate. Furthermore, Bingsheng's family situation is bleak, and seeking help is impossible. This is truly worrisome. Thank you all for your kindness."

Funeral Wreaths: Many funeral wreaths were sent by various groups. (Political Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council): "The spirit never dies." (Shen Bao): "A wise man has withered." (Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce): "He was able to be fully devoted to his duties in public and possessed great talent. He had a heroic posture at a young age, but how could he be taken so soon?" (Local Associations Council): "The world lacks capable officials, and suddenly, when the building was swaying, a poisonous hand was applied. Who will be the assassin? There are fellow heroes who will forever remember the deep injustice." (Banking Association): "He achieved benevolence and took righteousness."

### Safety Campaign Promotion Week Ended Yesterday; 500 Scouts Assisted with the Promotion, Showing Great Diligence; the Rickshaw Group Achieved the Best Results

The Safety Campaign Promotion Week, initiated by the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been proceeding smoothly since the 18th. Yesterday was the last day. The film and slideshow "Safety First" have been shown in rotation at various cinemas. The radio broadcasts also ended at 12:00 AM last night. Over five hundred Chinese and foreign scouts have been promoting the campaign, showing great diligence. The award ceremony for the essay competition for students of Chinese schools has been postponed to Monday. The Safety Campaign Committee and subcommittees have also announced the end of the campaign. In terms of results, apart from the public bus groups, the rickshaw group achieved the best results, followed by taxis and trucks. Motorbikes, bicycles, and "collapsing carts" were less impressive.

### British Missionary in Shanghai Describes Japanese Military Search; Personal Experience of Rude Treatment; Chinese Coolies Were Most Affected

The China Press reported that a British missionary (name withheld) arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on Tuesday. He stated that most British people enter the Tianjin Concession via the Wanguo Bridge, as they do not have to stand in long lines behind Chinese coolies waiting for permission to enter. He arrived in Tianjin from Peiping on the morning of the 16th with only a small bag containing pajamas and shirts. The Japanese sentry, upon learning that he was British, led him into a small inspection room. The contents of the bag were dumped out for inspection. A Japanese officer in plainclothes demanded to see his passport and interrogated him. He then ordered him to undress.

He removed his shirt

and socks, but refused to remove his trousers unless he was allowed into the next room. The Japanese realized that he was not trying to hide anything and did not order him to remove his trousers. They then thoroughly inspected his clothing and papers in the bag. If he had not remained calm, an incident would have occurred. In his opinion, the Japanese officers were deliberately engaging in such hostile actions towards the British to provoke anger. If they resisted, they would be arrested for resisting a military officer. After the inspection, the contents of his bag

were thrown on the ground.

When he picked up his shirt and tried to dust it off, the Japanese officer in plainclothes punched him in the shoulder. The Japanese sentry also approached with a bayonet. He did not want to cause trouble and did not move. Then, another Japanese officer arrived and, after inquiring in English, helped him repack his bag and apologized on behalf of the others. He was only allowed to enter the concession an hour later. On Monday,

when he left the concession,

he was subjected to the same inspection. When asked if it was true that Chinese people did not want to enter the concession, he said that many Chinese people, mostly coolies, were gathered at the entrances trying to enter the concession. However, only four people were allowed to enter every twenty minutes. Therefore, the coolies were the most affected by the blockade, as they could not enter the concession to work and could not earn a day's wage. Two coolies could not wait any longer and tried

to swim across the river,

but they were both arrested. Although the consumption of milk in the concession was high, only a few Russians delivering milk were allowed to enter each day. There was an absolute shortage of vegetables. On the day he left Tianjin, foreigners had no meat to eat, as the meat that had been brought in before the blockade was not enough to be stored frozen, so it was believed to be unsafe to eat.

### Passenger Issues on Shanghai-Ningbo Liners

Actual Number of Passengers Exceeded Two Hundred

Regarding the passenger issue on Shanghai-Ningbo liners, according to a Datong News Agency reporter, the Deping, which sailed to Ningbo yesterday morning, had no fewer than two hundred passengers who had guaranteed tickets. However, they were all legitimate merchants with medical certificates. The Moufu, which sailed to Ningbo yesterday, also carried about two hundred passengers, all of whom were legitimate merchants with guarantees, so there were no issues with landing. However, if the number of passengers exceeds the limit, there may be disputes, which merchants should be aware of.

### Financial Situation Stabilizing; Sir Otto Niemeyer to Visit China; Sir Charles Addis to Go to Chongqing from Hong Kong; Rumors of Song Ziwen's Visit to England Unconfirmed

The Shanghai Times reported that banking circles in Shanghai received news from Hong Kong yesterday (the 23rd) that Sir Otto Niemeyer, the British government's chief economic advisor, would soon be visiting China again, which caused great concern. It was also reported that Sir Charles Addis, chairman of the Sino-British Stabilization Fund Committee and of the Bank of England, would soon be going to Chongqing to discuss important matters with the Chinese government. After that, he is expected to leave for England. Banking circles in Shanghai believe that the rumored visit of Sir Otto Niemeyer to China is of particular significance due to the current restrictions on withdrawals from bank deposits. Banking circles in Shanghai also believe that new methods will soon be implemented for the sale and purchase of foreign exchange. Previous telegrams from Hong Kong predicted that Song Ziwen, chairman of the Central Bank, would soon lead an economic delegation to London. However, banking circles in Shanghai expressed doubt about the rumor of Song's visit to England, believing that Song was too busy with domestic affairs to make the trip. Banking circles also hinted that they frequently consulted with Song, as Song had considerable influence in banking circles.

### Investigation into the Responsibility for the Collision of the HSBC Vessel; Norwegian Consulate Investigating; Vessel Did Not Sink, Towed to Yantai; Part of Cargo Thrown Overboard

The Norwegian vessel HSBC, chartered by the Fufeng Shipping Company on Jiangxi Road in Shanghai, departed from Shanghai on the 20th to Tianjin. On the evening of the 22nd, it encountered heavy fog near Weihaiwei and was struck by the Japanese vessel Kaiun Maru. All crew members were rescued. The company received a telegram yesterday stating that the vessel had not sunk and had been towed to Yantai. The Norwegian consulate is investigating the cause of the accident to negotiate with the Japanese side. The details are as follows:

The Vessel Did Not Sink Despite the Collision

The Fufeng Shipping Company received a telegram from the shipowner at about 8:00 AM on the morning before yesterday (the 23rd) regarding the accident involving the HSBC near Weihaiwei. They immediately telegraphed to inquire whether the vessel had sunk, but had not received a reply. A certain radio station received a report that the vessel had already sunk. The company received another telegram from the shipowner Danielsen at 8:00 AM yesterday morning stating that although the HSBC was severely damaged in the collision, it had not sunk.

Temporary Repairs and Towing to Yantai

The company received a telegram from the Kaiun Maru at 12:00 PM today stating that after the HSBC sent out a radio distress call, the Kaiun Maru and two other Japanese vessels, including the Zuitang Maru, did their best to rescue it. They plugged the damaged parts. The Kaiun Maru has now towed it to Yantai. However, part of the cargo has been thrown overboard. The HSBC will now enter the shipyard for repairs, and the cargo that was not thrown overboard has been unloaded in Yantai. All sixty-five crew members were rescued and arrived safely in Yantai. The shipowner will travel to Dalian with the Kaiun Maru.

Norwegian Consulate Investigating for Negotiations

A Dagong News Agency reporter learned from the company that the Norwegian consulate is investigating the responsibility for the accident to determine who should bear it. If the responsibility lies with the Japanese vessel, they will negotiate with the Japanese shipping company to claim compensation for all losses incurred by the ship and cargo as a result.

### Ye Huating Ordered to Fulfill Land Lease Contract

Ye Huating, a local resident, leased a plot of land measuring one acre and two fen located at the intersection of Guanchang Road and Seymour Road, i.e., Block 144, District 12 North, Shangyi District, to Anbu Enterprise Company on November 15th of last year for the construction of houses. The lease term was twenty years, with an annual rent of 1,200 yuan per acre in national currency. The land and buildings were to be returned at the end of the term. It was stipulated that Ye Huating would be responsible for arranging tile pipes, connecting sewer pipes, and filling soil for the gully leading from the land to Seymour Road after receiving a deposit of 500 yuan. He was also to guarantee that there would be a road of at least fifteen feet wide at the entrance to Seymour Road. A receipt for the land lease deposit issued by Ye Huating served as proof. However, after receiving the deposit, Ye Huating delayed the filling work. Despite repeated requests, he evaded the issue and failed to comply. Anbu Enterprise Company hired lawyers Jiang Baoli and Jin Zhan to sue in the First Special District Court and petitioned for compulsory fulfillment of the land lease contract. After a trial presided over by Judge Mo Runhua of the Civil Court, the arguments concluded, and a verdict was rendered yesterday at 2:00 PM, ordering the defendant (Ye Huating) to fulfill the contract in accordance with the plaintiff's (Anbu Enterprise Company) request. The counterclaim filed by the defendant (Ye Huating) was rejected, and the litigation costs were to be borne by the defendant.

### Counterfeiters Sentenced to Imprisonment

Counterfeit Bills Worth 7,200 Yuan Confiscated

On the 11th of this month, the Gordon Road Police, based on information from an informant, arrested Liu Jinkui and two other men from Shandong at the Huxi Hotel No. 13 on Carter Road and No. 15 Ciaan Lane on Lafayette Road for selling counterfeit currency of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. They confiscated 7,200 yuan of counterfeit bills found in a double-bottomed suitcase and brought them to the police station. Judge Jiang of the First Special District Court interrogated them and remanded them in custody pending sentencing. Yesterday morning, at the sentencing date, Judge Jiang presided over the Third Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought to the court for sentencing. Liu Jinkui was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for collecting counterfeit bills with the intention of using them. Liao Zhankui was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for jointly collecting counterfeit bills with the intention of using them. Yang Zijian, a recidivist, was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for collecting counterfeit bills. The 7,200 yuan of counterfeit bills and the double-bottomed suitcase were confiscated.

### Japanese Side Announces Blockade of Haimen; Foreign Vessels Ignore; Japanese Warship Shells Xingang; British Warship Docks to Protect

The Japanese military recently announced to foreign shipping companies, citing military measures, that they intended to blockade the Beisha shipping route and prevent foreign vessels from sailing. However, according to the Dagong News Agency, the Taikoo Company's Wantong and the Far Eastern Company's Haiyi sailed to Beisha as usual, carrying passengers and cargo. The Jardine Matheson Company's Yihe sailed out the day before yesterday, stopping at various ports to load and unload passengers and cargo. A small warship dispatched by the Japanese Navy was docked near Songji Port, and armed motorboats patrolled the sea from time to time, but they did not take any action against foreign vessels. Regarding the occurrence of war in the area, a Dagong News Agency reporter inquired with passengers from Beisha, who said that at about 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, a Japanese warship sailed to Xingang, a port downstream, and shelled Xingang Town. Two shells landed in the rice fields one mile outside the town and did not explode. The other two shells hit a tofu shop and a mill, destroying more than ten houses and causing a fire. An elderly woman and a young child were killed or injured. The Chinese army on shore did not retaliate. The Japanese warship then sailed away. A British warship is now docked in the sea area, reportedly to protect British vessels and maintain transportation between Shanghai and Beisha.

### Lawyer Li and Lin Lizhen Adultery Case Continued Trial Record: The Timing Issue Becomes the Focus of Dispute; Wife Requests Compensation of One Yuan

Lawyer Li (also known as Li Shude), after falling out with his wife Shen Qiwen and forcing her to return to Ningbo, cohabitated with his lover Wang Liming (real name Lin Lizhen) in the attic of house number 65, lane 546, Tianliao Road. Although the residence was humble, requiring a movable bamboo ladder for access, they found joy in their sweet life. Alas, good times don't last. Recently, Shen learned of their affair and reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police. At dawn on the first of this month, Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to the address to:

Raid for Adultery

They apprehended the pair from the attic and took them to the police station. After questioning, they were released. Simultaneously, a public prosecution for adultery was filed against Li and Lin in the First Special District Court. A preliminary hearing had already taken place, as previously reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Fang Qinghuan convened a court session to continue questioning the two parties and witnesses. The defendant, Lin Lizhen (i.e., Wang Liming), was fashionably dressed and stood gracefully beside Li, showing no signs of illness, indicating her ailment had healed. According to her testimony, she is twenty-five years old this year and once worked as a:

Private Tutor

She has known Li for three years and cohabitated with him for two. Initially, she claimed she was unaware Li was married. In court, Shen Qiwen was questioned about a woman encountered in the Dingxiang Garden last July, whom Li escorted hand-in-hand. Shen replied that it was Lin. She also stated that the "affair" mentioned in her letters to Li did not refer to Lin. Although she had heard Li was seeing both Lu and Lin, she could not exercise her right to sue due to lack of concrete evidence, and there was no condoning or forgiving on her part. Afterwards, the court examined:

Lin's Testimony

She claimed that after cohabitating with Li, she encountered Shen on the street. Li then told her that Shen was his wife, but they were estranged, and Shen had moved back to her mother's home and would no longer interfere with his actions. She, Lin, had been cohabitating for a long time and repeatedly urged Li to get married, but he always made excuses. Therefore, she was helpless. Then, Zhu Changlin, a witness presented by Li, testified that before July 20th last year, he saw Li and Lin together in Dingxiang Garden, and then saw the plaintiff also arrive, and they were very aware of each other.

Li informed him

That she was his wife. However, he was not very clear on how many people the plaintiff was with that day. After Judge Fang finished questioning, he ordered the commencement of arguments. First, police lawyer Zhang Shizhu briefly recounted the facts of the case, emphasizing the key point of contention: when the plaintiff learned of the defendants' adultery – before or recently after the Dingxiang Garden encounter? He requested the court to use its discretion in rendering a judgment. Then, Li's defense lawyer, Feng Xizui, argued on Li's behalf that Shen Qiwen did not want to endure the pain of childbirth and, therefore, separated from her husband. She definitely condoned Li's cohabitation with Wang Liming beforehand and forgave him afterwards.

The current accusation

Is purely for money. Her intentions are clear from the conditions she previously proposed during mediation: continued separation, with Li providing 10,000 yuan in national currency and several hundred yuan in monthly living expenses. Lin also hired lawyer Wu Zhengwai for her defense. Finally, Shen's lawyer filed an incidental civil lawsuit against both defendants, requesting the court to order them to jointly compensate her for one yuan in damages. However, both defendants stated in court that they could not bear the responsibility for this one yuan loss. The court then adjourned to deliberate and pronounce judgment.

### Tranquility at Tushanwan

According to someone from Tushanwan, the area is currently very tranquil. The report in the previous newspaper about the new Tushanwan police station increasing defenses was a misrepresentation. No new police station has been established in Tushanwan.

### Rihua Travel Agency Forges Epidemic Prevention Certificates; Three Japanese and Twelve Chinese Youths Arrested; A Young Man and Woman Were Stopped En Route to Qingdao

Recently, a young man and woman planned to travel to Qingdao on a Taikoo Shipping Company vessel. When the person in charge of the vessel requested their epidemic prevention certificates, the pair presented certificates issued by the Rihua Travel Agency, a Japanese business located in rooms 16 and 18 on the second floor of 110 Sichuan Road. The vessel deemed these certificates invalid, requiring certificates from the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department. The couple stated that

The certificate

Was purchased for over two yuan. They requested it be returned to seek reimbursement from Rihua and get vaccinated by the Municipal Council. The vessel's manager tore off the signature of doctor Wang Jifang from the certificate and returned the certificate. Afterwards, the company reported the torn signature to the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, which relayed it to the police department. The General Inspectorate launched an investigation. Chinese detective Fan Defu ordered Chinese detective Sun Minchang to on the 19th

Disguise Himself and Go To

The Rihua Travel Agency. He pretended to want to travel to North China and needed to purchase a ticket. He bought a ticket for twenty-six yuan and an epidemic prevention certificate and a smallpox vaccination certificate for four yuan. Sun had not actually received any vaccinations. He reported this, and on the 23rd, Chinese detective Yang Peisheng, along with Sun, Japanese detective Kobayashi, and other Western detectives, went to Rihua

Travel Agency And

Arrested eight Chinese: Zhang Wenbao, Zhang Luo, Yang Qincai, Zhang Yurun, Hua Anzhang, Ye Changnian, Huang Huide, and Huang Huiming, as well as three Japanese. Along with blank epidemic prevention certificates, they were taken back to the General Inspectorate. Later, at 230 Southern Hotel, 462 Jiulu Road, an affiliate was uncovered, and four more Chinese: Zhang Furong, Zhang Zhengrong, Wang Acai, and Huang Jintang, were arrested. More epidemic prevention certificates were also confiscated. Except for the three Japanese who were

Sent to the Japanese

Consulate, the remaining twelve Chinese were sent to the Special District Court's Fourth Criminal Division yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the situation and charged them with forgery. He requested an extension for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Dai Duo, he ordered them to be detained and await a rescheduled hearing.

### Husband Falsely Accuses Wife of Adultery; Sentencing Scheduled

Pang Qingbao, the owner of Xiaoleyi Vegetable Restaurant on Zhejiang Road, previously set a trap to falsely accuse his wife Cao Fuzhen of adultery with his friend Lu Zhicheng in room 320 of the Far Eastern Hotel. He reported this to the Old Zha Police Station, who dispatched detectives to arrest Cao and Lu Zhicheng. They were sentenced by the First Special District Court to three months imprisonment each, with the option of paying a fine in lieu of imprisonment. Cao, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. After a thorough investigation, the High Court found many doubts, indicating a deliberate false accusation. The original judgment was overturned, and Cao Fuzhen was declared innocent. The First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, considering Pang Qingbao's actions despicable, initiated an investigation by Prosecutor Song Genshan. Pang Qingbao was prosecuted for false accusation in the same level criminal court and was released on bail. The case has been heard once by the Special Court. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Peishen held a second hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Jiang Baolian also appeared. After arguments, the court adjourned the case and scheduled a sentencing date. Pang Qingbao was ordered to increase his bail by 300 yuan.

### Shooting on Avenue Joffre Last Night; Victim Knew of Threat; Prepared Gun for Self-Defense but Failed; Dada Shipping Ticket Agency Located on the Bund

Wang Xiaoping (reported as Wang Shaoting yesterday), a Ningbo native residing at No. 6, Lane Lafayette on Avenue Joffre, operated a Dada Shipping Ticket Agency on the Bund. He was 44 years old. At 7:50 PM on the 13th, as he left home and waited at the bus stop at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet, suddenly an assailant approached from behind and fired a Mauser pistol at Wang's head,

Penetrating His Forehead

Wang fell to the ground and died instantly. The patrol police on the scene captured one assailant, seized the murder weapon, a Mauser pistol, and took him back to the police station for investigation. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Examination Office for autopsy. According to reports, the deceased had received news unfavorable to him, and thus obtained a license and purchased a self-defense pistol, which he carried with him to prevent accidents. However, at the time of the incident, the assailant approached from behind, so the deceased

Did Not Notice

Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Qian of the Second Special Court and a forensic doctor inspected the body. The investigating detective reported the progress of the investigation after the incident. The deceased's wife, Wang Xu (44 years old, from Suzhou), applied to claim the body for burial. The apprehended assailant was not yet sent to the court for trial as the police were still investigating. The official ruled that Wang Xiaoping died from a gunshot wound, and the body was released to Xu

Wang for burial. A Western officer from the police department came to the office, photographed the body, and examined the wound in detail to be used as evidence in future trials. After the procedure, the family prepared clothes and a coffin for burial. The name of the captured assailant is unknown, but the details should be released to the court for investigation tomorrow.

Furthermore, last night at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet, a Ningbo native Wang Shaopin (44 years old) was shot dead by a man. The man was arrested on the spot.

### Elderly British Woman Murdered; Room in Disarray Suggests Robbery

The residence at 211 Rue de Saigon in the French Concession belonged to Toe Freeman, a British citizen and president of the pistol club. Freeman recently passed away two weeks ago. His elderly wife, 74 years old and still in good spirits, continued to live there alone. At approximately 6:30 AM yesterday morning, a Chinese maid entered the house to clean. She glanced at Freeman's wife, who was lying diagonally on the sofa with her hands and feet bound. Upon closer inspection, she was dead. The items in the room were in a state of disarray. The maid, terrified, immediately reported it to the police, who dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They took footprints to begin the investigation and reported it to the British Consulate to send personnel to examine the scene. Afterwards, it was speculated that Freeman's wife was strangled by burglars who broke into the house to steal. When Mrs. Freeman discovered them and called for help, she was attacked by the burglars.

Furthermore, at 9:00 AM yesterday, the 74-year-old British woman Mrs. Freeman, residing at 211 Rue de Saigon, was suddenly murdered in her bedroom by criminals who tied her hands and feet. Based on initial observations, the case appeared to be a robbery. The room's drawers were turned upside down and ransacked. It appeared the criminals were familiar with the elderly woman's routine and possessed a key to the room, as the police did not find any signs of forced entry. While the exact cause of the British woman's death is still undetermined, the primary cause seemed to be suffocation with a pillow. Currently, the British authorities in Shanghai and the French Concession Police are conducting a thorough investigation into the case.

### The Li Yongkuan and Sons Case Continued Trial Yesterday

Further Investigation Needed; Rescheduled for Trial

Li Yongkuan, Li Jia Zhou, and Li Bihua, three infamous salt smugglers from Anhui, formed a bandit gang in the Xihutang Ruanxiang area of Punan, Songjiang County, after the Nationalist army withdrew westward two years ago. They arbitrarily set fires, murdered, looted, and forcibly abducted Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian from Xihutang. They forced them to marry the two sons, namely Jia Zhou and Bihua. They also shot Lin's mother, buried her in a pit, and robbed the Lin and She families three times. Finally, they sold the Lin family's house to a local tyrant, Lu Baoren. After the regular army disarmed them, the Lis

Fled to Shanghai

They hid in No. 11, Zhongxing New Village, Ciyou Road, behind the Xujiahui Catholic Church. They confined Lin and She and restricted their freedom. On January 10th of this year, the two women seized an opportunity to escape and reported to the Sacred Heart Convent, which reported to the French Concession Police. The police arrested the Li father and sons and confiscated stolen goods from the Lin and She families, including gold bracelets, rings, and leather clothing.

After Detailed Investigation

They were sent to the First Special Court and indicted on charges of robbery and murder. Because the incident occurred inland, the Second Special Court requested the Supreme Court's Shanghai Special District Branch to designate the Second Special Court to handle the case. After Criminal Court President Liao repeatedly convened hearings, Li Yongkuan fell ill in custody, and the hearing was rescheduled. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the court convened another hearing. Li Yongkuan, supported by his two sons, Jia Zhou and Bihua,

Was Helped to Court

The victims' incidental civil lawsuit was represented by lawyer Xu Yannian, while the Li father and sons were represented by lawyers Xuan Zhenjun and Lan Xuzhang. The court summoned the plaintiffs Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian to detail how they were kidnapped, forced into marriage, and how their families were robbed. The defendants, the Li father and sons, vehemently denied the kidnapping, claiming that it was

A Formal Marriage

Judge Liao conducted the inquiry for half an hour. Due to the case still requiring further investigation, he announced that the hearing would be rescheduled for July 13th at 8:00 AM. Li Yongkuan's lawyer requested bail, but the court denied it due to the seriousness of the case and ordered him to be remanded to custody.

### Shanghai West Opium Dens General Strike Yesterday; Protest Against Increased Taxes

According to the English-language North China Daily News, hundreds of opium dens in the "Tsu-Tu" area of Shanghai West went on a general strike today (June 24th) to protest the "Great Way" police arresting thirty den owners and smokers, enforcing the new regulations of the "Shanghai Anti-Smoking Bureau" (established only a week ago) by the "Renovation Government." The sudden closure of the dens has created a serious situation among addicts without their own smoking sets. Many addicts, unaware of the strike, went to the area and returned disappointed. Some even stood in front of the doors of the closed dens, yawning and stretching as their addiction kicked in. This dispute began a few days ago when the "Director of the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Bureau," Yu Zhongqing (transliteration), set up an office in the Broadway Mansions and sent a letter to all opium dens, requiring them to re-register and pay taxes according to the new regulations. He then sent another notice, ordering them to comply with the new regulations within three days. The opium dens ignored the notices. The "Shanghai Anti-Smoking Bureau," with the cooperation of the "Great Way" police, went to enforce its regulations yesterday (June 23rd) at 6:30 PM. In the "Little Moon Palace" and "One Four Five Six" opium dens in Xinkang Lane near Connaught Road, more than thirty den owners and smokers were arrested and are still in custody. It is said that the arrested den owners were hired imposters to prevent their own arrests. Other den owners, upon hearing the news, decided to go on a general strike to protest what they called "high-pressure tactics." It is believed that the "Anti-Smoking Bureau" is now planning to implement a new tax rate based on the number of opium pipes. The "Anti-Smoking Bureau" has promised better protection for opium dens to prevent extortion after the new tax rate is implemented. The den owners are reportedly skeptical of this promise. Today's strike not only affects opium but also the trade of red pills and white powder, as most opium dens sell all three drugs.

He immediately opened the door and saw the woman covered in blood, injured and lying on the floor. He urgently reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to the scene and arrested the man inside the room. It was discovered that the woman had been stabbed as many as fourteen times. The man arrested, claiming to live at No. 3 Wangzhi Road in the French Concession and surnamed Hu, confessed that the injured woman was his wife, Hu Wu, 23 years old. His remaining statement was evasive. The police are currently investigating the case.

Robbery in Broad Daylight

Near the corner of Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road near Hall and Holtz, at approximately 11:50 AM yesterday, a man was walking when two assailants chased him from behind. One assailant brandished a pistol and threatened him, resulting in 500 yuan in national currency being stolen from his pocket. The robbers fled with the loot. Furthermore, at 503 Connaught Road in Shanghai West at approximately 6:30 AM yesterday, six assailants broke in, three of whom were carrying pistols. They ordered everyone to be silent.

Hu Shaoqing, 32 years old, a refugee from Anhui at the Shanghai West Daxilu International Second Refugee Camp, was pulling a large flat cart to deliver goods to the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Avenue Saipo Sai at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. A bicycle was speeding toward him from the left. Hu turned the cart to avoid it but used too much force. Hu was knocked onto the sidewalk, and the cart wheels ran over his chest and back, crushing his right fingers. He was bleeding profusely. A patrol officer arrived and sent him to the hospital for treatment.

Young Woman Fell and Severely Injured

It was later learned that the girl had previously studied at a certain girl's school. As the summer vacation was approaching, a major exam was held, and her performance in several subjects was slightly inferior, causing her to be depressed for nearly ten days. It is, therefore, suspected that she jumped off the building to commit suicide.

Man Electrocuted and Died

Xu Chengxiang, a 17-year-old from Shaoxing, who rented a room at 51 Singapore Road in Shanghai West, accidentally touched the electrical switch last night at 8:00 PM, causing him to be electrocuted and lose consciousness. He was rushed to the hospital but died shortly after.

### Thugs Lurk in the Shadows, Stab a Couple

Around 11:35 PM last night, in an alley next to the Central Savings Society at No. 1 Tianjin Road, a couple was stabbed in the abdomen and waist by an enemy using a knife. Afterwards, they were both sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The victims are identified as Peng Hanzhang, a Cantonese man, 49 years old, and his wife, Ms. Li, 43 years old. Both reside in the French Concession. Before the war, they operated a shop in Hongkou and employed an accountant named Wang. During his employment, Wang engaged in fraudulent activities, leading to his dismissal by Peng Hanzhang, which created a grudge. Last night, Wang learned that Peng and his wife were playing mahjong at a friend's house on Tianjin Road. He waited silently, hiding a sharp knife, and ambushed the Peng Hanzhang couple in the dark alley. He stabbed Peng twice in the abdomen and Ms. Li once in the right waist. The assailant fled without a trace. The injured were carried by the police to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Mr. Zhang Shutong's Calligraphy and Painting Examples

Mr. Zhang Shutong's calligraphy, in the style of the Northern Wei Dynasty cursive script, has long been famous. Connoisseurs recognize that there are few who can compare to him among contemporary calligraphers.

Recently, requests for paintings have been coming one after another, and he cannot cope with them. He has no choice but to set a price list to limit them. The price list can be obtained at the inquiry office of the Shen Bao Newspaper, the Gu Xiang Studio on Wuma Road, and the Duoyunxuan on the Pouqiu Market.

Children's Weekly

### How to Spend the Summer Vacation?

— Fenfei

Hurry Up and Decide on a Summer Work Plan

The summer vacation is coming soon! What are we going to do during these two months? How can we ensure that time is not wasted? Well, I think perhaps you all have already made a work plan! Generally, in this summer vacation, there must be many children who have graduated, been promoted, or are employed, each preparing themselves for "the work they should do." However, among these many children, there may also be a small portion who are playful - playing games all day long. This is naturally a characteristic of children's nature. I am afraid that you have committed the above, so I am taking this opportunity to propose to you "How to Spend the Summer Vacation?"

First, "Enrich Your Knowledge": You have worked hard for a year. May I ask, what knowledge have you gained? Although it has been proven on the report card, are you enriched? In other words, are these grades your own abilities? Graduating friends are certainly happy, but during the summer vacation, you should still work hard. Not only should you not forget the knowledge you have gained before, but you should also have sufficient knowledge to apply for middle school. If you neglect it and waste your time, your studies will be like "a boat sailing against the current," "if you don't advance, you will retreat." Although summer is hot, it will be cool in the morning and evening. You can use this time to slowly study the knowledge you have learned in the past, which is "reviewing the old to know the new." Those general children who have not graduated or been promoted must work even harder, otherwise, you will "repeat a grade" next year. Now I hope you don't be shy or timid, as long as you are willing to put your heart into it, there is still hope. Second, "Cultivate Morality": In school, perhaps because of the strictness of teachers, you dare not violate school rules. Once you leave the school gate, you are as free as a wild horse, and you may encounter "naughty children" in the family all day long. As the ancients said, "Those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black" can indeed lure you onto a "wrong path." This is very dangerous! Therefore, even though we have left school, we still abide by school rules and must not be "naughty" by nature. Parents should pay attention to the behavior of their children. It must be strict, and indulgence becomes "doting." The biggest bad result. Generally, employed children must never let go of their own behavior. Remember the teaching that "a false step becomes a regret forever." Third, "Protect Your Body": In school, there are often cleanliness inspections, so you must pay attention to hygiene. If you leave school, you may neglect it. In Shanghai, where there are pigeonhole houses, and especially in the summer, summer hygiene should be especially noted, otherwise diseases can easily occur. When a person gets sick, he is naturally distressed, or if he encounters an infectious disease, it can affect the whole family, even endangering life.

Dear children! You must have already drawn up a work plan. The above is just a general situation. There are many details that you have to decide for yourself! At the same time, I hope that you will not slacken or neglect the three aspects of "intellect, morality, and body" during the two months of summer vacation, so as not to fail the teachings of the teachers.

(Note) Reviewing homework can be done according to the usual "schedule" by repeating the review.

### Why Conflicts Occur

— Wen

Among children, they often become unhappy over a small matter. Even good friends are unwilling to give in to each other, even scolding and fighting. Sometimes, parents cause adults to turn against each other because they love their children, but soon the children reconcile as before. This kind of recurring thing happens several times a day. This is another shortcoming of children and should be corrected quickly. I will now briefly explain a few reasons for conflicts among children below. Think carefully, are these words correct?

One. For the sake of small personal interests… What is meant by small personal interests is only caring about one's own selfish interests, regardless of the interests of the public. This can be said to be the main reason. You often have different opinions from others, so everyone disperses unhappily. For example, many companions get along and prepare to do a game, but each person is unwilling to accommodate the other's meaning, so it cannot be played; and everyone does not think that they are stubborn, but only blames others; and when there is a conflict of interest, they will turn against each other. This is all because they are too selfish.

Two. The harm of gossiping… Some children like to add embellishments to what others say and tell it to their good friends, thinking that they have fulfilled their responsibilities to their friends, but they do not know that they have increased conflicts and resentment among classmates.

Three. Lack of forgiveness… Others may unintentionally hurt you, but you rebuke him even more severely. For example, a classmate carelessly stepped on your foot. He has apologized, but you scold him and hit him until he cries before you consider yourself victorious. This kind of child is most easily looked down upon.

I think children must know that people cannot live apart from groups, and the opportunities for contact among them are even greater. If you always plan only for yourself, then the more opportunities for conflict, and after a long time, they will not like to be with you. At that time, you are all alone, how lonely, what fun is there. On the contrary, if you are willing to sacrifice yourself, do your best to help others, and are kind and friendly, then you will definitely have many friends. Not only will you get spiritual pleasure, but your studies will also improve day by day. Children, which kind of person do you envy? As long as you always pay attention to reducing the causes of conflict, then your future group will also be harmonious, happy, and mutually supportive.

Gifts for Children Lai - This City's Animal Protection Association Donates 3,000 Copies of the Animal Special Issue of the Fuyou Newspaper

Dear children! Do you know there is an "Animal Protection Association" in Shanghai! Its purpose is to have us all love domestic animals; do not let them suffer from hunger and cold, and do not allow them to be abused, because we know that dogs, cats, pigeons, etc., not only serve us, but are also our good companions. When necessary, they are also willing to sacrifice their lives for us! I remember a foreign friend told me a true story: One winter, he and his friend were traveling in a sleigh pulled by five dog brothers when they encountered a wolf halfway. Although they tried their best to drive the sleigh to escape, they were ultimately no match for the wolf. Just as the wolf was about to approach them, two dogs suddenly jumped out and fought the wolf, while the remaining three continued to pull the sleigh forward. As a result, the two righteous dogs resolutely sacrificed themselves for their master. Also, during the Franco-Prussian War, a French military pigeon rescued hundreds of French soldiers in a desperate situation. There are really many stories like this!

During the Songhu Battle two years ago, a Hungarian child suddenly followed his parents and fled from Yangshupu. Later, he discovered that three good friends were still in his home. The three good friends were a dog, a rooster, and a parrot that he loved. Because he could not bear to let them starve to death there, he went from Pudong across the river to Yangshupu regardless of everything. Naturally, he encountered many unexpected dangers along the way, but he finally brought his three good friends out of the war zone. Later, the Shanghai "Animal Protection Association" (No. 18 Ma Huo Road) learned about this and reported it to the American headquarters and the British branch, and they awarded him a gold medal and a silver badge to reward this little hero.

Because the Shanghai "Animal Protection Association" wants to promote the protection of domestic animals, it specifically borrowed the "Guangxue Society's Fuyou Newspaper to publish an animal special issue, preparing to distribute it to you children. The content includes "A Petition," "The Emperor's Nightingale," "Loyal Little Yellow," "Magic"... etc. After you see this good news, please quickly tell your classmates, and please ask your principal to write to the "Fuyou Newspaper at No. 128 Museum Road, Shanghai Guangxue Society" to request it.

### Two Little Swans in the Flames of War

### Graduation Ceremony (Part 1)

— Lao Du

On this day, our school held a grand graduation ceremony, with tens of thousands of people crowding in front of the chapel. I spent a lot of effort and was finally squeezed in by them. I wanted to find a seat in the center, but in fact, it had already been taken by the audience. I squeezed forward even more, looking around for an empty seat. In the very front two or three rows, I finally found one with great difficulty.

Here, a girl left some empty seats for me and looked at me with her wide brown eyes. Her face was as beautiful as a rose in the morning light. Gradually, I also realized that my gaze was fixed on her face, but every time it met her lively and smiling eyes. This girl seemed to want to be friends with me. She returned my handkerchief that had fallen to the ground with a clever smile, and I thanked her gratefully. This sound was considered the most appropriate introduction by both parties. At this time, another person squeezed down and sat next to me, which made me even closer to her, so we immediately became very familiar.

"It's very crowded here"! She said to me.

"That's right," I replied, "Everyone likes to see the last stage of students entering society." Her face smiled, and her father said very proudly: "My brother is graduating today, and he will also go on stage to give a speech, so I came with this bouquet of flowers, ready to throw it up when he finishes his speech." This flower is not a treasure from the flower shop, but a very common offering flower in the family, just like we are holding our grandmother. "But," I thought, "This flower is ordinary, but her brother must like it, because it was sent by his sister."

"That's my brother." She said, gazing at the bouquet.

"Is it the one with the light-colored hair"? I asked.

"No," she shook her head with a smile, seemingly unintentionally blaming me. "Not the one who looks ordinary. He has very beautiful coffee-colored and wavy hair, and his eyes look brown, but they are actually dark brown. Over there, his hand is raised high, have you seen him"?

She looked at him very eagerly from me, and looked at me from him, as if trying her best to make me see that he was her brother.

"I see him," I said. "He is a very handsome brother."

"Yes, he is very beautiful," she said very happily and frankly: "He is so good and so hardworking! After my mother died, he cared for me. Although he is not a representative to give farewell words, he has won honors in his class."

I thought she was very close to this school and was particularly concerned about her brother's studies, hopes, and success.

### Children's Road Safety Campaign

— Ying Dai

Children! The Public Concession and the French Concession will hold a Road Safety Campaign Week starting from June 18th. Indeed, in this city of Shanghai, after the number of cars has increased, the number of accidents has also increased year by year. After the population of the concession increased sharply, the number of victims of car accidents also set a new record. Because the number of children killed and injured in accidents is not small, children should also pay considerable attention to the issue of road safety campaigns.

Regarding the road safety of children, we of course hope that general elementary school teachers will take the opportunity to instill some common sense about road safety in class, so that general children know to be careful when walking, and they can be familiar with various traffic rules. But on the other hand, children should also pay attention to road safety at all times, so that they will not encounter danger when walking.

Children under the age of ten must not walk on the road alone, and should be accompanied by parents or adults when going out. Regarding this point, parents should of course pay special attention. After school, students chasing each other on the road can easily cause accidents. As for roller skating and learning to ride a bicycle on the road, it is even more dangerous. These bad habits should absolutely not be contaminated.

Every child should know the road traffic rules. Walk on the left, walk on the sidewalks on both sides. The middle is the passage for vehicles; be extra careful when crossing the road: where there are traffic lights, you can only pass when the green light is on, and the red light cannot be walked; there is also a kind of automatic traffic light with three colors of lights, in addition to the red and green lights, there is also a yellow light, which indicates that the color of the light is about to change. Once you see the yellow light. You can't cross over either; where there are no traffic lights, the policeman raises his hand to block you, which is an indication that you can't cross over; some cars are equipped with automatic pointers when turning, and some are gestured by the driver, no matter whether it is a pointer or a gesture, which side it points to, it means that the car is going to turn to that side; these are things everyone should know.

Children are most likely to listen to instructions, and will do as they are told once they know them. But for all kinds of common sense about road safety, children should not only know it themselves, but also be responsible for promoting and relaying it to others. If people at home do not understand or relatives and friends from the inland do not know the traffic rules of Shanghai at all, then children can tell them. In this way, not only can you walk safely, but even others can walk safely because of your relay. Well, during this Road Safety Campaign Week, we sincerely hope that all children in Shanghai can pay extra attention to walking safety and engage in publicity.

### One Stroke Drawing

### The Natural World in Summer

— Li Yuyong

In summer, the mercury in the thermometer stretches lazily, unless it is very cool, it is too lazy to move at all.

When you get up in the morning, if you take a walk on the grass, your shoes will get wet with the dew on the grass. Those butterflies whose wings have been wetted by the dew do not fly out until eight or nine o'clock. At this time, the annoying flies also come out. In the evening, you can only hear the mosquitoes buzzing: under the light of the electric light, you can also see many small moths, floaters, etc. flying around; so many people hang garlic to prevent them from flying close. But when the electric light is turned off, bed bugs come out to bite people.

If it is even hotter, you can also hear the cicadas chirping, coming from the thick shade of those French parasol trees along the street. There are many dragonflies flying by the pool. Sometimes they fly close to the surface of the water and lay many eggs in a string. In the countryside, as soon as the evening arrives, the sound of the mole crickets in the fields is mistaken for earthworms. Bats are catching mosquitoes and moths in the dark, and fireflies are lighting up and flying in the grass.

Sometimes when the climate changes, we can see even more small animals. The spider will no longer make a delicate web when it is about to rain, and swarms of dragonflies and a few solitary horseheads will fly out at this time. When the heavy rain is over, snails crawl on the walls, and earthworms escape from the full water holes and die of illness.

In the suburbs, this is the season when wildflowers are in full bloom. If we pay a little attention, we can know that their flowers bloom at what time in the morning and at what time in the evening, and they all have a certain time. So some people arrange them into a "flower clock" according to the time of flowering. It's just that we haven't seen wildflowers for a long time on the isolated island, so let's wait for victory to make the fun "flower clock".

### Among the Beasts (6)

— Xin Qing

After being injured, Knox felt resentful and mumbled to himself for a full half hour, not knowing who had hurt him. Before long, however, he gradually fell asleep and dreamed of his enemy, barking at him incessantly.

Peng Qi, having stabbed Knox, slipped away to play with Le Fu. He picked up a cane and threw it at him. Le Fu dared not be negligent and hurriedly caught it with his teeth. Peng Qi walked over, grabbed one end of the cane, and spun it around vigorously. Le Fu's body followed the spinning cane, something he was used to. However, this time his teeth seemed to have weakened, and by the fifth spin, he lost his grip on the cane, something that had never happened before.

Le Fu, seeing the fierce glint in Peng Qi's eyes, knew he was in for a beating. With a bark and a spin, he fled for his life. Peng Qi chased him for a while but couldn't catch him. Instead, he ran into Xiao Tang, who was chasing a Scottish foxhound, throwing stones at it. Peng Qi thought this was a great game and immediately joined the chase. A large stone he threw struck the dog's head squarely, instantly ending its life.

That night, a neighbor lost a fine foxhound, and the river gained a dog's corpse.

When Peng Qi went to bed, he tossed and turned for a long time, unable to fall asleep. He regretted throwing the dog into the river, fearing it would cause more trouble. He remembered getting a beating for Mr. Gutman's poodle and nearly getting one for Mrs. de Beer's cat, only to have Le Fu wrongly blamed, even though he was the culprit. He knew that although Knox had been stabbed today, it wasn't a big deal. Tomorrow morning, as soon as the sun rose, he was sure to resume his charitable work by the river. Once he picked up the foxhound's corpse, there would undoubtedly be more trouble for him to bear. Peng Qi, knowing himself, would never get up early in the morning. It would be better to sneak down to the river under the cover of darkness, use a hayfork to lift the dog's corpse, and hide or bury it. Then there would be no problem.

### From the High Cost of Everything to A Laboring Family

— Fu Yun

Everyone relies on the cooperative effort of their own hands to build a happy family

In this time of soaring prices and expensive clothing, food, housing, and daily necessities, the residents of the isolated island, especially those who escaped the "August 13th" artillery fire, are living a precarious existence. Faced with such unsustainable conditions, everyone cries out, "Life is hard!" As a result, many who have already rented houses are seeking refuge in refugee self-sufficiency centers due to rising rents and expensive daily necessities (even the thatched huts in the western suburbs of Shanghai, where the annual land rent used to be one yuan, now rent for three to five yuan a month). (The self-sufficiency centers require individuals to buy their own meals. Currently, the Relief Association at the Second Shelter on Yanping Road sells white rice at three cents per pound, or refugees can buy their own rice and cook it themselves.) At the same time, refugees who have found suitable work within the shelters, earning enough to support a family of three or four, cannot leave refugee life immediately because they cannot afford the rent.

Someone once said, "In a famine, the lazy starve to death." This is certainly true. Not just today, when affected by war, but even in peaceful times, if a person is lazy and seeks only comfort, procrastinating and sitting idle, even if they have some savings, they will eventually eat it all away. In the past, those who lived in war zones suffered the devastation of artillery fire, with families broken and lives lost. Relatives and friends who lived in the same war zones also scattered and lost their livelihoods. If they don't find their own way out, who can they rely on? The author is also a refugee who used to live in a war zone. In the past two years, I have seen many refugees who escaped from war zones with nothing to their name, first entering shelters, where entire families lived as refugees. Later, they found their own means of survival and work, and now they have all escaped refugee life. Among these people, I would like to highlight the family of my friend, Mr. Yu. All six members of his family work and contribute. Through their united cooperation and individual efforts in their respective production work, they still maintain the joy of a happy family reunion in this environment of high living costs. This is truly commendable! Mr. Yu's father passed away several years ago. He was a scholar, and based on his own experiences, he felt that the life of a scholar who relies on writing was unreliable. Therefore, he decided that his sons should become workers, relying on their skills and labor to earn a living. So, Mr. Yu's brothers all became workers. Mr. Yu was originally an electrician and ran an electrical supply store in Nanshi before the war, working as a boss. During the "August 13th" battle, all six members of his family (his elderly mother, wife, sister, brother, sister-in-law, and himself) entered a shelter. The brother, sister, wife, and sister-in-law all took on service work within the shelter. Last year, they left refugee life and found a house for twelve yuan a month. His family's expenses are covered by a system of collective support and shared responsibilities. His brother, who is a coppersmith, earns twenty yuan a month and is responsible for the twelve yuan monthly rent. His wife and sister work in a cloth factory, each earning between one and twenty yuan a month, and each contributes six yuan to the household for food (Mr. Yu's brother, sister-in-law, and himself do not eat at home). His sister-in-law lives at the factory and comes home once a week, bringing back cooked dishes, and contributes four yuan to the household each month. Mr. Yu himself works in an electrical supply store, earning over twenty yuan a month, and is responsible for daily groceries. Cooking, laundry, and all household chores are done cooperatively. His elderly mother, in addition to managing household affairs, also helps with sewing from time to time. Their family's clothes do not require paying a tailor. Recently, Mr. Yu also took on a job at a machine factory, co-founded by his friend. This kind of family, everyone relies on their own labor to make a living, sharing all expenses, has become a very happy family. From this, it can be further proved that "unity" and "effort" will give us a satisfactory answer.

### "A Humble Old Man on the Vast Earth"

— Yu Tieqi

Not long ago, I saw a news item in the newspaper that Mr. Fen Weng was going to hold a solo exhibition of calligraphy and seal carving. I was so impressed by the achievements of this eccentric figure in the art world that I tried to find out his address and boldly paid him a visit.

I had heard some strange stories about Mr. Fen Weng's unique personality, so when I arrived at his door, my footsteps faltered. But after an hour of conversation, the rumors proved to be untrue. Mr. Fen Weng was not the kind of person I had imagined, who flaunted his own style with bizarre behavior. On the contrary, from his sincerity, candor, and lack of self-satisfaction, one could see that he was brimming with the demeanor of an artist with decades of rigorous practice.

When I was led into the room where Mr. Fen Weng creates his art, he had just finished writing a handscroll in the cursive style of Huai Su. The handscroll was more than forty feet long, a rare masterpiece. The brushstrokes were full of vigor and flowing freely (that handscroll was also one of the exhibits in the upcoming Fen Weng solo exhibition).

Mr. Fen Weng was resting after writing. He had a cigarette in his hand, a few strands of white hair drifted from his forehead, and his body reclined on the sofa, seemingly lost in thought. He invited me to sit down and answered a series of questions I had prepared in advance. It is said that since he participated in the Cup Water Exhibition last summer, many people who loved his calligraphy and seal carving had urged him to hold a solo exhibition. But because he was preparing to open the Ce Jian Lou Jin Shi Painting and Calligraphy Lecture, he was busy writing lecture notes, and only had free time this spring. So he actively engaged in the preparations for the current solo exhibition. It is now decided that from June 28th to July 2nd, the painting and seal carving solo exhibition will be held for five consecutive days on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company on Yuchaqing Road. Admission is free, and all are welcome to visit. A total of more than two hundred pieces are on display, as well as more than a hundred fan surfaces. During the solo exhibition, there will be special carving rates: stone seals are eight yuan per seal, and ivory seals are twelve yuan per seal, which is much cheaper than the original price.

Speaking of seals, Mr. Fen Weng has been immersed in this art for almost thirty years. He initially had no teacher, but he extensively studied the works of the Zhejiang School. Because of the rigor of the seal script, his works do not veer into wildness despite their grandeur. Later, he became a student of Zhao Guni of Yushan and fully inherited his mantle. That old Mr. Zhao was the leading seal carver of his generation after the death of Changshuo Wu. After Mr. Zhao also passed away, Mr. Fen Weng accepted his tradition. In recent years, Mr. Fen Weng has devoted himself to imitating the official and private seals of the Han Dynasty, so his works have become more and more imbued with a simple and vigorous spirit. It is said that a scroll of Han Dynasty royal seals that he has personally copied will also be displayed in the current solo exhibition.

Regarding Mr. Fen Weng's superb artistry, I will only copy a poem sent to him by the party and state elder, Bai Wenwei, as the conclusion to this article. It reads: "The spirit of the Han and Wei dynasties, the atmosphere of the Tang and Song dynasties, poetry, calligraphy, gold, and stone are all outstanding achievements. The ancients did not see the cold mountains and rivers, the vast earth is a humble old man."

Chapter Thirteen: Encourage Learning, Promote Agriculture, and Store Resources for the Nation; Retain the Strong and Eliminate the Weak, Select Seeds with Fields

It is said that everyone who was a friend of Zhao Letian knew about the love story between Zhao Letian and Pan Peiying. Village Chief Zhu had worked with Zhao Letian before and was considered an old friend, so he naturally knew everything. By the time Zhao Letian and Pan Peiying got married, the Sino-Japanese War had been settled. Zhao Letian's father liked excitement and understood that Pan Peiying sincerely loved his son, and after receiving news of his death in battle, she remained chaste and did not marry. Now that the two were finally united in marriage, he held a grand feast. Many friends spread the word, considering it a beautiful story, and Zhu Aiqun probably heard it from her grand-uncle, Village Chief Zhu. However, Aiqun probably didn't know the details, so the author has recounted the events of Zhao and Pan in detail. At the time, Village Chief Zhu smiled and said, "Our Village Chief Xu is still strong and vigorous in his old age, a withered poplar growing ladders, which is a rare thing in the world. Even he himself probably thinks it's unexpected, right? As for Zhao Letian, that's another matter. He's still in his prime. Although there's a love story involved, he still sows the cause first and reaps the result later. Because there are some ups and downs in the story, it's very much like a romantic novel, so people call it a love story. But it's not as if people admire his one leg, and specifically want to choose a man with one leg as their son-in-law. However, I feel very comfortable now, too. People should take a step back and be content with everything. As the ancients said, 'Contentment brings happiness,' and I really admire this saying. You see, since ancient times, many earth-shattering events have been caused by not being content. Why are there aggressors? It's because of a lack of contentment in their hearts, which has invaded them. At that time, they are ambitious, feeling that occupying a little of someone else's territory is good. Naturally, others are not willing to give in, so disputes and killings arise. Therefore, whether it's a large country or a small individual, it's all the same. In the past, because others came to invade and bully us, we naturally had to resist. Fortunately, in the end, our sacrifice was not in vain. We protected our land and safeguarded our sovereignty, without losing a single bit. We don't want to invade others, but we won't let others invade us either. If someone wants to attack me, I will honestly and without hesitation strike back, which is called 'striking the attacker with a strike.' At this moment, we still live and work in peace, restoring our freedom, and being ordinary people. My age is almost up, and I didn't die at that time, but only lost an arm, which is considered a blessing. The years that follow are my remaining life. So when I think about it, Zhao Letian's name is Letian, and if I were to change my name, I should be called Yusheng [Remaining Life]!" (145)

### Mr. Zhang Shutong's Running Script

### Why Must One Believe in Jesus? (1) Because All People Have Sinned

— Wu

The scripture says, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." It also says, "And are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus." In these two passages, we are clearly told why people need to believe in Jesus, and we are made to recognize that God is absolutely just. He neither deceives the poor nor favors the rich; he has confined all the people in the world to sin, and you and I are included. Whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, male or female, old or young, rich or poor, everyone has committed the sin of falling short of the glory of God; because the universe and all things were created by God, and the lives, actions, and existence of us human beings are also in His hands. Gentlemen! God has given you the breath of life... and given you the joy of enjoying nature. May I ask: Do you have gratitude in your heart? Do you praise Him with your mouth? If not! That is committing sin, falling short of the glory of God, just like a daughter's unfilial and disobedient treatment of her parents, a sin that is so deep. According to God's law, the retribution for sin is death. But God forbears the destruction of the world and establishes a way of salvation for sin. As it says in the scripture above: "And are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus." Therefore, the sins we have committed in our lives are forgiven through the redemption of Jesus Christ on the cross, and we are transferred from the status of sinners to the status of the righteous, and we are reconciled to God, like a father and son reuniting and living a life of mutual understanding.

The Arts

### Watching Mao Shilai and Others Perform "Nanjie Pass"

— Su Shaoqing

Mao Shilai's second engagement at the Golden Theatre shows great improvement compared to before. I watched his "Xin An Zhou" some time ago, and although it was beautiful, it was not perfect. I wrote an article hoping that he would work hard on the "fierce" aspect of his performance. On June 20th, I watched his "Nanjie Pass" again. This play is the pinnacle of his performances. Why? Shilai's only concern is his inability to be fierce. Now, in this play, he can be "fierce." Moreover, it is a grand play, so what else could it be but a masterpiece? First, let me describe the story of "Nanjie Pass," and then I will give a detailed commentary.

The Later Zhou Dynasty ordered Zhao Kuangyin to invade the Southern Tang Dynasty. Liu Renzhan, the chief general of Shouzhou, and his wife, Xu Jinhua, firmly defended the city without surrendering. Liu was injured by a sword and recuperating, so his concubine, Hua Yingchun, took the opportunity to have an affair with the adjutant, He Yanxi, and stole the command to surrender the city to the enemy. The city fell, Liu was captured, and Xu, carrying her young son, fought her way into the enemy camp. There, she met her husband and personally killed the adulterer and adulteress.

Shilai plays Xu Jinhua. Her opening fight and patrolling of the city are exceptionally impressive, with amazing stilt skills (leaping, running, shuffling steps, setbacks, walking in circles, all kinds of tricks, one after another), fast and fierce. Her postures and poses are also worth seeing. The city patrolling scene involves singing Kunqu Opera while dancing, which is very demanding. However, her low voice is not yet developed and still needs hard work. The Xipi Yuanban in the appreciating chrysanthemums scene proves that she has mastered popular tunes, so there is hope for her singing in the future.

The scenes of this play are quite tight, and the critical moments are wonderful. The words of the script are also worth appreciating. It seems to be adapted from a Kunqu Opera romance, with loyalty and value. Shilai and others perform with great effort, which can make money and make them popular. Along with "Jiangyou Pass" and "Xun Guan Niang," it is a good historical play that should be promoted more. In the peeping scene, when speaking to the concubine, she suddenly adds a lot of Pekingese dialect. This is an innovation, probably because it is a very good play, and she is afraid that the audience cannot fully understand the rhyming language, so she suddenly changed to Pekingese dialect?

In this play, Shilai has one part that seems inappropriate. When returning to the mansion after patrolling the city, Madam Xu sees enemy soldiers capturing her husband and draws her sword as if to fight, saying, "Watch my sword!" But the enemy soldiers ignore her and leave. The Madam has no choice but to put her sword back in its sheath. This section has no outcome and should be changed. In my opinion, it should be changed to the enemy soldiers leaving, and the Madam drawing her sword and shouting, "I should chase and save my husband, but I am outnumbered, and I must protect my young son. I will return to the mansion to save my son and then make a plan." I wonder if that would be good?

On this day, Shilai performed with particular effort. There were one or two places where she used too much force and almost made a mistake. Some people will surely advise her not to be too fierce in the future, in order to be safe. I don't agree. This is a manifestation of vigor. Let young people have some fire, even if there are some slips, it doesn't matter. With more experience, they will naturally become stable. If you always want to be safe, then you are close to lukewarm, and lukewarm makes it difficult to progress. (The above is about Mao Shilai)

Gao Shenglin plays Gao Huailiang. His entrance and martial skills are all good. Guan Shengxi plays Zhao Kuangyin. His singing and dialogue are solid, but his low voice is a little weak. Sha Shixin plays Liu Renzhan adequately. In two or three years, when his voice comes out, he will surely become popular. Ai Shiju plays Liu Yanxi. He has the scope of the old "square scarf" role, and is good at jump-opening. His low voice, which is not clear and loud, is a defect.

Finally, I should talk about the Kun corner of Yu Sulian, who plays Liu's concubine. Her art of flirting is extraordinary. Yu Sulian is a natural material for a flower girl. Her face, features, and skin are all excellent. She is willing to do amorous things and is able to do them well. Although her voice is not loud, it is extremely clear and round. In this play, she plays Hua Yingchun, secretly meeting Yanxi in his bedroom. After seeing him, she feigns a change of heart, gradually offering wine to the lover, and gradually leading him offstage. When Madam Xu calls at the door, her appearance is wonderfully charming, truly willing to do it and able to do it. It was obvious to everyone that day, and I cannot describe it in detail, lest I commit the sin of lewd words.

In short, this play has two scenes of flirting interspersed, so everyone likes to watch it, and Yu Sulian is able to do it well, so the whole play is lively.

### Impressions of the Drama Performance to Raise Funds by the Dancers' Mutual Aid Society

— Zhihua

The sisters of the dance industry performed a one-act play called "Dancer's Tears" last year, which I saw. It was a collective creation, and although it lacked writing experience, the truth of life made the writing techniques seem important. This is a groan of the weak, but this groan is magnificent, and this is the beginning of self-awareness.

This year they will perform again. The plays are two: "Dancer's Tears" and "A Dancer in Shanghai." Both are one-act plays, probably due to time and other limitations. "A Dancer in Shanghai" was written several years before "Dancer's Tears." It describes the unfortunate encounters of a dancer in a "corner of the metropolis." The play is a sketch, but here it explains to us one of the social reasons for the creation of dancers. From the performances I have seen several times, they all have good stage effects.

"A Dancer in Shanghai" illustrates that a girl who has lost her hometown in Mongolia can only earn a living in this society through her sexuality, and her lover is sent to the police station for failing to withstand the exploitation of high-interest loans. "Dancer's Tears," while still a groan of the weak, is already the cry of the dancers after self-awareness. As for "Tears of Flowers," it is there that we see Dingxiang. They have self-esteem from self-awareness: "We are dancers, free professional women; we are dancers, citizens of the Republic of China." And they clearly see this scene, the sky full of wind and clouds!

The purpose of this performance is to raise funds, which means that they have realized the importance of group power. "One bamboo pole is easy to break, three cotton threads are hard to pull apart." Especially the weak who are insulted and harmed, they must have a group to back them up. At the same time, they are already members of this group, and only then will they have security. And the most important purpose, they want to be a "person," a dignified person!

No one can stop the giant wheels of the times. If you don't follow it, you can only be crushed under its wheels. And next year, in addition to "A Dancer in Shanghai," "Dancer's Tears," and "Tears of Flowers," there will definitely be new plays about the lives of dancers. Inside, there will be more Dingxiangs, and even Mimi and Gu Xiaomei will become more active. They will be as strong as steel in a ring. (Charity Sale for Funds)

### Hou Yulan's Theatrical Life

— Bosheng

Coming to Shanghai for Sightseeing and Experience, Her Theatrical Skills are Improving Day by Day, and Her Hopes are Endless.

Following Mao Shilai, the Golden Theatre has hired the Tan-style old male role actor, Yan Jupeng, to come south. Hou Yulan also came with him, as reported in this newspaper earlier. Recently, Yulan has performed with the famous old male role actor, Xi Xiaobo, in Beijing. It was still the first decision. On the first day of performing in Huale Garden, the sold-out sign was hung up at eight o'clock, which shows her appeal. Yulan is a senior student of the Peking Opera School. In every school-wide examination, she ranked first. Not only are her theatrical skills outstanding, but her literary foundation is also excellent. She just graduated last winter during the Bathing Buddha Festival at the young age of twenty-one. Her father, Yueting, is an amateur who specializes in the old male role. He is over forty years old and often engages in the life of Pear Garden in Tianjin. Her mother is still alive and only gave birth to Yulan, whom they love dearly. She loved drama since she was a child and once studied with a female actress. At the age of eleven, she played Cai Lou Pei in a private performance. Because of her intelligence and talent, she was encouraged by relatives and friends to study at the opera school. She went on stage in just a few months. The first time she sang "Entering the Palace Twice," and her co-stars were Zhao Deyu and Wang Helin. She was an instant hit and was valued by the school. Yulan is quiet by nature, does not like to dress up, and is devoted to learning art, so her progress is very fast. Since Zhao Jinrong left the school, Yulan has been promoted to be the best. After graduation, some people urged her to form a troupe, but she felt that her academic strength was insufficient, so she stayed at school to observe. The school hired her as an assistant teacher, giving her only fifteen yuan a month, and her daily income from performances was not very high. Yulan said that she was content to be able to provide for her mother, and her filial piety is admirable. Two months ago, her father Fang Nuo brought more than a thousand yuan to make dozens of fashionable clothes for her, waiting for an opportunity to try them out. Other places offered high prices to hire her, but she was unmoved. This time, she came to Shanghai with Jupeng. At first, there were changes. After someone explained to her parents that she was coming to Shanghai for sightseeing and to gain experience, Yulan decided to come with Yan. Here, there is a lack of leading female actors. Yulan can improve her skills day by day, and her future prospects are endless.

### Skating Technique (62)

— Jointly Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen

Four-Sided (Continued)

2.  Second Practice Method: First, use the first body position with one foot completely to make an outward circle. After completing the circle, the guest foot should not land. The main foot continues to use the second body position to overlap the first circle, making a second circle. Each foot should make two circles, forming a double-movement pattern or an 8-shape.

Beginners find this method very difficult, but it will be achieved with practice, and the hard work will not be in vain. After learning the first and second body positions, the third and fourth positions must be learned immediately.

The third position is very useful for advanced skating, such as after an outward backward swing turn, before an outward forward bracket, after an inward backward three-turn, or before an outward forward three-turn.

In the third position, the guest shoulder and arm are in front, the head faces the center of the circle, and the guest leg remains behind. The body from the hips up is the opposite of the first position.

The fourth position, from the waist up, is the opposite of the second position. The guest arm and shoulder are behind, and the guest leg is in front. It must be used after an inward backward three-turn and after an outward backward swing turn.

If these four body positions can be fully understood and used well, then in future free skating competitions and at an advanced level, patterns can be created at will without feeling any difficulty.

2.  Inward progress using the inner edge of the shoe is slightly easier than using the outer edge because the whole body naturally leans inward. However, it is not easy to maintain with one foot, so you must first practice the foot arch so that it does not lean inward and can allow the moving foot to walk independently, and the more you can keep the guest leg behind, the better. For inward progress, the body position from the waist up is the opposite of the outward progress start, because the guest shoulder and guest arm are in front first. When the body starts to rotate, the guest shoulder gently moves back, and the guest leg moves to the front of the main leg and above the main leg (that is, on the arc). At the end of the circle, the main shoulder is in front, the guest arm crosses slightly in front of the body, and the main arm remains behind. At the end of the circle, the body leans slightly outward, and the guest leg must cross the main leg completely, making the guest foot reach outside the circle line to avoid forming a 6-shape.

The difficulty of inward progress lies in taking the first step. The common problem is taking too large a step, and the heel is not easy to turn outward. It is best to keep both feet close together, bend both knees deeply, only touch the edge, and apply force to the heel. There is no need to push hard. The above is based on the first and second body positions. When changing feet, the guest shoulder moves forward first, so that the whole body faces forward instead of sideways.

In the third position, from the waist up, it is the opposite of the first position. The main shoulder is in front, and the guest leg is behind. This position is used before an inward forward three-turn, after an inward backward swing turn, and after an outward backward three-turn.

In the fourth position, from the waist up, it is the opposite of the second position. The guest shoulder, guest arm, and guest leg are in front. The movement of the shoulder is in the rotation of the waist, and the guest foot is on the arc, as in the second position. This position is actually very important because this position must be used for all of the following patterns: the first arc of an inward forward three-turn, after an inward backward swing turn, and after an inward forward bracket. Therefore, the third and fourth positions must be practiced in the same way as the first and second positions.

Today, "Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden" is suspended for one day, and the next issue will be published as usual (Editor).

### Construction of a Wharf on the Bund

According to regulations, the Huangpu Bund Road in the French Concession ends at the Jinliyuan Wharf, and no wharves or warehouses are allowed to be built along the riverbank in order to allow pedestrians to see the river surface and prevent the view from being blocked by the warehouses. Now, Jardine Matheson is planning to build a wharf in the water opposite the road in front of the newly purchased Gongzheng old base warehouse to facilitate the berthing and unloading of its ships traveling to and from Hankou. Once the plan was finalized, it wrote to the French Engineering Department on the one hand and started piling work on the other. This is encroaching on the river boundary. The French believe that the land does not belong to him alone, and the water surface in front of the land can be used by him. However, if this principle is extended, the entire river will belong to the owners of the land along the riverbank.

### Additional Patrol Officer Appointed to the Eight Immortals Bridge

The Eight Immortals Bridge in Xinzha is connected to the foreign concessions and far from the city walls. Due to the difficulty of surveillance, it has always been a place for harboring criminals. After Shen the Investigator dispatched Yuan Sima Shuxun to lead the patrolmen to be stationed at the Great King Temple in Xinzha for patrols at any time, the alternate official Yao Gong was now additionally commissioned to join the patrol.
