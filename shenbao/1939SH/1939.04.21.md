### Editorial: Side View on the French Concession Dispute

Yesterday in the Shanghai French Concession, a dispute suddenly arose between citizens and the police over the flag hanging issue. This newspaper has already commented on the matter yesterday, offering advice to both parties. Looking at the forums in this city, there is a unanimous agreement and shared opinion. In terms of the essence of the issue: compared to the various current problems, it is actually insignificant; if we must analyze the right and wrong, there is also much room for discussion; it is more about emotion and reason. Differing opinions, differing perspectives, either rigid or flexible, understandable or disputable, so those who judge it can also be vastly different. However, everyone expresses their feelings, achieving the same view through different paths, focused on the friendship between China and France, urging that big issues be reduced to small ones, and small issues be resolved without incident; what this reflects is nothing other than "the nation comes first, the people come first, military comes first, victory comes first, concentrate will, concentrate power," which has been forged by twenty-two months of gunfire, forming a common emotion, evolving into a common response, increasingly confirmed by this subtle test. Sound public opinion is the foundation of good governance; this is what the reporter humbly wishes to encourage fellow forum members to work together on in the future. By yesterday evening, the dispute had come to an end, with mutual forgiveness and peace, and there should be no more issues; assuming that there are still disputes, which cannot be abandoned, the seriousness of its nature and the importance of its relationship are still above the disputes of the previous two days, then the issue is no longer between the citizens and the police, leaving it for the supervisors to negotiate and assign responsibility.

There are some uneasiness to remain silent on, please allow me to express it: since the dispute has occurred, rumors and sensitive comments have been circulating in Chinese and foreign societies; some see it as initiated and directed by the Kuomintang, some see it as instigated and incited by the Communist Party; some see this as a sign of the French flattering the strong and suppressing the weak, filled with indignation; some see this as a gradual increase in the ambition of the Chinese, with some trepidation; all these statements seem to be true but are not, and must be refuted. Why do they seem to be true? The dispute arose from the hanging of flags, the hanging of flags arose from the National Spiritual Mobilization, and the Spiritual Mobilization was advocated by the Kuomintang, so the Kuomintang is suspected of initiating and directing the dispute. In the past, the Communist Party often supported class boycotts, work strikes, and market strikes, and this time some shops closed, which is close to market strikes, and some even deliberately vaguely waved the banner of communism, so the Communist Party is suspected of instigating and inciting the dispute. The reason given by the police for banning the hanging of flags, whether it stands up or not, is set aside for now, but for direct action against the flag of a country, its hasty issuance cannot be denied, but why was it done, suspected of being out of fear of the environment, so it is hated as flattering the strong and suppressing the weak. China's war of resistance has a belief in certain victory, but in the middle of the war, on the isolated island of complete preservation, it still likes to contend with the concession authorities, suspected of being the aftermath of the belief in certain victory, so it is hated as being ambitious and high-spirited. Those who falsely accuse the Kuomintang of initiating and directing, and falsely accuse the Communist Party of instigating and inciting, are plotting to destroy the two parties; those who falsely accuse the French of flattering the strong and suppressing the weak, and falsely accuse the Chinese of being ambitious and high-spirited, are plotting to alienate the two countries; they falsely accuse with a purpose.

How do we know it is false? Parties have party strategies, and countries have national policies, and all measures of this party and this country must be followed as the norm. Those who contradict them are either not members of this party or not citizens of this country; even if they are members of that party or citizens of that country, they cannot be seen as representing their party or country. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China are now dedicated to the war of resistance and nation-building: in terms of nation-building and production, and in terms of the "nation comes first, the people come first, military comes first, victory comes first, concentrate will, concentrate power" of the war of resistance, they definitely do not want to see disputes, let alone create disputes; they definitely do not want to talk about business closures, let alone instigate market strikes. The dispute is due to unwillingness to accept hasty direct actions, and the business closures are due to negative emotions after encountering stimulation, so what does it have to do with the Kuomintang and the Communist Party? In matters involving international relations, on the French side, they are working with the British to promote unity against aggression, taking support of the weak and defense against the tyrannical as their national policy, so how can it be said that they have the intention of flattering the strong and suppressing the weak? On the Chinese side, not only in the midst of the war of resistance have they repeatedly declared the righteousness of friendship and enmity, seeking friends for fear of not getting them: in addition to the enemy, why would there be any other conflicts between countries, or friction between people, why would they care about disputes, which would cause pain to loved ones and joy to enemies? Not only that, but China's war of resistance is subjectively for self-defense, and objectively for the common interests of friendly countries in the Far East; after the victory of the war of resistance, whether it is to restore the wounds, revitalize the people's livelihood, to develop agriculture and mining, for all construction, for international trade, it is all the more necessary for the talents and materials of friendly countries to go to the great cause together; and before, during, and after the war, what China will always share with friendly countries is the unwavering adherence to all international treaties; China's relationship of shared hardships and blessings with its friendly countries is like this, so how can it be said that it would alienate friendly countries with an ambitious and high-spirited attitude? Those who falsely accuse China of this are plotting to make the international community worry that China will not be conducive to the interests of all countries after the victory of the war of resistance, plotting to make the international community reduce its sympathy for China's war of resistance, and the dispute in the Shanghai French Concession yesterday and today is a perfect pretext for them to sow discord between China and foreign countries. Do not believe it lightly, but it is even better to cherish it!

### British Firmly Denies Mediation in the Sino-Japanese War; China Continues the War of Resistance and Will Never Accept Peace Talks

(London) British authorities hereby declare that the claim in Japanese newspapers that Britain has offered to mediate the Sino-Japanese War is absolutely untrue. (20th Reuters)

(Chongqing) Chinese newspapers here are paying great attention to the European situation, especially emphasizing the impact of the European situation on China. The core of general comments is to declare that China cannot allow events in other parts of the world to affect its determination to continue the war of resistance. Holding this belief, China does not want to hear any suggestions from foreign countries, unless the suggestion meets the demands and needs of the Chinese people. Such opinions generally believe that Chairman Chiang's speech the other day also declared that China has no intention of making peace at the moment. Regarding the question of whether a conflict in Europe would benefit China, most comments believe that it would not benefit China unless the United States and the Soviet Union all participate in the war.

Japanese troops in Xinjiang repeatedly tried to come out of the city to provide cover for road repairs but were repelled by the Chinese army. (19th dispatch)

Tongguan: Japanese cavalry commander Kiku Saburo was killed by the Chinese army in the battle of Anyun. Furthermore, because of the Chinese army's siege of Yuncheng, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses and burned down most of the houses of villagers in the upper section, massacring over 130 villagers.

Yu Ji: Over the past week, the fighting in Shanxi province has been particularly intense in the Zhongyang-Lishi area. The city gates of Lishi and Zhongyang were once occupied by the Chinese army, and the Japanese bunkers were completely destroyed. The Japanese suffered heavy losses and have become more cautious, holding onto their strongholds and refraining from reckless actions. In the Shuo County, Pinglu, and Shenchi areas of northwestern Shanxi, Japanese troops have also been active in the past week. From Pinglu, 1,000 Japanese troops were transferred from Datong to join the Japanese troops in Shuo County and launch another westward attack on Qingshui River. Japanese troops in Shenchi launched attacks on Wuzhai by multiple routes, attempting to occupy Zhailan. However, they were intercepted by various Chinese forces. Only the Japanese troops in Shenchi briefly invaded Wuzhai, but they were quickly defeated by the Chinese army and fled back to Shenchi. Japanese troops in Dagu, Yuci, Qixian, Pingyao, and Jiexiu attempted to move southeast, but the Chinese army is closely monitoring them. Around 5,000 to 6,000 Japanese troops invaded Qinyuan from Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Lingshi, with heavy fighting occurring in Wanghezhen and Wangtao. The two sides are still locked in a stalemate on that line. There has been no major contact in the Linfen East and West Fushan and Anze area in the past week. Only a unit of Japanese troops in Heilongguan fled east to Tumen, where they were intercepted by the Chinese army and suffered dozens of casualties. In southern Shanxi, Yangshepo, Cuijiahe, and Guoniubao, southeast of Wenxi, have been recaptured by the Chinese army. Paoshanzhuang has also been occupied by the Chinese forces. Zhangdian, southeast of Yi, and Shiling, south of Jiexian, have been besieged by the Chinese army several times, and the Japanese troops have suffered considerable losses. A unit of the Chinese army has also advanced into Yuxiang, cutting off communications from Hengling Pass. Currently, the Japanese forces are unable to coordinate effectively, and the Chinese war situation is developing smoothly. (19th dispatch)

### Puppet Municipal Government Established in Hankou; Zhang Qingfu Appointed as Puppet Mayor

(Hankou) The "Hankou Municipal Government" was formally established this morning at 11 a.m. Zhang Qingfu (transliteration) assumed the position of "Mayor." (All Europeans in Hankou, including journalists, were not invited to attend. Special martial law was declared in the area a quarter of a mile surrounding the location of the establishment ceremony. All guests were searched. Afterwards, a "citizen's parade" was held, but the unfavorable weather made the parade appear even more pathetic in the bleak wind and rain. In the afternoon, the newly appointed "Mayor" hosted a banquet at the park, inviting approximately 1,500 guests.) (30th Reuters dispatch)

### Collective Security System to Be Extended to the East; Organizational Procedure Consists of Three Steps; British Prime Minister Hints in the House of Commons Yesterday

(London) The "Yorkshire Post," the organ of former Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, known for its well-informed sources, published an article today stating that the anti-aggression line initiated by the British government may be extended to the Far East. "Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi previously met with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax on the 18th of this month and held a "preliminary discussion" on this issue." According to general knowledge, the current anti-aggression line organization procedure consists of three steps: (1) The United Kingdom and France provide guarantees to Poland, Greece, and Romania, which has already been accomplished. (2) The United Kingdom intends to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union, which is about to be completed. (3) The collective security system will be extended to the Far East. (20th Havas dispatch)

(London) Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons yesterday, in response to a question from Labour Party leader Clement Attlee, that the government intends to include China and other countries in the Far East in any group resisting aggression, has attracted considerable attention from political figures here. According to information obtained by Reuters, Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Guo Taiqi had held preliminary discussions with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Under-Secretary of State R.A. Butler on this matter before Attlee raised the question. Both Halifax and Butler expressed sympathy. It is said that if Attlee had not raised this question, other members of the House of Commons would have done so. It seems to be believed that China's joining the anti-aggression group of nations will be the third stage, as negotiations including the Soviet Union must first be completed. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi told Reuters, "Some people may think that including China in the anti-aggression group is like locking the stable door after the horse has bolted, but we Chinese have a proverb that it is never too late to mend. What we need to consider is the future." The Yorkshire Post stated that the Far East and Europe cannot be regarded as watertight compartments. The existence of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo triangle reminds us that we must take this into account. Therefore, on the same day that President Roosevelt sent a peace appeal to Hitler and Mussolini, he made the decision to concentrate the American fleet in the Pacific. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi will attend a banquet at the invitation of the Manchester Reform Club tomorrow at noon, where he will deliver a speech. In the evening, he will speak in Derby, and on April 22, he will speak in Bolton. (20th Reuters dispatch)

### Chinese Official Expresses Welcome

(Chongqing) The government welcomes reports from London that China may be invited to join the anti-aggression line. Informed sources believe that this shows that Britain and France are not entirely focused on Europe. "Peace is still uncertain, and war in any part of the world will affect all regions. Peace must be universal to be effective. Some people believe that China's situation is different because the war is already underway. In fact, a joint anti-aggression policy of the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States could force Japan to yield within three to six months. The anti-aggression policy should include an economic blockade against Japan, refusing to sell war necessities to Japan, refusing to buy Japanese goods, and actively assisting China. These actions would not lead to war between the great powers and Japan." At the same time, government officials said that to make the anti-aggression line effective, China must be included, as Japan is also one of the Axis powers. The concerted actions of Japan, Italy, and Germany, along with aggressive actions in different parts of the world depending on the situation, resulted in Britain and France gaining an anti-aggression partner in the Far East, helping to end the war and preventing the dispersal of forces.

### U.S. President's Peace Appeal Emphasizes Both Europe and Asia; Ambassador Guo Expresses Satisfaction

(London) Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Guo Taiqi spoke at a luncheon of the British and North American Press today, expressing satisfaction with President Roosevelt's peace appeal, which equally and sincerely referred to Asia as well as Europe. Ambassador Guo further stated earnestly that China's struggle is for international political stability and democracy, and to prevent the Asian members of the Axis powers from spreading elsewhere. If China were to waver, it would make the world's progress appear fragmented. (19th Reuters dispatch)

### Premier Kong Expresses Thoughts on Roosevelt's Peace Appeal; Japan's Aggression Against China Affects the World; Hopes the Great American Plan Can Be Realized

(Chongqing) When asked for his opinion yesterday on President Roosevelt's peace appeal to Europe, Premier Kong expressed the following thoughts:

"President Roosevelt's note to the German leader and the note conveyed by Secretary of State Hull to the Italian Prime Minister can be described as the most important documents in modern international relations. With far-sightedness, President Roosevelt called for peace for all mankind, inviting the responsible authorities of various countries to guarantee non-aggression against other countries at a time when the situation in Europe is most critical, and prepared for discussions on disarmament and economic issues. His intention is bright and forthright, and his courage is great and profound, truly in line with the lofty ideals of the American people. All who love peace admire him. China is resisting Japan's military aggression, which has already begun the Second World War. The impact of this war is not limited to China alone, but is detrimental to all parts of the world, with the countries most closely related to China suffering the most. If a European war unfortunately breaks out while Japan's aggression continues, the flames of war will spread throughout the Eastern Hemisphere, becoming an unstoppable prairie fire, and the devastation will be unimaginable. This is what is meant by the indivisibility of peace. If all countries in the world can simultaneously provide the guarantees proposed by President Roosevelt, mankind can once again see the dawn. We deeply hope that President Roosevelt's great plan can succeed, laying the foundation for world peace." (20th dispatch)

### Hu Shi Meets with Roosevelt to Discuss the Far East Situation; U.S. Indicates No Intention to Send a Note to Japan; Willing to Participate in Far East Conference

(Washington) Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shi met with President Roosevelt this morning. According to Ambassador Hu, they discussed the general situation in the Far East. (19th Reuters dispatch)

(Washington) The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun once reported that President Roosevelt intends to send a note to the Japanese government, the content of which may be similar to the cables sent to the German and Italian authorities. When this was inquired of senior officials of the State Department, the response was that the United States has long been prepared to participate in any international conference held by Japan and the countries concerned that intends to resolve the current disputes in the Far East. The U.S. government previously proposed convening such a conference in a note to Japan on December 31 of last year, but has not yet received a response. Currently, both the White House and the State Department say that President Roosevelt may not send a note to Japan. (19th Havas dispatch)

### Japanese Diplomacy Wandering Aimlessly; Hiranuma Meets with Konoe to Exchange Important Opinions

(Hong Kong) A dispatch from Tokyo reports that Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma met with Konoe in a separate room after the regular Privy Council meeting at 11 a.m. on the 19th for an important conversation lasting approximately 30 minutes. This was a continuation of the meeting between the Prime Minister and the President of the Privy Council on March 29, during which they exchanged opinions on Japan's diplomatic measures in response to the recent European situation. (19th dispatch)

Japan's diplomatic policy is currently wandering aimlessly. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, its foreign policy has been quite uncertain. To this day, whether to unite with the fascist powers of Germany and Italy or to get closer to the democratic countries has reached the final decision-making stage, and there is no room for further hesitation. Japan has many difficult factors both domestically and abroad in establishing its diplomatic policy. The military faction advocates strengthening the anti-communist axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy, while the diplomatic circle believes that it is more advantageous for Japan to get closer to the democratic countries, otherwise it may be on a path to suicide. Recently, several Tokyo newspapers, such as the Asahi Shimbun, have discussed future diplomatic policies, arguing that Japan's foreign policy needs to be redetermined due to the development of the "China Incident." Japan may as well cooperate with Britain, France, and the United States while using the anti-communist axis as a basis. Since the Nine-Power Treaty has essentially become a dead letter, there is no need to declare its abolition. In short, Japan's diplomatic direction is currently open to appropriate choices. Forming a united front with Germany and Italy is certainly one method, but unless Germany and Italy have a firm grasp on victory in a future war, Japan cannot take this path. A change in Japan's diplomatic policy seems not impossible. (Translated by Express News Agency from Continental News)

### Japan Occupying the Xin Nan Islands; Not for Military Strategic Purposes; Statement by Spokesman of Japanese Naval Ministry; Intended to Show Calm in Response to U.S. Fleet's Westward Transfer

(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Naval Ministry told reporters today that the Japanese Navy has no intention of expanding its defense line to the Xin Nan Islands or actively using the islands for military strategic purposes. The Xin Nan Islands are mostly dangerous reefs and do not have much military value, which is why no one occupied them before Japan occupied them in 1917. The islands do not have the convenience of providing water and landing sites for seaplanes. The largest island is only 1,300 meters long and 300 meters wide. Around 1918, when the Japanese began collecting seabird guano for fertilizer and mining phosphate, they discovered some Chinese fishermen fishing there, but no Chinese people lived on the islands.

Norfolk: At 6:35 this morning, the U.S. fleet, led by battleships, left Hampton Roads, intending to pass through the Panama Canal to the Pacific. Furthermore, the Commander-in-Chief of the fleet, Claude Bloch, arrived here yesterday. He held a special secret meeting with his subordinates before the fleet departed. (20th Associated Press dispatch)

(Tokyo) Congressional circles in Washington claimed that the U.S. fleet's transfer to the Pacific was a warning to Japan's southward expansion. Today, the Naval Ministry here remained silent on this issue. A spokesman for the Japanese Naval Ministry told reporters that Japan is not concerned about the U.S. fleet's transfer to the Pacific, stating that this move is merely the fleet returning to its original base. However, he did not mention that the fleet's departure from the Atlantic was two months earlier than originally planned. The spokesman also said that Japan has no intention of using its recently occupied Xin Nan Islands as a defense base. The islands have no strategic value, which is why the great powers did not develop them in the past. (20th Associated Press dispatch)

### Mussolini's Speech; Asks U.S. Not to Interfere in European Affairs; Says Axis Powers Are Working for Peace; Unwilling to Be in the Defendant's Seat Listening to Others' Judgments

(Rome) At 11:30 this morning, Mussolini delivered a speech to workers in the Caesar Hall in the Campo de' Fiori, the capital of the ancient Roman Empire. He effectively rejected President Roosevelt's request that totalitarian countries guarantee peace, insisting that Italy and Germany are working for peace and hoping not to be interfered with. He stated, "It is meaningless to place the Axis powers in the defendant's seat. We answer this message with the statement that Italy and Germany are working for peace. We do not want to attack anyone. We want others not to interfere, so that we can work for peace." Mussolini denounced the "hysteria among certain countries behind the Alps," repeatedly stating that today's gathering is peaceful, so there is no reason to be alarmed. He continued, "Italy currently has 15,000 workers busy building the World's Fair site. If we wanted to light the fuse of an explosion, we would not concentrate our efforts on this kind of work." Campo de' Fiori is the site of the 1942 Rome World's Fair. He said the Campo de' Fiori ceremony represents the following points: "First, it is a great mobilization. People outside the country should not be alarmed by this statement. This is a mobilization for peace, with no connection to weapons. This is a mobilization of 15,000 workers. If we wanted to light the fuse of an explosion, if we were preparing a scheme of threats and aggression, we would certainly not devote ourselves to this large-scale work of organizing a World's Fair. If we had a scheme of aggression, we would not invite various countries to participate in this fair. If we still dare to persist in continuing our work under these dark clouds, this should be an indication that we do not want to attack any country. We only want to be able to continue our work. It is extremely unfair and, in a sense, unreasonable to place the Axis powers in the defendant's seat. Regarding the proposed meeting, the United States will still be the distant observer it has always been in the meeting. Experience has given us a painful lesson. The more people there are in the meeting, the more certain it is to fail. Whether or not we will respond to this famous message, I do not want to miss this opportunity to reaffirm that the Axis policy is a policy of peace and cooperation. Italy and Germany have provided much evidence of this. It is time for the spreaders of terror rumors, the prophets of doom, and the specialists in fatalism to remain silent. These kinds of people often cover up their fears, their insane resentment, and their unspeakable interest in the banner. In any case, we must not be moved by the propagation of newspapers, the idle talk of drunkards, or the messianic messages." (20th Associated Press dispatch)

(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech today has been welcomed by political figures here. It is said that the language used by Mussolini this time is completely different from before. Although he did not explicitly respond to President Roosevelt's telegram, he reiterated that Germany and Italy value peace and international cooperation. (20th Havas dispatch)

### The Peace Aggression Front Confronts: European Diplomacy's Intrigues, the Soviet Union's Pivotal Position, Requesting British and French Aid if the Far East is Threatened, Germany and Italy Actively Woo Smaller Nations to Enhance the Berlin-Rome Axis Power

(London) The Times' diplomatic correspondent states that as the world awaits Hitler's response to President Roosevelt's peace appeal, monarchs, heads of state, and diplomats are constantly traveling back and forth, making this an unprecedentedly busy time internationally. These exchanges can be divided into three categories: First, the Anglo-French alliance extending to Moscow and Ankara, with several branches developing from Poland and crossing the Balkan Peninsula, can now be seen as progressing well. Second, secret negotiations between Germany and Italy, which are easier to conduct because Hitler's birthday, a magnet for guests from Central and Southeastern Europe, is being celebrated today. Third, another Italian initiative, which does not necessarily fall entirely within the German-Italian plan. For example, the obvious contact between Rome and Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki, and the discreet negotiations with the Yugoslav government in its capital, are examples of this. (Reuters, 20th)

(London) This morning, newspapers carried news of imminent new Soviet actions. According to the News Chronicle, Stalin summoned the ambassadors to Britain, France, and Germany, as well as the minister to Sweden, to return home to report on their duties. These four diplomats will arrive in Moscow today to attend a meeting to discuss the Soviet Union's attitude towards concluding a treaty with the Western powers. When the ambassadors to France and Germany passed through Poland on their way home, they reportedly met with the chargé d'affaires and listened to his views on Poland's attitude toward cooperation with the Soviet Union. A Paris dispatch in the Daily Mail states that the Soviet Union will demand that Britain and France provide support to the Soviet Union in the event of a Japanese attack, as a condition for Soviet cooperation with Britain and France to jointly resist aggression in Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, a Warsaw dispatch in The Times reports that Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov recently sought to inquire whether Balkan diplomatic authorities would welcome Soviet assistance if their independence were threatened, and what form such assistance should take. Regardless of the above or other developments arising from the Soviet Union's significant new activities in European affairs, commentators in the morning papers believe that Anglo-French contacts with various countries are now making good progress.

### Anglo-Turkish Anti-Aggression Negotiations Successful: Compromise Reached in Principle

(London) Well-informed sources here recently stated that negotiations between British and Turkish authorities regarding Turkey's accession to a collective security organization are progressing very smoothly and that an agreement has been reached in principle. It is agreed that if a war breaks out in Europe and spreads to the Balkan Peninsula, Turkey should assist the allied countries of the Balkan Peninsula, namely Romania, Greece, and Yugoslavia, and also assist the Western European countries, namely Britain and France. Conversely, if Turkey is attacked, Britain should immediately provide assistance. In addition, several British and French army and navy experts will travel to Turkey together in the near future to discuss cooperation methods with the Turkish army. Britain and France will also provide Turkey with necessary military supplies in wartime. (Havas, 20th)

### German-Romanian Talks Conclude: Germany Declares No Territorial Ambitions Towards Romania, Understanding Reached on Promoting Economic Cooperation

(Berlin) After Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu was accompanied by the German Foreign Minister to meet with German leader Hitler yesterday, his Berlin talks have concluded. Although no official announcement has been made, people in the German capital seem very satisfied with the general outcome of the talks. It is widely believed that both sides have reached broad agreement and that decisions have been made on commercial cooperation and political relations. According to a statement made by Gafencu to reporters, he has obtained a broad understanding during his visit to Berlin and stated that Romania is willing to cooperate with Germany to the greatest possible extent. (Haitong, 20th)

Rome: According to reliable sources here, German officials have clearly stated to the Romanian Foreign Minister that the country has absolutely no territorial ambitions towards Romania. (Havas, 20th)

(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is scheduled to arrive in Berlin on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, and the next morning he will hold talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax and have lunch together.

On the morning of the 26th, he will visit an air force airfield and the outskirts of London, and then travel to Paris in the afternoon of the same day. (Havas, 20th)

### British Ambassador to Germany to Return to Post Soon; U.S. Attitude Remains Unchanged

(Washington) Political figures here attach great importance to the report announced by British Foreign Secretary Halifax in the House of Commons yesterday that British Ambassador to Germany Henderson will soon return to his post in Berlin. Authoritative sources state that the United States' attitude towards the ambassador's return remains unchanged. In other words, Ambassador Wilson, who was recalled from Germany last month, is still working at the State Department for the time being, and the US embassy in Germany is being handled by a chargé d'affaires. A decision will be made after Hitler's speech on the 28th of this month. (Haitong, 20th)

### British Government Adopts "Carrot and Stick Policy" Towards Totalitarian States; Foreign Secretary Explains Current British Foreign Policy, Aiming for Peace and No Intention of Encircling Germany

(London) Britain continues its efforts to organize a pan-European anti-aggression group, while still leaving avenues open for compromise with totalitarian states. Chamberlain seems to be adopting what the Germans call a "carrot and stick policy." Foreign Secretary Halifax stated in the House of Commons that Britain is willing to engage in economic negotiations with Germany, an act of Britain's expression of peace to Mr. Hitler. However, at the same time, the Prime Minister intends to reorganize the cabinet, which may be said to be the Prime Minister's intention to adopt a tough attitude towards totalitarian states. (Associated Press, 20th)

(London) British Foreign Secretary Halifax spoke in the House of Lords today, explaining various aspects of British policy. He strongly denied the claim that current British political actions have aggressive intentions, saying, "To say that the discussions currently being conducted by the British government and the guarantees it has given against aggression contain any aggressive intentions is simply raving. The cry of 'encirclement' clearly has an effect. I believe it is meant to imply that the British government's aim is to impede the legitimate aspirations of other peoples or to engage in war to prevent their legitimate aspirations from being realized. I am prepared to give the most solemn assurance on behalf of the government that British policy has never had such an intention, because such an intention is not only foolish but also contrary to the entire trend of British thought. The British intention is actually based on the desire for people to live in the world each according to their own wishes. If war does occur in the world, as far as the British people are concerned, the war will be waged only because there is no other way to defend what they consider more important than life itself." The Foreign Secretary spoke of the withdrawal of the world's three major powers from the League of Nations, saying, "Disappointed countries have ultimately rejected the principles aimed at ensuring international security. The danger is even greater when national interests often conflict and ideological clashes occur. We do not always give the same meaning to the same terms. The concept of justice, respect for treaties, and the value of promises are interpreted differently according to national desires, and therefore their demands do not violate rights."

After expressing sympathy and goodwill towards the Spanish government, which is undertaking arduous reconstruction work, the Foreign Secretary said that the main objectives of British foreign policy are the maintenance of genuine world peace and the protection of the assets and legitimate interests of British people overseas. The British government's current efforts to resist any further aggression are not contrary to the policy principles it has stated. On the contrary, the British government hopes that this policy can further confirm its principles and turn aggression into friendly discussions and negotiations. The British government is eager to work with all peace-loving countries and is determined to maintain the independence of neutral countries.

The Foreign Secretary spoke of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in Moscow, saying that he believed that all that could be said at this time was that the two countries were actively engaged in negotiations. He had every hope that the mutual recognition of different viewpoints would enable the negotiations to proceed as desired.

The Foreign Secretary also spoke of President Roosevelt's telegram appealing for peace, saying that the American president had expressed his view of international relations in extremely clear terms and with all his great authority. The British government has clearly expressed its sympathy in this regard. He is convinced that billions of people in all countries expect the American president's initiative to have a successful effect. As for the economic considerations in the current situation suggested by the American president, the British government is prepared to make a contribution in this matter. (Reuters, 19th)

### U.S. Strengthens Defenses in Two Oceans: Adding Naval and Air Bases, Requiring US$66,800,000, Vincent Bill Passed by Senate and Sent to House

(Washington) The Senate today approved a defense bill to build naval aviation bases with US$66,800,000. The bill has now been returned to the House for amendments. (Reuters, 19th)

(Washington) The Vincent Naval Base Bill was unanimously passed in the Senate yesterday. The bill stipulates the establishment of sixteen naval and air force bases, nine of which are in the Pacific, with a cost of $66.8 million. However, the $15 million for the defense of Guam is not included. According to this bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives with 368 votes to 4 six weeks ago, most of the items were built by the Naval Affairs Committee. It is heard that the development of Guam's harbor will be handled together with the river and harbor projects. In addition, the construction costs of the Pacific bases are as follows according to the provisions of this bill:

Wake Island US$2,000,000

Midway Island

US$5,351,000

Johnston Island US$2,884,000

Palmyra Island US$1,20,000

Kodiak Island US$8,741,000

Shelikof Island (Alaska) US$2,884,000

Pearl Harbor US$2,812,000

Unalaska Island US$1,500,000

Kenneya Island US$5,800,000

In addition to the Pacific, the Atlantic side focuses on the Caribbean Sea in the South Atlantic, especially the Panama Canal. The naval and air bases in St. Jean will be expanded with a budget of US$9,138,000. In addition, the fortifications of the nine naval bases in the Pacific are all considered "urgent" constructions in the Navy report. However, once constructed, the line of defense has exceeded 3,000 miles beyond Hawaii. But in general, it is still the triangular line of Alaska, Hawaii and Panama. In addition to this bill, Vincent also proposed a US$30 million naval base public building fee案 for other construction of various bases. (Associated Press, 20th)

### British Cabinet Establishes Ministry of Supply with Burgin as Minister

The research, design, and testing departments in the Army Department will be transferred to the Ministry of Supply. The manufacture and inspection of the Royal Arsenal will be undertaken by the new Minister of Transport. (Reuters, 22nd)

### All of Germany Celebrates the Leader's Birthday: Grand Parade Held in Berlin, 50,000 Army Personnel Paraded, 200 Aircraft Soared Through the Sky

(Berlin) The most important event in Germany's celebration of Hitler's 50th birthday was the military parade held at 11 a.m. this morning. The scale of the parade was unprecedented in Germany. Countless troops were lined up from the former palace square through Linden Street to the newly built East-West Highway. Hitler, accompanied by Air Force Commander-in-Chief Goering, Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder, and Army Commander-in-Chief von Brauchitsch, first inspected the flag team, then drove past the lined-up troops. At 11:20 a.m., they arrived at the judging stand set up at the entrance of the technical school, where many foreign guests were invited to attend. (Haitong, 20th)

(Berlin) The German army, navy, and air force units paraded at 11:00 a.m. this morning to celebrate the birthday of leader Hitler, led by officers, students, and cadets, followed by paratroopers, air transport teams, two regiments of infantry, and one squadron each of cavalry and artillery. Next were various motorized units, including a unit of infantry transported by trucks, three units of tank vehicles transported by trucks, and then flat-fire artillery teams, anti-aircraft artillery teams, motorized cavalry teams, and motorized artillery teams. The entire procession took 45 minutes to pass in front of the leader. (Havas, 20th)

(Berlin) Today is leader Hitler's 50th birthday. Celebrations here began at 9:00 a.m. First, the leader's guards paraded in front of the Prime Minister's office. Until 9:25 a.m., Archbishop Orsenigo, the Papal Ambassador and leader of the diplomatic corps, extended birthday greetings to leader Hitler on behalf of the diplomatic corps. After that, ambassadors, ministers, and dignitaries from various countries, such as Privy Council President and Protector of Bohemia and Moravia Neurath, Bohemian and Moravian President Hácha, Slovak Prime Minister Tiso, and Berlin Mayor Lippert, all congratulated the leader. The Nazi leader of the Free City of Danzig, Forster, also presented the leader with a certificate of honorary citizen of the Free City. Until 11:00 a.m., leader Hitler, accompanied by Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Army General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Army General von Brauchitsch, and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Raeder, held a large-scale army parade with as many as 50,000 troops participating, and 200 aircraft soared through the sky, making it a grand occasion. (Havas, 20th)

(Berlin) Eight million five hundred thousand Germans are celebrating leader Hitler's 50th birthday today. All industries are closed for a day, so that all people can participate in the National Socialist Party's rallies on streets decorated with national flags. Mr. Hitler met with all his subordinates in the leader's house this morning, from secretariat staff to tailors and barbers. This kind of reception is completely the same as the leader's previous preferential treatment of the general public, because in the past year, Hitler has traveled all over the country, and his opportunities to approach the public are also more than in the past. (Associated Press, 20th)

### The Leader's Close Associates Offer Praises and Eulogies

(Berlin) As Germany celebrates the 50th birthday of its leader Hitler, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels delivered a special broadcast speech last night, broadcast throughout the country, revealing the great significance of celebrating the leader's birthday. He said, "All countries that have moved from friendship to alliance with Germany will naturally feel honored with the German people on this occasion of the leader's birthday. Even countries that are usually distant from Germany will have a deep impression. Today, the name of Hitler has become a program of world politics, and it has amazed the world like a legend and myth. World culture has been divided into two major camps because of this. Anyone who examines today's world must study the word Hitler in order to understand what the world is. In the past ten years, Hitler has set off a huge wave of spiritual revolution, transforming Germany into a new look. Germany in 1918 is very different from today. The spiritual revolution unprecedented in history has created today's Great Germany, the most commendable of which is that it was completed without shedding a drop of blood. What is especially important is that the man-made situation in Europe, although peaceful on the surface, is actually fraught with crises, and there is a danger of a prairie fire at any time. Now Hitler has laid the foundation for its peace with a spiritual revolution. This peace is built on a realistic foundation, not on abstract rational morality. Hitler's policies have always been far-sighted, and both ideals and reality are emphasized. Ideals are the mother of facts, and reality is the fruit of facts. This is Hitler's political genius, who is very capable of holding a simple and unwavering purpose, and using unpredictable methods to create today's Great Germany. Although Western democratic countries inevitably envy the National Socialist Germany, they have always wanted to imprison Germany with the Treaty of Versailles, but with Hitler's 20 years of struggle, they have already broken free from this shackle and rebuilt Germany on a solid military strength. Economic life and cultural life are now thriving. The once-fallen country has now regained its light." (Haitong, 20th)

(Berlin) Tomorrow is leader Hitler's 50th birthday. Minister of Aviation Goering gave a eulogy this afternoon, saying, "The leader is the greatest figure since ancient times. Politicians and statesmen all over the world often engage in conspiracies and tactics. Foreign journalists often slander our country. We should all ignore them. What we should listen to is only the leader's instructions." In addition, leader party representative and Minister without Portfolio Hess, on behalf of the National Socialist Party, presented 50 letters handwritten by former Prussian King Frederick I to the leader as a birthday gift. (Havas, 19th)

General Goering also published a special article in the National Socialist Party's organ newspaper "People's Observer" to praise him, saying, "Germany's ability to move from the valley to the tree and re-establish itself in an outstanding position is due to leader Hitler's hard work over the years. Today, Germany's military strength is fearless in terms of land, sea, and air, protecting the safety of Germany's vast territory. In today's world, no one can surpass Germany's leader Hitler in this amazing and great cause. Hitler is the greatest politician in German history. On the occasion of the leader's 50th birthday, we really have no appropriate words to express the gratitude and admiration in our hearts." (Haitong, 20th)

### Foreign Envoys Promoted and Decorated

(Berlin) On the occasion of German leader Hitler's 50th birthday today, the German government issued an order appointing former Shanghai Consul General Lieutenant Colonel Kriebel as Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promoting Shanghai Deputy Consul Luedtke to Consul, and promoting Consul Schäfer in Chongqing to First-Class Consul. In addition, Duernburg, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Klinger, former Consul General in San Francisco, were all given the title of Minister Plenipotentiary. (Haitong, 20th)

### Representatives from Twenty-Three Countries Congratulate Hitler; Congratulatory Telegrams Arrive Like Snowflakes

(Berlin) At least guests from 23 countries are participating in today’s celebration of the 50th birthday of German Leader Hitler. Britain and France did not send official delegations, only two Britons, Major General Fuller and Sir Robert Brocklehurst, both guests of Hitler in a private capacity. (Reuters, 20th)

(Berlin) Today is the 50th birthday of German leader Hitler, and there are more than 10,000 telegrams and congratulatory letters from various places. The room is full of various gifts. (Associated Press, 20th)

(Tokyo) The Japanese Emperor has telegraphed Hitler to congratulate him on his 50th birthday. (Reuters, 20th)

### The Soviet Union's Military Equipment is Substantial, Fully Defending the Country; Army Chief Inspects Western Border Defenses and Returns to Beijing; Major Cities Hold Air Defense Exercises

(London) According to news from Moscow, the Soviet Army recently conducted exercises in the area near the Baltic coast along the borders of various countries. National Defense People's Commissar Marshal Voroshilov also went to the western border to inspect the defenses, which lasted for three weeks, and only recently returned to Moscow. In addition, Deputy National Defense People's Commissar Mekhlis once said, "The Soviet Union's strength is sufficient to cope with all contingencies. Once a crisis occurs, there is no need to mobilize temporarily, nor is there a need to seek allied countries." Foreign observers are therefore increasingly convinced that the country is indeed prepared. Generally, Moscow believes that Germany may take advantage of the birthday opportunity of the country's leader Hitler to take action against the Free City of Danzig, which is still uncertain, and the Soviet Union also suspects whether Poland is willing to share weal and woe with Romania when Germany engages in aggression. Moreover, news from Warsaw repeatedly stated that Poland is willing to negotiate directly with Germany on the issue of Danzig Freedom City, which has caused a bad impression on the Soviet Union. In the Soviet press, they all spoke of a collective security system and a collective anti-aggression movement. When commenting on the telegram sent by US President Roosevelt, they all said that German and Italian dictators may submit a deceitful reply of peace "in order to deceive the Western governments and make them give up the proposed peace guarantee measures." (Havas, 19th)

(Moscow) Large-scale public air defense and anti-gas exercises are being conducted in 60 cities throughout the Soviet Union, including Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Khabarovsk, Baku, Minsk, etc. After the alarm is issued, all working people in the city wear gas masks and continue to work. The exercise is scheduled to be held until May 1. (TASS, 19th)

### German Fleet Sails to Western Waters, Detouring Through the British North Sea; Submarine Squadron Crosses the English Channel

(London) Well-informed sources here recently stated that the German fleet departed from Kiel, Germany on the 18th of this month and traveled to the Spanish waters via the northern waterway of England. It does not appear that all ships sailed together. Two squadrons of submarines likely crossed the English Channel at night, while other ships detoured through the northern part of England. (Havas, 20th)

Lisbon: The German naval fleet, including two battleships, two cruisers, two squadrons of destroyers, and three squadrons of submarines, departed from Kiel, Germany yesterday and will arrive in this port on the 6th of next month and drop anchor until the 10th of next month. (Havas, 20th

### The Transforming Power of Love

Many men and women, after getting married, completely change their thoughts, actions, personalities, and habits. Therefore, we know that love truly has a marvelous transforming effect. This is a fact. A proud young woman, when at her parents' home, would not even deign to bow her head to her parents; everything was her world. However, once she marries a loving husband, not only does it cause a significant change in her physiology, but her personality also becomes infinitely considerate and gentle as she serves her beloved husband. Sometimes, when they have a child who is the crystallization of their love, even if she was very fastidious and clean before marriage, she doesn't feel that her child's feces and urine are dirty at all. She sometimes even has a feeling of admiration, thinking that her beloved husband is truly an all-powerful transforming doctor.

Men are the same. Many who are wasteful before marriage become very frugal after marriage. Some even regard their beloved wife as their soul, with all their words and deeds governed by this soul, completely different from before. Some who were physically weak become healthy after marriage. Indeed, an adult's life is truly inseparable from love. As a Western saying goes, "A fulfilling life must be led by wisdom and encouraged by love." If a person loses love, how dull and miserable will their life feel? Therefore, whether male or female, as long as it is for love, they are willing to be transformed by him or her. Indeed, once an energetic man marries a beautiful and graceful woman, because of the intensity of their love, some differences will occur in their thoughts, actions, personalities, and habits, but these differences will inevitably be subtly influenced and gradually become consistent. Therefore, in the harmony of love, they not only transform themselves but also create their future life. How beautiful and happy this is!

However, transformation must be based on a healthy body. If a man has committed masturbation or nocturnal emission in his early years, or because of post-marital debauchery and overindulgence, as well as worries and injuries, he suffers from spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm and infertility, neurasthenia, and other symptoms, then the sexual life that forms the foundation of the couple will inevitably be imperfect. Love will be destroyed because of this. Without love, there is naturally no talk of transformation and creation. I am afraid that their entire world will be destroyed with it. Aren't there truly many who divorce or commit suicide because of a lack of love?

A clever husband who wants to seek a remedy must fundamentally treat his illness. According to world-renowned doctors and my own experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" [likely translated as Reproductive Essence] is the most effective treatment for these symptoms. Because this preparation can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, invigorate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves in one day and night after taking it. Continuous use will surely fundamentally cure the above symptoms in a short period. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Ximituo Shi Gu Jing Pian" [likely translated as Ximituo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets] to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, then the effect will be even faster. If you can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by a specialist doctor and then use various scientific therapies, a cure can be guaranteed.

Health and Beauty

### The Relationship Between Breasts and Pregnancy

— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine

In today's national spiritual mobilization, we can no longer leave health to be able to reproduce and survive. Health is not only a problem that every man cannot ignore, but also something that every woman should strive to achieve. Women in Europe and America have an unusually rich understanding of health and beauty. They recognize that the development of the breasts is to create a healthy soul, and plump hips are to form a beautiful body. They are constantly using various scientific methods to achieve health and beauty standards.

There is an iron-like fact before our eyes. Just look at women with withered breasts, who are bound to lose health and happiness, and suffer from many illnesses and pains. Not only will they inevitably fail in future competitions for health and beauty, but once they enter into sexual life, they will inevitably promote conditions such as anesthesia and infertility. Even if they conceive, the children born will not only be difficult to raise, but also because of the mother's scant or overly weak milk, their mortality will be particularly high. As a result, they cannot fit into society and serve and perform their duties like men, nor can they win the favor of their husbands, giving birth to whimsically, or even being abandoned by their husbands. There is no happiness at all!

But why do women's breasts wither? According to the experience of world-renowned gynecologist Randeaning and others, it is believed that it is caused by masturbation, chest binding, leucorrhea, irregular menstruation, and postpartum weakness, which destroys the function of the ovaries. The only remedy is to actively take the ovarian preparation for women, "Sheng Zhi Su" [likely translated as Reproductive Essence], which is the most effective treatment. This preparation is well-formulated, and after taking it for one day and night, it can nourish the function of the ovaries, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leucorrhea. If you continue to take it, it can not only make withered breasts become high, but also make thin hips become plump, strengthen the body and beautify the face. The benefits are too numerous to mention.

### The Sorrow of Youth with Nocturnal Emission and Masturbation

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

The problem of youth masturbation is really too serious, because this is the starting point of going down a dead end. Once a young person masturbates in the early stages of spring, it is extremely easy to become addicted. If the bad habit is slightly deeper, the sperm gate will inevitably be destroyed and become loose, and the sexual nerves will also be easily weakened due to excessive stimulation. At this stage, spermatorrhea is bound to follow. Semen is of great importance to our health and longevity. Now, with spermatorrhea, the semen in the body is equivalent to having a leaky vessel, then the body's health will inevitably decline rapidly. Therefore, gradually the face becomes sallow and thin, appetite is poor, brainpower is weak, memory is poor, back aches, limbs are tired, spirit is depressed, and ambition is depressed. If this kind of youth is studying at school, they will be mentally disturbed, failure is imminent, and their studies will inevitably be lower than their peers, or even fail and be expelled. If they want to learn a trade, how can they endure hardship, be diligent in their duties? Not only will their skills not be outstanding, but there will be a place to lose their job! If they are in love, because of their unsightly appearance, they will inevitably be rejected by the opposite sex, fall into the pain of unrequited love. Even worse, if spermatorrhea is too frequent, the development function is prevented, resulting in short stature, and the sex organ is as short and small as a finger, kidney deficiency and impotence, thin sperm and infertility and other symptoms will follow one after another. In this way, in married life, they will inevitably be hated by their wives, tragedies will be staged in the family, or there will be no children, leaving a lifelong regret!

The only treatment for spermatorrhea at this time is to continuously take "Ximituo Shi Gu Jing Pian" [likely translated as Ximituo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets] to strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves, then the spermatorrhea can be cured. Those who have caused the above symptoms due to spermatorrhea must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" [likely translated as Reproductive Essence] to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase semen and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continuous use will surely achieve the effect of curing diseases and prolonging life. If the patient can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by a specialist doctor and then use electrotherapy, injection, surgery and other symptomatic treatments, a cure can be guaranteed.

### Acute Gonorrhea That Is Easily Cured

Acute white turbidity is unbearable for patients because of the pain, and they are encountering it for the first time, so they don't know what to do. In fact, this kind of acute gonorrhea is not as dangerous as the patient feels when they are in pain. Not only is it not a dangerous symptom, but it is also a symptom that is easy to treat. The patient's consciousness should be calm, and they should quickly ask a doctor with experience, complete equipment, and willingness to take responsibility for treatment, so that they can be fundamentally cured in seven or eight days. The most difficult problem with acute white turbidity is whether the doctor can be responsible for thoroughly treating the patient, and whether the patient can recuperate and abandon bad medicines. If you are cautious in choosing a doctor and recuperating, it is the easiest way for the patient to get rid of the pain of gonorrhea. Patients must pay attention! .

Patients develop symptoms three or four days after unclean sexual intercourse. The body develops a temperature of 37 or 38 degrees, the head is swollen, the foreskin is swollen, there is pus and blood, and urination is unusually difficult. For the treatment of acute white turbidity, I first use a specially made vaccine and the most advanced chemical therapy. At the same time, I also use German Luzhuping electrotherapy and cooling methods to produce an antitoxic effect in the body, quickly extinguish the gonorrhea bacteria like a raging fire, and stop the inflammation. Therefore, the pain can be stopped on the same day, the turbidity can be cleared and inflammation can be eliminated in three days, and a complete cure can be achieved in one week. It has been proven time and time again. Experts in Europe and the West have recently become quite interested in this therapy, and more and more people are adopting it. All famous venereal disease hospitals have unanimously adopted it. The reason is that it has excellent results, and the cure rate for acute gonorrhea accounts for more than 90%.

### The Suspected Kidnapping Case of Mr. Taiaote: Japanese Authorities Ordered All Parties Involved to Keep Secrets; Seemed Remorseful After His Release; Chen Xigeng Assassinated and Killed; Tianjin Falls into Unease Again

The Tianjin correspondent of the Zi Lin Xi Bao (North China Daily News) on April 12 reported: Mr. Taiaote, who was kidnapped, was released on April 3 after being held for 17 days. The exact details of Taiaote's kidnapping, especially his release, are shrouded in mystery. It is said that at the request of the Japanese military authorities, all parties involved in this matter must keep it secret, so they have remained silent to this day. It is not allowed to disclose any information about this strange incident. The only thing that seems certain is that no ransom was paid. The Japanese seemed remorseful after the incident and assured the foreign consuls that foreign residents could now return to their residences in the special zone with peace of mind, as they would guarantee the complete safety of foreigners. All of this is very incomprehensible and has naturally aroused discussion and ridicule among the general public. This case cannot be considered resolved, and the troubling problem of controlling terrorism in the foreign concessions seems to have arisen again. The shooting in the cinema in this port has plunged Tianjin into unease again. At 5:30 pm on April 9, Chen Xigeng, the customs superintendent, was shot and killed in the Da Guangming Cinema. When the murderer fled, two foreigners were killed, one being killed and one seriously injured. The assassination appeared to have been carefully planned, and the choice of time, place, and method of tracking the victim had been premeditated for a long time. Before the incident, a Chinese man wearing Western clothes and speaking with a northern accent went to the ticket office of the Da Guangming Cinema and asked the theater to add a few words to the screen, notifying Mr. Chen to come out to the rest area, saying that a friend was waiting for him to talk to him. At that time, Mr. Chen was sitting in the balcony with his wife and children watching the film "Gong Geting" [likely "Going Gay"]. Upon seeing the message, he got up to leave, but his wife said it would not be too late to leave after the film was over. The man waiting outside tried to lure Mr. Chen to the rest area using this method, so that he could escape more easily. Seeing that this plan did not work, he bought a balcony ticket and went inside, choosing to sit behind Mr. Chen. When the film was about to end, a scene showing British troops fighting rioters was being screened, and gunshots were continuous. The man sitting behind Mr. Chen, whether he deliberately chose this opportunity or happened to encounter it, was an opportunity suitable for the act. He immediately took out a large .38 caliber Mauser pistol from his pocket and fired four shots directly at Mr. Chen in front of him. One bullet hit Mr. Chen's wrist, one bullet went through both cheeks, and hit a certain Chinese youth in the front row. The third bullet hit the head. Mr. Chen got up and staggered a few steps before falling to the ground and dying. At first, due to the darkness in the theater and the noise of the film, the audience did not know that a tragedy had occurred, but the young Russian sportsman Mansurov, who was sitting at the end of that row, had seen it. When the murderer fled past him, Mansurov tried to grab him, but was shot in the abdomen. When the murderer rushed downstairs, he encountered Klose, a Swiss engineer from the tram company. It is not known whether he also tried to stop the murderer, or whether the murderer fired a shot to facilitate his escape. Klose was shot and died on the spot. An empty pistol abandoned by the murderer was found next to his body. Before the shouts broke out in the theater, the murderer had already fled into the bustling city. Mansurov was rushed to a nearby hospital and underwent emergency surgery. He is expected to recover. Klose left behind a wife and a child. He was about to retire and return to his country, but unexpectedly died in the disaster. The assassination of Mr. Chen was clearly political in nature. Last year, Mr. Chen served as the "President of the Tianjin Branch of the United Reserve Bank." On March 24, he was appointed by the "Provisional Government" as the Tianjin Customs Superintendent, but in fact he did not take this position. He neither entered the Customs nor met with Customs personnel. A week ago, Chen went to Beiping for a trip. According to him, he intends to ask the "Provisional Government" to cancel the appointment, because Chen has received many warnings and dare not accept this position and take the terrible risk.

### Japanese Troops in Rugao Forcibly Conscript Recruits

Chinese Troops Fiercely Attack Xinsheng Port

One Japanese Soldier Killed in Heavy Fighting

A Rugao dispatch reports that Rugao has been occupied for more than a year since its fall on March 18 last year. The area occupied by the Japanese troops is only in the urban area and the area along the Tongru-Ruxin highway. The suburbs are still under the control of Chinese troops. Recently, because the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties on the front line, they first investigated the household registration in their occupied areas, and then forcibly conscripted recruits, one person per bao (unit of 10 households). If a recruit escapes and does not return, their property will be destroyed or confiscated. For example, Zhang Chengren, the former President of the Beiping Court and former magistrate of Dongtai County, who lived in Shanghai to avoid the violence of the Japanese troops, had not returned home for a long time. His residence in Shizhuang Town was demolished by the Japanese troops, resulting in immeasurable losses. There are countless similar cases. It is reported that the first batch of conscripted recruits have been concentrated for training and will soon be transferred to other places. However, the families of the conscripted recruits are all anxious and crying in pain. It is said to be tragic. Xinsheng Port is located in the southwestern countryside of Rugao and can be reached directly by the Ruxin Highway. It is an important transportation hub for the county. After the Japanese troops occupied Rugao, they occupied the port, stationed heavy troops, and strictly inspected travelers. In this year, Chinese troops attacked the port more than ninety times, causing great panic among the Japanese troops. Therefore, two months ago, they forced the waterfront workers to build strong barracks, which were only recently completed. At about 2 pm on the 12th of this month, about 70 or 80 Chinese troops came to the port disguised as villagers to destroy the buildings. When the Chinese troops arrived at the port, they were discovered by the Japanese troops, and they fired at each other. The sound of light and heavy machine guns and grenades was endless. Residents fled to the surrounding countryside, especially the members of the puppet organizations, who fled in panic and were in a state of utter chaos. The Chinese troops surrounded the barracks and bombed them for three hours. During the heavy fighting, one Japanese soldier was killed and several were injured. Later, because the Japanese troops from Shizhuang Town, three miles away from the port, came to the rescue, the Chinese troops withdrew due to the disparity in numbers.

### The North Jiangsu Army Has Completed the Counter-Offensive Deployment; The Entire War Zone Has Adopted a Counter-Offensive Posture; Huaiyin and Huaian Have Been Surrounded by Chinese Troops; The Chinese Troops in Siyang Seized Many Spoils of War

A Taixian dispatch reports that the various units of the Chinese army in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu have completed their deployment and are now launching the prelude to guerrilla warfare. The heroic soldiers of the Chinese army feel very excited as they are active in the plains and mountains during this bright spring season. At the moment, the entire war zone has adopted a counter-offensive posture. In northern Jiangsu, Huaiyin and Huaian have been surrounded separately. They have been fiercely attacking the southwest gates for days. The Japanese troops in the city are holding on to the walls, and the fierce fighting has lasted for two days and nights. The county towns of Lianshui, Funing, Siyang, and Suqian are all under the surveillance and siege of the Chinese army. The Japanese troops cannot take care of each other, and their occupied cities and strongholds are showing signs of wavering.

Funing Residents Annihilate Japanese Troops

The Japanese troops stationed in Funing forced the people to use counterfeit money and stipulated that one yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for six jiao of counterfeit money. The people hated them to the bone. For days, they have repeatedly attacked the Japanese troops in the suburbs. More than 70 Japanese troops stationed in Xiaowuzi Town in the county were again raided by the Republic of China on the 5th. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and were almost completely annihilated. After hearing the news, the Japanese headquarters urgently sent troops to rescue them, but the militia unit had safely returned to their defense. In addition, there are currently a total of 600 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops in Funing City. On the 4th, more than 100 infantrymen were sent to Yangzhai, allegedly to capture anti-Japanese elements and slaughtered 30 to 40 civilians. The local people, who have been repeatedly slaughtered by the Japanese troops for days, have automatically formed armed groups for self-defense and are preparing to give the Japanese troops a serious blow.

The People of Lianshui Rise Up to Resist the Enemy

Recently, the people of Lianshui have repeatedly intercepted the Japanese troops. The situation is as follows: (1) On the 2nd, more than 100 Japanese infantrymen, with two artillery pieces, retreated from Lianshui to Funing. About 1,000 militia from the sixth and seventh districts of Lianshui pursued the Japanese troops in separate directions. They encountered the militia when passing through Dachengguo Village, and the fierce fighting lasted for about two hours. (2) One tank and 50 or 60 infantrymen retreated from Lianshui to Xin'an Town on the 4th. They came into contact with the militia when passing through Shijia Wharf, and the fighting lasted for about four or five hours before they fled. (3) There are a small number of Japanese in Chenjiagang, Xiangshui ★, Xin'an Town, Zhangjiadian, Dayi Mountain, Xinpu, Banpu, and Yangjiaji in Lianshui. (4) There are about six or seven small Japanese ships parked in Xichao Lake in Xiangshui, which travel back and forth between Xiangshui and Chenjiagang from time to time. (5) There are still 400 to 500 Japanese troops in Xiangshui. Han Jianru, a traitor, is the chairman of the town's maintenance association. Han was originally employed by Gangqing Shipping Company in Chenjiagang.

Siyang County Magistrate Wins Bloody Battle

Wang Dianhua, the magistrate of Siyang County, led the county's regular troops to fight fiercely with the Japanese troops in Zhuangtan, Shijiazhuang, and Lujiazui on March 22, and sank three Japanese sailing ships and destroyed several others at Yunjia Ferry that evening, killing more than 30 Japanese soldiers, including the squad leader Suzuki. They captured a gas cannon, two boxes of ammunition, one light machine gun, 1,000 rounds of ammunition, more than a dozen sets of khaki military uniforms, eight gas masks, several boxes of medicines, and operational plans and diaries. Bian Youcai, the leader of the Chinese detachment, had his left ear pierced by an explosion, the soldier Pan Decai was killed by an explosion, and Wang Youhai was wounded by an explosion. A total of more than 20 Japanese corpses were recovered. In addition, the Siyang County Government Office is currently temporarily set up. Magistrate Wang is currently organizing a traitor eradication team and has killed more than a dozen traitors. After receiving the report, Chairman Han not only credited Magistrate Wang with one merit but also awarded bonuses to reward the troops. He also ordered Magistrate Wang to submit a report on the meritorious officers and soldiers separately for commendation.

### The Result of the Wu County Puppet Government's Collection of Land Tax

Most Landowners Refuse to Pay

The Puppet Government Is in Dire Straits and Cannot Maintain Itself

A Suzhou dispatch reports that the puppet county government is in dire financial straits due to the weak collection of land tax and will be unable to maintain itself. The county has more than 1.8 million mu of land in Changyuan, Yuanhe, and the Taihu Lake area. If all the provincial and county taxes are collected, it would amount to about 1.8 million. Among them, more than 1 million mu of land is managed by various businesses, which pay the grain tax. For more than 700,000 mu of self-owned land, the grain tax is paid directly by the farmers. The first installment of grain tax to be collected for self-owned land in the 27th year totaled 633,802 households. As of the end of March, only more than 10,000 households had paid, and more than 620,000 were estimated to be unpaid. The situation is the same for the second installment. Only more than 8,000 households have paid so far. Therefore, the puppet taxation office has only collected about 10,000 yuan. The financial exhaustion of the puppet county government can be seen from this.

### The Downfall of Traitors in Wukang County

Yao Laoqiao, Chairman of the Maintenance Association

Was Dismembered by Japanese Troops After Being Suspended in the Air

A Ningbo dispatch reports that Yao Laoqiao, the chairman of the puppet maintenance association in Wukang County, was taken to Hangzhou by Japanese troops and sentenced to death for leaking military secrets. Yao's hands and feet were nailed to a board and suspended in the air until he was torn apart. The manner of death was extremely tragic.

### The New Fourth Army's Training Camp Transformed into an Anti-Japanese Academy; Enrollment to Begin in Mid-May

(Tunxi dispatch) In order to implement the training of guerrilla cadres, the New Fourth Army previously established a large-scale training camp in the Southern Anhui Headquarters, specializing in recruiting unemployed youths from guerrilla areas and teaching them special military and political knowledge. More than 1,000 youths from various places who heard the news went to enroll and receive training for a term of three months. After graduation, they were assigned to various guerrilla areas to organize and train the people. The educational methods adopted the following four types: (1) Military education, such as battlefield orders, guerrilla tactics, field service, shooting regulations, and military geography; (2) Classroom education, such as the anti-Japanese situation, training the people, international issues, and the history of the Chinese revolution; (3) Incidental education, which is to implement education whenever there is an opportunity, such as various commemorative days, temporary problems among students, or meaningful domestic and foreign news are used as teaching materials, and opportunities are used to implement extracurricular education; (4) Self-education, which is the education of students by students, such as discussion meetings, life review meetings, and seminars. It is now reported that the first class of trained youths is about to graduate, and the second class will be expanded and transformed into an Anti-Japanese Academy. Its internal organization will follow the methods of the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" and "Shaanxi Public School" in the Northwest. It is expected that enrollment can begin in mid-May.

### The Third National Education Conference Resolutions (12) Proposal for Improving Physical Education (Part 1)

(Special Correspondent Yi Sheng's Airmail from Chongqing)

The following is the physical education improvement proposal passed by the National Education Conference:

Regarding how physical education should be implemented in the future to align with the overall educational policy and realize its due function, careful planning and formulation of a plan are necessary, to be implemented in stages to achieve the ultimate goal. Here, seventeen principles are proposed as guidelines for formulating plans and measures: (1) The purpose of physical education is to cultivate the ability to defend the nation. The scope of physical education ranges from personal health to the survival of the nation, the race, and even humanity. The content of physical education includes all large muscle physical activities and hygienic living. The method of physical education is to use physical activity as a tool to achieve educational effects. These principles should be fully elucidated in an effective manner to dispel past misunderstandings and establish future beliefs. (2) Physical education administration should establish a sound and effective organizational system, strengthen the physical education administrative agencies of the Ministry of Education, and determine their legal status so they can be responsible for the design and implementation of national physical education and health education. Education departments (social bureaus) of each province (city) should add physical education sections to promote central physical education and health education laws and guide the facilities for local physical education and health education. Education bureaus (sections) of each county (city) should add physical education administrative personnel to implement local physical education and health education so that all physical education and health laws can be promoted at each level and physical education and health undertakings can be universally developed. (3) Physical education and health education funding should be formally included in the regular budget of the central and local governments as a part of the cultural undertaking expenditure, to facilitate the enrichment of equipment, the cultivation of personnel, and the organization of undertakings. The amount should be based on the needs of the implementation plan and establish standards. (4) Local and school physical education venues, supplies, and health facilities should be planned and managed in a unified manner by the competent authorities at all levels, taking into account the needs of all parties, establishing standards, and expanding in stages. Parks and public lands should be utilized as much as possible to create a good environment. Rewards should be given for self-made equipment and supplies to maintain economic benefits. (5) Elementary school physical education should focus on promoting physical development, cultivating hygienic habits, and promoting a lively and natural spirit, striving for physical and mental health, to establish the foundation for healthy citizens. Physical education teaching time should be appropriately increased, and time between and after classes should be fully utilized. Physical education materials should be introduced and supplied more. Natural environments should have more contact opportunities to meet the needs of childhood. Children's hygienic life should be earnestly guided and instructed. Physical defects in children should be corrected and treated. Children's development should be notified to parents regularly to obtain cooperation. Children's physical education achievements should be established with appropriate standards and strictly assessed. (6) Middle school physical education, in addition to continuing the aim of elementary school physical education, should focus on developing basic physical fitness and cultivating applied skills, completing the work of strengthening the body and defending oneself, and starting training to defend the country. Students in vocational schools and normal schools have the same need for physical education training as students in ordinary middle schools. Therefore, their physical education goals and methods should not have any differences. The time specified in the original curriculum standards should be appropriately increased so that physical education activities can be taught as much as possible. The administration of physical education and health education in the entire school should establish a central organization for overall planning. Extracurricular exercise is an essential part of physical education training and should be strictly organized and effectively managed. Physical examination is the scientific basis for physical education facilities and should be held on time, paying attention to follow-up. Physical education grades should be made into reasonable standards so that students can self-examine their progress and improve training effectiveness. Physical education teachers should be carefully selected, physical education funding should be fully allocated, and physical education and health equipment should meet the minimum standards. (7) Physical education in colleges and universities should build on the foundation cultivated in primary and secondary schools, promote it, and pay special attention to maintaining and enhancing health and interest in sports so that when transitioning from school life to social life, these good living habits can be transferred and followed throughout life. Therefore, the training method should be light on passive teaching and heavy on active participation, abandoning general basic training and adopting a system of free elective study. All design and guidance are the responsibility of experts. The management and supervision of physical education and health should have an independent administrative organization to facilitate implementation, and students should be instructed to automatically handle extracurricular sports and group life, thereby cultivating their ability to handle affairs and respond, and increasing their service efficiency. (8) Daily life, such as diet and daily life, of students at all levels of schools should be detailed and strictly implemented to protect the health of young children. (9) Private schools and civil schools should add physical education and hygiene training.

### This City's Spiritual Mobilization Association Was Commended by the Head Office in a Telegram Today Is Culture Circle's Propaganda Day Publishing a Declaration to Complete the Mission of One's Position

The National Spiritual Mobilization Association of All Circles in This City, after its formal establishment on March 22 this year, immediately telegraphed President Jiang of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association to report the establishment process and the work situation. Recently, the Association received a reply telegram from Secretary-General Zhang Yuejun of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association, which was very comforting. Now, it is recorded as follows: To the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of All Circles in Shanghai City, I have read your good telegram. National spiritual mobilization is indeed an important strategy for resisting the war and building the nation. Shanghai has been mired for a long time, and the temptation and threat of the cunning invaders are even worse. Arouse the spirit of patriotism, cheer for the War of Resistance, is especially necessary. Your Association leads the masses, organizes the Association, and uses the inherent occupational groups of all circles to widely establish lasting institutions to promote the work separately, with profound planning, which is worthy of praise. Your preparatory filing is approved. It is hoped that you will continue your efforts and persevere. This is our great hope. Zhang Qun respectfully bowed,

### Cultural Declaration

Today is Cultural Circle's Propaganda Day, and all newspapers and magazines in the city have unanimously mobilized to prepare to complete the mission of their positions. Now, a declaration is recorded as follows: Today is the National Spiritual Mobilization Cultural Circle's Propaganda Day. We, cultural comrades, are members of the nation and should actively participate in the Spiritual Mobilization Movement and solemnly swear to abide by the National Covenant to fully practice the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline promulgated by the Central Government. Culture is originally the spiritual industry of the country and the nation, and the cause done by the cultural circle is also the spiritual cause of the country and the nation. Therefore, the responsibility of us, cultural comrades, to promote National Spiritual Mobilization is particularly important. Now, based on the views of comrades, we will speak separately. The three major elements of war are manpower, financial resources, and military power. This is generally recognized. Manpower is the integrating and leading force of these three major elements, and spirit is the original driving force of all manpower. Specifically, spirit is the comprehensive, integrative, creative, and initiating force of human behavior. The so-called spiritual mobilization is to concentrate our comprehensive, integrative, creative, and initiating forces, striving towards the three common goals of national supremacy, ethnic supremacy, military first, victory first, and concentration of will, concentration of strength, to complete the sacred task of resisting the war and building the nation. First of all, we must understand the necessity of resisting the war and building the nation. We cannot deny that for the past two hundred years, our nation has indeed been declining. In the past, we have repeatedly suffered from foreign aggression, ceding land and paying reparations, and losing sovereignty, and we are almost no longer a country. However, we still live in peace and do not strive for prosperity, so that the enemy takes advantage of the situation and invades our territory. Since the Eastern sleeping lion roared at Lugou Bridge, after more than twenty-one months of War of Resistance experience, we deeply know that only resisting the war can maintain the independence, freedom, and peace of the Chinese nation. Only building the nation can consolidate and build the foundation of the difficult Republic of China. At the same time, international events have also fully proved that not resisting aggression will inevitably lead to the tragedy of national subjugation, and that compromise with the aggressor is tantamount to seeking skin with a tiger, which will inevitably harm oneself. From this point of view, we should continue to resist the war and build the nation, which is beyond doubt. Our problem is how to concentrate the nation's manpower, financial resources, and material resources, with the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, and strive to struggle to achieve the final victory. The task of resisting the war and building the nation is originally the duty of every citizen. We cultural comrades have always been admired by our compatriots as outstanding members of the nation, and the responsibility for resisting the war and building the nation is naturally even greater. When the National Spiritual Mobilization is launched, we should vow to abide by the National Covenant and should check our own lives, so that all behaviors can comply with the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and its implementation measures. We are all workers in the cultural cause, that is, promoters of the spiritual cause. Our brain is the agency that issues orders for our behavior, our mouth and pen are our sharp weapons, and our limbs are our tools for riding horses to kill the enemy and getting off horses to write proclamations. From now on, we respectfully dedicate our entire lives to the country and the nation. As for the implementation measures, we have other regulations, so I will not elaborate on them. Hereby this declaration.

### Amicable Negotiations Resolve Misunderstandings: Flag Dispute Resolved, French Concession Shops Reopen, Arrested Individuals Released Sequentially, National Flag Retrieved by Ratepayers' Association

Following the French Concession authorities' interference with the flag-hanging incident, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession persuaded shops to reopen first. Shops complied with this advice and resumed business from the afternoon of yesterday. The Ratepayers' Association also negotiated with the French Municipal Police Headquarters, and the arrested citizens were released sequentially yesterday. The national flag was retrieved by the Ratepayers' Association with a letter. Details are as follows:

Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Others Urge Reopening

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession issued urgent notices separately yesterday morning to urge the reopening of shops in the French Concession. The notices are as follows:

Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notice: China and France have always maintained cordial relations. This flag-hanging dispute was caused by the excessive actions of the Annamese police in the performance of their duties. All sectors regret this. In addition to telegraphing the government to negotiate, we urge all shops to reopen immediately and await a legal and reasonable resolution with a steadfast and resolute attitude. This is our sincere hope.

Ratepayers' Association Notice: Regarding the flag-hanging incident, this association has already dispatched representatives to discuss solutions with the French authorities. For the sake of Sino-French relations, we urge all shops to share the difficulties and resume business as usual to prevent the situation from escalating and to facilitate progress. This is our sincere hope. This notice.

Ratepayers' Association Negotiations Yesterday

The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession sent representatives Qu Zhenhua, Dai Chunfeng, and Gong Jingyan to negotiate the interference with the flag-hanging incident. They first met with the Police Commissioner of the French Municipal Police Headquarters at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Deputy Commissioner Rauberger received them. In addition to stating the opinions of the merchants and residents, the three representatives requested: (1) the immediate release of all arrested individuals; (2) the return of all confiscated national flags to the shops by the police; and (3) the freedom to hang flags during commemorative holidays in the future, with the hope that the police would not interfere. Deputy Commissioner Rauberger indicated that he would relay the representatives' opinions to the Commissioner and respond again at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The three representatives then went again at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and discussed solutions with Commissioner Haber: (1) The arrested individuals would be released immediately; (2) The national flags at the police station would be retrieved by the Ratepayers' Association with a letter; and (3) Regarding the request for citizens' freedom to hang flags without interference, as this was not within the police station's authority, a request should be made directly to the French Consul-General.

Shops Comply with Advice and Announce Reopening

After the interference with the flag-hanging incident occurred in the French Concession, merchants and residents, motivated by patriotism, spontaneously closed their shops. A reporter from the Xin Sheng She visited the French Concession yesterday morning to investigate the closed shops. The areas with the most closures were from Rue du Consulat to Ba Xian Qiao. In addition, many shops on Ximen Road, Caishi Road, Route Cardinal Mercier, and Avenue Haig were also closed, expressing their determination to fight for national honor. Although the police authorities dispatched senior French police officers to various closed areas to persuade them to reopen, they refused to accept due to the lack of a satisfactory resolution to the case. Around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, upon hearing that the arrested individuals had been released and receiving the notices from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association urging reopening, many members of the Ratepayers' Association personally went to various shops to persuade them. They gradually reopened. However, due to the late hour, it was not possible to notify everyone, and it is expected that all shops will reopen this morning.

Release of Arrested Individuals

Over 30 shop owners, employees, or residents were arrested in the flag-hanging incident the day before yesterday. The number of injured could not be immediately counted as they were scattered in various locations. However, according to police sources, one Annamese policeman and one Chinese policeman were injured. After negotiations by the Ratepayers' Association, the arrested individuals were released in succession around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. It was reported that most of them endured hunger strikes while detained at the police station, fully demonstrating their patriotic zeal. However, two of the arrested individuals were initially not allowed to be released by the police due to their shouting slogans and writing slogans. After repeated negotiations, they were banished outside the concession.

Bank Association Consoles Fellow Banks

Due to the flag-hanging dispute in the French Concession the day before yesterday, various banks within the concession, such as the China Land Reclamation Bank, also raised the national flag, resulting in similar interference. The Shanghai Banking Association discussed this matter yesterday. While expressing condolences and sympathy to member banks that had been subjected to interference with flag-hanging, they also urged them to reopen first and await a resolution through diplomatic channels and matters of national importance. The banks, feeling the sincere encouragement of the association, resumed business as usual. It was also reported that the license of the Golden Gate Theatre was revoked but has been returned, and it is scheduled to reopen today.

Commander Xie's Letter to Compatriots Yesterday

Xie Jinyuan, Commander of the 800 Heroes regiment, issued a letter to compatriots yesterday regarding the crackdown on the display of the national flag, mainly stating: Yesterday, in response to the National Government's spirit of total mobilization movement, the citizens of the concession unanimously displayed the flag in commemoration, which was cracked down upon by the French Concession authorities, resulting in disputes. The national flag represents the dignity of a country, and every citizen has the freedom and right to display the national flag. Compatriots, your heroic and courageous actions, protecting the country, and supporting the supreme leader are deeply admired by the world. In my previous article "Reflections on the Past Year and Thoughts on the Current Situation," I said that from now on, Chinese people should uphold the principle of "national survival is the responsibility of every individual," each guarding their post, doing their duty to the fullest, taking the supreme leader's propositions as their own, taking their will as their own, and working diligently and practically to serve the country. Compatriots in the isolated island, as the year begins, I hope everyone will review the responsibilities they have fulfilled in the year and a half of the war of resistance. At a time when millions of frontline soldiers are facing death and hundreds of millions of compatriots in the war zone are displaced and destitute, can compatriots in the isolated island stand idly by because of their special circumstances? I deeply hope that compatriots in the isolated island will intensify their responsibility to serve the motherland, contributing money if they have money, and contributing strength if they have strength, to complete the foundation of national mobilization. Today, I sincerely appeal again to compatriots in the isolated island. The suffering we are experiencing today is the darkness before dawn. All evil atmospheres will be swept away with the great and glorious victory of the Chinese nation. I sincerely hope that compatriots in the isolated island will uphold the sense of national survival being everyone's responsibility, contributing money and strength, and with a spirit of quick action, hard work, bitter work, and practical work, take responsibility and fulfill their duty. I hope we can encourage each other.

### German Community in Shanghai Celebrates Hitler's 50th Birthday: Local NSDAP Leader Ehrmann Speaks, Extolling Hitler with Praises and Eulogies

Haitong News Agency Local Special Dispatch: Yesterday (the 20th) was the 50th birthday of Führer Hitler. The German community in Shanghai held a celebration at the German Building on Great Western Road. Approximately 1,000 people attended, including personnel from the German Embassy and Consulate, members of the NSDAP China Branch, and leaders of various German organizations. Ehrmann, leader of the NSDAP China Branch, delivered a speech, praising Hitler's achievements. He stated that never in history has there been anyone as enthusiastically supported and blessed as Hitler. At the same time, no leaders of any country have contributed as much to their nation as Hitler. When Hitler came to power six years ago, Germany was still in the midst of storms and turmoil. Now, it fears no threat from any storm. Ehrmann then strongly refuted the anti-German propaganda in various countries, stating that Hitler's policy has always been one of peace. Because he participated in the war for four years, he knows the cruelty of war and is determined not to start a war. Except for annexing Austria, Sudetenland, and Memel to save his fellow countrymen, there is absolutely no plan to annex the territories of different nationalities. This can be proven by the Munich Conference last September and Hitler's repeated guarantees. Ehrmann then discussed the annexation of Bohemia (i.e., the Czech Republic) and Moravia, as well as the relationship between Germany and Britain. He concluded by stating that Hitler's slogan is peace, and the tool for maintaining peace is a sharp sword. We pray that God blesses us and does not use the sword. But if Hitler is forced to use the sword to save Germany and the world, then we are ready to obey his orders at any time.

### Rice Reserves Increase, Market Prices Stabilize: Over 10,000 More Bags Compared to Last Period, Smooth Supply with Goods Arriving Continuously

The Rice Evaluation Committee, jointly formed by seven rice industry groups including the Bean and Rice Industry, completed its third survey of rice reserves on the 16th of this month. The total amount of rice reserves was 654,087 bags, an increase of 15,540 bags compared to the previous period. According to rice industry insiders, since rice industry groups persuaded merchants to purchase domestic rice, the supply has gradually become smoother. In recent days, shipments have been arriving by both land and water routes, averaging over 10,000 bags per day, and goods are still arriving continuously. Generally, cargo owners, seeing that the reserves and arrivals are abundant, are lowering prices for medium-grade and heat-sensitive goods to sell them off. Therefore, market transaction prices have been suppressed, and retail prices at various rice stores have also stabilized. Based on the current situation, it is estimated that Shanghai's reserves will continue to increase, and the future of food supply can be considered secure.

### Fishermen Urge Resumption of Ningbo-Dinghai Fishing Route: Fishermen's Livelihoods Ruined, Dinghai Severely Affected

The Preparatory Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Fishery Association telegraphed Gu, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee, and Huang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating: Since the 6th, the Ningbo River has been ordered to be closed. Now, during the fishing season, fishing boats are not allowed to enter, and their livelihoods are ruined. Some are tempted by the false fish market in Shanghai, which greatly affects the future of the war of resistance. The Preparatory Committee, based on the requests of representatives from various county fishery associations, telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission through the Association (Chairman) to promptly order the Ningbo Defense Command to investigate and allow fishing boats to pass through to benefit the fishing industry. It is also reported that Dinghai, with a population of over 400,000, has been severely affected since the shipping route was suspended. They submitted a request to the county government the day before yesterday to allow the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Dinghai, designating commercial ships to operate to facilitate transportation.

### Rumored Puppet "Mayor" Criticizes Concession Police, Raises Unreasonable Demands, "Protests" to the Consular Body and the Municipal Council Yesterday, Demands "Condolences" for the Murder of Xi Shitai, Disregards the Dignity of the Municipal Council's Police Force

Rumored puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an reportedly raised three unreasonable demands to the Consular Body and the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday (the 19th). The demands were absurd and bizarre. The following is an excerpt of his "protest" letter and the so-called three demands:

Suspects the Concession's Police Force

(Omitted above) Your Consular Body and Your Municipal Council bear a great responsibility for maintaining peace and order within the Concession. Xi Shitai, the secretary of the Police Bureau of this "Government," was shot by thugs near his residence at No. 12 Juyi Lane, Lloyd Road, Public Concession, at 9:15 AM on April 10. This "Mayor" sincerely regrets the occurrence of such an unfortunate incident. In view of the repeated assassinations in both concessions, which are of a seriously rebellious nature against the "new regime," and for the sake of maintaining "order" in Shanghai, this "Mayor" issued a serious "protest" on March 10 of this year. The main purpose was to severely prohibit such illegal terrorist acts and prevent similar incidents from happening again. Five demands were submitted for investigation and implementation. It has been many days since then, and no reply has been received, which is a lack of good faith and deeply regrettable. Now, this unfortunate incident has occurred again. This "Mayor" believes that Your Consular Body and Your Municipal Council lack sufficient "sincerity" in maintaining security within the Concession, and questions how your efforts to search for and prevent criminals are being carried out.

Raises Three Unreasonable Demands

Regarding the assassination of Xi Shitai, this "Mayor" specifically inquires about the responsibility of Your Consular Body and Your Municipal Council and makes the following three demands, hoping that you will maintain the full tranquility of the Public Concession in the future and provide a definite guarantee. The demands are as follows: (1) Regarding the repeated assassinations in the Public Concession, Your Municipal Council's regular bureau has made omissions in preventing such incidents from happening. Based on the facts of this unfortunate incident, this "Mayor" specifically asks Your Municipal Council authorities about the responsibilities they bear. (2) Your bureau has the responsibility to suppress illegal terrorist acts. Now, because you have failed to fulfill your responsibilities, this unfortunate incident has occurred. You must request methods to "console" the bereaved family of the victim, Xi Shitai. (3) This "Municipal Government" police, in order to eradicate illegal acts within the Public Concession, wishes to cooperate with the Municipal Council's police personnel in inspecting and investigating illegal organizations within the Concession. Please promptly reply to the above demands, together with this "Mayor"'s demands of March 10. This is my sincere hope. (Omitted below)

### Public Works Bureau Police Department: Promotion of Japanese Police Officers; Japanese Personnel Promoted to Foreign Police Department with Equal Status to British Personnel; Discontented Remarks from Foreign Police Department Personnel

According to the Continental Daily News, the Public Works Bureau Police Department headquarters in the Public Settlement issued a police order yesterday (the 19th) around 6:00 PM, changing the Japanese Police Department to the Second Team of the Foreign Police Department. This move means that Japanese personnel in the Police Department have been promoted to the Foreign Police Department, and their salaries have increased by more than 35%. What is particularly important is that, according to

the order's provisions,

Japanese police officers now have the qualifications to receive the same salary and status as British police officers. If they pass the prescribed examination, they can enter the First Team of the Foreign Police Department. Regarding the salary increase, Japanese police officers in the Police Department previously received 120 yuan per month. According to this new arrangement, they will receive 170 yuan per month, an increase of more than 35%, which is only 50 yuan less than the starting monthly salary of 120 yuan for new British police officers. However, if Japanese police officers pass the necessary examination, they can also receive

the same salary.

It is heard that the salaries of other ranks in the new team of the Foreign Police Department are also increased to the same extent. Last night, the police community discussed this new order extensively, and there were discontented remarks among the Foreign Police Department personnel. At the same time, all preparations for the implementation of the new order from May 1st have been completed.

### Rickshaw Pullers' Representatives Confer on Rickshaw Rent Issues

Accumulated Photo Fees of 240,000 Yuan

Proposed to be Allocated for Anti-Japanese and Relief Expenses

Since the rickshaw pullers opposed the rickshaw companies' rent increase and demanded a 30% rent reduction, all rickshaw pullers have unanimously responded. In order to strengthen unity, concentrate will, and unify organization, the rickshaw pullers specially convened representatives from various districts yesterday (the 19th) at 2:00 PM for an important meeting to discuss various action plans. In addition to detailed plans and thorough arrangements for the second step of response, the representatives also raised three issues for discussion: (A) The representatives believe that the past work has achieved considerable results and has achieved initial victory, but there are still many difficulties ahead. The representatives and all rickshaw pullers are determined to continue their efforts and redouble their efforts to achieve their goals. (B) The representatives believe that it is necessary to have an organized group at present. However, after repeated discussions on the issue of name, the representatives decided to use the "Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Association" as the organization representing all rickshaw pullers, and resolved that all expenses would be borne by the representatives, and no money would be collected from any rickshaw pullers to show credibility. (C) Since the "August 13th" War of Resistance, the Rickshaw Trade Association has not donated rickshaw licenses in the Chinese area, totaling 9,500 vehicles. The monthly license fee per vehicle is 1.28 yuan in national currency, and the monthly license fee should be 12,160 yuan in national currency. Calculated over 20 months, the association should have accumulated 243,200 yuan in national currency. Now that the association charges rickshaw rental fees at the original price of 0.77 yuan before "August 13th," and even illegally increases it to more than 0.80 yuan in most cases, it should pay the Chinese area donation to the government monthly as usual and remit it to Chongqing to cover the cost of the War of Resistance. Otherwise, it should also be issued to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to cover the cost of disaster relief. It was resolved to send a letter to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to make a suggestion, and to ask the association to actively negotiate with the trade association to collect the funds. Finally, it was unanimously resolved to submit another petition to the Public Works Bureau requesting that it uphold justice and accept the rickshaw pullers' demands as soon as possible to end the dispute.

### Chen Cipu of the Central Relief Committee Passes Through Shanghai

Chen Cipu, the former supervisor of students studying in Japan, was hired by the Central Relief Committee after completing his studies in Japan last year and has been working in Hong Kong for more than four months.

He arrived in Shanghai several days ago and took a boat from Shanghai yesterday. He is scheduled to return to Hong Kong after two months of inspection. The Central Relief Committee has telegraphed the local military and political leaders to assist with his inspection destinations.

### Shanghai YMCA Opens Vocational Lectures

Vocational youth in this city often cannot cope with their service due to insufficient knowledge and weak abilities, and they feel all kinds of difficulties. They want to increase their knowledge, but they have no appropriate methods in terms of time and economy. In order to meet this need, the Shanghai YMCA is now opening vocational lectures and has specially hired social leaders and celebrities to serve as lecturers every evening, such as Lu Gaoyi, general manager of the World Book Company, Ma Chonggan, editor of the Shen Bao, Huang Zongyu, professor of Jiaotong University, Li Quanshi, editor-in-chief of the Bank Weekly, and Tu Zheyin, professor of Daxia University, and more than a dozen others who are willing to provide sincere guidance. In terms of courses, there are 12 courses including industrial and commercial management law, magazine editing law, insurance management law, news interviewing law, practical commercial law, product marketing law, customs declaration and transportation law, advertising soliciting law, bank management law, foreign exchange law, import and export trade law, and library management law. Classes are held from 7:00 to 9:00 PM every Monday to Saturday evening at the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road. Each week is a term, and the tuition fee for each course per term is one yuan. The opening date has been set for May 1st. Registration can be made at the two YMCA locations. Briefs are available for filing. This is indeed an excellent opportunity for vocational youth in society to study.

### Directors of the French Chamber of Commerce Will Host a Banquet for the French Ambassador Tomorrow Evening; The Ambassador Expresses That the Chinese Government's War of Resistance Can Achieve Brightness; The Cordial Relationship Between China and France Should Correct Interference in Flag Hanging

The directors and all members of the French General Assembly of the French Concession on Huanlong Road in this city have been in Shanghai for nearly a decade since the arrival of the new French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme. In order to clarify the general situation for Ambassador Cosme regarding the situation of France in China, a public banquet will be held in the Assembly Hall of the Assembly at 6:30 to 7:30 PM tomorrow. Ambassador Cosme arrived in Chongqing on March 5th this year and presented his credentials to Chairman Lin. He stayed in Chongqing for five days and successively visited Chairman Chiang, Foreign Minister Wang, etc., and then went to Kunming on the 22nd. He transferred to Haiphong and arrived in Shanghai by the D'Artois gunboat from Hong Kong. This is the second time that Ambassador Cosme has come to China. In 1927, he was a member of the embassy in Beiping. He has always maintained friendly relations with the Chinese government. Regarding the future of China's War of Resistance, Ambassador Cosme said, "China will surely achieve the arrival of brightness." Unexpectedly, not long after Ambassador Cosme arrived in Shanghai, the authorities of the French Concession sent police to interfere with the hanging of flags in the concession, causing disputes and forming a temporary suspension of business. This is certainly not Ambassador Cosme's wish, and it is hoped that it can be corrected. It is heard that the shops in the French Concession have jointly appealed to Ambassador Cosme.

### Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings of Past Dynasties; Exhibition Period of Five Days

The Chinese Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition of Past Dynasties is an unprecedented group exhibition by more than 50 famous collectors in Shanghai. The famous works collected from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, reaching more than 350 works, are all masterpieces that represent the highest peaks of art of each writer's life and generation. Since the 18th, the exhibition hall has been expanded, works have been added, and more than 100 works have been replaced, and many rare treasures that were finally collected have been added. The tickets are still sold for one yuan each and are not increased. The number of people who came to visit in the past two days broke the record of previous days. The number of foreign guests who came was also more than in the past. The groups who came were Daxia, Soochow, and Zhijiang Universities, Jiangsu Provincial Normal School, which moved from Wuxi to Shanghai, Changzhou Middle School, Jiangsu Higher Court, Shanghai China and Huayi Banks, and the Chinese Business Securities Exchange, and more than ten other groups. As a result, the already expanded venue was still crowded due to the large number of people. The exhibition period was originally scheduled to end yesterday, but the association decided to extend the exhibition period for five days until the 25th and will not extend it again due to the enthusiastic demands of all walks of life and the consent of the collectors. Those who love art should not miss this last good opportunity. In addition, the association welcomes groups to visit during the exhibition period, but hopes to notify in advance in order to arrange the visiting time so that the number of people in the venue can be adjusted and avoid being too crowded.

### Five Students Go to Ningbo to Join the Army

Persuaded to Return Due to Young Age

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, there has been no shortage of patriotic people who have joined the army to defend the country. Now there are five students from the Shaoxing Shanghai Middle School, which is set up by the Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, namely Wang Lijun, 16 years old, Zhang Zuigen, 15 years old, Zhang Jiuru, 14 years old, Zhang Yousheng, 15 years old, and Cai Wenjun, 17 years old. All five suddenly disappeared on the 3rd of this month. After many inquiries, it was learned that the five students went to Ningbo with Lan Shijie, Yang Jiong, etc., intending to abandon their studies and join the army. After the school found out the truth, it was believed that the students were still young and needed to continue their studies, so it telegraphed Director Yu of the Ningbo Police Bureau to ask the police to pay attention. At the same time, it sent investigator Gu Xun to Ningbo to supervise. They have been found in the World Hotel on Jiangzuo Street in Ningbo. After persuasion by Director Yu, they have returned to Shanghai by boat with investigator Gu.

### Japanese Soldiers Suffered a Miserable Defeat in Guanyintang Town; Guerrillas Attacked from Both Sides; Dozens of Japanese Soldiers Killed and Wounded

Guanyintang Town, Qingyi, west of Xinjingdian in northwestern Shanghai, was originally the base of the guerrilla force of the Seventh District Chief Wang Shilong. Unexpectedly, at about 8:00 AM on the 16th, about 60 to 70 Japanese and puppet soldiers of the garrison commander Matsuoka's troops stationed in Xujing Town on Qinghu Road, led by Zhu Juren, the puppet "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" of Panlong, went to Guanyintang Town to search. Wang Shilong knew about it in advance, so he moved all his troops to ambush in the villages south of the town to cut off their retreat. At the same time, he sent a flying message to Gu Fusheng's troops, the district chief and guerrilla squadron leader of the Eighth District, to attack from the north. On that day, after the Japanese and puppet soldiers arrived, they searched the residents of the town door to door. As a result, they found nothing, so they set fire to more than ten houses of the Zhang family. When the flames soared, the two district chiefs Gu and Wang immediately gave an order, and the brave soldiers from the north and south attacked from both sides, using machine guns and hand grenades to kill and attack. The Japanese and puppet soldiers responded in a hurry, firing back. After a fierce battle for about an hour, the Japanese and puppet soldiers were defeated and retreated to the south. After walking about half a mile, they approached Dujiazhai, and the ambush soldiers of Wang Shilong's troops, who were ambushed there, also rushed out from both sides. The Japanese and puppet soldiers were caught off guard, had no intention of fighting, and fled in all directions in a mess. In this battle, more than 40 Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed and wounded, and two portable machine guns and more than 20 rifles were seized. Some Chinese also sacrificed their lives for the country.

### Puppet "Director of the Unified Tax Office" Yang Qiguan Stabbed with a Knife; A Strong Man Broke into the Bedroom in the Early Morning and Struck Four Times, Life in Critical Condition

The anti-traitor blood case that occurred at 4:40 AM the day before yesterday at No. 101 Yuyuan Road (No. 109 in the Chinese area) was caused by Yang Qiguan, a Cantonese man who was the "Director of the Taxation Office of the Ministry of Finance of the Reformed Government," also known as Jing'an, 52 years old, who owned a private car No. 4816. In the early morning of the day before yesterday, when Yang's family was fast asleep, a strong man broke into Yang's bedroom on the third floor from the balcony of the neighbor, pulled out a sharp knife and struck Yang in the face, head, neck, and right hand. When he saw Yang's child crying loudly, the strong man calmly left. Afterwards, Yang's family sent Yang to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, and then transferred him to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. His life is in danger.

### Qin Songru Embezzles Fines; Embezzled 1,400 Yuan from a Woman and Should Compensate the Plaintiff for Principal and Interest

Qin Chunru from Ningbo previously committed rape of a dance girl in the Yangtze Hotel ballroom. Because Qin Chunru failed to appear in court after being summoned by the Special First Court, he could not be arrested, so the case is still in suspension. Now, Qin Songru has been accused of

embezzling 1,200 yuan from Zhang Lv, a woman (Hao Zhang Embroidery Record), in the Criminal Court of the First Court. Zhang Lv had known Qin Songru for a long time. She had 1,400 yuan in the Bank of China. When the war broke out in September 1937, she planned to move back to her native Ningbo and needed money to use, so she entrusted Qin Songru to take the

deposit out of the Bank of China on her behalf. At that time, Qin immediately gave her a check for 1,400 yuan. However, because she could not cash the check, Qin volunteered to

exchange it for cash on her behalf. Unexpectedly, after Qin obtained the check, he disappeared. After searching for a long time, Qin finally claimed that the money had been used by him and

begged her to

repay it in installments, and made a note as proof. Then, except for the 200 yuan that had been repaid, the remaining amount has not been repaid to this day. She had no choice but to hire lawyer Ni Guangzu to file a lawsuit against Qin Songru in the Special First Court for embezzlement, requesting that he be punished in accordance with Article 335, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and incidentally

file a civil lawsuit

requesting that he be ordered to repay 1,200 yuan in national currency and the statutory interest from September 6, 1937, to the end of the execution. This case was heard yesterday by Judge Zhong Qing. Qin Songru also surrendered to court for questioning. After questioning by Judge Zhong, he ruled that Qin Songru should be fined 100 yuan, and if he was commuted to labor, he would be converted to two yuan per day, and he should also return 1,200 yuan to the plaintiff and the statutory interest.

The fire spread to the interior of the room, and the raw materials were all flammable. Once on fire, it was out of control.

### Describing Obscene Men and Women, the Editor is Fined 100 Yuan

### Young Man Unemployed Reports Poisoning

Wu Jinxiang, 26 years old from Haiyan, Zhejiang, has been unemployed recently, which has caused him to feel thorned and suddenly have a pessimistic view of the world. At 8:00 PM on the 19th, he went to the Tongshang Inn at No. 184 Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession and opened Room 10, claiming that he was borrowing a place to stay. He committed suicide inside that night. The next day, the tea room found that he had been dead for a long time. A pair of trousers was tightly wrapped around his neck on the bed. On the table in front of the bed, there was an empty glass bottle of medicine. It is speculated that the deceased seemed to have taken poison and then strangled himself to death with a pair of trousers. He immediately reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. A suicide note was copied from his body, which only contained numbers such as his cousin Chen Xiangzheng, who lived at No. 8 Hongning Lane, Caishi Road. The body was then sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Morgue. At the same time, the deceased's cousin was notified to report to the Special Second Court today to send someone to inspect the body.

### Renovation of Qingyuli; 3,000 Tenants Will Face Homelessness; Tenants Request Mediation on Their Behalf

Qingyuli tenants' representatives Qian Daifo, Ping Jinya, Qian Zhuyu, Zhang Mulian, Zhang Qilian, Shen Jiaping, Wang Yunquan, Zhang Jingxing, Liu Yaomei, Zhang Nianchun, Fan Chunyuan, and Fan Bozhou jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Federation of the First Special District yesterday, saying, "We respectfully inform you that our entire tenants received a letter from the Women's Bank Management Office in May of the year of cloud, stating that we have fulfilled a treaty with others, and the original houses must be renovated, please relocate, etc. After discussing among our tenants, we replied that since the outbreak of the 813 War in Shanghai, refugees from the interior have come to Shanghai to seek refuge, and the place is overcrowded. Where can we relocate? As for the renovation of the houses, it is not necessary at this time. Our tenants really cannot obey, etc. After the letter was replied, the bank still insisted on the previous proposal and continued to request relocation. After being rejected by our lane, it was not properly negotiated. On the one hand, it filed a lawsuit in court. Our tenants, standing in the position of the defendant, had to argue according to reason. After the judgment, it was deemed that the plaintiff had no reason to dismiss it. The Women's Bank, because it lost the lawsuit, appealed to the Second High Court. After many twists and turns, it has won the lawsuit in court. Thinking about it, there are more than 280 households in the entire lane, with a population of more than 3,000. After this panic, everyone is at a loss. Not only individuals will suffer from the hardship of relocation and displacement, but it is feared that it will affect social order. How can it be imagined? We have long admired your association's concern for public peace and request that you act impartially to mediate."

### Xinghexian Cigarette Exchange Branch Manager Arrested for Embezzlement

Judge Jiang verified the words and instructed that the case would be rescheduled for trial in a week.

### Japanese Army Kills Innocent People Indiscriminately

Recently, the Japanese soldiers in Zhabei have been strictly checking the residents, fearing that guerrillas are lurking. If they encounter people without residence permits or who they think are suspicious, they do not ask for the reason and falsely accuse them of being guerrillas and take them to the headquarters for questioning. For some reason, around 5:00 PM yesterday, they tied up a man, about 30 years old, who looked like a worker. Four Japanese soldiers escorted him to the Yizhong Cemetery on Yuyingtang Road and shot him. First, they tied the man's eyes tightly with white cloth, and then ordered him to kneel on the ground and shot him three times, killing him. The body was buried in the ground at that place. According to witnesses, in the past month or two, the number of innocent men and women who have been shot and killed in that place is no less than hundreds, almost every day. However, women are only a minority.

### Robbery of a Pair of Diamond Earrings Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison

Old Mrs. Weng Xie, from Chaozhou, is the female owner of the Tianxing Pawnshop on Wangzhi Road. On the 9th of this month, while riding in a rickshaw through Caishi Road, she had a pair of diamond earrings snatched from her ears by robber Wang Baosheng and others. The diamond earrings were worth 1,400 yuan. Wang Baosheng and others took them to a pawnshop on Shanxi Road and pawned them for 400 yuan, which they split and spent.

This is not consistent with the facts. Upon investigation, the aforementioned goods have never been mortgaged to our bank and are purely a kind of entrusted item. Therefore, we have no way of knowing its contents. Our bank has absolutely no connection with it. Accordingly, we are writing to inform you and hope that you will check and make corrections.

Sincerely,

The China Reclamation Bank, April 20th

### The Scope of the Anti-Aggression Alliance

— Mao Lie

The world today has reached a point where one hair pulled affects the whole body. Whoever wants to close themselves off and watch the slaughter from the clouds cannot do so. Even trying to acquiesce to other countries, pretending to be agreeable, is not permitted by the facts. Only by throwing oneself into this great whirlpool, floating and sinking with the world, and turning either left or right, joining one side, can one no longer remain neutral. The United States, which has always ignored European affairs, now has Roosevelt repeatedly declaring intervention and has clearly joined the side of the democratic countries, which is proof of my view.

This means that now, every country must state its attitude and have a way to handle itself. Therefore, at the same time, the combination of several countries, such as an anti-aggression alliance, should accommodate as many like-minded countries as possible, without regard to strength, size, distance, or any other relationship, hesitating, lingering, or indecisively rejecting people at the door. The reason is simple: since it is a combination to resist the other side, the greater the power, the better, and the more allies, the better. I have repeatedly said that the anti-aggression alliance should expand its scope for this reason.

However, the extension of the anti-aggression alliance to the Far East is even more necessary. I have already said this before, and now, according to the Associated Press, British MP Hantson is also making such a claim: "Since the anti-communist axis has one end in East Asia, the new collective security system must include both the East and Europe to be effective." In addition, British diplomats also believe that "If the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are the second stage of establishing an anti-aggression front, then the addition of China and other Asian countries to the anti-aggression front will be the third stage." Yes, so-called anti-communism is aggression, and the self-proclaimed anti-communist countries in the Far East are already aggressing. To prevent the aggression of any country and to seek world peace, how can the Far East, especially China, be abandoned and not included in the anti-aggression alliance!

Chamberlain, when asked by Henderson whether the British government has decided that China and other Far Eastern countries need to join the anti-aggression grand alliance, replied, "Britain is very willing to consider this issue." I hope Chamberlain will indeed consider this issue and give it a positive decision, because this is indeed the touchstone for whether the anti-aggression alliance can be effective.

As for China, I believe that we are naturally happy to join this alliance, because we are now engaged in thorough anti-aggression. What's not to like about being invited to work together!

### Marching in the Snow

— Zhi Yin

The sun densely hides in the depths of the mountains, revealing a trace of grayish-white light. The sky presents a terrible deathly gray, as if to swallow this huge ground. The surroundings are gloomy, like the eyes of giant beasts stretching out their claws to prey on food.

The north wind blows from the gaps in the mountains, from the branches of the trees, from the river surface, the plain, from all directions, rolling over the mountains, rolling over the trees, rolling over the plains and rivers, spreading its wings and sweeping, sweeping the darkness and silence of dawn.

At this time, there is only one kind of light, shimmering on the earth, a kind of jade-like white, crystal-like pure brilliance, as soft as wild duck down. Oh! Look! Looking out at the winding circle of mountains, a layer of silver-white things is spread flat, the broken stones on the mountains become beads of various shapes, and the withered branches suddenly seem to be full of pear blossoms, and a kind of lush white pear blossom that has never been seen before, the petals seem to be woven from silver threads. The road has also become a road paved with jewels, or a brand-new carpet covered with white down... Oh, that's snow, that's the light of snow. Surrounded by shimmering silver-white, the stream is particularly green and lovely. The clear green is like a moon in the stars, dignified, holy, and charming.

Faintly, the sound of the bugle rings out, the notes dancing with sadness and sorrow, movingly drifting in space.

In the distance, a large string of grass-green ranks appears, slowly moving forward, that rank appears on the mountain peaks, appears in the mountain gaps, appears on the opposite mountain... seemingly endless, appears in the mountains.

Far away, the sound of horses neighing can be heard, drawn out long, carrying a heart-wrenching desolation.

Apart from this, there is no other sound, only the slight rubbing sound of straw sandals stepping on the snow!

The congealed air is only dispersed a little, the surroundings are still gloomy, and the earth is still half-awake, with sleepy eyes.

On the mountains, on the road, countless messy, uneven footprints appear, slowly approaching, and the footprints become more and more numerous, engraving scars on this large piece of whiteness.

The sun gradually reveals a little red light from the depths of the mountains. The red sunlight shines on the white snow, changing the trees, mountains, and ground into pale pink clothes, like a magic-colored world.

Open your chest and take a deep breath of the morning air, fresh and fragrant, directly into the viscera. The whole body is bathed in the faint light of dawn. The cold seems to have diminished a little, and a feeling of joy and comfort that light is about to come arrives. Tens of thousands of people raise their heads, tens of thousands of hearts resonate with the same feeling. Dawn, dawn is about to come, China's victorious dawn is about to come.

Tens of thousands of people, all from the remote South. Today, they are ordered to transfer from the southeast battlefield, after a long trek of thousands of miles, crossing mountains, passing through long bridges, highways, and railways, to the north of the Yangtze River. Tens of thousands of people hold the same faith and the same aspiration. Today, they are about to begin a difficult and distant march, without any fear or fear, because their eyes have already seen the light of the motherland's victory.

Snow, for these healthy men from the South, is a novel thing. They have never seen anything so bright, so white, so clean, so soft. It is simply a dream scene, a myth. Most of them have never left home. Only a few have followed the army on the northern expedition twelve years ago, seen snow...

"Swish, swish, swish, swish..." Tens of thousands of people are marching in the snow, the sun is shining with warm light, the sky is no longer a deathly gray, and the gloom around it has also been dispelled. The light of the snow, the light of the sun, are intertwined into a bright and victorious omen.

"Swish, swish, swish, swish..." The ranks are moving forward.

The bugle is sounding again, majestic and solemn.

### Digging Trenches

— Fan Zhi

Now our guerrillas have become very powerful, and the Japanese troops are feeling uneasy day and night. News of attacks is constantly entering the enemy's camp, and they are all fearful and can only dig deep trenches and build high fortresses to strengthen their defensive work. Therefore, the need to dig trenches has become urgent.

Digging trenches requires a large amount of labor, so they go to the countryside and forcibly drag people into labor everywhere. When they arrive at a house, they see a man, whether old or strong, and tie them up with clumsy hemp ropes, one after another, string after string, pulling them away.

While walking on the way, they are not allowed to shout or cry. If they violate these two "orders," they will be given a good beating. If anyone tries to escape, they will be shot immediately. After arriving at their destination, each person is given an iron hoe or hoe, and they are ordered to start working and digging in the designated place, digging and digging continuously!

In the evening, it is time to rest. The place to sleep is the trench that they have dug with their own labor. Moisture and cold wind are constantly attacking from above, and water and mud are chilling their hungry skin below. Hungry stomachs and tired bodies huddle together in piles, and it is uneasy to stand, sit, or lie down. There will not be a minute of sleep all night.

Before dawn, they are ordered to work again: dig! dig! Dig continuously!

As for eating, there is only one meal a day, and each person has only one bowl of rice, weighing only four taels. Not only is there no dish, but there is no soup, and there are not even chopsticks. So, should we grab it with our hands? No! Their "order" is that they are not allowed to grab it with their hands, but can only "lick" it with their mouths like a dog eating shit! Whoever dares to grab it with their hands will be stabbed with a bayonet immediately, which is still a "light punishment," and sometimes they will be shot!

When it is time to urinate or defecate, they are not allowed to leave the trench a step. The "order" is to "excrete" in the trench.

While working, they are not allowed to talk or laugh, and even crying is not allowed. The "order" is to be silent! Whenever they see a Japanese supervisor coming, whoever sees them must bow and smile. Otherwise, it will be considered impolite and they will definitely be slapped twice.

Anyone who dies because they cannot bear the hard work, hunger, and cold, or who violate the "order" and are beaten or killed, the "order" does not allow burial. The corpses are used as soil and piled on top of the trenches, considered to be thickening the earthen fortifications.

In short, the compatriots who are dragged away are all sacrificed in the trenches: working in the trenches, sleeping in the trenches, urinating and defecating in the trenches, and dying and being buried in the trenches! It is a pity that there are still some unburied compatriots who are still forced by the enemy to dig for them! dig! Dig continuously!

### Not a Single Link Can Be Loosened

### Don't Often Gaze in the Mirror

— Guo Nidi

The rhythm of the universe cycles endlessly,

Twenty-four hours continue day and night.

The youth that fades away can never return,

Don't often gaze in the mirror at your beautiful face.

Life is originally a broad and diverse stage,

The myriad forms of living beings each reach the extreme of ugliness and beauty.

Playing the fool, inserting jokes, fulfilling your duties as much as possible,

Without extravagant desires, without troubles, and without indifference.

Understanding the simplicity of the essence from complex phenomena,

In this way, the journey has a fixed path to follow.

Otherwise, the earth and stars will collide in chaos,

And all the myriad things of nature will perish together in an instant.

Don't often gaze in the mirror at your beautiful face,

The youth that fades away can never return,

Beauty is a sign of premature aging,

Only wisdom can radiate eternal light.

### On the Peak

— Liu You

Crossing the dangerous and steep slopes, stepping onto that rugged mountain path, like earthworms, lying under the thorns, like little snakes winding.

Unmindful of danger, forgetting the hardship, people who have stepped on the side of this mountain all have the expectation of reaching the peak. No one wants to stop halfway up the mountain, even if there are deep ravines, dangerous cliffs, and all kinds of dangerous roads!

The peak stands tall between the clouds, it is the bud of people's hope. Even if climbing is the most difficult thing in the world, but in order to have a majestic destination, nothing can diminish people's courage!

On the peak, you feel that the world is too small, the valleys at the foot of the mountain are too dark, and all the base, evil, ugly customs and behaviors and concepts of the world have flown out of your heart!

On the peak, there is only sublime and light!

### The Mission Completed From One's Own Position

— Xiao Chun

Comparing the material conditions of military equipment: It was originally very arduous and difficult for China to fight against an aggressor who had been plotting for decades. However, since the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident, China has been fiercely fighting with the aggressor in this difficult and arduous environment for twenty-one months. Not only has the main force of the resistance not been defeated, but the overall situation has also been getting better. This cannot but be said to be a proof that spirit overcomes matter, and it is also a proof of the greatness of the Chinese national spirit.

"A sheet of loose sand," this is a traditional insult to the Chinese nation by Westerners, and the aggressors are precisely under this estimate of "a sheet of loose sand" that they are exerting their aggressive ambitions, fully expecting to swallow up this old and large China in a short period of "three months" or "half a year." Unexpectedly, under the influence of revolutionary doctrine, our Chinese nation has long been forged from "a sheet of loose sand" into a golden city of copper walls and iron walls. In the current environment, everyone knows that to obtain international freedom and equality and complete the mission of the revolution, it is necessary to break free from hardship and difficulty. Therefore, although the material conditions are simple, our spirit of struggle is becoming more and more vigorous! Before the aggressor's ambition has been abandoned, the Chinese people will never kneel before the artillery fire!

The fact is that the greatness of spiritual power has already consumed a large amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the aggressor in the past twenty-one months, and has made it fall into a dilemma of advancing and retreating. Logically, everyone should firmly believe in the certainty of final victory, but a few people with fear of Japan, such as Wang Jingwei and his ilk, still disregard the greatness of spiritual power, and do not hesitate to sell their souls and personalities in a humble manner, repeatedly publishing his fallacious theories of advocating peace. This is truly extremely insane. This time, the central government is promoting a general mobilization of the spirit. On the one hand, it really wants our compatriots across the country to reflect on themselves: are all words, actions, and life serious and in accordance with the provisions of the twelve national covenants? At the same time, on the other hand, it wants every Chinese compatriot to shoulder the mission of saving the country, first thoroughly eliminate the pseudo-resisters in our own ranks, and then unify our steps and launch a general counter-offensive against the aggressor. Therefore, in his speech on the 17th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek regarded the implementation of this national spiritual mobilization as "the most important event related to the survival of the country, the vitality of the nation, and the success or failure of the war of resistance."

However, after we have implemented the general mobilization of the spirit, and our compatriots across the country have launched a counter-offensive posture, the traitors and aggressors will inevitably show the dying throes of their panic. Under this circumstance, we should firmly believe, not be tempted by profit, and not be afraid of threats to not give up our mission. And we cultural people, especially, should be persevering and unyielding, and under the spirit of not fearing death, not fearing hardship, and not fearing difficulty, we should do our best to verbally criticize and write articles against the aggressors and traitors, completing the mission of our position.

Shanghai has always been the center of culture. Although under the siege of evil forces, there are a few dregs in the cultural circle who are doing the treasonous deeds of recognizing thieves as fathers, but the arduous struggle of the majority of cultural people is also an undeniable fact. The traditional spirit of scholars who "would rather have their heads cut off than surrender their will" is still gloriously maintained. However, we cannot consider ourselves satisfied and relax our responsibility, but should work harder to complete the glorious mission on our position.

### Regarding the Prohibition of Hanging National Flags

— A Citizen

Regarding the misunderstanding caused by the French Concession authorities prohibiting the hanging of national flags on the propaganda day for the industrial and commercial circles during the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week the other day, it is indeed an "unfortunate incident." Because in the process of our China's war of resistance, in addition to the biggest enemy and its allies (such as Germany and Italy), Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries are our most friendly friends. And peaceful and democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, whether their governments or their people, have given us more or less help in spirit and material. Therefore, we can only regard the prohibition of hanging national flags as an "unfortunate incident" caused by a misunderstanding.

In fact, further speaking, the Japanese imperialists' attack on China is not simply to destroy our China, but to further "unify" the world by him. This has been clearly revealed in Tanaka Giichi's "Memorial." Recently, Japan changed its "northward advance" to "southward advance" because it bumped into a gray nose in Zhanggufeng, Soviet Union. Hainan Island was already occupied first, and Xinnan Island was occupied later. These are very disrespectful acts towards France. With the gradual implementation of the "southward policy" and the transfer of the US fleet to the Pacific, from these concrete facts, our China's war of resistance is not only for the survival of our nation, but also for the protection of the interests of Britain and France? "China is fighting for Britain," this cry from a British government member still echoes in everyone's ears today. Therefore, our China's war of resistance does not hinder the interests of other friendly countries. On the contrary, only Japan's occupation of China hinders the interests of major democratic countries in the Far East.

Now, in various occupied areas, an anti-British movement is swelling, and all puppet newspapers are emphasizing the idea of "anti-white people." The so-called "anti-British movement" actually includes movements against democratic countries such as France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. From this, it can be seen how great Japan's ambition is. Therefore, democratic countries such as Britain, France, and the United States should not only sympathize with our war of resistance in spirit, but also need to assist our war of resistance materially. It is even more inappropriate to prohibit our flag-hanging to express the general mobilization of our national spirit, and should be sympathized with and helped.

However, "unfortunate incidents" always occur due to "misunderstandings." On the one hand, we certainly express our admiration to the compatriots in the French Concession who are fighting for the freedom to hang the national flag. At the same time, we hope that this "unfortunate incident" should not be expanded. We must know that we currently have only one enemy. We should have sincere discussions with the French Concession authorities about the misunderstanding of prohibiting the hanging of national flags, so as to avoid the occurrence of the same "unfortunate incident" again. At the same time, we must not give the enemy and all traitors and Trotskyites an opportunity to use them. The traitors will say, "Look at the white people!" A Trotskyite will say, "Down with all imperialisms." We must not be fooled, so as not to divert our attention. We hope that our compatriots will pay attention to it, and we also hope that the authorities in the French Concession will pay attention to it. Saying that prohibiting the hanging of national flags is to avoid "accidents," then the result will be exactly the opposite, and it will instead produce "accidents."

### Black Umbrella Bandit

— Ru Hua

"Black Umbrella Bandit" (Ambush) is like an ordinary detective film. It writes about a bandit robbing a bank, and finally solving the case and capturing the bandit leader. The reason why it is called "Black Umbrella Bandit" is because the bandit leader's umbrella never leaves his hand and is used as a weapon.

If it is viewed as a detective film, it is too monotonous. Although it also has thrilling scenes such as using smoke screens, grabbing huge sums of money, car chases, plane escapes, and finally capturing the bandit leader, we have seen too many of these scenes. Moreover, the director is only narrating the story plainly, and it undoubtedly does not arouse the audience's interest.

What can be barely mentioned is that the younger brother Charlie, who is naturally lewd and likes to associate with bandits, is finally moved by his sister Jenny, who works as a female clerk in the Pacific Bank, which makes him feel ashamed and fight with the bandits in the plane, resulting in his death. Of course, we can still remember Father Flanagan's words in "Boys Town": "There is no bad boy in the world." Then, this is just the tail of reformism.

Lloyd Nolan, who plays the car driver Tony here, and Dorothy Lamour's "The Hurricane" were not proper. In this film, he returns to his old profession and can have a little more opportunity to act.

I can't remember what "Black Umbrella Bandit" actor Ernest Truex has acted in before. Here, he seems to fit the role and has the alert and calm attitude of a bandit.

### Impressions of "Kentucky"

— Li Zhihua

Richard Greene, the third generation of Robert Taylor (the second generation should be Tyrone Power), and Loretta Young have cooperated in "The Story of Alexander Graham Bell" before, and now they have cooperated in this color film "Kentucky". This makes people think of Loretta Young and Tyrone Power's cooperation in "Suez," and can't help but feel that "talented people come forth from generation to generation," and youth is easy to grow old, which seems even more obvious in Hollywood. Although Tyrone Power is still the "big lover" of movie fans such as wives and young ladies, the honor of starring in three blockbusters in a year ("In Old Chicago," "Alexander's Ragtime Band," "Suez") may be passed on to Richard Greene or his next generation.

Similarly, Hollywood's recent competition in shooting color films also illustrates its "ever-changing" nature. The tendency of color films to replace black-and-white films is certainly due to the inevitable progress of silent films like talking films, but what stimulates its progress is the invention of wireless image transmission. According to rumors, stereoscopic films have also been invented by a photographer, and Sondra Druin is already shooting them. Hollywood's (ever-changing) tricks are constantly innovating, and the rapid changes also illustrate that the transition of Hollywood's "dashing young men" from Robert Taylor to Richard Greene's third generation in a few years is not without reason.

Speaking of the film "Kentucky," we can easily think of "Romeo and Juliet." Of course, in terms of literary value, they are far apart, but the point of love eliminating family feuds is the same. The story of "Kentucky" tells about the feud between the Dillon and Goodwin families due to different political views during the American Civil War in 1861, which has not been eliminated even after it was passed down to their descendants. Finally, the feud was resolved because Jack Dillon and Sally Goodwin fell in love. The film uses a lot of breeding horses and horse racing. The spring suburban horse trials are very beautiful in the color film. The fate of "Kentucky" being shot as a five-color film is probably determined by these horses.

What kind of impressions and feelings do we have after watching "Kentucky"? Maybe I think too far and too absurdly. I think of our KMT-CPC cooperation. Because Jack Dillon's training of the Goodwin family's "Blue Grass" (horse name) was victorious, this illustrates the benefits of cooperation, a result of a spirit of cooperation. This makes people think of the mission and inevitable victory of KMT-CPC cooperation in this holy war. Of course, some people may say that this is too absurd, but as an important explanation of the cooperation of discarding prejudices and old feuds, this "Kentucky" has a trigger for people to think of this point.

The director is not very strong. From the perspective of "art for art's sake," the handling of the scene in which John Dillon shoots Thad Goodwin is not bad. From Thad's being shot to the young Peter Goodwin chasing John Dillon's horse while crying and scolding, the atmosphere is very tight. Bob Watson, who plays the young Peter Goodwin, also performs very well; but looking at the whole play, I don't like this kind of handling. He plants the seeds of hatred too deeply, making the subsequent resolution of the feud become Jack and Sally's youthful ignorance. Of course, this top-heavy problem is due to the lack of power to handle the following scenes well, but the audience's impression is always like this.

Loretta Young performed well. I like Richard Greene in the few scenes when he appears. He has a bit of youthful vitality. Later, that kind of "dashing young man" look reminds me of the foreign prodigals I often see in Shanghai dance halls, and I don't like it. Bob Watson, who plays the young Peter, and Walter Pidgeon, who plays the old Peter, are very good.

### Life Report - No Reading in Bookstores Allowed

— (By)

I have been a trainee in a bookstore for more than three years, and my monthly salary is still only three yuan. Every day, I have to deal with retail sales during the day, and sort and distribute books at night. I can't rest until after eleven o'clock. I don't have any free time for my studies, so I want to take advantage of the slightly empty opportunity during the day to read a few useful books, but unexpectedly, I was scolded and reprimanded by the manager. Yesterday, I was fired by the manager for reading books and was on the road to unemployment.

The reason is this, according to a colleague, "The manager is calling us to do business, reading is something that should be done in school. Moreover, if you read books, what does it look like to people? There are no rules for merchants!"

He continued to tell me: "You can't even borrow books - the books in the retail department - to read at night, because the manager will wrong you for stealing them when he sees them."

In fact, this kind of wrongdoing does exist. A few days ago, a colleague was fired in a similar situation. He was committing almost the same problem as me. Because he could not get permission from the environment, he sometimes had to do "irregular" things.

The so-called "irregular" thing is that when he closes the store at night, he always stealthily takes two or three publications to his bedroom to read, and the next morning, he stealthily puts them back. This originally did not cause them any harm, but if the manager or his appointed spy saw it, he would ask you to get lost!

After this happened, I had a small question, that is, when he was fired, the other trainees didn't find it strange; but the person who was fired told us when he left: "Friends! Sooner or later, you will also be fired." After that, this matter revolved in my mind every day, wondering: Did he commit other illegal things?

Yesterday, I really committed the same "mistake". I was summoned by the manager for a conversation, and as a result, I received the order to get lost. So I simply became bolder and argued with him, and what I got was the reason that "reading books is not allowed in bookstores."

Through years of practice, I have come to understand that bookstores are also a kind of despicable store. They falsely bear the beautiful name of promoting culture, but in reality, they engage in the dirty business of selling their souls. (Of course, good bookstores are an exception.) If erotic books sell well, they sell erotic books. If there are subsidies, they publish publications that are beneficial to the public. No one can see through the boss's conspiracy.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 8: Is it Illusion or Reality? Acting on the Spot, It is Appropriate to Go or Stop, and Make a Home Everywhere

Wu Junsu, however, rented a house alone. Although she is from Suzhou, her large family lives in Shanghai. The house she is in now is shared by her and her sister. Because she has a younger sister named Wu Junke, who is still studying at Soochow University, the two sisters can just rent a house together. Wu Junsu likes excitement, and also loves friends. She immediately fell in love with the two Miss He and was especially compatible. Therefore, she specially invited them to her house to sweep the couch and wait. When Zhu Airen and others' cars arrived in front of her door, she was already at home, waiting for them for a long time. She was not only waiting for the three of them, but she was also waiting for Jin Danyu, who came from Shanghai. Zhu Airen and others arrived at her house and also saw her sister Wu Junke. This younger sister is five years younger than Junsu. She is a high-achieving student in the science and physics department of Soochow University and will graduate next year. Her face shape is also similar to Wu Junsu, but she is taller than her sister and is a healthy and beautiful youth. She is very outstanding in the women's ball games at school. Zhu Airen had already met this younger sister, but the two Miss He were meeting her for the first time. Although their house is not big, it is very delicately decorated. The downstairs room is a reception room, with sofas and chairs, and also Junsu's piano. This is her hobby and she is also a master. Like her younger sister Junke, although she knows a little bit, she is not as good as her sister. Among these ladies today, only He Shuangyu and Wu Junsu have the same hobby, and they can be considered soulmates. Because Shuangyu had also studied in the United States, but Shuangyu can't be considered a piano expert. The second floor is the room for the two sisters. Recently, because of entertaining guests, they vacated the second floor and moved to a pavilion to live in. The third floor was originally their study and their library. They do not hire maids, and all the affairs in the house are done by themselves. There is a public dining room for eating, so you don't have to eat at home, which saves a lot of trouble. If there are miscellaneous errands and other things, there are also people who provide public service. Zhu Airen and others had not been here for half an hour when they heard laughter and clamor outside the door. It was Jin Danyu who had arrived. Jin Danyu had been to Wu Junsu's house before, so she was relatively familiar. She also knew many people at school, and there were also old classmates inside. Danyu also came by train today. Although there are various means of transportation between Suzhou and Shanghai now, the train is still the most convenient. When she arrived at the train station, she hired a car to come. (91)

### Hollywood Movie Stars' Criteria for Choosing a Spouse

— Chun Xu

A French reporter specifically went to Hollywood to ask local male and female stars about the conditions for choosing a spouse (Note: This refers only to appearance, body, and character. Other conditions such as property, occupation, and education are not discussed).

According to the opinions of the male stars:

(1) They love women with golden chestnut hair, because most of these women are probably beautiful.

(2) They worship thin women (of course, not referring to women who are skin and bones and too weak). Women full of curves and the typical female athlete are not their ideal partners. There is a popular saying in Hollywood: "The curve is not the shortest path from one point to another, so this is not an interesting line." This sentence fully expresses the degree to which they hate muscular fullness.

(3) They love happy, cheerful, lively women with a slightly silly nature. Because marrying this kind of woman can make the husband easily comforted in daily life and forget the hard work. On the contrary, if you marry a woman who is sad all day long, it is no different from placing a machine that creates troubles and tragedies at home.

According to the opinions of the female stars on choosing a husband:

(1) They love to marry men with brown hair, because most men in the United States have brown hair. Men with black and dark hair are not popular with them, because too dark hair makes the face look unkind.

(2) They love tall, lean men with long legs.

(3) They love men with a natural attitude, not restrained, good at telling jokes, and with a heroic spirit. Silent, British gentleman-style men are what they consider the most boring things.

### Anecdotes of the Silver Screen

### Tidbits from the Broadcasting Circle (3)

— Bi Hua

(Continued from March 31. The author has been ill for many days, which has delayed the continuation of the manuscript. Please forgive the readers.)

Sha Buqi once ran a small newspaper a few years ago. His eloquence was indeed well-known in the tabloid world. He was a very strong debater and spoke eloquently. It is appropriate for him to run to the radio station to broadcast dramas and be welcomed. Unfortunately, he did not know how to advertise himself in the air. The purpose was to tell fortunes and predict destinies for people. He gave consideration to one thing and lost sight of the other. It is inevitable that he would be distracted from his inherent business - drama - and be affected by it.

Chen Pingqian is a drama practitioner. Of course, he has considerable experience. He is an old hand at shaping wheels and is indeed extraordinary. During the heyday of drama, he was also a strong general under the leadership of the late drama tycoon Zheng Zhengqiu. Recently, he has also been living a broadcasting life. Because he has a foundation in learning, it is not easy for him to be able to mix in the broadcasting circle to this day.

Ji Fansan's background is singing drama. He has filmed movies. He has a large body and can make the voice of a little girl. He has not been defeated for a long time and is still standing still. He also occupies a considerable position in drama broadcasting.

Wang Yayu's drama can be called the most powerful and has the most programs on the radio station. It is a pity that the dramas he broadcasts are too old-fashioned. If he can change his purpose and find materials from the times and add hype, it will definitely add a lot of color.

Gu Xingping and Gu Yulian's father and daughter's drama has a long history and they are engaged in it seriously, which is quite popular with the audience. It would be best if they could come up with some new tricks.

Others, such as Xu Qingfeng, Shen Shuofeng, and Yuan Zhifei, are all outstanding talents who broadcast dramas on the radio. The author believes that the dramas on the radio are almost all the same, with little difference. If they can engage in rectification and reform the script, then the audience will definitely express sympathy. If this continues without seeking reform, the audience will get tired of it over time, and I am afraid it will be difficult to be welcomed.

### The Original Meaning of the Western Name for "Pygmalion" (賣花女)

— Xin Liang (新良)

The humor master George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion" (賣花女) has finally been released at the Cathay Theatre (國泰大戲院) in this city. From any perspective, we can know that this film will certainly attract general attention. The film's ingenious plot, light and pleasant dialogue, and the well-matched cast are all top-notch. Here, allow me to explain the original meaning of the Western name Pygmalion (Pygmalion) for "The Flower Girl," to contribute to the readers.

According to legend, Pygmalion was originally a prince of the island of Cyprus (located in the eastern Mediterranean) in ancient times. He carved an extremely beautiful and exquisitely detailed ivory statue of a woman. As time passed, the prince became enamored with this ivory statue, to the point that he was restless day and night, unable to sit or sleep peacefully. Helpless, he pleaded with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, to transform the ivory statue into a living "person." Seeing his ardent love, the goddess granted his wish. At that time, Pygmalion married this woman and successfully completed a happy marriage.

According to the above, the prince fell in love with the ivory statue, and the goddess of love transformed the ivory statue into a living person... etc. are probably all so-called "myths." In "Pygmalion," Higglins is the incarnation of Pygmalion, and the flower girl Eliza is the incarnation of this ivory statue. The only difference is that Higgins does not fall in love with Eliza, but only intends to become good friends with her.

### A Visit to the Shanghai Bank Peking Opera Troupe Rehearsal

— Faisheng (吠聲)

I, the writer, was invited by Mr. Shen of the Shanghai Bank's Peking Opera Troupe to observe their second small rehearsal. I was delighted to witness it, and I will briefly record my impressions below: The rehearsal was scheduled to begin at 7:30 PM. I was delayed due to other matters, so when I arrived, Luo Cheng's Challenge (羅成呌關) was already coming to an end. Following that was The Fa Men Temple (法門寺). Originally, Mr. Zhu Zaichen (朱再岑) was to play Liu Jin (劉瑾), but because Mr. Zhu was suffering from a stomach ailment, he was unable to perform on stage. Mr. Yun Baocheng (惲葆丞) temporarily took his place. His acting was solid and experienced, his dialogue was clear and fluent, truly only someone with a deep understanding of the craft could achieve that. Miss Xu Zuixia's (徐醉霞) Song Qiaoji (宋巧妓) was also quite impressive. Most commendable and valuable was Mr. Qu Hongxiang's (區鴻翔) Zhao Lian (趙廉). In addition to his accurate pronunciation and vocal delivery, his expressions were also fully expressive. As a Cantonese person making his stage debut (Mr. Qu is from Guangdong), achieving such results was truly unexpected. If he continues to work hard on his acting, one can predict that he will join the ranks of famous amateur performers in the future. Next was Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao (打鼓駡曹). Mr. Wu Zhaonan (吳照南), playing Cao Cao (曹操), possessed both a tall and imposing figure and a loud and resonant voice. Mr. Sheng Zongcai (盛宗才), playing Mi Heng (彌衡), was gentle and refined, worthy of a scholar, and a sense of frustration was particularly evident in his eyebrows. The drum-beating scene was even more brilliant. Finally, there was Si Lang Visits His Mother (四郞探母). Mr. Du Tairan's (杜泰然) Yang Yanhui (楊延輝) had the best voice in the entire troupe. The long passage of Xipi (西皮) during the sitting in the palace scene (坐宮) was extremely gentle and tortuous. Ms. Zhou Sunxiu (周孫秀), playing the Princess (公主), had a dignified appearance and graceful demeanor. The long passage of Xipi she sang was also very pleasant to the ear. Miss Shen Xiaohu's (沈曉湖) Empress Xiao (蕭后) had a style reminiscent of Furong Cao (芙蓉草), so it's no wonder she won a full house of applause. Mr. Shen Muda's (沈慕達) Zong Bao (宗保) had an excellent appearance, accurate pronunciation, and his "yao qiang" (要腔) and stage poses were as skillful as someone with years of experience. It's a pity his voice was weak. Mr. Zou Binji's (鄒賓吉) Sixth Brother (六郞) was accurate in every aspect. Unfortunately, the drummer made a mistake on the drum points temporarily, which led to him forgetting his lines when he personally went down to untie Si Lang's shackles. This was probably due to being nervous on his first stage performance, focusing on one thing and losing sight of others. It was a minor flaw. Mr. Shi Bingyong's (石秉庸) Dowager (太君) had a lot of expression on his face, adding a lot of color to the whole play. Mr. Zhou Sizhong (周思忠), playing the young barbarian (小番), drew a black mustache all over his face to prevent the small mustache from being seen by the audience, causing the audience to laugh, which was also amusing. Most admirable was the spirit of cooperation within the troupe. For example, the president, Mr. You Boqun (游伯羣), and Mr. Pu Enluo (濮恩犖), played officials in this play. The stage manager, Mr. Chen Baode (陳寳德), after starring in The South Heaven Gate (南天門), played extras in several plays. They shared the spirit of unity and cooperation regardless of class. Therefore, I am happy to record it as above. I heard that the troupe also plans to hold a public performance to raise money for disaster relief, which is to combine entertainment with charity, which is truly commendable.

### Interesting News from the World of Entertainment

### After Viewing the Exhibition of Chinese Paintings and Calligraphy Through the Ages (Continued)

— Chen Dieye (陳蝶野)

Liu Haisu (劉海粟) calls himself an art rebel. After forty, he frantically collected Chinese paintings. His innate brushstrokes are close to Shi Tao (石濤) and Bada Shanren (八大), but the scroll of Ni Yuanlu (倪元璐) listed at the exhibition is the best. Haisu once obtained Huang Shimmo's Pine Scroll (黃石磨松卷), which would have been a perfect match for this. Why wasn't it displayed together? Shi Tao's large-scale painting seems to have been repainted. It remains the same as before. What is the reason?

Xu Bangda's (徐邦達) collection is as exquisite as Cong Yu's (蔥玉), but Cong Yu is a collector, while Bangda is a painter. Bangda is skilled in painting, so his collection is different from Cong Yu's. If the Winter Green Pavilion Map (冬靑館圖) by Wang Meng (王蒙), the Nine Songs (九歌) by Zhang Wo (張渥), and the Landscape Scroll (山水卷) by Dong Qichang (董玄宰) all demonstrate his eye and skills, which is different from someone with a broad and unfocused love. The Cotton (木棉) painting by Sun Ai (孫艾) is purely a sketch of flowers, elegant and unique, which is different from the Shi Tao Huang Mudan (黃牡丹) which seems mundane in comparison.

The Nine Peaks Snowy Mist Map (九峯雪霧圖) collected by Huang Huanglou (黃黃樓) has been recorded since the Ming and Qing dynasties. Dong Qichang (董　臣), Hu Yunxiang (虎惲香山) all seemed to have originated from this. Now looking at the original, Zhu De (朱得) can be considered Zhao Mengfu's (趙孟頫) best work. However, Zhao Mengfu's painting has already returned to heaven. The existence of a corner in the world is like a unicorn or phoenix, let alone a complete six-foot piece? Huanglou does not cherish elite works and shares it with the public. His merits can be said to be immeasurable. Compared to those who hide treasures in their homes and never go out, can they be mentioned in the same breath? The calligraphy of Wen Zhengming (文徵明), Xu Wei (徐渭), Hai Rui (海瑞), Li Tengfang (李騰芳), Huang Daozhou (黃道周) and other scholars are all from Huanglou, which particularly wins my heart. Cheng Mengyang's (程孟陽) Autumn Forest Walking with a Staff (秋林策杖圖) can also be considered the wine sacrifice in the association of nine friends (九友祭酒). If a piece by Ma Yuan (馬遠), then it's all from the Ming people.

Fang Congyi's (方從義) Stream Bridge Seclusion (溪橋幽興) collected by Pan Boshan (潘博山) and Guo Bi's (郭畀) Imitating Gao Mi Cloud Mountain (仿高米雲山) collected by Lin Erqing (林爾卿) are both unparalleled works of the Yuan Dynasty. Fang is ancient and elegant, even better than Guo's scroll. I watched it for half an hour and couldn't leave. Boshan has many legal books in his collection, but few were exhibited in this meeting, which makes people feel tired.

Wang Jiquan's (王季銓) Wang Meng's (王蒙) Secluded Residence in the Forest (林麓幽居) is slightly less spiritual than Bangda's Winter Green Pavilion Map, but it is also rare. Chen Hongshou's (陳洪綬) Mountain Bird Plum Blossom (山鳥梅花) is clumsy and ancient. Jiquan has a rich collection, but he exhibited very little, which made me feel the same as Boshan.

Diechao's (蝶巢) Ni Yunlin's (倪雲林) Green Water Map (綠水圖), Zhou Yuqing's (周雨靑) Wu Xiaozhen's (吳小　　) Evening View of the Lake (湖晚眺), Zhu Qizhan's (朱屺瞻) Sun Kehong's (孫克弘) Mountain Temple Misty Mist (山寺烟霧), Xu Junqing's (徐俊卿) Xiang Shengmo's (項聖謨) Snowy Landscape (雪景山水), Sun Bangrui's (孫邦瑞) Wang Shigu's (王石谷) Cold Pond (寒塘　　) are all fine works. I have three regrets about this meeting. One is that there are no representative works of Wen Zhengming (文), Shen Zhou (沈), Tang Yin (唐), and Qiu Ying (仇). The second is that the Four Wangs (四王), Wu Li (吳), and Yun Shouping (惲) were not satisfied with what was on display. The third is that there are too many mediocre works by Zhu Da (朱盡), and I can't bear to part with them after Qianlong and Jiaqing (乾嘉以後). There is one hope. In the past, many collectors were unwilling to publicly display their exquisite collections. It wasn't because they were stingy, but because the displayers were often careless and didn't know how to cherish them. Once displayed, the table surface was often contaminated. If you want to re-mount it heavily, the spirit of repeated mounting will be exhausted. If you leave it in a mess, your heart will be unhappy, so you often fill the capital with medium-quality products. However, this exhibition was mostly meticulously managed by Bangda. Not only was it displayed and dusted, but it was also cherished very much. In the era of human generations, it was able to be arranged in an orderly manner. If there is no question in your chest, how can you get to this point? Collectors can be happy about this. It can be predicted that later works will compete to display their collections and satisfy the eyes of people.

Correction: In yesterday's text, line 13, "Hua Su Xiaomei Yuan (華蘇小妹圓)," "Hua (華)" is a mistake for "Meng (夢)".

### Finance: Cash Tianjin Gang Longs Unwind

Yesterday's spot silver (烚赤) and unofficial market conditions saw a slight increase in the range of fluctuations. The situation was slightly higher first and then lower. Initially, the price went up to 2,077 yuan due to a certain silver shop buying on behalf of customers. Then, because the securities firms, on behalf of the Tianjin Gang, sold all the long positions they had taken on Saturday last week, and a certain silver firm also followed suit, and because the buyers were not strong enough, the market weakened suddenly. By noon, the price even fell below the 70 yuan level, retreating to 2,069 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, the momentum stabilized slightly. It was heard that the buyers were willing to absorb at 70 yuan, but the sellers' intention to sell weakened, saying that they would only be willing to sell if it was 71 or 72 yuan. As a result, it fell 6 yuan compared with the closing price at noon on the previous day. The morning trading was still strong, about 700 taels. There was no trading in the afternoon. Silver jewelry also fell by 1 yuan. Customs gold remained flat. British pure gold, etc., rose again.

At 9:40, a certain silver shop was seen buying 100 taels from a certain money exchange shop on behalf of the Tianjin Gang, with the opening price of 2,077 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than the previous closing price. After the opening, the securities firms also sold a large amount on behalf of the Tianjin Gang, and the potential trend suddenly turned downward. The securities firms sold 50 taels to the silver shop firms at the same price as the morning opening. Then, it sold another 50 taels to a certain silver firm at the price of 75 yuan. Later, it sold another 50 taels to a certain silver shop at the price of 74 yuan. At that time, there were fewer and fewer buyers, so the downward trend intensified. The securities firms then sold 50 taels to the silver shop firms at the price of 71 yuan. Later, a certain silver firm sold 130 taels to a certain silver shop on behalf of customers at the price of 70 yuan. Immediately, a certain silver firm bought 50 taels from the silver shop at the original price. After that, the securities firms sold another 50 taels to a certain money house at the price of 70 yuan. At the same price, Jin Hao also sold 50 taels to the money exchange shop. Near noon, the silver shop firms sold 50 taels to the money exchange shop at 69 yuan, which was the closing price at noon. The market was quiet in the afternoon. Supply and demand were both scarce. Later, a certain money exchange shop suddenly wanted to buy, bidding 70 yuan, but the sellers were all waiting and watching. Until after 4 o'clock, they still did not find an opponent, resulting in no trading. If calculated according to the noon closing price of 2,069 yuan, the result was a drop of 6 yuan compared with the closing price last night. The difference was 8 yuan for the whole day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 2,075 yuan, and the buying price was 2,065 yuan. The current bid gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading.

### Oil Cakes and Raw Soybean Oil: Buying Interest Revived, Market Prices Saw New Records Again

The raw soybean oil market conditions are difficult to fall because all sales venues are supplied from one place in this city. Therefore, the industry buys when the price is low. The Japanese firms recognize the goal, implement manipulation, and are quite able to respond to needs.

380 packages of soybeans were transported to Shantou on the 21st, and 610 packages were transported to Hong Kong.

### Yarn Flowers: The Yarn Market Resembles a Tug-of-War, Brisk Sales Turn Sluggish, with Many Short Sellers Covering, and Large Dealers Maintaining Support by Absorbing Warehouse Receipts.

The yarn market initially weakened then rebounded, resulting in uneven prices. This was because actual demand was weaker than before. Although Hong Kong and Yunnan merchants were buying, their volume was shallow, not as robust as in previous days. Shantou purchases had stopped, so some short sellers were selling off their positions in the market, causing the market to weaken. However, many parties believed that the supply of spot goods was not particularly loose, and their attitude remained bullish. As a result, the market resembled a tug-of-war. Later, some colleagues intervened, buying several hundred bales of warehouse receipts, which boosted market sentiment.

Regarding the current yarn situation, the market opened weak in the morning. Trading was slow to start until 10:00 AM. In reality, customer sales were not strong, and acceptance from various parties was not smooth. Furthermore, those who had been allocated spot goods tickets were eager to sell, given the sluggish spot market. They immediately lowered their prices by one yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 401 yuan. However, demand remained scattered and weak, and customer purchases were scarce. The market price gradually declined, with the spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn breaking the 400 yuan barrier, closing at 399.5 yuan. The warehouse receipt price was 393.5 yuan. However, 10-count coarse yarn not only did not decline but instead advanced. 32-count and 42-count yarns also remained stable. In the afternoon, some colleagues, attracted by the cheap warehouse receipt prices, suddenly came to buy, taking in about 200 to 300 bales, causing immediate tension in the market. Prices immediately jumped by two yuan, to 395.5 to 396 yuan. Spot prices followed suit, with the closing price at 402 yuan. As a result, the price of 20-count "Female" yarn fell by one yuan, the price of Double Horse yarn remained unchanged, and the price of Extra Grade All Yarn fell by 2.5 yuan. The price of 10-count coarse yarn rose by about two yuan. It was found that all parties bought a total of 1,140 bales throughout the day. The Yong'an Factory released 300 bales of 10-count Special Jincheng yarn at a price of 338 yuan, for delivery from June to August. Today, 410 bales of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin, 80 bales to Yantai, 910 bales to Shantou, and 1,020 bales to Hong Kong. The transaction volume for each party is listed below:

### Good Transactions in Coarse Yarn, Constant Orders for Indian Cotton from Factories

Regarding foreign cotton prices, New York cotton prices have risen sharply by more than 20 points in the past three days due to short covering in May. Distant months were therefore slightly pulled up. Yesterday, the situation was more moderate. Although May rebounded by 5 points, other months saw small declines of 3 to 5 points. There is still no definite news from Washington regarding future cotton industry policies. The US cotton export figures have not improved, and cloth sales are very sluggish. This is because everyone involved in the cotton industry is taking a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 20 points. Converted to legal tender, US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 4 jiao, Indian cotton fell by 4 jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 1 yuan.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, various factories had small transactions, mainly in "Ping Guo Er" cotton, because coarse yarn transactions were more active and "Yao Hua" cotton could not be transported to Shanghai for sale. "Bai Luo Qu" cotton was second most popular, and "Peng Jia Pu" cotton transactions were rare. Yesterday, Hongzhang bought 300 bales of "Bai Luo Qu" cotton, Anda bought 500 bales of "Ping Guo Er" cotton, and Defeng bought 1,000 bales of "Ping Guo Er" cotton. There were no transactions from other factories. The converted factory delivery prices for yesterday's cotton market are recorded below:

The local cotton market situation was similar to the previous day, with little change in selling prices. Defeng Factory still had some buying interest, but the volume was very small. Other factories showed no sign of activity. Trading among colleagues was also sparse. Various sources of supply were subject to various restrictions, resulting in a sense of scarcity. However, about three or four boats of "He Xia Huo Ji Hua" cotton arrived, totaling about 700 to 800 bales (each bale weighing 120 jin). Due to the unstable situation in the Subei area, only 66 bales arrived. Today, 30 bales were exported to Shantou and 50 bales to Hong Kong. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded below:

### Silk and Tea: Silk Exports Become Prosperous Again, White Factory Opens with a High Bid of 1,800 Yuan

Regarding foreign silk markets, New York and Lyon reported further increases yesterday. Japanese silk rose by 4 points at both 83.75 and 75 points. The exchange's near-term prices rose by 8.5 points, and distant prices rose by 0.5 points. Lyon's Japanese silk rose by 2 francs, and Shanghai silk rose by 1 to 1.5 francs. Only Yokohama silk prices saw weak spot sales at the original price and distant prices falling by 27 yuan. Judging from yesterday's silk market, where US prices rose and Japanese prices fell, the recent surge in silk prices seemed to have reached its maximum limit. The US market's unique firmness yesterday was likely due to speculative short covering.

In the local silk market, exports were prosperous again yesterday. Da Chang and Yihe both received large payments. The White Factory opened with a high bid of 1,790 to 1,800 yuan, with transaction volume reaching 300 to 400 dan, a phenomenon rarely seen amid repeated silk price surges. According to yesterday's selling prices, they have risen by 100 yuan compared to three days ago (Monday this week). Yokohama spot prices, on the other hand, have only risen by 65 yuan in these four days. Therefore, the Shanghai market can be described as having both high prices and high transaction volume, changing the old pattern of "missing opportunities" and marking a new era in silk market operations.

### Grains: Tianjin Impurities Abound, Local Flour Sales to the North Are Obstructed

Flour: Spot flour transactions at local factories were very sluggish yesterday. Customer sales were reported to be quiet. Northern merchants found it unprofitable to transport flour because the Tianjin exchange rate had fallen sharply, and the local market was affected by an abundance of mixed foreign flour, which hindered the sales of Shanghai flour to the north. Southern merchants were still clearing their previous orders, making it difficult to develop new transactions. As a result, the market was dull and lifeless. Factories initially intended to lower prices for customers, but because customer sales were quiet and foreign flour prices were unwilling to fall, there was no need to compromise. As a result, the price of No. 2 flour remained at the original price of 4 yuan and 4.5 jiao. It was reported that some returned goods were discounted by 5 fen, but this was not considered a formal market price. Total market transactions, excluding retail sales in the local street, were about 7,000 bales. It was found that today's flour exports were 100,800 bales to Tianjin, 33,700 bales to Shantou, and 4,500 bales to Yantai.

Foreign Flour: The foreign flour market gradually cooled yesterday. According to overseas telegrams, wheat prices have fallen slightly, but distant foreign flour prices remain unfavorable. Therefore, those holding goods insisted on their prices and were unwilling to compromise. However, the local market was saturated, and northern merchants, due to unfavorable exchange rates and the abundance of local foreign flour, showed little interest in Shanghai flour or foreign flour. As a result, the market was quiet on both the supply and demand sides, and buyers and sellers held their positions. The selling price of mid-range brands was still 4 yuan and 2 jiao to 1.5 jiao in cash, with only scattered transactions.

### Du Geng Customer Sales Are Clear, Hot Weather Makes Rice Susceptible to Change, High-Grade Rice Returns Down by One or Two Jiao

Yesterday, the sources of supply from He Xia did not arrive, and only 2,000+ bags of "Che Lun Bao Zi" arrived from the Su Tong region. The hot weather makes the rice quality susceptible to change, which caused the local market and hoarding households to be dull. City wide trades were few, most goods were not sold out. Market has declined with plenty of returned goods conflicting with each other. Ruo Hou Geng prices declined by 1 Jiao to beyond, while Bo Dao also declined a few points to 1 Jiao. Du Yang Jian & Bu Jian were hard to establish a foothold, also decreased by 1 Jiao, there were few asking about Bian Yuan. The market therefore was void of trades.

Although customer shipments were lacking to reach docks recently, small retail tickets were continuously loaded by Che Lun, but the Shanghai warehouses had an abundant stock, customer transformation has long stagnated, walking/warehouse entry has become even lighter. The market then daily declined, and floating warehouses/scattered households plotted to sell. Yesterday, the secondary grade customer goods within the market immediately sharply decreased by 2 Jiao, high grade goods also slightly decreased by beyond 1 Jiao. Wuhu Geng were only opening at 12.7 Jiao, the secondary was around 12 Jiao, while Zhong Guan rice was only at 11.2/3 Jiao. City wide trade was still only beyond 1,000 bags, while Yang Rice inventory has been depleting, new fixed prices were unfavourable, the goods provider was decreasing the price but unwilling to become to lax over it.

### Piece Goods: Sichuan Merchants Add to Orders for Colored Cloth, In Significant Quantities, East Piece Goods Transactions are Scarce

National Cloth

Trends toward stability, sales from each market is weak, but still without interruption. Chongqing merchants add to their orders for coloured cloth/twill, quantity rather numerous, totaling 5-6,000 pieces. Shantou merchants add to orders of coloured twill/poplin/coloured cloth, 60+ boxes. Wenzhou merchants trade white goods/coarse cloth the most, trade of each brand 13/14/16 pounds for several hundred bales, while households along the street drag in Yihe's coarse cloth, light and heavy weight for an additional 400+ bales. Coarse cloth sale disks continue to be firm, compared to the other day, each piece rose by 5 Fen. Fine cloth/Fine Twill, because each Chinese factory inherited/wove raw cloth, production quantities were all reduced, market inventory was thin, trade although sparse, market plate was steady. Yesterday, Jiangsu north, and dye factories purchased 100+ bales, Guangdong merchants traded fine cloth 30 bales, households choose Shen Xin Xin Yu & Yong An 3 textile factory produced fine cloth/fine twill and continuously searched for purchase, traded 100+ bales, the sale disk for the 3 factories was especially good, each piece continually increased 5 Fen to 1 Jiao, bleached & dyed cloth, sale disk was stable.

East Cloth

Fine Cloth/Fine Twill continuously stagnated, morning market each piece declined 1 Jiao, later market slightly rebounded, result compared to the prior day declined roughly 5 Fen, customer trades was as sparse as morning stars, colleagues along the street and dye factories continually traded 5/600 pieces, market conditions within slackness, still more or less firm. Itou foreign firm收進 12 pound longtou fine cloth 200+ bales, each piece price depended on 13 Yuan to 13.05 Yuan.

Exports

Piece goods was transported to Tianjin 280 pieces on the 21st, transported to Yantai 350 pieces, transported to Shantou 200 pieces, transported to Hong Kong 330 pieces.

Wan Li Ding is Currently Popular

Wan Li Ding Er Ba has been sequentially placed on the market, because the sales are timely, the general west clothing tailors along the street, all have purchased, Yuan Chang brown grey & pure white beige, sale is broad, especially those with hidden green & light grey colours, demand is even greater, standard market price, the west goods cost is extensively high, trends will also, compared to last year, be extremely high. Yesterday, Meichen's lotus princess traded for 8 Yuan clear disk, Hao Shi brand 7 Yuan 1 Jiao.

### Sugar Market: Chaoqing Rises by Two or Three Jiao

Yesterday, coarse white was slightly tight. The association's planned price for 24-count stock at the local warehouse was 26 yuan and 3.5 jiao, with 50 bags traded. Transshipment goods were 18 yuan and 2 jiao to 1.5 jiao, with over 400 bags traded. Taikoo Che Bai called for a 5 fen increase, with spot goods at the Western warehouse at 26 yuan and 2 jiao. Domestic sugar only opened with a high price of 15 yuan and 3 jiao for Huanggangqing, and 15 yuan and 1 to 2 jiao for ordinary Mianchi, with a total of several hundred bags traded. On the 20th, 200 bags of sugar arrived from Shantou. (It was mistakenly published on the previous day that the opening price for Pianqing was 11 yuan. This is corrected here.)

### Medicinal Materials: Bai He Pian, Smooth Sales to Shantou and Hong Kong

Bai He Pian (Lily Bulb Slices) were firm due to the continuous activity of Hong Kong merchants, and now sales to Shantou have become active again, causing prices to tighten further. It is found that stocks in the producing areas are limited, and the arrival of new goods is still far away. As on the previous day, a certain merchant wanted to buy but was willing to offer very little, raising the price by 2 yuan compared to the previous market. According to industry experts, those with slightly larger stockpiles seem to need to hold on to them.

### Imports and Exports: Jian Tai Ships 6,000 Pieces

In addition, 180 pieces of tobacco leaves, 8,000 pieces of native paper, 6,000 pieces of wood boards, 2,000 pieces of leather oil, and 4,000 pieces of native paper were imported on the 20th from Fuzhou.

On the 21st, 100 pieces of egg yolk whites were exported to Hong Kong.

### Metals: White Lead Skin Piece Price Inverted

Metal transactions have been quite quiet recently. Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other merchants have been unable to purchase due to the rising exchange rate, so most Zhuang customers are taking a wait-and-see approach. As a result, export business has decreased sharply. Local manufacturers and merchants from Fujian and Zhejiang have also seen fewer transactions recently, and the market has gradually become flat. Fortunately, market prices in various cities have been able to hold steady. However, there are still overseas orders being placed, such as tinplate at 11 gold yuan, pig iron at 7 gold yuan and 6 jiao, white lead wire at 47 gold yuan and 5 jiao, secondary white lead wire at 36 gold yuan and 5 jiao, new iron products at 8 gold pounds, 17 shillings, and 6 pence per ton, white lead skin at 22 gold pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence per ton, thin black iron billets at 50 gold yuan, and general black iron billets at 43 gold yuan and 5 jiao. In addition, telegrams have been received for various iron products, but there are few changes from previous quotations. Regarding the above prices, except for white lead skin, which is inverted by more than 10 yuan per barrel in the Shanghai market, other goods still have a slight profit margin compared to the current market. Therefore, orders for various metal products have been placed in quantities ranging from 50-60 tons to 200-300 tons. However, only 50 barrels of white lead skin have been ordered. The most active metal shops placing orders are those along North Suzhou Road, followed by those along Beijing Road and Xin Kai He, and then the small hardware merchants.

Traditional Chinese Medicine and Diet Therapy

### The Favorable and Unfavorable Progression of Measles Cough and Its Relationship to Nursing and Diet Therapy

— Yu Xuezhou

Recently, measles has been prevalent. Our publication has been well-received by readers since publishing articles on "Measles." Therefore, we are publishing several more articles by Mr. Yu to meet the expectations of readers. (Cun Ren's Knowledge)

Coughing is a necessary symptom of measles. If the cough is infrequent, occurring every few minutes with three or four coughs, is moist, and does not disrupt sleep, it will not affect health and will not change the course of the measles. The physiological function of coughing is to remove obstructions from the respiratory system, expelling them from the body with the force of the cough. Coughing in measles can also help the rash to erupt. Unless it is very severe, it is beneficial and harmless, and there is no need to administer cough suppressants to eliminate it. If the coughing is frequent and unproductive, or if the throat is sore and painful and the voice is hoarse due to excessive coughing, or if the stomach is shaken and vomiting occurs due to severe coughing, the situation may seem tense. However, if the eruption of the rash is not affected, and breathing is even without shortness of breath or rapid breathing, proper treatment can prevent major problems. If coughing is accompanied by rapid breathing and nasal flaring, or if coughing persists after the measles, these are unfavorable signs that require careful attention!

Colds can cause coughs, so those with measles should avoid wind and cold. However, excessive protection, such as tightly wrapping the sick child in heavy blankets or placing a stove in the room, can cause internal heat and coughing, which can also be very dangerous. Customarily, red dates are burned and placed in the sick child's room to "smoke" it, supposedly to speed up the eruption of the measles. However, dense smoke is most likely to irritate the airways and worsen the coughing. It is common to see people crowding into small rooms with already poor air quality, causing dizziness and nausea. If dense smoke is added, anyone with common sense can distinguish between harm and benefit. This method is especially unsuitable for children with severe coughs. Custom dictates that "no oil is used for frying" when cooking in a house with measles, in order to avoid the stimulation of oily fumes and prevent the coughing from worsening.

The occurrence of measles is often triggered by colds. An ancient prescription for erupting measles is to "decoct scallions in water, pour it into a basin, and fumigate the sick child over it." This method can also treat colds. By analogy, if someone with early-stage measles also has a cold and cough, boiling a few scallions, smashing them, and drinking the thin congee can relieve the cold and help the measles to erupt, achieving two benefits with one action. If the cough is caused by heat, it is often accompanied by a red complexion and rapid breathing, and the measles rash is dense and bright red. Cooling drinks such as sugarcane juice and pear juice are suitable. The degree of heat should be considered when determining whether to drink them cold or warm. Almonds, crushed with water to extract the juice, are also good. If the heat is severe, it can cause dryness and deplete fluids. Therefore, for a cough caused by dryness, with a dry cough and a glossy, red tongue, sweet and cooling sugarcane juice or pear juice is especially suitable. For a cough with a lot of phlegm, it is essential to eliminate phlegm. Radish can be juiced, and three to five drops of ginger juice can be added and taken warm. If the child with measles has loose stools, use caution. For a cough with a lot of phlegm, avoid eating greasy foods. Greasy foods should be avoided during the early stages of measles, and even in the later stages, when the rash has subsided and appetite has increased, greasy foods should still be avoided.

Whooping cough is a disease that children are very susceptible to. The cough has periods of remission, when the child is normal and shows no symptoms. However, when the cough starts, it is incessant, causing the face to turn red, veins to bulge, and forehead to sweat profusely, and it is difficult to cure. It often lasts for three or four months. Its period of prevalence coincides with measles, so it often occurs together, worsening the coughing and even leading to pneumonia, creating dangerous conditions. A simple prescription using Jian Lan leaves and Ci Xiao bamboo decoction has no proven effect. I often use Qing Yan Tan Wan to treat it. Children who take this medicine can have a clearer cough, and the duration of each cough can be reduced. The pill contains ephedra, which can also help erupt the measles. Even if there are already signs of pneumonia, it is beneficial and harmless to use it. Customarily, sweet and moist foods such as rock sugar and honey are often used for coughs, and are mixed with cough medicine. However, whooping cough requires promoting lung function, and sweet and moist substances are not suitable.

The most distinctive feature of measles cough is the symptom of "choking when drinking." There is no cough at all at ordinary times, but if milk, water, or medicine is given, coughing starts incessantly and then returns to silence. This phenomenon often occurs when measles turns into pneumonia. It is commonly said that measles should be accompanied by coughing, and that not coughing is an unfavorable sign. This is one example. In most cases, those with this symptom have a poor appetite and should not be forced to eat or drink. Treat the pneumonia to alleviate it, and then a sparse cough will occur. When there is no "choking when drinking" when fluids are given, the appetite will return, and then the issue of eating and drinking can be discussed. If the cough is severe and causes hoarseness, loquat blossom honey can be taken, one spoonful each time, twice a day. Or use one tael of almonds, soak them in hot water, remove the skin and tips, crush them with a cup of water to extract the juice, mix in half a tael of powdered raw aster, add a cup of honey, and decoct into a paste. Take half a spoonful each time, and take with thin congee.

A persistent cough can lead to consumption. After all symptoms of measles have subsided and the cough has gradually disappeared, if the cough persists, the limbs become thin, or there is tidal fever, it is a sign of measles consumption, which is not easy to treat. For diet therapy, use one pig lung, wash it thoroughly with clean water, add Ophiopogon japonicus, fritillary bulb, stemona root, aster, and Lycium chinense root bark and decoct and drink it.

### Garlic Kills Worms

— Wu Shanqing

Garlic is pungent and warm in nature and has the function of treating diseases. It has the effect of removing phlegm, stopping coughs, stimulating the appetite, cleansing and diuresis and promoting sweating.

However, because it is pungent and hot, and has a strong odor, it should not be eaten in excess. Overeating can cause a stuffy feeling, as it can stimulate blood circulation and easily trigger hot flashes, especially in those with yin deficiency. Ancient people said that eating too much can cause blurred vision and impair the spirit, which is why.

It is often effective for cold and deficiency diseases in people with cold and phlegmatic constitutions. It is especially effective as a worm killer because its pungent odor penetrates and increases intestinal peristalsis. The worms are stimulated and cannot adhere to the intestines, so they are excreted with the stool. Finely chop the garlic, take it with water or milk, or boil it in milk, or add it to drinks and food to treat worm diseases that are ineffective with other medicines, which is better than bitter and cold worm killers. It is best for children with worm diseases to take it. If it cannot be taken internally, the garlic can be mashed into a paste and applied to the navel and stomach, and the worms will come out. Eating garlic during cholera epidemics can prevent the disease and cleanse the large intestine. Regular consumption can prevent appendicitis. Western medicine allicin is made from garlic.

### Seven Star Snakehead

— Zhang Huai Lin

The vegetarian wife calls it the Seven Star Fish, which looks towards the Big Dipper at night. Its scientific name is Channa argus, commonly known as blackfish. Northerners call it 　fish. Snakehead fish are black. The large ones weigh more than two jins, and the small ones weigh about a jin. Their heads have seven stars. The gall of all mobile things is bitter, but the gall of snakehead fish is sweet.

Snakehead fish are mobile and like to live in water. Their muscles are strong and firm. Eating them can aid digestion and promote water circulation and promote production of body fluids. This thing does not die even if it is cut and killed, and it can still jump in the pot. It is produced everywhere, so its price is extremely cheap, so it is not valued. Lower-middle-class families often use it to make soup as a side dish.

Snakehead fish has a miraculous effect on treating edema. There was once a person suffering from edema who got a prescription: use one large snakehead fish, thirty scallion heads, and one piece of ginger. Boil it in half wine and half water until it is very soft and let the patient eat it, eating from head to tail, the upper part of the swelling will recede first, and eating from tail to head, the lower part of the swelling will recede first. Repeated tests have proven its effectiveness.

Snakehead fish gall is sweet and can treat throat paralysis. Long-term throat paralysis, swelling to the point of death when it occurs, can be cured by dabbing it with this gall. Those with deep illness should wash it with water and irrigate it, it will come back to life once it enters the throat.

Snakehead fish has a fat body and strong flesh, making it easy to feel full when eating, strengthening the bones and muscles, growing the muscles, and killing insects. It is also suitable after illness. It can be used to make pan-fried fried fish, steamed fish slice soup, braised fish, fish soup and other dishes, and can be eaten with winter melon to help urination and defecation.

### Lychee

— Guocai

Lychees are produced in Fujian, Guangdong and other places. The skin is dark red in color and has wrinkles. The flesh is delicate, white, soft, smooth and juicy, and the taste is sweet. No other fruit can compare. But this thing cannot be eaten too much, because it is quite hot in nature. If you eat too many lychees, it is easy to cause fever, thirst, dry mouth, nosebleeds, etc. At this time, you can soak the lychee shell in water and drink it to relieve it.

Lychees can only be eaten as fruit when they are small, and their pits and shells have medicinal effects. For example, if a woman suffers from blood and qi tingling pain, small intestine qi pain, heart pain and other symptoms, she can roast one or two lychee pits to preserve their properties, grind them into powder, and take them with wine. Or decoct them with Achyranthes bidentata, Psoralea corylifolia, Corydalis yanhusuo, Albizia julibrissin, fennel, papaya, Eucommia ulmoides, and tangerine seeds to treat hernia; add Phellodendron amurense for deficiency heat, and add cinnamon for deficiency cold. If the swelling is like a dou, take lychee pits, green tangerine peel, and fennel in equal parts, stir-fry and grind them, then take three qian with wine three times a day. It is extremely effective.

### Pregnant women should be careful with their maintenance: Drink Rehmannia Congee when "leaking blood"

— Ding Boan

From conception to delivery, a woman must go through a period of ten months. During this long process, the mother's blood must be dedicated to nourishing the fetus, so she naturally has no time to nourish other parts of the body, resulting in a pale complexion, fatigue, and lack of energy. At the same time, resistance is also weakened, so after pregnancy, you should always pay close attention to your daily life and food. In terms of movement, it is forbidden to lift high, lift objects, carry heavy objects, travel long distances, and engage in hard labor. In terms of food, avoid drinking alcohol, pepper, garlic, and other spicy and hot products in winter, for fear of disturbing the fetus and causing disease.

"It is easier to treat ten men than one woman." This sentence probably refers to the fact that women's diseases are hidden and complicated, and it is difficult to diagnose them. Treating pregnancy diseases requires even more thought. On the one hand, you must prescribe medicine according to the symptoms, and on the other hand, you must consider the fetus. What is more difficult is if you cannot take both into account in the condition. "Pre-natal medicine is about cooling," is an experienced medical saying, which means that doctors should use medicine that is biased towards cooling when treating pregnancy diseases. Pregnant women tend to have too much fire and heat in their bodies. Cooling medicines mostly have the effects of nourishing and moisturizing, which suits their needs, and the disease is easily cured.

Bleeding during pregnancy is called "leaking blood," which comes from blood heat. Treating it with Rehmannia congee is based on the above principle. Raw Rehmannia juice can nourish yin, nourish blood, cool blood, stop bleeding, and moisturize the lungs. Japonica rice has the effect of nourishing the middle and harmonizing the stomach. The method is to cook two he of japonica rice into congee, add four liang of Rehmannia juice when it is hot, mix well, and eat it on an empty stomach. Over time, the heat will naturally be calmed and the blood will stop. It is very effective, so don't ignore the rice because it is plain.

(The End)

### A Discussion on Milk (Part 2)

— Ding Jimin

Milk is hot in nature. This is a common saying. When we look at the records in the Compendium of Materia Medica, we cannot help but smile dumbly. The Compendium clearly says "sweet and slightly cold." "Sweet" means sweet, and "slightly cold" means cool. Apart from a slightly fishy smell, milk does have some sweetness. (As for the "cold" in "slightly cold", it relates to the entire pharmacology of traditional Chinese medicine. So I will not mention it here for the time being). Now, just looking at the literal meaning of the words "sweet and slightly cold," isn't it obvious that it is not hot? (Western medicine's analysis, apart from protein, fat, carbohydrates, ash, etc., and vitamins, does not have a distinction between hot and cold). So, is milk hot or cold in nature after all? Let me explain slowly.

We often see people from the countryside come to Shanghai, and the first time they ride a tram or car, they vomit and throw up all over the place. They must find it strange to see others standing in the car, free and comfortable, swaying back and forth, never falling down. However, when we go out and take a sea voyage, the thought of seasickness makes us miserable. Seeing the sailors and stewards are all lively and vigorous, without any pain, we are really extremely envious. In fact, it is not strange at all, it is just a matter of habit. For thousands of years, we Chinese have always been closed off, eating light tea and simple meals, vegetables, fish, and meat. Our intestines and stomachs have become very accustomed to digesting the above-mentioned items. Moreover, the ancients have always regarded milk as something eaten by barbarians. For example, in Li Ling's letter to Su Wu in the Han Dynasty, it says, "Greasy meat and cheese are used to satisfy hunger and thirst." Also, in Wang Zhaojun's lament when she married far away to the Huns, it says, "The yurt is the treasure, and felt is the wall. Meat is the food, and cheese is the drink." Both of them felt very uncomfortable eating milk and mutton, and expressed it in their poems and essays. Therefore, in ancient times, milk was not included in daily dietary items. Sun Simiao, a famous doctor and food therapy expert in our Tang Dynasty, had an argument in the twelfth volume of his book "Qian Jin Yi Fang." He said: "Milk is neutral in nature, nourishes the blood vessels, benefits the heart, grows muscles, makes the body healthy, strong, moist and shiny, the face bright and happy, and the ambition not decline; therefore, as a son, one must supply it as a regular food, not missing a day, and always making sure it is sufficient. This thing is far better than meat!" Although Mr. Sun published this experienced argument, it ultimately could not defeat the ancient Chinese idea of ​​honoring the king and resisting the barbarians, and finally the position of milk in the food and nourishment items was rejected by the scholar-officials.

Thus, milk, very unjustly, was cut off from the Chinese people for a thousand years. In the past hundred years, Western science has surged in like a tide, and so milk has also followed Western science and taken big steps to return to the Chinese food and nourishment items.
