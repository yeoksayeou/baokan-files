The Polish National Army is moving swiftly, scattering the German forces that have adopted a defensive posture and capturing many enemy soldiers. The German mechanized units that advanced towards the southern city of Bierać were met with a brave counterattack from the Polish army, which was very successful. The enemy abandoned many tanks and vehicles, and the soldiers inside were all captured. In addition, the enemy attempted to use airplanes and parachutes to transport soldiers and disrupt the Polish army's rear. However, after the local authorities and people quickly apprehended them, the enemy changed its approach, ordering its soldiers to wear Polish uniforms and parachute into the Polish rear. This is another clear demonstration of the enemy violating the laws of war. (Havas, 5th)

Another major fire broke out in the Warsaw City Market, one of the famous places in Europe, but this reporter was unable to immediately investigate because the air raid sirens were constant and there was no way to go out. Many streets in Warsaw were covered with more than an inch of broken glass and bricks. Stretchers were seen everywhere, carrying the wounded to hospitals for treatment. Women and children ran to escape on the streets when they heard the air raid sirens, not knowing what to do. A young woman was holding a birdcage, not knowing that the bird inside had already died. The Polish anti-aircraft units were very active. Polish planes also took off to engage the enemy, focusing their attack on the German planes that were bombing the train station.

Editorial

### Italy and the European War

After Germany opened fire on Poland, Britain, France, and Italy hoped to avert disaster and each made attempts to do so. More than 48 hours passed before Britain and France fulfilled their obligations and declared war on Germany. After Britain and France declared war on Germany, Italy still hoped to turn the tide and made further suggestions. On the evening of the 4th, it broadcast via radio, recounting the mediation process, saying that Britain and France accepted the suggestions and principles, but the German Führer resolutely fought. At this point, an Italian newspaper referred to the matter, saying that this statement was meant to show that it should avoid continuing to make efforts for peace. In recent years, European disputes have been rampant and crises have been frequent. Britain, France, Germany, and Italy have been the protagonists. Now, in the last moment of effort for peace, only Italy is able to remain outside of the vortex of war. The world is changing rapidly, things shift in the blink of an eye. Such a thing could not have been predicted even just weeks ago. Italy's talent lies in its Prime Minister Mussolini's ability to grasp reality, play all sides, rationally restrain his emotions, and control his people with authority. How else could it have reached this point!

Since the European war has begun, the United States has strictly adhered to neutrality, and the discussions in both the government and the public are the same. However, many commentators say that whether it can consistently maintain its original intention and remain neutral is still doubtful and worrying. Even with the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean and the thousands of miles separating Europe and America, Americans are still worried and doubtful. Italy and the warring parties such as France and Germany are contiguous, with roads connecting, the sounds of roosters and dogs heard between borders, and intertwining gratitude and grievances. Can it be said that it will be able to stay out of the fray afterwards, as it is now? Who can solve the current great mystery? This reporter does not want to force a solution, but rather to repeat the previous day's comment that "on the day when it has not yet been determined how to act, all judgments should be reserved, pending the development of all possible facts." Indeed, in the past two days, the news coming from the European continent and the Mediterranean has been fragmentary. The smallest sign or clue can be regarded as precious and gratifying, and it can also be said to show the trend of things. We are happy to say that there is new information that can be used for judgment. But no matter how accurate the judgment, how does it compare to the certainty of its actions? What can be said is that today's Italy is not only alone outside the vortex among the protagonists of the European situation, but also among the countries of the world, it alone has the broadest freedom to rise up and take the most effective action. This newspaper has previously commented that the world should take a fresh look at Italy, and now it is even more obvious. What is the most effective action? The effectiveness of action depends on power, as distinguished by time and space. The United States is truly rich and strong, and its actions truly have power. However, because there is a geographical distance between it and Europe, if it wants to exert power in Europe, it will also have a temporal distance. Where there is distance, the effectiveness of action will inevitably be reduced, which is not the case with Italy. The Soviet Union borders Poland and its military strength is stronger on land than at sea, so its actions in Poland should be most effective. However, the other party's main strength is in Britain and France. If the Soviet Union crosses the sea to attack Britain and France, there are many reasons to sigh at the ocean with nothing to be done, which is not the case with Italy. If the United States and the Soviet Union are still like this, there is no need to discuss others. If the European war lasts for a long time, the entire world will be divided into two major camps, which no country like Italy can control. If the European war is a rapid and decisive war in a relatively short time, then Italy's decisions and actions in a short space will make those who bear it immediately feel the pain, which is inevitable. What is the broadest freedom? The United States is limited by its political system. Even with the great talent and strategy of President Roosevelt, he cannot make quick decisions like Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Although there are some contradictions in policy and interests between Britain and the United States, it can be said that it is inherently impossible for the United States to side with Germany and confront Britain. Italy's relationship with Britain and France and with Germany cannot be judged by a single standard. As for the Soviet Union, it has a non-aggression treaty with Germany. According to the treaty, the Soviet Union cannot side with Britain and France and suppress Germany. Even if it is said that the treaty can be torn up, there is no reason to tear it up, and it is not enough to say that it is free. Moreover, the treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany is still a new creation based on national policy, so how could it be willing to break the treaty. Italy can at least help Germany through military alliances, and it can help Britain and France by advocating for peace negotiations. "Taking from the left and right has its source." Its actions are very effective and its freedom is extremely broad.

As this reporter writes this, there is a telegram from Rome, the capital of Italy: "Germany's military actions have made it believe that the understanding between Italy and Germany has been broken by the German side, and the guarantees given by Italy are therefore no longer binding. Italy, in this situation, has decided to 'currently' maintain its neutrality." Declaring neutrality towards the war is a passive action. However, given that Italy has been mentioned and allied with Germany for several years and has finally become neutral, its influence on the European war will definitely not be a passive meaning. This move was not unexpected, but was repeatedly and vaguely indicated by this newspaper. However, in terms of the general international situation, it is a major international change, which can even be said to be more significant than the sudden signing of the non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany. However, international affairs are constantly changing, and even though we have obtained this more precious and updated information, we should not go beyond reality and make too many inferences. Italy's neutrality, although a clear signal and an important change, has only declared neutrality and abolished the binding force. "Currently" it is only neutral, and in the future it will have complete freedom of action. It should not be judged that there will necessarily be other further actions to follow. However, I would like to ask Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, for the sake of human welfare and for the sake of promoting justice and establishing lasting peace, should Italy not exert its power to shorten the war? It is firmly believed that Italy has effective methods to shorten the war!

### Statement by Crew Members of Bombed British Ship: Circumstances of Distress and Rescue

German Ship Also Sunk by British Warship; Greek Ship Strikes Mine, German Explanation

(London) Many crew members of the British ship "Athenia," sunk yesterday by a German submarine off the west coast of Scotland, arrived in Greenock today. According to reports, after being hit by a torpedo and exploding, the ship immediately tilted and the stern sank. People on the ship waited quietly in lifeboats for eleven hours before being rescued. It was witnessed that a lifeboat carrying seventy people fell from the davits, a height of thirty feet, into the sea. Most of those on board were women and children, and many were injured. The German submarine fired a torpedo without warning, and only after the explosion did the submarine rise to the surface, about one hundred yards from the "Athenia." Finally, a Norwegian ship arrived to rescue them, but its propeller struck a lifeboat, causing it to capsize. All fifty-two women in the boat fell into the water. (Reuters, 5th)

(London) After the sinking of the British mail ship "Athenia" by a submarine, all the surviving passengers have been transported to safety by various national ships. Mrs. Turner, an American citizen who recently came to England for a holiday, was also on the ship returning home. She was fortunate to escape after the disaster and has now returned here. She said, "At the time of the incident, I was standing on the deck, facing the direction of the submarine. Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and the ship shook violently. I fell down. When I opened my eyes and looked around, several passengers had already been killed in the explosion. The crew immediately lowered the lifeboats, and I and most of the passengers rushed in. However, because the boat was small and crowded, seawater was seeping in very quickly. Just when we were in a state of extreme danger, a destroyer suddenly arrived and rescued us all. It was truly fortunate." According to crew member McNair of the "Athenia," "The torpedo fired by the submarine exploded near the engine room, making it impossible to save the ship. About 25% of the over three hundred Americans on board perished. There were many children on board, and after the incident, many said farewell to their parents. The sound of crying was deafening and heartbreaking." Another crew member of the "Athenia," Mr. Miller, said that at 7:30 PM on the 3rd of this month (ship time), he was resting in the cabin when he heard a loud bang, knowing that disaster had struck. He immediately rushed to the deck, lowered the lifeboats, and saw a submarine moving through the waves and turning its guns, firing two shots at them. The ship was severely damaged, first tilting to the right and then sinking by the bow." (Havas, 5th)

The goals we hold are just and righteous, and I deeply believe that after shared efforts and shared sacrifices, we will achieve ultimate victory, just as we did twenty-five years ago, and crush the forces of destruction." President Lebrun immediately replied, stating, "I have received your telegram. Twenty-five years ago, when your late King George V was in power, your nation once cooperated with our country to resist the most shameful war of aggression in history. Today, our two nations are united again to defend honor and defend freedom. In the name of the French Republic, I extend my respect to your country. Our two countries share noble ideals. This decision to engage in war has sacred and righteous reasons, and I deeply believe that with the combined strength of our two countries, we will be invincible." (Havas, 4th)

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain sent a telegram to French Premier Daladier, stating, "After England and France jointly resist aggression and uphold justice, I hereby extend my respects to the people of your country on behalf of the people of our country.

I firmly believe that the sacrifices made by our two countries will not be in vain, and that ultimate victory will belong to us." Premier Daladier immediately replied, stating, "I have received your telegram, and I hereby extend my respects to your country on behalf of the French nation. It is well known that we have made many efforts for peace. Now, because Poland has been subjected to aggression, our two countries have no choice but to fight side by side to uphold justice."

I have full confidence in the loyalty and courage of all Air Force officers and soldiers and am confident that they will be able to cope with all events."

### Chamberlain Issues a Message to the German People, Listing Hitler's Crimes

London: British Prime Minister Chamberlain, speaking in German, delivered a radio address to the German people today, explaining the reasons for Britain's declaration of war on Germany. He said that England and Germany are now at war because your country has bombed and invaded Poland, a free and independent nation that we have guaranteed to protect, and has refused to withdraw its troops despite Britain's advice. We have no ill will towards the German people. We are not fighting against the German people, but against a tyrannical and untrustworthy regime that not only harms its own people but also betrays the Western civilization that you and we cherish. The Prime Minister then recounted Hitler's excuse that Poland had rejected peace proposals and the way Hitler had treated Polish Ambassador Lipski in Germany, stating, "This was not negotiation, but a command. Such methods cannot be accepted by a self-respecting and strong country. If negotiations had been conducted on a free and equal basis, this dispute could have been resolved long ago. You may ask why Britain cares so much. The reason we care is because we have guaranteed to defend Poland against aggression. You may also ask why, since Britain's interests are in the West, Britain feels the need to guarantee the defense of this Eastern country. I answer this question with regret, which is that no one in our country trusts the words of your leaders anymore. Your leaders guaranteed to respect the Locarno Pacts, but they violated them. They declared that they did not want to annex Austria, but that promise was also violated. They guaranteed not to annex Czechoslovakia, but they did. After the Munich Conference, they declared that they would no longer covet European land, but they broke their word. They have sworn for years that Bolshevism is their mortal enemy, but today they are comrades with this ideology. Can you consider their promises worth the paper they are written on? The German-Soviet non-aggression pact was a cunning move aimed at shaking the peace front, but their gamble has failed, and the peace front stands firm. Your leaders, having led themselves and you into an untenable position, are now sacrificing you in an even greater war gamble, hoping to extricate themselves from this position. May God protect justice." (Reuters, 4th)

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a radio address to the German people in German, accusing the country's leader, Hitler, of being a "gambler" making a desperate bet. He said, "This gambler was already in dire straits and did not hesitate to sacrifice the German nation, stirring up war in the hope of getting lucky. Today, England and Germany are in a state of war. German troops have not only invaded a free country, but have also used aircraft to bomb its innocent civilians. This free country has risen up to defend itself. This is the duty of every people. The British government has done everything in its power to prevent war, and this is known to all. I now wish to state clearly to you that England has now decided to wage a great war. However, we are not attacking the German nation, but the brutal and tyrannical National Socialist government. I offer this message with sincerity, and I hope you will consider it carefully." (Havas, 4th)

### Mussolini's Declaration: Italy Temporarily Remains Neutral, Military Preparations Continue Unabated, Southern Russia and Other Countries Declare Neutrality

Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini made an important speech here today, declaring that Italy would maintain neutrality for the time being. He stated that Germany informed Italy a week ago of its intention to resolve the Danzig issue by force. This notification came at a time when he was actively pursuing a peaceful solution through negotiations. In light of Germany's actions, he felt that his understanding with Germany had been violated by the German side, and the guarantees given by Italy were therefore no longer binding. Italy, in this situation, has decided to maintain its neutrality for the time being, the above remarks have been broadcast to the whole country by wireless radio. (Reuters, 5th)

Beijing - The smaller European countries are now seeking refuge in declarations of neutrality. Italy also shows no sign of participating in the war. Therefore, it appears that Germany is currently fighting against England, France, and Poland with its own strength. According to a telegram from the capital of Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria are currently in consultation to form a neutral bloc. On the other hand, the countries bordering the Persian Gulf and the Baltic countries have declared neutrality. (Associated Press, 5th)

Rome - The fact that the Roman Catholic Church has formally announced today that its ships will continue to cross the Atlantic Ocean can be seen as another indication that Italy intends to maintain neutrality in the European war, at least temporarily avoiding joining it. The Italian giant liner "Rex" will sail to New York tomorrow, and the "Conte di Savoia" is also scheduled to set sail in a few days. (Reuters, 5th)

Rome - The Italian government today ordered a ban on the export of fifty-seven kinds of goods, including aircraft, automobiles, motorcycles, ships, steel, gold, iron, aluminum, lead, zinc, copper, cotton, silk, wood, soap, oils, and other minerals. Among the food items, butter, lemons, olive oil, and sweet potatoes are included. At the same time, the government can freely requisition gasoline and lubricating oil. This action is a common preparation for war. (Associated Press, 5th)

Yugoslavia firmly believes that continuing to pursue a policy of neutrality can not only protect Yugoslavia's major interests but also promote peace between nations. At this time of tense situation, it is hoped that the people of the whole country will sincerely support the government's policy of neutrality." (Haitong Telegram, 5th)

Belgium

(Havas, 4th)

Romania

Romania is currently maintaining neutrality. Because Romania's alliance with Poland, except for possible aggression related to the Soviet Union, does not include other staff talks. This is a direct telegram from the capital of Bulgaria. Bulgaria is maintaining a strict neutral attitude. (Reuters, 5th)

Romanian Capital - The Romanian government will issue a declaration of neutrality in the near future, stating the country's attitude towards the current situation. Political figures here stated that Romania has not yet issued a declaration because it must wait for Hungary to issue such a declaration before making a decision. Public opinion throughout the country advocates that Romania should avoid being involved in the war unless it is to protect its own territory. (Haitong Telegram, 5th)

Romanian Capital - The General Staff issued an order yesterday that reservists of all levels who have received enlistment orders must report to their respective stations by September 5th. (Haitong Telegram, 5th)

### Czech Nationality: Formation of Foreign Legion to Aid Poland in Combat

Paris - Czechs and Slovaks have begun forming a foreign legion within Poland, raising hopes for the restoration of Czechoslovakia. Political figures here recently declared that although Czechoslovakia is in fact occupied by German troops, in theory, all countries that have not formally recognized the fait accompli still consider Czechoslovakia to exist. President Beneš telegraphed British Prime Minister Chamberlain the day before yesterday, stating that the Czech people also consider themselves at war with Germany. Now that Poland has allowed Slovaks and Czechs to form foreign legions while retaining their original nationalities to fight alongside the Polish army, it can be seen that Beneš's declaration of principle has been put into practice. After the formation of this foreign legion, it will be commanded by General Prchala, a senior officer of the Czechoslovak army. General Prchala recently issued a message to the soldiers, stating that Czech patriots all hold the determination to restore their homeland. Poland and Czechoslovakia are of the same race and have the same interests, both being threatened by Pan-Germanism. The policy pursued by Germany is to make the peoples of Central Europe hate each other, such as inciting Slovaks against Czechs, inciting Hungarians against Slovaks, and so on. At this moment, the crisis created by Germany has made all nations unite to resist. This is Germany's own fault. (Havas, 5th)

### Japan's Policy on the European War: Non-Intervention, Formally Notified to Representatives of Six Countries in Japan

Tokyo - Japan adopted a policy of neutrality in the European war. Today, Foreign Ministry official Sawada met with the representatives of six countries in Japan, namely Britain, the United States, France, Poland, Germany, and Italy, from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM, and notified them in person, asking them to convey to their respective governments not to create situations that would cause Japan to abandon this policy. (Reuters, 5th)

Tokyo - "Asahi Shimbun" claimed today that the correct translation of the statement issued by the Japanese government last night is "Japan will not 'intervene' in the European war, but will concentrate on resolving the China Incident." The text deliberately avoids the word "neutrality." In order to achieve its supreme goal of resolving the China Incident, Japan may encounter a situation at any time in which a third country in the European war is hostile to Japan. "Yomiuri Shimbun" reported that the Soviet ambassador to Japan had begun negotiations with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to resolve the disputes on the Manchurian border. (Reuters, 5th)

Tokyo - "The Japan Times" commented on Japan's decision to maintain neutrality in the European war, saying that Japan cannot ignore the German-Soviet military alliance. If this treaty extends its influence to East Asia, Japan will have to take positive action. If the German-Soviet alliance encourages Moscow to carry out its conspiracies to the detriment of Japan and commit aggression against Japan, the world situation will inevitably change drastically. (Reuters, 5th)

Tokyo - "Chugai Commercial News" reported that the meaning of the statement issued by the Japanese government is that Japan is prepared to cooperate with third countries or several countries that are willing to work with Japan to build a new order in East Asia. Those who want to hinder the establishment of a new order in East Asia will not hesitate to take severe action to deal with it. As long as the current European war does not exceed the scope of Europe, Japan will always adopt a policy of non-intervention. However, if the establishment of a new order in East Asia is threatened by one or several belligerent countries in Europe, Japan has a firm determination and full preparation to deal with this new situation. "Hochi Shimbun" reported that Japan will be friends with countries that sympathize with and understand Japan's position and policies, and will take severe action against those who insist on supporting the Chiang Kai-shek regime. "Kokumin Shimbun" said that all of Japan's future diplomatic actions will be based on resolving the Sino-Japanese War. The newspaper believes that Japan has the possibility of taking bold actions to end the China Incident. "Nichinichi Shimbun" also said that Japan's past painful experiences have enabled it to make correct judgments and take appropriate actions in any emergency. The newspaper urged the government not to worry about building a new order in East Asia. (Reuters, 5th)

Tokyo - As a result of the outbreak of the European war and its impact on Japan's import and export trade, the Japanese government decided to prepare a comprehensive countermeasure. In the cabinet meeting on the 5th, Aoki, who also serves as the president of the Planning Board, explained the amendment of the material plan previously drafted by the Planning Board in response to changes in the supply and demand of materials and resources due to changes in the import and export plan. Minister of Commerce Uto explained the prediction of Japan's trade situation, the unanimous views of private businesses, and the authorities' policy. Minister of Finance Aoki explained the method of suppressing speculative businesses after the outbreak of the European war, and planned to temporarily suppress them from the financial side. If it is later considered insufficient, it will also consider using strong powers to suppress it. All cabinet members unanimously approved it. With this, Japan's economic strategy to deal with the impact of the European war was established. (Domei News Agency, 5th)

### Nehru Leaves Chongqing for India

Chongqing - Nehru left Chongqing at 8:50 AM on the 5th by China National Aviation Corporation plane to return to India. Representatives from all walks of life, including Zhu Jiahua and Shao Lizi, and more than a thousand people saw him off. Zhu Jiahua delivered a farewell speech on behalf of the group, stating that Mr. Nehru's visit from afar and his bringing the sympathy and enthusiasm of the Indian people for our war of resistance and nation-building were deeply moving. Mr. Nehru urgently needed to return south due to the outbreak of the European war, and was unable to visit other cities in our country for guidance. However, he believed that during his short stay, Mr. Nehru would have a better understanding of our war of resistance, and that Sino-Indian cooperation could be further strengthened as a result. Our country apologizes for the inadequate hospitality during the war of resistance, and wishes him a safe journey and asks him to convey the Chinese people's wishes for the health of Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Tagore. Nehru replied that he had been in your country for a total of thirteen days and had been repeatedly welcomed by all walks of life in your country. This kind of warm and grand welcome far exceeded the enemy's expectations and was definitely not something the enemy would dare to try. I believe that the people of your country's welcome to me is actually a welcome to the Indian nation. Sino-Indian cooperation is inevitable. I am very honored to have had the opportunity to talk with your country's leader Chiang Kai-shek and other officials. I am especially grateful for Chiang Kai-shek's hospitality. All of this will always be engraved in my heart. Now that the war has begun, the world is changing rapidly. There are many areas where the future of China and India depends on cooperative efforts. I wish your country victory in the war of resistance and Generalissimo Chiang's health. Thank you for your kindness. After Nehru finished speaking, he boarded the plane and returned south amidst cheers. (5th Telegram)

### Roosevelt's Policy: Majority in the United States Agree, No Special Session of Congress Will Be Called Temporarily, Public Opinion Inclines to Aid Britain and France

Washington - White House Secretary Early stated to the newspapers that the United States would maintain neutrality in the European war and implement the current Neutrality Act, which would be announced by the State Department tomorrow at the same time. "The government is currently studying to what extent the United States can cooperate without having to amend the current Neutrality Act." "And before knowing the impact of the implementation of the Neutrality Act, it does not intend to convene Congress for a special session." As for President Roosevelt's broadcast speech yesterday, "As far as I know, only four people have expressed dissent." He did not reveal who they were. In short, the people of the country have given this speech good reviews, as can be seen from the telegrams and phone calls received by the White House yesterday. (Havas, 4th)

Washington - President Roosevelt and his cabinet members held an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday and decided to announce the neutrality of the United States today in accordance with international law. Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison stated that after the cabinet meeting, the government authorities intend to decide today whether to send warships to Europe to protect American ships carrying American expatriates from dangerous areas in Europe. (Associated Press, 5th)

Washington - President Roosevelt recently convened his cabinet members at the White House to discuss the situation after the outbreak of war in Europe. Afterwards, he immediately issued a public statement to the newspapers, stating that the government is scheduled to first announce neutrality tomorrow, and a few hours later, it will announce the implementation of the current Neutrality Act. Acting Secretary of the Navy Addison also issued a statement saying that for ships of the United States and other countries that carry American refugees from Europe to the United States, I will send several warships to protect them along the way. This can be decided tomorrow. (Havas, 4th)

Washington - Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison stated that the 116 destroyers currently stationed at the naval shipyards in Philadelphia and San Diego will be assigned to work at sea in order to implement the maritime regulations of the Neutrality Act. He also said that the US government authorities do not intend to send ships to escort American expatriates back to the country. In the future, the Navy will order all shipyards to work day and night in order to speed up the completion of the ship construction plan. In addition, the number of naval personnel, which was originally scheduled to increase from 110,000 to 116,000 between now and July next year, will be implemented ahead of schedule due to the current tense situation. (Associated Press, 5th)

New York - Although American newspapers across the country continue to hope that the United States will stay out of the war, the number of people advocating for the abolition of the provision in the Neutrality Act that prohibits the export of arms is gradually increasing. The Washington Evening Star stated that if the democratic countries have superior combat power, the United States has no danger of joining the war. Therefore, our best safeguard is to do everything we can to maintain the advantage of the democratic countries, except for joining the war. Other newspapers also advocate for the abolition of the ban and the adoption of a cash-and-carry method. (Reuters, 5th)

### British Naval Reserve Enlist

China's Attitude Towards the European War

Chongqing - "Sao Dang Bao" published an article today entitled "Our Attitude Towards the European War," which stated that since the Mukden Incident, the policy decided by China has been to respect treaties and resist aggression. This policy remains unchanged to this day. China's enemy is Japan. Any country that sympathizes with China can gain China's support. China expresses sympathy to any country that is fighting for freedom and independence. China also expresses its admiration for Britain and France's assistance to Poland in fulfilling its treaty obligations to resist aggression. In fact, the current time is the time for a general solution to the European and Far Eastern disputes. China firmly believes that the Soviet Union's signing of a non-aggression treaty with Germany does not mean helping Germany to commit aggression, but is purely for its own interests. China hopes that since the Soviet Union has no worries about its European rear, it will take more active measures in the Far East from now on. (Reuters, 5th)

Chongqing - Today, the newspapers here have little criticism of the European situation. "Yi Shi Bao" reported that although China sympathizes with the European countries, the affairs there have no impact on China. China will continue to be optimistic and carry out the war of resistance. (Reuters, 5th)

Chongqing - People in the Chinese government are still studying the situation after the outbreak of the European war. Officials from the Information Department are busy collecting reports for the Chinese government to decide on its policy. According to government officials who spoke to the Associated Press, the government will take concrete steps based on Chiang Kai-shek's principle of "befriending all countries and making Japan the enemy." Therefore, experienced observers believe that the Chinese government will adopt a "not suitable for neutrality" attitude, which is neutrality in fact. According to international law, the British and French gunboats currently in Chongqing should be detained. However, China's sympathy is clearly on the side of the British and French. As of now, the Chinese government has no intention of detaining British and French gunboats. According to "Sao Dang Bao," the organ of the Chinese army, China opposes any form of aggression. "Central Daily News" stated that China's attitude towards this European war is (1) to oppose aggression, (2) to uphold the sanctity of treaties, and (3) to uphold justice. In short, aggressors will be defeated. This is the inevitable historical rule. (Associated Press, 5th)

Chongqing - According to Chinese diplomatic circles who spoke to the Associated Press, due to changes in the international situation, Britain will probably not make much concessions to Japan in the future. In the past two years, Britain has sacrificed China to make concessions to Japan, such as last year's Shanghai Customs Revenue Storage and Settlement Agreement, the issue of allowing coal from Australia to be exported to Japan, and the preliminary agreement at the Tokyo Conference, all of which made concessions to the Japanese side without sacrificing China. However, the international situation finally broke out. The United States announced the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, and Germany signed a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, which relieved the Soviet Union of its worries and completely changed Japan's position. Otherwise, Britain would probably continue its policy of sacrificing China to make concessions to Japan. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Germany Issues Large Amounts of Marks

Berlin - The German News Agency announced that Germany has recently issued a large number of five-mark banknotes to meet the needs of circulation. In order to facilitate the exchange of marks, it will issue one-mark and two-mark banknotes. (Reuters, 4th)

London - Banking circles here criticized the German News Agency's announcement that Germany is now issuing large amounts of five-mark banknotes to meet the news of circulation, saying that Germany has not seen five-mark banknotes in recent years. The appearance of a large number of new banknotes, especially those with such small denominations, will cause Germans to recall the period of hyperinflation in the past and cause panic. According to the Deutsche Bank's statistics for the week ending August 31, the amount of banknotes in circulation increased sharply by 2,106,000,000 marks, while all gold and foreign exchange prepared for the issuance of banknotes decreased to 0.71 percent. (Reuters, 4th)

London - 600,000 women and children have been evacuated from London yesterday. 5,000 hospital patients have been moved to a place 50 to 60 miles from London. Nearly 20,000 people have volunteered to help with the evacuation. (Associated Press, 5th)

Shops opened by German nationals have been closed. The Hong Kong branch of the Haitong News Agency stopped sending drafts this morning. According to a telegram from Hong Kong, people under German protection, such as Czechs, are also on the banned list. (4th Telegram)

### Jianghai Customs Uses "Hua Xing" Currency, Guo Taiqi Protests to Britain, British Government Will Negotiate with Japan

London - Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi, under the order of the Chinese government, filed a strong protest with the British Foreign Office today against the new rules instigated by Japan, that is, Chinese customs duties in Shanghai must be paid based on the Hua Xing Bank banknotes. It is heard that the British government believes that this rule infringes on the integrity of Chinese customs, so it is expected that the British government will protest to the Japanese government about this matter.

Wengyuan: On the morning of the 4th, three thousand Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery from Conghua suddenly invaded northward from Taipingchang and Shengang, turning west towards Weiganshi.

### Flood Losses in Tianjin

Hong Kong: Tianjin news, the water level in the Tianjin urban area has dropped a total of three inches in the past few days, but it rose another inch last night. This is due to the tidal waters of the Haihe River, so it has no major impact. The greatest losses from the flood were in the Japanese concession and the Nan Shi, Liuli Tai, and Bali Tai areas of Special Districts 1, 2, and 3. After the British and French concessions were blockaded, all Japanese shops, factories, and warehouses were concentrated in the above areas, mostly cotton cloth, refined sand, seafood, paper, etc. The total amount of losses is at least 400 million yuan or more. The losses of Japanese military vehicles, cement, food, metals, and leather goods cannot be statistically counted. The losses suffered by flour merchants and other industries in the British and French concessions are also more than 200 million yuan. (4th)

### Yunnan Province Facing Severe Plague Epidemic, Urgent Relief Needed

Chongqing: Recently, Dr. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Chinese Executive Yuan, telegraphed the U.S. government, stating that the plague problem in Yunnan is extremely serious, so he requested assistance from the U.S. government, such as sending experts and transporting raw materials to China to engage in relief efforts, and allowing China to refer to the U.S. experience in eliminating plagues in Panama. The Chinese government also hopes that the Rockefeller Foundation can provide assistance to China. It is reported that Dr. Bauer, chairman of the foundation, recently visited Yunnan and requested the foundation to conduct a special study of this disease. There are no accurate statistics on how many people die from this disease in Yunnan each year, but the general severity can be known from surveys in various places. It is said that Simao, on the border of Annam, was once a prosperous market, with a population of 100,000 in 1925, but now it has only 20,000 people, and 80% of the deaths are due to plague. Now, nine out of ten houses in Simao are empty, and the streets are unusually deserted. Also, according to the Ningju County Chronicles, in 1303, Governor Liu Sheng (transliteration) led 2,000 soldiers to quell the rebellion, and 80% of his troops died from plague. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu years, Ningju suffered from the plague for 30 years, so that the population was completely wiped out. In 1936, the Sino-British-Burma Boundary Commission also withdrew without completing its work due to the arrival of the plague season. According to the report of the Chinese Health Department, the blood of those infected with the plague contains malaria germs, and the patients' spleens are also greatly swollen. Also, the area affected by this plague covers 42,000 square miles, and is rich in mineral and agricultural products. Among the minerals, gold and salt are very abundant. The land is suitable for growing tea, cotton, and tropical products. The Chinese government has now allocated 1,824,000 yuan to specialize in treating this disease. Treatment stations have been set up along the Yunnan-Burma Road to engage in relief efforts. The League of Nations Epidemic Prevention Committee has also donated 1,500,000 tablets of quinine. In short, the plague or malaria problem in Yunnan is indeed a serious problem. If this problem is not solved, the geographical advantages cannot be fully utilized, and even if the transportation is smooth, it will be useless. (Associated Press, 5th dispatch)

### Finance: Assisted by Tightening Foreign Exchange, Gold Price Rises Sharply; Peak Reaches $3,520; Transactions Brisk, Around 2,000 Taels

Yesterday's spot red market conditions, which had been trending downward for days, suddenly reversed and rose sharply. This rapid change and huge fluctuation made it difficult to grasp. This situation was entirely due to the instability of the market and different views on the current situation. Industry insiders had different opinions on the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact, some saying it was beneficial to China, others saying it was detrimental to China. In short, it was difficult for the average person to foresee. But in fact, Soviet Russia will never betray its friends for glory like Germany. The opening in the morning was encouraged by the tightening of foreign exchange, and there were many buyers, so it rose to the $3,200 level. Then it rose again to $3,210. Later, due to frequent selling by pawnshops and others, it once fell back to a low of $3,160. Then, a certain gold company suddenly came in and bought aggressively (reportedly on behalf of a certain Chinese bank, or on behalf of Hong Kong clients), so the price was pulled up to $3,260. At that time, sellers were still willing to supply, and it once stabilized. Around 11:00, foreign exchange was quite tight, and the buying momentum was even stronger, so it soared to a peak of $3,520. At noon, a certain roving broker sold a lot, so it fell back to $3,460. The noon close rose back to $3,500. At the initial opening in the afternoon, due to a temporary easing of foreign exchange, coupled with selling by currency exchange companies and pawnshops, the opening immediately fell back to $3,430. Then it fell again to $3,340. Later, due to a certain gold company and others coming in to absorb aggressively, and foreign exchange softening, it soared to the $3,500 level again. However, the result was a close at $3,480, a sharp increase of $410 from the previous day. Transactions were brisk, reaching around 2,000 taels. Pawnshop jewelry also rose and fell from time to time, but ultimately listed at a high of $35. British pure gold remained suspended as ordered.

### Gold Bullion Rises 410 Yuan

Since morning, each tael (ten ounces) initially opened higher because of news of a weakening exchange rate, boosting confidence. Certain gold shops and money changers mutually drove up prices. Sellers were also hesitant to sell, causing the market to open 130 yuan higher. Money changers traded 30 taels among themselves for 3,200 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop bought 10 taels from a money changer for 3,210 yuan. At that time, the silver shop "bang" suddenly initiated a selling spree, frequently dumping stock, which briefly pushed the price down to a low of 3,160 yuan. However, due to the continued weakening of the exchange rate, buyers gradually increased. A certain money changer and a certain silver shop both absorbed supply. Soon after, the price was driven up 100 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 30 taels from a money changer for 3,260 yuan. Although there were many speculators, sellers were still willing to supply because of news of a stabilizing exchange rate, causing the market to fluctuate around 3,250 yuan. Around eleven o'clock, news suddenly spread in the market that the British side would temporarily transfer certain authority to the American consul. In addition, the exchange rate was tight, and both Hong Kong "bang" and retail investors had buying intentions, causing the market to leap upwards. Although retail investors and the silver shop "bang" took profits by selling, there was still a feeling that the supply was less than demand. At 11:45, a money changer bought 40 taels of cash from a gold shop for 3,520 yuan. At that time, a certain broker in the market, on behalf of many parties, forcefully sold more than 100 taels, causing the price to immediately fall 10 yuan. A certain broker sold 10 taels to a gold shop and 30 taels to a money changer, both for 3,460 yuan. Later, a certain money changer bought 20 taels from a silver shop "bang", pushing the closing price back up to 3,500 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial opening price was 70 yuan lower because the exchange rate was stronger and money changers were willing to sell. A money changer sold 30 taels to a silver shop "bang" for 3,430 yuan. Later, the silver shop "bang" also frequently sold, causing the price to fall by 90 yuan. Money changers and silver shop "bang" sold a total of 50 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,340 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold shop resumed aggressive buying, and the exchange rate weakened again, leading to a sharp rise. Soon after, the price soared 160 yuan. Money changers traded 10 taels among themselves at a price of 3,500 yuan. Afterwards, a cash gold shop sold 10 taels to a certain gold shop, causing the price to fall back 30 yuan to 3,470 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver shop securities "bang" sold a total of 50 taels to a money changer for 3,480 yuan, which served as the closing price for the evening. As a result, the closing price was 410 yuan higher than the previous day. After closing, the securities "bang" silver shop "bang" sold a total of 30 taels to a certain silver shop for 3,485 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop sold 20 taels to a securities "bang" for 3,475 yuan. The entire day saw a fluctuation of 360 yuan. The selling price of the current brand gold of the cash gold shop was 10 yuan higher compared to bullion, and the current bid gold was 55 yuan lower than the listed gold, but there were few transactions.

### Ornamental Gold Up 35 Yuan

The exchange rate for ornamental gold per tael from silver shops, initially Da Tonghang was still listing 315 yuan. At 9:30, it was raised 5 yuan. At 10:15, it rose another 5 yuan. More than half an hour later, it was raised another 10 yuan. At 11:30, it rose another 10 yuan. At noon, it rose another 5 yuan. At 2:00 PM, it fell back 5 yuan. At 2:15, it fell back another 10 yuan. At 4:00 PM, it was raised another 15 yuan. As a result, it was raised 35 yuan. It is estimated that Da Tonghang changed to list 350 yuan, and Xin Tonghang was 348 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan.

### Cash Purchase Price Slightly Higher

The purchase price of Chinese cash from the Central Bank should be 1,311 yuan and 2 jiao. The Customs Gold listed a premium of 1 yuan and 5 jiao 8 fen. The Shanghai bid gold price listed 1,306 yuan and 5 jiao. The purchase of British pure gold remains temporarily suspended by order.

Exchange Rate Demand Turns Strong Again, Market Price Rebounds Sharply

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: the HSBC listed rate showed no change. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates suddenly rebounded sharply. The market opened weaker in the morning. After opening, due to the general sentiment among colleagues regarding the signing of the non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union, it was suddenly considered unfavorable to China, so sellers were not as eager as in the past few days. In addition, Chinese banks, Hong Kong and Shanghai Electric, and British banks with profits suddenly competed to absorb currency, causing the market to soften. Around 11:00, news again spread in the market that the British side would transfer certain authority in this port to the American consul. However, general merchants observed that in the current situation, whether or not police authority was transferred had no relation to the Chinese. Instead, it depended on whether the European war could be avoided from expanding, and neutral countries could remain unchanged from beginning to end. Therefore, they did not dare to happily sell foreign exchange. Moreover, the Western merchant Sassoon also came to aggressively absorb currency, making the market even tighter and softer. The closing price for British gold fell to 4 375/10000 of a penny, and the American exchange rate also softened to 7.375 yuan. In the early afternoon, the market briefly rebounded slightly because Chinese banks suddenly took advantage of high prices to re-emerge. However, shortly thereafter, Japanese banks such as the Yokohama Specie Bank suddenly came to aggressively absorb currency, causing the market to close at the tightest price of the day. As a result, the American exchange rate was tighter than the British exchange rate, with British tightening by 40625/1000000 and American shrinking by 9375/1000000. The trend for this month's futures was the same as the spot market. However, the result was that Chinese merchants still sold short, so the tightness was slightly weaker than the spot market. The swap rate became even more compressed. According to the evening closing price, the distance from British gold was 0.015625, and the difference between the American exchange rate was 0.03125. The combined monthly interest rate (excluding commission) was only 4.8% (calculated on a 26-day basis), so arbitrage transactions disappeared. Spot transactions were quite active throughout the day.

### Western and Hong Kong Merchants All Settle In

In the early morning, the markets for British and American currencies were as follows: British currency was temporarily suspended by order due to the war, and American currency was closed due to the Labor Day holiday, so there were no incoming telegrams.

After opening, Chinese banks first came to absorb foreign spot American exchange rate at 8.125 yuan and 0.0625. Subsequently, Ewo absorbed spot American exchange rate from colleagues at 8.0625 yuan, causing the market to soften. When the HSBC listing was announced, there was no change, and when the silver equalization tax was announced, it remained exempt. Afterwards, Hong Kong and Shanghai Electric also came to absorb currency, and foreign banks were reluctant to supply currency, causing the market to continue to soften. It is estimated that Hong Kong and Shanghai Electric absorbed foreign spot British gold at 4 5625/10000 of a penny and spot American exchange rate at 7.875 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank absorbed Chinese merchants' American exchange rate for this month at 7.875 yuan. At that time, Ewo also absorbed Chinese merchants' American exchange rate for this month at 7.8125 yuan. At that time, the market stabilized for a while. Around 11:00, news suddenly spread in the market that the British side would temporarily transfer certain authority in this port to the American consul. In addition, Chinese banks and Sassoon aggressively absorbed currency, causing the situation to become even tighter and softer. It is estimated that Chinese banks and Sassoon jointly absorbed spot American exchange rate from a certain bank ranging from 7.75 yuan to half a yuan. Subsequently, they purchased and settled HSBC and Mercantile spot British gold at 4 5625/10000 of a penny and half a penny. At that time, Chinese merchants also sold spot American exchange rate at 7.625 yuan to a certain bank. Near noon, a certain bank again absorbed Chinese merchants' spot British gold at 4 4375/10000 of a penny. Extended until the noon closing, the selling prices for spot currencies in the banks were: British gold at 4 375/10000 of a penny, and American exchange rate at 7.375 yuan, which were 3125/1000000 tighter and 8125/1000000 softer than the morning opening prices, respectively.

The prices for British and American currencies for this month shrank by 359375/1000000 and increased by 84375/1000000, respectively. The trading records for the day are listed below.

### "Joint Notes" Unofficial Market Rises Daily

The Tianjin exchange market still has no telegrams arriving in Shanghai. According to private sources, the unofficial market for "joint notes" is rising daily. 100 yuan of legal tender is only worth 70 yuan of "joint notes."

### Foreign Currencies Rebound Sharply, British and American Gold Sovereigns Rise 11 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currencies saw a sharp rebound and softening trend due to sudden changes in the foreign exchange market. Bullion prices rebounded sharply. British and American gold sovereigns rebounded significantly. British gold sovereigns rose by as much as 83 yuan, and American gold sovereigns rose by as much as 86 yuan. The demand for British and American gold notes was very strong, and the market was firm and bullish. British gold notes rose by as much as 51 yuan and 5 jiao, and American gold notes rose by as much as 13 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen. The Hong Kong notes market was firm and strong, with a market price of 3 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen. Canadian notes followed suit, becoming expensive at 12 yuan. Australian gold notes also rose to 38 yuan. The trend for Japanese gold notes was slightly firm at 1 yuan, 1 jiao and 9 fen. The demand for Korean notes was sluggish, with a market price of 1 yuan, 0 jiao, 5 fen and 5 li. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold sovereigns rise by 11 yuan, British gold notes rise by 7 yuan and 5 jiao, American gold notes rise by 1 yuan, 6 jiao and 5 fen, Hong Kong notes rise by 4 jiao and 5 fen, Canadian notes rise by 1 yuan and 2 jiao, and no market for other currencies.

### Discount Rate Rebounds 10 Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for bank drafts fluctuated upwards, hovering around 130 yuan per 1,000 yuan. It once continued to fall to 120 yuan, but near noon, it slightly rebounded to 125 yuan. In the afternoon, those seeking cash drafts became more active, suddenly seeing a rush of 20 yuan, reaching as high as 145 yuan. Finally, it slightly fell back to 140 yuan, rebounding 10 yuan. The interest rates for interbank lending by the Money Trades Association remained listed at 2 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities: Many Changes in the Current Situation, Domestic Debt Difficult to Revitalize for the Time Being

Yesterday's securities unofficial market was already loose and soft. The large bulls felt satisfied, and some had already emerged. The market felt that the expansion of the European war meant many changes in the future. Therefore, although the main bull line had not yet moved, the floating bulls felt uncertain and slowly sold out. It was unusually difficult to boost morale for the time being. The European war had already become a prairie fire, and the longer it lasted, the wider it would spread. How would the government respond, and what would be the attitude of Japan and the Soviet Union? There were thousands of strands and it was extremely complicated. Speculators were also lost in a fog, their minds confused and at a loss as to what to do. Therefore, market prices fluctuated greatly. Yesterday's transactions, except for the 20th, which saw some buying, the demand for Runli Datong, etc., was extremely limited. Retail investors sold more than they bought. Sellers such as the 5th, 8th, 16th, 38th, as well as Hongkang and Shunheng successively sold, and the market price initially firmed but later weakened, with the trend already showing signs of being unable to pick up. As a result, the market price of Type E was supported by the 20th, which was the only one that rose by 3 jiao, while the rest all fell by 1 or 2 jiao. Type D again failed to open. The total number of transactions was estimated to be 700,000 or 800,000 yuan. A brief and clear table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 50 shares of the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 37 yuan.

Also, the Shanghai Public Industry Association reported that yesterday's stock market of the Public Industry Association saw very few transactions, but the scope of transactions was wider, and the trend was no different from before, only slightly more optimistic. There was reasonable demand for tram shares at a price of 36 yuan. Jardine Spinning Mill shares rose from 16 yuan and 2 jiao to 8 jiao at closing, with still many buyers. Rubber shares were still ignored and difficult to revitalize for the time being.

The London Stock Exchange has already reopened, and market prices have fallen uniformly, reaching new levels. However, stocks of British merchants in the Far East, as well as Chinese foreign debts, have not been received.

### Yarn and Cotton: European War Expands, New Yarn Buying Resurges, Double Horse and Earth Each Rise 17 or 18 Yuan

The yarn market continued to advance, and the rising trend resurged. Due to the expansion of the European war, generally nervous people worried that the Eurasian shipping lines would be halted, and that hardware materials and raw cotton needed by the yarn factories could not come to Shanghai, which would affect the work of the yarn factories and increase costs. Therefore, colleagues were clearly seen to be enthusiastically making new purchases. However, according to the passenger "bang", although there are currently purchases in Hong Kong, there is a lack of ships and no way to load them. In addition, remittances to the interior are very difficult, and future handling of goods will inevitably stagnate. Judging by this situation, the prosperity of passenger sales transactions is hopeless, and the yarn market has been hindered again. Yesterday, the Hong Kong "bang" only bought 30 bales.

The human atmosphere was enthusiastic at the opening of the spot yarn market, saying that the unofficial market for Indian cotton had risen sharply, and there were still many buyers in the market. The opening price rose by 10 yuan, and the spot price for Double Horse was 600 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 574 yuan. Then, due to the passenger "bang" business still being sluggish and lackluster, it saw a fall again. By closing, it was heard that the exchange rate had changed and shrunk, and the buying trend had strengthened, and it rose again. It was found that the statistics for the half-day transaction was 950 bales, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 17 yuan, and the price of Double Earth rose by 18 yuan.

In other news, Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions were tighter yesterday, and the foreign cotton market soared. As a result, Shanghai's transactions suddenly became active. Japanese factories ordered foreign cotton from foreign firms, and it was difficult to secure cargo space. Moreover, war risk was extraordinarily high, and the cost of adding forward drafts was approximately 20 yuan per picul. Since there are not many ships at sea, raw cotton may not arrive on time in the future, which will greatly affect production. Therefore, as of yesterday,

### Foreign Telegrams Soar, Japanese Factories Begin Ordering Foreign Cotton

Today's spot cotton transactions have entered a standstill, actually due to the rebound in the yarn market and the expansion of the European war, and the fear that the Far East transportation lines may be interrupted. Generally, those holding goods are also unwilling to sell at low prices. Secondly, the unofficial telegrams of Indian cotton show that the price of white Lowe cotton for the April and May period has soared by more than 20 rupees compared to the end of the week, resulting in an exchange increase of 7 or 8 yuan. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to get close to the prices negotiated by both parties. As for the factory owners, in view of the fact that domestic new cotton is being launched on the market, they are more determined, and the major factories also have a sufficient supply of raw materials for fine yarns. Thus, the two sides have a stalemate. As for sources from northern Jiangsu, it is estimated that 580 bales of Tongzhou cotton have arrived. The opening prices of new Tong cotton are listed on the left.

Starting to search for spot goods among colleagues, Kangbo and Huisteng, which can be spun into 24 counts, are sold at 150 yuan. It is expected that cotton prices will rise sharply.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was closed yesterday for the US Labor Day holiday. Yesterday, the Indian cotton market also soared by 17 rupees due to the European war, and Egyptian cotton also soared by more than 150 pounds. Liverpool rose by 70 or 80 points.

### Food: Japonica and Indica Rice Plunge, Yu Qiaqing Handles Foreign Rice, First Batch to Arrive in Shanghai in About 8 Days

Various sources of Du rice: None from Hexia. The wheel buns came with more than 6,000 bags each of new jian from Jiangbei Wuhu and other places. The morning market opened with a lingering impact, and the inward flow continued to be good. All goods were uniformly shouting 2 or 3 yuan higher. Ruo Gao Xizeng was as high as 39 yuan, Jiangbei Xin Jian 34 yuan, Hexia early and late rice 34 yuan. However, the shops in this street suddenly tended to be sluggish, and the situation showed signs of heading downstream. As a result, regardless of japonica jian, all fell by 1 or 2 yuan. The closing price of Gao Xi japonica was 36 yuan to 35 yuan, Su Tongkun japonica was 35 yuan, Hexia early and late rice was 32 yuan, the original package was 35 yuan to 34 yuan, Jiaxing Jiashan Xin Chuan Jian was 30 yuan, Yangquan Jian was 30 yuan, Jiangbei Xin Jian was 31 yuan to 30 yuan, Wuhu Chen Jian was 32 yuan, Xin Jian was 31 yuan to 30 yuan, Bian Yuan was 30 yuan. Statistics show that the city's total transaction volume was nearly 5,000 bags.

In the morning market, the passenger indica was being inquired about by insiders and outside hoarders, and the market price increased by 2 yuan again. Soon after, Xin Xian from Jiangbei, Xin Chen Xian from Jingwu, and Xin Jian from Jiangzhe arrived in Shanghai one after another. Another 3,000 or 4,000 bags of Jiangbei Xian arrived, and it was rumored that only 2,000 bags of foreign rice were returned by the French ship, and most of the foreign rice would be shipped to Shanghai on neutral ships and could arrive within the week. Therefore, morale was down, and the price dropped by 2 or 3 yuan. In the afternoon market, the shop hoarding was sluggish, and passenger traders sold off, and then dropped by 2 or 3 yuan. As a result, it was 3 or 4 yuan lower than the previous day. Gao Ke Xian was only 30 yuan, Zhongguan goods were 27 yuan, and the market was still soft. However, the morale is currently uncertain, and the market price fluctuates greatly. The rise and fall of the future market will depend entirely on the smooth arrival of sources and our ability to transfer them.

The French postal ship Qinlabao, which loaded 12,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon the other day, was ordered to return to Saigon due to the international situation, and the foreign rice did not come. Yesterday, another Yangzi ship of the company, which also loaded 200 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, entered port yesterday afternoon around 3:00 pm and docked at Pudong Qichang Warehouse for unloading. It was also heard that the first batch of more than 18,300 bags of foreign rice handled by Chu Qiaqing will arrive in Shanghai in about 8 days.

### Current Flour Factory Prices Increase by 2 Jiao, Wheat Market Also Firm and Unusually Buoyant

Flour: Yesterday, the flour market increased by 2 jiao. The price of the 2nd flour factory increased to 6 yuan and 4 jiao in cash. This is because of the outbreak of the war between Germany and Poland, the soaring of foreign wheat, and the soaring of domestic wheat. The factories believe that costs are increasing daily and cannot avoid raising prices. At the same time, due to the increase in factory prices, hoarders are more greedy, and the selling price has increased from 6 yuan and 5 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao. However, the situation slightly softened in the afternoon, because the price of rice fell back and the actual sales of domestic sales in this street gradually decreased, and morale turned to stability. The city's total turnover was about 40,000 bags, with actual sales and warehouse receipts each accounting for half.

Wheat: Yesterday's market was firm and buoyant. Sources from Jingzhen, Suxi, and other places were still fairly smooth. However, some production areas have been controlled by a certain party, so the holders of goods are very determined, and the hoarders' buying demand is also strong. Therefore, the market rose by 2 jiao again. It is estimated that the hoarders handled more than 20 cars of wheat from the Suzhou and other wheat shops, with the highest price being 10 yuan and 8 fen. Fufu and other two factories entered more than 10,000 bags of wheat from Su, Xi, Jing, Zhen, Danyang, and other places, with the price being 9 yuan and 4 jiao to 9 yuan, which was 4 jiao higher than the previous price.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Prices Increase More Vigorously

Yesterday, due to the obstruction of sources from the European war, there were quite a few people inside and outside the industry who purchased and hoarded foreign sugar, and the increasing momentum became more vigorous. The association divided the current spot price of 24 crude white sugar by another yuan, with 47 yuan to 47 yuan and 3 jiao at this warehouse, 46 yuan and 5 jiao to 47 yuan at the foreign warehouse, and the transshipment cargo increased by yuan and a half, with an initial division of 36 yuan, and then 36 yuan and a half. The Taikoo Car White felt more tense, rising by another two yuan. The eastern warehouse B mark was 50 yuan and a half to 51 yuan and 8 jiao, the western warehouse was 50 yuan and 7 jiao to 52 yuan, the CW mark was 51 yuan and 7 jiao, the CX mark was 51 yuan and 4 jiao, the DY mark was 51 yuan, the HX mark was 50 yuan and 8 jiao, and the H mark of the army was 34 yuan and a half to 35 yuan. The current spot price of Dutch red was 42 yuan to 42 yuan and a half, up 5 jiao, and the transshipment was 36 yuan, up a yuan. This cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 47 yuan, this No. 1 ice was 53 yuan and a half, and Jingming ice was 55 yuan, all up a yuan. The domestically produced Diao Qinghao Square was 4 or 5 yuan apart from the negotiator's bidding price and the line price, and the Huizhou white shouted up to 57 yuan, all without a deal, because the price level was too high, and the buyers did not dare to be greedy.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Linhuai Zai Rises Another Two Yuan

Black melon seeds have been rare recently, and the market situation is still tight. Although the going is not prosperous, the opening price is still on the rise. The Linhuai Guanzi goods that opened at 32 yuan before, now open at 33 or 34 yuan. If the sales volume increases, the future market is still looking for continued rise.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rising Trend Resurrects

The soybean oil rising trend resurfaced yesterday. Dalian barrel oil went from 50 yuan and 7 jiao, and gradually increased to 53 yuan and 2 jiao, with 80 barrels traded. More than 400 barrels of Kobe Raine oil were opened, and the price frequently rose from 52 yuan and 8 jiao to 54 yuan and 8 jiao. A total of 250 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, (for details, see the market price column), and 200 pieces of Yanqi oil, 300 pieces of Qingqi oil, 2,000 cans of Tianjin canned oil, 50 cans of Baiwen canned oil, and peanut oil were sold by two fewer sellers, and the market price tracked the rise of soybean oil, and a total of 30 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were opened, with the price being 68 yuan to 71 yuan and 5 jiao. Also, 40 pieces of Jiaozhou transshipment oil were priced at 54 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Trading Slightly Lively, East Piece Returns to Good

Domestic Cloth

In recent days, the cloth market has been experiencing scarce Huainan ships, leading to sluggish sales downstream. However, factory defenses have been triggered by the outbreak of war, causing raw materials and dyeing costs to increase sharply, and there is a trend for cloth prices to rise again. Market prices are far lower than costs, and the fact that the discount rate is declining, coupled with the development of autumn sales in this street and the interior, has attracted the attention of new hoarders, so colleagues' buying and selling have become slightly more active. Wholesale transactions included 150 packages of Fugui and Earth fine twill, and there were also more than 200 boxes of blue cloth, Shilin cloth, Zhigong and Biji. The wholesale Doushihao in this street handled 250 or 260 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, lining cloth, and printed goods. The Guangdong and Nanyang "bang" made fewer purchases, and the Hong Kong "bang" resold various goods originally purchased. The market price for all cloth has become firm. White goods are average, and the selling price for blue cloth, Shilin and other non-fading cloths, fine yarn and thread, and other goods has risen by 1 jiao to 3 or 5 jiao per bolt.

East Piece

The market trend remains firm. This street and the Qinhuangdao and Yantai "bang" continue to demand and store goods, and more than 800 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill have been traded. The selling price for fine twill is average, and the price for fine cloth continues to rise by 1 jiao to 3 jiao per bolt. Fine Biji and Zhigong have risen sharply by 1.5 to 2 points per yard. Four Gentlemen Biji is sold for 5 jiao and 4.5 points. This street handled more than 100 boxes of various patterned goods, and 25 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong on the 6th. Due to the impact of the European war on the coal market, foreign coal will be out of stock, and cargo owners are defending against famine, hoarding and speculating, and are unwilling to sell, resulting in a market with transactions but no volume, and confusion. Until now, there have been no transactions. Yesterday, the Australian Sales Office has temporarily suspended business, and the market atmosphere is even more tense. Kaiping special block and colleagues dismantle prices. The unofficial market price has shouted 76 yuan per ton, 1st grade residue 54 yuan, 2nd grade residue 48 yuan. Foreign warehouses deliver goods, and handling is at the customer's own expense.

### The Sorrow of a Man Losing Love

Many of life's joys arise from the love between men and women. Undoubtedly, a man who is rejected by his lover will be depressed and despondent. Sometimes, he will be at a loss, like a homeless dog. Although there are also crude men who turn love into hatred and resort to cruel revenge, this is not a wise approach. You should know that even if you kill your wife, you will suffer in prison! Therefore, wise men, you should ask yourselves why you were rejected by a woman.

A woman's love for a man is like a man's love for a woman—it is a natural instinct. A strong and handsome young man who discovers a charming, beautiful, and passionate woman will inevitably be drawn to her, perhaps even falling in love at first sight. It is common for love to develop quickly and lead to marriage. As for their married life, it will naturally be harmonious and joyful, creating a happy family and raising clever children. How wonderful is that! However, if a man commits self-abuse and nocturnal emissions in his youth, or indulges in excessive sexual activity after marriage, depleting the seminal essence of his reproductive glands, he will suffer from nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, premature aging, and neurasthenia. As a result, his energy will be scattered, and his face will be pale and thin. His unmarried lover will be dissatisfied, and there is a risk of losing her! A married wife, repeatedly unsatisfied in her sexual life, or even completely useless, cannot help but feel resentment, leading to various tragedies in the family! The field of love is like a battlefield, and the defeated can only look up at the triumphant showing off, while they themselves are in a position of humiliation, ridicule, and trampling, with no way to change things!

A slave is shameful, and is it not even more shameful for a dignified husband to be humiliated by a woman! If kidney deficiency and physical weakness are unavoidable, in today's era of advanced medicine, there are effective treatments. If one can follow the symptomatic treatments recognized by famous Chinese and Western doctors and actively take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su," one can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves in one day and night. Continued use will cure various symptoms in a short period, transforming a sick man into a strong man. Then, in the field of love, one can turn defeat into victory and look down on their shy lover like a lotus flower after rain. Thus, love is harmonized, and one can obtain infinite happiness in life! However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" to stop the leakage, so that the effect will be rapid!

Patient Sheng Zhizhong, a local resident, 30 years old, suffered from severe brain weakness and kidney deficiency after several years of marriage. He had slight nocturnal emissions, and in his sexual life with his wife, he was often fleeting or completely impotent. Therefore, the couple was like ice and charcoal, often quarreling. He lacked energy for work and was in danger of losing his job! Therefore, he was overwhelmed with worry and sought my diagnosis and treatment. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Sheng Zhi Su" half a dozen and "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" two boxes from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, and take both together. Within three days, the nocturnal emissions stopped, and in less than a month, all his illnesses were miraculously cured. His complexion was rosy, and his energy was abundant. Therefore, the couple was like newlyweds again.

Beauty and Health

### Effective Remedies for Poor Breast Development

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Voluptuous breasts and full hips captivate all,
A gaze full of longing steals the soul away,
Who can be so lucky to enjoy such a sight?
The spirit yearns to enter her fragrant chamber!

Facts speak louder than words, no matter how virtuous and moralistic, self-controlled, or troubled one may be. But when you see a healthy and beautiful woman with towering breasts, full hips, beautiful face, and a curvy figure, approach you for a conversation, or come into contact with you due to some connection, even if you are in a bad mood and uninterested, at this moment, you will smile broadly as if "spring returns to the millet valley", completely forgetting your depression. As for those who are in a good environment and naturally love beauty, once they have such a romantic encounter, they will simply be humble and subservient, trying to please her, fearing that the beauty will not be satisfied! Therefore, beautiful women have all the advantages and enjoy endless happiness in today's society, where aesthetic values have changed dramatically and social interactions are becoming more open. This is so glorious and gratifying! However, if one has committed self-abuse, breast binding, vaginal discharge, congenital weakness, irregular menstruation, malnutrition, anemia, hemoptysis, multiple births, serious illnesses, which damage the function of the reproductive glands and ovaries, affecting metabolism, then the breasts will not develop well, or even if they do, they will gradually wither and flatten, becoming like a man's chest. How can such women avoid being disliked by men and abandoned by society?! The only remedy: according to the experience of French beauty experts and gynecologists such as Dr. William Ginigi and others, it is generally recognized that taking the reproductive gland and ovary endocrine preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" for women is the most effective and symptomatic treatment. This preparation was invented by the former Austrian physiology master Dr. Staner after 30 years of arduous experimentation, so its efficacy is very accurate. The medicinal power can penetrate all parts of the body in one day and night after taking it. After taking it for seven days, you will feel an increase in appetite and a clear mind. After taking it for four weeks, you will feel a slight itching sensation in the breasts, and they will become uplifted. If you continue to take it for a season, even the most withered breasts can become towering, the hips full, and the cheeks rosy and delicate.

### Nocturnal Emission is Not an Incurable Disease

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Although nocturnal emission is not painful or itchy, the consequences of neglecting treatment are unimaginable! Therefore, an intelligent young man, upon discovering nocturnal emission, will seek effective treatment to cure it as soon as possible. However, the quality of medicines and doctors on the market varies, or because of one's eagerness to see results, the root cause may not be treated. As a result, the symptoms show no improvement, or even worsen. Therefore, some people doubt that nocturnal emission is an incurable disease, which is truly a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. As for confused young men who commit self-abuse and indulge in lust in the past, and then suffer from nocturnal emission and neglect treatment, resulting in depleted essence and blood, and the emergence of hundreds of diseases, that is even more foolish and pitiful!

This is a common fact. A young man who should be healthy, after suffering from nocturnal emission for years, may progress from nocturnal emission to spermatorrhea and sperm leakage. The essence may become thin and depleted, affecting the brain, spinal cord, and three major nerves, leading to brain decay, insomnia, poor memory, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, and scattered energy. Due to the obstruction of developmental function and the decline of metabolism, there are countless cases of incomplete development and premature aging. Such weak men are trapped in pain all day long. Students will not be able to continue their studies and pursue further education. Those engaged in industry and commerce will feel unable to cope and risk losing their jobs. At the same time, they also lose their masculine spirit. Unmarried men risk losing their lovers, and married men cannot have a happy married life, causing their wives to hate them. Tragedies such as elopement, divorce, and suicide often occur in families as a result!

The right medicine is like opening a lock. If there is an effective medicine for nocturnal emission, there is no reason why it cannot be cured. Those who suffer from it can actively take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" to consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, and have the special effects of promoting sleep and stopping nocturnal emission. If there are the above-mentioned symptoms due to nocturnal emission or lust, it is necessary to also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su," which can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves within 24 hours after taking it. Continued use can also promote development and adjust metabolism, which can cure various symptoms in a short period of time. Regular use can also have the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating, and returning to youth. Patients who can come to our clinic for electrotherapy and injections will receive even faster results!

### Staying Calm in the Face of Terrible Pain

A person under the torment of pain often becomes helpless, so it is best to remain calm in this situation. Patients with acute gonorrhea experience terrible pain in the early stages, and when faced with severe terror, they often lose their rationality in dealing with the disease. Because in acute gonorrhea, the urethra is itchy, followed by burning and stinging pain, frequent urination, difficulty urinating, and pus and blood flowing out, staining the clothes and bedding, and the body develops a high fever. This pain is most unbearable, and at the same time, they are also severely affected mentally because of social condemnation, family ridicule, and spousal scolding. Under this double pressure, they often look depressed and feel like they are on the verge of death.

However, when this pain reaches its peak, it is still a good opportunity for easy treatment, but it is necessary to abandon the abuse of forced injections and medications, hoping to achieve temporary results with expedient methods. Local surgery, improper medications, and crude pigment injections should all be abandoned. It is necessary to prioritize sterilization, anti-inflammation, and diuresis. Based on my practical experience of more than ten years, the treatment for acute gonorrhea involves taking the latest chemotherapy internally, injecting autologous vaccines, and using German "Filter Lymphatic Level Flow Electropathy". It can definitely stop the pain on the same day, and promote diuresis and reduce inflammation on the same day. Mild cases can be completely cured within three days, and severe cases can be completely eradicated within a week, with absolutely no residual gonorrhea toxin, so there will be no recurrence. After recovery, the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department can test and prove that it has been eradicated. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM

### French Reservists Formed into Squadrons This Morning, British Nationals Volunteered for Service, Germans Showed Calm and Did Not Leave Temporarily, British Ships Ordered to Resume Sailing, Mail Ships Leave Shanghai, British Official Orders to Sever Trade Relations with Germany

The European war situation has already entered an intense stage of warfare after the declaration of war. In Shanghai, Chinese and foreign individuals, in addition to listening quietly to wireless reports of the war situation, nationals of various European countries related to the war in Shanghai are ready to serve their motherland. On the British side, orders have been received from the government to prohibit commercial exchanges with the enemy (Germany). Municipal Council employees and qualified reservists have been registering, but have not yet received orders for deployment. British nationals are waiting eagerly for further orders from the government with enthusiasm. French qualified reservists have packed their bags, preparing to dedicate themselves to the battlefield. Polish nationals, feeling threatened by the god of war, have expressed their determination to defend their homeland and fight for their free survival. It is expected that within a certain period, the recruitment of active-duty nationals of various countries will be frequent. German nationals have not yet received any news of departure due to transportation issues. However, German merchants have been significantly affected by the war. On the shipping front, British ships have been ordered to resume sailing. The details are as follows:

### British Nationals Eager to Serve, French Soldiers to be Sent to Vietnam

British Nationals in Shanghai Eager to Serve

Regarding the movements of British nationals in Shanghai, according to reliable sources, the British Consulate General in Shanghai notified British nationals on the morning of the 4th that they should remain in their original positions and await orders. Once orders are issued, the British Consul General will notify them again. British nationals in Shanghai felt excited after hearing the British King's address and eagerly wanted to return to their homeland to serve. They have been requesting the British Consul General to register. British reservists in Shanghai have been distinguishing their ranks and badges. They demand, at the very least, to join the army and participate in the war immediately. It is also reported that it has not yet been decided whether British personnel of the Shanghai Municipal Council will participate in the war. However, the majority of Municipal Council employees have voluntarily prepared lists and registered with the British Consulate General in Shanghai as reservists or volunteers. As for more than 20 British employees of the "Z" level of the Municipal Police Department, they have formed a regiment of reservists, awaiting orders.

The North-China Daily News reported that an official from the British Consulate General declared yesterday morning (the 4th) that British nationals in Shanghai would receive instructions published in newspapers and issued by the British Consul General at any time. They are to remain in their current positions and await official instructions, to best serve the interests of the country. The British Consulate General's office was extremely active yesterday due to hundreds of British nationals flocking to submit their completed volunteer service forms. British nationals in Shanghai have all completed volunteer service forms and will serve the government if necessary. It is hoped that the few who have not yet submitted their service forms will complete them within the next few days. British reservists in Shanghai have not yet been called to join the military. Unless absolutely necessary, British army reservists here may not be called up, but some naval reservists may be called up.

Qualified French Soldiers to Depart Soon

A portion of the French reservists withdrew their registration forms from the French Consulate in Shanghai on the 3rd. It is said that these reservists could not pass the medical examination. However, those who have already registered and are qualified reservists are scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to their country to participate in the war within days, although the departure date has not been determined. According to the consulate, these reservists do not intend to return directly to their country but will first be sent to Annam to await orders.

The North-China Daily News reported that a large number of French reservists who registered with the French Consulate General in Shanghai on Sunday have reported to the French Concession barracks yesterday (the 4th) for physical examinations and will then be assigned to military duties. Although no news could be obtained from official sources yesterday regarding this matter, it was learned from reliable sources that the first batch of French reservists will leave Shanghai soon. The number of people could not be determined, but it is believed that it has not yet been decided. These departing individuals will not return to France for the time being, and their temporary destination is Vietnam.

French Reservists Formed into Squadrons This Morning

The Shanghai French nationals' reserve team, 300 strong, which is armed and ready to depart, is scheduled to hold a squadron formation ceremony at 7:00 AM today (the 6th) at the French army barracks on Fuli Road, inspected by Colonel Grignia, commander of the French army stationed in Shanghai. At that time, Colonel Grignia will deliver a speech announcing the meaning of mobilization.

French Ambassador to Console Nationals This Afternoon

French Ambassador to China, Mr. Gosmar, in order to declare the will of his country's government in this European war and the attitude that Shanghai French nationals should take, has specifically invited prominent Shanghai French nationals to a banquet at his private residence at 727 Hague Road this afternoon (the 6th). There will be a solemn expression during the banquet, with the expectation that Shanghai French nationals will gain a clearer understanding of the current European situation. It is expected that this grand banquet will further increase the enthusiasm of French nationals.

Polish Consul Expresses Fight for Freedom

According to the Polish Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Bohomol, his motherland's resistance to Germany is purely a fight for freedom, independence, and survival. Polish Minister to China, Mr. Weidantao, accompanied by his wife and daughter, returned to his country on the Changxing Company's Japanese Empress ship to assume diplomatic duties. However, the ship had not been approved by the British naval commander in Shanghai, so as of last night, it had not yet left Shanghai. According to Minister Wei, he planned to go directly to Vancouver, Canada, and return to his country via that route.

### Germans Seek Calm and Express Goodwill Towards China

German Nationals Maintain Normal Life

The North-China Daily News reported that German nationals in Shanghai made every effort yesterday (the 4th) to maintain normal commercial and social life. German official and commercial organizations maintained their usual hours and work. From appearances, they do not intend to make any changes. It has been firmly denied that larger German commercial firms intend to register under the name of a neutral country. Personnel from the German Consulate General engaged in consulate affairs and answered countless questions from German nationals in Shanghai all day long, and notified German nationals that there was no apparent reason for them to feel anxious or to move out of the Public Concession or the French Concession.

German Daily Encourages Nationals

Although the German Consulate General did not issue a formal statement, the German Daily in Shanghai published an editorial on the front page, urging German nationals to maintain a calm and dignified attitude, and to abide by discipline. The newspaper firmly stated that it is the duty of all citizens of this international city to reduce the burden on the shoulders of the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors. The newspaper published a special four-page edition containing news of the declaration of war and announcements. The incident of British soldiers attacking the German Tennis Association at the racecourse on Sunday has been investigated by the British military authorities. It is reported that at least two British soldiers have been arrested on the spot by the British military police.

1,500 Germans in Shanghai

The Continental Daily News reported that, according to the German Consulate General in Shanghai, there are currently 1,500 Germans residing in Shanghai, mostly in the French Concession. There are approximately 40 German commercial firms in the city. According to important German merchants, they are currently proceeding with work as usual, but they are concerned about the lack of transportation convenience, as German ships have been ordered not to sail to Shanghai.

Sino-German Friendship Improving

They do not intend to leave Shanghai to facilitate the purchase of raw materials such as tin and tungsten, which China produces in abundance. Major German merchants criticized the attitude of the Chinese towards the Nazi government, saying that Sino-German relations have improved since the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. A German national claimed, "We have regained a portion of the friendship and goodwill of the Chinese people."

German Leader Resumes Activities

Mr. Glade, Chairman of the German Association in Shanghai, whose departure from Shanghai on the British liner "Da Mei" was undecided, has recently returned here, representing German nationals and resuming his activities. Mr. Glade published a notice in the Shanghai German Daily this morning (the 5th), stating that every German national, in this critical period, must fully understand the necessity of maintaining dignity and discipline, and that the obligation to maintain peace and quiet should not be hindered by provocations and planned news.

Goods Moved Out of British Warehouses

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that several large German commercial firms in Shanghai were busy this morning (the 5th) moving their goods out of warehouses owned by British nationals and transferring them to warehouses operated by third-country nationals, mostly American and Chinese merchants. However, apart from this, most German commercial firms in the Public Concession remain open for business today. The Deutsch-Asiatische Bank on the corner of Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road was crowded with people all morning, mostly depositors, except for a few foreign merchants.

German Nationals Can Reside Freely

It is reported that the Public Concession authorities intend to allow German nationals to reside freely. According to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director, this decision is different from that of 1914. At that time, Britain and France took severe actions against Germany. In this war, although Britain and France have declared war on Germany, it was out of necessity, and all measures to deal with the situation are tending towards peace. Therefore, if German nationals in Shanghai do not engage in any improper behavior, the Concession authorities will naturally allow them to live and work in peace within the Concession.

Italian Nationals Complete Registration

Since the European war situation has become increasingly acute, although Italy has expressed its intention not to participate in the war for the time being, the actions of Italy in the future are still being closely watched. The fact that the Italian mail ship "Ru Lian Gai Sa" has remained at the Degu Pier in Shanghai is noteworthy. Yesterday, according to a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency, the Italian Embassy in Shanghai had completed the registration procedures for Italian nationals, as instructed by the Italian Ambassador. There are more than 1,000 Italian nationals residing in Shanghai, more than 1,000 in Tianjin, and approximately the same number in Hong Kong (including merchants and priests). Italian Ambassador Mr. Tiliangmin went to Beidaihe for summer vacation early on and will return to Shanghai in February. Consul General Mr. Celoni is also on vacation in Dalian and will return to Shanghai on the 12th or 13th of this month. The Vice Consul in charge of Italian nationals and senior officials of the embassies and consulates have all gone to Japan for summer vacation and will also return to Shanghai on the 10th of this month. The only Italian warship in Shanghai is the "Ka Luotuo", with only about 200 soldiers. The other ship, named "Ge Luoni", has sailed to Qinhuangdao. It is unknown whether it will come to Shanghai. Recently, the embassies and consulates have not only taken no action, but their telegrams are also very few.

### British Official Issues Notice, Severing Trade with Germany

The North-China Daily News reported that the British Embassy in China issued a notice yesterday afternoon, warning British people that from the outbreak of the war, it is illegal to have commercial or other connections with the enemy without official permission. Such permission will not be granted except in special circumstances, and violators will be severely punished.

The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that an official from the British Embassy told reporters today (the 4th) that, regarding the new regulations prohibiting British people from trading with the enemy, German, Austrian, and Jewish refugees in Shanghai are also considered "enemies". However, the regulations promulgated yesterday (the 4th) are preliminary warnings, and there are provisions that trading with certain "enemy" people may be considered "innocent".

The notice contains six items:

(1) Traders and shipowners must not trade with the enemy without official permission after the outbreak of the war. Violators will be severely punished. (2) For the purposes of this notice, the following circumstances are considered hostile acts: A. Trading by governments or merchants in enemy territory; B. Any person and host in enemy territory; C. Various branches of trade located in enemy territory; D. Companies and corporations controlled by enemy laws; E. Those who serve and reside in the enemy country and trade in the enemy territory. (3) Warnings to merchants and individuals: A. All lending and remittance transactions with enemy countries are prohibited; B. It is also prohibited to engage in trade that would allow the enemy to gain credit or cash, or trade that would allow the enemy to escape cash obligations; C. All debts due to neutral countries from enemy countries are refused, except for trade obligations that were incurred before the outbreak of the war; E. Absolutely prohibited from supplying goods beneficial to the enemy, and from extracting goods imported from the enemy country. (4) Matters for merchants trading after the war: The occurrence of debts related to trade with enemy merchants before the war, and this trade is a large part of a commercial firm in a certain country, and the main trade affairs are related to exchange business in neutral territory and debt relations with the enemy country, and the debts are paid under the name of individuals, unless permitted by the British Ambassador. (5) Payments for life insurance trademarks and designs require a permit. (6) All those who trade with hostile people must consult the British Embassy.

### British Commercial Banks Suspend Payment of Deposits and Drafts to Germans

After the British Consul General in Shanghai notified British merchants not to engage in commercial relations with enemy countries (Germany), it is reported that British banks such as HSBC, Macquarie, Great Britain, Advantage, and Sassoon have suspended the settlement of all transactions with German merchants, including deposits and drafts, from today. It is also reported that the deposits of German merchants in British banks are not large, as most of the funds of German firms and individuals are deposited in the German Deutsch-Asiatische Bank. It is also reported that German firms such as De Fu, Qian Xin, Bayer, Meister, and Mi Ye have refused to accept the notes issued to them by Chinese commercial firms from British banks.

### British Ships Ordered to Resume Sailing: Mail Ships to be Equipped with Small Cannons

After the War: Permission Granted for Departure

The Japanese Empress, which arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 3rd (three days ago), and the Asian Empress, which arrived in Shanghai from Vancouver on the 4th, were ordered by the British Navy to be prohibited from leaving when they were about to weigh anchor, and their voyages were suspended. According to the company yesterday, they have obtained permission from the British Navy and were scheduled to weigh anchor at 11 o'clock last night. The Japanese Empress is returning to Canada, and the Asian Empress is still scheduled to sail to Hong Kong and Luzon as originally planned. According to the Continental Daily News, the Asian Empress of the China Navigation Company will sail to Vancouver after receiving instructions from the British Admiralty. Company personnel believe that after the Asian Empress arrives in Vancouver, small cannons will be installed on the deck, similar to the Russian Empress, which is currently sailing to Canada. However, they believe that the newest Japanese Empress, which left Shanghai yesterday, will be armed before the slightly older Russian Empress. The Italian ship Giulio Cesare is still berthed at the Texaco Wharf awaiting orders.

Taikoo Ships Resuming Service One After Another

The Shun Tian of the British Taikoo Company's Northern Ports route, originally scheduled to depart on the 4th, and the Qiongzhou, which was scheduled to sail to Xiamen and Hong Kong yesterday, were both ordered to suspend sailing by the British Navy. Yesterday, permission was obtained from the British military authorities, and the Shun Tian was allowed to sail to Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin this morning. The Qiongzhou is still sailing to Xiamen, Hong Kong, Guangzhouwan, Haikou, and Beihai as originally scheduled. The Wu Lin, which sails the Beisha route in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, was ordered to return to Shanghai after leaving port the day before yesterday and is also scheduled to resume service this morning.

Ewo and Other Ships Allowed to Leave Port

The Ewo, Ze Sheng, and Fu Sheng of Jardine Matheson, which were docked in Shanghai, have also been granted permission to leave port. Therefore, the Ewo left port at 6 p.m. yesterday, sailing to Hong Kong and Haiphong. The Ze Sheng is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong empty this morning, and the Fu Sheng is scheduled to sail to Qingdao and Yantai at 3 p.m. today, not going to Tianjin. The Yu Sheng of the same company is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong this afternoon, and the De Sheng is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the Northern Ports on the 8th and sail to Hong Kong on the 9th. Whether these two ships will arrive in Shanghai and leave port on schedule cannot be predicted at present.

Anqing Was Not Shot At

Yesterday morning, it was widely rumored in the city that the Anqing, a Taikoo Company ship of over 3,100 tons sailing the Luzon route, had been shot at by a submarine of a certain country. The company denied this and announced that the ship had telegraphed its Hong Kong headquarters to report its safety, in order to dispel the rumors. However, all the ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo in Shanghai have painted over the British flags and the large characters "British Merchant Ship" on both sides of their hulls with black paint.

American Ships Added to Shanghai-Europe Route

After the outbreak of the war in Europe, the number of British and French ships in the Far East will obviously decrease. It is now known that the American President Lines will send ships to sail between Shanghai and Europe. Previously, the company only had ships sailing on the Pacific route stopping in Shanghai, while the European route only went to Hong Kong and did not come to Shanghai.

### German Ships Cease Operations: Whereabouts of Mail Ships Unknown

German Ships' Whereabouts Cause Much Speculation

The English-language China Press reports that the whereabouts of the three fast ships of the North German Lloyd, the Scharnhorst, the Gneisenau, and the Potsdam, which regularly sail to Shanghai, are a matter of much speculation in the city. It is said that the Scharnhorst was docked in Kobe two days ago, but it is generally believed that the ship has now left that place. The Potsdam did not sail to Bombay as originally planned and is now either in the Indian Ocean or sailing to the coast of South Africa. Among the passengers on board are three people from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, including Deputy Superintendent Kurot. The Gneisenau may be in German territorial waters.

Relying on the End: Extremely Busy

The German shipping company H. M. H. & Co. and the North German Lloyd, managed by Melchers & Co., have announced the suspension of their operations and are handling the winding up. The Scharnhorst of the North German Lloyd previously stopped in Kobe, Japan. Yesterday's news from Japan stated that the ship suddenly left Japan, and its whereabouts are unknown.

The Continental Daily News reports that the German shipping companies in Shanghai were busy yesterday (the 4th) making final preparations for the winding up of their operations. After the North German Lloyd closed its doors at night, the lights were brightly lit, and the Rickmers Line's Rickmers was docked at Wusong.

Yangtze River German Ships Barely Operating

Other small German ships sailing on the Yangtze River are still barely operating on various banks of the Yangtze River and are said to be safe and sound, without being antagonized or detained by the British and French navies. The Moufu, Hanna, and Haifu, three ships sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, are currently temporarily stranded at Qiliyu, outside Zhenhai. In addition, there are six ships of the German Rickmers Line that have been diverted to Dalian, and there are still six ships docked along the coast of that country.

### Shanghai-Europe Postal Service Unimpeded: Post Office Specifies Routes

After the expansion of the war in Europe, whether the mail delivery routes between Shanghai and Europe will be changed and whether there will be any obstacles are of particular concern to the outside world. The following is a summary of the situation:

Post Office Maintains Shanghai-Europe Postal Service

According to Mr. Xu Guanqi, head of the Joint Postal Dispatch Group of the Shanghai Postal Administration, no matter how the war in Europe develops, the post office will do its utmost to maintain postal delivery to Europe and will not allow any obstruction.

Continue to Ship via Three Routes

Regarding the issue of delivery routes between Shanghai and Europe, under normal circumstances, mail is dispatched via three routes: Siberia, the Suez Canal, and the Pacific Ocean. Among them, the Siberian route is the fastest. Therefore, mail for which the sender has not specified a delivery route is transported via this route.

Siberian Delivery Unimpeded

Currently, mail on this route is still being delivered as usual. However, in the past, mail sent from Shanghai to Europe via this route was transferred through Poland after arriving in Moscow. Now that war has broken out in Poland, it may be necessary to transfer it through another route. However, there is still no obstruction to postal delivery on this route.

Suez Canal: Currently Loading on Japanese Ships

As for the Suez Canal route, after the mail ships of various countries such as Britain, France, and Italy temporarily suspended service, only Japanese mail ships are still sailing as usual. Yesterday, a batch of European mail was loaded onto the Japanese mail ship Hakozaki Maru. In the future, there may be fewer ships on this route, but postal delivery will definitely be unimpeded.

Pacific: Loading on American and Japanese Ships

On the Pacific route, the American President Lines has ships that regularly sail, and there may be more ships in the future. There are also many Japanese merchant ships sailing on this route, so it is even more accessible. However, mail sent to Europe via this route must be transferred to another ship to Europe after arriving in New York, which takes a little longer.

European Mail Posting Regulations

Foreign residents in China are very concerned about the safety of their home countries. Therefore, the post office has been extremely crowded with international letters in recent days. However, due to the tension in Europe, international postal delivery is not without difficulties. According to the post office, in order to maintain public mail, even if transportation is obstructed, it will do its best to dredge it. The following is a summary of the postal delivery methods for ordinary, registered, and express mail to various European and Asian countries. All mail sent to Australia, New Zealand, Indochina, Siam, Myanmar, the Dutch East Indies, Egypt, Pacific Islands, Singapore, Malaya, Ceylon, Africa, Britain, and other European countries via the Suez Canal will be transported by the Hakozaki Maru (September 4, 16:00), Hestederkek, Somalia, and Asian Empress. Although remittances are still normal, the number of people opening drafts has decreased.

### European Goods Supply Interrupted: Vigorously Promote Domestic Goods: Domestic Factories Manufacture European Goods Substitutes: Foreign Exchange Stabilizes, Gold Market Rebounds Yesterday

After the outbreak of the war in Europe, merchant ships from Britain, France, Germany, and other countries sailing in the Far East completely suspended service, resulting in the interruption of the supply of European goods. British, French, and German foreign firms in Shanghai have been forced to announce the cancellation of previously signed orders, and sales are limited to Shanghai's existing inventory. For example, industries such as raw materials, hardware, woolens, piece goods, and industrial raw materials are all taking a wait-and-see attitude. Those who hold goods are unwilling to sell them, resulting in soaring prices and chaotic transactions. Chinese merchants, in general, have learned from the profit situation during past European wars and have bought and hoarded goods on the market in an attempt to profit, resulting in today's abnormal situation in the foreign goods market.

Trade with the United States and Soviet Union Not Affected

Regarding the export of native products, except for neutral countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Germany, and other countries have all stopped shipping, resulting in textiles, fibers, animal and animal products, raw leather, tanned leather, leather goods, medicinal materials, and spices, which were mainly sold to Britain, France, Germany, and other countries, have suffered a great impact. Domestic prices have therefore fallen sharply. In the case of Chinese silk, the price has fallen by more than 1,000 yuan per picul. At the same time, the easing of the black market foreign exchange rate has caused the prices of native products to fall. Fortunately, the main native products sold to the United States and the Soviet Union, such as tea, minerals, bristles, and tung oil, have not been significantly affected. The Trade Commission is now doing its utmost to dredge exports.

Domestic Goods Groups: Promotion Opportunities

Various domestic goods groups believe that the high prices of European goods and the interruption of supply are an opportunity to vigorously promote domestic sales, so they hope that the Chinese people will replace imported goods with domestic products, directly reversing the impact of the sluggish sales of native products, and indirectly reducing the overall import surplus, so that China's international balance of payments can be balanced. Recently, the number of domestically produced goods manufactured in Shanghai and imported into the mainland has increased compared to before. This situation is actually beneficial to China's war of resistance. At the same time, there are also some domestic goods factories that are imitating foreign goods to manufacture substitutes. It is said that the quality of these domestically produced goods that replace imported goods is not inferior to that of foreign goods.

Trade between Britain, France, Germany, and Poland and China

Trade between Britain, France, Germany, and Poland and China has almost come to a standstill due to the impact of the war. The voyages of the four countries in the Far East have been interrupted, so trade with China will inevitably be greatly affected from September. The following is a record of trade from January to July: (1) Britain imported 44,689,000 yuan and exported 44,413,300 yuan; (2) France imported 6,538,000 yuan and exported 17,962,000 yuan; (3) Germany imported 59,010,100 yuan and exported 35,600,700 yuan; (4) Poland imported 3,173,000 yuan and exported 6,000 yuan.

Black Market Exchange Rate Slightly Stabilizes

After the Shanghai black market foreign exchange rate eased due to the European war, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation quoted the same price as the day before yesterday, with no change. The actual market exchange rate was 4 pence 6875 for British exchange and 8 yuan 0625 for American exchange. The exchange rate has stabilized slightly. Regarding foreign currency transactions, there are still no transactions in German gold notes, French francs, or Italian lire. The Money Exchange Association announced the market buying and selling prices for the industry this morning: British gold pounds buy 70 yuan and sell 74 yuan, British gold notes buy 43 yuan and sell 45 yuan, American gold pounds buy 73 yuan and sell 77 yuan, American gold notes buy 11 yuan 8 jiao and sell 12 yuan, and Hong Kong notes buy 2 yuan 6 jiao and sell 2 yuan 8 jiao.

Securities Gray Market: Legal Tender Rises

After the securities gray market opened this morning, the value of legal tender increased due to the stability of the market and the increased legal tender value, and the unified bonds rose slightly in the morning and fell slightly in the afternoon. The closing prices are as follows: Type A was 51 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen in the morning and 51 yuan 1 jiao in the afternoon, Type B was 45 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen in the morning and 45 yuan in the afternoon, Type C was 43 yuan 7 jiao in the morning and 43 yuan 4 jiao in the afternoon, there were no transactions in Type D in the morning or afternoon, and Type E was 43 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen in the morning and 43 yuan 2 jiao in the afternoon. As for the value of Chinese legal tender, its value has increased compared to before due to the easing of the black market foreign exchange rate, but the legal price of the Central Bank remains stable as ever.

Gold Rebounds: Swap Points Fall

After the gold gray market opened this morning, rumors abounded in the market, the situation was chaotic, and speculators prevailed, resulting in large fluctuations in prices. The morning closing price was 3,500 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 3,480 yuan, an increase of more than 400 yuan compared to the day before. The initial quotation for silver bullion was 315 yuan, which was later changed to 345 yuan. As for the swap points, the swap point prices fell sharply due to the market being oversupplied. Yesterday, it was about 125 yuan. However, this swap point has already been ordered to be banned by the Ministry of Finance, and it may be eliminated in the future. Moreover, those who operate this swap point are general small money shops.

### Rice Prices Rise and Fall: Active Ordering of Foreign Rice, Hoarders Dare Not Import Too Much: First Batch of Tribute Rice for Price Stabilization Prepared for Customs Clearance and Import

Previously, the price of rice in the city was soaring, and it was difficult for the common people to maintain their livelihoods. Yu Qiaqing and others, in order to maintain the people's food supply, jointly telegraphed the central government and obtained 10,000 pounds of foreign exchange from Finance Minister Kong to order tribute rice for price stabilization. It is said that the first batch of more than 1,800 tons, equivalent to 18,319 bags, has been loaded onto the Norwegian merchant Haida, operated by Wah Lun Shipping Company, and is being transported here. It is currently en route and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 8th or 9th. It has already been reported to the Jianghai Customs. At that time, the price of rice is expected to fall. Yesterday, the amount of rice that arrived in the market under the river was two ships, a total of 530 piculs. In addition, there were more than 1,000 piculs transported to Shanghai by land train. Merchants listed 4,242 bags, all of which were indica rice. The price of rice in the early market had continued to rise by about 2 yuan, but the price in the evening market fell by 4 yuan, averaging a drop of about 2 yuan compared to the day before. There was not much fluctuation in other goods. The reason is that the amount of arrivals is increasing, the appetite of rice shops is limited, and the foreign rice ordered is transported by the Norwegian merchant Haida, which is not affected by the war in Europe, and various industries are still very active in ordering, so hoarders in general dare not import too much.

### US Marine Corps Return to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao

Shortened Summer Training Period for H Company, USS Chaumont Scheduled to Return to the United States Expeditiously

According to the North China Daily News, the USS Chaumont, carrying 176 US Marine Corps soldiers and 30-40 American expatriates who left Tianjin to avoid the floods, arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 p.m. yesterday (the 4th). The American soldiers are from D Company of the 4th Marine Regiment and have been engaged in summer training at the Holcomb Camp in Qinhuangdao for six weeks. The American expatriates who were evacuated are the families of US Navy and Marine Corps officers stationed in Tianjin, mostly women and children. Although some of them regretted leaving their husbands stationed in Tianjin, most of them were indeed very happy to leave the horror of the floods. The USS Chaumont will not

Sail Upstream

The US Navy pontoon is docked at buoys 12 and 13 downstream. The US Marine Corps soldiers and passengers were transported to the Customs Wharf by a tugboat, where they disembarked. The soldiers were then transported to the Xiaoshapu Road Barracks by a convoy of trucks. The USS Chaumont will be docked in Shanghai for eight days and will return to the United States on the 12th of this month via Manila, Guam, and Honolulu. According to reports, the USS Chaumont was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on August 31. However, due to the Tianjin floods,

The Situation Deteriorated

US Asia Fleet Commander Admiral Hart ordered the transport ship to be stationed on the North China Sea in order to evacuate American expatriates avoiding the Tianjin floods. The ship also repeatedly transported supplies from Qinhuangdao to Tanggu to supply the US Marine Corps in Tianjin, which was in the floods, because railway traffic had been cut off. In addition, H Company of the US 4th Marine Regiment, which left on the USS Chaumont for Holcomb Camp in Qinhuangdao on August 23, has been ordered by the commander

To Return to Shanghai

Due to the outbreak of the war in Europe, it was decided to shorten the training period of H Company in North China and return to Shanghai immediately. The USS Marblehead has been dispatched to Qinhuangdao to transport the soldiers back to Shanghai and is scheduled to arrive here today (the 5th).

### Wu Zhiqian's Corpse Prepared for Burial, Position as President of Women's University and Primary and Secondary Schools to Be Succeeded by His Younger Brother Yizhi

Wu Zhiqian, president of the private Shanghai Women's University (and primary and secondary schools) and a native of Tongzhou, was fatally shot in the school the day before yesterday. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the police requested the Special First Court to send a prosecutor and a forensic examiner to the scene to examine Wu's body. The examination revealed that Wu Zhiqian had indeed died from being shot. The body was claimed by the deceased's family member, Wu's younger brother Yizhi, and sent to the Wan Guo Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road. Wu's father, Jueyu (who is 70 years old), and his lifelong friends, together with more than 50 faculty and staff members from the university and primary and secondary schools, held a grand funeral at 2 p.m. They plan to temporarily place the coffin in the funeral parlor and hold the funeral at a later date when the situation is stable, choose a day to send out invitations, and transport the coffin back to Tongzhou for burial. In addition, there is a seven-year-old son named Luoming (who was born while studying at the University of Rome in Italy; Wu's wife is deceased) who is currently studying in the countryside of Tongzhou. As for the aftermath of school affairs, it is said that when Wu Zhiqian was injured and sent to the hospital for treatment in an ambulance, Wu personally instructed his younger brother Wu Yizhi (currently the director of general affairs of the school and a graduate of Meiji University), who accompanied him to the hospital, in the ambulance, saying that if he was seriously injured and in danger of death, Yizhi should succeed him as the president of Shanghai Women's University and primary and secondary schools.

### Three-Fen Tram Tokens: Counterfeit Tokens Discovered, Company Sets Deadline to Collect Genuine Tokens, Public Buses Increase Fares Today

Since the market refused to accept postage stamps, various businesses issued tokens for circulation due to a lack of small change, and unscrupulous people took the opportunity to counterfeit them, resulting in counterfeit tokens being rampant. Recently, someone even counterfeited the tokens of the Shanghai Municipal Council Tramways Company and mixed them in the market. Therefore, the company specifically issued a notice on each tram, "Important Notice to Passengers Regarding Cash Tokens: Counterfeit three-fen value tokens have been found to be mixed in the market. For the benefit of passengers themselves, please do not accept the company's tokens from exchange shops or any stores. The company's tokens should only be

Received from Ticket Sellers

on the company's vehicles." At the same time, the effective date of these limited-time tokens was also specified. The notice stated, "In order to prevent counterfeiting, all of the company's three-fen tokens with the dates of June 1939, July 1939, and August 1939 must be used on the company's vehicles before September 20, 1939. The company will not accept any three-fen tokens with the above dates after September 20, 1939. This notice." Furthermore, the British-owned China

General Omnibus

Company has submitted a request to the Municipal Council to appropriately increase passenger fares. In addition to monthly tickets, which have already increased in price since the 1st, ordinary passenger tickets will also be increased starting today. The newly revised detailed price list for each route and money station has already been printed by the company and posted in each bus compartment. Subsequently, the ticket price will increase by about two fen compared to before. Due to the lack of one-fen auxiliary coins, all odd-numbered fares have been changed to even numbers, so the lowest value has also increased to four fen.

### Second Examination of Exchange Drawing

After the implementation of the new exchange drawing system in the silver and money industry, each bank and shop provided collateral and obtained interbank exchange drawing from the Bank United Preparation Committee. As of the end of July, the amount used was 14,751,100 yuan. Now, the Exchange Drawing Preparation Inspection Committee has implemented the second examination in accordance with the inspection rules (from August 1 to August 31). Chairman Xu Jilun, together with accountant Pan Xulun, examined the collateral and total amount of interbank exchange drawing used by all banks and money shops. Once the examination is completed, a public announcement will be made to show great credibility. (Also, yesterday's report on the number of exchange drawing used from August 20 to August 26 was not true. The number was actually the number of exchange drawing notes exchanged by the silver and money industry from August 13 to August 19, not the amount of interbank exchange drawing used by each bank and shop. We hereby make a correction.)

### Tianjin Assassination Case: Four Chinese Not Extradited: Reports from Tianjin that They Have Been Handed Over Are Not Accurate, British Court Date Set

Regarding the four Chinese suspects detained in the Tianjin British Concession in the case of the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the Arnhold & Company law firm in Shanghai, entrusted by the Pitman & Holford law firm in London, applied to the British Supreme Court in Shanghai for habeas corpus. On August 30, a telegram from Tianjin reported that the British Concession authorities had decided to hand over the four suspects to the Japanese side on the 31st. The British court judge immediately sent a telegram to Tianjin at 4 p.m. on the 31st, requesting the British Concession authorities to announce the evidence against the four suspects, indicating that the court was accepting the case. Whether the four had been handed over or not, the British judge's telegram was sent too late, and was a matter of concern to both Chinese and foreigners. A telegram from Tianjin yesterday reported that the four had been handed over, and all circles felt that there was no hope for the case. Subsequently, reliable news from the Arnhold & Company law firm confirmed that the four had not been handed over, and the reports from the outside were purely false. The date for the trial of this case has been set for September 11 (next Monday). At that time, Sir Moseley, the chief justice of the British Supreme Court, will have returned to Shanghai and will conduct the trial.

### Employees of American Enterprises Company Collude to Embezzle Medicines, Secretly Transporting and Selling for Profit, Three Arrested Together After Case Exposed

Lu Jingfang, a native of Ningbo, was an inspector at the American Enterprises Company at 7 Xinanhe Temple Road in Shanghai. In February of this year, Lu suddenly had a malicious idea and intended to secretly transport the company's products out. He secretly discussed this with Zhang Zhiruan, also a native of Ningbo and an employee of the company, and colluded with Zhou Zhongyi, a doctor of Western medicine from Songjiang who resided at 46 Huacheng Road in the French Concession, to

of the stolen goods and transportation. After the agreement was reached, Lu, Zhang, and others first stole blank order forms from a certain pharmacy that had a relationship with the company, filled them out with goods, and successively transported out vanillin, cod liver oil, and Cresyl oil worth 7,446 yuan and 5 jiao 1 fen. Zhou Zhongyi prepared a truck to transport the goods and stored them in the Qiangzhongxing in the Xin Shou An Lane on Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession, and successively sold them for profit. However, in June, Zhang Zhiruan was suddenly dismissed from the company. Until recently, Zhang suddenly

The case still needs to be investigated, and a request was made to change the date. After questioning by the judge, the defendants were ordered to be detained and the date was changed for further investigation.

### Counterfeiting of Vouchers Leads to Charges of Forgery

Due to the shortage of small currency in Shanghai, businesses commonly issue vouchers for small change transactions to facilitate exchanges. However, some unscrupulous individuals are taking advantage of the situation by engaging in widespread counterfeiting, causing confusion and severely impacting society. The Da Yu Shun Sauce Garden at 134 Rue Cardinal Foch also issues such vouchers. Unexpectedly, two men from Danyang, Wu Zhongxiao and Zhao Guanghui, secretly approached the Da Zhong Guo Printing House at 739 Rue Niu Zhuang and requested them to

Duplicate the Vouchers

They printed 2,500 vouchers for the sauce garden, each with a face value of two cents, and bearing a chop, and attempted to use them fraudulently at shops along Rue Cardinal Foch. On the afternoon of the 4th, Wu Zhongxiao again used counterfeit vouchers to purchase goods at a cigarette and paper shop at 147 Rue Cardinal Foch. At the time, Shen Xinguang, a clerk from Da Yu Shun Sauce Garden, was also in the shop. He apprehended Wu Zhongxiao and confirmed that the vouchers being used were indeed counterfeit. He then reported the matter to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Detective Wang Siming, who arrested Wu, along with 45 counterfeit vouchers found on his person, and

Took him to the Police Station.

Under interrogation, Wu confessed that he and Zhao Guanghui had jointly counterfeited a total of 2,500 vouchers, of which he had obtained 250, and had already spent over 200 of them. The remaining 2,250 vouchers, along with the chop, were taken away by Zhao, he said. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Wu to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit according to the law, requesting severe punishment. After the judge questioned Wu clearly, he was remanded in custody pending sentencing on a later date. Furthermore,

The He Ji Food Company

At 1921 Jing An Temple Road, recently started to print their own one-cent and two-cent vouchers for change due to the unavailability of stamps. However, they discovered that similar counterfeit vouchers were being used to purchase goods at their company. The manager, Hua Junwei, was informed that these counterfeit vouchers were printed by the Hai Ning Printing House at 1008 Hai Ning Road. He reported this to the relevant police station of the Huisi precinct. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched

Secretly to the Address

They arrested Qiu Xigen (25 years old) from Qingpu, the owner of the printing house, and seized 24,000 printed one-cent and two-cent He Ji Company vouchers. He confessed that the vouchers were printed on the recommendation of his friend Peng Ruixiang from Haimen, who worked at the Huizhong Printing House at 7 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. The detectives then went to the Huizhong Printing House in the French Concession,

And apprehended Peng.

Both were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and charged them with forgery, requesting an extension to present the counterfeit vouchers for inspection and to question the two defendants. Their statements were evasive. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them remanded in custody for further verification at a later date.

### Worker Wu San Tragically Stabbed to Death

Wu San, 41 years old, from Dongtai, and Zhu Jiuru, from Rugao, are both laborers working for Lu Lianfu's truck company on Xinkaihe Road. Three days ago, Wu San set up a makeshift bed in the loft of the Wanfu Chang Clothing Store at 50 Xiangshun Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession. Suddenly, at around 9 PM last night, Zhu Jiuru gathered a group of thugs and stormed into the loft where Wu was staying. In a threatening manner, they forced Wu to go outside to talk. Wu refused to go out. Seeing that something was amiss, Tai, a clothing apprentice from the second landlord, and Zhou Guangzhao, rushed to the entrance of the lane to call the Chinese police on duty. However, before the police arrived, Zhu ordered the thugs to stab Wu twice in the chest. As they were about to flee, they were intercepted by the patrol police guarding the lane. A sharp weapon used in the attack was seized. They were taken to the police station. Unfortunately, Wu's injuries were critical. He collapsed at the entrance of the Fuyuan Sauce Garden at the intersection of Kangti Road. The police hired a rickshaw to take him to the police station. They were about to transfer him to the hospital, but he died due to his severe injuries. The suspect is temporarily detained in the police station, awaiting transfer to the Second Special District Court for punishment. The motive for the attack is said to have stemmed from a work-related feud.

### Editor Co-habits with Female Proofreader, Wife Reports Adultery

Wife Initially Agreed, Then Changes Her Mind, Court Orders Postponement to Summon Witnesses for Further Verification

Author Chu Yi, 35 years old, originally from Yi, has authored works such as "Eight Hundred Famous Ancient and Modern Essays," "Student's Small Vocabulary," "Model Essay Dictionary," and "One Hundred Volumes of Children's Common Knowledge Series." He currently edits the Composition Self-Study Magazine and runs the Oriental Bookstore at 134 Avenue Edward VII. Chu previously married Feng Wanfang, a woman from Jin, through a matchmaker named Feng Chengfu. After the marriage, Feng disdained Chu's poor financial situation and

Looked Down on Her In-laws. At the time, Chu was still studying. Chu's father died of anger due to family turmoil. After Chu graduated, Feng demanded to live separately. Later, through the mediation of the matchmaker Feng Chengfu, the couple separated. Feng's living expenses were paid by Chu on a monthly basis. Feng allowed Chu to remarry. In 1933, Chu joined the Beixin Bookstore as an editor. Later, he fell in love with Yao Yunying, a female proofreader from Yuyao at the World Bookstore (31 years old), due to their friendship. They co-edited the "National Studies Outline," which deepened their

Love. In March 1934, Chu fell ill and failed to send living expenses to Feng. Feng's father sent a letter to Chu on behalf of his daughter, stating, "Unless you break away from Yao Yunying, the living expenses cannot be interrupted." In October of the same year, Feng came to Shanghai for direct negotiations, voluntarily agreeing not to cohabit with Chu in Shanghai again. Chu would provide her with 20 yuan per month for living expenses, and she allowed Chu to cohabit with Yao Yunying. Therefore, on October 11 of the same year, a contract was signed by lawyer Xu Yuxiang, and Chu began cohabiting with Yao Yunying. In April 1935, Feng came to Shanghai with her father and aunt and visited the

Co-habitation Place of Chu and Yao

In Jingde Lane, Baoshan Road, without any objections. In June of this year, Chu invited Feng to Shanghai to escape the unrest in his hometown, with all expenses borne by Chu. On July 14, Chu suffered from an epidemic, and Feng also visited Chu and Yao at their cohabitation place. Later, Chu returned to his hometown due to his mother's illness. Feng recently hired a lawyer to negotiate with Chu for an increase in living expenses. Although Chu returned to Shanghai, he did not pay the large sum demanded by Feng. On the night of the 17th of last month, Feng reported to the News Police Station and caught Chu and Yao in adultery at the Oriental Bookstore. After investigation, the police summoned Chu and Yao Yunying to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday

For prosecution according to law. Judge Meng presided over the trial. The plaintiff, Feng Wanfang, testified that she only discovered her husband's affair after coming to Shanghai, so she reported the adultery. The defendant, Chu Yi, claimed that he had obtained Feng's consent when he began cohabiting with Yao Yunying. Yao Yunying testified that when she began cohabiting with Chu in October 1934, there was not only a lawyer's testimony but also a celebratory banquet. After verifying the statements, the court ordered a postponement for further investigation and questioning.

### Collapsing Wall Injures Two Women

Chen Guo, an old woman from Zhenjiang, 51 years old, and Wang Ding, 70 years old, both lived at 8, Lane 157, Haig Road, Western District of Shanghai. At around 8 PM yesterday, after finishing their meal, they carried bamboo stools to the courtyard to cool off and chat due to the hot weather.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor,

Having read the "Loss of Both Money and Wife: Newly Rich Accused of Fraud" in the local news section of your newspaper on the 4th of this month, it stated that "Fa Xing Rong Meat Shop at 2082 Haig Road, given meat to proprietor Chen Feizhang, who had also acted as the President of Ji Wang Temple 'Maintenance Committee' and so on."

We fear that this misinformation will affect the reputation of our shop. We request that you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to correct the error.

Sincerely,
Zheng Rongqi, Fa Xing Rong Meat Shop

### European War Does Not Affect Shanghai Western Football League, Thirty-Four Teams Register to Participate, Only Six Teams Registered for the First Division

The European war is something that will affect the Shanghai Western Football League this year, and it is of great concern to the local football community. According to the authorities of the Shanghai Western Football Club, this year's plan will proceed as usual unless unforeseen events occur, in which case further consideration will be given. Registration closed yesterday, with a total of thirty-four teams registered in the three divisions A, B, and C. Some teams will join in the coming days. Due to the involvement of the British army in the war, the British army team will likely not be able to participate this year, and they may have no interest in it. The navy is also difficult to determine.

The 1939-40 Shanghai Western Football League registration closed at 5:00 PM on the 5th (yesterday). Michael Wynn of the Western Football Club will announce the full list, saying that it must be announced three days later. It is known that there are six teams in the First Division, the same as the reserve division, eight teams in the Second Division, and fourteen teams in the Third Division, for a total of thirty-four teams, but there may be additions in the coming days.

Six Teams in the First Division

In the First Division, of last year's nine teams, the French Chamber of Commerce is still deliberating and considering due to the European situation, but it is likely to participate. The East Serlai team will soon be transferred. Their replacement team is not yet known and must wait until their arrival before registering. The Zhendan team, which finished fourth in the First Division last year, has voluntarily withdrawn to the Third Division. Other teams such as Donghua, Western Police, and Portuguese One are participating as usual. These are the six teams in the First Division.

Lido Issue

However, there are still two teams that are qualified to participate in the First Division, but they must be approved by the new executive committee elected at the annual meeting, namely Lido and North Western Boys. Lido was the champion of last year's Scott Cup and also fought the joint army team in the charity match, but winning the Scott Cup does not immediately qualify them for promotion to the First Division. However, according to predictions from relevant parties, it can be cited as an example that Donghua was selected into the First Division as a new member. North Western Boys was the runner-up in last year's Second Division, and their promotion to the First Division may be problematic. The lists of teams in each division obtained from various sources are as follows:

First Division (6 teams): Donghua Club, Portuguese Chamber of Commerce, Western Police Club, St. Francis, Western Firth, Lacus. To be reviewed for promotion (2 teams): Lido Club, North Western Boys. Reserve Division (same as above)

Second Division (8 teams): Survey, Youth, Friendship, Junior, Jewish, Russian Army, Sukel, Yaperun.

Third Division (14 teams): Zhendan, Peide, Park United, Russian Emigrants, Health, Tongwen, Vitells, Jovens, Rowing Club, Survey, Jewish, Holy Light, Leisure, Herzi Fort. New members to be reviewed (2 teams): Golian, Marsk.

Fudan has now won all seven matches and won the First Division championship. Fang Gang's captain, Zheng Yiquan, showed good skills but lacked good attitude, insulting the referee, causing an uproar in the audience.

### Meat Market

— Mang Mang

The fresh meat industry has already gone on strike because it is unwilling to be unreasonably controlled.

This is actually not a very serious social problem. Strictly speaking, pork can only be considered a luxury item, not a necessity. People can still live without pork. Moreover, the working masses have always lived without pork. Since the outbreak of the war, due to economic constraints, the group of people who do not eat pork has expanded from the proletariat to the lower middle class. This is naturally not because they do not want to eat meat, but because of their weak purchasing power.

Originally, in this extraordinary period, only by enduring hardship and being resilient can one have a real guarantee of one's own life, and by extension, the country and the nation will also receive a lot of help. Therefore, any form of "thrift" is worth promoting. So, going from passively (restricted by purchasing power) to actively not eating pork is not a meaningless thing.

The fact that pork does not have a significant relationship with society can be seen in the two strikes. Neither strike caused social unrest or panic, which cannot be compared with the turmoil when there is a shortage of rice. The reason is that pork has become the private property of the propertied class, and the propertied class has the power to replace meat with other things. Therefore, the current society, in which the lower middle class and the proletariat make up the majority, has not been disturbed by the cessation of pork.

However, we cannot ignore the occurrence of this problem, and we must further explore the cause and consequences of this problem.

It is obvious that the manipulation of pork has a political role that goes beyond commercial considerations. The direct impact of this event is not on the entire society, but on the pork merchants, and the indirect impact is on the butchers. Since the conflicting parties are so simple, those who are eager to find a solution will inevitably be the pork merchants, as described below.

"The fresh meat industry sent six representatives yesterday morning at 10:00 AM (two each from the International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Hongkou District) to Hongkou to negotiate with the 'Livestock Market,' requesting (1) the abolition of the auction system and the restoration of the original method of weighing by the catty; (2) the reduction of selling prices to maintain the meat supply in Shanghai. Manager Songyuan of the 'Market' stated that because the current auction system is based on Japanese domestic methods, he would agree to submit a request to the 'Asia Development Board' to abolish it, and at the same time advised the meat industry to resume business immediately, and set a date for the representatives to go to the 'Asia Development Board' to request." (This newspaper)

In this short piece of news, the attitudes of both parties have been written very clearly. And we believe that such negotiations by the fresh meat industry will not yield results. This can be proven by "Why pork prices are soaring even though it is not an imported product" and the results of the last strike. Even if the other party makes a slight concession on the surface, no one can guarantee that the third "pork incident" will not happen again.

Why are pork merchants doing this? To put it plainly, in order to maintain their own interests. And the other party is trying to amass capital for a "long-term war." We only need to weigh the gains and losses slightly to feel that the path that the fresh meat industry is currently taking is not the best one.

Yes, the current passive resistance of the fresh meat industry is only a temporary strike, because although the strike hurts its own interests, it also undermines the other party's attempts. Perhaps, when their own interests are harmed, there will be genuine concessions. In this struggle, the employees of the fresh meat industry—the butchers—will of course suffer. Fortunately, they are strong and able to get a little help from their employers, so they will not starve to death.

We are not absolutely opposed to eating pork, and we sympathize with the situation and experience of the fresh meat industry: but, we are unwilling to eat pork that poisons us!

### Is the Wool Coming from the Sheep?

— Weaker

In last month's issue of this publication, a subtenant wrote an article entitled "The Landlord and Second Landlord's Wishful Thinking." That kind of get-rich-quick mentality that feared no chaos in the world was almost as clear as a floodlight, allowing those of us who are subtenants to see it clearly. But what's the point of seeing it clearly? Thirty yuan for a pavilion upstairs, one hundred yuan for a regular厢 room. No families allowed, no guarantors, no rent. The amount of security deposit, the number of tips, and the variety of items were alarming! Some people used to say that "Shanghainese moving is like mice moving," but now, let alone moving, even a single man trying to find a place to shelter from the wind and rain is not an easy thing. Even if you are lucky enough to have more favorable conditions and get a head start, and then save money and try to get through this difficult time, the fishermen who fish in troubled waters will never give up every opportunity that comes their way. If there is any disturbance, not only will the wool come from the sheep, but the wool collectors will overcharge the sheep. We all rented houses after the war, and the house prices have increased dozens of times out of proportion, but when the land tax increases, the second landlord immediately divides it among the tenants. And dozens of percentages are allocated over the hundreds of percentages out of the proportion increase in the rent, and isn't this bit by bit, a small fortune? Now the electricity price has increased again. The International Settlement is 112%, and the French Concession is 60% (including the previous 15% increase). With this feather duster as an imperial decree, the second landlord is eloquent and immediately divides it among the tenants. For example, I live in the French Concession, and the rent for a front building is 35 yuan. When the land tax and water fee increased last time, it was "allocated" by 20%, which is 42 yuan at the current price. The electric light is stipulated to be 32 candle power. If you speak honestly, the second landlord should be satisfied. Even if the electricity bill now increases by 45%, the 45% of a 32 candle power light is very small, but his "allocation" method is really clever: they calculate the number of light bulbs in the entire house, and after calculation, each bulb increases by one yuan. At first glance, this method seems very fair, but what is the actual situation? Let me tell you: the subtenant's electric lights are turned on at 6:00 PM and turned off at 12:00 AM, and they are on for six hours; their electric lights are bright, and they are on all night, and there are electric fans, electric irons, etc. Under such an unequal consumption ratio, if you want to allocate according to household, isn't the saying that the wool comes from the sheep a too beautiful word!

### Tears Bought in the West

— Wang Yizhi

Beechwood

Located below Qiongxuan,

A path of green reaches the door,

Chickens and dogs and gods in an instant,

Hibiscus city and Willow Grove Park.

The Beechwood Girls' School is of good quality and low price, but unfortunately, an oriental woman has already gotten there first. If Mao Yi had entered this school, she might have been spared the difficulty of the plague, but she couldn't, isn't that fate? The fireworks at Willow Grove Park are as beautiful as flowers, and there are hundreds of plays in many forms, which can be compared to the fairyland of Hibiscus City.

Clear ripples connecting the green to the sky,

Pavilions in the wind and cloud, colorful pens are beautiful,

Fragrance of clothes on the bridge, trees beyond flowers,

Spirits always circle around Phoenixville.

Gay Street in Phoenixville has pavilions in the wind and cloud, which are quiet and beautiful. Gay Street Bridge is magnificent in structure, and you can see the whole city from the bridge. In the shadow of the setting sun, young girls pass over the bridge, or stop in the courtyards of the houses in the Gay Street area, which are unique and beautiful, and Mao Yi always sketches on the bridge.

Adorning the window, the sound of the shadows is clear and charming,

Clouds and rosy clouds coming out of the sea are like brocade,

A unique secluded residence in a corner of the world,

The endless autumn colors reach the eyebrows.

Cape May Point faces the Atlantic Ocean, and has the beauty of morning clouds and evening rosy clouds in the long summer. Just because the female schoolmates all speak a certain Central European language, their attitude is estranged from the new students, and Mao Yi has been unhappy since then.

The dew is new on the eastern side of America,

The fragrance of fallen leaves is better than good spring,

It's just that there is a fate that cannot be thrown away,

The sky is full of sadness.

In October, when Mao Yi passed away, the yellow leaves were flying and the autumn colors were gorgeous.

The poems above all describe the scenery on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, and can be read as travel poems of the New World, to supplement the shortcomings of "Observations on a Trip to America." (The End)

### When You Receive a Compensation Coupon

— (Gu Zhibin)

When you receive a compensation coupon, first, you should pay attention to the name of the store on the coupon; second, pay attention to the address of the store; third, pay attention to the printing and paper of the coupon. If the address of the issuer of the coupon is very far away, or the coupon only has the name of the store but no address, or the printed address is not clear, or the printing is blurred and causes doubt, you can refuse to accept it. Because after receiving a compensation coupon with a distant address, when you use the coupon for payment, you will either be rejected by others, or the recipient of the coupon will not directly go to the store to use it, and can only put the coupon in a high place; or the address is unknown and the coupon is fake, so it cannot be cashed or used, which is equivalent to waste paper.

(Editor's Note: The fundamental solution is to ask each store to temporarily use postage stamps.)

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter Fifteen: Overseas Gossip Suddenly Welcomes Peach Leaves; The Scenery in the Fire Shines like a Lotus Flower

Originally, the He sisters were planning to go to Liberty Village again in a week. To see the self-government of that village, and their matter of renting land to build a factory could also be decided by the village council. But now they cannot go to Liberty Village, because their father's friend Jiang Jingrong is coming to Shanghai on Monday. Didn't the telegram from their father ask them to go to Shanghai to meet him? The telegram also said: all the funds will be remitted by him, and they need funds to prepare everything, so they have to contact him. Their father's telegram also said that he had run a silk weaving factory and had experience, and that he was also one of the shareholders, and they should go to see him in person. Maybe he was the one who initiated the silk weaving factory. Their father's telegram was brief and did not say anything in detail, asking them to go and see him in person, maybe there were many things to discuss. Their father specifically mentioned these in the telegram, which could be seen. Moreover, they have no experience in running a factory at the moment, and this Mr. Jiang, since their father said that he has experience, they should ask him for advice on everything. It is said that running a silk weaving factory was not easy in the past, and the new ones they called electric silk weaving factories. Running a factory has a great relationship with the social environment. China's equipment is not complete, and the workers' skills are not advanced. No matter how great your ability is, you will often end up struggling and not getting anything in return. However, the purpose of opening silk weaving factories in China in the past was only to sell them domestically, which is not very similar to their intentions. If they only want to sell them domestically, then there are not a few newly established silk weaving factories now. China has been able to weave silk for thousands of years. They thought: in any case, this Mr. Jiang, their father said that he has experience, so he is stronger than those of them without experience. At this time, they had to go and discuss with Zhu Airen that they were going to Shanghai next Sunday and could no longer go to Liberty Village. That night, seeing that Zhu Airen had finished a day of medical work, the sisters came to Zhu Airen's room. As soon as they walked in, they saw Zhu Airen holding a few pink invitation cards in her hand, smiling and said: "I was just about to find you! We are going to another place next week, and we can't go to Liberty Village." He Liyu said: "What do you mean? We were also just about to find you, and also to tell you that we can't go to Liberty Village next week. You said you were going to another place, but where are you going?" Zhu Airen handed the invitation cards in her hand to them and said: "Look! Jin Danyun didn't tell me last time in Suzhou that the wedding day was next week, she is a very naughty person, but now she has sent an invitation card." (178)

Entertainment World

### Nan Tiesheng Shows His Colors for the First Time; Zhang Eyun Makes a Comeback

— Nai Wei

The first batch of actors at the Golden Grand Theater's autumn opening originally included Song Dezhu, one of the four famous dan performers, Yang Baosen, and Wu Yanheng, a martial arts actor. However, due to the Tianjin flood, these actors will not be able to come south for the time being. To remedy the situation, the Golden Grand Theater invited Nan Tiesheng to Shanghai (Nan Tiesheng had just gone north from Shanghai last month) to perform for one week.

Nan Tiesheng is from Hubei, born and raised in the old capital, a family of high-ranking officials, a scholarly family. His father, General Chao Yue, was the garrison commander of Wuhan. Tiesheng has a long history of performing in Wuhan. His first teacher was the famous amateur performer Cheng Junmou. In 1923, he made his debut, performing "Yutangchun." Because his singing, acting, and makeup resembled Wan Hua (Mei Lanfang), he was known as the "Mei Lanfang of Hankou." Later, he went north to Yan Zhao and joined the ranks of the veteran actor Wang Yaoqing. Yaoqing loved him very much and considered him the only talent after Zhang Xiaoshan (also a student of Yaoqing and an old amateur performer in the old capital). Tiesheng's art is entirely based on Wan Hua. Since he became a student of Yaoqing, he has combined the essence of Mei and Wang in one furnace. He has a good reputation in Wuhan, and insiders also praise him a lot. Tiesheng's voice is exceptionally sweet, and his singing and tune are wonderful. This time, he came to Shanghai from Wuhan and then went north, in response to the call of his teacher Wang Yaoqing. Because the owner of the Golden Grand Theater repeatedly invited him, he could not refuse, so he returned to Shanghai on the original route a few days ago. It is scheduled to perform at the Golden Grand Theater from the 8th for one week, with three days of warm-up plays: "Chunqiu Pei," "Deyi Yuan," "Xun Guan Niang" (daytime), and "Yuzhou Feng" (night). The Golden Grand Theater's original cast remains unchanged. New actors Lan Yuechun and Xiao Linghong will perform on stage at the same time as Tiesheng. In addition, because there is no suitable candidate for the young male role, the veteran actor Chen Tongyun has been invited to join. Tongyun's young male role is also considered typical. Ten years ago, he had a good reputation in the old capital and collaborated with the famous actor Xun Huisheng for a long time. After coming south, he retired and lived at home, only performing a few times at the banquets of Chen Meng Kui Long's family. This time, Tongyun will be able to perform on stage with Tiesheng at the same time, which is a great boon for the audience.

Nan Tiesheng's invitation to the Golden Grand Theater is only for one week. After Tiesheng finishes performing, kun performer Zhang Eyun (who came to Shanghai on the same rotation as Tiesheng a few days ago) will follow up and sing for one week. The young male role is still Chen Tongyun, and the invitation for the bearded male role is in progress, either An Shuyuan or Zhou Xiaotian. The greater possibility is An Shuyuan. Shuyuan has not been to the sea for many years. If it becomes a reality, he will perform with Tuiyun, and there will definitely be a grand occasion at that time. As for Song Dezhu, Yang Baosen, Wu Yanheng and his party, who are blocked in Beiping and cannot go, it is likely that they will come to Shanghai after Zhang Eyun finishes performing.

### The Theaters of the Wartime Capital

— Hui

There were not many cinemas in Chongqing originally. The only ones with relatively complete facilities were "Cathay," "Xinchuan," and "Unique." After the May 4th fire, "Cathay" was burned down, "Xinchuan" was bombed, and the other cinemas also closed one after another. The only one that still maintained business in the midst of hardship was "Unique." The area of "Unique" is not very large, and part of it has been turned into a refugee shelter, so its position is even smaller. The cinema shows new defense films and valuable Soviet films produced by "China Made" and "China Electric." Recently, the cinema showed new defense films such as "Isolated City Bleeding" and "Blood Splattered Baoshan City," and Soviet films such as "Gorky's Childhood," "Female Warrior," "Crushing the Enemy's Nest," and "Maritime Guard." Not long ago, the cinema also screened an anti-Nazi film "Professor Mamen" produced by the Soviet Leningrad Film Studio, which was protested by the German ambassador and caused a lot of twists and turns. As a result, it continued to be screened. When the Soviet-German agreement was signed, the new Soviet ambassador Pan Youxin applied to stop the screening, and the cinema changed to screen the new "China Made" film "Good Husband."

On July 3, the city of Chongqing was attacked at night, and the backstage and screen of the "Unique" cinema were all bombed. According to the usual practice, it could not be reopened, but "Unique" still persevered and held the spirit of excellence.

In the corner that was bombed, a temporary cloth screen was built, and it was reopened as usual, but only one show was screened at night, and the situation was quite like that of Madrid.

The walls of the "Cathay" cinema that were burned down in the fire have now been completely repaired, and it will also be opened soon. The purpose of opening the cinema is mainly to make money, so it will still show the consistent American soft films, but the Chongqing Garrison Command believes that American soft films are not suitable for opening in the wartime capital, and it is said that it will issue a warning to the cinema to stop it.

### "Children of the Storm" Did Not Encounter "The Robbery of Peach and Plum"; The Kidnapping of Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er Is Not True

— Hui Cun

—— Zheng Junli's wife Huang Chen Talks About Returning to Chongqing from Shaanxi ——

Although Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er did not cooperate on many films, none of them were not famous works. Their special style and excellent performances were by no means accidental, but had their own superior talent and unique experience.

After the August 13th Incident, the two of them left the isolated island of material and vain enjoyment and went to Hankou, and jointly joined the China Film Studio. Last year, they co-starred in a new defense film "Eight Hundred Heroes," which was released and well received. Later, when the Chinese army withdrew from Wuhan, "China Made" moved to Chongqing, and Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er also went west with them.

Not long ago, Yuan Muzhi was assigned by an official of "China Made" to go to northern Shaanxi to shoot news films on the ground. At the same time, he also followed the Eighth Route Army to engage in drama work in the guerrilla areas. Chen Bo'er also left Chongqing soon after and came to Shaanxi to participate in the work.

Recently, "China Made" actor Dai Hao returned to Chongqing from northern Shaanxi. According to him, Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er set off from the Eighth Route Army Detachment Headquarters in western Shanxi on July 21. They risked crossing the cordon, hoping to go deep into the interior to engage in propaganda work. When they passed Tianjiazhai, they wanted to continue to venture forward, but they were discovered by Japanese sentries and were both kidnapped. Yuan Muzhi was shot and killed for trying to escape, and Chen Bo'er was taken to the "Division Headquarters." Their life or death is still unknown.

When Chongqing learned of this bad news, it was greatly shocked, and the Associated Press and Express News also sent this news to various places. As a result, newspapers in Hong Kong and Shanghai published it one after another, causing everyone to feel infinite anxiety. However, because the news came so abruptly, it was ultimately difficult to believe. Now, friends of Yuan and Chen in Chengdu have specially established a preparatory committee for this matter, preparing to first start to visit the whereabouts of Yuan and Chen. If they are unfortunately found to have died for real, then they will start preparing for the memorial service. However, according to Ms. Huang Chen, the wife of Zheng Junli, who had just returned to Chongqing from northern Shaanxi, this news is absolutely untrue, because she had met Yuan and Chen once before leaving Shaanxi!

From this point of view, then Yuan and Chen are still safe and sound. We wish them well here.

### Hopes for the Song and Dance World

— Liang Yan

—— Everyone should write some more vigorous plays

I think no one will deny that the song and dance troupes currently performing in Shanghai are in the darkest process. Although half of it is caused by the environment, it is not without reason that they have given up on themselves. It is as if a child who has just left the arms of his parents can now be unrestrained and unruly. Adults use songs and dances such as grass skirts to attract audiences with lust to maintain their lives.

I think that the current song and dance troupes, having a large audience, should also fulfill some responsibilities to the society and the country, and should write some more vigorous plays in the songs and dances. If you break superstition, promote domestic goods, help refugees, and promote justice, etc., you must not think that every move will be stopped by the environment. For example, several troupes are now performing plays such as "The Autocratic Empress" and "Rejecting Drugs," which are all good works with profound meaning and easy to understand.

Recently, I happened to go to the New World Amusement Park and saw the "Yunshang Great Song and Dance Troupe" performing, and the results were good, which is very rare. The troupe has none of the corrupt situations of other troupes, there are many talents, and the band is neat, which is indeed outstanding among the song and dance troupes. It is said that the director of the troupe is movie star Ma Loufen. This gentleman has a lot of experience in song and dance, and it is expected that he will make a contribution, but what we hope is: to eliminate the remaining poison in the song and dance troupes as much as possible, and to write some more vigorous opera.

### Unofficial Chronicles of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Busy Theatergoers and "Eating Flying"

Furthermore, they want to boast before their peers, saying a certain boss is generous to me, a certain elder is generous to me. Especially when they are in public places, or in tea houses, restaurants, or bathhouses, they deliberately raise their voices, repeating the same thing over and over again. Such self-promotion and intentional publicity are indeed quite beneficial to them. Their intention is simply to let society know that they have a close relationship with the leading actors of the Pear Garden. Then, when high-ranking officials, dignitaries, gentry, and wealthy families have large theatrical performances, they can be found to act as theatrical organizers, or they can be entrusted to invite actors on their behalf. In this way, they will have income; maybe they can even earn one or two thousand dollars. Such people can be considered top-notch busy theatergoers, and the actors dare not despise them too much. The most pitiful are those shameless, disrespectful fellows who, when they have nothing to do, specialize in running to the actors' lodgings, regardless of whether people pay attention to them or not, always sitting until the bench leg breaks without leaving, trying to chat with the leading actors, who ignore them. As soon as they step out of the door, they hear people laughing and scolding. However, they are not annoyed at all. As soon as a certain actor's theater has a performance, they rush to applaud and shout "Bravo!" shouting until their throats are hoarse, but they are reluctant to buy a pot of tea (of course, the theater ticket is obtained for free). Their hands are shaken red and swollen, causing the official customers in front, behind, left, and right (who all paid for their tickets) to sneer and glare at them. But they don't care and still try hard to shout. When a certain actor's performance ends, and the theater owner sends the day's earnings, this gentleman can actually get one or two dollars of income. Although this amount of money is very small, it is extremely difficult to write an appropriate name for it when the accounts are opened. (93)
