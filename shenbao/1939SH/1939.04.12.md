### Continuous Victories in Counteroffensive on Guangzhou: Gan Chinese Army Approaching Nanchang Suburbs; Shilong Recovered, Confirming Japanese Army's Retreat Northward along Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway; Japanese Army Lands at Nantou, Advancing Towards Shenzhen; Chinese Aircraft Bomb Japanese Barracks in Huangpu, Setting Fires after Being Hit

(Hong Kong) Foreign News. The Chinese army is counterattacking Guangzhou and achieving continuous victories. According to those who escaped from Guangzhou to Shiqi, they witnessed a continuous stream of wounded Japanese soldiers being transported back to Yueyuan [Guangzhou] for treatment. It is also reported that the counterattacking forces of the 12th Army Group have crossed Jiangcun, only ten miles from Guangzhou, with the second target being Shijing. This place is a key point in the outer defenses of northern Guangdong, with a considerable number of Japanese troops stationed there. The Chinese army may once again seize Shengang first in the northeast corner, heading directly to Guangzhou, making it difficult for the Japanese army to take care of everything. The recovery of Shilong by the Chinese army is confirmed, and the Japanese army has retreated northward along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. (Special dispatch, 8 PM on the 11th)

(Hong Kong) Shenzhen News. 1,400 Japanese soldiers landed this morning at Nantou, one mile outside the Hong Kong border, and are advancing towards Shenzhen. The situation on the Leizhou Peninsula is becoming tense due to the impact of the war in Siyi [the four counties of Taishan, Xinhui, Kaiping, and Enping], and the Japanese are continuously increasing their troops in Qiongyai [Hainan Island], seemingly planning to attack Xuwen and Beihai. (Special dispatch, 8 PM on the 11th)

(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong Air Force authorities dispatched multiple reconnaissance aircraft this morning around 3 AM to conduct aerial reconnaissance and protect Hong Kong's airspace. (Special dispatch, morning of the 12th)

(Hong Kong) Chongqing dispatch. The overall war situation stabilized on the 11th. The Chinese army in the Gan [Jiangxi] territory continued to attack Nanchang. The battle situation in Gao'an intensified. The Chinese army in Gaoyou City continued to hold firm. The strongholds near Dacheng were all under Chinese control, and the Japanese army's invasion of Xiushui made no progress. (Special dispatch, morning of the 12th)

(Chongqing) According to news received here, Chinese troops achieved a great victory on the front line in Jiangxi Province yesterday. They are counterattacking Nanchang along the eastern part of Gan [Jiangxi] Province and have approached the suburbs of Nanchang. The Japanese army is retreating towards Nanchang. The Chinese army is now stationed west of the Gan River, along the Gao'an-Fengxin line, which was recovered the day before, and is 55 kilometers from Nanchang. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 11th)

(Hong Kong) It is heard that the Japanese army has landed at Daxin Street (transliteration) on the coast of Shen Wan [Deep Bay], four miles north of British territorial waters, and then entered Nantou Town. It is reported that several places in the town are on fire. The Japanese army is now advancing towards the Shenzhen border. It is widely believed that the Japanese army wants to clear the Chinese irregular forces in the border area, so they are active near Shen Wan again. It is also said that the Japanese army had previously threatened to set fire to Nantou if the villagers of Nantou did not cooperate with them. The landing of the Japanese army at this place this time is probably to carry out their intimidation. Some timid people believe that Shenzhen is currently a place without military installations, and if the Japanese army occupies it now, the Hong Kong border will become more troublesome. However, those in charge do not think so. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Chongqing) Informed sources here say that several Chinese armies have indeed been ordered to counterattack for strategic reasons. However, the claim of a general offensive by the entire Chinese front is still not mature. At the same time, the Chinese side now anticipates that the Japanese army will make every effort to attack in order to completely occupy the Yuehan [Guangzhou-Hankou] Railway. The main Japanese force will jointly attack Changsha from the Hubei and Jiangxi provinces to occupy the northern section of the Yuehan Road, and then advance towards southern Guangdong. It is reported that the situation on the West River is tense because the Japanese army in Sanshui has advanced rapidly via a roundabout route, hoping to encircle Wuzhou. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Hong Kong) It is reported that after the Japanese army successfully landed in two places in South China this morning, Nantou has become a living hell.

Sihui. A telephone dispatch from Xinchang reports that the Chinese army on the southern route of the West River once recovered Jiangmen on the 7th, killing many enemies. However, the Japanese army then sent reinforcements from Japanese warships along the river. Due to the disparity in numbers and to avoid being cut off by the Japanese army, the Chinese army voluntarily withdrew from Jiangmen and moved to nearby □□ highlands to hold firm. In addition, the remnants of the Japanese troops surrounded near Xinhui City have recently received reinforcements and are苟延殘喘 [barely surviving], but the Chinese army is still closely monitoring the highlands north of Xinhui City and continuing to mop up. (Dispatch, 10th)

(Dispatch, 10th)

Wengyuan. After the Chinese army captured Xinjie, the Japanese army has actively sent reinforcements from the east and west for counterattacks for several days. At noon on the 9th, the Japanese army on the railway front used multiple tanks to cover a large force to invade, and used aircraft to bomb fiercely to assist in the battle. The Chinese army bravely resisted. The two sides advanced and retreated repeatedly. In the evening, a part of the Japanese army outflanked the northeast of the Chinese army, and at the same time used dense artillery fire to strike fiercely. The Chinese fortifications were completely destroyed, so they voluntarily turned to the口方 [unclear word] to advance. (Dispatch, 10th)

(Hong Kong) According to news received here, the battle situation in Jiangmen and Huicheng is still fierce, but neither side has made any significant progress.

However, this attempt has been defeated by the Chinese army. There are now no traces of the Japanese army in the Ruicheng and Pinglu areas. (Express News Agency dispatch, 11th)

### Observations by Foreign Military Experts: Japan's Adventurous Actions Against China Will Enter a Critical Juncture; Japan Relies Entirely on Motorized Equipment, and Hand-to-Hand Combat Is Far from a Match for the Chinese; If China Can Launch a Counteroffensive, It Will Not Be Difficult to Break the Japanese Advantage

(New York) Regarding the situation of the Sino-Japanese War, the New York Minsheng Tanbao (Republican faction) recently published an editorial commenting that the Japanese army's offensive in Hunan Province has apparently been frustrated. If the Chinese army launches a counteroffensive on multiple fronts, it can defeat the various lines and points occupied by the Japanese army in China. According to foreign military observers, if the Japanese army concentrates its motorized equipment to cover the advance of its infantry, it can achieve its goals. Conversely, if the Japanese army's artillery and aircraft cannot exert their powerful firepower and there are no large tanks to lead the way, then its infantry cannot effectively advance. The Japanese military authorities have already gained painful experience and deeply know that if the Japanese army engages in hand-to-hand combat with the Chinese army, then this Chinese army, whether composed of coolies or students, is no match for the Japanese army. Based on this, if the Chinese army launches a counteroffensive on more than a dozen fronts, the advantage of the Japanese army's motorized equipment will inevitably be broken by the Chinese army. Coupled with the guerrilla warfare disrupting the Japanese army's transportation lines, the Japanese dream of extracting wealth from China will inevitably be extinguished. In short, Japan's adventurous actions against China will enter a critical juncture within a few weeks, which can be asserted. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 11th)

### Chinese Army Platoon Leader Zhou Mingyi: Runs Out of Ammunition, Seriously Wounded, Heroically Sacrifices Himself; His Loyalty and Courage Are Worthy of Praise

Tongguan. Chinese Army Platoon Leader Zhou Mingyi, on the 20th of last month, led 30 soldiers to reconnoiter from Fenyang through the Lianjiashan Bottom. They discovered that over 1,000 Japanese soldiers were heading from the northwest to Fenyang. The platoon leader immediately led his team to ambush the Japanese army at the back of the Majiashan Bottom, letting the Japanese vanguard pass. When their main force approached, they used light machine guns and rifles to fiercely strafe the dense ranks of the Japanese army. The Japanese vanguard heard the sound and turned back, surrounding and attacking the platoon. The platoon was divided into three mountains, forming a mutually supporting position. Although the Japanese army was numerous and their guns and artillery fire was dense, it was ultimately difficult to approach. From dawn to dusk, the platoon leader calmly commanded and fought bravely, disregarding his own safety, fighting fiercely for 17 hours. The ammunition ran out and they were heavily besieged. The platoon leader was seriously wounded, but he still held the only remaining hand grenade in his hand. When dozens of Japanese soldiers were at the closest distance, the platoon leader pulled the pin of the hand grenade, perishing together with the Japanese army, making a heroic sacrifice. Five soldiers also died heroically, and over 20 soldiers broke through the encirclement. In this battle, over 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. The platoon leader fought against the many with the few and did not retreat until death. His spirit of loyalty, courage, righteousness, and valor is truly worthy of praise by the soldiers and civilians of the entire country. It is heard that the government will give generous rewards and condolences. (Dispatch, 10th)

### Spymaster Against China, Doihara Disfavored in Tokyo; All Plans Fail, Kita Has Replaced Him

(Tokyo) Lieutenant General Doihara has long been known as the Lawrence of Arabia because his conspiracies in China are comparable to those of Lawrence in Arabia. It is heard that although Doihara is currently still working in North China, he has fallen out of favor in Tokyo because all his plans to resolve the Sino-Japanese War have failed. Clear evidence of his disfavor in Tokyo can be seen in the appointment of Kita as the head of the liaison office of the North China Xingya Yuan [Asia Development Board]. Kita and Doihara have always had incompatible policies towards China. Now that Kita has been selected to assume the important liaison role in North China, it shows that Doihara has lost the support of senior military officials and the Japanese government in Tokyo. Another reason why Doihara is not trusted by Tokyo is said to be that he is disliked by the politicians of North China. The Japanese are now trying hard to win people's hearts, so they have appointed Kita, who has a better relationship with the politicians of North China, to carry out the liaison work. Furthermore, Doihara once launched a campaign to win over Wu Peifu, and then planned Wang Jingwei's humiliating peace, hoping that most Chinese leaders would respond to it. Unexpectedly, the results were all failures. Although the Japanese side is still planning other plans, they are no longer willing to rely on Doihara. In the past ten years, almost every Japanese conspiracy in China has had Doihara's behind-the-scenes participation. The September 18th Incident was launched by Doihara, Itagaki, and Ishihara. Subsequently, the several actions by Japan to control North China were also mostly presided over by him. Since the outbreak of the current war, Doihara has also exerted his special talents, and the recent insistence on inviting Wu Peifu to come out of retirement was one of his plans. At that time, there was a conflict with Kita, and when his plan failed, Doihara's influence was replaced by Kita. Kita's work in China is also not a one-day affair. After the Shanghai War of January 28th, Kita personally participated in the January 28th Incident. Later, he went to "Manchukuo" to work, and then served as the director of the China Department of the General Staff Headquarters. In 1936, he went to Beiping as the military attache of the Japanese Embassy in China. The establishment of the North China "Provisional Government" was mostly planned by Kita. There are currently four liaison offices set up by the Japanese in China. In addition to the one in North China, there is one in Inner Mongolia, one in Central China, and one in Xiamen. The tasks are all in the so-called "reconstruction" of China. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

### Wang Jingwei Seems to Be in Hong Kong

(Chongqing) Informed sources here do not believe the claim that Mr. Jingwei has arrived in Guangzhou, but believe that the news that Wang has arrived in Hong Kong may be more reliable. According to the Shishi Xinbao [China Times], Wang's followers Zhou Fohai, Chu Minyi, etc., have established a secret agency in Shanghai to transmit information to Wang and prepare for Wang's arrival in Shanghai.

### The Person Assassinated in Tianjin Was Cheng Xiwei

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News. Cheng Xiwei, the manager of the puppet United Reserve Bank of Tianjin and concurrently the puppet Tianjin Customs Superintendent, was assassinated at the Dagguangming Theater in the British Concession on the evening of the 9th. He was shot in a vital area and died on the spot. Cheng and his wife were watching a talkie movie. When a heated scene was playing, a brave man fired a shot, but the audience and police officers did not notice it. The assassin left calmly after the incident. Cheng was 47 years old, from Jiangsu, and was a returned student. His wife was the youngest daughter of Gao Erhu. He recently succeeded Wen Shizhen as the puppet Tianjin Customs Superintendent. After Cheng's death, Wang Kemin made a speech in Ping [Beiping], expressing a sense of "the rabbit dying, the fox grieving". (Dispatch, 11th)

Editorial

### Those Who Shake the Faith in Resistance Today

Today's China does not have alternative paths for consideration. It is absolutely unique that the entire nation is debating and deliberating between peace and war and calling it the "peace or war" question. International affairs are indeed difficult, with crises on the verge of eruption. Minute differences will ultimately lead to vast disparities. However, there is still room for assessment. If Germany and Italy feel they are riding a tiger and cannot dismount, they will wage war. If they value themselves and pull back from the precipice, they will seek peace. If England and France no longer evade responsibility, they will wage war. If they endure humiliation and swallow insults, they will seek peace. If Poland, Greece, Turkey, Romania, and others are determined to survive, they will wage war. If they are willing to become vassals, they will seek peace. Even if the Czech Republic and Albania face violence and their nations perish, should they swallow their voices and recognize the enemy as their father, that is peace. Or should they refuse to live under the same sky as the enemy, disregarding success, failure, profit, and loss, and engage in hand-to-hand combat even without a single piece of iron, that is war. Thus, in the choice between peace and war, China is vastly different. Two years ago, compromising and burying oneself in war preparations was not impossible to prolong the period of concealment and delay the outbreak of resistance. It was even possible to proclaim "peace" at the nation's gates. However, today's China is vastly different. Because there is no alternative path, there is fundamentally no such thing as a "peace or war" question. There are those who are unscrupulous and diseased. They sell out the country for personal glory, disguising their treacherous plans of surrender as a smokescreen of advocating peace. However, the eyes and ears of the world cannot be covered. They are spat upon, reviled, and condemned without the slightest hesitation. Not only is the smokescreen ineffective, but it further stimulates morale and demonstrates greater advancement. It reaffirms the national policy and demonstrates greater determination. Therefore, although the advocacy of peace continues incessantly, it does not, in fact, become a peace or war question. The newspaper has repeatedly stated these principles and hopes that readers will understand them together. However, those who come from Hong Kong claim that in the newspapers and magazines run by Jingwei, they quote out of context and misinterpret the newspaper's arguments. They even falsely accuse the Central Propaganda Department, claiming that it has a background and that its intention is to gain importance by pretense. This is extremely boring and not worth laughing at. However, the absolute nature of China having only resistance and no alternative paths should be further elaborated.

Since British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, visited Shanghai, and British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, went to Chongqing from Shanghai, rumors about Britain mediating the Sino-Japanese War have been heard from time to time. Some have already refuted this, while others are making oblique hints. For example, a certain news dispatch yesterday stated that although there is no basis for mediation, British Prime Minister Chamberlain is focusing all his attention on the Central European incident and has no time to attend to the Far Eastern disputes. Therefore, he urgently hopes that the Far Eastern war will end as soon as possible. The implication is that China's resistance should still take into account the intentions of friendly nations, and that what China expects from friendly nations has been affected by the Central European incident. As such, regardless of the original intention, it subtly suggests to people that China still has a question besides resistance. If there is a question, then resistance is not absolute. Also, those who are plotting to surrender inevitably have to admit that the demand for Japan to withdraw its troops first before negotiating peace is "well-intentioned." However, they also say that there is no such precedent in diplomatic procedures. Therefore, they advocate negotiating with Japan first, or first expressing acceptance of Japan's statement as the basis for negotiations. This proposal is nothing more than a poisoned bait, intended to entice China to abandon resistance and fall into their trap. Those who are unaware may, because of this, think that surrendering and making peace are unacceptable, but that there is indeed another path besides resistance, which can hope to make Japan withdraw its troops. If there is another path, then resistance is not absolute.

China's expectations from friendly nations are indeed inevitable and should not be concealed. In wartime, expecting to gain more benefits from friendly nations is the case for any country, not just China. However, the nature of expectation is absolutely not reliance. Reliance means that things are accomplished by others, while expectation means that things are mutually beneficial. Therefore, China's resistance does not depend on the outcome of expectations, whether there are many or few, to change course. In other words, whether resistance continues or not depends solely on whether the goals of resistance are achieved. The decision rests with China, not its friendly nations. Moreover, friendly nations are supporting China because of China's resistance, and not China resisting because it has the support of friendly nations. The order of cause and effect cannot be reversed. Therefore, international circumstances are not enough to shake the absolute nature of China's resistance. As for the Sino-Japanese War, it is due to a unilateral act of aggression, not a breakdown of diplomacy between the two countries. Therefore, to talk about diplomatic procedures and international precedents now is fundamentally wrong. How can there be any such thing? It should be known that aggression and self-defense are the two reasons for this Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, those who want to stop the war must have only two options: first, the aggressor no longer commits aggression; second, the defender no longer defends. To no longer commit aggression requires withdrawing troops. To no longer defend requires surrendering. If the troops are not withdrawn, there is only resistance. To defend, there is only resistance. China has been resisting for twenty-one months, and Japan has not yet withdrawn its troops. Therefore, to say that China can get Japan to withdraw its troops through diplomatic negotiations without defending itself is nothing but a deception. The morale of the people is the foundation of resistance, and the way to maintain it is extremely subtle. To discuss peace in the midst of resistance is not only because the Japanese troops have not withdrawn, but also because the weapons of resistance are being surrendered first in the spiritual aspect. Therefore, the only thing China can do today is to resist until Japan withdraws its troops. The negotiations and peace talks between China and Japan will take place after Japan withdraws its troops. This is another absolute procedure that cannot be shaken.

### The Twice-Robbed Pu County - Tense Atmosphere of Resistance - Large Broadswords Forged from Enemy Truck Parts, Locally Made Pistols with Long Range - Heavy Blows Will Surely Be Inflicted If the Japanese Invade Again

Somewhere in Shanxi - After leaving Heilongguan, our reporter, escorted by three cavalrymen, rode towards Pu County in southwestern Shanxi Province. This location is roughly situated between the Tongpu Railway and the Yellow River. En route, we briefly stopped for hot water and to rest our horses in a small village consisting of only three thatched huts. Only one family lived in the village and they were busy making a fire. They said that they feared the Japanese and hid in mountain caves all day. The Japanese had previously come and taken everything they owned, and burned all the doors and windows of their thatched huts, they said. We then continued on to Pu County, a neat little city nestled in a mountain valley where two rivers converge, surrounded by mountains. As we approached Pu County, the peaceful scene of the city had vanished, and charred ruins and crumbling walls were everywhere.

We entered the city from the southern outskirts. The once prosperous commercial center was now desolate and uninhabitable. All the houses had been burned down, leaving only the charred remains of beams and pillars and crumbling walls about to collapse. The city walls had been demolished by the Chinese themselves, so that when the Japanese occupied the city, the guerrillas could freely enter the city, making it difficult for the Japanese to hold. The scene inside the city was slightly better, but all the public buildings, schools, temples, and most of the houses had been destroyed. There were very few pedestrians in the streets, with only a few small shops and stalls operating as usual.

The reporter and the guide he hired stayed in a half-destroyed house. We heard that this house was originally the property of a wealthy family, but because the destroyers withdrew in a hurry at that time, a part of it was fortunately preserved. Soon, the magistrate of Pu County came to welcome us and told us about the local situation. He said that the city usually had a population of more than two thousand people, but now there are only twenty or thirty households. Since the recent arrival of the Japanese army at Heilongguan, the authorities had ordered the residents to evacuate and take all their belongings with them. Most of the people seen in the streets at the moment were those who had returned to the city in recent days after receiving news that the Japanese advance had been blocked, or who had returned from the mountains in the evening to visit their families.

The magistrate also told the reporter, "Pu County has been occupied by the Japanese army twice. The first time was in March of last year, when they burned four-fifths of the houses in the city and killed 600 residents, before being driven out by the Chinese army. When the Japanese army came again at the end of last year, there were no more houses to burn, and only sixteen residents were killed, because the people were already organized and knew how to deal with them. We pursued them in the mountains when the Japanese army withdrew, and achieved quite a few victories."

When answering the reporter's question about methods of resistance, the magistrate ordered a messenger to bring a broadsword and a pistol and said to the reporter, "This broadsword is forged from parts of the chassis of captured Japanese army trucks. At present, the entire county is equipped with this kind of weapon. We have made thousands of broadswords and a large number of farm implements for the farmers here. When the Japanese army came for the first time, we forced them to abandon more than two hundred trucks when they retreated. After we captured them, we used most of the engines to power our small-scale power plants in the mountains, and used the remaining steel parts to forge weapons and farm implements." The magistrate then showed the reporter a pistol and said, "This was made by ordinary village blacksmiths. It is completely handmade. These blacksmiths have not received any training in manufacturing firearms. The steel raw materials used are all taken from Japanese army trucks." The gun was quite crude, its shape resembling a Mauser pistol. It used 6.5 cm rifle bullets made in China or Japan. It had a straight trajectory and a simple but ingenious firing mechanism. The magistrate further told the reporter that the blacksmiths, with two assistants, could make two of these pistols a day, costing less than five yuan each. These pistols are issued to the local defense corps. Only the regular army has more sophisticated weapons. Once a bullet is fired from this pistol, the cartridge is carefully removed, and it can be reloaded and fired up to six times before it cannot be fired again. The magistrate also showed me a person who could load and fire the gun with his left fingers, as quickly as using a rifle. The reporter was a little apprehensive and fired the gun, and felt that it had quite a bit of recoil. The power of the rifle bullet was much stronger than any similar weapon, and within its range, the bullet was very accurate.

The next morning, we rode towards the Yellow River. The entire population of Pu County, about one hundred and fifty men, women, and children, walked to see us off. The magistrate told the reporter that they were overjoyed by your visit. Since the war began, you are the first outsider to come here. They feel that they have not been forgotten by the outside world.

As we set off and trudged into the mountains, the people shouted slogans such as "Resist to the End Forever" and stood and watched us until we disappeared from sight. On the way out of the city, we passed an enclosure containing the wreckage of six Japanese army trucks, part of the captured truck fleet. Our guards, who were members of the local defense corps, recounted the battles that had taken place around the city three months ago. He had participated in this battle, and happily pointed to the graves scattered on the hillside, telling how each grave contained many people. He then pointed to a grave in the distance and said that eighteen soldiers were buried in it. He then pointed to a grassland where piles of skulls and bones were gleaming white in the sun, and said that the ravines were filled with the corpses of Chinese and Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army, because we were sniping at their supply convoys and their supplies were dwindling, had to abandon the mountains surrounding the city, so we advanced and reoccupied them, and pursued the Japanese army in the mountains, and ambushed them. Today, the Japanese army is planning to invade for the third time. They may be coming, but we are familiar with the local geography and will take advantage of their unpreparedness to launch a sudden attack and cut off their communication lines, until they are forced to retreat again. What the Japanese army has done in Shanxi Province has made us determined to fight them to the end, (Reuters special correspondent, April 2)

### Wu Jingheng Writes an Article - Rebuking Wang Jingwei (2) - The "Two Wangs" Hope to Complete the Puppet Enterprise by Arbitrarily Altering Public Documents to Conceal for the Enemy

(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) A. Some people say that Wang's recent publication of "only one example" has two intentions: (1) It is what our friend heard that day when Mrs. Wang gave a "speech to comrades," she said, "To achieve our goal, we must first create a situation where the issue of peace and war can be discussed openly, at least to allow the issue of peace to be discussed as freely as the issue of war. The time has come." Therefore, Wang fired the first cannon, wanting to arouse support or refutation, making a complete mess, attempting to shake people's hearts and destroy the war of resistance, which would make the enemy laugh with joy. But Mr. and Mrs. Wang dare to commit such a treasonous crime, not only completely losing their personal integrity, but also inevitably arousing boundless public indignation. I think your propaganda, besides your colleagues Wang, Liang, and the like, where are there any Chinese people who would believe your treasonous propaganda that would shake them? It's just that you're announcing your own personal bankruptcy. As for refuting a waste of time, I know no one wants to clean a latrine with a smelly rag. I'm at the bottom of the seating, I should make the last contribution. Mr., I think you only believe the enemy and don't believe your friends. You think it's true that the enemy doesn't recognize the National Government as an opponent. You believe it's even more true that the enemy only wants you to be their negotiating partner. So you still say on the surface that you're only advising Japan to negotiate with the National Government, and you can assist from the sidelines as a private citizen. These polite words, I ask you, if you don't collude with the enemy, what qualifications do you have to say that you can go to the enemy country to negotiate with your own government? I believe you're still dreaming this dream hasn't woken up yet, you still think that the enemy only recognizes you as an opponent is true and not deceiving you. So you're still calm and generous, very polite and humble, wanting to advise the enemy country to negotiate with the National Government. But you ask yourself what's in your gourd, what medicine are you selling? Honestly, without being polite, let me expose your trick. Your intention is that when the time is right, you will politely come out and say, now the country has been messed up by you irresponsible, insincere, and ignorant slaves. You should quickly get out of the way and let me do it. On the one hand, you put on a pose of compassion and say, "Since Japan doesn't want the National Government to be their opponent, and the National Government is too embarrassed to ask Japan for peace, then in the end only I, Jingwei, can reluctantly come out to save the country, to be Japan's opponent." Under Konoe's so-called "New Order in East Asia," the "Two Wangs" will jointly complete the great undertaking of the "cooperative body" of Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. Isn't that your plan? This isn't my friend talking nonsense, it's not me joking. Your statement on the ninth, regarding the news published by the Ta Kung Pao on the fifth, that you're colluding with the enemy and selling out the country, acting as a pawn for the Party, and leading the wolf into the house, you still want to defend yourself and refuse to admit it. But the materials and evidence I have are more detailed and accurate than what the Ta Kung Pao published. If a lawsuit is filed, I will have to bring real evidence to the court to prove it. By then, you will have nothing to say, right?

(2) It is to reveal the minutes of the National Defense Council, to make the Wang faction in Hong Kong and other places spread a rumor that "Wang's telegram on the 29th is a duet with the government," with evidence disclosed, just to make people know that the Nanjing meeting and Wang's telegram on the 29th have no causal relationship. It only shows that Wang himself is a person who is uncertain about peace and war, who is fickle. Moreover, in terms of duet, Wang wears a small hat askew, with a face smeared with white powder, performing with hands and feet on the stage, Konoe singing loudly behind his buttocks "New Order," Wang's hands and feet should be combined with the melody, as if it came from his mouth, suddenly Mr. Chiang behind him bitterly rebuking the "New Order," Wang would be stunned on the stage, his hands and feet stiff and motionless. This can be judged by the little brother who is watching the duet, who is Wang performing the duet with? The little brother will shout loudly, what I see on the stage is called "Two Wangs Duet," a joint performance by China and Japan. This is a small problem, I advise the big man Wang not to pay attention to it, if he commits the crime of leaking confidential documents, to be dragged into another amusing story, it is even more not worth it.

(B) Leaking confidential documents under one's own duties and positions is already enough to be a crime, and arbitrarily adding and altering public documents to suit one's own intentions is not what a leader of the masses should do. For example, in Wang's article, it is cited that the German ambassador met with Minister Wang again, claiming that the German ambassador to Japan had spoken with the Japanese Army and Foreign Ministers in Tokyo, inquiring whether Japan wanted to end the current situation, "and it was heard that the Japanese government, if it wanted to end the current situation, under what conditions could it be ended," This is not in the record, but it is to conceal for the enemy the extent to which the enemy wants the German government to mediate peace, so as not to provoke the enemy country's resentment. Also, regarding the question of yesterday, "Detailed methods are technical problems," the record also does not have this. Also, the record of the talks between Tang Mengxiao, Bai Jiansheng, Xu Cichen, Gu Mosan, etc., also does not have this. Also, Ambassador Tao said, "China's resistance to Japan has shown the spirit of resistance, and now it is time to end it. During the European War, there were several good opportunities to seek peace, but in the end we were confident in our own strength and refused to negotiate peace, until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, when we were forced to accept whatever conditions were put forward ×××, in his view, Japan's conditions are not harsh," the record does not have a single word of this. This is what should be stated for the German Ambassador Tao, so as to avoid Ambassador Tao being condemned by his government in Germany and losing our Chinese diplomatic credibility. There are many such small alterations, although they are all of no great importance, they are only suitable for enticing people with the idea of peace. However, for a central figure to be able to forge so freely, even if it is really careless, blinded by greed, to become a puppet, you are so unfaithful to your duties, wouldn't even the little devils be afraid of you, so they dare not take your life? You have to be careful, I think that at the right time, you will definitely have a Gu Rugeng-style ending. Moreover, now you and your wife want to gather "comrades" and cause a small disturbance, how can you control your subordinates, it's all just selling fakes. Su Xiwu was plotted against by his guards, I hope Wang takes care of himself. (To be continued)

### General Pétain Returns to His Country to Report on His Duties - British Ambassador Meets with Spanish Foreign Minister

(Paris) The French ambassador to Spain, General Pétain, returned to Paris today and immediately met with Foreign Minister Bonnet to report on his duties. Political figures believe that Pétain's return to the country is related to the fact that the Italian volunteers in Spain have not yet been completely withdrawn. They also said that the French government is deeply displeased with the Franco government's declaration. The Italian army has already forcibly occupied Albania, and the Italian troops stationed in Spain are still unwilling to withdraw. As a result, Italy's position in the Mediterranean will be greatly enhanced. Therefore, Britain and France are about to send an ultimatum to Franco. However, before sending the ultimatum, they plan to send Ambassador Pétain to Franco again to explain the advantages and disadvantages and persuade him to turn back early. If Franco can pull back from the brink, the overall situation can be turned from danger to safety. (Haitong Telegram on the 10th)

### Mediterranean Interests Threatened - Britain and France Issue Serious Warnings to Italy - If the Territory of Greece and Turkey is Invaded, They Will Not Hesitate to Use Force at the Expense of Sacrifice

(London) The British Parliament notified Italy yesterday that if Italy further disturbs the European situation with military action, the British government will take a stern attitude. This warning was delivered to the Italian side in Rome and Britain. The article particularly emphasizes Greece and Turkey, which further shows the British side's formal guarantee of the territorial integrity of Greece and Turkey. (Associated Press Telegram on the 11th)

(Paris) According to diplomatic sources, British Ambassador to Italy, Percy Loraine, has submitted a joint British-French warning to Mussolini, asking him not to make any further territorial expansions. If the status quo of the Mediterranean is further threatened, Britain and France will inevitably use force. At the same time, last night, the French Prime Minister and the French Foreign Minister also had continuous long-distance telephone calls with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Minister Halifax. Regarding whether the Soviet Union can come out to assist the Balkan countries in the event of a European war, French Foreign Minister Bonnet also discussed with the Soviet Ambassador to France. According to diplomatic observations, if Italy does not take any further action after swallowing Albania, Britain and France will not take strong action for a while. However, if Italy is greedy, the situation will inevitably take a sharp turn for the worse. The current efforts of Britain and France are to obtain the consent of Greece, so that Corfu Island can be used as a joint naval base for Britain and France. The intention of Britain is not to openly occupy the island, but only to use it temporarily in the form of a treaty. According to the fact that Greece had already allowed the island to be used by Britain during the autumn when Anglo-Italian relations were extremely bad during Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, it is of course easier to obtain its permission this time. Once this decision is established, Britain can prevent Italy from seizing the island and form assistance to Greece when it is invaded. Britain's policy is to cooperate closely with France, the Soviet Union, and the Balkan countries to maintain the strategic balance in the Adriatic Sea. Britain and France now feel that no matter what Romania's attitude is, the Soviet Union and Turkey must have sufficient power to control the Black Sea and the Dardanelles Strait. Furthermore, although Greece, like Romania and Poland, is unwilling to cooperate militarily with the Soviet Union, if Italy assists Bulgaria in acquiring an outlet to the Aegean Sea, it will definitely encourage the military assistance of the Soviet Union. According to observations here, after Britain warned Italy not to have any ambitions towards Greece, Italy may turn to Yugoslavia for development. If Yugoslavia does not join Britain's "defense system" at that time, it will inevitably be preyed upon by Italy. (Associated Press Telegram on the 11th)

(London) According to today's report, British and French warships are now concentrating at the entrance of the Adriatic Sea. At the same time, British Prime Minister Chamberlain is now making a final effort to negotiate conditions with Mussolini through diplomatic means. If Italy can guarantee that it will not attack Greece and agree to immediately begin withdrawing Italian troops from Spain, then the fact that Italy occupies Albania can be recognized. Political observers believe that if this kind of agreement is impossible, then Chamberlain will declare in the House of Commons on Thursday that the British government is prepared to establish a defensive alliance with Greece and Turkey and will announce the abolition of the Anglo-Italian Friendship Agreement that maintains the status quo in the Mediterranean. The Admiralty refused to release information about the movements of British warships. The plans of Britain and France are clearly for the sake of their Mediterranean interests. It is heard that the two countries are not paying attention to Yugoslavia and are leaving their fate to heaven. At present, Germany and Italy are exerting pressure on Yugoslavia, and after Italy occupied Albania, it has made it impossible for Britain and France to help Yugoslavia except through Romania. Therefore, Britain and France made this decision. Another reason is that Yugoslavia failed to achieve internal unity by resolving the Croatian ethnic issue. It is heard that Britain and France are still in negotiations with Romania. It is heard that the Soviet Union is still expressing doubts about whether Britain really wants to unite the anti-aggression group to stop future aggression. (Associated Press Telegram on the 11th)

### The British Government Decides - To Guarantee the Security of the Balkan Countries - Parliament Will Reopen Tomorrow and Issue Important Declarations - Britain and France Maintain Close Diplomatic and Military Cooperation

(London) According to official sources, Parliament is scheduled to reconvene on the 11th of this month. At that time, Prime Minister Chamberlain will make an extremely important declaration in the House of Commons, stating that Britain is determined to guarantee the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Greece, Turkey, and Romania. At the same time, Foreign Minister Halifax will also make the same declaration in the House of Lords. The Cabinet has just decided on the outline of the declaration at a small group meeting held at 4:00 pm today. Cabinet meetings will also be convened in the next two days to continue discussions in order to create a final draft. According to well-informed sources, the Prime Minister will explain in this declaration to what extent Britain is prepared to accept constraints in order to maintain the status quo in the Balkan Peninsula. (Havas Telegram on the 10th)

(London) Well-informed sources here recently announced that since Italy's invasion of Albania, the British government has intended to provide guarantees to Greece. Up until today, it has also decided to simultaneously guarantee the security of Romania and Turkey. There are three reasons for this: (1) As of today, it is necessary to take immediate action to prevent other parts of Europe from being invaded. (2) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has already provided assurances, stating that he will not threaten Greece. If Britain only provides guarantees to Greece, it will be suspected of criticizing Italy. It is also possible that Italy may take action against Yugoslavia. (3) After Britain provides guarantees to the Balkan countries, it can put moderate pressure on Bulgaria to urge it to join the collective security organization. In short, Britain will provide unilateral guarantees to the Balkan countries. This is the same as the guarantees given to Poland before the agreement was reached between Britain and Poland. Afterwards, the "mutual guarantee" agreement will still be negotiated with each country through diplomatic channels. (Havas Telegram on the 10th)

(London) The Cabinet Subcommittee is scheduled to discuss foreign policy issues at the Prime Minister's residence this afternoon. Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Minister Halifax, and Air Minister Sir Kingsley Wood have made preparations in the morning and consulted on the declaration that the Prime Minister should issue when Parliament reconvenes on the 13th of this month. What is the content of this declaration? It is said that it will depend on Italy's intentions towards Spain. In other words, whether the guarantees provided by Italy to Britain on this issue are reliable will depend on whether Italy can withdraw its volunteers. It will even depend on whether Italy's invasion of Albania is the starting point for large-scale actions in the Mediterranean. The British government, on the one hand, instructed Ambassador Percy Loraine to Italy to make inquiries to the Italian government, and on the other hand, ordered Ambassador Peterson to Spain to negotiate with the Nationalist government, and hopes that each ambassador can submit a report before the Prime Minister issues a declaration on the 13th of this month. According to well-informed sources, Prime Minister Chamberlain believes that if Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is transferred to be the Governor of Albania, and is succeeded by the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Count Grandi, then it is not completely hopeless for Britain and Italy to improve their relations. Outside observers are paying close attention to Italy's large-scale mobilization of reserve soldiers. According to estimates from some sources, the number of mobilized people is no less than one or two million. Moreover, after Poland mobilized a part of its troops, it has not yet demobilized, which shows that the tense relations between Germany and Poland remain the same. Even the Netherlands is taking preventive measures in the military. The anxiety of European countries can be seen from this. However, members of Parliament here still declare that the British government has decided on a plan to deal with all events and has taken preventive measures in vulnerable areas of the British Empire to be on guard. However, this measure is absolutely secret and cannot be known to the outside world. (Havas Telegram on the 11th)

(Paris) Responsible officials here recently declared that regarding the incident in Albania, Britain and France have completely consistent views and actions. This can be clearly demonstrated by the parallel measures taken by both sides in diplomacy and military affairs. The French Cabinet was originally scheduled to convene a meeting on the 12th of this month, but it has been brought forward to 4:00 pm tomorrow. At that time, Foreign Minister Bonnet will submit a detailed report, explaining the international situation and the talks between Britain and France, as well as the talks with Eastern European countries. Prime Minister Daladier will explain the progress of yesterday's meeting of the Standing Committee on National Defense. As far as the general public knows, the committee has considered and even made some decisions on the measures to be taken in the event of unexpected events. In addition, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives is scheduled to meet on the 12th of this month. The chairman of the committee, Mistralet, will deliver a speech at that time, explaining the position adopted by the French government in the current international situation. The Council of State is scheduled to hold a regular meeting on the 12th to approve the decisions made by the Cabinet meeting tomorrow. (Havas Telegram on the 10th)

Yugoslavia, given its unfavorable geographical position, believes that it should obtain the assistance of Britain and France. Also, 700 Albanians have volunteered to fight against the Italian army. Most of them are former officials who served in King Zog's government and fled to Yugoslavia. (Associated Press, 11th)

Capital of Yugoslavia. While the government continues to maintain a silent attitude, public sentiment has suddenly turned to hatred of Italy. Small-scale anti-Italian demonstrations took place in Belgrade and Skopje during the holidays.

(Haitong, 11th)

Istanbul. Local newspapers, which previously rarely expressed criticism of the international situation, are now showing signs of panic.

### Netherlands Determined to Maintain Neutrality; Defensive Measures Taken at Border

Amsterdam. Dutch Prime Minister Colijn delivered a broadcast speech today, expressing the Netherlands' determination to maintain neutrality at all costs, pointing out that this is the sole reason why military plans were implemented on the Dutch border yesterday, and declaring that there is absolutely no reason for anxiety or unease. Colijn's wording was very solemn and cautious, saying that the special plans implemented at the border should not be seen as implying that the country is under any direct threat, and stressing that the country's foreign relations are consistently friendly. However, in view of the general situation in Europe, as a precautionary measure and to reassure the public, measures have been taken at the border. What the Netherlands wants to express is that the Netherlands is determined to maintain its independence and neutrality in all circumstances and towards all parties. There is no reason to believe that the government fears a direct threat. The special plans that have been implemented will continue to be maintained until the situation returns to calm. At the same time, Colijn urged the people of the country to go about their business with peace of mind. (Reuters, 11th)

### Italy Calls Up Reservists; Army Exceeds One Million; Claims Italy Will Advance into Salonika if Britain Occupies the Dodecanese Islands

(Rome) Since January of this year, the Italian government has been calling up reservists from the classes of 1901 to 1914 in batches. As of now, its army strength is said to have exceeded one million. However, according to some sources, the reservists of the 1912 and 1914 classes were recently called up to replace the troops stationed in Italian Libya in North Africa. (Havas, 10th)

(Rome) It is reported that reservists of all classes were drafted today to supplement the troops sent to Albania, most of whom are from the 1912 class. It is said that the term of enlistment will not be long. The total number, according to official announcements, is 200,000. After news of Britain's decision on the Albanian issue, which will be decided by Parliament, reached here, all political circles in Italy hope that Britain will not take any action against Italy that is stronger than issuing diplomatic notes. At the same time, Italy is now jealous of the comments made by various parties regarding the Dodecanese Islands of Greece. Some circles claim that if British troops occupy the Dodecanese Islands to resist Italy, Italy will advance into Salonika. (Reuters, 10th)

### Axis Powers Expanding Influence; President Roosevelt Deeply Concerned About European Situation; Anticipates Outbreak of War in Europe This Autumn; Plans to Promote Revision of Neutrality Act to Effectively Assist Democratic Countries

(Washington) President Roosevelt returned here yesterday from Warm Springs and is extremely worried about European events. Upon arrival, the President met with Secretary of State Hull and is expected to consult again today, at which time Hull will submit a report on European developments. (Associated Press, 11th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt returned to the capital yesterday from Warm Springs. When he left, he told his neighbors that if war does not break out in Europe, he will return to this place in the fall of this year. Observers here commented that the White House and the State Department are pessimistic about the European situation, as can be seen from the President's remarks. Secretary of State Hull also said that after a large amount of funds from European countries flows into the United States, the purchasing power of those countries may decrease. The intention is to inform the people that if the European situation continues to be turbulent, the US economy will be greatly affected and cannot be ignored. In addition, political figures also said that the reason why the US authorities are sparing no effort to discuss the serious situation in Europe is due to three ideas: (1) The plan of the Berlin-Rome Axis to divide spheres of influence in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean is being rapidly implemented. Britain and France want to form a security line to contain it. Judging from the evolution of the situation, the two sides will soon clash, outside of foreign policy. (2) The US authorities have decided to suggest to Congress and public opinion that the government's attitude is indeed correct and that its decision to support Britain and France is also beneficial. (3) The current Neutrality Act Amendment will be submitted to Congress for discussion in a short period of time. The government urgently wants to exert influence on members of Congress as much as possible so that the Neutrality Act can be amended according to the government's views, and the United States can provide effective assistance to Britain and France in peacetime and wartime. According to some sources, if the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees do not make rapid progress in reviewing the Neutrality Act Amendment, President Roosevelt may personally attend to inform them that the European situation is so serious that it is not appropriate to delay the decision any longer.

### US Plans to Add Naval Air Bases in Two Oceans; Senate Naval Committee Passes Amendment; Plan to Fortify Guam Vetoed

In addition to eliminating the clause in the original bill to build an airfield on Guam, the total budget was reduced from $52,000,000 to $47,000,000. It was then submitted to the Senate Naval Committee for discussion. The committee recently passed an amendment today, proposing to add $18,000,000 to the budget already approved by the House, with $17,000,000 to add a naval air base at Jacksonville, Florida, and the remaining $1,000,000 to purchase land at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, in the Atlantic, for the purpose of establishing a naval air base. The clause to build an airfield on Guam has also been vetoed. (Havas, 10th)

### US Plans to Stockpile Wartime Raw Materials; Cotton and Wheat Supplied to Britain, Netherlands, and Belgium in Exchange for Rubber and Tin

(Washington) Democratic Senator Byrnes advocates a great international raw material exchange plan that has the dual effect of creating the war power of democratic countries and eliminating America's surplus agricultural products. Byrnes suggested that the United States should exchange cotton and wheat with Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries for rubber and tin. Government officials and powerful groups in the Senate are quite supportive of the plan. The State Department and the Department of Agriculture also expressed sympathy. According to Byrnes, the State Department will propose large-scale transactions to foreign governments within a few days. The Department of the Army and the Department of the Navy now want to reserve at least 226,000 tons of rubber, or 250,000 tons for adequate use, and propose to reserve $65 million worth of tin ingots. According to this plan, raw materials will be stockpiled, and the countries that obtain them cannot sell them within five years unless the price has exceeded the stipulated figure. Byrnes estimates that the 11 million bales of borrowed cotton stored by the government can be sold for at least 2 million bales if handled according to his plan. (Reuters, 10th)

Hiranuma finally pointed out that Japan has no intention of interfering with the rights and interests of third countries in the Far East, "but only to the extent that it does not endanger Japan's national defense and interests."

### Japanese Government Supervises Industrial Institutions; Assigns Officials as Directors, Subject to Severe Criticism by Parliament

(Tokyo) The government's practice of assigning former officials to serve as directors of official auxiliary companies has been severely criticized by the Diet. Various political parties have lodged strong protests against this move by the government. Many officials are appointed as senior personnel in state-run companies immediately after resigning. This trend has become more prevalent since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and the number of opponents has increased. The prominent financial newspaper Chugai Commercial News stated that there is no doubt that this approach has various drawbacks. When the various political parties initially expressed their opposition, the government replied that this move was necessary to implement government supervision. We are not clear about this attitude. The government can issue regulations to fulfill its responsibilities of ensuring and supervising, without having to appoint officials as directors of various companies. (Reuters, 10th)

### Albania Loses Independence; US Considers Recalling Ambassador

(Washington) Regarding the Italian invasion of Albania, the US government has not expressed any intention to protest to Italy. Those in the know say that the US government may consider this and recall the US Ambassador to Albania, Mr. Grant, because the Provisional Administrative Committee of Albania has pledged allegiance to the Italian government, and the country no longer has independent sovereignty. (Havas, 10th)

### Aggressor Nation Condemned; Conscience Pierced

(Washington) The abusive attacks by Italian newspapers on the US government are well-received by those in the know. They claim that these attacks are sufficient to show that President Roosevelt's strong policy has had the effect of piercing the conscience of the aggressor. The US government was the first in the world to condemn the conquest of Czechoslovakia and Albania, and will continue to condemn any act of aggression thereafter. (Reuters, 10th)

### The Soviet Union Resets Its Policy: Reliance on Nationalism —Not Relying on Agreements—

— Specially Written

Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, France, these two major countries had formed a mutual assistance pact, believing they had a mountain to rely on. Who knew that when danger arrived, these two allies would stand idly by, watching her be slaughtered and occupied. If there hadn't been a mutual assistance pact, without consulting others, she might have put up a valiant resistance against the enemy. Although she still couldn't have avoided destruction, she could have had a swift and decisive end. But as it was, she could neither be a shattered jade nor a broken tile, and "alas" she died in a confused and unclear way. France and the Soviet Union naturally cannot escape their blame, and those who signed the Munich Agreement are truly the chief culprits. However, when that agreement was made, many people praised Chamberlain for averting a great disaster and for his hard work and great achievements, saying that selfish people, as long as they could preserve their own lives and property, what did sacrificing a Czechoslovakia matter? How could they feel any pain? I, however, had already overthrown the peacemaking old man who called himself the "Hundred Tolerances." But heaven does not protect the wicked, and those who commit evil will surely reap the consequences. Hitler's ambition was insatiable, seeking more after acquiring something. After annexing Czechoslovakia, he extended his greedy tongue to Poland and Romania. As a result, Chamberlain also felt that the flames of Nazism were about to burn his own eyebrows. Fearing that Poland and Romania would become "Czechoslovakia the Second," "Czechoslovakia the Third," and then one or two more "Czechoslovakia the Fourth" and "Czechoslovakia the Fifth," and that Britain might become "Czechoslovakia the Sixth," he stopped being the "Hundred Tolerances" Zhang Gong and boldly announced, "From now on, I will resist German aggression." On the one hand, he hurriedly guaranteed the security of Poland and Romania, and on the other hand, he took advantage of Polish Foreign Minister Beck's visit to London to conclude the "Anglo-Polish Mutual Assistance Pact." It is true that Chamberlain has changed his policy, but who dares to guarantee that this agreement will not end up with the same results as the "Franco-Czech Pact," the "Soviet-Czech Pact," and the "Munich Agreement"? Thus, the gentlemen who flattered Chamberlain again praised, "Old Mr. Zhang has made a great determination this time, which can be called a new era in history." Isn't it too early to say that! Just seeing British Secretary of the Navy Earl Stanhope say a few boastful words, Chamberlain became panicked. On the one hand, he asked the newspapers not to publish them, and on the other hand, he declared in the House of Commons that these words were not directed at any country. Furthermore, he has not yet invited the Soviet Union, a country capable of strongly resisting aggression, to join the collective security system because of Poland's opposition. This clearly shows that Chamberlain is still hesitant and cannot fully implement his new policy. Now that Italy has conquered Albania, Britain feels even more acute pain. Whether Chamberlain has the great determination to resist aggression will be seen in the next few days. A few months ago, the London National Magazine said, "Great Britain has decided that she must remain a great power and a protector of fairness, freedom, and justice, and that it is time to fall and become a vehicle for an omnipotent nation." How much more so now? However, even today, can Britain still call itself the protector of fairness, freedom, and justice for the surviving people of Czechoslovakia? Now, turning to the Soviet Union, its attitude towards the Western democratic countries is neither close nor distant. It is a powerful force among the democratic countries. British Eden, Lloyd George, and the Labor Party, and American Stimson, among others, all advocate, "To vigorously resist aggressive countries, we must unite with the Soviet Union." The actions of the Soviet Union are what everyone is paying attention to today. Mr. Chelton, a correspondent for the British Daily Telegraph and the Morning Post stationed in Moscow, had a letter mentioning the impact of the Munich Agreement on the Soviet Union and the new policies it has adopted as a result. I am translating it below. I think those who care about the European situation will definitely want to read it.

On the twenty-first anniversary of the founding of the Red Army (February 23), all members of the Red Army, from generals to recruits, had to read a new oath, which was very different from the "Red Oath" of the Lenin era of international class warfare. This time, the oath no longer contains words such as "Children of the working class, wholeheartedly and wholeheartedly strive to achieve the goal of liberating all workers in order to uphold socialism," but only the words "Soviet citizens are willing to step forward to defend their motherland," which is essentially the same as the oaths of any other national defense force. Under the strict guidance of Stalin, the tendency of Soviet Bolshevism towards "nationalization" has never been as widespread as this registration oath.

Some say that the Soviet Union's intervention in the Spanish Civil War shows the hypocrisy of the new oath, but that is not the case. Although the Soviet Union did command the air war of the Spanish Republican Army in 1937, it only lasted for one or two months and was strictly kept secret (Soviet newspapers never admitted that the Soviet Union had sent a single soldier to Spain). In addition, it was too late, and the assistance was only in the form of materials, military advisors, tanks, air force personnel, and anti-aircraft gunners, totaling just over 1,200 people.

### The Impact of the Munich Agreement

Regardless of what the Third International did before, since the real outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the Soviet Union's policy has been to encourage the "People's Front" of moderate elements within the Republican Army to resist the extremists. The Communist Party previously used destructive tactics to contain the German left wing, which greatly helped Hitler seize power. Moscow has greatly learned from this bitter lesson. This is partly due to Soviet idealism, but the Soviet Union's decision to take action in Spain was largely based on a defensive "power politics" attempt to make France take on large-scale intervention obligations in Spain and to strengthen the "People's Front" government then in power. She believed that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact would thus increase in strength. The Soviet Union joined the League of Nations because of its compliance with this pact. The Soviet Union, like Germany, always kept Czechoslovakia in its heart. Czechoslovakia was connected to France and the Slavic powers, which were then in a defensive position in Western Europe. The Munich Agreement tore up the Soviet-Czech Pact, and thus the Franco-Soviet Pact also became a dead letter, thus ruining the last hope that people often held: Soviet participation in the Spanish Civil War.

The crisis in September occurred when the Soviet Union was undergoing a transformation, and the Soviet Union was quite embarrassed at the time. Stalin's purge of the army and internal affairs originally hoped to eventually achieve the goal of strengthening "nationalization," so it had to be temporarily relaxed. Stalin's original intention was to sacrifice at least 75% of officers above the rank of colonel. (To be continued)

### Tense Situation Suddenly Appears in Changzhou, Residents Flee to the Countryside

Changzhou Correspondence: After the mobile troops of the Chinese army suddenly became active in the Eastern Theater, Wujin County, along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, and Yixing and Qiaoxi on the Wuyi Highway were advanced by the Chinese army, and a great chaos occurred in Yicheng under Japanese and puppet control. Residents in Wuyi City, affected by this, also packed their goods and fled to the countryside. Some even stopped loading goods ordered from Shanghai. Lai Ti, the puppet county magistrate, and Aijia, the head of the Japanese special service team, went to the outside of the West Gate the day before yesterday to explain to the shops with sweet words, hoping to cover up the situation, but the order of the residents was still chaotic.

### Wuxi Rice Merchants Plan to Transport Rice, Japanese and Puppet Restrictions Lead to Stagnant Market

Wuxi Correspondence: Rice and silk cocoons are the main businesses in Wuxi. However, silk cocoon production directly benefits farmers. It is hoped that the output will be abundant and the cocoon price will be high, which will greatly benefit the rural economy. The rice industry, however, cannot meet the food needs of the county's residents with the county's production alone. The prosperity of the rice market depends entirely on the large-scale transportation of rice from various rice-producing areas to Wuxi. Rice merchants from various places come to Wuxi to purchase rice, the source is abundant, and the sales are very smooth, so rice merchants can make profits and indirectly prosper other industries, which is beneficial to the entire social economy. Since the outbreak of the war, transportation in various inland counties has been blocked, and the transportation of goods has been unsmooth. The daily necessities of the people are becoming more expensive due to the lack of sources. The rice grain, which is related to the food problem of the people, is also becoming scarcer and the inventory is low, and it is even more controlled by the Japanese and puppets. Rice merchants from Shanghai come to Wuxi to purchase rice continuously, and the rice price has risen from about ten yuan to thirteen or fourteen yuan. After the puppet government banned exports, the rice price fell by more than two yuan. Now the source is abundant, and rice and paddy rice stored in various rice mills and warehouses have reached more than 300,000 dans. The rice industry has been banned from transportation for half a month. Rice mills and rice shops have no business to operate, and they have stopped their machines one after another. More than 10,000 workers have suddenly lost their livelihoods. If rice grain is strictly prohibited from being moved out for a long time, it will be no different from a dead market. Rice merchants who came to Wuxi to sell rice left for other places because there was no way to sell it. In a blink of an eye, wheat will be on the market, and there will be no need to worry about the food of the people. Rice merchants have been quite anxious since the puppet government issued the ban on transportation. They held a meeting the day before yesterday to find a way to relax the ban on grain transportation, but the Japanese and puppets have not yet approved it. They need to discuss solutions in the short term and make a decision.

### Japanese Troops Stationed in Hangzhou Forcibly Recruit Refugees into Military Service, the Old, Weak, Women and Children are Also Forced to Work

Hangzhou Correspondence: The special service agency of the Japanese army in Hangzhou set up a refugee shelter in Jingsi Temple in the West Lake in August last year under the pretext of providing relief to refugees. It detained homeless men, women, old, and young refugees and forced the refugees to work for the Japanese army. The refugees had no choice but to endure it temporarily due to the environment. However, recently, the Japanese army lured young and strong teenagers in the shelter to the suburbs under the pretext of helping with work, organized them into troops, and trained them in order to supplement the quotas of the original teams. However, most of the strong men expressed their unwillingness, so three of them tried to escape by taking advantage of the opportunity. In the end, they were caught in the middle of the way due to the strict precautions of the Japanese and died tragically. Since then, the Japanese army has tied up the batch of strong men with ropes every night for transportation. In addition, there are old and weak refugees in the shelter. Except for young children who were transported to Japan, more than 130 other women and children have been forced to work at the "Huazhong Silk Company" and the "Sanyou Industrial Society" and "Guanghua Match Company" in Gongbu.

### Ministry of Education Prepares to Change Secondary School Curriculum, Convening Education Commissioners and Experts for Discussion

(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) After the Third National Education Conference, the Ministry of Education convened a discussion meeting on secondary school curriculum standards. More than 20 education commissioners and experts from education departments across the country, including Huang Yanpei, Zhou Shang, Jiang Wenyu, Zhong Daozan, and Zeng Kezhong, were hosted by Gu Juechang Yuxiu and Gu Sizhang Shusen of the Ministry of Education. The discussion lasted all day, and the results are as follows: (1) The total number of teaching hours per week for each subject in secondary school shall not exceed 30 hours. This total number of hours is determined and regulated based on the analysis and distribution of students' healthy lives. (2) In the junior high school curriculum, the changes to be made include increasing the number of hours for hygiene, changing "plants and animals" to "biology," and changing "English" to "foreign language," while inland areas may appropriately change to teaching vocational subjects according to local needs. (3) There are no major changes to the senior high school curriculum. The main changes are (A) increasing hygiene, (B) reducing Chinese language class hours, (C) reducing mathematics class hours, (D) reducing English class hours, (E) reducing modern history class hours, (F) increasing domestic history and geography and reducing foreign history and geography. (4) The curriculum for a six-year integrated secondary school will be drafted by the Ministry and then seek opinions from all parties. This discussion of the secondary school curriculum is entirely the basis for modifying the curriculum when the curriculum committee is organized in the future, so it is extremely important. However, the implementation date must wait until three years later. It takes time to formulate new standards, develop teaching material outlines, and edit textbooks. It is not until the textbooks and other materials have been edited and written that they can be promulgated and adopted.

### Guangxi Provincial Government Implements Cave Education in Guilin, Currently There are Eighteen Large Cave Schools

(Guilin Correspondence) The Guangxi Provincial Government recently accepted Mr. Tao Xingzhi's suggestion to use a cave in Guilin to implement cave education, which can be unaffected by Japanese bombing. This is a major initiative in the history of education. The details are recorded as follows:

Cave Education: Guilin is surrounded by mountains on all sides outside the city, with towering peaks and numerous caves, hence the saying "Guilin's landscape is the best in the world." Since the War of Resistance, Japanese planes have often bombed the area, and schools have been unable to hold classes in the morning, and libraries have also stopped lending books. Caves are the best natural air-raid shelters, so after Mr. Tao Xingzhi returned to China, he suggested to the provincial government to implement cave education measures, making each large cave a wartime public school and each small cave a classroom. The Guangxi Provincial Government originally designated 1939 as the year of adult education, planning to have all 13 million Guilin residents fully receive education on resistance against Japan. Therefore, it immediately adopted Tao's suggestion and implemented cave education, making cave education a suitable venue for implementing adult education, which is a major initiative in the history of education.

Wartime Public Schools: There are eighteen large caves in Guilin, including Kanniu Cave, Jiaohua Cave, Mulong Small Cave, Duihua Cliff, Old Man Mountain, Guo Jiahou Rock, Liu Ma Mountain, Jiugangguan, Cenggong Cliff, Huanzhu Cave, Seven Star Cave, Seven Star Hou Cave, Longyin Cave, Laojun Cave, Elephant Trunk Hill, Yashui Rock, Guniu Mountain, and Bailong Cave. Among them, the Seven Star Cave is the largest, reaching one mile in depth and capable of holding 20,000 people. It has now been transformed into a wartime public school, with teachers and students from Hanmin Middle School, which moved from Beijing, Jiangsu Education Institute, which moved from Wuxi, and the China Vocational Education Society, which moved from Shanghai, as well as the Propaganda Assault Team of the Military Commission, the Xin'an Traveling Troupe, the Children's Theater Troupe, and film projection teams serving as teachers.

Educational Content: The educational content in the caves includes six items: drama, singing, life guidance, current affairs reports, knowledge of war, and stories of resistance against Japan. In addition, there are radio broadcasts and film screenings. In the radio broadcasts, one can listen to reports from the air defense headquarters on the movements of Japanese aircraft and disaster conditions. The screening of films, especially realistic films of the battlefield, can greatly increase the spirit of resistance against Japan. In the mountain depressions next to the caves, there are salvation libraries and reading rooms for the public to read. War maps, comic strips, and photographs are hung on the stone walls, which are quite stimulating.

Full Text of Resolutions of the Third National Education Conference (6) Proposal for Improving Secondary Education (Part 1) (Special Correspondent Yi Sheng from Chongqing Airmail)

The resolution on improving secondary education passed by the National Education Conference is as follows:

Secondary education is originally a preparation for students to enter higher education and is the most important stage in the entire education system. The main points of this plan are (1) creating a six-year secondary school to improve the level of secondary education, (2) revising the teaching curriculum to adapt to modern needs, (3) emphasizing production labor training to develop habits of using both hands and mind, (4) vigorously implementing vocational guidance to examine youth's personalities and indicate pathways for further education and employment. The methods are as follows:

(1) The secondary school system and goals should be changed appropriately

1. In addition to the original three-three system of secondary schools, a six-year integrated secondary school should be established, without distinguishing between junior and senior high school. 2. (1) A six-year integrated secondary school will be implemented in a portion of schools in several provinces and cities designated by the Ministry of Education for experimentation. (2) A portion of the curriculum in the third grade of junior high school should be divided and implemented separately to facilitate students to study for further education or employment. English may be optional in the third school year. 3. One year may be added on top of the three years of junior high school, with a simple vocational course attached. 4. Senior and junior high schools prepare students for further education and also cultivate middle and junior-level talents for general social undertakings.

(2) Divide secondary school districts to determine the establishment of secondary schools (see proposals in the education administration category)

1. Each province should consider the transportation, population, economy, culture, and distribution of existing schools in various places to divide the entire province into several secondary school districts. 2. The number of secondary schools in each secondary school district in the province should be appropriately distributed. Each district should have at least one secondary school. 3. Junior high schools should be established on a county-by-county basis in principle, but impoverished areas may designate a central location in several counties for establishment. 4. The number of students enrolled each year in secondary schools in each district and the number of grades added should be determined by the provincial education department based on the number of primary school graduates in the district who are seeking further education.

(3) Revision and Formulation of Secondary School Curriculum Standards

1. English in junior high school may be changed to an elective course. 2. Students who do not study English in junior high school can study Chinese language, history, geography, labor (with housework as the main focus for girls), or simple vocational subjects. 3. A labor course should be added to the first grade of senior high school, and a simple vocational elective course may still be offered in the second and third grades. 4. The curriculum for the six-year integrated secondary school should be formulated. The important principles are as follows: (1) The entire curriculum for each subject does not need to be a double circle but a consistent straight line allocation. (2) A labor course should still be listed in grades one to four. (3) History and geography should be listed together, with domestic history and domestic geography accounting for two-thirds and foreign history and foreign geography accounting for one-third. (4) Foreign languages should be gradually increased from the fourth year onwards. 5. After the revised junior and senior high school curriculum standards and the six-year secondary school curriculum standards are formulated, the key points of the teaching materials for each subject should be drafted as the basis for editing textbooks and teaching.

(4) Emphasis on Production Labor Training 1. Male students in junior and senior high schools and secondary schools must study agriculture or industry, and female students must study housework and gardening. In cities and commercially developed areas, both male and female students may also study commerce. 2. The equipment standards for the labor course should be stipulated, and all public and private secondary schools in each province and city should set them up accordingly. 3. The curriculum and practical standards for agriculture, industry, commerce, and housework must be detailed and implemented by each school accordingly. 4. It should be stipulated that each student in senior and junior high schools and secondary schools must reach the predetermined skill and quantity standards in each semester, regardless of what kind of production practice they are engaged in. 5. Regarding the training of labor teachers in primary schools, in addition to special normal courses offered by normal schools, each province and city should designate excellent vocational schools to attach labor teacher training classes, recruit graduates from senior vocational schools, and provide them with one year of training. Regarding the training of labor teachers in secondary schools, labor teacher specialty courses should be attached to normal colleges and universities or designated excellent senior vocational schools, recruit graduates from senior vocational schools, and the duration of study should be two to three years.

### Under the Power of the Xiamen Gang, Cash Fluctuations are Quite Smooth, and the European Situation Temporarily Relaxes, with the Decline Not as Bad as Expected

Yesterday's cash market fluctuations were quite smooth, with the situation stable but weak. Although the current European situation is temporarily relaxed, people still feel uneasy. In addition, the Hong Kong exchange rate is potentially loose and cheap. Combined with the continued selling by gold shops and money changers, despite the Xiamen Gang's support from a certain gold shop's strong buying at one point, the price ultimately failed to rise and fell by two yuan. Trading was flat, only about 600 taels were traded. Jewelry gold prices remained unchanged. There was no change in the Central Bank's customs gold, etc., due to the closure of the London gold market.

Cash Market Down Two Yuan

Starting in the morning, sentiment was slightly weak, with many offering to sell at 2,068 yuan per 10 taels, while buyers were only willing to absorb at 3-4 yuan lower. The two sides argued until 9:50 AM when a certain gold shop suddenly took over the Xiamen Gang's buying, and a deal was made. The first trade was a gold shop buying 50 taels each from the jewelry gang and money changers, all at 2,068 yuan, the opening price, which was unchanged from the close last Thursday (i.e., before the Spring Festival holiday). After the opening, the same gold shop bought another 100 taels from the same industries at the same price. Soon after, money changers sold 10 taels to the jewelry gang at 66 yuan. Later, the same gold shop came to buy again, taking 50 taels each from the jewelry gang and peers, all at 68 yuan. Then, the jewelry gang traded 50 taels among themselves at the same price. Later, money changers traded 50 taels among themselves for 66 yuan. Because the deal was slightly less successful, the price was set at 62 yuan. Near noon, money changers traded 50 taels among themselves again, with 66 yuan as the closing price. Trading was unusually quiet in the afternoon, and the price also rarely changed. Only 50 taels were traded from the money changers to the jewelry gang, priced at 66 yuan. Later, a certain money changer still wanted to sell at 66 yuan, but the buyer offered 65 yuan. The two sides were deadlocked until after 4:00 PM, and no deal was made. Therefore, the closing price was still 2,066 yuan, a drop of two yuan compared to last Thursday (i.e., before the Spring Festival holiday). The cash shop's full offer was sold at 2,070 yuan and bought at 2,060 yuan. The current standard gold price is 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and no trades have been made.

Jewelry Gold Prices Remain Unchanged

Jewelry gold retail prices remained unchanged because cash prices rarely changed. Datong Bank was 210 yuan, and Xintong Bank was 208 yuan, buying at 202 yuan.

Customs Gold Prices Also Unchanged

The Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash remained at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed price for customs gold was still calculated at 2.396 yuan per tael. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1,207.6 yuan, due to the closure of London gold market for the Easter holiday and the lack of updates.

### Hong Kong Exchange Rate Rises Alone, Foreign Banks Trade US Dollars Against Hong Kong Telegrams and Enter British Remittances

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw a temporary calm in Europe, and exchange rates between Britain and the United States remained largely unchanged during the holiday. This stabilized sentiment in the local market. Although major foreign firms and the Tianjin Gang attempted to intervene, foreign banks such as HSBC showed greater willingness, so the situation remained largely unchanged. As a result, there was no gain or loss. However, foreign banks engaged in some short-term dollar trading, and Hong Kong telegrams also entered British and American, and foreign banks such as Huabi swapped British and American exchange rates, totaling 4 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 fen, and 1 li. Trading was quite active throughout the day. However, because of weak telecommunications, the Hong Kong exchange rate was under strong selling pressure from foreign banks and money changers and tended to loosen.

In the early morning, the London large-denomination near-term was long at .0625, while the long-term remained unchanged. New York silver prices remained fixed, and London gold prices also showed no increase or decrease. The exchange rates for British to US, to Shanghai, and to France were all flat. US to British, to Shanghai were also flat, and to France was largely increasing (all compared to the close last Thursday). The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Bank's morning selling prices were 8 pence 25 for British exchange and 16.0625 yuan for US exchange. Both British and US exchange rates were unchanged compared to the closing last Thursday (i.e., before the Spring Festival holiday). After opening, although foreign firms and the Tianjin Gang mutually intervened, foreign banks were quite willing to fulfill orders, resulting in a lack of change. Foreign firms settled at HSBC British exchange rate of 8 pence 25, also on behalf of the Tianjin Gang settled with HSBC and Huabi British exchange rate of 8 pence 25. HSBC's listed price was announced, and the Hong Kong exchange rate alone rose by 75, while the rest were flat. The silver balance tax was announced to be larger than last Thursday, calculated as 5.00%. Later, foreign banks and Dutch banks mutually bought US exchange rates from a certain bank at 16.0625 yuan for April. Then, foreign firms absorbed US exchange rates from a certain bank at 16.025 yuan, so the potential situation remained largely unchanged. Later, foreign firms absorbed Dutch drafts at 55.75 yuan. Then, money changers sold Guangdong Hong Kong exchange (bills) at 56.25 yuan to foreign banks and Huahang. The situation was also stable. At noon, Hong Kong telegrams suddenly entered British and American markets, and Huabi exchanged British and American exchange rates with foreign banks, totaling 4 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 fen, and 1 li. By closing at noon, the bank's selling price was the same as the morning opening.

Later in the afternoon, foreign firms continued to intervene, with Huilan British exchange rate at 8 pence 25, and Huabi US exchange rate was also purchased at 16.0625 yuan. The process was also quite stable. After entering, due to the Hong Kong exchange rate's potentially weak outlook, foreign banks, especially Anta, vigorously sold, and the potential situation trended towards loosening. Anta sold Hong Kong exchange rates to foreign firms, hardening from 55.75 yuan to 56 yuan. By the closing of the evening, the bank's selling prices were British exchange at 8 pence 25 and US exchange at 16.0625 yuan. As a result, the British and American exchange rates were unchanged compared to before the Spring Festival holiday, while the Hong Kong exchange rate hardened by 25.

### Japanese Fresh Gold Notes: Fatigue and Fall

Yesterday, British gold and British-American exchange rates were both closed due to holidays. Because the port was opening, the local foreign exchange market saw strong settlements by foreign firms. Fortunately, with the continuous supply from banks and Hong Kong telegrams, the market price remained stable, with no gains or losses compared to before the closure. The cash customs market was still stable. Later, because of the large amount of jewelry gold from the mainland being brought to Shanghai and ample funds, gold shops and jewelry businesses sold heavily, and the market price was temporarily weak. Later, the Hong Kong gang of money changers took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and the decline gradually subsided. Afternoon trading was not strong, and the trend was sideways. The result was slightly soft. Large amounts of foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds were issued, but the demand was scarce. Foreign banks absorbed British and American gold notes heavily. The supply of Japanese fresh gold notes was quite smooth, and the market price became increasingly weak. Although the import of Japanese goods to Shanghai was strong, Japanese businessmen mostly exchanged for foreign exchange for collection, which did not help their national economy much. The excessive issuance of military pay by their military headquarters was scattered in various guerrilla areas in large numbers, and the people did not dare to keep it, so the supply was very high. There were few transactions in the exchange. Only Huitong issued and Xiang Kang received Hong Kong notes for 500 yuan, and Yingfeng issued and Hongchang received Hong Kong notes for 500 yuan. Yesterday's market prices compared to before the closure: British gold pound decreased by 1 jiao, British order notes decreased by 1 fen, American gold pound decreased by 2 jiao, American gold notes decreased by 2 li, Hong Kong notes increased by 2 li, French franc notes decreased by 2 hao, and the prices of other currencies remained unchanged.

### Hong Kong Exchange Market Stable, Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate Slightly Increased

Hong Kong, 11th Telegram: The opening exchange rate for British-American and Shanghai Exchange rates in the morning was the same as the price at 2:30 PM on the 6th. At 11:30 AM, the Shanghai Exchange rate increased by 2 jiao and 5 fen, with a price of 178 yuan. By 3:35 PM, the Shanghai Exchange rate had fallen back by 1 jiao and 2 fen and 5 li, with a price of 177.875 yuan. The British and American exchange rates remained unchanged throughout the day. The opening market prices in the morning are listed below:

British Exchange: 1 shilling, 2 pence, 6875

American Exchange: 28.625 yuan

Shanghai Exchange: 177.75 yuan (Shanghai Exchange is the amount of Shanghai legal tender equal to 100 Hong Kong dollars)

Tianjin, 11th Telegram: Compared with the 6th (last Thursday), the British and American exchange rates were unchanged, and the China Exchange rate increased by 2 jiao and 5 fen. The opening market prices in the morning are listed below:

British Exchange: 7 pence, 875

American Exchange: 15.375 yuan

Shanghai Exchange: 104.25 yuan (Shanghai Exchange is the amount of Tianjin that should be received for every 100 Shanghai yuan)

### Silver and Money Industry Opened Yesterday, Check Exchange Time Delayed by 30 Minutes

Yesterday was the first day of opening for the silver and money industry after the four-day Tomb Sweeping Festival holiday. All banks and firms were quite busy handling receipts and deliveries. The Bank Check Clearing House specially delayed the exchange time by 30 minutes, starting the exchange at 3:30 PM to facilitate check clearing for its members (the original exchange time was 3:00 PM every day).

### Discount Rate Falling

Yesterday's discount rate for bills of exchange gradually declined. It once fell to a low of 49 yuan per thousand yuan, but eventually rebounded slightly, with a final rate of 49 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, a drop of 2 jiao and 5 fen compared to before the holiday (6th).

### American Silver Unchanged, British and Indian Closed

New York, 10th Telegram: The price of American spot silver remained fixed, initially at 4 jiao and 2 fen and 75 li. The price of British and Indian silver was not available due to the Easter holiday closure.

### Securities: Bond Market Firm and High, Foreign Stocks Also Good

Yesterday's securities dark market situation, after a four-day holiday, had quite a few ins and outs in terms of environmental news. Suddenly it was said that the exchange was about to be auctioned, and suddenly it was said that there was no such thing. Suddenly it was said that the British ambassador went to Chongqing with peace negotiation conditions, and suddenly it was refuted. Suddenly there was also peaceful news from Chongqing. There were many arguments, but the only logical explanation was that there was a reason for the incident, but no evidence. Because the news was uncertain, sometimes appearing and sometimes disappearing, it aroused the interest of speculators. Other things like the European situation, although there was already a tense situation, the door to peace was not closed. However, in the domestic war, it has been quite dominant in the past few days. Guangzhou is not difficult to recover. There are also reports from Nanjing that the Japanese are preparing to withdraw because the Guangzhou climate does not suit them. This shows that they are making this cover-up due to unfavorable war conditions. Stimulated by this kind of news, the market suddenly saw strong buying interest. The price of Category C, excluding the winning lottery, was even higher than before the holiday. If this situation is slightly confirmed, the market price will still have the possibility of soaring and finding a new high price. Yesterday, the opening began with big firms raising prices to buy, and the prices of each immediately rose by five or six jiao. Afterwards, No. 4, No. 7, Lianhe, Tongyu, Runli, and Tongkang all bought in. At that time, Renchang, Shunheng, Defu, Shuntai, and No. 22 were all selling, and No. 9 sold more. When the market closed, No. 20 suddenly had an appetite, and the market price became firm again. The morning rose by seven or eight jiao. After the afternoon opening, No. 20 continued to absorb, and Dafeng and Tiansheng both bought in. No. 41 also opened and closed. Lianhe and Yongkang sold slightly. No. 5 exited Category C and entered Category A. The market price was first firm and then flat, and the trend was quite good. In summary, the market prices all rose, ranging from six jiao and a half to eight jiao. The price of Category C rose by 1 jiao due to the rights of excluding the winning lottery. The total number of transactions was more than 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Trading: Buyers have the greatest need for exchange tickets. Buyers offered 39 yuan and 2 jiao and a half for the Shanghai Cotton Exchange stock, but there were still no sellers. The rest also tended to be firm.

The Public Industry Association reported that during the past few holidays, there were various unfavorable rumors, and it was expected that the market price would fall sharply after the opening. However, this city saw stability. Compared with the stock markets in Europe and America, the US market fell even more, which is incomparable. Therefore, the stock holders in this port should be happy. Although the trading of various shares was not large, the prices were not much lower than before. However, Jardine Matheson and Wheelock stocks had good trading performance. The public bus stock fell sharply to 25 yuan and 5 jiao because the annual interest was only 7 jiao, which disappointed people. Although the interest paid was less, the company's annual profit was very satisfactory.

Rubber Raw Materials: Although New York telegraphed that sentiment was tight for spot conditions, rubber shares in this port continued to be scarce.

### Kodak Milk Dividend of One Yuan

The local British-owned Kodak Milk Company announced yesterday that its 1938 profit was 85,673.65 yuan in national currency, including the 118,483.34 yuan in national currency carried over from 1937, totaling 202,56.99 yuan in national currency. After paying a dividend of 1 yuan per share, totaling 80,000 yuan, it will also allocate 10,000 yuan to the dividend equalization reserve, and 125,000 yuan to the statutory reserve, leaving a remaining 27,000 yuan to be carried over to the next term. The above distribution will be announced at the shareholders' meeting on the 21st of this month, and it will be paid out.

### Knock Lao Fo Shares Issues Dividends

The board of directors of Knock Lao Fo Java Rubber Tree Co., Ltd., managed by Huitong Foreign Company in this port, decided yesterday to pay a dividend of 3 fen per share in national currency for 1938. The general meeting of shareholders for this term is also scheduled to be held on the 19th of this month.

### Yarn and Flower Southern Procurement Continues Nonstop, Yarn Market Advances Circuitously, More Than 3,700 Packages Traded, Market Price Rises 5-8 Yuan, Each Factory Opens More Than 4,000 Packages

The yarn market continued to soar, with a stable momentum. Because during the several days of this port closure, customers still transacted more than 800 packages. In addition, the needs of the Hong Kong, Yunnan, and Shantou gangs continued non-stop, and sentiment remained high. The market price was promoted by this actual transaction, but a part of it loosened because the factories opened too many numbers, and sold when the price was high. The market situation was slightly stable in the middle. The future depends on customer sales to shift. The market sentiment in the afternoon was even tighter. Recently, there has been a lot of procurement from the South, and people have been particularly excited. The selling price became higher and higher. The Yunnan gang was eager to search for 10-count coarse yarn, so the price of group yarn rose even more.

Current Yarn Situation: At the beginning of the morning opening, the market was crowded because of the several days of the holiday. The market sentiment was stable, and the public opinion was optimistic about the market price. Indeed, the Hong Kong and Chaoshan gangs had entrusted goods to be purchased. Therefore, the atmosphere was tense, and the opening price was 2 yuan higher than before the closure. 20-count Double Horse was 389 yuan. The customer sales continued to be steady, and the market price was firm. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 390.05 yuan. By the time the market closed, sellers who made a profit sold, and it fell slightly by 1 yuan. In the afternoon, because the business was still prosperous, the market price rose again, with 20-count Double Horse yarn at 392 yuan, up another 1.5 yuan. According to statistics, various gangs bought a total of 2,705 packages. The market prices of 20-count Double Horse and Tiannv yarns both rose by 5-5.5 yuan, Double Earth rose by 5 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by 3-8 yuan. The Xinyu factory opened 500 packages of 10-count Double Earth, priced at 303 yuan. The Shenxin factory opened 100 packages of 10-count Young Pioneers, priced at 309-310 yuan. The Hongzhang factory opened 200 packages of 10-count Bao Yi, priced at 300 yuan. British factories such as Jardine Matheson, Yigong, and Yangshupu opened 20-count Five Blessings, priced at 355 yuan, Shepherd, priced at 358 yuan. There were also 32-count Samsung, 42-count Samsung, 20-count Samsung, 6-count Rouge Tiger and other yarns totaling more than 4,000 packages. Today, 10 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 520 pieces were shipped to Shantou, and 55 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.

Yunnan 1050 Wenzhou 50 Fellow Traders 990

Hong Kong 1050 Fuzhou 20 Shantou 320

Inland 45 Tianjin 175 Jiangxi 15

Quanzhou 10 Total 3715

Before the port closure, the Japanese yarn market was rising rapidly. It was said that the market would rise after the port opened, but the market price in the Qingdao Exchange suddenly fell, affecting the Shanghai market price. Therefore, many people came to sell, and the price fell step by step in the morning and rebounded slightly in the afternoon. As a result, the price of 20-count Water Moon was 355 yuan, and the price of Blue Phoenix was 350-349 yuan. The yarn price fell by 1.2 yuan from the price before the stop.

### Cotton Loan Issue Still Unannounced, U.S. Cotton Prices Expected to Fall – “Fire Machine Flower” Rises Another Half Dollar –

The international cotton market in New York experienced a sharp drop in cotton prices due to the European political crisis and a plunge in New York securities. Yesterday, the market rebounded slightly due to some buying on Wall Street, but prices are still down four or five pounds compared to before the holiday. Washington has not yet announced any decisions regarding loans, but it is generally expected that an announcement will be made within days. While the details are unknown, there is no doubt that cotton prices will fall. Yesterday, the Indian cotton market fell two rupees compared to before the holiday, and Egyptian cotton also fell more than twenty pounds. The exchange rate yesterday was not much different from before the holiday. Converting to legal tender, cotton prices all fell, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton each falling thirty cents per picul, Indian cotton falling seventy cents, and Egyptian cotton falling one dollar and fifty cents.

In Shanghai, trading in foreign cotton has been brisk recently, especially in coarse yarn, with prices rising sharply. Coarse yarn is selling faster than fine yarn, and factories are finding it easier to profit from coarse yarn due to faster and higher output. Many factories have recently been increasing their production. However, the raw materials for spinning coarse and fine yarns, such as Tongzhou Yaohua cotton, are priced quite high, and transportation is inconvenient. Yaohua cotton can no longer be transported out, so factories are competing to buy Indian Pingguo cotton as a substitute. Yesterday, Rongfeng imported 1,000 bales of Pingguo cotton, and Anda imported 500 bales. The futures prices for yesterday, converted to delivery to the factory, are as follows:

Local cotton business is still conducted secretly as usual. Demand from all parties is flat. Only Hongzhang imported 108 pieces, just for show, and there was no other significant activity. Japanese factories are quiet. There is some trading in white-package cotton from the head of the dock among fellow traders, but market prices are rising along with yarn prices. Tongzhou cotton has risen half a dollar compared to before the closure, and "fire machine flower" has also risen several dimes. The situation for local cotton remains difficult. During the few days of closure, 720 bales of Tongzhou cotton from northern Jiangsu arrived, and yesterday 504 bales arrived. There were 100 bales of wooden-frame cotton (and 60 pieces from Qidong, with 30 pieces being shipped to Hong Kong today). The amount of spot cotton transacted yesterday and market conditions are listed below:

### Grey Cloth and Domestically-Produced Fabric Sales are Booming – Prices of Eastern Cloth are High, Dyeing Factories are Choosing Domestically-Produced Goods, Tens of Thousands of Pieces of Grey Cloth Futures are Ordered on this Street

Yesterday, the selling price of domestically-produced cloth based on raw materials and yarn rose sharply. Cloth prices increased universally. All factories raised their opening prices. Colored cloth and colored twill rose by 20 to 40 cents per piece, and bleached cloth and bleached twill rose by nearly 21 and a half cents per piece. The increase in the price of various autumn grey cloths was especially dramatic. Tens of thousands of pieces were ordered on this street for the months of June, July, August, and September. Opening prices are steadily increasing, rising another 20 to 30 cents per piece compared to the previous week. White fine twill and fine cloth rose by 10 to 25 cents per piece. Dyeing factories on this street, due to the high prices of Eastern cloth, are gradually shifting their focus and selectively using domestically-produced goods. Trading is becoming more active, with over 100 bales of fine cloth and over 300 bales of fine twill being transacted. Coarse cloth sales are sluggish, and opening prices have not increased. Yihua Factory's light and heavy weights are all being sold at original prices, with only the 14-pound cloth rising by 5 cents per piece. New Yu’s 14-pound “Earth” brand is selling at a premium of 40 cents per piece due to a shortage of similar goods from competitors. The 9-pound coarse underclothing is rising by 35 cents per piece. The Hengfeng Factory’s 8-call underclothing grey cloth is rising by 20 cents per piece. Sales to remote southwestern provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangdong are the most active, with shipments continuing to be enthusiastic. Demand on this street is booming, with both seasonal goods and autumn grey cloths being in high demand. Merchants from Wenzhou are handling 40 to 50 bales of coarse cloth, with over 1,000 pieces being imported from Wenzhou to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian.

Eastern cloth prices rose too sharply before the spring holiday, and the morning selling prices of fine cloth and fine twill were universally soft. Merchants from the north also withdrew and suspended operations, and the market atmosphere eased, with prices falling by about 10 cents per piece. Afterwards, because dyeing and sales on this street were still quite good, and fellow traders were firm in their intentions, futures trading continued at around 1,000 pieces yesterday, so opening prices in the afternoon rose again. The 12-pound "Colored Ball" fine cloth still requires 13.25 yuan, but the leading brands are relatively weak, selling for only 12.90 yuan. Fine twill has not changed much, and the trend remains strong.

Exports of finished cloth on the 12th included 14 pieces to Xiamen, 300 pieces to Shantou, and 160 pieces to Hong Kong.

### A Glimpse of Woolen Cloth Sales

The woolen cloth market remained firm yesterday, a Tuesday, with brisk trading in both retail and wholesale. Among sales to other regions, medium-to-long lengths are being taken, with Chengdu, Chongqing, Xufu, Jianshui, Jiading, Kunming, and other regions being slightly stronger. Sales to Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao are also acceptable. Wenzhou, Huangyan, Jinhua, and Fujian provinces have all temporarily halted after the fall of Nanchang. Merchants from Nanjing are still making purchases, while interest from Hangzhou is weaker than before. There is only sporadic trading in the guerrilla areas of Suzhou and Jiaxing. In general, other ports accessible by mail are still making purchases. Domestically-produced goods account for most of the sales, except in guerrilla areas. Western goods are also common. Even in Beijing and Tianjin, Western-style clothing materials are mostly Western goods.

### Silk and Tea – Silk Prices are Rising Steadily

Both domestic and international silk markets have been quite firm since reopening after the holiday. The New York Stock Exchange recently reported an increase of four cents for near-term deliveries and three cents for far-term deliveries. Yesterday's total trading volume reached 2,920 bales, which can be called a record high. The Yokohama silk market rose daily during this spring holiday, remaining extraordinarily firm. Yesterday, spot prices rose sharply by 20 yuan, and far-term prices rose by 9 yuan. Observing the overseas silk market, the phenomenon of "squeezing" on spot goods seems to continue.

Recently, the silk market in Shanghai has seen repeated transactions due to stable public sentiment before and after the spring holiday. The increase in prices in Japan and the US has not had a drastic impact, allowing the market to remain close to exports. According to silk industry insiders, since the Shanghai silk market has returned to normal, nearly 1,000 bales of Shanghai-produced foreign silk have been traded in the ten days before and after the spring holiday. The gradual recovery of silk prices by about 40 yuan is a very pleasing phenomenon. Yesterday, silk trading in Shanghai continued to expand. White factory 81, 20-22 denier stripe, priced at 1,650 yuan. 78, 20-22 denier stripe, priced at 1,620 yuan. Renji, Lianna, and other firms imported nearly 100 bales in total. The highest grades of Qilin and Running Horse silk from six companies in Ji'an are in high demand overseas, and silk trading is expected to expand further.

On the 11th, 118 pieces of silk were shipped to Europe, and 4 tons of tea were shipped to Marseille.

### Grain – Merchants from Southeast Asia are Making Healthy Purchases of Factory Flour – 3,000 Bags of Wheat Sold to the North

Factory Flour: Yesterday was the first day of trading after the Qingming Festival holiday, and trading in factory spot flour seemed lively, but actual sales were not brisk. Merchants from northern China were trying to depress prices due to high remittance rates, while factories were reluctant to lower prices further, citing rising international reports and abundant Shanghai flour supplies. It is said that merchants from Southeast Asia were gradually becoming more active, with transactions exceeding 20,000 bags. The asking price for No. 2 flour was still 4.40 yuan, and the wholesale price on this street was the same, with nearly 10,000 bags being transacted. It is also reported that merchants from northern China contacted factories in the evening to negotiate wholesale transactions, with a proposal to depress the price by a few cents, but this has not been confirmed. According to news from merchants, over 100,000 bags have been shipped to Tianjin, Yantai, and other places during the holiday. If prices can be especially cheap, purchases will not be weak. It is reported that 75,000 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin today, and another 1,000 bags were shipped to Xiamen.

Foreign Flour: Yesterday, sales of foreign flour also became active. International production prices remain firm, and long-term orders are still uneconomical. Although new arrivals were during the holiday, local merchants continued to distribute them continuously, and transactions reached more than 100,000 bags. Merchants from northern China also bought a lot, and retail sales on this street were also lively. Because sales were still active, sellers were not eager to sell, so wholesale prices were relatively stable. Brands such as "Bat", "Double Eagle", and "Lamp" were all sold for 4.30 yuan by remittance, but the high-end brand "Red Sun" required 4.30 yuan cash, with prices varying depending on the brand.

Wheat: Newly arrived goods included 4,000 to 5,000 bags in small quantities from Nanjing and Jiangbei, including 3,000 bags from Xingang. It is also said that a foreign firm has several thousand bags arriving. Factories’ appetite remains sluggish, because the combined price of foreign wheat is cheaper than domestic wheat. In addition to orders arriving steadily, a new batch of Australian wheat has been ordered, totaling 7,500 tons, with delivery scheduled before the end of this month. Therefore, the demand for domestic wheat from factories is difficult to be enthusiastic. However, merchants still favor it. Merchants from the north purchased more than 3,000 bags of wheat from Jiangbei and Nanjing at a price of 7.13 yuan to 7 yuan, and the market remained firm. The wheat market, which had been stalled for many days, even opened its doors on the first day after the reopening.

### Rice Sales on this Street Declined

Sources of community rice from various groups included 8 cars of "Wheelbarrow" and "Baozi" brands from He Xia, over 2,000 bags from the Su Tong group, 500 bags from the Kunshan group, and 250 bags from the Changzhou group. The general market situation, which turned soft the day before yesterday, saw a decline in sales on this street yesterday, and stockpilers’ appetite also weakened, resulting in a weary situation. As a result, the prices of both thick and thin japonica rice, except for high-grade goods, have depreciated slightly from the highs of the day before yesterday. The price of Du Yang Jian Bu Jian is quite good because of the scarcity of goods, and supply and demand are equal, with no difference.

Both merchants and stockpilers were sluggish yesterday for customer indica rice. The street selected high-quality rice for slight purchases. Therefore, although the high-quality indica rice from Wuhu opened at high prices of 13.40 yuan and 13.30 yuan, the market was extremely soft. Lowering the price by 5 to 6 cents still lacked buyers. The total number of transactions for the day was only over 1,000 bags. If the sales to customers are still sluggish today and tomorrow, then the selling price may have to be gradually lowered. Because of the ample inventory at present and the continuous source, most people in the market are downstream.

On the 12th, 400 bags of corn were shipped to Tianjin. The production price soared again by 7 yuan. According to the current purchase price in Shanghai, it should be in the range of 50 yuan, but it is not a particularly high-quality product. The import and export have already been reversed. 260 bags came from Shantou, and 370 bags came from Xiamen.

### Oil Cakes - High Prices for Raw Soybean Oil are Repeatedly Seen

The issue of unified management of soybean oil is still unclear, and there is no way to compromise, leading to heightened public sentiment and new highs emerging one after another. More than 160 barrels of Dalian oil were opened, with the price starting at 41 yuan and gradually increasing sharply. As a result, the price was 42.50 yuan, an increase of 2.80 yuan from the previous day's market. 200 pieces of Yanqi oil were transacted at 31 yuan, an increase of 1.80 yuan. 200 dan of Dayou Factory oil were traded at 32.70 yuan, an increase of 1.70 yuan.

The price of raw oil followed in the footsteps of soybean oil, rising steadily and seeing new highs frequently, which is rare in recent years. It is estimated that 270 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were transacted yesterday, with prices ranging from 33.20 yuan to 34 yuan, an increase of 1.50 yuan from the previous market. 100 pieces were transacted in April for 32.50 yuan, an increase of 50 cents. 30 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded at 45 yuan, also an increase of 50 cents from the previous market. As a result, the retail price is 37 cents per catty for soybean oil and 40 cents per catty for raw oil.

### North-South Goods - Jianqu is Upside Down - Production Price Rises by Another 7 Yuan

Fujian red yeast is made from rice. Because rice has been scarce in the area recently, there is even less red yeast for sale, and production prices have risen again and again. According to news from the Fuzhou merchants yesterday,

### Coal - Coal Ball Industry Establishes Agreement

Due to competition among peers last month, the price of coal balls once plummeted. Now, through the mediation of the guild, a compromise has been reached. The price of Yitaixing and Nanyang's Zhengpai brand is 33 yuan per ton delivered to the same industry, and the price of the Vicepai brand is 29 yuan, plus 1 yuan for car force. The price of goods from small factories is reduced by 5 cents to 1 yuan. Each hundred catties sold to customers in the main stores are sold for 1.80 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains - Lian Bean Futures - Slight Short Covering Transactions, Spot Market Prices Frequently Rise

Spot trading in yellow soybeans has not been strong, but prices have been rising frequently under the shadow of the unified management issue. Yesterday, the price of each bean in the market continued to rise by 10 to 20 cents. It is estimated that more than 500 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow were purchased on this street, with prices rising from 8.80 yuan to 9.10 yuan. Four cars of Dalian beans were sold by Yuanfang, with prices of 9 yuan and 9.10 yuan. One car was transacted on this street, with the quoted price being 8.90 yuan. Because there is still no clear way to implement the rumored deal for Dalian to facilitate exports, a portion of the April futures beans were used to cover short positions. A total of 13 to 14 cars were traded, with prices of 8.60 yuan to 8.70 yuan, an increase of 14 cents compared to the previous market.

11.5 tons of beans were shipped to Columbus on the 11th, and 90 bags of sesame seeds came from Qidong.

### Miscellaneous Items Egg Yolk and Egg White Shipped to England in Large Quantities

Egg yolk and egg white are a major export from China. Since being hit by the war, exports have gradually decreased. On the 11th of this month, 620 tons of egg yolk and egg white were shipped to London. On the Shanghai side, 2,420 fresh eggs were shipped from Xingang.

Correction: The two types of shark fins, "Quan Gou" and "Wu Gou," mentioned in yesterday's casual chat are both Japanese goods, mistakenly classified as Western goods. "Quan Gou" was mistaken for "Jin Gou." The correction should be made.

### Detained Ships Have Entered Port – Passengers Completely Released – Portuguese Consul Visits Miura to Protest – Imported Ships Still Under Surveillance – Shipping Companies Exert All Efforts to Maintain the Shanghai-Wenzhou Route –

After Japanese warships detained Portuguese merchant ships in the waters off eastern Zhejiang, the Portuguese consul protested to the Japanese consul yesterday. The detained ships have now entered the port and are docked at the Yangshupu buoys, still under surveillance by Japanese soldiers. However, the passengers have been completely released, and the Shanghai-Wenzhou route is operating as usual. Details are as follows:

Detained Ships Sail into Wusong: The detained ships, under the surveillance of Japanese warships, sailed from the waters off eastern Zhejiang to the outer port of Wusong and anchored. The Portuguese Zhengde Company’s Li Bao wheel had already entered the port on the afternoon of the 9th and docked at buoy No. 18 in Yangshupu. Today, the American Huamei Company’s Tang Qiao, Tang Bei, Tang Lu, the Portuguese Meili Company’s Mei Da, the Portuguese Atlantic Company’s Hai Long, and the Portuguese Wanguo Company’s Lu De and Bao De were all notified by the Japanese Navy to sail into the port of Wusong yesterday and dock at buoys No. 16, 17, and 18 in Yangshupu, together with the Li Bao wheel that entered on the 9th and the Greek Livormo wheel that was previously detained.

Passengers Released and Transported Ashore: Although the ships had sailed into the port of Wusong and docked at the Yangshupu buoys, each ship was still guarded by soldiers sent by the Japanese warships, who were monitoring the actions of the ships. Radio operators had all lost their freedom. As for the passengers on each ship, yesterday the Japanese warships sent tugs and small motorboats to transport the passengers and luggage from Mei Da, Tang Bei, Tang Qiao, Tang Lu, Hai Long, and other ships to the New Customs Wharf and landed them. However, the crew remained on board the ships, and cargo was not allowed to be unloaded. Furthermore, the Lu De and Bao De wheels are deck ships mainly used to carry cargo, so there were no passengers on this trip to Wenzhou.

Reasons Given by the Japanese Navy: At a reception for foreign journalists the day before yesterday, a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy authorities said that the detention of ships flying the Portuguese flag was currently under investigation to determine the truth. They deeply believe that the owners of the detained ships are still Chinese merchants, and that foreigners are only collecting flag commission fees. Furthermore, some ships are actually supplying Chinese guerrillas. The Portuguese Consul-General has not yet filed a protest with the consulate, but he did visit the consulate regarding the detention of the ships. It is reported that the Portuguese Consul believes the Japanese Navy spokesperson’s statement is unfounded and inconsistent with the facts.

Portuguese Consul Visits Miura to Protest: After receiving reports from shipping companies regarding the detention of Portuguese merchant ships by Japanese warships, the Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai, Alves, immediately negotiated with the Japanese Consul and Naval authorities in Shanghai. Due to the spring holiday, no results were obtained for several days. Yesterday, with the end of the spring holiday, work resumed, and at 11:00 a.m., he visited Consul-General Miura at the Japanese Consulate and lodged a strong protest, demanding the immediate release of the ships and presenting evidence proving that the ships were indeed owned by Portuguese merchants. It is reported that the Japanese side has agreed to release the passengers first and said that the nationality of the ships has been investigated, resulting in no satisfactory outcome.

Request to Allow Chartered Ships to Sail: The Dinghai Shanghai Hometown Association, in view of the detention of the Li Bao wheel sailing on the Dinghai-Ningbo line at Zhushanmen, which was delayed along the way for four days, and which has now been forced to come to Shanghai, with all passengers being from the same hometown and with their travel expenses exhausted due to the unexpected detention, plans to charter foreign ships to take them back to their native Dinghai. Those who wish to go to Dinghai are asked to contact the association for registration starting immediately. In addition, the Li Bao wheel authorities have chartered the German Luxin Shipping Company’s Gaodeng wheel to come from Dinghai to Shanghai to load the stranded passengers back to Dinghai. It is reported that the Gaodeng wheel is currently docked in Dinghai and has not yet sailed to Shanghai. Because Dinghai is a restricted port, they are currently seeking approval from the Ningbo Garrison Commander.

Passengers on Each Ship Undergo a Great Shock: Yesterday, the New Voice News reporter met a passenger on the Tang Lu wheel, who said that after the Japanese warships detained the ships, they sent Japanese soldiers to board the ships for inspection. It was not until today that they were allowed to land. The passengers on each ship have all undergone a great shock. In addition to confirming the Tang Bei, Tang Lu, Tang Qiao, Hai Long, Mei Da, Li Bao, and deck ships Lu De and Bao De, there is also one deck ship whose name has not been identified. However, according to shipping company news, it is a Belgian ship and not one sailing on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line. As for the Portuguese Far East Company’s deck ship Da Mao, it has been confirmed that it has not been detained.

Shipping Companies Exert All Efforts to Maintain Navigation: Since the Portuguese merchant ships were detained, the Portuguese ships Mei Fa, Tang Sai, and Shantai have all postponed their voyages. However, German and Italian ships are operating the Shanghai-Wenzhou line as usual. (1) The German Luxin Shipping Company’s Feikang wheel is scheduled to clear customs today and sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou tomorrow morning. (2) The Italian Yihua Shipping Company’s Baoli wheel is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou tomorrow. (3) The German Lihe Shipping Company’s Haifu wheel is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the morning of the 15th.

### Japanese Army Intensifies Security – It is Rumored that Wusong will be Closed to Shipping – Guerrilla Warfare West of Baoshan is Extremely Active – Over 40 Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded in Liuhuo

Guerrilla forces in areas west of Baoshan, such as Luodian and Jiading, are said to be quite active. Recently, guerrilla forces have been discovered in various rural areas of Baoshan, Wusong, and Dachang. Due to the small number of stationed Japanese troops in these areas, special security measures have been implemented to prevent ambushes by guerrilla forces that may appear or disappear at any time. Regardless of whether they are male or female villagers, they must carry a pass to enter and exit, and they are also subject to strict searches. A few days ago, five rural women who went to the town from Yangxing were searched by Japanese soldiers and female inspectors stationed at the town entrance. One of the women had a box cannon hidden in her crotch, and another woman had 20 bullets hidden in the back of her cotton jacket. Both were discovered. The Japanese soldiers believed that the two women were transporting weapons for the guerrilla forces, so they transferred all five rural women to the Japanese military police headquarters for detention. The next day, in Wusong Township, three rural women were also detained by Japanese soldiers after being inspected, because they were believed to be transporting weapons for the guerrilla forces, and they have not been released to this day. As a result, there is talk of closing Wusong to shipping, and residents are greatly alarmed.

Xu Hongfa Moves Out of Chuansha City

Xu Hongfa’s followers, who were initially stationed in Chuansha City, were later forced to leave because their subordinates were treacherous and plundered at will, making life unbearable for the merchants and residents of the city. They specially devised a plan to persuade him to leave. Xu also knew that public anger was difficult to overcome and that he could not stay for long, so he moved to Shenjiazai. Near the 7th of this month, he moved his office to a residence at Panjiaqiao, outside the south gate of Chuansha, forcibly occupying a larger house and deploying his followers around the Kong family residence, Wei family residence, Wang family residence, He family residence, and Zhang family residence to prevent accidents. Local residents dare to be angry but dare not speak out, fearing that if he does not leave, they will inevitably suffer. It is reported that the guerrilla forces are also waiting patiently for an opportunity to launch a major attack.

Ambush on the Shanghai-Taicang Road

Tangqiao Town, located on the Shanghai-Taicang Road north of Dachang in western Shanghai, has always been the defense area of the ×th team of the Border Area People’s Self-Defense Force, with a total of three companies stationed there. On the morning of the 9th of this month, they had an ambush with the enemy. After about an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and sent in a large number of reinforcements. The three companies also cooperated with each other, attacking from the front and responding from the rear, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. They immediately captured five enemy soldiers, seized some weapons, and left swiftly.

Japanese Soldiers in Liuhuo Discard Weapons and Flee

The guerrilla forces in Liuhuo, led by Commander-in-Chief Fan ××, launched a night attack on the Japanese army last night (the 10th), surrounding the Japanese army headquarters, attacking from three sides. The Japanese army resisted upon hearing the alarm, but their retreat was cut off, so they desperately tried to break out, attempting to escape eastward. The guerrilla forces immediately tracked them down and killed them. The Japanese army lost their fighting spirit and discarded their weapons, fleeing in all directions. In this battle, over 40 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and the guerrilla forces only suffered one wounded warrior, capturing over 20 guns.

Japanese and Puppet Troops Suddenly Impose Martial Law in Pudong

Starting yesterday (the 10th), the Japanese and puppet troops in Pudong suddenly imposed martial law again, densely deploying posts along the riverbanks, stacking obstacles in the streets and key passes, creating a tense situation. According to investigations from various sources, it has become clear that the Japanese army received a secret report a few days ago, claiming that plainclothes teams would attack Pudong and eliminate the Japanese and puppet troops. Therefore, the Japanese side took this panicked action.

Japanese Build Pillboxes in 63rd Flower Garden

The Japanese army is building two small pillboxes on the side of the 63rd Flower Garden at the end of North Sichuan Road, one controlling Jiangwan and Wusong to the east, and the other controlling the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to the west. Construction has now begun, and it will take three months to complete. Over 100 Japanese engineers are currently supervising dozens of Chinese coolies, working day and night to rush the construction.

### Yu Zhifei Abandons His Post to Join the Army

Yu, formerly an employee of a weaving factory, has now joined the anti-Japanese army in the suburbs of Shanghai. Yu Zhifei, a worker at the Renhe Weaving Factory in the French Concession of this city, is 20 years old and hails from Kunshan County. He started as an apprentice at the factory and was exceptionally diligent in his duties. He was loyal and appropriate in his dealings with others. The factory authorities highly valued him. He had only been at the factory for a little over two years, and before his apprenticeship was even complete, he was promoted to employee. He was entrusted with important responsibilities and given a particularly generous salary. His colleagues in the factory also enjoyed being around him. He was truly a promising young man. Since the outbreak of the war, he has been deeply stimulated in spirit and has repeatedly expressed to others his desire to join the fight against the enemy. Those who heard him all thought it was just a joke and did not expect him to actually do it. Unexpectedly, two nights ago, he suddenly left the factory without saying where he was going. Last night, his colleagues at the factory received a letter from him, stating that he had gone to join the anti-Japanese army in the suburbs of Shanghai. His colleague, Chang, immediately informed his cousin, Qian Zhenwan, by telephone. Yu's entry into the factory was through Qian's introduction. Although Qian approves of his service to the country, he is concerned that there are still outstanding procedures at the factory. He is currently trying to find him and hopes that he will quickly send a letter explaining everything so that he can go and take care of it on his behalf.

### Zhejiang West Cargo Ships Cease Coming to Shanghai

Yesterday, the foreign merchant Delai Tugboat Company towed eight rice and cargo ships to Shanghai south of the blockade line at Yulai Temple on the upper reaches of the Huangpu River. It is reported that the original plan was to tow more than twenty ships in total. Now, because the Chinese army in western Zhejiang has rectified measures for the main food and goods, and temporarily prohibited exports, twenty more rice ships have ceased coming to Shanghai. It is heard that in the future, Shanghai merchants going to western Zhejiang to purchase goods must have a legal purchasing permit to avoid aiding the enemy. On the one hand, it can also maintain the livelihood and safety of the people in the newly controlled areas of the Chinese army.

### Far East British Ships Install Armed Equipment Handled by Hong Kong and Kowloon Dockyards to Prepare for Wartime Needs

The British government, in preparation for wartime needs, has ordered the installation of armed equipment on merchant ships of that country. Merchant ships sailing on the Far East routes are being equipped by the Hong Kong and Kowloon dockyards. Most are equipped with four-inch caliber gun positions. Some ships that have to undertake transportation in combat zones are equipped with equipment that can withstand the power of four-inch caliber guns, such as the installation of steel plates. Shipyards in Singapore, Australia, and other places have also received instructions from the British government to undertake this modification and armament project.

### 3,000 Jewish Refugees to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month Half Arriving on German Ships, Each Forced to Pay 2,000 Yuan

The Continental Daily News reports that yesterday evening (the 10th), it was learned from those in charge that more than 3,000 Jewish refugees from Europe are expected to arrive in Shanghai next month. About 1,500 of them will arrive on two German ships specifically transporting them. It is expected that the remaining 1,600 to 1,800 people will disembark here on the Italian mail ship "Cesare," which is sailing to Shanghai for the first time. Almost all of the refugees on the two German ships were expelled by the National Socialist Party police. According to news from this city, they were all forced to pay a shipping fee of 2,000 yuan before being allowed to board the ships. To avoid the foreign exchange that would be required to transit the Suez Canal, the two German ships will take the route around the Cape of Good Hope to Shanghai. The refugees on the Italian ship are from other parts of Central Europe and Germany. The total number of German Jewish refugees in Shanghai has already exceeded 5,000, but when the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde" arrives in Shanghai on April 25, it will carry about 600 more men, women, and children. According to sources in charge, by the end of this year, there will be at least 8,000 Jews in Shanghai.

### Kuling Library Has Been Bombed

The Continental Daily News reported yesterday (the 10th) that shortly after 34 foreigners withdrew from Kuling in late February, the Chinese library opposite the Kuling American School was hit by bombs dropped by Japanese planes. This matter has now been almost confirmed. It is heard that the foreigners staying on the mountain now feel that Japanese planes will not bomb that part of Kuling again. The Japanese side has allowed that they will no longer carry out indiscriminate bombing within the foreign property industry line in Kuling and seem to be keeping their promise. Since the indiscriminate bombing mentioned by the foreigners who evacuated to Shanghai on February 27, Japanese planes have dropped bombs outside the limits of the foreign property industry. It is heard that those previously bombed included the Bank of China, a certain German building, a Catholic church, and the residence of Mr. Tev, whose residence was located at the boundary between the foreign property and the Chinese area.

### Puppet "Police Bureau Secretary Chief" Xi Shitai Shot Dead Chinese Police and Pedestrians Hit and Injured The Strong Man Calmly Evaded After the Incident

At 9:15 yesterday morning, a shooting occurred on Lloyd Road in the Public Concession, targeting Xi Shitai, the secretary chief of the puppet municipal police bureau. Xi was shot several times and died soon after. Stray bullets injured a Chinese police officer, No. 730, and a pedestrian named Peng Fulin. Details are as follows:

Appointed to a False Position Xi Shitai was from Dongting Mountain, Jiangsu, and was 49 years old. He lived at No. 12, Juyi Lane, Lloyd Road. He studied in Japan in his early years and graduated from Tokyo Medical University. After returning to China, he practiced medicine in Shanghai and opened the Shitai Medical Clinic. He had three wives at home, the second of whom was Japanese, whom Xi met during his studies in Japan. He had two sons and three daughters. He had been practicing medicine for many years and could have barely maintained a comfortable life. After the retreat of the National Army from the west, Xi became restless and went to serve as the secretary chief of the puppet police bureau. Since then, he has had a new car, license plate number 3172. Xi's eldest son, Xingzhi, also serves as the director of a certain radio station established by a certain party, specializing in broadcasting bizarre news.

Strong Man Sniper At 9:15 yesterday morning, Xi left his residence at No. 12, Juyi Lane. The south alley of the lane is usually not open, so Xi entered and exited through the back door when he went out. Unexpectedly, after walking a few steps, two strong men suddenly appeared, one wearing a long gown and the other wearing short clothes. Each took out a Mauser pistol, and one of them immediately shot Xi, firing five or six shots. All the bullets hit Xi's head and chest. The other strong man monitored Song Jiangrong, the No. 177 informant of the lane. After Xi was seriously injured, he fell to the ground bleeding.

Chinese Police Hit by Bullets At that time, Chinese police officer No. 730 from the Laozha Police Station happened to be passing by. Upon hearing the gunshots, he bravely entered the alley and blew his whistle. Seeing him rush over, the strong man immediately shot at the Chinese police officer. Both sides fired five or six shots. Subsequently, Chinese police officer No. 730 was hit by a bullet in the chest and immediately fell to the ground. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the two strong men immediately ran out of the alley and calmly evaded to other places.

Died Midway Subsequently, the Laozha Police Station received a report and immediately dispatched police cars and detectives to the scene of the incident. They sent the injured Chinese police officer and the dying Xi Shitai to the police hospital. However, because the bullets hit vital parts, Xi died on the way. The police station then sent Xi to the coroner's office and reported to the court for inspection. The injured Chinese police officer is expected to be saved after being admitted to the hospital.

Pedestrians Affected As a result of the mutual shooting, a pedestrian named Peng Fulin, from Liyang, aged 23, was also hit in the left breast by a stray bullet. The bullet exited from the back. After Peng was injured, he was escorted to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The police station sent two Chinese police officers to guard him. It is reported that Peng's residence is at No. 11, Wenxian Lane, Lafayette Road. After being admitted to the hospital, his condition was quite serious, so as of last night, his life was still in danger. Yesterday afternoon, several people from a certain party went to the hospital to investigate everything in detail.

Polish Minister Expresses Military and Civilians Unite to Defend Against Aggression Always Prepared to Resist Aggression Encourages Polish Overseas Compatriots to Maintain Their Patriotic Spirit

The Continental Daily News reports that more than 150 members of the Polish Youth Federation held a tea dance party at the Youth Association last night (the 10th). Baron Weidensey, the Polish Minister to China, also attended the meeting. Komasrowski, the president of the Shanghai branch of the Polish Youth Federation, spoke at the meeting, saying that Poland is currently facing great danger. Mr. Wei then rose to speak, saying that he was not prepared to give a speech, but he intended to correct what Mr. Ke said about Poland facing great danger. Mr. Wei then expressed the opposite view, saying, "I really don't think Poland is facing any danger today. On the contrary, although there are doubters today, Poland is still in a normal situation. Although there are currently negotiations on Danzig and the so-called corridor, there is no real danger to Poland. If there is any need to resist aggression to defend its borders, Poland is always prepared. Its military and civilians are confident that they will do their best to defend every inch of its territory. Although the newspaper yesterday published news that Germany may resort to force to make Poland accept its demands, we don't need to panic or fear." Mr. Wei finally expressed his gratitude to the Polish Youth Federation for inviting him to attend the meeting and expressed his pleasure that the younger Polish overseas compatriots and the older ones jointly maintained their loyalty and patriotism. Earlier, President Ke gave a brief speech at the beginning of the tea dance party, welcoming all the participants and urging the young people present not to forget the serious dangers Poland is currently facing so that they can fully understand their responsibility to protect the country when necessary. Father Steticsiak, who recently came to Shanghai from Poland, also spoke at the meeting, saying that the existence of the Polish Youth Federation in this city is a healthy sign of Poland's reunification and strength in the past 125 years, which is deeply gratifying.

### Hai Ge Road Mansion Rumored to Still Be Opening a Gambling House Obstacles Erected Expected to Cause Repercussions Also Said to Be Operating in the "Avenue" Area

The Continental Daily News reports that the house at No. 448 Hai Ge Road is rumored to be used to open a luxurious gambling house, so on Saturdays and Sundays, wire mesh barriers were erected outside the wall of the house along the Public Concession. There are still 24 Chinese workers inside repairing and decorating. The house has no other way to enter except for the main gate facing Hai Ge Road, which has already been blocked. Since Saturday, police have been waiting in front of it. According to yesterday's (10th) proof, no one has entered the house. Many believe that a large amount of food is stored in it. Yesterday, according to police sources, the workers in the house can leave the house at any time, but they are not allowed to re-enter through the main gate of Hai Ge Road. Yesterday, it was also learned that several people, either Koreans, Taiwanese, or Japanese, are still in the house. The police have not yet confirmed who the tenant of the house is. It is heard that these people have invested 60,000 Chinese yuan to renovate this red-walled building. The exterior is newly built with granite, and it is heard that the interior is currently being greatly renovated to meet the needs of the gambling house. In view of the huge investment, many expect that there will be repercussions after the police department erected obstacles outside the main gate and wall of the Hai Ge Road. If the investors intend to operate a gambling house, they will lose their investment if they are prevented from doing so before it even starts. However, some say that their investment may not be completely lost, because in the current housing situation in Shanghai, the house can easily be sold. Yesterday, according to informed sources, it is believed that the investors have spent a lot of money to operate a gambling house, and they must have some kind of guarantee, so it is expected that the action of erecting obstacles by a certain daily bureau will cause disputes. However, yesterday, according to informal sources, the relevant Japanese authorities and the Municipal Council Police Department have reached an agreement that the Japanese authorities will allow gambling dens to operate within the "Avenue" area and will not allow gambling dens that can be directly connected to roads outside the boundary to operate.

### Japanese Side Investigates Foreign Property in Coastal Zhejiang and Fujian Report Must Be Submitted Today or They Will Not Be Responsible

Regarding the fact that Consul General White recently notified the German and Italian consulates to investigate the property of third countries along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian, a reporter from Xiandai She was the first to report it. However, due to the Spring Festival holiday, the consulate was closed, so the original text could not be recorded. Only yesterday was the original text obtained, and it is translated as follows: (Omitted above) According to reports from the naval and air force authorities, recently, all properties with the flags and markings of third countries have been increasing in various places along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian. These markings are quite questionable. Therefore, in order to clarify the truth, please inform the merchants of your country that all properties in the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian should be listed on a notification form and sent to the Consulate General for transmission to the Japanese Military Bureau by April 12, 1939 (Wednesday) for attention. Otherwise, the Japanese side believes that the property marked with the third country's flag contains suspicious points and will be confirmed as the property of the Chinese people and will be used as an attack target. If any damage occurs as a result, the Japanese side will not be responsible. According to the above notice, it was only sent to the consulates of Germany and Italy in Shanghai. The United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries have not received the notice.

### Opinions on Spiritual Mobilization from Various Public Groups in This City Broad Mobilization of the Entire Nation All Sectors Should Form National Monthly Meetings Local Work Still Requires Effort

Since the Central Government issued the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters has been actively promoting the propaganda movement by leading all sectors of society. The Shanghai All-Circles Spiritual Mobilization Headquarters has also been established. We support the Party Headquarters and the Headquarters to lead us with 120,000 points of sincerity and enthusiasm. At the same time, we also express our opinions on the promotion of spiritual mobilization work. Every member of our various national salvation groups must, under the leadership of the Party Headquarters and the Headquarters, regard this movement as the center of our work and develop local work in coordination with this central work. Our opinions are as follows:

(1) We believe that the War of Resistance is entering a new and more difficult stage. Chairman Chiang has already indicated to us that in this new stage, politics is more important than military affairs. The introduction to the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline also clearly points out that in this new stage, "the difficulties that our people need to overcome through tempering and struggling are also increasing day by day compared with the previous stage. The enemy now knows that military power is not enough to subdue us and achieve their goals, so their recent plan is to shake our will and threaten our spirit in various ways." What we mean by politics being more important than military affairs refers to the development of the work itself, but the purpose of our work must be military affairs first and victory first.

(2) Therefore, our national spiritual mobilization is actually a broad political mobilization of the entire nation. The first thing here is a broad ideological mobilization. In order to overcome all the difficulties in the current stage of the War of Resistance, defeat the enemy's tricks, and persist in the War of Resistance until the final victory, we must strengthen the people's will, strengthen the people's confidence in the final victory, refute all the wavering and compromise ideas of traitors and pro-Japanese factions, and establish a sound and correct ideological system. This is also what the Mobilization Outline says: "What should be devoted to today is to focus on the revitalization and concentration of the spirit." In other words, we should base ourselves on the three major principles of "nation first, people first, military first, victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of strength" to combat all traitorous ideas that betray the nation and destroy military victory, shake will, and disperse strength, and promote the revolutionary spirit of the Three People's Principles.

(3) Because the National Spiritual Mobilization is aimed at the enemy's and traitors' conspiracy of political offensive, the enemy and traitors will inevitably try every means to sabotage our spiritual mobilization. For example, they can use the principles of "nation first, nation first, will concentrate, and ideological concentration" to justify correcting divergent and complicated ideas, to provoke the emotions between various parties, classes, and even groups within the national united front, and cause mutual friction and annexation. But we should point out that the so-called nation first and nation first are precisely aimed at the conspiracy of the enemy and traitors and are precisely to oppose the conspirators who split the country, the nation, and destroy the united front, and cannot be interpreted as restricting people's groups and repelling a certain party. The so-called correcting divergent and complicated ideas refers precisely to the ideas of traitors and compromisers, and cannot be distorted to mean restricting people's freedom of thought and belief and canceling people's freedom of speech and publication. Under the premise of not violating the revolutionary spirit of the Three People's Principles and not destroying the united front and hindering the War of Resistance, not only should they not be restricted, but they should also be guaranteed and promoted to allow each party, class, and group to exist and develop, so that each can contribute its best efforts to the War of Resistance. Not only should they not be banned, but also various opinions and various theories should be encouraged to discuss and learn from each other in order to collect ideas and broaden the benefits.

(4) However, the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement is by no means just an ideological mobilization. At the same time, it is also a broad organizational work of the entire nation. Correct revolutionary ideas, once accepted by the broad masses, become a great force. But this force must be organized and trained before it can be given a high degree of development and give the enemy a fatal blow. This is also clearly pointed out in the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline: "To mobilize the spirit of the national people to enrich the national strength of the War of Resistance, it is not only about mobilization, but also about organization. It is necessary to use the spirit of organization to develop the human resources of organization and use the materials of organization to adapt to the current needs of the country."

### The Liddell Ballroom Riot the Other Night: Soldiers from Four Nations in a Vicious Brawl, Italian Soldiers Start Trouble with a British Soldier; British, French, and American Soldiers Join Forces; Many Soldiers and Bar Girls Injured

The Shanghai Evening Post reports that, before midnight last night (the 10th), in the Liddell Ballroom (LittloClub) in Jing'an Temple, Italian Marine Corps soldiers attacked a soldier from the British Seaforth Highlanders. About 35 to 40 Italian sailors then engaged in a vicious fight with a smaller number of British, French, and American soldiers and sailors. As a result, the interior of the ballroom was completely destroyed, and two Russian bar girls were injured, one of whom suffered a serious head injury and had to be taken to the hospital. Three French sailors also sustained severe head injuries. Several Seaforth Highlanders soldiers and British and American sailors suffered minor injuries, mostly from being hit by bottles. The Italian sailors, being greater in number, had the upper hand in the fight, but it was reported that three of them were punched and temporarily knocked unconscious. When Italian officers arrived in a military truck and took the Italian soldiers back to their barracks, the fighting stopped. Several bar girls, with blood-stained clothes, were seen running out of the ballroom screaming, revealing that a fight had broken out inside. Other bar girls who could not escape hid in the back kitchens until the fighting subsided, after which they emerged. A Shanghai Evening Post reporter arrived at the scene a few minutes after the brawl and saw Italian officers ordering sailors to board a large truck parked at the entrance, which was quickly filled and driven away. The interior of the Liddell Ballroom was in a state of ruin, with tables, chairs, and doors mostly damaged, and broken bottles and glass shards scattered all over the floor. According to an eyewitness who answered the reporter's questions, the incident began shortly before midnight when a large group of Italian sailors entered the Liddell Ballroom and one of them accidentally bumped into a Highlanders soldier sitting alone near the entrance. Another Italian soldier immediately picked up a bottle and struck the British soldier, causing a severe cut above his right eye. Two French sailors sitting nearby, along with two British and two American sailors, went over to confront the Italian soldiers, which triggered the fight. The Italian sailors, along with other Italian sailors who had arrived at the Liddell Ballroom earlier, grabbed nearby tables, chairs, and bottles and began to smash things. Other Italian soldiers fought with the British, French, and American sailors. Fortunately, several British non-commissioned officers were also in the ballroom and, seeing that the British soldiers were outnumbered, escorted them into the kitchen. Meanwhile, several Chinese and Russian bar girls sitting around the dance floor were slightly injured by flying bottles or chairs before they could escape to safety, and some fainted and were carried into the kitchen by other bar girls or British and American sailors. As the brawl intensified, the ballroom owner called the commander of the Italian San Marco unit for help. Soon after, a truck commanded by a senior Italian officer sped to the scene, stopped the Italian soldiers in the ballroom, and took them back to their barracks. According to investigations, three French sailors sustained serious facial injuries and were taken back to their barracks. Although British and American sailors all suffered cuts, their injuries were not severe. One bar girl was taken to the Country Hospital; her injuries are reportedly not life-threatening.

### "Clothes Stealing from Children" Gang; Another Arrest Made; Father Catches Perpetrator in the Act

Recently, gangs stealing clothes from children have been rampant in the concessions. The General Police Department previously apprehended one such perpetrator and recovered over a hundred pieces of children's clothing. The First Special District Court sentenced him to four years in prison. On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, at 5:00 PM, Dai Guanglin, a Nanjing native, saw a six-year-old child, Sun Xiangde (resident of 50 Beihai Road), playing at the entrance of Lane 35, Hubei Road. He was wearing a red wool sweater. Dai intended to steal the sweater. He lured the child into the lane with sweet words, gave him a piece of coffee candy, and was about to take off the child's clothes when the child's father, Sun Hongjiang, arrived while searching for him. He seized Dai and handed him over to Chinese Detective Zhang Bingchun, who took him to the Old Gate Police Station. Under questioning, Dai confessed that he was a member of the clothes stealing gang. The detective found a bag of coffee candy used to lure children in his pocket and recovered a piece of children's clothing that Dai had previously stolen from somewhere. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that the case needed further investigation to determine if Dai had committed other crimes, so he requested a postponement. After questioning him, Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered him to be remanded in custody pending further interrogation.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed gentlemen of the Shen Bao Newspaper Office: We have just read a news item in the news column of your newspaper on April 11 regarding a salesman from the Sincere Cosmetics Factory embezzling funds. We were very surprised to learn of this. Upon investigation, our factory has no one named Meng Daiyuan, and none of our staff members are surnamed Meng. As for the claim in your newspaper that the staff member was highly trusted by the factory's director, Mr. Xu Zhaohe, our factory's director is also not Mr. Xu Zhaohe. We believe that your reporter mistakenly printed the name of another factory as Sincere Cosmetics Factory, hence the error. We are hereby sending this letter to request a correction. With best wishes, Sincere Cosmetics Factory, April 11th.

### Weather Report

### Mosquitoes Are More Ferocious Than Tigers

— Ji Qian

Mosquitoes are harmful to humans because they can cause malaria and yellow fever. Countries with developed cultures in the world pay the most attention to this, making every effort to prevent it. Soldiers on the front lines of the Anti-Japanese War in our country suffer greatly from malaria, which hinders their combat effectiveness. This is something that the government and patriotic medical experts should correct and remedy. According to reports, more than 100 million people in India suffer from mosquitoes every year, and the government's annual loss is 8 million pounds. However, this only refers to the government's tax revenue, and the economic losses of the people themselves are not included in this calculation. What is even more noteworthy is that about 50 people in Siam are eaten by tigers in a year, while more than 50,000 people are bitten by mosquitoes and die from malaria. Under the government's efforts to prevent it, it is still like this. If the government and society do not pay attention and let it go, the magnitude of the harm can be imagined.

### Simple Wind Tests

— Ji Zhi

Wind is the most elusive thing. There is a saying "catching wind and grasping shadows," which is used to describe something illusory. However, wind is actually the easiest thing for humans to feel and has a very close relationship with human life and all flora and fauna. The greatest function of wind can be said to be the transmission of water vapor. Simply put, it is to transfer the water vapor evaporated from the surface of the ocean to the land. The second is to regulate the climate, so that the temperature on the ground is not too cold or too warm in various places. From a biological point of view, wind can help plants spread their seeds, which is what is called wind pollination. The miracle of wind is such that it is no wonder that ancient China thought that there was a "Wind God" to manage it!

In fact, the reason for wind is nothing more than the turbulence of the atmosphere. Why does the atmosphere need to be turbulent? That is because the heat of solar radiation causes the temperature on the ground to be different in different places, resulting in pressure differences. In addition, the Earth's rotation also has a considerable impact. Wind sometimes blows in only one direction, becoming a natural driving force for water navigation, which humans have long used. It can also be used to drive windmills for water pumping, grinding flour, and other work, which has also brought a lot of benefits to mankind. Another kind of strong cyclone, although it cannot be used, greatly threatens the safety of buildings, so engineers must know the situation of the wind before they can engage in design. In recent years, the aviation industry has developed, so not only the wind on the ground is of great importance, but also the wind in the high altitude cannot be ignored, because the wind in the high altitude is different from the wind on the ground.

Wind direction testing can generally be divided into (1) wind direction and (2) wind speed. Wind direction refers to the direction from which the wind is blowing. Usually, in cities or towns, there are fixed targets as a reference, and it is easy to see the movement of flags or smoke to determine it. Moreover, not only can the four directions of east, south, west, and north be used, but often southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest can be added to distinguish more accurately with eight directions. However, in the wilderness, it is inevitable that there will be some difficulties, so it is best to have a weather vane or a special flag for testing. However, the direction of the wind is not stable on a straight line. The so-called direction is only the average situation.

The magnitude of the wind refers entirely to the wind speed and has nothing to do with the wind direction. A large wind means that the speed of the wind is fast, or the pressure of the wind on an area is large. The pressure of the wind is directly proportional to the square of the wind speed, but it is not very accurate. For the safety of buildings, the magnitude of wind pressure or the speed of wind is the most important. It is more difficult to test the wind pressure. Usually, the wind speed is tested first, and then the wind pressure is calculated. There are many instruments for testing wind speed, and the details are extremely complicated, so I cannot describe them all here.

Now I will introduce a simple method of wind speed testing, called the Beaufort wind scale, which is listed in the table below. In the table, the magnitude of the wind is divided into thirteen levels, each level has a name, which is determined by the Central Meteorological Research Institute with reference to the original text. Beaufort was originally a nautical expert. Based on his experience, he distinguished the magnitude of the wind by the phenomena that occurred on land (there are other standards at sea), so the wind level can be determined without instruments. This testing method has long been adopted internationally, so it is often seen in the weather reports issued by the Xu Jiahui Observatory in our country, but only the level number is used without mentioning the name. The table also lists the corresponding wind speed (miles per hour) of each wind level, and other units can be calculated accordingly.

Beaufort Wind Scale

### Gas-Filled Light Bulbs

— Xin Jun

Since Edison invented the carbon filament light bulb in 1879, many people have continued to work hard to study how to improve the filament in the bulb, hoping to find a more durable filament. As a result, tungsten filament was found. Tungsten is also a metal, like gold, silver, copper, and iron, but people don't know much about it because it is very similar to tin. Dr. Coolidge of General Electric invented a new method of refining tungsten. Some people thought that the light bulb manufacturing industry had reached its peak. However, there are still various difficult problems that cannot be completely solved. For example, there is still a need to save electricity, and the bulb starts to turn black after it is used, and the light slowly decreases. Therefore, tungsten filament bulbs are indeed not very satisfactory. But no matter how hard you try, there is no considerable effect.

In the research laboratory of General Electric, many scientific experts spent a lot of effort and thought, seeking fundamental methods in scientific principles, and not just thinking about "treating the head when the head hurts and treating the foot when the foot hurts," and eventually benefited in practice.

The brittleness of the filament can indeed be solved by refining tungsten. However, the blackening of the bulb glass must be solved. So I thought that the vacuum in the bulb must have something to do with it. Therefore, I wanted to start by improving the manufacturing method of vacuum, but I hit a wall again. So I proceeded along two paths! One path was to investigate the source of gas in the bulb, and the other path was to seek the influence of various gases on the bulb.

Research results show that a little water vapor in the bulb makes the bulb easier to turn black. Because water vapor oxidizes tungsten and discharges hydrogen gas in atomic state. Tungsten oxide reaches the bulb and is changed by active hydrogen, restoring it to metallic tungsten. Hydrogen still combines with oxygen to form water. This cycle continues, thus sending the light bulb to its end.

The first experimenters - including Edison - had thought about using various gases to fill the light bulb. However, the results of the research showed that gas-filled light bulbs were not as good as the vacuum carbon filament bulbs that were popular at the time. Later experiments proved that if the tungsten filament is in a completely dry bulb and then heated to near melting (3370°), and at the same time it is filled with gas, the life of the filament is much longer than in a vacuum; and the heavier the gas used, the slower the evaporation of the metal, i.e., the tungstatization. It is true that adding gas can prolong the life of the light bulb. But at the same time, a lot of heat is lost.

The dense gas, like nitrogen or argon, which has never been used before, reduces the evaporation of the bulb filament at the same temperature, down to one percent of what it used to be in a vacuum. And because of the exchange effect of the gas, the tungsten oxide is brought to the top of the bulb and sinks, and it will not hinder the light.

Later, coiled filaments, which are made by coiling tungsten filaments into a spiral shape, were used, so that the temperature can be even higher, thus increasing the luminous efficiency and making the light emitted whiter.

The story described above shows that only through careful and thorough research can the commonly used light bulbs of today be obtained. Compared with the original carbon filament bulbs, there is a world of difference. Who would want to use old-fashioned light bulbs again?

### Using Radio to Guide Workers in Tunneling

— Rong Ren

Tunneling is a difficult project in modern architecture. However, the need for tunnels is increasing day by day for opening railways, laying water pipes, or building defensive works. All tunneling requires drilling in from both ends to achieve twice the result with half the effort. However, when drilling in from both ends, the direction must be extremely accurate, otherwise there will inevitably be a difference of a hair's breadth, resulting in a thousand miles of error. In the past, the determination of direction relied entirely on surveying instruments. The measurement and calculation were not easy, and the result could not be perfect. Now there is a kind of radio direction finder, which is enough to guide workers to move forward in the mountains, not to go astray, and to move forward in a straight line from both ends. Tunneling workers only need to follow the through-mountain radio to move forward to reach their destination. This method can reduce many of the difficulties of tunneling. The Florence River Tunnel in the United States, which passes through the rugged mountains with hard granite, is 13 miles long and is the longest tunnel in the world. Tunneling workers also used radio as a guide. The location where workers drilling in from both ends met in the mountains differed by only thirty-six thousandths of an inch. The magnitude of its effect can be imagined.

Use radio to guide workers in a straight line to dig tunnels

### Limiting Electrical Appliances That Violate Racing Orders

— Zhen

There is now an ingenious electrical appliance that issues racing orders, which is enough to limit racers from adhering to the sound of the gun and not rushing ahead. The wiring of this electrical appliance is very simple, as shown in the figure. When the racers are preparing to start, they need to press a pad with one hand. Each pad is connected in series by a wire to the gun in the hand of the commander, so his gun can only fire when each racer's hand is pressing on each person's pad. If one person lifts his hand before the order is given, the circuit will be interrupted and the gun will not fire. This can align the start time without the disadvantage of rushing ahead.

Invisible Airplane

The British Practical Mechanics magazine states that the country's aircraft experts recently tested a new material for making aircraft that can be used to make almost invisible aircraft. This material is transparent, like glass, but much stronger than glass, and can be molded into any shape using a specially made press. Military aircraft made of this material are extremely difficult to see in multiple lights, and it is even more difficult to see when it is flying over water and looking down at it from above. It is said that this secret material is as strong as any aircraft material currently used.

Iron Slag Can Be Made into Glass

Soda ash is an important raw material for making ordinary glass sheets or utensils. But in India, soda ash is relatively expensive. Therefore, after many tests, it has now been found that iron slag in steel mills can be used as a raw material for manufacturing ordinary glassware. When manufacturing, this iron slag needs to be assisted with syenite. It is said that the price of this ordinary glass produced in India can be reduced by 50%. This glass is now used for bottles, tiles, and other utensils.

Analysis of Tobacco Leaf Smoke

According to the results of a recent analysis of tobacco leaf smoke by a German food chemist, the combustion of tobacco leaves produces a mixture of gas and steam. The gas emitted is nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and unused oxygen. Other gases are also present, but in very small quantities. The steam, i.e., the real smoke, is emitted from the red-hot area. The formation of this steam is mostly due to the substances in the tobacco, i.e., resins and resin-like substances, higher hydrocarbons and nitrogen compounds, the most notable of which is nicotine. When this steam cools in the air, it generates a colloidal fog, a fog with water vapor condensed on solid particles. When the temperature reaches above 300 degrees Celsius, tobacco leaf smoke cannot exist because it has completely vaporized. After cooling, the fog reappears.

Malleable Iron

Dr. Vans Vogt of Berlin has recently invented a very soft iron that can be kneaded into any desired shape. Its manufacturing method is to place iron powder in a container filled with hydrogen gas, and process it at a very high temperature—1200 to 1300 degrees Celsius—to obtain this novel iron, which is sponge-like; then treat it with resin to prevent rust. This new material is extremely useful for repairing water pipes or oil pipes.

### University Students Reduced to Beggars

— Mao Lie

This is really shocking news, and it is also a serious problem: in Shanghai, university students, and even university graduates, have been reduced to beggars!

According to the International Relief Committee, the organization is conducting a detailed investigation into the reasons why they have been reduced to beggars in order to extend moral education and teach them productive skills. This is good. Before the results of the investigation are published, we will naturally not know the full picture of the reasons. But there are a few points that we can speculate on.

Of course, we all know that war is the biggest and most direct reason, leading to many employed people losing their jobs, and unemployed people being unable to find jobs, making them so poor that they have nowhere to go, so they have to be reduced to beggars. Some university students or university graduates cannot escape this net, so they have to act as "General Stretch-Hands." However, let's think again, can they, especially university students or university graduates, completely blame the war?

As far as university students or university graduates are concerned, we know that since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, many have rushed to the mainland to engage in practical national salvation work. Of course, there are inevitably some who originally had difficulty living in Shanghai. Why didn't these beggars go to the mainland?

It is of course difficult to maintain the original occupation in Shanghai, and it is of course not easy to find a suitable occupation, especially in this period of the Anti-Japanese War. Except for consumer organizations, all industries are depressed, and the idle talents can be said to be full of pits and valleys. But let us think, can such intellectuals really do nothing else but be beggars? Suppose they are strong, why don't they pull rickshaws or do other labor? If they are good at talking, why don't they become salesmen or waiters? If they can write, why don't they set up a fortune-telling stall or write letters for people? In short, why don't they make other plans besides being beggars? If being a beggar is still doable, what legitimate things can't be done?

I believe that a person's unemployment or joblessness is certainly related to the oppression of the external environment, but the internal lack of motivation of the individual is really very important. Suppose this person has a skill or only brute force that can be sold, but he can be loyal to what he does, have no bad habits, or decadent temperament, I can say that this person will definitely not be unemployed, and even if he is occasionally unemployed, he will definitely get a job easily. In other words, his relatives and friends, those who are related to him in his job, will definitely be willing to maintain him and help him. He will never be reduced to a beggar!

I dare not say that the reason why these university students or university graduates have been reduced to beggars is all because of their own sins; however, I believe that their own sins must be the biggest reason. One who creates one's own sins cannot live, not just as a beggar.

Therefore, I believe that: teaching productive skills is crucial, and providing moral education is also important!

### At Bai Tahe

— Tong Shouping

—A Record of Mobile Propaganda

A few streaks of white clouds are painted diagonally in the sky. The winter sun is so gentle; in a while, the fragile light is also obscured by white clouds.

The wind is blowing hard. Eight or nine young people had already gathered in front of the courtyard to prepare to depart. Everyone took the things they should use: four skill education guns, a white cloth flag.... The short line walked towards the predetermined destination - Bai Tahe - under the attention of passers-by.

The wind blew on us, and our ears were frozen red. Excited and impassioned songs echoed in the air. Passers-by, tenant farmers in the fields, all stared at us with surprised eyes.

"Go to Bai Tahe to see a play, it's free. We're starting our propaganda."

"Then we'll go - really?" Although they had a skeptical attitude, some people followed us involuntarily, walking a long way behind.

In a burst of shouts of "Defend our motherland" and "Support our supreme leader," our line circled this small town. The whole town was shaken, and many people walked into the streets. They were very excited and nervous, and some even raised their fists:

"Don't be a slave of a conquered country! We must resist to the end!" This call merged with us, and the surrounding air was agitated.

Mr. Chen, the principal of Bai Tahe Primary School, invited us from the street to his school. We rested for a while and drank a cup of hot tea.

"Your enthusiasm really makes people ashamed and admired!" The humble Principal Chen said with a smile: "I'm afraid you haven't eaten yet, so please have a meal here!"

"We ate early. We shouldn't have come here to disturb you, but for the convenience of propaganda, we have to ask Principal Chen for guidance."

"Don't dare, don't dare!" He turned to a student and said, "Go and tell them!"

We were comforted and silent.

"I'm very sorry!" Principal Chen is too polite, and he treated us so sincerely. We are very ashamed.

After resting for a while, we walked out of the school again. We formed three small teams and went to give speeches, post slogans, and sing songs. At the same time, we also told them:

"This afternoon, please stop working for half a day and come to the Doutian Temple. We will perform interesting civilized plays for you to watch." They responded with universal cheers.

It was afternoon, the sky was still very gray, and the wind was blowing even harder. Just at lunchtime, the large courtyard of the Doutian Temple was already filled with a crowd of people. Under their eager anticipation, we resolutely boarded the "Wan Nian Tai" that specializes in performing ancient plays. The things we should use were also taken up by the school staff on our behalf. After Comrade Ying's passionate speech, several scripts that we wrote ourselves, such as "Northeast Compatriots," "Muddleheads," and "Catching Traitors," were also performed successively under the joint efforts of the comrades, interspersed with singing. More and more audiences gathered below, forgetting their fatigue, and staring at us seriously with gritted teeth; they stood for four full hours.

The dark twilight gradually enveloped the gray-white sky. Under their calls for continued performances, we stopped performing in order to rush back to our base. The audience dispersed reluctantly, with satisfaction and anti-enemy emotions. We also brought back a harvest of excitement under the encouragement of Principal Chen, braving the north wind.

### Head-on Blow (Woodcut)

— Li Yishan

### Warrior

— Gao Xiaozhong

(1)

It was the time when the morning light was just beginning to appear.

A robust warrior stood solemnly on a mound of earth: a steel helmet, a long face, a military uniform. Standing straight.

Looking at his appearance: thick, black eyebrows, triangular eyes, a high nose, a large mouth, a dark brown forehead, and earthy red cheeks.

"Where are you from, old friend?"

"Me? I'm from the Northeast."

"How many years have you been away from home, old friend?"

"Six years, since that incident."

"Are your parents still alive?"

"..." Looking at his bitter face, one understood.

"Your wife...?"

"No!" He forced out the word "no," and anger blazed across his face.

"Old friend! Now you can take revenge!"

He bit his lip and nodded.

(2)

A fierce battle was raging on the plains.

Red fire, red blood, red insignia. Boom boom boom boom boom, earth-shattering cannons drew huge arcs of vacuum in the sky. Airplanes droned low overhead, machine guns stuttered incessantly around, forming great streaks of fire, and constant bombs exploded, tossing the earth into the sky: "Sizzle, sizzle... Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom," shouts of killing covered the wilderness: "Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill..." A torrent of iron and blood crashed past...

(3)

Let the sky be inlaid with red, let the grass drink fresh blood, and a bloody battle came to an end.

Anxiously going to see friends: faces radiant with a red glow, wide chests exposed, large eyes still filled with lingering excitement, some smiles.

Patting his bald head, and saying, "How was it?"

"Wonderful! I cut down eight in a row, so refreshing!" Touching the scar on his arm, he smiled.

### Defense Line

— Tingmei

The enemy has fled.

Before the defense line stained with blood,

We buried the remains of our comrades,

The abandoned guns, ammunition pouches,

We handed them over to the brothers who came after.

On this defense line, under the scorching sun,

We wiped away sweat with our sleeves;

We shivered in the wind and snow;

We also counted the stars on autumn nights,

And saw the magnificent earth with wildflowers.

We each dedicated our lives to the country,

Firmly believing that justice will be served,

And that tyranny must eventually be destroyed!

At that time, we will blow the horn of victory,

On this defense line where the bones of our comrades are buried.

### After-Talk

— Editor

We often see submissions that, when referring to China's population, use the figure "450 million." The meaning is correct, but the second "wan" (ten thousand) is superfluous. It should be written as "450 million." Otherwise, it becomes "40,000 ten thousands" plus "50 million."

Submissions also often use the phrase "old wine in new bottles," but "bottle" is incorrect. This phrase comes from the Bible, where the English word is "flask," originally translated as a "leather bag." Because new wine has a high expansive force, old leather bags are prone to rupture, so they are incompatible. A bottle, however, is very strong and hard, and has nothing to do with whether the wine is old or new.

### Reciting History

— Qinghou

I want to recite a bit of history, but I don't know if it will be annoying or not.

In the notes of Song people, one often sees the atrocities committed by the Jin and Yuan people when they invaded China. In addition to the "daily fare" of looting women and plundering property, there was also the trampling of China's old cultural relics. It is said that when the Jin people arrived in Qufu, they burned the Confucius Temple and even cursed the statues. The Yuan people not only burned several Confucius Temples in the same industry, but also took the scriptures to brush horses. — The former item probably comes from Zhuang Jiyu's "Chicken Rib Compilation," and the latter item I can't recall the source for a moment, but it is also in the notes of the people, and it is written in a customary manner.

However, the changes are really very fast. After the Jin people settled in northern China, they learned the old ways of the Chinese and also began to "select scholars through imperial examinations," and the subjects not only included Ci poetry but also the most important Classics. Although the Jurchen script was being promoted, they quickly translated the "Book of Documents." Although our scholars have always regarded this as ironclad proof of the assimilation of barbarians by Chinese culture, in fact, on the other hand, it was to enable those in positions of power to understand the old things of China so that they could be used as magic weapons to rule the Chinese people. As for the Yuan people after they had a "dynasty," that is even more well known: Confucius was also honored as "the Most Accomplished Sage and Teacher King of Culture," and the study of Confucianism was especially emphasized, and Zhu Xi suddenly became popular. Using the old things of China to conquer China, the methods became more thorough and more powerful.

It is just that our past scholar-officials are really worthy of admiration: seeing the invasion of foreign tribes, they were indignant; but their indignation at the trampling of old things seemed to be much more intense than their indignation at the massacre of large numbers of lives. And the invaders finally saw this spirit of ours, so when they sat firmly in power, they especially brought out our old things. And this immediately took effect, our scholar-officials not only forgot their previous indignation, but from then on wholeheartedly became the adopted sons of the new masters. — And, even to this day, some people still insist that Genghis Khan is our ancestor. Our loyalty to the Yuan dynasty has really been maintained for a long time.

After the Manchus entered the pass, what was the situation regarding the trampling of China's old cultural relics? Strangely, there are texts recording the Manchu massacres, but there seem to be very few texts recording the Manchu trampling of old cultural relics. Could it be that the Manchus were more civilized than the Jin and Yuan people? I don't think so. The Manchus were only more clever than the Jin and Yuan people, and more clear about our psychology. After they had a "dynasty," they used a lot of hard work in banning books and deleting books: for the achievements of "massacring cities" to boast of their own martial prowess, they sometimes even let some of them remain, but for the records of trampling old cultural relics that particularly made us feel disgusted, they probably "destroyed" them all. This is not just blind speculation. Just the passage about burning temples and cursing statues in the "Chicken Rib Compilation" mentioned above was revised and deleted by the Qing Dynasty. That was only talking about the Jin people, but the Qing Dynasty still had to revise and delete it, which shows that on the one hand, they had also done such things, and on the other hand, there is no doubt that they certainly would not leave a shadow of their own achievements in this regard.

And the Qing Dynasty was even more vigorous in promoting our old things. Confucius was promoted higher and higher, needless to say, "eight-legged essays" became the orthodox literature, and needless to say; just looking at the "Imperial Compilation" or "Imperially Approved" such-and-such "collection of commentaries" and "annotations" of the Classics, one can know the bustling scene. The effect of this time was even greater. Our scholar-officials were really so happy that they were all smiles, forgetting the countless "massacres of cities" in the past, forgetting many literary inquisitions, and filled their mouths with "Our Dynasty," "Our Dynasty." It didn't matter how "Our Dynasty" blessed and dominated us, because it could "investigate the past and value literature."

Looking down from history, our scholar-officials' love of restoring the old is really greater than their love of the nation. — Of course, on the surface, restoring the old is still restoring the "old" of the nation, but in practice, they often only recognize the "old" and do not recognize the nation. The invaders understood this very well, so their policy was always: just give you those "old" things. They knew that the more "old" things they gave you, the lower you would bend your waist and the louder you would kowtow.

Reciting history is naturally dry. My meaning is nothing else, just to say: restoring the old is not only not a weapon to save the nation, but on the contrary, it is a weapon for the invaders to destroy us.

### The Quality of the Exhibition of Chinese Paintings of Past Dynasties

— Shi Chongpeng

The more advanced a nation's culture is, the more urgent it feels for spiritual comfort. In primitive times, human knowledge was shallow, and the main needs were the supply of food and clothing. Apart from directly working for their food and clothing, they lived in groups and fought for dominance, with no spiritual response. As culture advanced, cruel fighting became an immoral expression, and monotonous life really needed adjustment. Thus, spiritual activities began: music, dance, poetry, painting, and all other arts emerged in response. Therefore, any nation where art flourishes is the earliest civilized country, the reason for this is clear, and there are many examples: in Europe and the West, it is Greece and Rome; in East Asia, it is our Chinese nation, whose culture and politics have formed a bright and brilliant history. And painting, in particular, is full of subtle principles, embellishing rites and systems, greatly assisting education, representing virtues and eulogizing merits, and everything from bronze tripods and ritual vessels relies heavily on painting. As for heavenly dragon treasures, hell transformation images, portraits of sages and worthies, and the works of meritorious ministers in the Unicorn Pavilion, they are deeply moving and cause people to reflect deeply, which is not only a success of painting, but also a great achievement of national culture. Moreover, its style is simple and profound, emphasizing brush and ink, respecting charm, emphasizing verisimilitude and expressiveness, and focusing on spirit and subtlety. Its tranquility and peace occupy the highest peak of world art.

Since painting has the function of educating and humanizing people, emperors of all dynasties have done their best to promote it, establishing official positions to manage it, and using painting to select scholars. Liu (Songnian), Li (Tang), Ma (Yuan), and Xia (Gui) carefully created masterpieces, which often came from the court style, which was rigorous and simple, and differed in its purpose from the Jiangnan landscapes and ink paintings of Dong (Yuan), Ju (Ran), Mi (Fu), and Guo (Xi). However, they were all only for the appreciation of a small number of emperors and aristocratic classes. Poor commoners had no way to even take a glimpse. Therefore, the value of painting could not be fully realized, and the significance of painting could not be widely revealed, which is a deep sigh! Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the Southern School has flourished, with Huang (Zijiu), Wang (Shuming), Ni (Yunlin), Wu (Zhonggui), Wen (Zhengming), Shen (Shitian), Dong (Qichang), and Tang (Liuru), who were light and elegant in their brushstrokes. Although the emperors favored it, the folk style was like water flowing downwards, implicitly revealing the trend of ideological liberation. Compared with the scholar-officials who were immersed in the eight-legged essay and did not know how to extricate themselves, the painters had already taken the lead in culture! During the Qing Dynasty, the Four Wangs (Yanke, Yuanzhao, Shigu, Lutai), Wu (Yushan), and Yun (Nantian) and others were not without outstanding works. However, from the Five Dynasties and the Two Songs to the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, how many famous masterpieces were there? Some were lost in water and fire, and some were destroyed in wars. Over the past thousand years, they have become as rare as morning stars. After the establishment of the Republic of China, although the Palace Museum was established based on the Qing Dynasty's collection, with exhibitions open for people to visit, it was only limited to one part and one place. The person in charge was unable to fully display its abilities, and there was much that should have been promoted, resulting in low efficiency and poor results.

In the past ten years, painting exhibitions have been held almost every year and everywhere, but they have all been fragmentary, with narrow collections and unfurnished displays. Even worse, there is a mix of fake and genuine items. It is impossible to find a systematic and valuable painting exhibition. The only ones are the National Art Exhibition of the Ministry of Education and the Shanghai preview of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art! Now, major domestic collectors, in view of this, have jointly launched the Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties in Shanghai. In the past, those who cherished their deep collections and were unwilling to easily show them to others are now exhibiting all their possessions publicly for the appreciation of the public. The meaning of this is profound, and the value is great, which need not be repeated. In terms of content, it is not inferior to the Shanghai preview of the previous London Art Exhibition; in terms of quantity, it surpasses the Shanghai preview. (According to the above, the calligraphy and painting section of the London Art Exhibition only had more than 200 pieces). However, when we are in the midst of the famous works of the ancients, while enjoying the scenery and pleasing our hearts, we should also seek the true meaning in the brush and ink of the writers of the past, in addition to their skills, their moral cultivation, and the forging of their character. We should also realize this great national spirit, strengthen our beliefs, and encourage our future, in order to be loyal to our country and nation! As for the excellence of the exhibits, I will discuss them in another article.

### After Visiting the Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties at the Great World Company

— Fo

Recently, there have been so many calligraphy and painting exhibitions that one is almost overwhelmed, like on the Shanyin Road. However, the "Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties" is so remarkable that, except for the exhibition held in Shanghai when the calligraphy and painting of the Palace Museum were transported to London for display the year before last, this is probably the first time.

There are two differences between this calligraphy and painting exhibition and ordinary calligraphy and painting exhibitions: (1) Ordinary calligraphy and painting exhibitions are commercial in nature and are entirely for the purpose of personal rights, while this exhibition is all non-sales items. The proceeds from the tickets are all given to the Shanghai Medical Association for medical relief. One is a commercial exhibition, and the other is a charitable exhibition. Their meanings are very different. (2) Ordinary calligraphy and painting exhibitions are aimed at making profits, so the calligraphy and paintings listed are a mixture of genuine and fake, good and bad, and even there is not a single item worth seeing. However, the calligraphy and paintings listed here are mostly valuable works sent by several major collectors for display at the exhibition. Since there is no intention to make a profit, there must be no intention to deceive people with counterfeit goods. If they are willing to provide exhibitions, they must be fine works and masterpieces. Therefore, the calligraphy and paintings listed are naturally different from ordinary exhibitions.

The calligraphy and paintings displayed this time are all representative works of various eras and masters from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Appraisers and collectors have long established evaluations of these works. There is no need for me to add to the praise. However, since the loss of collectors in various war zones after the fall of the various war zones is naturally immeasurable, and the number of antiques and calligraphy and paintings has suddenly decreased sharply, antiques and calligraphy and paintings must inevitably become historically famous and valuable. However, the collectors who were able to carefully collect and preserve the calligraphy and paintings of the past dynasties so that they would not be destroyed are already rare and valuable. Now, they are able to display the items that they have carefully collected and preserved for the appreciation of the world. This is an even more rare and great act, so artists and art lovers in the world must not miss it. Moreover, aesthetic concepts are originally shared by all human beings, and compassion is also a human sympathy, so even if they are not connoisseurs, they also have the necessity to go together and feast their eyes.

Although I am a layman in the field of calligraphy and painting, I have also caught a glimpse of it. Let's not talk about calligraphy, let's talk about painting. There are many schools of painting in our country, and it is impossible to investigate them all. There are the Northern School, the Southern School, the paintings of Confucian scholars, the paintings of painters, the paintings of the Academy School, and the paintings of non-Academy School. However, although there are many schools, they are all based on the eight methods, and among the eight methods, there are only two methods, namely brush and ink. For example, in arithmetic, there are many names, and there are thousands of changes, but in fact, there are only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Multiplication is addition, and division is subtraction. The result is only addition and subtraction. Recently, painters have also been divided into two schools, one is Western painting, and the other is Chinese painting. Western painting is realism, and Chinese painting is idealism. Although their positions are different, Chinese painting emphasizes brush and ink, and Western painting emphasizes lines, light and shadow. Lines are brushes, and light and shadow are ink. The names are different, but the principles are the same. Therefore, if Chinese painting does not have the realism of Western painting, it cannot be called a famous painting. If Western painting does not have the ideal spirit of Chinese painting, it cannot be called a masterpiece.

In the early Qing Dynasty, the Four Wangs, Wu Yun, and Yun Nantian were known as masters, and Wu Mojing slightly adopted Western methods in his later years, and future generations inevitably had criticisms. The Italian Lang Shining used Western painting to participate in the methods of Chinese painting, and eventually became a master. In recent times, the paintings of Cheng Yaosheng, Wu Shixian, etc., also slightly participated in Western methods, and people have also praised them a lot. Chinese painting has its advantages, and Western painting has its advantages, but Chinese painting and Western painting originally belong to the same principle. Western painting should be realistic, and why doesn't Chinese painting emphasize realism? Chinese painting values ideals, and why doesn't Western painting value ideals?

I am neither a Chinese painter nor a Western painter. When I visited the calligraphy and paintings listed in the exhibition, from the Tang and Song dynasties to the Manchu Qing, most of them were representative masterpieces of various masters of various eras. From this, I saw the changes in Chinese painting over the past thousands of years, and I can see that although there are many schools of Chinese painting, there has never been anyone who can become a famous artist without paying attention to the brush and ink. If there is, it is a vulgar stream of Jianghu. Because I visited this "Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties," I had some feelings, so I wrote this in a disorganized way.

### The Authenticity and Identification of Calligraphy and Painting

— Pan Boshan

There are few genuine works of calligraphy and painting by famous people throughout the ages, and the supply cannot meet the demand, and the creation of forgeries is becoming more and more frequent. The high-quality ones can confuse the real ones, and even those with decisive skills are enough to meet the market. Therefore, genuine and fake products are mixed, and even collectors cannot avoid the feelings of Li Qiu. I once read Sun Yuefeng's inscription on Shen Shitian's landscape album, which said: "There are many forgeries of this old man, but I have also seen one or two genuine works from collectors." He also inscribed on Wen Hengshan's poetry and painting scroll: "The ancients said that if you want to see Hengweng's calligraphy and painting, you must enter his studio and ask him to make them in person in order to get good ones and no forgeries. Now I see this is indeed the case." An Shifeng's inscription on Tang Liuru's Fallen Flowers Scroll in Molin Kuai Shi also said: "I have collected enough paintings by Bohu to fill a room, but they are all forgeries. Only one single scroll and one long scroll are genuine." Sun An was a master of appraisal, and he was less than a hundred years away from Shen Wen Tang. What he saw, collected, and said was still like this. Today, three hundred years have passed since Sun An, and it is difficult to seek genuine products from among ten thousand or one hundred thousand.

I collected a letter from Hengshan to Qian Shubao that said: "There are four fans, please paint them. One should be lightly colored, and the rest only need to be lightly inked. Do not sign them, and set a deadline of three days." I also saw Wang Shigu's letter to Gu Ruotong that said: "Danweng's long scroll is urgently waiting to be colored. Zihe has already embellished the figures and houses." Shen Xuez's inscription on Xiang Gongfu's painting of plum blossoms said: "I heard that old Dongxin is living as a guest, and he charges directly for each silk painting. How can I know that they are all made by my brother? It's a pity that no one recognizes the counterfeit products." It can be known that most of Dongxin's paintings of plum blossoms were made by Gongfu on his behalf. Now, the vulgar eye does not observe, values gold and despises Xiang. It is known that since ancient times, famous artists have often had substitutes under their doors, which is a common practice. It is really difficult to speak of distinguishing between genuine and fake products when brush and ink are passed down.

In the past, great writers often played with Samadhi, imitating famous brushes to deceive the world. Looking at the famous works of Xi Xian, most of them are forgeries of Mi Zhao. The predecessors have already discussed this in detail. With the buttocks method of Mi Zhao, imitating Yi Xian from a thousand years ago, how can the vulgar eyes be able to distinguish them?

There are three points to discuss about forgeries of calligraphy and painting: (1) works made by friends and brothers on behalf of the artist; (2) works forged at the same time; (3) works imitated by later generations. Imitation is the easiest to identify, forgery at the same time is more difficult to distinguish, but if it is a work on behalf of the artist, the imitated brush and ink must be similar, and the seal used must be the same. If one is not well-versed in research, how can one meet with the eyes?

So, how can the authenticity of calligraphy and painting be distinguished? I say: The texture of silk and the luster of ink should be studied to the extreme using scientific methods; Times change, and brush and ink change, so the truth should be obtained with an academic eye; But this is not enough to fully distinguish the ability. Calligraphy and painting are the same as poetry and prose, so they express the spirit of man. The spirit is entrusted to the brush and ink, and where the brush and ink reach, the spirit remains. The character of people is different, so their calligraphy and painting also differ in interest with the pen. Although it is a slight point and a slight brush, fathers, sons, teachers, and friends cannot seem to be the same. The gist is neither a vacuous word to be understood nor is there physical evidence to be proven. Reading extensively and thinking deeply, if you enlighten and understand, you will not make any mistakes in the difference between genuine and fake calligraphy and painting.

The genuine works of the Jin and Tang dynasties are far away. Most of the famous pens of the two Song dynasties were collected in the inner government, and they were as rare as stars in the outside world. In the past, I only imagined and understood them based on the imitations of later generations and the biographies, and got a general idea. After the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, the heavenly palace changed hands. The treasures of the Forbidden City were frequently exhibited, so that since the two Song dynasties, the famous ink treasures and paintings of Mount Lu finally revealed their true faces to the world, and the art forest has a true understanding, and the identification has also developed in a new way.

In recent times, the art of collotype printing has been invented, and public and private collections have followed suit and circulated the images. The fine versions are only one level below the genuine works. Although silk and ink colors cannot be fully transmitted, the general meaning of the ancients' use of the pen is enough for research. Is this not a great blessing for collectors?

In recent times, collectors have changed their old habits of secret play and have exhibited their collections one after another for the appraisal of their peers. Those who love the ancient and are quick to seek, since they have genuine works to compare, and then have printed copies for reference, then all the silk ink colors, and the ancient people's pen and pen interests, have clues to find, and the heart understands the spirit, and the authenticity is not difficult to distinguish.

Painting flourishes in the Tang Dynasty, prospers in the Song Dynasty, and is great in the Yuan Dynasty. The Tang Dynasty values quality, the Song Dynasty values literature, and the rationality is still incomplete. When the Yuan Dynasty succeeded, it washed away the traces of carving in the Tang and Song Dynasties, discarded its dross, and extracted its essence. Therefore, the imagery is transcendent, the technique advances to the Tao, and the secrets of heaven and earth's creation are revealed without loss through the brush. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, although talented people have emerged, they only narrated but did not create, and in the end, they are suspected of building houses under houses. Those who talk about sound occasionally say that poetry has been done by predecessors, so is painting not also the same? If you want to find the leader in the art world, you must return to the Yuan Dynasty. Let's take the works of the Yuan Dynasty in the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties as an example, such as the orchids and bamboos of the Zhao family (Zhao Mengfu and Zhao Yong), Huang Zijiu's Jiufeng Snow Clearing; Wang Shuming's Winter Green Thatched Cottage, Secluded Residence in the Forest; Ni Yunlin's Green Water Garden; Ma Wenbi's The Poetic Meaning of Mo Yun; Fang Fanghu's Youxing of Stream Bridge; Guo Tianxi's Yunshan; Wang Guyun and Zhang Shuhou's White Sketch of Revealing Bowl Picture and Nine Songs, all are majestic, resolute, broad, and large, profound, elegant, Hun, and Mu. The majestic and resolute are vast and forward, refined, fierce, and strong, and the broad and large stare at the nine heavens and wander through the ages. The profound and elegant are free from vulgarity, and the Hun and Mu gather all the edges. All of these gentlemen have these several beauties, and some are slightly biased in their strengths. Zhao Songxue and his son, Guo Tianxi, Ma Wenbi, Wang Guyun, and Zhang Shuhou are immersed in the profound, elegant, Hun, and Mu; Huang Zijiu, Wang Shuming, and Fang Fanghu are close to the majestic, resolute, broad, and large; If Ni Gaoshi's a wisp of stone, short bamboo, sparse, seems to be a kind of light and ease, but carefully taste its majestic and broad place, I feel that Huang Wang and several others should also give way a step, and it is worth bowing down. Examining the deeds of the gentlemen, whether they are officials and gentlemen, or strange scholars and high sages, all can read thousands of books and travel thousands of miles. When they pick up the topic, they stretch out the paper and wave the brush, they have bamboo in their chest and no whole cow in their eyes. The so-called pen has not reached the point where the gas has swallowed it, so it can be complete in spirit and intention, and the opportunity is wanton. How can vulgar craftsmen and lowly craftsmen describe their heads and draw their corners? Therefore, it is said that since the Yuan Dynasty came out, the painting path was completed, since the Yuan Dynasty came out, the painting path was exhausted, and since the Yuan Dynasty, future students and late scholars could not jump over its grasp. I was born hundreds of years after the Yuan Dynasty, and I was fortunate to have a quick view of its surviving pictures and wonderful traces. I was also born hundreds of years after the Yuan Dynasty, and I will eventually be a cattle and horse walking, and I will bow my head and lower my heart, and I will not be able to shake myself in the seat at the end of the painting garden. This is a discussion on Yuan Dynasty painting.

### The Entire Shanghai Film Industry Should Participate in the Charity Bazaar Movement

— Hai Yi

— Contributing a Few Concrete Suggestions Here

I heard that the International Red Cross Society is launching a large-scale charity bazaar movement in the next few days. The scope it encompasses is broad, meaning that any kind of business should donate one day's business or a portion of its income to the charity bazaar movement on that day. If such a movement can truly be opened up universally, then this charity bazaar movement will certainly achieve excellent results.

As for all the funds from the income, it has been stipulated that they will be entirely allocated to refugee relief. People in the rear, like those in Shanghai, should make more of an effort in the charity bazaar movement, as they should.

In addition to the industrial and commercial sectors, students, and the press all collectively participating in this charity bazaar movement, we also harbor the same ardent hope for the Shanghai film industry.

I think that Chinese film practitioners and film producers and theater owners who are slightly concerned about the war in the motherland and the refugees in various places will definitely participate in this movement more enthusiastically than anyone else.

I believe that the film industry should participate in this charity bazaar movement in three ways:

First, participation as individual film practitioners. Here, every male and female film practitioner, from actors and directors to cinematographers and set designers, should participate in this movement. I think there can be several ways to do this: (1) Autograph books of male and female stars and directors. Autograph books with photos would be even better. Get all the male and female actors and directors in the company to sign their names as quickly as possible, and then set a price, how much each autograph book will sell for. (2) Photos of male and female stars signed in their own handwriting, and they can be inscribed at any time; (i.e., the name of the person buying the photo) (3) Embroidery and handicrafts by female stars, such as handkerchiefs and pillowcases; (4) Artistic works by male and female actors, directors, set designers, and cinematographers, such as paintings, sculptures, set models, and cinematographers taking photos for people using film techniques, etc. With so many movie fans in Shanghai, people will definitely be eager to buy them to help the refugees.

Second, participation as a company or group. It is hoped that the film industry can participate in Peking opera, spoken drama, and various entertainment performances on the day of the charity bazaar movement. Stars usually participate in performing plays when celebrating birthdays or weddings, and it is even more their duty to do so on the day of the charity bazaar movement. At the same time, all male and female actors can sell a kind of commemorative badge for the film industry's charity bazaar movement. Male and female stars will personally wear the badge for the buyer (or give away a flower), which will surely encourage customers to buy it.

Third, film producers and theater owners must cooperate to donate all the theater's income on this day to the charity bazaar movement. Film companies and theater owners stipulate that everyone will not split the profits, for example, "Mulan Joins the Army" by Hu Guang, "A Chronicle of the Film City" by Xin Guang, "Wu Zetian" by Jin Cheng, etc., and the four major cinemas such as Da Guangming must participate in this charity bazaar movement. The income from all the large and small Chinese film merchants' cinemas in Shanghai is also quite considerable.

If the above points can be implemented, then I think the film industry itself can be considered to have done its part for the country and the nation; and if the refugees can get a little education and the opportunity to learn production skills from this, this is also what the film industry people want to give.

We hope that this movement can be launched immediately, because time is very tight, and the several film companies and enthusiastic film practitioners in Shanghai should launch it immediately and put it into practice right away.

As for the employees of the American-owned China United Film Company, they are all Chinese, and their patriotic enthusiasm will certainly not lag behind others, so their participation in this charity bazaar movement is certainly a matter of duty.

We are waiting for the launch of this movement, and at the same time, the public opinion circles will certainly be willing to make the greatest efforts to promote and publicize this movement!

### Glimpses of the Silver Screen

— (Sha)

Zhang Shichuan recently directed "Li Sanniang" for Guohua, scheduled to start filming tomorrow. It is said that Zhang plans to resume the Star Film Production in the autumn, as the company will be registered in Hong Kong.

The day before Chen Yunshang left Shanghai, Tong Yuejuan specially gifted a diamond ring worth 1,700 yuan (actual price). The rumor of 17,000 yuan is inaccurate.

The film industry in the occupied areas is very active. Previous productions of various companies have been pirated and screened. Silent films are sold for about 200 yuan each.

Liu Zhonghao, manager of Jincheng and producer of Guohua, has been busy recently with the publicity plan for "Tears of Song." The big picture should be visible after the 15th of this month.

Huang Jiamo's "Three Musketeers" movie song has been recorded by Pathé Records. This is his debut work and will definitely have gimmicks.

Bu Wancang is practicing frugality and has sold his car. Wu Yonggang also has news of going to Hong Kong.

Gong Qiuyun is now surrounded by various film companies, all wanting to sign a long-term contract with her. It is said that Ms. Gong's proposed conditions emphasize directors and scripts. It remains to be seen which company will hire her.

Wu Cun will return to his hometown with his family, saying he has no intention of staying in the isolated island film scene.

Jin Yan's Lin Chong, some people say he looks like a "guerrilla captain."

### News from the Pear Garden

Ma Lianliang Rushes to Rehearse New Play

Ma Lianliang is currently performing at the Xin Xin Theater in Beiping, with other roles played by Zhang Junqiu, Xiao Changhua, Li Duokui, etc. He has successively rehearsed "Qingfeng Pavilion," "Su Wu Grazing Sheep," "Ronghua Ji," and "Fishing for a Golden Turtle," and business is quite prosperous. Recently, Ma also invited Wu Huansun to write a new play for him, "Ten Old Men Comfort Liu." Wu was originally a famous playwright in China, and his relationship with Ma has always been very close. This decision to rush to write this play is extremely energetic. It is said that the content has a unique flavor. There are ten old men teasing each other in the play, which is truly unprecedented in the Peking opera world. The allocation of roles is indeed a problem, because all ten bearded roles in the play must be played by hard-line old men. Ma originally planned to teach and hire Ye Shenglan, Ma Fulu, Liu Lianrong, etc. to play the roles, but Ye Ma Liu and the three are now performing at the Shanghai Golden Grand Theater, so the plan has been changed. Jiang Miaoxiang, Xiao Changhua, Yuan Shihai, etc. have been decided to join. All the costumes used in the whole play have been researched and are not perfunctory. As for the makeup, expert Weng Ouhong has been specially invited to draw it, and Ma himself has also obtained two extremely precious ones from the Shengping Office. According to the news obtained by my friend Mr. Ren, when the play is performed, in the last scene, ten bearded men appear on stage at the same time, which is infinitely interesting and truly unprecedented.

Shang Xiaoyun Newly Accepts Disciple

Shang Xiaoyun is still as popular as he used to be. He is currently leading Shang Changchun, Shang Fuxia, Wang Fengqing, Fan Baoting, Song Yuchun, etc. to perform at the Zhonghe and Chang'an theaters in Beiping. The plays include "Bandits of the Water Margin," "Nine Yang Bells," "Opening the Mountain Mansion," "Modengjia Girl," and "Lanling Daughter," etc. Zhonghe performs night plays, and Chang'an performs day plays. Last month, with the introduction of a famous qin master, he accepted Kunling Li Huijun as a disciple. The official apprenticeship ceremony was held at Shang's residence, and a banquet was held that evening to entertain people from all walks of life, which was extremely grand for a time.

Yan Jupeng's Voice Recovered

Yan Jupeng, a famous bearded actor and top performer in the old Tan school, used to be considered imperfect by the general public because of his weak voice. Recently, his voice has completely recovered, and he can fully develop the Tan style. During the old lunar new year, he performed in Dalian, and the box office has remained strong. Later, he went to Harbin to be hired by the local Huale Grand Theater, and decided to rehearse Tan school's signature plays such as "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao," and "Ascending to Heaven," "Hongyang Cave", etc. The prosperity of the business broke the record that Harbin has never had before. He may come to Shanghai in May of this year.

Tan Fuying recruits Qingyi

Tan Fuying has been working very hard recently to recruit powerful Qingyi roles. The reason is of course because he feels that his signature plays such as "Visiting the Mother" and "Entering the Palace Twice" cannot be supplemented and fully develop his strengths. Last month, the Tianjin China Grand Theater specially invited Tan Fuying and Zhang Junqiu to cooperate in performing. The business was very prosperous, and the appeal was really considerable, and "Entering the Palace Twice" and "Catching and Releasing Cao" were the most popular. After Tan decided to co-star with Zhang this time, he admired her art so much that he even invited her as a friend, and then asked someone to discuss with Zhang's teacher Li Lingfeng. The future is promising.

Zhang Junqiu is about to get married

The marriage problem of Zhang Junqiu has been noisy for a while in the past, but later it became silent. Recently, according to news from people close to Zhang, Junqiu will marry the eldest daughter of a famous qin master. The date is in the middle of August this year's lunar calendar. The combination of this marriage is also very interesting. It is said that the matchmaker is Zhang's stepmother, the wife of a famous dan.

According to a letter from a gentleman in Beiping, Li Shaochun has recently rehearsed a monkey opera called "Sun Wukong Captures Demons and Pacifies Bandits." The content of the play has many gimmicks, and it is much more advanced than the various monkey operas performed in the past. There is also a play called "Golden Leopard", which has real and fake Pigsy, and adds a lot of humorous singing and dialogues. It is the same as Yu Shuyan and Wang Youchen's Stealing Soul Bell in the past, and it is a formal play with bones. The flying fork in the play is also one of the most exciting parts, because the weapon used by the Golden Leopard is exactly the flying fork. Shaochun's flying fork is a unique skill, so when he performs, he will definitely arouse the audience's interest.

### A Quick Sketch of the Public Rest Amateur Peking Opera Rehearsal

— Ticket Detective

The Public Rest Amateur Peking Opera Research Society organized by the Four Banks Savings Society specially borrowed the auditorium of the Guber Apartment for the third rehearsal during the Qingming holiday on the 8th and 9th. Famous ticket holders such as Hu Zhongwen, Fan Taofu, Pang Bingxia, Xu Jifang, and Sun Minhou all have wonderful performances. Here is a brief note of what I saw after watching.

I arrived at the Guber Apartment at about 8 o'clock last night. As soon as I entered the door, I saw a crowd of people and felt that I would have no place to stand. The capacity of this auditorium is quite large. Half of it is used as a stage, and half of it is arranged with seats. The decoration is magnificent, which is very rare. At that time, the second act of Ascending to Heaven was being performed on the stage. Guan Yaoqi's appearance was majestic and his voice was loud and clear, which was very suitable. The third act, Hongni Pass, was played by Pan Jingmei as the maid, and Sun Minhou as Wang Bodang and Yu Qianqiu as Dongfang, which had the beauty of peony and green leaves; Pan's appearance was extremely beautiful, slightly like Dr. Mei, and her voice was clear and sweet. The song from the section 26 was very pleasant to listen to with its ups and downs; (I think that if this gentleman can strive for further study, the future is limitless) Yu's acting is skilled and her appearance is also beautiful, but her eyes are too enchanting, which is inevitable excessive, and is criticized by those who know. It is said that Pan and Yu are making their debut for the first time, and it is not easy to have such achievements. As for Sun Minhou's Wang Bodang, he is Ye Shenglan in the ticket world. His singing and acting are well-established and have won a lot of applause from the audience. The fourth act is Miss Zhu ××'s June Snow. Her appearance is very beautiful, but her voice is low and narrow, which is a pity. The finale is Zhulian Village, Fan Taofu as Li Keyong, who is a famous ticket holder. The duet with Cheng Jingsi is a masterpiece, and is truly a perfect match. The audience often applauded. Zhu Boping's Cheng Jingsi has a bright and easy voice. It is heard that this gentleman has been instructed by the famous actor Yan Jupeng, which is probably not false. Sun Minjun's Grand Taibao and Xu Jifang's Second Imperial Concubine are full of wonderful performances, which add a lot of color to the play. Because it was late at night, I returned without waiting for the end of the show, and it was a pity that I did not see the whole picture.

Furthermore, the Qin ticket holders Shen Yanxi Zhu Shuping Zhongping brothers, this decision to play, the fingering is pure and sweet, and the power of the Mei school, the good cavity is full of, which is really rare, which is worth praising.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (143)

— Xu Muyun

A Strange Wind Helped Li Zhuangyuan During the Palace Examination

The other day, because of the second play of "Thirteen Sisters," I talked about Nian Gengyao's seat master, Li Pan; To talk about the family background of Li Zhuangyuan, it is indeed very related to the word "karma" said by Buddhists. Li Pan's grandfather, Mr. Li Xiangyang, was admired by the people for his learning and morality. When Emperor Xizong of Ming Dynasty (Tianqi) was in power, the eunuch Wei Zhongxian monopolized power, and shrines were built for him everywhere, and his power was prominent. The power of the court was completely controlled by Wei Yan. At that time, Mr. Xiangyang's literary name was already known all over the world, but because he witnessed the difficulties of the time, he knew that the country's fortune was already in danger, so he lived in seclusion in his hometown and was unwilling to become an official. Wei Zhongxian admired Mr. Xiangyang's literary talent and had three resolutions to recruit him into the capital, and tempted him by saying: "As long as Mr. comes to the north, the first place in this imperial examination will definitely belong to you." Mr. Xiangyang refused all three times. From this, we can know how noble his personality is. Later, the Ming Dynasty had fallen, and he secretly plotted with Wan Nian Shao and Yan Gugu and other late Ming Dynasty remnants to restore the Ming Dynasty; However, the general trend was gone, and it could not be saved by a few people, so he, the old gentleman, also lived in seclusion with Wan. Yan and others.

Mr. Xiangyang's son, Li Yan, was also a learned scholar. When he had nothing to do at home, he taught his son Li Pan to study poetry. During the Kangxi period, the country was at peace, and in order to win people's hearts, the Manchus wanted to select the descendants of loyal ministers of the Ming Dynasty to become officials in the court, in order to reduce the forces of anti-Manchu restoration; Therefore, Li Pan was specially favored by them and selected as the top Zhuangyuan.

According to the elders in Xuzhou who have seen Li Pan's family letters, his high school that day was really too lucky. Li Pan was obese. During the palace examination, everyone else had finished their papers, but he was still kneeling there alone, writing. The more anxious he was, the more he could not write. Suddenly, he was so anxious that he was sweating and his mind was confused. He didn't even know what he had written on the paper. Unexpectedly, at this moment, a strange wind suddenly blew up, and the sky was dark; According to the past practice of the palace examination, since a considerable amount of time has passed and the paper has not been completed, the paper should be taken away and he should be driven down the palace. I don't know what kind of relationship Emperor Kangxi had with the Li family. Not only did he not take his examination paper, but he also issued an order to light red candles and set up a screen under the palace, ordering Li to complete the examination paper inside the screen before removing it. Such a rare anecdote of treating scholars with such preferential treatment is probably very rare in ancient and modern times.
