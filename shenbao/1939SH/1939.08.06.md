### Hunanese Troops Gain More Ground; Capture Minggang, Xiaolindian, Sanguanmiao; Chinese Army Pursues Victory, Reaches Changtaiguan, Encircles Defeated Japanese Troops; Changzhi in Eastern Shanxi Also Recaptured, Japanese Troops Retreating Towards Liangma

(Luoyang) Frontline telephone report: After the recapture of Minggang, the Chinese army pursued the victory. On the morning of the 4th, they captured Sanguanmiao and swept towards Changtaiguan from "south of Minggang." The Japanese troops at Wushengguan, in order to coordinate with the northern front, occupied Gaocheng, north of Suixian, on the afternoon of the 4th, and a part besieged Lishan. The Chinese army has already launched counterattacks along different routes. (5th dispatch)

(Luoyang) The war situation in southern Henan: Since the Chinese forces completed their deployment and launched a full-scale offensive, they have been winning victories. On the 2nd, the Chinese army attacked Minggang, where fierce hand-to-hand combat occurred near the railway station. On the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attacks and retreated in a disorganized manner towards Changtaiguan. The Chinese army immediately recaptured Minggang. The citizens saw the national flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun flying in the sky again, and they rejoiced along the streets, like children returning to the embrace of their loving mother. While comforting the people, the Chinese army pursued the retreating Japanese troops. The Japanese troops stationed at Xiaochengtian (west of Xinyang) were forced to retreat to Zhe River (east of Xiaolindian) after a determined attack by the Chinese army. At this moment, there were no Japanese troops in Xiaolindian. However, the Japanese troops previously defeated by the Chinese army at Huaihedian had retreated east and west in two directions. The 3,000 to 4,000 Japanese troops retreating west had crossed the Sandao River (northeast of Gaocheng in Suixian) and their vanguard had reached Xinshuiguan and Yinjiadian (both northeast of Gaocheng in Suixian). Another unit had reached Jiuligang (northwest of Gaocheng). It seems that the Japanese troops were attempting to detour around the side of Tongbai Mountain, and the Chinese army has taken strict precautions. (4th dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, Minggang Station on the Pinghan Railway in southern Henan has been recaptured after fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese forces yesterday. The Japanese troops retreated towards Changtaiguan, and the Chinese army has now advanced to Changtaiguan and surrounded the Japanese troops. At the same time, a large part of the city walls west of the Pinghan Railway has also been recaptured by the Chinese army. With this victory, the Japanese plan to capture southern Henan has been shattered. On the southern front of Shanxi Province, as a result of the Chinese army's continued counterattacks, Jincheng has been surrounded. It is reported that there are 2,000 Japanese soldiers guarding Jincheng. If Jincheng returns to the hands of the Chinese army, it can be said that the Japanese army's offensive against the Taihang Mountains will be a complete failure, because the Japanese troops north of Jincheng have all withdrawn north after the Chinese army recaptured more than a dozen important towns, so the Japanese troops in Jincheng have become isolated. At the same time, the Japanese troops on the Gaoping-Duanshi Highway have also been completely cleared. In Anhui Province, although Huaiyuan was recaptured by the Chinese forces in the middle of last week, after a fierce counterattack by the Japanese cavalry and artillery, the Chinese army retreated again. (5th Associated Press dispatch)

Fancheng: Recently, the Japanese troops launched fierce attacks on Chinese positions such as Qilitang, and the battle situation was extremely fierce. Two platoons of Chinese soldiers guarding Qilitang died heroically, and more than 100 Japanese soldiers were also killed or wounded. For the past three days, fierce battles have been raging in the mountains near Bijiashan, Qilitang, and Gaocheng. On the 4th, more than 400 Japanese troops attempted to encircle the Chinese positions by detouring around the above-mentioned areas. The Chinese army is determined to sacrifice themselves and has not wavered, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese. Another Japanese force that attacked Lishan from Suixian was intercepted by the Chinese army in the Sujiafu area on the left flank of Lishan. The Jiangjiahe market town has been lost and regained twice and is currently still under Chinese guard. (5th dispatch)

(Luoyang) Since the war in southern Shanxi turned to eastern Shanxi, both Chinese and Japanese forces have been actively deploying. The Japanese army plans to harass Licheng, but has not yet launched an attack. The Chinese army took preemptive action with a night attack on the 1st against the garrison of over a thousand Japanese soldiers at Huguan. The Japanese were caught off guard and many were killed by the Chinese army. The Chinese army destroyed the Japanese fortifications and returned to their original defenses at dawn. Huguan is only thirty miles away from Changzhi. After this attack, the Japanese troops were all terrified. On the morning of the 1st, a unit of the Chinese army launched a swift attack on Changzhi, a Japanese base. The Japanese troops stubbornly resisted, and bullets rained down. The brave Chinese soldiers gave their lives and charged forward with all their might. The fierce battle lasted all day, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army finally braved the dense artillery fire and broke into the city walls. Without any street fighting, the Japanese troops collapsed to the east. Thus, Changzhi, an important stronghold in eastern Shanxi, was once again in the hands of the Chinese army. In addition, the Japanese troops at various strongholds along the Hongtun Highway have been shaken by the continuous attacks from the north and south by the Chinese army. On the 31st, a unit of 700 to 800 Japanese troops from Tunliu retreated west through Liangma (west of Tunliu), and all the Japanese troops from Zhangdian Town (west of Tunliu) also retreated to Liangma. The Japanese army's attempt to maintain traffic on the Hongtun Highway has failed, and their attempt to open a route from Linfen to Dongyangguan is even more impossible. (5th dispatch)

### British Consul to Lodge Strong Protest Against Anti-British Movement in Tianjin; Britain Does Not Intend to Directly Protect British Nationals Outside the Concession

(Tianjin) British Consul-General Jameson is preparing to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese authorities regarding the attack by Chinese mobs on the British-owned Jardine Matheson & Co. and Butterfield & Swire yesterday. It is reported that the British authorities do not intend to take unilateral measures to protect the lives and property of British nationals outside the British Concession, but will delegate the responsibility for protection to the Japanese. (5th Reuters dispatch)

(Tianjin) Yesterday, a serious anti-British movement occurred in the former Belgian Concession, Special District Four. Suddenly, 200 Chinese attacked the staff dormitories and offices of the International Export Company, the largest British trading company in Tianjin. The company's staff, including one British woman, took refuge in the Texaco oil station. When they returned to the office an hour later, they found that all the furniture had been smashed and the doors and windows had been broken. The foreign staff's dining room also suffered the same fate. It is said that the greatest loss was suffered by the Chinese staff's offices. However, the rioters did not interfere with the company's factory. Major Dilreman of the British garrison received the news one hour after the riot began and immediately notified the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters by telephone. The headquarters promised to send police to suppress the riot. The Japanese side then telephoned Dilreman, saying that some Chinese were holding a peaceful demonstration and wanted to hand over one or two items to the manager of the International Export Company, and said that any attempt to riot would be severely suppressed. It is reported that before attacking the International Export Company, the rioters went to the nearby Butterfield & Swire branch office, threatened the Chinese staff, smashed doors and windows, and slightly damaged furniture and equipment before leaving. The local authorities did not prohibit the activities of the rioters. (5th Reuters dispatch)

### American Nationals in Kaifeng Also Threatened

(Hankou) According to reliable foreign telegrams received here today, anti-British elements in Kaifeng are posing a serious threat to the lives and property of American nationals. The telegram predicts that American nationals in Kaifeng will soon be forced to withdraw. Regarding this matter, the American consulate authorities have lodged a strong protest with the Japanese authorities. (5th Reuters dispatch)

### Encouraging Youths to Apply for National Universities

The unified entrance examination for national universities this year will be held simultaneously in fifteen districts across the country starting tomorrow. Shanghai is only one of the fifteen districts, but the number of applicants has already reached several thousand. Some of these youths applying for the examination have families originally in Shanghai, and some have families in various occupied areas. All of them have come to Shanghai specifically to take the examination. A total of twenty-three universities are participating in this unified entrance examination. Only four and a half of them are in Shanghai (the Tangshan Engineering College of Jiaotong University is not in Shanghai). Eighteen and a half universities were originally in the interior or moved to the interior from Shanghai and other occupied cities. Moreover, those that remain in Shanghai are mostly independent colleges, with fewer complete universities, smaller scales, and fewer places available. The opposite is true in the interior. Therefore, in fact, these many examinees not only have a deep belief in national schools, but most of them are also preparing to study in the interior. These young people are not satisfied with their own knowledge and skills, and they aspire to further their studies. Given that transportation between Shanghai and the interior is extremely inconvenient at this time, they are not afraid of the obstacles and dangers of the journey, and they are willing to leave their hometowns and travel thousands of miles to study. Such a spirit of enthusiasm for learning is truly admirable! However, it would be too superficial, too ordinary, and too lacking in understanding of their true intentions to simply praise these enthusiastic young people from this point of view. What day is it today? What place is this? Who among the residents of Shanghai and the occupied areas does not lament the plight of their situation? Who does not wish to change their original intention of loyalty to their country and nation? And who does not wish to find a suitable opportunity to contribute their body and mind? Young people are the most sensitive and have the furthest vision. Why do they want to go to the interior? It is nothing more than that they can breathe the air of freedom and pursue a bright future in the interior. Therefore, rather than saying that their application is solely for the sake of their desire to study, it is better to say that they are determined to escape the turbid atmosphere and embrace the light. As for their parents, they would rather sacrifice the beautiful dream of having their children by their side and let their children go to the interior to seek a bright future, while also expressing their own sincerity and transporting the most needed human resources for the country and nation to the interior. The significance of this is many times greater than any material contribution such as donating money or ships. Therefore, when we see such an enthusiastic response from students in the Shanghai area, we cannot help but rejoice for the future of China. At the same time, we express our infinite respect to the aspiring youths and wise parents!

The unified entrance examination for national universities is organized by the Ministry of Education, which has the authority to weigh the number of people to be admitted, and it must have a very thorough plan in advance, which we do not need to discuss much. However, based on the needs of the Shanghai area, we feel that if the facts allow, it is best to ask the organizers to slightly increase the number of admissions in the Shanghai area. Why is there such a need? The first reason is because Shanghai has a special environment. As mentioned earlier, most of the young people applying for the examination in the Shanghai area are dissatisfied with the current environment and intend to seek light in the interior. Then the country should fully give them the opportunity to satisfy their desires. Moreover, Shanghai and its surrounding areas have always been the most important areas in the country in terms of economy, culture, and other aspects. The quality of the young people in this area is fundamentally excellent, and the enslavement education implemented by the Japanese and puppet authorities in the occupied areas, as well as the covetousness of the villains and traitors in the special area of Shanghai for culture and education, are all aimed at absorbing these outstanding young people. Although we firmly believe that the young people will never be willing to be anesthetized, and will never fail to distinguish between right and wrong, in order to preserve the vitality of the nation, maintain outstanding strength, and resist the dark forces, it is very necessary to import a large number of young people from the Shanghai area into the interior. The second reason is because the area covered by the Shanghai examination area is too large. Among the fifteen examination areas this time, Sichuan Province accounts for two, Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces each account for one, and Shanghai also accounts for one. Although Shanghai is only one of the fifteen districts on the surface, in fact, the current Shanghai has become the general hub of transportation along the coast and rivers, as well as most of the other occupied areas, that is, the general gateway from the occupied areas to the interior. Therefore, the area covered by the Shanghai examination area is actually much larger than any other area, so the number of applicants is bound to be very large. From the perspective of quantity ratio, the number of admissions should also be increased a little compared to other examination areas.

However, even if the number of admissions is indeed increased a little, the number of people who can actually be admitted will certainly be a minority. The young people who are admitted will certainly be able to develop their ambitions and add great strength to the rear areas of the war of resistance and national reconstruction; the majority of the others who are not admitted may feel infinite disappointment in their hearts. But we believe that although their experience is unfortunate, they need not be discouraged. Because since Shanghai became an isolated island, young people have certainly clamored loudly to go to the interior, but staying in Shanghai is not entirely without meaning. Of course, they don't have to adopt a passive attitude of hiding their talents and waiting for the time to come, nor do they have to live a life of indulgence that drifts with the tide, because in fact there are many important jobs that need young people to actively do. As long as young people can use their steadfast spirit and stand on their respective posts to work hard, their loyalty to the country and nation is no different from going to the interior, and the fields that can be opened up in their work can be said to be readily available. Moreover, in the current isolated island society shrouded in darkness, it is precisely pure and clean young people who are needed to be the core of society. The famous saying of Mr. Gu Tinglin, "Pine and cypress wither later in the cold season, and the rooster crows unceasingly in the wind and rain," can be transferred to young people who have the heart but not the power to go to the interior.

### United Efforts by Britain, the United States, and France to Stabilize China's Legal Tender; Morgenthau Conducting Negotiations in Britain; U.S. Government Preparing to Extend Loans to China

(London) U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is about to arrive in this city. Although this trip is of an informal nature, he will take the opportunity to discuss with representatives of the British Treasury the positions of Britain and the United States in China, especially the issue of stabilizing China's legal tender. It is reported that Britain and France recently contacted the U.S. government, proposing that Britain, France, and the United States work together to stabilize China's legal tender and requesting the United States to allocate funds to replenish the Exchange Equalization Fund. It is said that the U.S. government replied that it was willing to take parallel actions with Britain and France, but did not intend to act simultaneously. Not long after, the U.S. government announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, which shows that the U.S.'s parallel action has already been put into practice. Regarding the issue of Chinese silver deposits in the Tianjin Concession, Chamberlain has decided that it cannot be resolved by Britain and Japan alone and that the opinions of the U.S. and French governments must be sought. The negotiations in Tokyo may therefore be temporarily suspended, which is not certain. In this regard, Britain's reply to Japan will largely depend on how the general situation in Europe and the Far East develops, that is, it will depend on whether Japan joins the military alliance treaty between Germany and Italy. Regarding the issue of Japan joining the military alliance treaty between Germany and Italy, London has not yet received any credible information. If this is true, then Britain will immediately believe that it must deal with Japan with a more forceful attitude. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will also formulate methods to assist China with Sir Leith-Ross, the economic advisor to the British government, which can be said with certainty. (5th Havas dispatch)

(Washington) The financial and economic situation of China was recently commented on by people close to the State Department, who said that it is extremely delicate in nature. Japan is planning to revive the occupied areas of China economically as a long-term plan and is forcibly using new currency as the sole medium of exchange in those areas. Foreign merchants refuse to recognize this currency and therefore cannot engage in commerce in the occupied areas. Therefore, American interests are directly threatened. The government has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government, and at the same time, it will continue to purchase Chinese silver and extend credit to China. After Congress adjourns, the government will once again launch an initiative to demonstrate to Japan the U.S.'s determination to protect its interests in the Far East. (4th Havas dispatch)

### Chinese Government Statement to Britain Regarding Ownership of Silver in Tianjin; Guo Taiqi Visits British Foreign Office; French Attitude Consistent with Britain

(London) Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi met with Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Meng Sui this afternoon. It is reported that the Chinese government is concerned about the issue of Chinese silver deposits in the British and French concessions in Tianjin. During a meeting of the House of Commons today, a Member of Parliament asked whether the government had requested the Japanese side to stop the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, since the British-Japanese plan had already been established. Foreign Secretary Butler replied that Sir Craigie, the ambassador to Japan, is currently continuing to urge the Japanese side to lift all restrictions. According to informed sources in Paris, the British government previously consulted the French side on the issue of Chinese silver in the British and French concessions in Tianjin. The French government has now replied, saying that the interests of Britain and France are linked and that France will take the same attitude as Britain on this matter. It is generally believed that the French government has notified the Japanese side of its attitude. (4th Reuters dispatch)

(London) The Chinese government notified the British government yesterday, stating that as the owner of the silver stored in the British concession in Tianjin, it requests that Britain consult with the Chongqing government before deciding on the conditions proposed by Japan for the custody of the silver. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi solemnly stated when he visited British Foreign Secretary Mousse yesterday that Britain has the necessity to discuss the Tianjin silver issue with China and other relevant powers. Britain has exchanged views with the United States and France on the issue of disposing of the silver, but has not yet discussed the issue of the ownership of the silver. (5th Associated Press dispatch)

### China and Britain to Discuss China's Currency System in Hong Kong

(Hong Kong) Informed sources here believe that the rumors circulating among the Chinese that a Sino-British conference will be held in Hong Kong soon to discuss China's currency system and the Exchange Equalization Fund are not yet ripe. There are no arrangements for such a conference to be held in the next half month. According to Chinese sources, Song Ziwen and Bei Zuyi will attend this conference on the Chinese side, and Rogers, a member of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, will attend on the British side. (5th Reuters dispatch)

### Imprisoned Indian in Hankou Regains Freedom

(Hankou) Mr. Singh, an Indian who was kidnapped from the Asia Oil Company gas station by several Chinese two weeks ago, has now regained his freedom. According to Mr. Singh, who spoke to visiting reporters, after he was kidnapped, he was held in various houses near the Shantou station, and he was moved every time. His eyes were wrapped in cloth so that he could not see anything. Sometimes, people wearing Chinese clothes interrogated him and ordered him to write a confession and sign his name on it, admitting that the British and Chinese staff of the Asia Oil Company had represented the Chinese in purchasing military supplies. He immediately refused. At about 10:00 p.m. on August 2, someone suddenly put a cloth bag over his head, tied his hands together, and took him to the wilderness in a car, saying that if he did not confess, he would be executed. While they were arguing, another car drove up. When everyone saw this, they all fled. The person who came shouted his name, claiming that he had come to rescue him, and took him to the Japanese Gendarmerie headquarters, where he was treated very well and taken to the Asia Oil Company gas station in a car. (5th Reuters dispatch)

### Craigie's Request for Instructions Not Yet Replied To; Negotiations in Tokyo Temporarily Suspended; British Foreign Secretary's Statement Provokes Japanese Resentment

(Tokyo) According to the Japan Times, the main principles for maintaining peace and order in Tianjin have been negotiated between representatives of the British and Japanese governments in Tokyo. The British representative is Herbert, the consul in Tianjin, and the Japanese representative is Tanaka, the consul in Tianjin. The newspaper also said that the current agreement being negotiated is preparing to draft a written agreement to be exchanged between the two governments. Regarding economic issues, the British ambassador has not yet received any instructions from the British government. (5th Associated Press dispatch)

(Tokyo) It is reported that British Ambassador Craigie visited Kato, the chief Japanese representative at the round table conference last night, and explained to him that the instructions from London had not yet arrived. This instruction is related to the report of the economic and police subcommittees sent to London on August 1. Kato then invited Muto and Miyamoto, representatives of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:10 p.m. to report on Craigie's visit and discussed future procedures related to the conference. According to observers, Craigie will be able to receive British instructions on economic and police issues in Tianjin around August 7, at which time the conference will be held again. (5th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) Representatives of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, who are participating in the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo, openly stated that they have had unpleasant feelings about the remarks made by British Foreign Secretary Halifax in the Upper House, believing that the agreement reached by Craigie and Tanaka has been destroyed, and said that the British government's delay in issuing instructions to Craigie is aimed at delaying the matter. If such methods are not changed, the Japanese army in North China will have to take action to protect its security. (5th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to the Japanese Times today, Herbert, the British Consul in Tianjin, and Tanaka, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, held an informal meeting from 4:30 p.m. to 6:10 p.m. on Friday, and the preparatory steps for the agreement between the two countries have been completed. This agreement contains the following points: (1) The Tianjin British Concession Police Department will hand over the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng to the Japanese side; (2) The Japanese side will cooperate with the Tianjin Municipal Council to arrest anti-Japanese elements, communists, and general criminals in the British Concession; (3) In order to achieve this goal, a liaison department must be established; (4) Strict control of anti-Japanese publications, education, and other similar activities in the British Concession; (5) Dismissal of anti-Japanese police officers in the British Concession; (6) The Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council Police Department must appoint Japanese police officers; (7) The Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council will appoint Japanese advisors. However, although the two sides have generally agreed on this police agreement, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie has not received instructions from his government on economic issues, so the negotiations have reached a deadlock. According to the Japan Times, if the British side deliberately delays the conference, the Japanese government will require the British side to give a reply with a limited date.

### Yesterday Morning, Japanese Planes Again Attacked Chongqing, Bombed the Western Part of the City for One and a Half Hours, Significant Damage Occurred in the Jialing River South Bank Area, Even the Belgian Embassy Building Was Hit by Shrapnel

(Chongqing) This morning, Chongqing was again bombed by Japanese planes. This bombing was the fourth in five days. Foreign consulates suffered severe damage again. A missionary's residence was destroyed. Around 1:00 AM this morning, 18 Japanese planes invaded Chongqing, bombing the western district of Chongqing and the area along the Yangtze River north of the city for one and a half hours. The Japanese planes flew over Chongqing in small formations. After Chinese anti-aircraft teams used searchlights to locate the enemy planes, they fired anti-aircraft guns at them. A 500-pound bomb exploded at the Belgian Embassy. Six Americans and five other foreigners who had taken refuge in the Belgian Embassy's air-raid shelter were greatly shocked. The windows of the Belgian Embassy were shattered, and the plaster on the walls fell. The plaster on the walls of the residence of the American Methodist missionary, Mr. Lei Pu, half a mile from the embassy, was also knocked down. The bomb also damaged more than twenty large residences near the embassy, destroyed four cars, and caused a wall to collapse into the ground, behind which many Chinese civilians were taking refuge. After hearing the sound of the wall collapsing and the cries of civilians, Mr. Liang, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Belgian Embassy, and Mr. Li Naer of the Sino-Belgian Bank immediately led a Chinese rescue team to provide assistance. The two Belgians, wearing white linen clothes and using wooden staffs, helped the rescue team to pull the injured out from under the collapsed wall. (Reuter, 5th)

(Chongqing) During the Japanese bombing here this morning, a bomb landed near the Belgian Embassy, causing considerable panic among the American journalists who had taken refuge in the Belgian Embassy's air-raid shelter. Although none were seriously injured, all suffered minor abrasions. Initially, everyone thought the entrance of the air-raid shelter had been sealed, but later they realized it had not, which greatly relieved them. Among the American journalists taking refuge in the Belgian Embassy's air-raid shelter were Mr. Bao Ting, a reporter from the New York Times, and his wife, the American writer, Mr. Snow, Mr. Huai De, a researcher at Harvard-Yenching, and Ms. Peng Fei'er, a former Reuter reporter now working as a correspondent for a British newspaper. In addition, there were two French journalists. The foreign journalists and writers tried to carry the injured Chinese into the embassy building and gave wine to those who were unconscious from the crush to revive them. At the same time, Zhu Jiahua, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee, Huang Renlin, Director-General of the New Life Movement, and Mr. Shitingni, the German head of Chiang Kai-shek's bodyguard, also assisted in the emergency rescue work. The Japanese planes were able to take advantage of the bright moonlight during this attack. Also, the duration of the recent Japanese bombings has been longer than in the past. Therefore, many people believe that these Japanese planes are not taking off from Hankou, but from somewhere northwest of Hankou. In the past, Japanese planes would quickly drop their bombs and immediately return to their base. However, in the past three weeks, Japanese planes have often been able to conduct fifteen to twenty minutes of reconnaissance before carrying out their bombings. It seems that they no longer need to worry about having enough gasoline. (Reuter, 5th)

(Chongqing) On the night of the 4th, under a bright moon, Japanese planes attacked again in two batches. The Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft units coordinated their fire and successfully repelled the attacking Japanese planes. Prior to the attack, the Air Defense Command received reports that approximately 18 Japanese planes, divided into two batches, were flying from western Hubei to attack Chongqing. The Chinese Air Force immediately took off to intercept them, and the anti-aircraft units and searchlights also coordinated their operations. Soon, the first batch of nine Japanese planes sneaked into the city's airspace from the southwest. The Chinese anti-aircraft units immediately launched a head-on attack. The Japanese planes hastily dropped their bombs and tried to escape to the northeast when they encountered the Chinese Air Force. A fierce battle broke out in the suburbs. The Chinese Air Force repeatedly attacked, and the Japanese planes, suffering damage, dared not linger and fled eastward. The second batch of ten Japanese planes flew to the eastern suburbs of Chongqing. After dropping bombs, they continued to fly into the city's airspace and circled several times. Because the Chinese air defense forces were closely monitoring them, the Japanese planes were unable to succeed and fled back to the eastern suburbs, where they dropped a few more bombs before escaping. According to a post-attack investigation, although the Japanese planes dropped many explosive bombs and incendiary bombs in the suburbs, most of them landed in the fields, so the Chinese side suffered only minor losses. Details are under investigation. (Telegram, 5th)

(Chongqing) This morning, before dawn, Japanese planes came to wreak havoc again. This is the fourth bombing that Chongqing has encountered this week. Chinese fighter planes took off upon hearing the alarm and initially intercepted them. However, several Japanese planes flew to the near suburbs of the city and the new commercial center, dropping bombs. Several heavy bombs fell near the Datong News Agency office. The front door, which had been locked, was blasted open, and the building also suffered slight damage. The extent of the damage throughout the city has not yet been fully reported. (Datong News Agency Telegram, 5th)

(Chongqing) On the morning of the 4th, during the Japanese attack on Chongqing, a heavy bomb fell in the consulate area. The British Consulate suffered slight damage, and the French Consulate building suffered more significant damage. Five people were killed nearby. Also, a bomb fell behind the German Consulate, destroying a portion of the consulate's building and causing significant material damage. Three neighboring houses were also affected and destroyed, killing three people and injuring two. The residence of Mr. Nord, an employee of the German Embassy, was also destroyed. In addition, the residence of Mr. Dou Dian'an, the special correspondent of the New York Times, was destroyed by a bomb that fell a few feet away. Mr. Dou's family and the famous writer, Mr. Xushi Te, who was visiting Dou's residence, took refuge in the air-raid shelter and were all unharmed. (Telegram, 4th)

(Chongqing) On the 4th, during the Japanese attack on Chongqing, the houses and property of the British, French, and German consulates were destroyed. On the 5th, during the air raid, Japanese planes dropped bombs near the Belgian Embassy, causing part of the embassy to be destroyed by shrapnel. The Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Di Sang, guided reporters to inspect the bombed or damaged offices, dining rooms, reception rooms, and dormitories. Plaster had fallen from the walls, doors and windows were tilted, and rubble and broken glass were scattered everywhere. Embassy staff were spared because they had taken refuge in the air-raid shelter in advance. After the Japanese planes wreaked havoc nearby and before the all-clear signal was given, Chargé d'Affaires Di Sang and his friend, Mr. Cu Na, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Belgian Bank, left the shelter to assist in rescue work. They often rescued three or four Chinese civilians and bandaged their wounds. Their spirit of chivalry is worthy of admiration. (Telegram, 5th)

(Chongqing) Chongqing was again subjected to an air raid this morning, which is the fourth time this week. The casualties are feared to be numerous. A total of eighteen Japanese planes, divided into two teams, concentrated their bombing on the northwestern suburbs, along the mountains facing the south bank of the Jialing River. All the houses were destroyed. The Belgian Embassy narrowly escaped being hit, with the bombs falling only a few inches away. The main gate of the embassy was shattered, all the glass windows were broken, and the plaster on the walls and ceilings fell in large quantities. The power poles leading to the embassy were bombed to the ground, making it very dangerous for pedestrians. Three cars outside the main gate were completely wrecked. Fortunately, no one was injured. At 1:30 AM, the first team of Japanese planes flew from the southeast, passed over Chongqing, and went to the northwest. Chinese anti-aircraft guns responded with heavy fire. The Japanese planes bombed in both the southeastern and northwestern suburbs, but more bombs were dropped in the northwestern suburbs. When the Japanese planes flew away, Chinese fighter planes took off from north of Chongqing and engaged the Japanese planes in a brief air battle. Over half an hour later, the second team of Japanese planes appeared and dropped bombs on the airport downstream of Chongqing before flying straight towards Chongqing. When they reached the western suburbs, they turned back to the east and bombed the airport for the second time as they flew downstream. It was initially reported that a third team of Japanese planes was flying towards Chongqing, but they did not appear. The all-clear signal was given at 3:00 AM. (Reuter, 5th)

### The Zhang and Wei Rivers Have Successively Burst Their Banks

(Luoyang) Due to continuous heavy rains in Anyang, Linzhang, Neihuang and other counties, the Zhang and Wei Rivers have successively burst their banks, creating a disaster area of hundreds of miles, with water depths exceeding ten feet on flat ground. (Telegram, 5th)

### Negotiations for the Tripartite Pact Between Japan, Germany, and Italy Will Be Held in Germany, Rumored to Be Announced in September, Spain, Hungary, and Bulgaria Are Being Wooed, Japan's Intention Is to Boost Morale

(Berlin) Regarding the rumor that Japan will join the alliance treaty of Germany and Italy, responsible parties here, upon hearing of it, refused to comment, only stating that negotiations on this matter are in progress and that revealing the results in advance would be contrary to German custom. The fact that these negotiations are not yet complete can be seen from this. Authoritative observers say that General Terauchi, the former Minister of the Army of Japan, and Admiral Osumi, the former Minister of the Navy, will lead a delegation to visit and are scheduled to arrive in Germany at the end of this month. The current negotiations should make substantial progress at that time so that the tripartite pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy can be announced in September, and solemnly announced at the National Socialist Party Congress. It is said that General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, is the strongest advocate for changing the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance treaty. Mr. Shiratori Toshio, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, has also expressed his support. It is rumored that when Ambassador Shiratori recently came to Berlin, Ambassador Oshima attempted to force Foreign Minister Arita to step down so that Shiratori could succeed him. Ambassador Oshima has recently met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop many times to discuss the strengthening of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Some individuals in German political circles believe that Germany should strengthen its ties with Spain to counter any alliance that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union might form, but the government authorities are eager to establish an alliance treaty with Japan. (Havas, 4th)

(Rome) Diplomatic circles here learned today that preparations for Japan's entry into the Italian-German military alliance are in their final stages. Italy and Germany are also attempting to woo Spain, Hungary, and Bulgaria into the Italian-German military alliance structure. The totalitarian nations are apparently seeking to counteract the international impact caused by the termination of the Japanese-American trade treaty and the British-French-Soviet military talks. According to Japanese ambassadors to Germany and Italy, they have discussed Japan's entry into the Italian-German military alliance in Rome and Berlin and have chosen Cernobbio as the location for their final meeting, "because that is where German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met before, and it is considered an auspicious place." Mr. Shiratori Toshio, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, and General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, stated that they would be staying in Cernobbio until Monday. (AP, 5th)

Talks Between Two Japanese Ambassadors Have Concluded

Milan - The talks between General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, and Mr. Shiratori Toshio, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, along with Japanese military attaches, held on the shores of Lake Como, have ended. Yesterday, the representatives had lengthy telephone calls with Tokyo and Berlin. The counselors of the German and Italian embassies traveled to Rome by plane, while the Japanese military attaches stationed in Italy went to northern Italy to observe Italian military exercises. (Datong Telegram, 5th)

(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers have not disclosed the contents of the Lake Como talks, only stating that the main purpose of the talks was for Japan to discuss policies for dealing with the European political situation. (Datong Telegram, 5th)

Milan - Mr. Shiratori Toshio, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, and their entourage continued to meet at the Stresa village on the shores of Lake Como yesterday. The content of the discussions was kept strictly secret, but it is said that a detailed report has been sent to Tokyo. It is rumored that the two ambassadors plan to stay on the lake shore for a few more days or return to their posts on the 6th. (Datong Telegram, 5th)

Italian Newspapers Show No Enthusiastic Reaction

(London) Regarding the news that Mr. Shiratori Toshio, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, and General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, jointly telegraphed the Tokyo government to join the military alliance between Germany and Italy, The Times of London recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Rome stating that Italian newspapers showed no enthusiastic reaction. This is most surprising. For all events that are truly welcomed by the Fascist government, Italian newspapers invariably exaggerate and embellish them. The fact that this matter is not mentioned at all is beyond the expectations of the general public. It should be noted that the proposal for Japan to join the military alliance between Germany and Italy was put forward by Germany and Italy several months ago. If Japan now requests to join, Germany and Italy would not be in a position to refuse. However, the situation has changed greatly since then. At the beginning of this year, Japan was not very involved in European disputes. Germany and Italy deeply hoped that Japan would have conflicts with Britain and France, so that a part of the navies of those countries would be restrained by the Far East situation. Today, even though Japan has not signed a military alliance treaty with the Berlin-Rome axis, it has already made enemies on its own. Germany and Italy have achieved their wish to restrain Britain and France in the Far East and can easily take advantage of it. If war breaks out between Britain and Japan, it will be easier for Germany and Italy to deal with the situation in Europe, and the diplomacy of those countries will be more powerful as a result. Why is it necessary to seek assistance from Japan? Conversely, if those countries become Japan's allies, they may have to fight Britain at an unfavorable time, which is not a wise plan. Based on this, even if the military alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan is realized, it will certainly have many loopholes, and it must provide considerable guarantees to Germany and Italy so that they are not bound by Far Eastern affairs. (Havas, 5th)

(Rome) A semi-official communique was issued, the content of which differs somewhat from the statements made yesterday by Mr. Shiratori, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, and General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany. The communique stated that the ambassadors discussed the issue of "Japan joining the military alliance between Germany and Italy." However, when newspapers reprinted the above-mentioned statements, they used the phrase "Japan is strengthening cooperation with the Axis powers." This difference is noteworthy. Currently, the ambassadors are still residing on the shores of Lake Como awaiting instructions from the government. Military attaches from the Japanese embassies in Germany and Italy have gone to the Po River valley in northern Italy to observe army exercises. (Havas, 4th)

Japan's Action Is Mostly Exploratory in Nature

(London) General Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, and Mr. Shiratori, the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, held a meeting in the town of Villa d'Este on the shores of Lake Como in Italy yesterday and issued statements. The implication is that Japan has a great possibility of joining the military alliance between Italy and Germany. Political figures here have commented on this matter, generally believing that the statements are exploratory in nature. Their intention is to demonstrate to democratic countries, due to the imminent conclusion of the talks in Moscow and the hardening of the United States' attitude towards Japan. The actions that Japan may take, Italy and Germany may not be willing to support in order to avoid being bound by constraints, and Japan may not be willing to establish overly rigid ties with those countries. From this perspective, it is difficult for Japan and the German-Italian axis to truly cooperate. The Times recently published an editorial commenting on the matter, also stating that the statements of the two ambassadors, Shiratori and Oshima, are exploratory in nature. It said, "The talks in Moscow have made progress, and the United States' attitude towards Japan is hardening. Japan is trying to put pressure on Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, issuing an indication that if the democratic countries do not maintain normal relations with Japan, the country may conclude an alliance treaty with Germany and Italy at any time. However, this kind of strategy may not achieve its purpose, and the Japanese government, apart from having diplomats and soldiers make statements, may not take further action to increase the obligations it bears." The "Strong News" reported, "The closer Japan cooperates with Germany and Italy, the more solid the relationship between the United States, the Soviet Union, and the democratic countries of Western Europe will become." In addition, other people from all walks of life have also discussed this, saying that if Japan joins the German-Italian alliance, its sound will only endanger itself. For example, Mr. Lei Wei, the Secretary-General of the Pacific Affairs Research Society, also believes that Japan may not take this action and said that the United States' announcement to terminate the U.S.-Japan trade treaty already contains a warning. If Japan joins the German-Italian alliance, the United States will definitely continue to take action. It is said that most of the petroleum needed by Japan comes from the United States, and if the United States stops supplying it, Japan's war against China cannot be sustained for more than six months. A representative of the European branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party stated that Japan joining the German-Italian alliance is a condition put forward by the German-Italian axis to aid Japan, so this matter is unavoidable. "However, what our Nationalist Party members can be encouraged by is that democratic countries will be able to cooperate more easily, and the United States will sooner or later join the peace front, which is what we welcome." General Malé, the former commander of the French troops in China, also expressed his opinion on the proposal for Japan to join the German-Italian alliance. He said that Japan may not be able to make a substantial threat to all the territories of the democratic countries in the Far East. There are four reasons for this: (1) Japan is already feeling difficulty in the war against China and cannot take care of other things; (2) If Japan attacks the territories of democratic countries, it is likely to have conflicts with the Soviet Union at any time; (3) Britain and France have cooperated in the Far East, and practical plans have been drawn up as a result of the Wellington Conference (representatives from the British and Australian Commonwealths and the New Zealand Dominion have met in Wellington to discuss Pacific defense) and the Singapore Conference; (4) If the situation in the Far East worsens, the United States' attitude will inevitably become more forceful, which is the biggest crisis for Japan. (Havas, 4th)

It Will Be Difficult for the United States to Sign a New Trade Treaty with Japan

(Washington) U.S. government officials are very concerned about the statements made yesterday by the two Japanese ambassadors in Italy. The government authorities have not officially expressed their opinions, only stating that if Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance, it will treat third countries more like warring states. If so, it will be difficult for the U.S. government to conclude a new trade treaty, and U.S. public opinion will certainly support the government's ban on the export of military supplies to Japan. Senator Kim, a Democrat from Utah, said that Japan's move can indicate that it has previously flaunted with the German-Italian axis, and the gap between the U.S. and Japan will inevitably deepen. The United States will take more effective defense measures, and Congress may pass another 2,000,000,000 U.S. dollars in military spending. Kim also said that Japan's move will speed up the conclusion of a British-French-Soviet military alliance. Senior government officials indicated that the Japanese joining the German-Italian military alliance will raise several new issues: (1) The Soviet Union will be surrounded; (2) The strength of several British colonies will be weakened. However, the British-French-Soviet military talks to be held in Moscow in the middle of next week may take these points into consideration and take precautions. Most observers believe that this move by Japan will have the greatest impact on the psychology of the Japanese people and can resist the anti-aggression movement of the democratic bloc. American diplomatic circles believe that this move by Japan is not very important at the present time when the conflict in Europe is slightly calmer. They stated that if a European war breaks out, the United States may not be able to avoid participating, so the United States' foreign policy towards Japan should undoubtedly be paid attention to. People in the government all believe that this move by the Japanese will not have a great impact on American public opinion, because the American people have long recognized these totalitarian countries as a military unit, but public opinion will certainly support the ban on the export of military supplies to Japan. (AP, 5th)

Not Much Impact on the Sino-Japanese War

(Chongqing) The news from Rome that the Japanese ambassadors to Italy and Germany are discussing the conclusion of a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy has not shocked officials here. Most officials today believe that the news was deliberately spread for the purpose of enhancing Japan's position in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. Officials here have long anticipated that Japan is preparing to build on the foundation of a military alliance with Germany and Italy, the main purpose of which is for Japanese military figures to respond to the increasing conflicts between Tokyo, Washington, and London. Since Britain and Japan held talks in Tokyo, officials believe that Japan will strengthen its position in the negotiations by concluding a tripartite military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. The Japanese side will threaten Britain that unless Britain succumbs to Japan's conditions, Japan will sign a military alliance. Chinese officials claim that if Japan joins the German-Italian axis, it will provide the totalitarian countries with much-needed naval power. Chinese officials continued to say that they are unable to draw a fixed conclusion until Japan issues a statement about Japan joining the Rome-Berlin military alliance. They believe that Japan is spreading the news of its plan to sign a military alliance for the purpose of strengthening Japan's future position and engaging in immediate negotiations with Britain, while attempting to split the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, because a British-Soviet military alliance would leave the Soviet Union with enemies on two borders. The Tokyo negotiations have not ended, and the Soviet-British military alliance has not yet been signed. Most Chinese believe that the news that the Japanese side has signed a military alliance is to test Britain's willingness to sign a peace agreement and reconcile with Japan. China is not worried about how the military alliance will affect the Sino-Japanese War. If a European war does not break out this year, then the military alliance can only help Japan with military supplies and other assistance. The Chinese believe that even if Japan does not sign an alliance, Japan will be able to obtain a steady stream of supplies from Germany and Italy. The recent U.S. termination of the U.S.-Japan trade treaty and the U.S. plan to implement a ban on the export of military supplies to Japan will weaken Japan's position more than the military alliance can offset. This is because both Germany and Italy feel a lack of oil, cotton, and other raw materials, and these military raw materials are necessary for Japan, and the totalitarian countries are short of capital and cannot provide loans to Japan. From the Chinese perspective, the military alliance will weaken Japan's position in the Far East, because a European war will deplete Japan's naval power and hinder the flow of large quantities of military supplies and other assistance into the Japanese-occupied areas of China to supply the Japanese army fighting in China. It is believed here that Japan is determined to expand its strength in the Far East and will not participate in Western wars. Although a military alliance can give the Japanese an excuse to take over Hong Kong and British concessions in China, the Chinese believe that even if there is no military alliance, Japan plans to occupy these areas when a European war breaks out, so a military alliance will not help Japan at all. As for Italy and Germany mediating the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese claim that such action is practically impossible because they do not believe that Japan will propose conditions that Chiang Kai-shek deems acceptable during negotiations. (AP, 5th)

(Chongqing) The news that Japan may join the Italian-German military alliance has once again sparked debate here as to whether this is beneficial or harmful to China's resistance against Japan. Most people believe that Japan's joining the alliance may be a disturbing factor in the initial stages, but it will ultimately be beneficial to China. This is because the move will effectively clarify the international situation and force Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries to abandon hopes of seeking a compromise with Japan. At the same time, for military reasons, the above-mentioned countries will necessarily assist China in its resistance against Japan. (Reuter, 5th)

### Japan Uncovers Assassination Plot; Pessimism Toward China War; People in Panic

Tokyo, 5th - Associated Press correspondent Thompson reports that unease is gradually appearing among the Japanese public. On one hand, they are weary of the war, and on the other, they feel anxious about the future. Since the start of the war between China and Japan, it has been more than two years. Although the Japanese people have not diminished their patriotism during this war, they are already deeply dissatisfied with the lack of success in the fighting. This unease can be seen in the precautionary measures taken by the police authorities. Many men wearing white kimonos go to shrines in various places to pray every evening. Their actions are quite mysterious, so the police authorities have paid close attention to them. In addition, a major plot to assassinate important government figures has been uncovered due to a leak. In the past, various rebellions and riots have been preceded by religious fanaticism and mysterious rituals. Before Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated in 1932, members of the Blood Pledge Corps also acted in the same way. Furthermore, on July 15th of this year, the Tokyo police arrested three people who were plotting murder. According to their confessions, they confirmed a plot to assassinate former Minister Makino Nobuaki and the current Minister Yuasa Kurahira and Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira Tsuneo. Since then, unconfirmed news has spread in Japan that other murderers are plotting to assassinate Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa, Navy Vice Minister Yamamoto Isoroku, and former Minister (current Chairman of the Price Policy Committee) Ikeda Shigeaki. All of the above-mentioned figures are moderates whose abilities are top-notch. They oppose conflicts with other countries and use their influence to prevent the signing of a military alliance treaty between Germany, Italy, and Japan. As for Britain and the United States, they advocate a moderate attitude. It is said that Ikeda, Yuasa, and others are all figures disliked by ultra-nationalists. These ultra-nationalists are not familiar with the economic situation, and their knowledge of international affairs is very limited. They firmly believe that Japan can achieve a prominent position in the world through forceful methods. The anti-British movement in Tokyo this summer has already shown another phenomenon in the current situation.

### Details of Foreign Affairs Debate Before British Parliament Recesses; Members Urge Government to Take Strong Stance Against Japan; Chamberlain Still Advocates Maintaining Tolerance

(London) - Labor MP Noel-Baker initiated a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons today, advocating that Britain abolish the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty. The Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, was also in the diplomatic gallery. Noel-Baker stated that since the drafting of the rules of war three hundred years ago, no war has been more barbaric and illegal than what Japan has done in China. History will not forget its shameless and cruel massacres. The U.S. State Department estimates that the Japanese have committed no fewer than six hundred acts of violence against American citizens, and the violence against British citizens must amount to thousands. The ultimate goal of the Japanese is to expel Westerners from Asia. The losses on the Chinese military side have decreased and are now equal to those of the Japanese. The only hope of the Japanese is to destroy guerrilla tactics, and the only effective way to achieve this is to undermine the trust of Chinese farmers in the Chinese legal tender. Chamberlain replied that the British government strongly opposes many unfortunate incidents involving the Japanese in recent months. I do not want to hide the fact that I want the House of Commons to be concerned about this situation because it presents special difficulties for Britain. There is a fundamental difference between Britain and the United States, which is separated from Europe. This hardly needs to be said. We must constantly remember that even as the Japanese inflict insults and injuries on British people in China, there is a limit to what we can do to help British people in China at this time. At this moment, we do not have a fleet in the Far East that is superior to Japan's. We have a superior navy in Europe, and in certain circumstances, it may be necessary to send this fleet. I hope that you will not always assume that such a situation is absolutely out of the question. I say this not as a threat, but as a warning. At the same time, we would rather resolve disputes with Japan through discussion and negotiation, without sacrificing what we consider to be fundamental concerns and principles, than to do so through threats of force. I often think of the isolated, helpless, and undefended British people scattered throughout China. Even if we clearly decide to take the ultimate and extreme action, we cannot protect many British expatriates. We have a responsibility to them and should not put them in greater danger than they are currently in if we can avoid it. The Prime Minister, in his speech, praised the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, for handling extremely difficult negotiations with great ability, composure, and courage. The Prime Minister continued to discuss the proposed solutions, saying that it does not matter how the words of the solutions are interpreted, but how their meaning is interpreted in practice. If the British government declares that this solution does not contain any change in policy, and in fact British policy has not changed, then this declaration is more important than anything else. In any case, this solution has allowed us to discuss the very sensitive situation in Tianjin. Speaking of some of the difficulties, it seems that we should not have great difficulty in reaching an agreement with the Japanese. I can say that because the agreement must be viewed as a whole, it is useless to agree on one point if agreement cannot be reached on other points. Those currently handling the negotiations are not as inclined to extremes or unreasonable as many of the Japanese we see in China. As for the current Japanese request for joint policing in Tianjin, I do not know what this so-called "Japanese" refers to, because opinions in Tianjin and Japan often differ. But in cases of doubt, I believe we should accept the opinions of Tokyo. The basis for discussion in Tokyo is not for Anglo-Japanese joint policing, but for the police power to remain in the hands of the Municipal Council or its officials. Regarding the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng, I do not consider Noel-Baker's demand that the government guarantee that they will not be extradited under any circumstances to be different, but I cannot call Noel-Baker a person with a judicial sense. Noel-Baker interjected upon hearing this, saying that this is not a matter of judicial sense, but a matter of national honor. Chamberlain replied that he absolutely did not think so. This is a matter of evidence. If there is evidence to prove that these four people are indeed related to the assassination of Cheng, would Noel-Baker say that not extraditing them is a matter of honor? Our position has always been that we cannot extradite them without evidence. Today, Japan has presented evidence, and we are currently studying it. I do not intend to announce what the verdict will be after legal authorities have studied it. If the result of the study is that there is clear evidence of criminal activity, then we have no right to take any action other than extradition. Chamberlain continued to respond to Noel-Baker's remarks, saying that the court is a Chinese court that has existed for a long time, and it is the court to which criminals have been handed over in the past twenty months. Chamberlain continued to mention the silver deposit issue, saying that this discussion must be a local issue. This has been agreed upon. The difficulty now lies in the fact that this silver is in Tianjin, and the problems arising from the currency system involve the circulation of Tianjin legal tender. In the opinion of the British government, we cannot handle the Tianjin problem without truly involving problems elsewhere. Whatever measures we take regarding silver deposits or currency will inevitably affect a much wider area than Tianjin. Not only the British government is related to these two points. We have explained to the Japanese government that we are not prepared to solve the two problems of silver deposits and currency with Japan alone. These two problems can only be solved after consultation with other governments that have the same relationship. I do not intend to specify whether to consult or not. Which will be our attitude? I want to say that I do not object to Noel-Baker's remarks regarding the relationship between maintaining Chinese currency and China's ability to continue guerrilla warfare. As for the suggestion to abolish the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty, we have never gone back on anything. There is nothing in our obligations in Geneva and Beijing that would cause us to abolish the commercial treaty with Japan. If I do not give Noel-Baker the assurance that we will abolish this treaty, it seems that I have decided not to abandon this treaty, but I will not allow anyone to interpret my words. Chamberlain continued, saying that the abolition of the treaty will only take effect after twelve months, and the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty is attached to the commercial treaties of several autonomous territories. Therefore, the British abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan will have a significant impact on the autonomous territories. It would be autocratic if the British government did not take these facts into account. We are forced to bear some very significant responsibilities and constraints in Europe, the effect of which is that if some event occurs in Europe, Britain must go to war. Therefore, Britain cannot make the same constraints in the Far East. Britain is a country with immeasurable financial resources, and its people have a resolute spirit. However, there is a limit to what we should take on. All events in the Far East are truly inspiring. I sympathize with them. I am also moved by events in the Far East. But no matter how we feel, let us not forget the responsibilities we have already shouldered, or the situation of our men and women in that area. Chamberlain concluded by saying that we will strive to continue negotiations, maintain the principles on which our actions are based, and the welfare of the British in that area. We will strive to show patience and reasonable moderation, acknowledging that behind this violence there may be genuine concerns among the Japanese in China about how we treat them. However, we must not forget that in the coming months, there may be even more serious and pressing issues to consider. We must maintain our strength to cope with any event that may occur. (Reuters, 4th)

(London) - During the discussion of the Far East situation in the House of Commons last night before the summer recess, Labor MP Noel-Baker said that on the one hand, we are spending millions of pounds to resist aggression in Europe, and on the other hand, we are buying goods exported from Japan to finance its aggression in the Far East. This situation is quite amazing. Japan is now using all its force to try to force Britain to be its true accomplice in its aggression in China. Labor members have expressed concern about the Tokyo negotiations from the beginning. The Japanese are actually trying to extort and use the Tokyo solutions as a starting point for making greater and unacceptable demands. Noel-Baker also expressed serious concern about the joint policing control in Tianjin, saying that Japan has used this point elsewhere to arrest Chinese who harm and are loyal to the Chinese government. Japan's actions are damaging our prestige, which is very important in the East. If this continues for a long time, it will damage the entire policy of the British government to avoid war. We should declare China as part of the peace front. Conservative MP Admiral Sir Roger Keyes then declared that he had spent a long time with the Japanese and knew that if we were hesitant and self-deprecating, it would only lead them to further aggression. If strong action had been taken in the past, it would never have led to today's danger. British naval personnel all know that the government's desire to avoid accidents in the Far East has placed its naval and army commanders in a position of humiliation, and has made it extremely difficult for them to deal with arrogant and ambitious Japanese military leaders. Losing face in the East is an extremely serious matter, but if we take the right path now, our prestige can be quickly restored. We need great action in the East to show the Japanese that we Europeans will not tolerate such behavior. Conservative MP Mr. McNamara finally spoke, hoping that the government would review the issue of foreign concessions in China after the situation stabilizes. From a military point of view, these concessions are equivalent to isolated sentry posts, which are tiresome. (Reuters, 5th)

(London) - At a meeting of the House of Commons this morning to discuss the Far East issue, several important members, such as Liberal MP Mendell and Conservative MP Colonel McNamara, all advocated that all countries with relations in the Far East, such as the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, the Dutch East Indies, French Vietnam, Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, should form a united front to confront Japan. Colonel McNamara also said, "Only one of the English-language newspapers in Japan belongs to British merchants, and the rest are run by Americans or Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese cannot understand British views. This layer must be remedied." (Havas, 4th)

### British and French Newspapers Comment on the Far East Situation; British Prime Minister Warns Japan; Patience Has Limits

(London) - The Daily Mail published an editorial today, mentioning Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday regarding the dispatch of the British fleet to the Far East, saying that this was indeed serious language, but it was very much in line with the spirit of our country. Every British citizen shares the emotions expressed by the Prime Minister when he announced that several recent events in China had caused his blood to boil. Our patience has limits, and this warning to the Japanese has not crossed that limit. We are now too busy with many things in Europe. In the current situation, it is better for us to maintain peace in the West than to provoke war in the East. The Daily Telegraph said that the Prime Minister has issued a serious warning to Japan, which should make the East understand that our patience is not endless. Our major responsibilities elsewhere force us to be cautious in dealing with the overall situation in the Far East, but it would be a great mistake to think that the people of Britain will not be filled with anger at everything that is happening in the Far East. The Times said that there is no doubt that Japanese diplomacy has been under great pressure from the Japanese army on the Asian continent in the past two months. However, it is unlikely that Japanese military leaders will be unmoved by Chamberlain's statement that Britain may be forced to take various measures. The current situation is not one that makes the British government willing to disperse its naval strength. However, the more rational among those negotiating with Japan in the East, if they know that such moves are being prepared, may also oppose any expansion of the scope of the Tianjin dispute. (Reuters, 5th)

(Paris) - This morning, Parisian newspapers discussed British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks and Japan's position on the Axis powers, and the Japanese demands were noted by public opinion. The newspaper L'Ordre published an article by the famous journalist Bertin, saying that if Japanese aggression increases and the Tokyo negotiations do not progress, then the only thing the British Prime Minister can do is to withdraw the small number of British troops stationed in Tianjin and Shanghai who cannot perform anything, and to notify Japan that if there are any more acts that harm British interests, then Britain will immediately provide large-scale assistance to General Chiang Kai-shek and implement economic sanctions. But is Chamberlain prepared to take this courageous step? His remarks are not without contradictions. Le Temps stated that the Japanese proposal to form an alliance with the Axis powers is the result of Britain's moderate posture. At present, we cannot take any action to separate Germany, Italy, and Japan. Because of the agreement with Craigie, Britain is in fact willing to let Japan seize China at will. However, Japan is not satisfied with this and is coveting Hong Kong, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaya, and Singapore. (Reuters, 5th)

(London) - The Daily Telegraph's naval correspondent, Seward, commented on the potential of the Far East's national navy today after Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that Britain might send a fleet to the Far East, saying that even today, Britain could send a fleet of warships with sufficient strength to form a navy to the Pacific Ocean, without greatly reducing Britain's naval strength in Europe and could prevent large-scale speculative actions by Japan at sea. The British government has made a firm promise to Australia to send such a fleet to Singapore if necessary. If this is implemented, then this fleet will combine with at least ten cruisers and destroyer fleets from China, Australia, and New Zealand, and fifteen of Britain's best submarines, to form an elite navy. As for the many warships that will be transferred from home and abroad to dangerous areas in the future, they have not yet been calculated. (Reuters, 5th)

(London) - The Manchester Guardian's editorial today said that Chamberlain's warning in the House of Lords was the most honest analysis of British policy in China. From his own limited perspective of viewing China as a battlefield for British and Japanese interests, Chamberlain's explanation of what the British government hopes for and fears is more accurate than usual, and Chamberlain also carefully and frankly stated that Britain will take more stringent action when Japanese threats are more intolerable than they are now. On the whole, Chamberlain's remarks are more resolute than before. In summary, no matter how strong or weak the policy is, we will suffer great losses in the Far East, but a weak policy will result in even greater losses. (Reuters, 5th)

### Chongqing Newspaper Observes British Policy

(Chongqing) - The misunderstandings of the Chinese towards British policy in China after the announcement of the Anglo-Japanese agreement are now gradually being replaced by satisfaction, and the Japanese believe that Britain does not want to let China fall. Today's Chongqing United Daily News carried an article entitled "The Trend Towards International Peace and Justice," which stated that the United States' abolition of the U.S.-Japanese commercial treaty, Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons reaffirming the invariance of U.S. policy in China, Sir Simon's appropriate remarks on Chinese currency, and Sir Robert Craigie's refusal in Tokyo to hand over the silver deposits in the British Concession in Tianjin or to prohibit the circulation of Chinese legal tender in Tianjin, and the satisfactory progress of the Moscow negotiations, all prove that the joint efforts of countries around the world in managing international peace and justice are becoming stronger and forming closer cooperation. If Japan does not realize its own mistakes, overthrow the military's hegemony, and withdraw its troops in China, then not only will China continue to resist, but also the day when the strength of peace and justice effectively contain its aggression will soon come. The article concluded, "Our final victory is beyond doubt. If we continue to resist resolutely, then international peace and justice will eventually prevail." (Reuters, 5th)

(Chongqing) - British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday have aroused two different feelings among the people here. Some people believe that the Prime Minister's candid discussion of the situation in the Far East is far more satisfactory than ambiguous declarations. Others believe that the Prime Minister's remarks may not be beneficial and may only expose Britain's inability to act in the Far East, or may encourage Japanese aggression even more. At the same time, they expressed skepticism about the British Prime Minister's statement of British impotence, believing that Britain has other ways to stop Japan besides a powerful fleet. (Reuters, 5th)

### U.S. Undersecretary of State Explains Far East Foreign Policy; The Path to Be Taken Should Still Be Decided Independently; Cooperation with Britain and the Establishment of Understanding

(Washington) - According to Undersecretary of State Welles's reply today to a question about British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on the situation in China, the United States will determine its own path in the Far East. The United States and Britain have no understanding of taking joint action in the East. Welles also declined to comment on Chamberlain's speech. (Reuters, 4th)

(Washington) - British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons today was interpreted by political figures here as an appeal to the United States to cooperate with Britain in the Far East, but it was not explicitly stated. Although the spokespersons of the U.S. government have repeatedly stated that U.S. actions maintain an independent nature and have no understanding with Britain, if the United States takes any action to inform Japan that the United States and Britain have the same views and interests in the Far East, then there would be no dissent in principle in either Congress or public opinion. Public opinion even believes that punitive measures against Japan should be implemented sooner rather than later. However, officials in the State Department believe that there is no need to take new action at present, because if Japan strikes at the interests of Western countries in the Far East again, the United States will often react. This determination can be fully demonstrated by the United States' prohibition of the transportation of arms and raw materials to Japan in six months' time, which Japan also understands. At this moment, certain U.S. newspapers and political figures are advocating sending a naval fleet to the Far East to demonstrate. In general, if the President makes this decision, public opinion will certainly support it. It is also rumored in the Congressional cloakroom that the naval fleet is about to sail to the Hawaiian Islands, but the State Department and the Navy Department say that no such decision has been made. In addition, Japan may join the military alliance treaty between Germany and Italy. After hearing this, the United States was deeply impressed. If this comes true, then President Roosevelt's view that the United States will be threatened by the joint actions of Japan, Germany, and Italy will be confirmed, and the President's position will inevitably be strengthened, it can be asserted.

### Danzig Crisis Enters Critical Stage: 150,000 German Troops Concentrated on Polish Border; Germany Seeks Italy's Attitude on Alliance Treaty; Poland Argues for Tariff Rights

(London) This morning, alarming news spread again that a large number of German troops have been concentrated on the Polish border. According to reliable sources in London, 150,000 German troops, mostly fully mechanized units, are now concentrated near Marienwerder, a location near the Polish border. Meanwhile, the "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in Prague also reported that orders had been received there that all roads under construction or repair leading to the Polish border must be completed and ready for use by August 24. Furthermore, yesterday's "News Chronicle" correspondent in Warsaw reported that, according to reliable sources, 150,000 to 160,000 German troops have been concentrated on the western border of Poland. At the same time, a large number of German troops, carrying long-range artillery, are currently stationed in Stoppen, opposite the territory of Danzig. (Reuter, 5th)

(Paris) According to well-informed sources here, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will soon meet at a selected location. This decision is being carried out by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, in accordance with the provisions of the German-Italian alliance treaty. Its nature is a step beyond ordinary diplomatic contact. It is said to have originated from Germany and is an "exchange of views" before the practical implementation of the military alliance between the two countries. From Italy's perspective, the German authorities, perhaps because the Danzig issue is entering a critical stage and could lead to war, want to know exactly what Italy's attitude is. (Havas, 5th)

(London) According to消息 received here, the Polish government has presented a note to the Danzig Senate, stating that Polish customs officials stationed at the border between the city and the province of East Prussia in Germany, who have been transferred elsewhere by the City Senate, should be immediately returned to their original posts. If this is not done, the customs surveillance line between Danzig and Germany will be abolished, which will inevitably lead to a serious situation. In addition, it is also heard that Poland has given the City Senate a deadline to submit a reply within today. Upon hearing this news, British political circles are deeply concerned about the increasingly serious situation in Danzig. As for why the Polish government has given the Danzig Senate such a short deadline, it is because Polish Commander-in-Chief General Smigly-Rydz is scheduled to deliver a speech tomorrow in Krakow to commemorate the founding of the Polish volunteer army in the early stages of the European War and is eager to know the Danzig Senate's attitude towards the customs issue. However, the draft of the speech has been finalized. General Smigly-Rydz yesterday afternoon held a long discussion with Foreign Minister Beck and the Polish Ambassador to England, Raczyński, during which the Danzig issue was discussed. Furthermore, according to news from Berlin, German military preparations are being intensified, which is another reason for the unease felt by British political circles. Considering that senior officials of the Foreign Office continue to work as usual during weekend holidays and bank holidays, and maintain contact with the capitals of relevant countries, and that Foreign Secretary Halifax will listen to reports from his subordinates by direct telephone every day, one can see how seriously the British authorities regard the situation in the Free City of Danzig.

### Hitler: The End is Nigh – Prophecy of a Parisian Astrologer

(Paris) Parisian astrological newspapers and magazines have published articles discussing the fate of German leader Hitler, saying, "If Hitler is not overthrown by a revolution on Earth, he will surely be destroyed by a revolution in the heavens." "The World of Tomorrow" newspaper said that all astrologers agree that "Hitler's star is already falling." Another magazine said, "A revolution will occur in the sky, the result of which will be to move Hitler's star from a 'circle of light' into a 'circle of darkness.'" Hitler himself is said to have told the French Ambassador to Germany, "The end of my fate is near." Among Jewish refugees in Paris, a numerical story is also circulating, saying that Hitler's end will come in 1939. This mathematical game involves adding together his year of birth, the date and time he came to power, and the year of his downfall. Half of the sum of these four numbers will be the day of his downfall. This formula has been applied to other historical figures and has always been accurate. Hitler was born in 1889, came to power in 1933, has been in power for six years, and will be 50 years old when he falls. The sum of these four numbers is 3878, and half of that is exactly 1939.

(London) The Anglo-French military mission departed from here today for Moscow to hold a trilateral staff meeting with Soviet military authorities. Soviet Ambassador to England Maisky was present to see them off. (Reuter, 5th)

(London) The political issues being discussed by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow are gradually progressing to the point where British Foreign Office envoy Strang no longer needs to stay in Moscow. Therefore, Strang will return to London within the next week. (Reuter, 5th)

### Political Kidnappings at Peiping Catholic University; Wealthy Father and Crouse Kidnapped; Motive to Force Handover of List of Students Going South

(Peiping) According to news from here today, two kidnapping cases have occurred this week at Fu Jen Catholic University (now owned by Americans). One is the school's Dean of Students, the Chinese Father Fu, and the other is the school's Academic Dean, the Dutchman Crouse. The reason for this is to threaten the school to hand over the list of students who are about to go south. The instigator is believed to be the Japanese, and the perpetrators are personnel from the "Provisional Government." Father Fu was kidnapped on Wednesday morning. At that time, Father Fu was trying to go to the main building to lead Mass when two plainclothes Chinese men appeared, kidnapped him into a car, and sped away. The university guards were panicked at the time and allowed him to be kidnapped without interference. On Thursday, two more Chinese men came to Fu Jen University and asked to see Father Crouse. When Father Crouse came out to meet them, the two Chinese men claimed that they were there to discuss the disappearance of Father Fu and asked Father Crouse to go to the police station to sign documents. Therefore, Father Crouse went with them, but when they reached a car, the two men tried to kidnap Father Crouse into the car. However, Father Crouse was six feet tall and had strength, and he knocked the two men down. At the same time, he ran back to the university, but unfortunately, his foot was tripped by his long gown, and he fell to the ground, allowing the two Chinese men to catch up and threaten him with a pistol. Therefore, he was kidnapped. Only yesterday did Father Crouse manage to notify the school authorities by telephone, saying that he was now in a Chinese prison, dirty and hot, and asked the school authorities to send clean clothes. However, he believed that he would be released soon, so he asked the school authorities not to worry. Fu Jen University has now informed the Japanese Embassy that if the two kidnapped Fathers can be released, the matter will not be made public. The Dutch chargé d'affaires has also informed the Japanese side that if the Japanese can release Father Crouse, he does not intend to ask his government to lodge a serious protest.

### General Situation of the National University Joint Enrollment in the 27th Year (Part 1) – Over 10,000 Applicants, Approximately 5,000 Admitted

(Chongqing Airmail) The unified enrollment method for national universities during this summer vacation has been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. The Ministry of Education has now compiled and investigated the applicants, admitted students, their aspirations, selected subjects, students admitted without examination, and how the Ministry of Education allocated students for the unified enrollment of national universities in the 27th year. The report statistics are very detailed. Here, we selectively record the main points.

In the past, the enrollment of new students in colleges and universities was handled separately by each school. Each school held at least one enrollment each year. Each student had to take the exams of several schools in succession when applying to universities, which was uneconomical for both school administration and individuals. In order to avoid this unreasonable phenomenon, the Ministry of Education ordered the National Central University, Wuhan University, Zhejiang University, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other schools to jointly enroll students in the 26th year. Later, due to the special circumstances of the schools in Beiping, the joint enrollment was organized by the Central, Wuhan, and Zhejiang Universities. In the 27th year, due to the war of resistance, the Ministry of Education, in order to adapt to the special environment and needs, formulated the general outline of the unified enrollment method for national universities in the 27th year in June and issued it to national universities for compliance. National vocational schools and provincial private vocational schools above the college level, after being approved by the Ministry of Education, still enrolled students on their own as in the past. There are nine regulations ((8) Graduates of this year's joint graduation examination may be recommended, and the top 15% of excellent students may be distributed to various colleges and universities without examination. (9) Students with equivalent qualifications are allowed to register for the examination for new students this year, but the number of admitted students shall not exceed 10% of the total number of admitted students). "The remaining items 1 to 7 are omitted." All colleges and universities enroll students in accordance with the regulations. The following is a separate description of the students who were admitted without examination and the students of national universities in the rear who were enrolled in Shanghai.

The examination subjects are divided into written and oral examinations. The written examination subjects are divided into three groups: "Group 1" (1) Civics, (2) Chinese, (3) English, (4) Chinese History and Geography, (5) Foreign History and Geography, (6) Mathematics (Algebra, Plane Geometry, Trigonometry), (7) Select one subject from Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Candidates for the faculties of arts, law, business, and teacher training colleges, departments of education, civics education, physical education, Chinese, English, history and geography, home economics, and art and labor vocational schools will be tested on this. "Group 2" (1) Civics, (2) Chinese, (3) English, (4) Chinese History and Geography, (5) Mathematics (Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Analytic Geometry, Trigonometry), (6) Physics, (7) Chemistry. Candidates for the faculties of engineering, departments of mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology, and civil engineering of the Faculty of Science, and departments of mathematics, physics, and chemistry of teacher training colleges will be tested on this. "Group 3" (1) Civics, (2) Chinese, (3) English, (4) Chinese History and Geography, (5) Mathematics (Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Trigonometry), (6) Biology (Foreign History and Geography instead of Biology for candidates for the Geography Department), (7) Select one subject from Physics and Chemistry. Candidates for the faculties of medicine and agriculture, departments of biology, geography, and geology of the Faculty of Science, the Department of Natural History of teacher training colleges, and dental schools will be tested on this. Candidates for schools such as Sun Yat-sen University Medical School or Tongji University will take German instead of English. Candidates for the Department of Physical Education and art vocational schools should also take an additional examination in their major subject.

Regarding the number of applicants, Guangzhou had the highest number of applicants among the twelve enrollment offices, with a total of 2,548 people. Chongqing had the second highest, with a total of 2,099 people. Chengdu was next, with a total of 1,806 people. Yongkang had the least, with a total of 191 people. The total number of applicants in the twelve enrollment offices was 11,119 people. If classified according to written examination subjects, 5,105 people applied for Group 1, accounting for 45.91% of the total number of people. 4,121 people applied for Group 2, accounting for 37.06% of the total number of people. 1,893 people applied for Group 3, accounting for 17% of the total number of people. If Group 3 is divided into science, arts, and teacher training categories, 5,898 people applied for the science category, of which the most applied for engineering, accounting for 3,773 people. 3,073 people applied for the arts category, of which the most applied for law, accounting for 2,437 people, and the least applied for business, with only 120 people. 1,648 people applied for teacher training schools. If classified according to the gender of the applicants, 9,081 were male, accounting for 81.67% of the total number of people, and 2,038 were female, accounting for 18.33% of the total number of people.

Chongqing and Guangxi Universities in the province were requested to recruit students by the Ministry of Education, and Chongqing University only announced enrollment during the examination, so the applicants did not list them as their first choice. The following is a record of the subjects chosen by the applicants in this session: (1) Science subjects, 5,898 people (3,773 in engineering, 539 in science, 978 in agriculture, 608 in medicine), accounting for 53.05%.

Yesterday was the fourth day of the Exhibition of Fine Prints of Western Paintings.

It is said that in addition to the original famous works on display, the exhibition has also added special issues, including fifty works by famous artists such as Milan, Taiga, Savonu, and Raphael. A thick catalog is also given away with the tickets. The catalog classifies the famous works displayed in this exhibition in detail and records them in great detail. It is no different from a simple history of art. Also, the exhibition is aware of the educational value of this exhibition, so it has specially made preferential arrangements for students. For groups of ten or more people who contact the exhibition in advance in the name of the school, the ticket fee can be reduced by one-third. There is only one day left for the exhibition, which happens to be a weekly holiday. It is expected that those who want to visit will be even more enthusiastic.

### The Panic Over New Banknotes Has Not Dissipated; Funds are Again Seeking Ways to Escape; US Dollar Approaches the 8 Yuan Mark; Pound Sterling Nears Four "辦士"

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed rates. In the unofficial markets, following news from foreign telegrams that the Ministry of Finance had instructed the Bank of England to print 100 million new banknotes, public anxiety remained high. Moreover, aggressive absorption by Yokohama Specie Bank, the Chinese Merchants' Cotton Mill Association, and others, coupled with requests from Hong Kong, and HSBC's reluctance to sell except at premium prices, led to a tightening of the market. The pound sterling once tightened to Four "辦士" and .0625, while the US dollar broke through the 8 yuan barrier, retreating to 7.875. The buying spree subsided slightly at noon, and the market stabilized somewhat, closing with the pound sterling at Four "辦士" and .09375, and the US dollar at 7.9375. The forward market for the current month saw strong buying interest from Chinese merchants and speculators, as well as Japanese banks, driving the pound sterling through the Four "辦士" mark. In the end, the pound sterling tightened by .21875, and the US dollar softened by .4375, with some fluctuations in between, but no major waves. Trading was quite active during the morning. Hong Kong dollar conditions were also somewhat chaotic, with the final bank selling price contracting to 28.25 yuan.

Chinese and Japanese Merchants Compete to Purchase

Early in the morning, London spot and forward rates were both .0625 higher. New York silver prices were stagnant. London gold prices remained flat. Exchange rates between the pound and the dollar were unchanged, and down slightly, about .00125, against Shanghai and unchanged against the French franc. The US dollar was flat against both the British pound and the French franc, and down by .02 against Shanghai. The central government's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price for the pound sterling at Four "辦士" and .25, and for the US dollar at 8.25 yuan, the pound sterling tightened by .046875 compared to the previous day, and the US dollar softened by .0625. After opening, the market tightened slightly as foreign firms settled accounts. Foreign firms settled spot pound sterling at Four "辦士" .25 and .12875, and spot US dollars at 8.21875. Although the Chinese Merchants' Cotton Mill Association also came to settle accounts, the market temporarily hardened because foreign firms were still willing to sell. Jardine Matheson, Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, and Banque Franco-Chinoise sold spot US dollars at 8.25 to the Chinese Merchants' Cotton Mill Association. Simultaneously, an American bank sold spot US dollars to another bank at 8.28125, along with pound sterling for the current month at Four "辦士" and .0625. When HSBC's listed rates were revealed late in the day, there were no fluctuations. It was announced that the silver equalization tax would continue to be waived. Subsequently, the market tightened again as Japanese banks suddenly began absorbing currencies, and foreign firms' willingness to sell waned. The Yokohama Specie Bank settled spot pound sterling at Four "辦士" and .1875 from foreign firms. Telegrams from Hong Kong also began to arrive, adding to the aggressive buying. As Chinese merchants and Japanese banks continued their activities, the situation tightened further. Japanese banks and telegrams from Hong Kong bought spot pound sterling from foreign firms like HSBC, with prices tightening from Four "辦士" and .125 to .0625. They also purchased spot US dollars from a certain bank, with prices shrinking from 8 yuan to 7.875. Later, the Yokohama Specie Bank bought pound sterling for the current month at Three "辦士" and .96875 from foreign firms like Banque Belge pour l'Étranger. Soon after, it settled US dollars for the current month at 7.6875 and .625 from a certain bank with Chinese merchants. By then, it was noon. Reports indicated that the selling price of spot Hong Kong dollars had contracted to 28.25 yuan. At the noon close, the selling price of spot pound sterling was Four "辦士" and .09375, and for US dollars, 7.9375 yuan. Pound sterling for the current month was at Three "辦士" .0625, and US dollars at 7.5625 yuan. As a result, spot pound sterling tightened by .103125 compared to the previous day, while US dollars softened by .375. Pound sterling for the current month softened by .21875, and US dollars strengthened by .4375. There was no market in the afternoon due to it being Saturday.

Hong Kong Dollar Exchange Rate Rises Sharply

Hong Kong, 5th – The exchange market opened steadily today. Rates for the British pound and Japanese yen were unchanged. The US dollar forward rate contracted by .0625, to 28.5 yuan.

The Shanghai dollar exchange rate rose another 2 yuan, to 350 yuan, a total increase of 14 yuan for the half-day. There will be no market this afternoon due to Saturday and next Monday.

Tianjin Exchange Market Also Contracts

Tianjin, 5th – The exchange market opened weakly today, contracting by .025 against the British pound, to 3 "辦士" and .375, and tightening by .5 yuan against the US dollar, to 6.5625 yuan. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate rose by 5 yuan, to 127 yuan. The unofficial rate for "Joint Banknotes" rose by 1.5 yuan, to 101 yuan.

### One Hundred Million New Banknotes—A Mystery

The Reuters report of 100 million new banknotes caused a dramatic shift in Shanghai's financial circles. Gold prices have risen by 255 yuan in two days, the US dollar exchange rate has contracted by .46875 in two days, and the British pound exchange rate has contracted by .234375. Yarn prices have soared, government bonds have plummeted, and foreign currencies have risen rapidly, with the pound sterling reaching 93 yuan and the US dollar reaching 97 yuan. While the market shares a common sense of panic regarding these 100 million new banknotes, there is also a sense of mystery. Some speculate that it will further inflate the currency, while others believe that a portion of it is treasury bonds intended specifically for purchasing foreign exchange. Some also speculate that it is for preparing for currency consolidation after the war, while others say that it is to replenish the market after the gradual contraction of mixed currency. There are also those who say that since the centralization of banknote issuance, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications still issue banknotes. In the future, all banknotes should be issued by the Central Bank alone, so the Central Bank is printing such a large amount of banknotes. Given the current volatile state of public sentiment, any news can fuel speculation. It is thought that this matter will be clarified soon, and that the majority of the banknotes are still being printed in London.

### One US Dollar Valued at 97 Legal Tender Yuan

Yesterday, the shortage and high prices of foreign exchange caused British and American gold pounds to rise sharply. The pound sterling stood at 93.5 yuan, and the US dollar at 97 yuan. The demand for British and American gold notes was even stronger, and the market was firm, with British gold notes at 58 yuan and US gold notes at 13.06 yuan. The demand for Hong Kong notes and French franc notes was also strong, and they also rose. Singapore notes, Dutch notes, and others followed suit. Japanese gold notes also trended firmer, reaching 1.09 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes also rose, reaching 0.89 yuan in the evening market. In exchange transactions, only Qin Tai sold 500 yuan of US gold notes to Xiang Feng. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds and British gold notes each rise by 2.5 yuan, US gold pounds rise by 4 yuan, US gold notes rise by 0.41 yuan, Hong Kong notes rise by 0.13 yuan, French franc notes rise by 0.0031 yuan, Singapore notes and Dutch notes each rise by 0.3 yuan, Annam notes, Rupi notes, and German gold notes each rise by 0.1 yuan, Canadian notes rise by 0.8 yuan, Philippine notes rise by 0.2 yuan, Italian notes rise by 0.02 yuan, and Australian gold notes rise by 2 yuan. Only Siamese notes remained unchanged.

### Foreign Exchange Tightens to Maintained Price; Gold Soars to the Skies

Yesterday, the unofficial cash gold market saw an intensification of rising prices, nearly breaking through the 3,900 yuan barrier. However, fluctuations were quite rapid, rising and falling intermittently, generally shifting with the tightening and loosening of foreign exchange. Initially, the market opened with a continued softening of foreign exchange, coupled with persistent rumors about the Ministry of Finance's additional printing of new banknotes in England. Moreover, some outside the industry, seeing the upward trend, also came to purchase, resulting in an overwhelming buying atmosphere that caused a sudden jump of 105 yuan, opening at the 3,800 yuan barrier. Subsequently, foreign exchange suddenly rebounded slightly, triggering a selling wave. A certain gold firm (acting for speculators) and other gold firms rushed to sell, causing the market to weaken and plummet to a low of 3,730 yuan. Around 9:45 AM, news broke that foreign exchange was tightening sharply, approaching the HSBC maintained supply price for the Exchange Equalization Fund. Buying surged again, and money exchange firms and wealthy merchants aggressively absorbed gold. Securities firms also bought more than they sold, and sellers raised prices significantly, causing a dramatic surge to a high of 3,895 yuan. At noon, foreign exchange flattened, and a certain money exchange firm aggressively sold dozens of taels, pulling back to 3,855 yuan at the noon close. As a result, cash gold soared by another 160 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no formal market in the afternoon. It was reported that transactions outside the market were being made at 3,867 yuan. There were about 600 taels of light volume and wholesale transactions. Jewelry gold was ultimately listed 15 yuan higher. Customs gold and Sino-British fine gold remained unchanged.

Cash Gold Rises by 160 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened with a jump of 105 yuan due to reports that foreign exchange continued to tighten, strengthening investor confidence. Securities firms were very willing to buy, and sellers were optimistic about the future. A securities firm bought 10 taels from a gold firm at a price of 3,800 yuan. Subsequently, news that foreign exchange had rebounded slightly caused buyers to become scarce, and a gold firm acting on behalf of speculators took profits, and other gold firms were also willing to sell. Consequently, prices fell sharply, soon plummeting 70 yuan. A gold firm sold 20 taels to jewelry firms at a price of 3,730 yuan, which was the low of the day. Around 9:40 AM, news broke that foreign exchange was trending tighter, reigniting buying interest. A certain gold firm also stopped selling and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Prices rose 70 yuan. A securities firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange firm at a price of 3,800 yuan. At that time, a certain jewelry store sold on behalf of a customer, causing prices to slump slightly. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange firm at a price of 3,792 yuan, then sold 10 taels to a securities firm at a price of 3,790 yuan. Thereafter, news spread that the tightening of foreign exchange was intensifying, and sellers raised prices even more, causing prices to rise again, soaring another 105 yuan. A securities firm bought 20 taels from a money exchange firm at a price of 3,895 yuan, which was the high of the day. Near noon, news broke that the tightening of foreign exchange had stopped and rebounded slightly. A certain money exchange firm sold dozens of taels aggressively, causing prices to fall slightly by 40 yuan. A money exchange firm sold 20 taels to a certain gold firm at a price of 3,855 yuan, which was the noon closing price. As a result, cash gold soared by 160 yuan compared to the previous day. There were fluctuations of 165 yuan in the morning. The cash gold price of cash gold firms was about 10 yuan higher, while the spot gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. It was reported that there were few deals being made.

Jewelry Gold Listed 15 Yuan Higher

The selling price of jewelry gold was initially 375 yuan at Da Tong Heng and others. At 9:37, it suddenly increased by 10 yuan, fell back by 5.5 yuan and fifty cents, and then increased by another 5 yuan at 11:00. At 11:40, it increased by another 5 yuan, and at 11:57, it increased by another 5 yuan, before falling back by 5 yuan at 12:10. After that, there were no further changes. In total, it increased by 15 yuan. Da Si Heng and others listed it at 390 yuan, while Xin Tong Heng was at 388 yuan, reducing the purchase price by about 11 yuan.

### Discount Rate Increases by Another 10 Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange notes suddenly rose again, hovering around 200 yuan per thousand yuan all day, with uncertain fluctuations. Early in the morning, it was as high as 190 yuan. Those in need of cash were willing to pay a high price to discount their notes, causing it to soar to 210 yuan. It gradually returned to 195 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, it once again rose to 200 yuan, finally closing at 195 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The Shanghai Money Industry Association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 0.2% in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Foodstuffs

### Rice Merchants Are Fighting Limit Pricing; Rice Firms Advise Compliance with Limit Prices; Rice Shops Adopt a Passive Stance; Transport and Marketing Cooperation Manipulates the Shanghai Rice Market

Since off-market transactions became prevalent, breaking limit prices and soaring to 23-24 yuan, most rice shops still sell at the limit price. However, under the current circumstances, it is impossible to purchase goods at the limit price, putting rice firms in a difficult situation. Yesterday, they advised fellow rice firms in the market to register and suspend transactions that exceeded the limit price, pending handling by the concession authorities. The situation was tense, and market operations were suspended again. However, according to industry insiders, industry firms are in an intermediate position, transferring goods with rice firms for only a commission of .011 yuan. Limit prices being exceeded is a matter of rice firms breaking their own rules, allowing traders to hoard goods for speculation. If rice firms can comply with the limit price, then where is the room for industry firms in the middle to raise prices? In short, such situations only consider one's own private interests, without considering the people's food, leading to the current situation. Since market transactions were effectively suspended, yesterday they called several famous rice mills to buy rice, asking "Do you have good rice?" The answer was, "No." Asked, "What is the price of rice?" the answer was "20 yuan." Asked "Is the rice good?" the answer was "Not tasty." Further questions received no response. Asking five or six shops yielded the same response, suggesting that the rice shops had prepared their answers in advance. The question remained as to how they managed to "speak in unison." However, according to investigations, the rice mills of a certain large rice factory on Mei Bai Ge Road have been grinding rice all day long, and the second floor is piled high with bags. How can they say that there is no rice? However, they are unwilling to sell it for 20 yuan per picul. It is likely that old customers can buy it, with old stock at 21.34 yuan and fresh stock at around 22 yuan. However, if one is a new customer or asks by telephone, they all answer that there is no stock. The rice shops are being so cautious, fearing that someone will investigate and say they are violating the limit price. In fact, this kind of behavior is nothing more than an attempt to relax the limit price, and even a one or two yuan increase is not enough to satisfy their desires. After the rice panic following the August 13th incident, rice shops learned their lesson and do not want to keep too much rice in their shops or publicly store rice in their warehouses, as they can be investigated. Therefore, they distribute the rice in various places to avoid scrutiny and ensure safety. Now, they are coordinating with rice dealers. Rice dealers are unwilling to show samples unless they are guaranteed a certain amount of sales. Rice shops are claiming that they cannot get any rice, selling off all their existing stock. Transport and marketing cooperation is manipulating the Shanghai rice market, causing even more public anxiety, unwittingly falling into the rice merchants' trap, allowing rice merchants to speak with confidence, and the limit price is relaxed without even being requested. Earlier, there was still a lot of rice in the hands of customers and traders, so rice merchants also advocated registering national households. Afterwards, the customers' rice was gradually sold off due to mold and steaming, and it has already entered the hands of rice merchants. Therefore, there is no news of pursuing the traders anymore. In short, there are two reasons for the rise in rice prices. Rice merchants want to raise the price of locally produced rice to the same level as imported goods. Secondly, they collude with certain parties, echoing each other and performing a "duet" to threaten the lives of Shanghai residents, forcing them to return to the mainland in order to fulfill a certain party's plan to "revive" the mainland. Under these circumstances, there was no trade in goods yesterday. River rice arrived, arriving from the South Port Gang No. 4, with cartwheel bags of South Gang goods, 1,100 to 1,200 bags.

Yesterday's unofficial customer rice market was already extinct. Due to the Rice Shop Association dispatching personnel to advise rice shops not to buy above the limit, there were no unofficial transactions for Jingwu high rice, which was at 18-19 yuan a few days ago. The transactions for rough rice at 16 yuan and below were also few. Also, it is rumored that there is hope that Wumi will be re-authorized, and the public's confidence in the market is returning, and the asking price is slightly flatter.

Imported Rice – The production prices differ greatly, so new transactions will be difficult to realize in the short term. The dealers' minds are very strong, and there is no sample of new or old Saigon rice.

### Flour Is Sold for Cash Only; Wheat Rises Another 2 Jiao

Flour – Northern ocean firms transferred up to 50,000 bags of flour over several days. Therefore, the factories temporarily stopped supplying flour. On the other hand, they raised the wholesale price on the market again, from 5.2 Jiao to 5.3 Jiao. Basic/customer purchases are only cash-based. Therefore, yesterday's transactions only amounted to about 20,000 bags purchased by local firms and scattered firms from the interior. There are 27,000 bags being transported to Tianjin today.

Wheat – The amount of existing stocks is less than in previous years, so the market price rose by 1 Jiao. It is estimated that Fukufu and Liang factories bought 5 carts of Jingwu, Danyang and other wheat, at prices of 7 to 6.85 yuan. Hoarding firms bought 6 carts of Nanjing, Puzhen, Suzhou, Kunshan and other wheat, at prices of 7.25 to 6.85 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton

### Also Related to the Newly Printed Banknotes: Yarn Prices Soar; Double Horse Breaks the 600 Yuan Barrier

The rise in the yarn market is strangely rapid, because a stream of positive news is arriving on the market. It is said that English companies in London are undertaking to print a very large amount of Chinese legal tender, foreign exchange is shrinking, and gold is rising again, stimulating confidence. The buying momentum is suddenly vigorous, and the market is temporarily dry. Sellers are at a loss, and capital is becoming increasingly scarce. The market price is therefore rising sharply, and new peaks are emerging endlessly. 20-count Double Horse breaks through 603 yuan, 7 yuan higher than the previous trading day's opening price. The distance between less popular yarns and popular goods is widening. Therefore, although the price is cheap, general operators do not buy yarn in bulk, because their trend is too stagnant.

Spot yarn immediately rises by 5-6 yuan at the market opening. 20-count Double Horse warehouse receipts are 576 yuan, and existing spot yarn on the spot market is 590 yuan. Rumors are soon flying, and buyers are rushing to be first, and the market is driven by this momentum. There is an image of yarn shortages, and selling prices are advancing section by section. In an instant, Double Horse passes 600 yuan, but secret, shouted buying voices are still the most common. Until the closing price, the highest price is 603 yuan, and warehouse receipts are 591 yuan. The market is up 17 yuan for 20-count Double Horse, 13.5 yuan for Shepherd, and 15 yuan for Double Earth. Shenxin factory opened with 1,900 bags of 20-count Double Horse, at a price of 590 yuan, with a deposit of 10 foreign yuan per bag. Today, 1,370 cotton yarn pieces are transported to Tianjin, 5 pieces to Hong Kong, 190 pieces to Beihai, 65 pieces to Haiphong, and 110 pieces to Siam. The amount purchased by the various firms is listed below:

The Japanese yarn market is also soaring. Upon investigation, this is because there is a spot yarn shortage and hoarding merchants are accumulating stocks. Also, there are many rumors, and buyers are willing to crowd in. The opening price for 20-count Yueqin was 467 yuan this month, and the closing price was 472 yuan.

### Foreign Cotton is Entirely

### Collected by Japanese Merchants: Fire Machine Flower Opens at 95 Yuan

Transactions for Chinese and foreign cotton continue to progress. Japanese factories are buying large amounts from firms. The complexity of their collection is double the scale of Chinese factories. Sales prices are therefore rising step by step. Market prices have risen another 3-4 yuan compared to what they were. The Chinese merchant Xinyu factory bought 600 bales of Tongzhou-packed cotton, at a price of 95 yuan (delivered to the warehouse in banknotes). Other merchants are actively buying and selling between themselves. 200 bales of Fire Machine Flower have also been transacted, at a price of 95 yuan (delivered to the warehouse in banknotes). Sources of cotton in Northern Jiangsu are thriving again. 631 bales of fine cotton from Tongzhou have arrived. The current situation for current cotton transactions is recorded below.

Another report says that transactions for foreign cotton in Shanghai have become bustling in recent days. Although Chinese factories also have small amounts of transactions, Japanese factories purchase the large majority. Nearly half of the ready goods owned by merchants has been purchased by Japanese factories. The gradual increase in selling prices in recent days is because the current stock in the city is being depleted day by day. It is predicted that cotton prices still have the potential to rise in the coming days.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was initially very quiet. Later, due to news of price drops from Liverpool, speculators seized the opportunity to buy, while small short covering orders arose at the same time. Midway, Liverpool and Bombay reported good news, and weather reports from cotton-growing regions were bad. Therefore, the market temporarily turned good. When the market closed, it ultimately fell due to the dumping of cotton by overseas merchants and short-covering, and prices fell 7-10 British points compared to the previous trading day. Indian shipping is expected to fall 1 Rupee, and Egyptian cotton will rise 7-8 British points.

### Securities

### Foreign Stocks Continue to Advance, Domestic Bonds Fall More Severely

Yesterday's securities gray market saw continued declines, which were more severe than before. More transactions are occurring, but they are still not very lively. Generally, people think that foreign exchange is tightening again and gold is rising, but according to precedent, government bond market prices generally move in the opposite direction. In fact, given the already realized currency inflation, and the recent order of 100 million banknotes from the United Kingdom, the amount of currency in circulation will increase even more in the future. The discount will naturally trend to a standard level, and credit will also naturally loosen. Therefore, the bond market has good prospects, but it is feared that it will not be achieved in a short amount of time. Yesterday, due to special reasons, the issuance of Numbers 11 and 49 was most vigorous, and there was also selling in Numbers 25 and 42. Runli also had a slight supply. Numbers 5 and Hengfu Tiansheng were buying the most, and individual investors were also absorbing a fair amount. As a result, prices continue to fall, falling between 7.5 Jiao and 1.1+ yuan. The total number of transactions is estimated to be 400,000-500,000 yuan. London Chinese foreign bonds are still steady, with no change. A summary table is listed below.

Stock Transactions: 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company shares were transacted, at a price of 8.55 yuan.

Another report from the Shanghai Public Exchange said that the stock market continued to advance yesterday morning, and prices increased. The transaction prices for ordinary stocks were slightly higher. Transactions of British Jardine Matheson rubber stocks were particularly active, and the closing transaction price was 24.25 yuan. The rise in stock prices seems to be due to the slight tightening of foreign exchange, leading to more buying sentiment for various rubber stocks.

On the 4th of this month (Friday), the listed market prices of stocks for British Far East companies in London had further declines. The price of shares in the Mercantile Bank of India declined by 2 shillings and 6 pence, to 6 pounds and 15 shillings. The price of Hong Kong-registered shares in HSBC Bank declined by 1 pound, to 76 pounds. Rubber shares in Gula Kerling (Kuala Gula) declined by 4.5 pence, to 17 shillings and 9 pence. There were no other changes.

### Oil Cakes

### Raw Oil Sales Are Thriving; Prices Increase Sharply by 2-3 Yuan; Soybean Oil Market Slightly Recovers

Sales of raw oil to various firms in the city, Hong Kong and the interior have suddenly increased. The market price increased sharply by 2-3 yuan. A total of 300 pieces of Jiaozhou Loulou packed oil were transacted, at 43 yuan, and 41-42 yuan for oil transferred to the warehouse. 4,700 Cans of Qingdao tinned oil were transacted, with prices rising from 51 yuan to 53.5 yuan. Also, 55 barrels of barrelled oil were sold at 54 to 55.5 yuan, 12 barrels of second-packaged oil were sold at 53.7 yuan, and 200 Cans of Tianjin tinned oil at 51 yuan.

The soybean oil market has become slightly stable. A shipment of oil from Kobe, even with delivery costs added in, was 47.8 yuan. Over 500 barrels were transacted. Jiaozhou Loulou packed oil rose by .3 yuan, to 34.3 yuan, and 200 pieces were transacted.

Exports: On the 6th, 380 bags of soybeans and 700 bags of peanut kernels will be transported to Xiangman Port.

### Textiles

### Cotton Cloth Purchasing Suddenly Booms: Longtou Fine Cloth Sets New Price

Domestic Cloth: The foreign exchange market has tightened sharply, and thoughts of transacting are very vigorous. Heavyweight coarse cloth and coarse twill have risen by about .5 yuan, and light weight coarse cloth has risen by about 0.15 yuan. Fine cloth and fine twill factory prices have risen by .5 yuan. Many are still refusing orders. Second-hand goods in the market have been raised by at least 0.2-0.3 yuan. Dyed cloth and dyed twill sales have temporarily stopped because the price of white cloths has changed so drastically. Market firms, dyeing factories, and hoarding firms in this street bought more than 500 pieces of white fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth during the day. They also bought over 200 pieces of bleached cloth and unfinished cloth. Customer demand is not vigorous. Firms from Shandong bought 50 bags of 16-pound coarse cloth, firms from Sichuan and Yunnan bought over 10 boxes of printed fabric, and firms from Guangdong and Hong Kong bought over 100 pieces of Begee, colored twill, Red Mark, and fine twill. Firms from Subei Taizhou bought over 2,000 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth. Firms from the interior, such as Changzhou and Hangzhou, bought 3,000-4,000 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, Yuchou, Begee, and Zhigong.

Eastern Cloth: Although actual sales of fine cloth and fine twill have been weak yesterday, hoarding has become even more vigorous. Everyone is eagerly buying, driving prices higher. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth hit a new record of 17.25 yuan this month. The next month's price is 17.45 yuan. Mid-level and lower-level miscellaneous-brand fine cloths have also jumped by 0.5-0.6 yuan per piece. Fine twill is up 0.25-0.5 yuan per piece. In the end, capital was depleted, and only 500-600 pieces were transacted in this street. Gongda Yarn Mill opened with 300 bags of 12-pound Dragon Pearl fine cloth spot goods, at 16.25 yuan. Yiteng booked 100 bags of Flying Fish fine cloth for the next month, at a price of 16.8 yuan. The price for the next month's order actually requires a massive 17.5 yuan.

Exports: On the 6th, 6 textiles were exported to Hong Kong, 6 to Guangzhou Bay, 55 to Beihai, and 285 to Xuanxuan.

### Sugar Market: There Are Rumors of Added Taxes on Sugar

### Imported Sugar Universally Recovers

Yesterday's sugar market, according to a London wire, closed at 0.575 to 0.75 British points. December at 5 shillings, 11.575 British points; March of next year at 6 shillings, 0.025 British points; June at 6 shillings, 0.01 British point. In this city, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce transaction was done on the premise that prices had been steadily falling for the past few days and firms had resumed their appetite for transactions. For this reason, the price for re-exported goods of No. 24 raw white sugar, one of the grades, rose again one yuan to approximately 24.35 yuan in total for 200 bags, plus another 200 bags traded at 24.6 yuan; it finally rose to 25 yuan and 200 bags. Spot sugar rose .7 yuan, with this warehouse's at 33 yuan, and the outside warehouses' at 32.8 yuan. Tai Koo car white rose unevenly by .3-.5 yuan. Dongzhan's "B" mark was at 37.5 yuan; Xizhan's at 38 yuan, C.W. mark at 37.5, C.X. mark at 37.3, D.Y. mark at 37, H.X. mark at 36.8, H mark sugar and car mine were still at 22.5 yuan. Dutch red carmine's existing cash was at 28.5 yuan, a rise of two Jiao and re-export at 22, up by 3 Jiao. The stock of Main cotton white of Zhengji (Brand) No. 1 was 33 yuan, and brands No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 were the same as before. Wood No. 1 Crystal Brand at 39 yuan, and Jing Ming Crystal Brand at 40.5 yuan, both rising by a half yuan. Upon investigation, imported sugar rose due to rumors of increased taxes in Tianjin. Also, this city fears the related connection, hence the raise.

### Silk and Tea: Heavy Taxes and Levies Make it Difficult to Lower Silk Prices

Recently, the overseas silk market has been affected by the New York raw silk statistics for the past month, which showed an increase of more than 10,000 bales of silk in stock in the United States. The prices of silk in both Japan and the United States have simultaneously declined. The spot price of 85-fineness Japanese silk has fallen by 9 fen since July 31st of last month, while 75-fineness silk has fallen by 8 fen. Guangdong silk has fallen by 6 fen. The spot price of Shanghai silk has not yet been released. The recent futures price in New York has fallen slightly by 1 jiao and 0.05 li, while the long-term price has fallen by 9 fen. The spot price in Yokohama fell by 20 yuan yesterday, a decrease of 65 yuan compared to the end of July, while the long-term price fell by approximately 20 yuan. The impact has reached Shanghai. Furthermore, with the exchange rate gradually stabilizing, the exchange rate in Shanghai is lower than the previous week. However, the Shanghai silk market has various complex reasons of its own (such as white silk factories from the interior needing to pay a donation of 200 yuan when coming to Shanghai, plus 15 yuan for transportation fees, and nearly 20 yuan for certain movement fees, etc.). Therefore, the price of silk has not decreased accordingly, and the silk market has quietly entered a wait-and-see situation.

Today, there are 15 shipments of raw silk being transported to Hong Kong, as well as 10 shipments of tea.

### Due to the Evil Deeds of Traitors, the Market Fluctuated Again Yesterday: Facts Prove That the Legal Tender Reserve is Sufficient; There is No Inflation Phenomenon in the Market

Since the Chinese government has been making every effort to maintain the value of the legal tender, the national finance has become more and more stable. Now, due to a rumor that the British are printing Chinese banknotes, traitors in the Shanghai financial market are causing disturbances. However, facts prove that there is no inflation. It is hoped that all sectors will have no doubts. The details are as follows:

Evil Deeds of Traitors Cause Market Fluctuations

Since Reuters in London reported that the Chinese government and two British banknote printing companies had signed a contract to print more than 100 million banknotes, speculators in the Shanghai financial market deliberately spread rumors and manipulated the market in order to profit. As a result, huge fluctuations occurred in the black market for foreign exchange, the black market for gold, etc. (1) In the black market for foreign exchange, the exchange rate posted by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation remained unchanged, but the actual market rate shrank, with the exchange rate for British currency being 4 pence and 25, and the exchange rate for US currency being 8.25 yuan. (2) In the black market for securities, the closing prices in the morning were 54.40 yuan for Unified Class A, 43.80 yuan for Class B, 41.85 yuan for Class C, 40.03 yuan for Class D, and 41.01 yuan for Class E, a decrease of 0.70 yuan to 1.50 yuan. (3) The closing price of gold was 3,855 yuan.

Facts Prove That There is No Inflation

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the issuance of Chinese legal tender totaled 26,269,293,300 yuan by the end of June this year. The cash reserve is above 44%, which is still higher than the cash reserves of most countries. Moreover, the government has repeatedly stated that it is determined to maintain the value of the legal tender with all its strength, and has made full preparations for the occupied areas. All foreign payments are still based on the legal tender. Some parties may fear inflation, but the government's measures are the opposite of this. The legal foreign exchange rate has always been maintained, and there is a feeling of insufficient chips in the various markets, with no phenomenon of inflation.

Maintaining the Legal Tender Earns Praise

The credit of Chinese legal tender has always been unshakeable, and it is sufficient to strengthen the people's belief in the legal tender, which can indirectly strengthen the people's belief in the government. Now, the people in the occupied areas are all happy to hide legal tender in order to protect their property. This is due to the maintenance of the credit of the legal tender. Therefore, the government has never resorted to monetary policy for the War of Resistance, and has earned the praise of Chinese and foreign figures for opening up tax sources, such as establishing new taxes and reorganizing old taxes, and issuing various public bonds. Maintaining the value of the legal tender is especially praised by all parties, because if the legal price of the legal tender is broken, not only will the government lose a very good asset, but it will also lose the people's belief in the government.

Adding New Banknotes Has Two Meanings

The Zi Lin Newspaper says that regarding the Chinese government's order of more than 100 million banknotes from two banknote printing companies in London, although the local Chinese banking community has not received the news, a well-known banker recently told reporters and provided several suggestions for reference regarding the intention of the Chinese authorities to print these banknotes: (1) All or part of the new currency may be "foreign exchange" currency, which is circulated by China in the Chinese market exclusively for the purchase of foreign exchange, so as to prevent the people from exchanging legal tender for foreign exchange, which would benefit the Japanese. If this suggestion becomes a reality, then no one in the country may purchase foreign exchange without Chongqing's approval. (2) Chongqing's printing of new banknotes may be aimed at replacing the old and damaged banknotes currently in circulation. The banker claimed that when he was in the United States, he saw an American banknote printing company printing 500 million banknotes per day. This does not mean that the United States needs so many new currencies every day. Bankers who order a large number of new banknotes may circulate them in the market from time to time to replace the old banknotes withdrawn from the market.

### Taking Strict Precautions to Prevent Disturbances on "August 13th": All Defense Forces Have Agreed on Preventive Measures; All Troops and Detectives Stationed in Shanghai Will Be Mobilized

The second anniversary of the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle is approaching in the blink of an eye. Because the police authorities of the two concessions had several incidents of hooligans disrupting newspapers last month, they took joint precautions in late last month and dispatched armored vehicles and detectives to conduct emergency searches at any time, which was quite effective. Therefore, the authorities will still implement this special measure during this anniversary period to ensure security within the boundaries. At the same time, from today until the 16th, any gatherings, associations, parades, and other activities of any organization will be prohibited for 11 days. During this period, detectives will be stationed in various public places to monitor. It is heard that some roads will still be blocked, mobilizing the garrison troops and the armored vehicles of the business community to patrol the districts, and paying special attention to the defense of areas adjacent to the Chinese territory. The martial law will be strictly enforced, and posts and patrols will be increased on various roads to strengthen the defense. The Japanese have also added barbed wire and other obstacles on various bridges in Hongkou and in quiet places in the suburbs.

Various Defense Forces Discuss Detailed Rules for Martial Law

The Zi Lin Newspaper says that the commanders of the various defense forces in Shanghai met yesterday morning (the 4th) to discuss the detailed rules for the precautions to be taken here to avoid any unforeseen events on the anniversary of the Shanghai Battle from August 9th to 13th. This decision on precautions is somewhat different from last year's precautions, but the specifics are not yet known. According to reliable sources, the precautions this year may be slightly tightened due to the possible attempts of existing terrorists in the two concessions, but they will be somewhat similar to last year's methods. It is also heard that although the curfew will be strictly enforced during the period of martial law, it will not be advanced.

The Entire City of Shanghai is Fully Mobilized

The Shanghai Times says that in view of the recent numerous bold terrorist incidents in the two concessions and the areas outside the boundaries, and the armed hooligans are using the concessions and the Chinese territory for political activities, it is heard that the authorities of the two concessions will continue to strengthen precautionary measures on the second anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai Battle. According to some sources, the entire city of Shanghai will be mobilized to cope with this emergency period.

Taking Special Protective Measures

However, official sources only report that the authorities are carefully studying the situation and will repeat the precautions for the anniversary. August 13th is a Sunday and the second anniversary of the outbreak of war in the Shanghai area. It is widely believed that terrorists will try to use this day to engage in activities. Past experience has shown that such anniversaries often lead to acts of violence, so special precautions and protective measures must be taken, otherwise disturbances are almost inevitable.

Strict Curfew and Searches Everywhere

It is expected that the state of emergency for the anniversary in the concession area will extend from August 9th to 15th, during which a strict curfew will be enforced. The authorities of the two concessions will cooperate closely, as with the current active control of Edward Road. Stone fortifications have been built at several key points, and troops will be stationed in the fortifications to defend them during the anniversary. The barbed wire obstacles that are now commonly seen will undoubtedly be erected at the entrances to the concessions. Although this may be inconvenient for the public, it has definitely proven to be important in assisting the military police in performing their duties. Pedestrians, vehicles, and the alleys and hostels where terrorists may hide or engage in secret discussions will be inspected.

The Shanghai Volunteer Corps is Actively Preparing

Close watch will be maintained on places where violence has occurred in the past and commercial institutions that have received threatening letters. The US Marine Corps, British and French troops, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will all be mobilized and will operate in their respective defense zones. It is believed that all units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will engage in active military duties, not just be on standby. The White Russian Unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will operate in the central area of the Bund and the Old City area, and guard the obstacles. The reserve team of the police department will also be called out to perform active duties.

Entertainment Venues Will Also Be Closed

During this emergency period, most Chinese rooftop gardens and entertainment venues will be temporarily closed to commemorate the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle and to prevent undesirable elements from mixing with customers. Many theaters will also be closed on August 13th, as they were last year. In the area north of the Suzhou Creek, Japanese soldiers will conduct searches and patrols.

### Comforting Refugees and Commending Martyrs: People in Occupied Areas Suffer; Disaster-Stricken Refugees are Actively Being Relieved

Since the War of Resistance, soldiers have sacrificed their lives and followed one another in death. Their loyalty and martyrdom are truly enough to move ghosts and gods and shock heaven and earth. If their deeds are allowed to be lost and not passed down, how can we commend loyalty and martyrdom? Therefore, a special order has been issued to investigate the military and civilians and officials who have died in the line of duty since the War of Resistance, and it is stipulated that in the future, whenever there are such incidents of death, a form should be filled out and presented at any time and on any occasion. Gatherings should be held to mourn the heroic deaths. Those who have died heroically and whose merits lie in the Party and the country should be reported to the local government for commendation in order to honor hidden virtues and encourage future generations. Furthermore, the people in the occupied areas have suffered all kinds of insults and humiliation, and must feel great pain in their spirits. After the recovery of the occupied counties and cities in each war zone, personnel should be sent immediately to comfort them, and together with the military and political authorities, actively relieve the disaster-stricken refugees.

### The Situation on North Jiangxi Road is Quiet; The Number of People Moving Has Decreased

The residents of the shops and houses on North Jiangxi Road, from the north end of the Waterworks Bridge in the south to the east end of Old Bazi Road in the north, were extremely panicked when the area was blocked off by the Japanese. However, after a week, this panic has subsided. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who patrolled the road yesterday morning, except for the Japanese soldiers on guard at the gap on Chongming Road and the group inside the gap on Haining Road, the gap on Wenjianshi Road has not been set up since the retreat. The residents have obviously decreased after moving for several days, so there are not many people moving today. Many smaller shops are operating as usual, and residents entering and exiting the gaps are still free. Chinese police are still stationed outside the gaps. Overall, the situation is still quiet.

The Principal and Interest of the Reviving Gold Bonds Due Will Be Discounted and Paid by the Four Banks; The Unified Class A Bonds Will Be Drawn on the 10th; Principal and Interest Will Be Repaid by the End of January Next Year: After the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks agreed to discount and pay for the principal and interest of the domestic debt secured by customs duties, the principal and interest of the Seventh Unified Public Bonds began to be paid on July 31st. The principal and interest of the Seventh Reviving Public Bonds have been scheduled to begin to be paid on August 31st. The principal and interest of the Twelfth Financial Long-Term Public Bonds have also been scheduled to begin to be paid on September 30th. As for the eighth repayment of principal and interest on the Unified Public Bonds, it has been scheduled to begin to be paid on January 30th next year. As for the drawing of lots, Class A bonds have been scheduled to be drawn on the 10th of August in Shanghai. The National Debt Fund Management Committee has sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, and other organizations, requesting them to send personnel to the venue to supervise. It is heard that 25 lots will be drawn, with a principal repayment of 4.4 million yuan. The various types of bonds, B, C, D, and E, have also been scheduled to be drawn separately.

### Gunfire in Jiangwan: Machine Gun Fire and Rifle Fire Continued Intermittently for Half a Day

The Zi Lin Newspaper says that heavy machine gun fire was heard in the Jiangwan area from 3 to 4 pm yesterday (the 4th), and intermittent rifle fire was heard from that area again at nearly 11 pm. As of late last night, the details were unknown.

### Fractional Currency Will Be Issued Soon, Fully Backed by Legal Tender

The Central Bank, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, has signed a contract with the Hong Kong Wing Ning Printing Company to print 500,000 yuan of fractional currency notes to alleviate the shortage of copper auxiliary currency in the Shanghai market, including 300,000 yuan in one-fen notes and 200,000 yuan in five-fen notes. Once the printing is completed, the fractional currency notes will be issued, fully backed by legal tender. It is expected that the printing will be completed and delivered by mid-month, and the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank will be responsible for issuing and circulating them in the market. This is a temporary measure to alleviate the market situation. In the future, it is planned to issue aluminum coins.

### Although the Rice Market is Stalled, the Crackdown on Under-the-Table Deals Has Been Intensified: Arrivals Continue Uninterrupted, and Speculators Are Willing to Sell; Lack of Land Transport Vehicles Does Not Mean the Source Has Been Blocked

The rice market has been in turmoil in recent days due to the scarcity of sources and the rice merchants' hoarding and speculation, unwilling to display japonica rice for sale in the market, resulting in rampant under-the-table deals. However, in order to maintain the people's food supply, the concession authorities continue to enforce price limits, investigate warehouse stocks, and crack down on hoarding, and the rice merchants have to be wary. According to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the japonica rice still accounts for half of the various types of rice in storage that were announced by the Soybean and Rice Industry Association. At the same time, boats arriving from the river continue uninterrupted, with more than 10 boats arriving on the 4th and 7 or 8 boats arriving on the 5th. As for land transportation, the arrivals are not numerous due to the lack of vehicles, not because the source has been blocked.

The Authorities are Considering Dredging the Source

Chen Ziyi and Zhu Zixiang, members of the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, called on Vice-General Manager Ho De Kui of the Public Concession Bureau a few days ago. In addition to reporting on the Shanghai soybean and rice market situation, they requested (1) to find ways to dredge the source to allow rice from Wuhu and other places to be transported to Shanghai, and (2) to find ways to order and transport rice to Shanghai to relieve the situation, in order to maintain the food supply of Shanghai citizens. It is heard that the Public Concession Bureau has agreed to consider it, but it is determined to strictly enforce the price limits on food rice, and to allow reporting of rice shops that exceed the price limits at any time for investigation and handling.

Market Transactions are Tending to Stall

After the Fuzhou Road Qingyun Pavilion Soybean and Rice Market opened at 9:00 am yesterday, the transactions in the market were virtually stalled because the surveillance personnel stationed in the market strictly cracked down on under-the-table transactions, and each firm in the market had to sign, stipulating that white japonica rice should not exceed 20 yuan and guest indica rice should not exceed 16 yuan. If there is any violation, it will be handled. Therefore, the transactions in the market were virtually stalled, and under-the-table transactions were changed to direct negotiations outside the market. Therefore, only winter frost rice and other rice were traded in the market yesterday, and the number was very small.

### The Small Change Coupon of the Money Exchange Industry Has Been Properly Recovered: The Number is Limited; The Procedure is Simple

The money exchange and cigarette exchange industries, because the 500,000 yuan of auxiliary currency notes printed by the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank will soon be transported to Shanghai for issuance, the small change temporary coupon freely formulated by each firm when there was a shortage of copper fractional currency in the past should be recovered as soon as possible, so that the new coupon can arrive in Shanghai and unify the circulation in the market. According to a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency who inquired from the two industries yesterday, the temporary coupons issued by the member firms have been carefully recovered by the authorities of the two associations. Before the new coupon arrives in Shanghai, stamps can be used as much as possible to meet the urgent needs of the environment. It is heard that the number of temporary coupons distributed by the two industries is not large, and the recovery procedure is very simple.

### Prohibition of the Transport of Cube Sugar and Block Sugar

The Ministry of Finance ordered the various customs offices, saying that the previously determined list of foreign goods prohibited from being imported during extraordinary times has been ordered to be followed. It is now found that the cube sugar and block sugar listed in No. 299 of the import tariff should also be included in the list of prohibited goods.

### Japanese Warships Bombed Zhenhai Yesterday; Shanghai Ships Opened to Qiliyu; The Oujiang Estuary Has Been Blocked with Sand and Stones; The Opening of Aojiang Can Be Decided in the Short Term

The four ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line are currently in the Zhenhai Estuary. Yesterday, a certain shipping company in the city received a Ningbo military announcement stating that the Zhenhai Estuary was bombarded by Japanese warships the day before, with more than a dozen shells fired. Each ship opened to Qiliyu to avoid it, and the loading and unloading of passengers and goods was delayed. The Moufu and Baoli ships, which were originally scheduled to return to Shanghai today, will have to be postponed until Monday (the 7th) of next week due to the above-mentioned impact.

Japanese Warships Bombarded

Japanese warships frequently come and go outside the Zhenhai Estuary. According to sources in the shipping industry, there is currently a Japanese warship anchored on the sea surface of Qiliyu, with no unusual movements yet. Two Japanese warships arrived on the sea surface of Ligang at 2 pm on the afternoon of the 3rd, put down speedboats and patrolled, and then opened to Xie Pei and fired more than a dozen shells on the shore without any reported losses. Three Japanese warships were anchored on the sea surface of Chuanshan, and fired seven or eight shells on the shore on the morning of the 4th.

The Oujiang River is Blocked

The Japanese have blockaded the Wenzhou shipping route. First, they used warships to patrol and prohibit any shipping from entering the Oujiang River. Currently, fishing boats have been used to carry sand and stones and sink them outside the Oujiang Estuary, effectively blocking the shipping. Therefore, the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou is factually impossible. The Shenguang ship did not complete this last voyage, and the round trip took a week. Fortunately, it did not load passengers or goods, and the loss was minimal.

Opening Aojiang

After the obstruction of the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou, the shipping industry has submitted a request to the authorities to open Aojiang in order to divert passenger and freight transport between Shanghai and Wenzhou. According to sources in the shipping industry, the authorities have agreed to consider it, and it is hoped that it can be realized in the short term. Various foreign shipping companies are processing registration procedures. Once approved, they can resume shipping. At that time, passenger and freight transport from various ports in Wenzhou can be rerouted.

### Supervisory Committee Member Mao Mianlu Passed Away; Public Memorial Service Will Be Held Today

Mao Mianlu, a member of the Supervisory Yuan and a native of Ningbo, passed away in his native Fenghua last month. The central government has telegraphed condolences. Now, more than 30 of Mao's disciples in Shanghai, such as Cao Jingyuan, have scheduled a public memorial service at the Ningbo Shanghai Native Association on Yu Qiaqing Road at 9 am today to express their condolences.

### Zhaofeng Park Brass Band Concert

The Public Concession Bureau Music Band will hold a brass band concert in Zhaofeng Park from 5:30 pm to 7:00 pm on the 6th (weather permitting). There will be seven items on the program.

### Mr. Pan Tanghua Talks About the Brisk Sales of National Products in the Nanyang Islands: Nearly One Million Overseas Chinese are Happy to Purchase and Use Them; Monthly Donations from Salaries and Wages Support the War of Resistance

Mr. Pan Tanghua, manager of the Zhava Company in this city, has always been enthusiastic about promoting national products. He has made outstanding contributions to the success of national products being sold overseas. Mr. Pan left Shanghai on March 21st of this year to go abroad and inspect the sales situation of national products in the Nanyang Islands. Now that the inspection is completed, he arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the French postal ship President Doumer yesterday morning. Many national product manufacturers in the city went to the New Customs Wharf to welcome him. Mr. Chang Pan Zhihui, entrusted by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Medan, and Mr. Li Qiaoguang, a business tycoon in Singapore, also came to Shanghai with Mr. Pan to inspect the domestic national product business. The reporter visited Mr. Pan yesterday and was told about the experience of this trip and the current situation of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang, which is recorded as follows:

Footprints Extend Throughout Nanyang

Mr. Pan first said that before the War of Resistance, China's national product business was developing daily, and domestic sales were also very prosperous. Places such as Yunnan, Hankou, Chongqing, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong usually purchased national products from Shanghai and Hong Kong. After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, all the coastal ports were blocked by the Japanese, and inland transportation was blocked, so the national product industry suffered a major blow. I deeply feel that the motherland's industry and commerce during the War of Resistance need to open up new paths in order to cultivate wartime production. This trip passed through Surabaya, Sampo, Long, Cirebon, Batavia (Jakarta) of the West Celebes Island of the Meng Java Islands, and Medan of Sumatra, and then went to Singapore and transferred to Hong Kong before returning to Shanghai.

National Products Sell Well in Markets Everywhere

The above-mentioned places were originally large markets for Japanese goods before the war. Since the War of Resistance, many Japanese workers have been engaged in the production of heavy industry, which has increased the cost of Japanese goods, compared to five to one before the war. National products have been able to sell well. Currently, 60% of the products in the Nanyang Islands are domestic products. Cotton products such as shirts and cotton shirts are all produced in Hong Kong. Sundries such as felt hats, blankets, thermos bottles, light bulbs, toothbrushes, socks, towels, handkerchiefs, undershirts, and balls are purchased from Shanghai. Among them, cotton textiles and towels and socks are the best-selling. However, the quality of cotton textiles in Hong Kong is better than that in Shanghai. It is hoped that manufacturers in this city will make improvements in this regard. There are branches of the Bank of China in Singapore and Medan, which makes it very convenient to remit money to purchase goods. Although the foreign exchange rate is changing, it has no impact on the sales of national products. Currently, 100 yuan of legal tender is approximately equal to 15 Dutch guilders.

Overseas Chinese Love Their Country and Boycott Japanese Goods

The overseas Chinese's enthusiasm for caring about the victory of the motherland's War of Resistance is very moving. They are especially dedicated to the boycott of Japanese goods. Those who usually use Japanese goods now use national products. If overseas Chinese abandon national products and still use Japanese goods, they will first be warned and fined to donate to the national salvation fund. There are more than 2,000 "secret investigators" in Singapore who are specifically responsible for observing whether overseas Chinese are purchasing Japanese goods.

Huge Sums of Money Are Remitted to Support the Country

Of the various ports, Singapore, Medan, Batavia, and Makassar are the most prosperous. Singapore has 600,000 overseas Chinese, and Medan has more than 30,000. The Singapore authorities are still free to overseas Chinese. The Dutch are stricter, and the local economic department has restrictions on the import of national products. However, under certain circumstances, special accommodation can be requested. The British and Dutch governments are also very sympathetic to China's War of Resistance, and there have been no incidents of excessive suppression of patriotic actions by overseas Chinese. In Singapore, overseas Chinese have donated 20 million yuan, but the funds are raised in the name of the "Disaster Relief Association" locally. A portion of the monthly salary and wages of overseas Chinese is also deducted for donations. Mr. Pan and Mr. Li still need to stay in Shanghai for a period of time to inspect and plan the national product sales business.

### Cao Yi Elementary School Incident in West Shanghai: Japanese and Italian Authorities Reach Understanding; Japanese Troops Post Notices at School Gate; Japanese Prevent Activities Outside School

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, Japanese and Italian troops have taken control of Cao Yi Elementary School at 1081 Jessfield Road to prevent further disputes. Yesterday (the 4th), Japanese and Italian troops posted notices on the school gate, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. Reliable sources say this action was taken because another dispute arose at noon yesterday. The incident stemmed from Thursday morning when

Italian Troops Arrested

armed terrorists. At 2:00 PM on the same day, a Mr. Xu, believed to be the "Chief of Staff of the Special Service Corps," believing the dispute had ended and that the building could be used as an office for the "Special Service Corps," arrived at Cao Yi Elementary School with several others and their families in a truck carrying bedding, intending to

Occupy the Premises

At noon yesterday, Mr. Xu appeared outside the building with a weapon in hand, accompanied by another armed individual. They were immediately arrested by Italian troops. Since Thursday afternoon, the women who had moved into the building have not been seen leaving. The Japanese notice prohibits "entry" and exit, indicating that these individuals are still inside the building. Although no official announcement has been made, it seems that the Japanese and Italian authorities have

Reached an Understanding

stipulating that all activities take place inside the school gate (reportedly, inside the school gate is outside the boundary of the International Settlement). Italian troops are not to interfere, while the Japanese have ordered the "Special Service Corps" not to carry weapons such as broadswords, hand grenades, and Mauser pistols outside the gate.

The Continental Times reports that

the sixteen Chinese suspected terrorists arrested by Italian marines on Jessfield Road on Thursday morning were still detained at 62 Rue Robert, the Italian naval headquarters, last night (the 4th). This news, obtained from high-ranking authorities around 10:00 PM last night, contradicts earlier reports on Thursday that the Italian troops had handed over these individuals, believed to be members of the "Great Way" [Da Dao], to the Japanese and Italian military. Regarding this case, recent reports indicate that although the Japanese have

Negotiated for the Release

of these individuals with the Italian authorities, the Italian authorities have not yet agreed. Although well-informed sources believed last night that these individuals might be released or handed over to the Japanese, the Italian naval authorities in Shanghai are no longer responsible for this matter. It is now understood that the case has been transferred to the Italian Embassy for handling, making it a political rather than a military matter. Last night, some even suggested that the Italian government would be consulted before

Handing Over to the Japanese

these individuals and all their weapons. These individuals were arrested by Italian troops at 1081 Jessfield Road on Thursday morning and taken to the Italian military headquarters. The Japanese and Italian military and the "Great Way Government" have requested the release of these individuals. The Italian naval authorities have reported the matter to the Italian Embassy. According to the North-China Daily News,

Italian Marines

are guarding the premises at 1081 Jessfield Road, Jessfield Road, prohibiting anyone from approaching. Rumors that ten of the individuals immediately returned to the building after being released by the Italian troops have been denied. It is firmly stated that the premises will be guarded indefinitely by Italian marines. Commander Villalta of the Italian military headquarters, when questioned by reporters at noon yesterday, considered that this "slightly shocking event" that occurred on Thursday has now passed.

### Arrival of Passenger Liners in Shanghai: Canadian Empress, Russian Empress, and Luxury Liner Victoria

The Canadian Pacific's Empress of Canada, which departed Shanghai for Hong Kong and Manila on the 25th of last month, is now on its return voyage and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today (the 6th) at 4:00 PM, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. A tender will depart from the Customs Wharf today at 4:00 PM and return passengers to the Customs Wharf for landing around 5:30 PM. The main liner is scheduled to weigh anchor at 11:30 AM tomorrow (the 7th), heading to Japan and then returning to Canada via Honolulu. The final tender will depart from the Customs Wharf at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning. Additionally, the company's Russian Empress, which has sailed from Canada to the Far East, is expected to pass Nagasaki and arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 7th) around 4:00 PM, also docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will disembark around 5:30 PM via a tender to the Customs Wharf. The main liner is scheduled to weigh anchor at 11:00 AM on the 8th, heading to Hong Kong and Manila. The final tender will depart from the Customs Wharf at 9:30 AM on the 8th. The Italian Line's Eurasia Line passenger liner Victoria, which departed from Genoa on the 13th of last month, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 7th) around 4:00 PM, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. According to the company, it was expected to pass Hong Kong yesterday, but no report has been received from the liner. Therefore, whether it will arrive in Shanghai on time depends on the liner's telegram today for accurate information.

### Sand and Gravel Shipments to Shanghai Blocked; Contracts Cannot Be Fulfilled; Shanghai Construction Industry's Orders and Contracts; Sand and Gravel Industry Declares Temporary Inability to Deliver

According to Xin Sheng She [New Voice Society], sand and gravel in the Shanghai concessions, which were previously shipped from Sansi Reef and other places, are now being impounded due to the Japanese implementation of control, leading to a depletion of sand and gravel in the concessions and affecting the local construction industry. The Shanghai Sand and Gravel Trade Association issued an urgent statement yesterday stating, "Due to the illegal and forcible impoundment of all sand and gravel shipments to Shanghai, the concessions are now devoid of sand and gravel. Our association's members are unable to fulfill contracts or orders with the construction industry. In addition to requesting assistance from the authorities, as this is an extraordinary event, it is beyond our capabilities. We hereby issue this solemn statement, hoping that the construction industry will grant understanding. We respectfully seek your understanding."

### Overview of the Fire in Datuan Town

During the recent large-scale offensive launched by guerrillas in the southern part of Pudong, Datuan Town was once captured. As the two sides engaged in close combat, fires broke out in various parts of the town. Over two consecutive nights, Datuan Town suffered unprecedented devastation. According to villagers who came to Shanghai, starting from the residence of Zhai A-san in the Lower Pond area and extending north to the residence of Shao Xin-guan, a total of forty to fifty houses were destroyed. Starting from Zhai Song-sheng's mat shop on New Street and extending south, hundreds of commercial buildings, including smoke shops, paper shops, oil and liquor stores, general merchandise stores, fish markets, and small and large shops, were destroyed. The Zhou surname's sugar mill and residence across from the Yangxin Temple were destroyed, and over ten thatched houses in the Taoist temple were burned. Many civilians perished in the chaos.

### Pawnshops in Western Shanghai Oppose Counterfeit Taxes; Taxation Based on Pawned Capital; Tax Rates Excessively High

The twenty-nine pawnshops on the Yuejie Quyao Road [Outside the Border Road] area in western Shanghai are now facing the "Finance Bureau" levying a so-called "business tax." Personnel have been dispatched to each pawnshop to record the pawned capital, with tax rates ranging from one to three per thousand of the pawned capital. The pawnshop industry in the area considers the tax rates excessively high, making them unbearable and difficult to find relief. Moreover, during the Shanghai Municipal Government era, the business tax paid by this industry was calculated based on the amount of capital, but it is now calculated based on the amount of pawned capital, which is a significant difference. Therefore, they strongly oppose it. Furthermore, each pawnshop has obtained a license from the Municipal Council.

### Autumn Flood Season Approaching; High Tides Cause for Concern; Huangpu River Not Dredged, Riverbed Rising Daily; Water Level Increasing Sharply

Starting from the eighth of this month, the Huangpu River will enter the autumn flood season. Every year at this time, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River experience snowmelt, causing the river water to rise. The mouth of the Wusong River is the tail end, so if the water level outside the mouth is high, the Huangpu River will also be affected. At the same time, during this period, due to the close proximity of the moon to the earth, the tides are pulled higher, so there are usually high tides. Especially this year, the Huangpu River has not been dredged, and the number of hurricanes is also higher than in previous years. If these two factors coincide with the high tide season, then the flooding situation in Shanghai is extremely worrying. Even without hurricanes, the height of the Huangpu Riverbed is unprecedented since the establishment of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau. Therefore, a sharp increase in the water level is expected. If the weather is bad, high tides are easily triggered. At a minimum, water will accumulate on the roads, and it will take a long time to recede. The autumn flood high tide period will greatly inconvenience travel.

### Town Chief of Fahua Town Abducted

The current town chief of Fahua Town, Ma Hengbin (also known as Shao Liang, a native of Zhenjiang), previously sought temporary refuge in Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai due to difficult handling of affairs. However, on the morning of the day before yesterday, Ma was suddenly abducted by more than ten armed men while in town. Afterwards, the family received a letter demanding a large sum of money for his release. After some negotiation, a compromise could not be reached due to the difference in the amount.

### Boy Scout Lu Shihua Sacrifices His Life in the Line of Duty; Family Urgently Awaits Assistance and Compensation

Lu Shihua, a Boy Scout from Shanghai, was killed in action when Nanchang fell. A representative from the Shanghai Boy Scout Council visited his home to investigate and console his father, Lu Jincai, who is in his sixties and supports himself through peddling. His only son, Shihua, was originally a trainee at a bank. Inspired by patriotism during the war of resistance, he secretly left home and joined the Shanghai Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps. After withdrawing westward with the army, he experienced the hardships of the battles of the capital and Xuzhou. Unfortunately, he died a heroic death in the Battle of Nanchang. His elderly father is still unaware that his beloved son has sacrificed his life for the country. Many kind-hearted people in Shanghai are able to introduce his elderly father to positions such as gardener or gatekeeper to spend his remaining years in peace. This would be a great act of merit. His address in Shanghai can be obtained from the Shanghai Xu Garden Refugee Middle School on Kang Nao Tuo Road [Connaught Road].

### Zhejiang Province's Tea Purchases Changed to China Tea Company; Over 10,000 Dan Collected in War Zones; Strict Prevention of Smuggling

The purchase of tea in Zhejiang Province, originally entrusted by the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance to the Provincial Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office, has now been changed to the China Tea Company starting in the second half of the year. Therefore, the tea department of the Management Office has been reorganized. From now on, the business part of the tea department will be the responsibility of the China Tea Company. The Zhejiang Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office purchased approximately 10,000 dan of tea in various counties in the war zone this year. Approximately 4,000 dan have already been transported to the rear. This number did not reach the original target. Inconvenient transportation in the war zone and a reduction in coolies were important reasons for the difficulty in purchasing. Smuggling is also unavoidable. Currently, the authorities in this area have taken note and are preventing it to maintain resources.

### Ministry of Railways Seeks to Aid Railway Employees Who Lost Jobs

Since the National Army withdrew from Shanghai, the Jinghu [Nanjing-Shanghai], Huhangyong [Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo], Pinghan [Beijing-Hankou], and Jinpu [Tianjin-Pukou] Railways have successively fallen, causing most of the railway employees to lose their jobs. The various railway unions had petitioned the Ministry of Railways for relief to maintain their livelihoods. Recently, the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate the situation of the employees in detail. The authorities have formulated relief measures for the unemployed employees and will provide placement or maintain their livelihoods. The investigation has now been completed and has moved to the Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou areas to conduct similar investigations.

### China International Famine Relief Commission; Relief News from Anhui Province; Allocation of 20,000 Yuan for Emergency Relief; Still Seeking Donations from All Sectors

The China International Famine Relief Commission at 97 Renji Road, Shanghai, has recently received many letters from various parts of northern Anhui requesting the allocation of funds for relief, stating that after the war, it was followed by a year of famine. The people are suffering from famine, and the number of people starving to death is increasing daily. According to the two reports from the World Red Swastika Society in April and May of this year, the number of famine-stricken areas in northern Anhui that urgently need relief has increased to twenty-seven districts. The China International Famine Relief Commission has specially tried to investigate the famine situation in each of these areas and how to provide relief and post-disaster rehabilitation methods. The commission has now allocated 20,000 yuan to entrust the implementation of emergency relief in some of the most severely affected areas. However, the funds are small, and the disaster is huge, so the effectiveness is very limited. It is still seeking donations from all benevolent people to provide assistance.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Work for July

Last month, the Child Protection Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council handled a total of 73 cases, including 54 new cases, classified as follows: (1) Vagrancy, abandonment, and lost children: 12 cases; (2) Abduction: 5 cases; (3) Prostitution, child prostitution, and rape: 9 cases; (4) Beggars and thieves arrested: 17 cases; (5) Assault or abuse: 4 cases; (6) Maids: 4 cases; (7) Other: 3 cases. Classified by gender, there were 17 boys, 35 girls, and 2 young married women. Classified by age, there were 3 over 20 years old, 12 over 15 years old, 21 over 10 years old, 12 over 5 years old, and 6 under 5 years old. 33 of these children were handed over to foster care organizations, 11 were returned to their relatives, and the disposition of 9 was undecided. 13 children who were begging on the streets or guarding cars were arrested by the police. These children do not have normal families, and most of them live in the alleyways at night. The Child Protection Association has taken steps to provide relief to these child beggars and plans to establish a school to accommodate them. A foreman who employed laborers was found to have abused child labor, and with conclusive evidence, the police filed a lawsuit, and the court sentenced him to three months of imprisonment. Last month, a total of 249 child offenders violated criminal law and penal law, including 181 boys and 68 girls and young women. In addition, there were 74 child offenders who violated the regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council, all of whom were tried and sentenced by the Shanghai First Special District Court.

### Notice for Mailing Letters: Addresses Must Be Detailed and Clear; One Stamp Should Be Affixed

Since the National Army moved westward and order was restored in Shanghai, refugees from the suburbs and other places have flocked to Shanghai, causing the population of Shanghai to surge. In addition to the doubling of sales of daily necessities, the correspondence with other places has increased by about half. However, most residents, due to coming from remote rural areas, often do not specify the addresses for delivery of ordinary mail, express mail, and registered mail, causing the post office to be unable to deliver, delaying time, or inevitably causing loss. Moreover, traffic is blocked in various places, and postal transportation is difficult. Or even if the name and address of the recipient are clearly written, the address of the sender is only written as a certain box. Once the recipient has moved, it is impossible to return the letter. However, those who do not understand the situation often blame the post office for the poor delivery of mail. Yesterday, I learned from the Shanghai Postal Administration that for all kinds of letters delivered in the future, both the sender and the recipient must provide detailed names and addresses to avoid delay and loss. If they still fail to specify clearly, they will be refused acceptance. Moreover, Article 16 of the Postal Regulations stipulates that domestic mail should specify the province, city, county, township, town, street, lane, house number, and name. Also, regarding scattered stamps, due to the current shortage of copper coins, citizens use stamps as a substitute, so scattered stamps such as one-cent, two-cent, and five-cent stamps are circulating in the market in large numbers. However, the general public often affixes five one-cent stamps to a letter for ordinary mail. The post office has refused to accept this type of mail and stipulates that ordinary mail must have one five-cent stamp, registered mail must have one thirteen-cent stamp, and express mail must have one seventeen-cent stamp.

### Two Bullets Enclosed in Letter; Extortion of Candy Company; Seven Released Without Charge; Six Indicted According to Law

The Xumeifeng Candy Company branch at 35 Baoyu Lane, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, received a threatening letter on June 30, enclosing two bullets and demanding 5,000 yuan, stating, "We will use extreme measures to deal with you if you negotiate payment at the Guanle Tea House on Avenue Joffre on the afternoon of July 1," etc. The store owner reported the information to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Wang Zhen, Chen Zhengshi, Chen A-jian, Chen Jinyu, Chen Lidao, Huang Ruocun, Li Zhiye, Shen Liansun, Xu Jiabin, Ma Yukun, Zhuang Zhenzhai, Chen Jianlong, Lin Lemei and other male and female suspects, thirteen in total, at the Guanle Tea House and 14 Yongqing Lane, Dongxinqiao Street, and other places. They also seized seals and certain documents at the Leidian Printing House, 11 Huage Nie Road [Route Wagner], and sent them to the Second Special Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The investigation of this case has now been completed by the French Police Department. Yesterday morning, Chief Judge Liao of the Second Special Court presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated that seven suspects, Ma Yukun, Chen Jianlong, Chen Zhengshi, Chen Lidao, Chen Liansun, Zhuang Zhenzhai, and Lin Lemei, were found to be unrelated to the case and would not be prosecuted. Wang Zhen, Chen Jinyu, Huang Ruocun, Xu Jiabin, Chen A-ji, and Li Zhiye were indicted for extortion and possession of military weapons and requested to be tried according to law. After the investigating detectives reported the details of the investigation, the court verified the report and ordered the unprosecuted defendants to be taken down. After questioning Wang Zhen and the other six one by one in detail, the hearing was adjourned to the 19th for further questioning. The defendants were returned to custody, and the seven unprosecuted defendants, including Ma Yukun, were to be released.

### Opium Discovered in Home of Cotton Yarn Merchant; Admits to Smoking, Denies Trafficking; Claims to Be Victim of Revenge

Xu Jingzhi, a cotton yarn merchant from Suzhou, and his wife, Madame Wang, resided together at 12, Lane 289, Weihaiwei Road. Recently, Hua Detective Ye Yuxi, Detective Liu Zhaonian, and Li Shugui from the Anti-Narcotics Department of the General Inspectorate found that the Xu couple was privately selling opium. On the 2nd of this month, they first sent detectives to purchase half an ounce of opium from Xu Wangshi for seven yuan in legal tender, and then requested the First Special Court to issue a search warrant. At 9:00 AM on the 4th, they went to arrest Xu Jingzhi and his wife, Xu Wangshi, and seized four jars of opium, weighing seventeen ounces, a small amount of opium residue, fourteen seals, and a scale. They also found two pieces of Persian opium, weighing eighteen ounces, in a locked cabinet and took them to the police station separately for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, filed charges according to Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Opium Crimes, accusing them of selling opium, and stated the details of the case, saying that, according to the defendant Xu Jingzhi's confession at the police station, the opium was bought from Zheng Qiaji's opium shop, and a Hu surname was hired as a partner. Because the opium raw materials were not good, Persian opium was added, etc. When Xu Jingzhi was questioned, he

admitted to smoking but denied selling, and Xu Wangshi also confessed that her husband had a habit in the past but absolutely did not sell opium, and hired lawyers Xi Shichang and others to defend, stating that the case was actually due to a grudge and revenge. Xu Jingzhi had previously been involved in a lawsuit with Chen, the owner of Ding Taihe Yarn Shop, in your court's civil court. Chen lost the first instance, and the appeal was dismissed on July 30, causing

resentment. Chen once expressed that although the civil case had failed, he would get revenge one day because Xu smoked opium. Unexpectedly, two or three days later, this case occurred. The presiding judge concluded the debate on the case and scheduled the verdict for the 11th. The two defendants were returned to custody.

### Impersonating Detectives; Extortion; Discovered and Arrested

Rogues Yao Genlin (40 years old, Suzhou native, resident of 35 Shouan Lane, Baxianqiao), Lin Kunjin (41 years old, Changshu native, no address), Yao Wenbin (33 years old, no address), and Ding Shaotong (34 years old, resident of 2 Mingde Lane, Mofang Street) colluded to go to the home of Mrs. Chen Pushi, 51 Shangxian Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, at around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday. They claimed to have a private collection of opium and said that they were ordered by the police to search. If they were given a reward of 500 yuan, they could avoid trouble, otherwise, they would be arrested, etc. Chen Pushi's younger brother, Peichunlin, saw through Yao's deception and knew that they were impersonating detectives and extorting money. So, he pretended to comply and sent someone out to call the French police. The detectives, Kang Hui, and others, rushed to the scene and arrested Yao and the other three. They were taken back to the police station and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday morning. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated the details of the case and requested an adjournment for investigation, then requested a trial. After Judge Liao questioned the defendants, their statements were ambiguous. The court ordered the defendants to be detained and the hearing rescheduled for the 19th.

### Brother Killed by Gunfire; Elder Brother Seeks Justice; Zhou Huaiqing Highly Suspected; Arrested After Reporting to the Police; Simultaneously Detained

Wang Qirong, 22 years old, from Liuhe, had been selling cigarettes and miscellaneous goods from Shanghai to Liu since the war. On June 13 of this year, he was suddenly shot and killed at Zhao Wang Temple, two miles from Liuhe. Liu Dexiang and Xu Liuming were also killed at the same time. Wang's adopted brother, Guo Wenhua, went to collect the body after the incident but could not find out who killed his brother. Until recently, a person named Meng told Guo Wenhua that Zhou Huaiqing from Liuhe killed his brother. Guo strictly investigated Zhou's whereabouts, plotting to avenge his brother. Until 2:40 PM on the 4th, Guo passed Sichuan Road, Hankou Road, and suddenly encountered Zhou. So, he called Hua Detective Wu Yaozu and the 67th Hua policeman to arrest Zhou and take him to the General Patrol Room. After investigation, the detectives believed that although Guo firmly pointed out that Zhou was the murderer who killed his brother, he could not provide conclusive evidence. To avoid false accusations, Guo and Zhou were detained together and sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Jiang Baolian, the police lawyer, requested permission to temporarily detain both Guo and Zhou so that the detectives could investigate in detail. If they obtained conclusive evidence that Zhou had killed someone, they would request Guo's release, etc. After Judge Feng Shide questioned them, he ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for one week.

### Entrusted Friend Falsely Claims to Have Been Killed by Japanese Troops; Attempting to Embezzle Funds; Busted by Original Owner While Still Trying to Cover Up; Continued Delay in Returning Funds Leads to Detention

Chen Xianhe, 57 years old, from Hangzhou, currently residing at 18 Pope Lane, Luban Road, French Concession, was previously the manager of the Hengda Xie Paint Shop in Hangzhou. He came to Shanghai to take refuge due to the war and is temporarily residing at the above location, still engaged in his old business. Wanting to develop his business, he wrote to his brother, Chen Shengqing, last month, asking him to send funds to Shanghai to purchase goods. On June 30, his brother Chen Shengqing entrusted his fellow villager and friend Meng Jinshui (45 years old) to

carry 1,400 yuan in cash to Shanghai to be handed over to Chen Xianhe. Unexpectedly, after Meng arrived in Shanghai, he had bad intentions and temporarily resided at the home of his friend Ge Ruhua, 30 Shangren Lane, McTaggart Road. He then asked Ge to call Chen Xianhe, falsely claiming that Meng had been killed by Japanese troops on the way and that the funds he was carrying had been robbed. At that time, Chen did not believe him because his words were contradictory. He immediately went to Ge Ruhua's place with his friend Zhu Ziliang to

inquire about the news and ran into Meng sleeping on Ge's bed. Seeing Chen and others, Meng's face turned pale, and he could not answer. Then he claimed that although he had not been killed by the Japanese troops, he had been severely beaten and was willing to compensate the full amount. At that time, he returned 600 yuan, and he also obtained 200 yuan from Meng's younger sister, Tao Mengshi, making a total of 800 yuan, still short 600 yuan. He promised to return it on time, but

continued to delay. Chen then reported to the French police, accusing Meng and his sister of embezzlement and requesting an investigation. The detectives arrested Meng Jinshui and Tao Mengshi, and yesterday they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. They were charged with embezzlement and possession of property belonging to others and requested a rescheduling of the hearing because the investigation had not been completed. After Judge Li questioned the defendants, he ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for the 9th. The defendants were detained.

### Armed Brawl on Zhoushan Road

### Car Driver Leads Mob Violence, Two Seriously Injured

Yesterday (the 5th) at 4:45 PM, an incident of fighting and injury occurred at the entrance of Yuanshang Lane on the south side of East Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, French Avenue. The details are as follows:

The incident originated at No. 1 Yuanshang Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, a three-story Western-style building. The second landlord is an elderly woman surnamed [ ] (commonly known as Grandma). She rented the third floor to Zhang Xiaomao and his wife, a car driver working for Hu, the head of the French Municipal Council, who resided in the former lane of the Hu residence. The second floor was rented to He Jingqing and his family, an accountant at the Lao Zhenghe restaurant on Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession. The first floor was rented to someone surnamed Jia, who opened a clothing store. The second landlord lived on the mezzanine. Zhang Xiaomao wanted to take over the second floor. He Jingqing refused to move, and Zhang harbored resentment. At the end of last month, He fell ill and was bedridden. Zhang Xiaomao made loud noises when going up and down the stairs. He's wife politely asked Zhang to be quieter when using the stairs. Zhang claimed that He's wife was intentionally interfering with his movements, leading to arguments and mutual scolding. The two sides became incompatible. A few days ago, they fought each other at home and went to the McBain Police Station to report the injury. The case is still unresolved.

Yesterday (the 5th) at 4:45 PM, Zhang Xiaomao gathered more than ten fellow car drivers (including four or five women), each carrying wooden sticks and knives. They rushed into He Jingqing's room on the second floor of No. 1 Yuanshang Lane, destroying the belongings. At that time, He was talking with his colleagues Li Binghan and Xie Dejun (both waiters at Lao Zhenghe restaurant). Seeing Zhang leading a crowd to assault people and destroy property, they joined the fray. The two sides fought from inside the house to the middle of the road. As a result, Li Binghan was the most seriously injured. The corners of his forehead and temples were stabbed with a knife, blood flowing profusely, his head swollen and bruised, and his body covered with wounds. He collapsed at the entrance of the lane. Xie Dejun and He Jingqing were both beaten internally with sticks and fled into the Xinxin pawnshop opposite Renmei Lane, unable to move.

The main perpetrator is at large. At that time, nearby patrol officers heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. Zhang Xiaomao and his accomplices, seeing their purpose achieved, scattered and fled. When the police arrived, the perpetrators had already escaped. They only saw the injured lying on the sidewalk, barely breathing, with blood everywhere. They immediately called the police station and dispatched an ambulance to take the injured Li Binghan, Xie Dejun, and He Jingqing to the Renji Hospital for treatment. Detectives took the second landlord, the elderly woman [ ], to the police station for investigation. According to one account, the suspects have already been arrested.

### "Shanghai Livestock Market" Employee Stabbed

Yu Guihe, a Ningbo native and employee of the "Shanghai Livestock Market" at No. 52 Yuezhou Road in Pudong, 19 years old, was involved in a verbal dispute with several pork butcher workers at around 3:30 PM yesterday. The dispute escalated into a physical altercation. Yu stepped forward to mediate but was stabbed in the left foot with a sharp knife by one of the workers. Blood flowed profusely. The perpetrator was arrested by the post police and taken to the police station. The injured person was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Crackdown on Lottery Ticker in Zhejiang Road

Hired by lottery kingpins Mao Axiang and Li Xiaobao, a lottery ticker was set up at No. 48, Lane 229, Zhejiang Road, exclusively collecting gambling funds from various brothels in Yunnan Road, Guangxi Road, Shantou Road, and other locations. On average, it could collect 700-800 yuan in national currency per day. Previously, detective Chen Ruisheng from the police station discovered this and arrested the accomplices, A Bang and Jiang Zhaoying, at the address. 48 yuan in gambling money, 17 lottery tickets, one abacus, one ledger, and several pencils were confiscated. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, where Judge Zhong questioned them and rendered a judgment. Gu A Bang and Jiang Zhaoying were sentenced to eleven months of imprisonment for intending to profit by inducing others to gamble. The gambling paraphernalia and money were confiscated.

### Fire in Avenue Joffre

A firewood shop at No. 1, Lane 214 (Shunchang Lane), west of Limei Road on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, caught fire accidentally at 4:20 PM yesterday. The flames soared, bursting through the roof. The Central Fire Brigade received the news and rushed to the scene. However, because firewood and coal are highly flammable, the fire was not extinguished until around 6:00 PM. It also spread to neighboring houses. The French Route 21 and Route 22 buses had to temporarily change their routes to Avenue Haig due to the traffic disruption caused by the fire.

### Young Man Commits Suicide Due to Gambling

Tang Shiqing, 26 years old, from Songjiang, lived in the Xujiahui Zhengtangjie area. He worked as a servant for a Western family on Avenue Haig. Recently, Tang frequented gambling dens, resulting in heavy debts that he could not repay. He conceived the idea of ending his life. The night before, he secretly bought and consumed opium. Until yesterday morning, he groaned from poisoning. His family rushed him to the hospital for treatment but it was too late. He died shortly after arriving at the hospital.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor:

I read in your newspaper's local news column on the 4th of this month an article about the tenants of Haigeri opposing rent increases, which is not in accordance with the facts. The rent for the houses in Haigeri, Xujiahui owned by our church are extremely low. The land tax and repair costs have increased greatly, so we have made a minimum increase of four yuan for the tenants. The tenants of this church are very understanding and most have agreed to the increase. The claim of unanimous opposition and demand for retraction is not true. We are afraid that the rumors are false, so we specially request your newspaper to correct the record for public convenience. Sincerely, Haigeri Madun Hou Church Rental Office.

To the Editor:

According to Mr. Wei Kuisheng, the party concerned, I read a news item in the newspaper on the 4th of this month entitled "Rampant Jianghu Swindlers", in which several points differ slightly from the facts. It was discovered that after being swindled on July 10, I reported the matter to the police on two occasions. The first decision was to report the facts, but the police dismissed it as unfounded. Later, because I was unable, I reported the theft to the police for the second time. The previous case had already been recorded. Furthermore, I have resigned from the store and not been dismissed, because I felt that my experience was not enough after this incident and I planned to give up business and go to school for further studies. Furthermore, the police reported the theft because the fraud was not accepted. Fortunately, the fraudsters have been arrested, and I can now express my inner feelings. This matter concerns my personal reputation, and I hereby entrust your lawyer to write to the newspapers to request a correction. I hereby urgently inform you that I hope that you will grant the correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Xu Wufang, August 5.

To the Editor:

Having reviewed your newspaper news of the 5th of this month, there is a report of a Jiang, who apparently suffers from a chronic disease, and who wishes to act unfavorably toward a Shi, a teacher at Zhengzhong Middle School. He was subsequently escorted to the police station by the police. None of our new and old teaching staff are surnamed Shi, and we are deeply concerned that the outside world will spread false information. We hereby specially request you to correct this for the sake of propriety. Sincerely, Shanghai Private Zhengzhong Middle School, August 5.

### Don't Be Allowed to Eat Idle Rice

— Fenfei

Children! I hope you don't eat "idle rice," and we shouldn't be allowed to "eat idle rice."

In today's severe national crisis, every one of our Chinese compatriots is absolutely not allowed to "eat idle rice." Life must be "productive." Look! The children of Jiangbei, during the scorching heat of summer, leave deep imprints of their lives on every street inside and outside the city. Especially near the garbage cans at the corners of the roads, there are always groups of Jiangbei children with baskets on their backs or in their hands, their eyes always searching inside, as if there are pearls and treasures there. But I don't find it strange, because there are many waste items in the garbage cans, which become useful after they take them away. Otherwise, wouldn't they become fools? Because of the pressure of life, everyone, old and young, has work to do. Like the old women! They run out to mend clothes and quilts for others. The adults carry sugar loads to sell sugar on the streets. The old men mostly live on boats doing odd jobs. The children, from three or four years old to seventeen or eighteen, come out to "pick scraps." So it can be said that no one is "eating idle rice," and they are not allowed to "eat idle rice."

The hardworking spirit of the people of Jiangbei is something we have seen countless times. It is worthy of our admiration. Whether in summer or winter, they mostly go barefoot. Especially in the hot summer, the younger children are completely naked, truly the founders and practitioners of the nude movement. When we look at their faces, we might think they are sick, but their skin is reddish-black and strong. Although they are in a situation that easily "causes illness," bacteria still don't invade, and their resistance is very strong. The yellowness of their faces is clearly due to insufficient nutrition, and the reddish-black is clearly the result of being scorched by the sun. They are not afraid of wind, frost, rain, or dew. I often see children (boys and girls) around four or five years old always walking barefoot on the ground. At the same time, the older children lead them to "pick scraps" everywhere. Before meals in the evening, we will see them carrying extremely heavy baskets, tied with ropes around their necks. But they don't seem to be in pain, on the contrary, they are very happy to return home (to the boat) to eat. The things they eat every day (vegetable scraps and roots thrown away in the garbage cans) or leftover food begged from others. They are not particular about the vegetables, but they eat their fill of rice. "Picking scraps" is the only job of Jiangbei children.

Everyone, you probably won't say I'm lying about the above facts! Ask yourselves how comfortable your lives are! How protected you are by your parents. If you have any illness, everyone is busy and hurrying to call the doctor. This is certainly fortunate. We should know that to have a healthy body, we must exercise. The children of Jiangbei are our proof. Now even the young ladies in their boudoirs are not weak and delicate! How could we boys be so pathetically fragile! Fortunately, the schools have long paid attention to sports! Perhaps weakness will not exist, so there is no need to worry! There is very little in terms of production! On the isolated island, we see poor children doing small businesses like selling ice and selling newspapers. At the same time, during the escape, I also saw many children selling cigarettes. This is mostly driven by "life" to walk on the road to "eat." We should not despise small businesses. Look! Edison, Mussolini... great men of this kind have all done this small business. So we are not afraid of "low origins," as long as we "work hard"! I finally hope that you can find work to do during the summer vacation, so that you don't "eat idle rice."

### Everyone Must Get Up Early

— Chen Liang

Due to various environmental reasons, we all live in the city, and we don't get any fresh air every day. We can't get a quiet time every day. We eat coal ash, swallow the smelly "Casilan," and listen to the noisy and clamorous sounds... This is already a great misfortune. How can the city compare to the countryside? There are many trees, the air is good, there are few residents, and the environment is quiet. These two things are extremely beneficial to people.

What are the benefits? First, the air is good, which can make the body strong, the mind clear, and the energy sufficient, and everything is done happily. Second, the environment is quiet, which can make reading focused, concentration focused, and thinking clear. However, in a bustling city, there is no such enjoyment, except for going to the park. It's just that sometimes it's limited by time and economics, so there's no chance to go to the park often. Children: When you want to read some books, maybe the domino sound from the neighbor's house will come to disturb you. When you want to write, maybe the motor in the nearby workshop will vibrate your wrist. Especially in this hot season, you may extremely hate all kinds of disturbances that hinder your self-study, and think that there is no choice.

Here, I have an opinion: In summer, I hope children can get up especially early. Develop the habit of getting up early. Taking advantage of the hot weather, I think getting up early will not be difficult. After the habit of getting up early is formed, the lazy disease of getting up late will be defeated. The city during the day and night is indeed filled with coal gas and smog, but it is much better before six or seven o'clock in the morning. The high chimneys of the factories have not yet smoked, and the smoke from the kitchens of every household has not yet risen. There is no noise of pedestrians and vehicles outside. There is also no domino sound and lively human voices in the house. In this way, pushing open the window, the air is relatively fresh, and sitting in front of the window to read is the best thing to do. If you are afraid of waking others up, the sound of reading should be lowered. Moreover, the adults will not blame you even if you are awakened because they see that you are willing to study hard. In addition, writing, calculating problems, making sentences, composing essays, drawing... everything is extremely suitable, easy to understand, and easy to penetrate into the brain.

In the morning, the effectiveness of any work is more advanced than at other times. The ancients had a saying: "Getting up early for three days is like one day's work," which is to tell people that in the clear morning air and quiet people, concentrating on everything will often achieve twice the result with half the effort. Children: If you want to study hard, then everyone must get up early. It is better to go to bed early than to get up late. If you can do this, you don't necessarily have to envy the countryside.

### A Glimpse of Tunxi

— Bai Zheng

The Twenty-Eighth Record of Ming'er's Escape

The Jiangshan boat floated across the beautiful Fuchun River and wandered through the simple Xin'an River. Ming'er's group of refugees spent more than ten days of long life on the boat. Green mountains and clear waters, thatched houses and fields, big cities and small towns, they almost all heard and saw them. This has increased Ming'er's knowledge of life a lot, but the price they paid is also considerable.

At noon on the twelfth day of the boat's departure from Hangzhou, Ming'er scooped a bowl of rice and ate it with relish on the bow of the boat.

"We can arrive in Tunxi this evening." As soon as Ming'er heard the word Tunxi, he was very happy in his heart, because Ming'er was a bit tired of living on the boat, so he had asked the boatman several times how many days it would take to reach his destination, but he was always uncertain because they relied on the weather to eat, and the speed of smooth winds and smooth water and headwinds and headwinds differed greatly, and the changes in the weather were difficult to measure. But today, he said to Ming'er with great certainty.

"Can we arrive today? It's been more than ten days, which is considered slow." Ming'er said with a happy and slightly complaining tone.

"It's only been twelve days today, which is already fast. Once, we traveled from Hangzhou to Tunxi for a full twenty days, because the water was shallow and we were fighting headwinds every day, which was really hard work."

Ming'er saw a strip of houses lined up at the end of the vast river. At this time, on both sides of the river bank, you could often see fortresses standing like stone houses with square holes dotted on the stone walls covered with grass, indicating that they had weathered the wind and rain, showing an heroic spirit. Later, Ming'er learned that it was used by the local villagers during the Taiping Rebellion to resist foreign bandits.

"That's Tunxi over there." "Is Tunxi lively?" Ming'er's words had a purpose, because he had passed through many towns and cities since he boarded the ship in Hangzhou, but the towns and cities he landed on always disappointed him, because they were very deserted, with uneven stone roads, low and poor houses, and few shops, and few customers patronizing them. Commerce was of course pitifully deserted. Compared with Ming'er's hometown's bustling city, there was a world of difference. He had also spent such a long and boring life on the boat, and his spirit was inevitably very depressed, so he urgently needed to adjust it. Now that he heard that "Tunxi is coming soon," he hurriedly raised this question.

"Tunxi is really lively, and everything is available. The streets are wide, the shops are many, rickshaws, bicycles, and cars come and go on the streets, and there are other things to play with. Except for Hangzhou, Tunxi is not considered not lively, so many people call it 'Little Shanghai,' which is really not wrong at all." The boatman said while recalling all his impressions after arriving in Tunxi before.

Ming'er was delighted to hear the boatman boast about how lively and fun Tunxi was, and his heart burst into a smile. He hoped to arrive in Tunxi sooner so he could have a good time.

But although they saw it, he asked the boatman and there were still more than ten miles to go. The more anxious he was, the slower the boat traveled. The river surface also gradually narrowed a lot, and was more winding than before. The boat was really like a worm crawling winding on a smooth snake's body. The sun was also constantly moving westward. Ming'er stood still on the bow of the boat, widening his eyes and looking. The houses were much closer, and the towering masts beside that big tree were like bamboo shoots after the rain, standing tall on the horizon, and a hungry eagle flapping its wings and circling, looking for its target.

They did not arrive in Tunxi until it was dark.

### Little Carpenter in the Summer Vacation, Little Dancer

— Xinsheng

Children, I think you can have time to make this small woodworking project during the long summer vacation besides reviewing the old textbooks and preparing the new books for the second half of the year; one is that the production is simple and you can practice your handicraft skills, and the other is that after it is made, it can be used for various games.

The tools, materials, and production methods required for its production are as follows:

Tools: Small knife or small saw

Materials: Plywood (3.5 inches long and 2.5 inches wide), a small piece of three pieces, paint (various colors), glue, small nails,

Production method: First, according to the first picture, draw the face, body, limbs, and other parts of the little dancer on the plywood, and then use a small knife or small saw to cut it down to become a human shape. Then, use colored paint to paint the hair and facial features on the head. The color of the clothes can be painted into various patterns, or cut from patterned cloth and glued to the wood chip; if you are tired of the trouble of painting with oil paint, or there is no colored paint, you can change to a piece of drawing paper, draw the human shape on it, apply color, and then glue it on the wooden board, and then cut it. After the human shape is made, another long piece of wood is used to cut a round handle with a small knife (as shown in Figure 2) and glue it to the front and back of (1) (as shown in Figure 3). If you are tired of the trouble of cutting, you can use a long narrow strip of wood and nail it on with small nails to replace it, but when holding it, it is not as comfortable between the fingers as a round handle. In addition, take two small pieces of wood (each 1 inch long, 0.5 inches high, and 0.75 inches wide), and cut them into small wooden shoes according to Figure 4 with a small knife. The size of the shoe opening must be dug out according to the size of each person's index finger and middle finger so that they can be put on the fingers. Apply paint to the wooden shoes or apply them with colored ink. If so, the entire work is completed.

As for the playing method: Hold the handle on the back of the human figure with the middle finger and index finger of the right hand or left hand, and put a pair of wooden shoes on the fingertips respectively, so that you can do various jumping games. If sisters and children play together, it is even more fun!

### From the Animal Realm (12)

— Xin Qing

An old female cat angrily shouted, "Enough with the nonsense! That scoundrel Peng Qi is extremely cruel and has committed all sorts of inhumane atrocities. Now there's nothing else to say, only to repay him in kind, one by one. Humph, he's a child, I say, he's a proper, bona fide child!"

One, 　, 　! The old male frog croaked again. It seemed to be considering the case as well.

The lion said very gently to the crowd, "Fellow creatures, we don't need to listen to any more testimonies against the criminal. His atrocities have already been proven by the facts. Even if he tries to blame Mr. Le Fu for the abuse of our cat brothers, it won't work. What we need to decide now is how to punish him. But since you have entrusted the power of judgment to me, then I must ask you to wait calmly and quietly, while I walk around three circles to carefully consider this matter."

But the lion walked around three circles and still couldn't decide. So, it increased its pace and walked around seven circles in a row, constantly wagging its tail. Finally, it returned to its original seat and sat down heavily. The old male frog raised its green head, waiting for the lion's judgment.

The lion said solemnly, "Fellow beasts, birds, and fish, I have given this case careful consideration, and I believe my decision will not cause any opposition from you. Our friend, Mrs. Female Cat, has said that the methods this criminal used to abuse cats in the past should be repaid to him in kind."

### Miscellaneous Notes on Yunnan Opera (Kunming Correspondence)

— Liao Zhi

The structure, singing, dialogue, and musical accompaniment of Yunnan opera are quite similar to Beijing opera. Moreover, many of the plays performed are also those found in Beijing opera. For example, "San Niang Teaches Her Son," "A Mother Executes Her Son," "The Pearl Curtain Case," and "The Battle of Jieting" are all consistent with the plots and texts of Beijing opera. The melodies of the songs are also similar to those of the Han tune and Cantonese opera in Beijing opera, making them quite melodious and pleasing to the ear. The acting and expressions are also serious and meticulous. Among the various operas in our country, it should occupy a superior position. It is a pity that it has always been performed only in Yunnan Province, and no one has ever formed a troupe to perform in Hong Kong, Macau, or other places. Therefore, those who want to watch Yunnan opera must go to Yunnan Province in person. This is why Yunnan opera is not well known to people across the country.

Yunnan opera also has the distinction between Xipi and Erhuang. The rhythm and beat are also similar to those of Beijing opera. However, the embellishments of the words and the spoken dialogue are purely in the Yunnan dialect and tone, which is a characteristic of its local flavor.

Tan Xinpei of Yunnan

The current leading figure in Yunnan opera is Su Cheng, who is highly regarded. He is over sixty years old and does not often perform on stage. One evening, at the special request of various circles, he performed the play "A Mother Executes Her Son" on the New Yunnan Stage. Those who attended went to see it. Although there was not much singing or dialogue in this play, Su's exquisite and mature artistry could be seen at a glance. His appearance was extremely delicate, much like Tan's later years. His acting was also very meticulous, quite different from ordinary actors. It is believable that his reputation is well deserved and not accidental. There is also an old actor named Zhu Bayin, who sings Qingyi roles. His position is equivalent to that of the late Chen Delin (Shitou) in the Beijing opera world. He also does not often perform these days. He was scheduled to perform on the New Yunnan Stage last month, but unfortunately, I was unable to hear it due to 　　.

Many teahouses in Kunming have Yunnan opera performances, with Taihua Chun on Jinbi Road being the most famous. Among the performers, 　 Chu is particularly well-known.

Female Actor Xiao Lanchun

Xiao Lanchun sings the role of Laosheng (old male), and is bold, forthright, handsome and unrestrained, and has the air of a heroine. I have heard her perform "The Pearl Cave Fortress," playing Chen Jingsi (the Yunnan opera version of "The Pearl Cave Fortress" features Chen Jingsi as the main character, while Li Keyong is played by a painted-face actor in a supporting role), and "Slaying Zongbao" (i.e., the Beijing opera "Slaying the Son at the辕门"), both of which had extremely pleasing singing. She is fair-skinned and has a graceful bearing. Her attire is also quite fashionable, unlike the women of the general Yunnan region. Before hearing her speak, one would not know that she is from Yunnan.

The other night, I went with friends to Taihua to listen to "Yutang Chun" and the plays of Zhuo Fang and Cao. The lyrics and melodies are almost identical to those of Beijing opera. My friend also suspected that Yunnan opera must have been taught by actors from the old capital, so everything is largely the same. There have been several large-scale migrations in Yunnan's history, such as when Wu Sangui entered Yunnan at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty. Many of his followers were people from Yan (present-day Beijing), among whom there must have been people belonging to the pear garden profession.

The Origin of Yunnan Opera

Perhaps this is the reason, but unfortunately, I have not had time to study it in depth. The Yunnan financier, Mr. Miao 　tai, is an avid fan of Beijing opera, and is especially knowledgeable about Yunnan opera. He can also sing, but he is reluctant to show it easily. One day, several celebrities gathered at a banquet, and Miao was also present. Everyone asked Miao to sing, but Miao declined repeatedly. Everyone insisted, and Miao said that he would try his best after drinking to his heart's content. However, he never sang after drinking.

The instrumental accompaniment of Yunnan opera (i.e., the musical ensemble) is even more similar to that of Beijing opera. However, each 　 carries a [tanggu drum] to keep the rhythm, which is one point that is completely different from Beijing opera.

### "Defend Our Homeland" Premieres in Chongqing, Starring Ying Yin: A Record of Bloodied Treatment

— Hui Cun

Serious Performance During Filming, Knife Wound to Blood Vessel

Large Number of Viewers Send Letters of Condolence

Ying Yin can be said to be one of the most outstanding female actors in China today. We will not forget her excellent performance as Wu Zetian in the amateur troupe's performance of "Wu Zetian" in previous years, which left a deep impression on general theatergoers.

She is twenty-two years old this year. She studied in Peiping (present-day Beijing) when she was young, so she has spoken fluent Mandarin since she was a child. Later, she studied at a certain girls' school in Nanchang. It is said that her father is Manchurian, while her mother is Cantonese. Before the war, she was a basic actor in an amateur troupe, and she also appeared on the screen.

After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, she followed the amateur troupe to the inland to engage in theatrical work. When she was in Hankou, she became ill due to the hardship of the work. She returned to Shanghai via Peiping. However, after she recovered, she transferred to Hong Kong and then to the inland, and finally from Han to Chongqing. At that time, the amateur troupe had disbanded, and she joined [China Electric] as an actor through the introduction of someone named Pan. Later, she left [China Electric] and joined [China Manufacturing]. From time to time, she also participated in the drama performances of Chongqing film and theater people. Her first stage appearance in Chongqing was in "The True Story of Ah Q." After that, she performed in plays such as "General Mobilization," "National Glory," "Long Live the Nation," and "One Week." Her acting skills were quite skilled and profound, and were unanimously praised by the audience.

The first film she starred in after joining "China Manufacturing" was "Defend Our Homeland," a film directed by He Feiguang about rural education and national salvation. During the filming of this film, there was a scene in which Ying Yin and a Japanese military officer were fighting over a knife. It was probably too intense. The actor playing the Japanese military officer 　 moved the knife and accidentally cut her blood vessel. Thus, what was supposed to be a staged act turned into a real injury, and Ying Yin stayed in the hospital for a period of time.

When this film "Defend Our Homeland" was completed, it was screened last month at Chongqing's only remaining "Weiying Cinema," while the film's protagonist, Ying Yin, was still recovering in the hospital. When the general audience learned of this news, they all wrote letters of condolence to her because her realistic performance on the screen deeply moved the general audience. Therefore, she received a lot of letters of condolence every day in the hospital. In addition, some people sent them to the newspaper office to be published on their behalf.

Although letters of condolence are very popular at the moment, she is probably the first female actor and film actor to receive a large number of letters of condolence!

### Idle Talk About the Entertainment World

(12) Cantonese Opera

Because of the barrier of dialect, this purely southern-style Cantonese opera cannot be as popular as other [local operas]. In terms of lyrics, although there are many obscure and difficult-to-understand words, generally speaking, it is worthy of the comment [elegant and refined]. Several opera lyrics can almost represent a wide range of [literature].

It is a pity that the melody and tone always have a bit of a [stiff] feeling!

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Differences in Inviting Performers, Past and Present

Generally speaking, the place where this single person sits is always at the stage entrance facing the exit. In the old-fashioned teahouses (theaters, mostly called teahouses), there were tables for eight immortals arranged in front of the stage. Perhaps five tables could be arranged in a row, and at most five or six rows could be arranged. These were all called pool seats. Behind the pool seats and on the left and right sides, there might be several long benches. If the floor space was small, the pool seats would be surrounded by railings, and everything outside the railings would be sold as standing room. There were also a few called crane seats. Generally, those who sat in the pool seats were local gentry, wealthy households, big business owners, or people in officialdom. They sat upright at the table, and those who faced the stage were more respected than those who sat on both sides of the table and leaned against the table with their backs. Therefore, whenever a performer invited to perform and his companions entered the teahouse, they would deliberately dress up as wealthy merchants, sit in the center of the table, and one or two of their attendants would sit on either side. In the old-fashioned theaters, the pool seats could accommodate a maximum of three or four people. Therefore, when a performer on stage made a sound of praise for someone in a certain seat, the people on stage could recognize it very clearly. The performer inviting the performance would naturally always applaud the performer he was targeting to get his attention. He would originally sit at the stage entrance of the exit (anyone who knows how to listen to opera will choose to sit at the stage entrance of the exit). If the performer happened to be singing the next sentence and entering the backstage, he would always turn around and stand at the stage entrance, sing the scattered beat of the next sentence, and then enter the stage. At this time, the person on stage and the person inviting the performance were only a foot away from each other, and all actions and words could be conveyed from the stage to the performer.

Everyone has a [climbing this mountain and looking at that mountain is higher] mentality. A famous performer who has stayed in the original place for a long time will inevitably want to change places and play around. Moreover, if his seats sell well, he feels that this is a great achievement. Not only does he want to increase the monthly payment to the theater owner, but his temperament and temper will also become much larger.
