### European Situation: Intricate Maneuvering; Various Countries Seek to Consolidate Rear Guard, Military, and Economic Positions; Turkish Military Delegate Passes Through France En Route to England; Italian Foreign Minister Arrives in Germany; Berlin Reports Hitler's Peace Terms

London (Reuters Military Correspondent): If the Soviet Union agrees to immediately dispatch troops to aid Germany, the point of attack would most likely be in the Bessarabia region of Romania. Therefore, the Romanian government has continued to mobilize reserve forces and send them to the border there for defense. It is unlikely that the Red Army would take distracting actions elsewhere. Military experts consider claims of Soviet attacks on India's Northwest Frontier and a joint German-Soviet defense against Allied forces on the Western Front incredible, especially the notion of the Red Army invading France by parachute. (Reuters, 30th)

London: There are rumors that Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu has accepted an invitation from the Soviet government to visit Moscow. Although this has been denied by Romanian sources, British diplomatic circles are paying close attention to it, considering it more important than Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's trip to Berlin. It is widely believed that the "peace offensive" undertaken by Germany and the Soviet Union claims to have the "support of friendly nations," likely referring to Italy. However, regardless of which nations Germany secures support from, the Anglo-French nations would certainly not condone Germany’s conquest of Poland. After the rejection of this "offensive" by England and France, Italy and the Soviet Union may not actively assist Germany. As for Romania, the Soviet Union may exert strong pressure on it to either reclaim Bessarabia Province (formerly part of Russia before the start of the European War) or at least demand that Romania follow Soviet policy. It is difficult to determine what advice England and France can offer to the Romanian authorities. If Romania requests assistance from England and France in accordance with existing treaties, those countries would be obligated to fulfill their mutual assistance commitments. In essence, Romania is situated between Germany and the Soviet Union and is threatened from both sides, placing it in a very difficult position. Generally, it should adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the Soviet Union. (Havas, 30th)

Rome: People here are closely monitoring German-Soviet relations and their impact on Europe amid an atmosphere of uncertainty, but they do not speculate that a German-Soviet conflict is inevitable. Italy has a special relationship with the Balkan Entente. If the Soviet Union aims to spread Pan-Slavism, Italy's influence in the region would be greatly diminished. Current Soviet-Turkish negotiations are also being watched closely by people in Italy. According to Italian observers, Bessarabia will soon be annexed by the Soviet Union. However, Hungary is unlikely to be threatened by the Soviet Union. As a Catholic nation, Italy is easily provoked by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the news that Poland is about to be Sovietized has deeply impressed Italy. Italy has no intention of starting a war, except for the opportunity that war presents to easily realize its aspirations in Africa. It is believed that these aspirations can be achieved peacefully. Italy wants to revitalize trade with England and France, at the very least. The influence of Soviet westward expansion is also a major reason for Italy's desire to unite with England and France. (Reuters, 1st)

Capital of Romania: The economic negotiations between Germany and Romania have recently concluded. According to the new commercial agreement negotiated by both parties, the import quotas for both countries have only been slightly relaxed compared to the original quotas. (Havas, 30th)

Paris: The Turkish military delegation led by General沃培 has arrived here this morning. High-ranking British and French officers greeted them at the station. This trip

London: Reuters has learned that the delegation led by Turkish General 沃培 is expected to arrive in London in the middle of next week to discuss British-Turkish economic and financial matters. (Reuters, 30th)

Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu invited British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds and French Chargé d'Affaires Baya for talks at 6 PM and is scheduled to return to his country tomorrow morning. (Havas, 20th)

Moscow: A German economic delegation, led by Dr. Schnurr, a specialist from the Economic Department of the German Foreign Ministry, is expected to arrive here shortly to discuss various details of economic cooperation with the Soviet authorities. (Havas, 30th)

Capital of Belgium: It has been learned that representatives from England and Belgium are scheduled to hold economic talks in London next week to promote trade between the two countries. (Havas, 30th)

Munich: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived at Munich Central Station at 8:18 this morning. The Italian Consul General in Munich, Bitalli, greeted him at the station. At 8:33, Ciano's private train departed for Berlin. (Haitong, 1st)

Dutch Capital: A correspondent for the local "Telegraph" newspaper in Berlin claims that, according to the most reliable sources, Hitler's "peace proposal" essentially consists of two points: (1) the establishment of a buffer state in Poland; (2) the convocation of a five-power conference to resolve all outstanding issues. It is said that this proposal will be conveyed to the British and French governments by Mussolini. (Reuters, 1st)

### Air Battles on the Western Front: British and German Aircraft Each Shoot Down Two; Saarbrücken Surrounded on Three Sides

Paris: The European war has now lasted for a month. Officials here generally predict that French troops will soon occupy Saarbrücken. French Communiqué No. 54 was released yesterday, stating that German forces east of the Moselle River and French forces near the Luxembourg border engaged in heavy artillery fire yesterday. Allied and German aircraft also took to the air for combat. French officials believe that German forces will launch a major counterattack between Saarbrücken and Luxembourg to regain lost territory on the Rhine front. The German people of Saarbrücken have already evacuated. French forces have surrounded the city on three sides, and the German army will not be able to hold it for long. (Associated Press, 1st)

London: The Information Department has issued a statement stating, "Several British aircraft flew to northern Germany last night for reconnaissance and safely returned to base afterward. In addition, the battle situation between British and German aircraft on the Western Front in Germany yesterday is worth mentioning. A small squadron of our reconnaissance aircraft encountered a large squadron of enemy fighter planes and engaged them in combat, shooting down two enemy aircraft. The downing of one of these aircraft has been confirmed by the French." (Havas, 1st)

Berlin: The German High Command issued a statement today stating that air combat occurred in the West, with two French aircraft and ten British aircraft engaging German aircraft. Over the North Sea, two British aircraft were shot down, and the German side also lost two aircraft. Since the start of the war a month ago, the German Air Force and anti-aircraft units have shot down a total of 37 French aircraft and 27 British aircraft. (Haitong, 1st)

Paris: Reports that French troops are advancing along the right bank of the Moselle River towards Trier indicate that Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin has taken the lead in this area. At least as far as Trier, the railway is no longer available to the Germans. The large number of German prisoners captured by the French are all soldiers guarding the pillboxes of the Siegfried Line. General Gamelin's clearing operations are proceeding faster than most critics had anticipated. French forces have strengthened their position by advancing their lines on a five-and-a-half-mile front towards Bolchen, making it more secure and able to withstand any inevitable German counterattack. (Reuters, 30th)

Paris: French forces have recently advanced east of the Moselle River, greatly increasing the amount of German territory occupied by the French. The general trend of military operations is now forming an encirclement, moving closer to the central salient of the Siegfried Line. Although German forces are currently putting up a strong resistance to French pressure, the French commander has not lost the initiative for a single day. The French are gradually advancing on the Siegfried Line, giving the impression that they are implementing their military operations according to plan, enabling them to advance accurately and with minimal casualties. When Germany attempts to counterattack, they encounter rapidly constructed defensive positions and concentrated artillery fire from the French, resulting in the failure of the German counterattacks to delay the French advance. There have been no large-scale military operations on either side in the past 24 hours. French forces are currently consolidating their newly captured positions east of Apach and Berg, while German forces are sending out reconnaissance patrols with fewer personnel than usual. Military commentators today say that German operations on the Luxembourg end of the Siegfried Line are greatly hampered, and the German side may soon violate Luxembourg's neutrality to allow German forces more room to maneuver. News from Switzerland that German forces are concentrating in the Black Forest has also attracted general attention, as the area contains a major German route to the Rhine River. While it is difficult for German forces to cross the Rhine, it should not be assumed that they cannot do so, as German forces crossed the Danube River at Belgrade in 1915 under French fire. (Reuters, 30th)

London: According to official sources, British reconnaissance aircraft flew over the German Siegfried Line a few days ago and took many extremely detailed photographs. The positions of German artillery batteries, tank trenches, the German rear communications network, and various camouflage methods have all been photographed. These reconnaissance aircraft flew very low when photographing enemy terrain, sometimes as low as six hundred feet. Enemy anti-aircraft batteries often mistook them for German aircraft, allowing them to safely return to base. These photographs have all been submitted to the headquarters of the British Expeditionary Force. (Havas, 30th)

### Soviet Newspaper Reaffirms Policy of Peace

Moscow: An editorial in today's "Izvestia" states, "The Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact, despite the conspiracies of certain countries that have tried hard to provoke a German-Soviet conflict, has finally been successfully concluded, becoming an obstacle to challengers inciting a pan-European war. This will certainly be recognized by all mankind, or at least by those with clear minds who can accurately assess the facts. The world must recognize this historical document as an extremely important instrument of peace. The world must know that if the Soviet Union had not consistently adhered to a policy of peace, if there had not been a Soviet-German treaty serving to implement this policy, the whole world would have been plunged into an unprecedented war, more terrible than the imperialist slaughter of 1914-1918. The current imperialist war in Europe has thus been localized and its scope reduced. Soviet leaders will never allow challengers to drag the country into an unnecessary war, thereby sparing 170 million people from the ravages of war. The expansion of the European war has also been limited." (TASS, 30th)

### Finnish Official Criticizes Soviet-Estonian Treaty

Capital of Finland: Sven Tuomioja, Chairman of the Finnish Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized the Soviet-Estonian treaty yesterday, stating that Estonia has effectively lost its neutral status, that its foreign policy will be constrained by the Soviet Union, that it has become a military ally of the Soviet Union, and that it has completely submitted economically to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has become the leader of the northern Baltic Sea. (Associated Press, 1st)

Capital of Estonia: Estonian Navy Commander-in-Chief Mere has been dismissed today due to the escape of a Polish submarine. Several other senior military officers will be court-martialed. (Reuters, 20th)

Capital of Sweden: According to reliable sources from all sides, Germany has granted the Soviet Union freedom of action in Latvia. However, the Soviet Union is unlikely to take drastic measures against Latvia, as it has done against Estonia. The first step is said to be a demand for special rights in the ports of Liepāja and Ventspils, so that the Soviet Union can have access to the sea in the areas it has already occupied in Poland. (Havas, 2nd)

### German Side Attaches Importance to This Week's Developments; Hitler Still Hopes for a Change in the Overall Situation

Berlin: According to political figures here, the most important events for Germany and the world will occur this week. The convening of the German Parliament, the arrival of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Berlin, the German army's occupation of Warsaw, and the upcoming speeches by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Premier Daladier all indicate that this week will be a week of major international events. Whether England and France accept the German-Soviet peace proposal or continue to fight will be revealed this week. (Haitong, 1st)

Berlin: Hitler invited his Axis partner, the Italian Foreign Minister, to Berlin yesterday for an emergency meeting and scheduled a parliamentary session for next Thursday to deliver an important declaration. Hitler also met with cabinet members and key figures from the army and navy yesterday for a 50-minute discussion. (Associated Press, 1st)

Rome: Regarding Foreign Minister Ciano's trip to Berlin, most newspapers have made little comment. Only the "Messenger" newspaper published a dispatch from its correspondent in Berlin, stating, "German leader Hitler is currently in Berlin and can personally receive Foreign Minister Ciano. The importance attached to this trip by German officials is evident. Moreover, this trip comes after Germany announced its willingness to present peace proposals jointly with the Soviet government, indicating that the European situation may have decisive developments within the next week." Furthermore, all newspapers believe that it is expected that Hitler will deliver an important speech and propose peace when the German Parliament convenes in the coming days, but it is still difficult to predict its scope and nature. (Havas, 1st)

Berlin: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will arrive in Berlin at 6 PM today for a short visit, leaving for Rome no later than tomorrow evening. It is claimed here that Ciano's visit is a natural result of the new situation created by the German-Soviet agreement and will not produce any surprising developments. Germany, in view of the changing situation, hopes to contact key Italian figures to inform Italy of various new developments. This consultation is also an obligation stipulated in the German-Italian agreement. Ciano is expected to discuss with German authorities Mussolini's efforts for peace. Mussolini is eager to end the war as soon as possible. People here generally believe that Ciano's visit should not be seen as a surprising action, but the visit is valued because there will be important developments in the European situation this week. (Haitong, 1st)

Paris: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's trip to Berlin is being commented on here. It is widely believed that Germany, with the help of the Soviet Union, is likely to adopt a "peace offensive." The moderate "Order" newspaper reported that "Hitler intends for the 'peace offensive' to be awe-inspiring, and in addition to Soviet support, he should also court several countries to strengthen its momentum. Although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini expressed his support for peace in a speech to the leaders of the Fascist Party in Bologna on September 23, Hitler wants the country to implement the 'Pact of Steel' signed with Germany, not just pay lip service. This is why Ciano was invited to Germany." The right-wing "Petit Journal" stated, "The peace efforts of Germany and the Soviet Union are bound to fail. Germany and its allies will also be defeated in a protracted war. Hitler is well aware of this, so he plans to persuade the Catholic countries to mediate, but England and France will resolutely reject it, which can be asserted." The right-wing "Journal" stated that the German-Italian military and political agreement (established on May 28 of this year, the so-called Pact of Steel) stipulates that the signatory countries should exchange views whenever necessary. Ciano's trip to Berlin shows that the situation is no more serious than it is today. (Havas, 1st)

### Minorities in Germany Total 29 Million

Dutch Capital: After Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned Polish territory, German newspapers described the areas that the country acquired at length, but deliberately omitted the number of minorities within the "Greater German Reich." In fact, before the partition of Poland, Germany already had 9 million Czechs, 1.5 million Poles, and 500,000 Slovaks within its borders, totaling 11 million, accounting for 12% of the country's total population. Today, with the addition of 18 million residents in the newly occupied areas of Poland, the total number of minorities has reached 29 million, equivalent to over 28% of the country's total population. From now on, Germany has become the second Slavic country in Europe (its total number of Slavic residents is second only to the Soviet Union), and it will undoubtedly become an excellent target for Soviet propaganda. (Havas, 30th)

### French Military Authorities Confer, Discuss Strategy Against Germany; Resolve to Defeat Hitlerism, Unshaken by German-Soviet Declaration

Paris: French Premier Daladier today held a meeting with cabinet members in charge of defense, such as Allied Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin, Naval Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Darlan, and Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Vuillemin, to discuss "strategic issues of far-reaching importance." General Georges, commander of the northeastern army, who inspected the front line with President Lebrun yesterday, also attended the meeting. The meeting lasted half an hour. Afterward, Daladier met with President Lebrun for 45 minutes. (Reuters, 30th)

Paris: The Supreme Military Council met here yesterday to consider the situation caused by the Soviet-German peace declaration. It is widely believed that the Council decided that the Soviet-German declaration would not change the European situation. French Prime Minister Daladier instructed a government spokesman to inform journalists that France did not view the Soviet-German peace proposal as well-intentioned or acceptable. It is widely believed that France does not want any neutral country to mediate peace with Germany. The French government is trying to convince the German public that the threats from Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy cannot change the Allies' established policy of defeating Hitlerism in Europe. Pierre Brisson, editor of "Le Petit Parisien," summarized France's reaction to the Soviet-German peace declaration as follows: "This is very honorable for Hitler. He has made Poland disappear from the map. He wants to become a great peacemaker, signing a Munich agreement with England, a Paris agreement with France, and then resting for a few months. He will then prepare to launch a new attack in Europe, on Belgium, on France, who knows if he will not attack Italy one day." (Associated Press, 1st)

Editorial

### "Premature to Predict Peace"

The Sino-Japanese War has finally reached a conclusion, but what kind of conclusion? If left to run its natural course, what kind of conclusion would it reach? From China's perspective, what kind of conclusion should it reach? From Japan's perspective, what kind of conclusion should it reach? The immediate worries are such, the long-term concerns are like that, and how will it all conclude? For all these questions, the dominant and the subservient each have their own answers, making it extremely difficult to reach a consensus. Examining newspapers and magazines in both Shanghai and Tokyo, many commentators share a common malady. They invariably begin by hypothesizing a desired conclusion, and then seek reasons and explanations to support their conclusion, even to the point of distorting facts and reversing cause and effect. They spare no effort in slandering what they dislike and stop at nothing to vilify what they resent. Examples are too numerous to mention, too unbearable to cite. The momentous affairs of the two nations over a century cannot be resolved by mere eloquence, let alone by specious arguments. One only sees biased words, or thinks there is a shortcut to be found. In reality, they only add to the confusion and do little to resolve the situation, which is what discerning people lament. Mr. Tatsujiro Funatsu, a Japanese, recently told an English reporter for the American Evening News: "The Sino-Japanese war is still in an undecided stage. It is premature to predict peace between the two countries, as no one can say for sure how long the war will last." Mr. Funatsu has been in China for decades (the report says thirteen years, but the reporter remembers it being more), from Tianjin to Shanghai, from official to businessman, with a wealth of experience and a wide circle of friends. Since the January 28th Incident of 1932 to the present, he has suffered painful lessons. He has also gone from dazzling ambition to a more balanced outlook and is now retiring. At a time when the Japanese side believes there is a shortcut to be found, he makes the remark that it is "premature" to resolve the situation. Is this not the true insight of an elderly person?

Resolving this war situation could happen through a military solution, that is, the military forces of the belligerent countries, through a long period of combat, wax and wane, eventually reaching a point where one side has absolute strength for victory. In other words, Japan's forces are able to simultaneously control all of Northwest and Southwest China, and China's resistance forces completely disappear, which would be a Japanese victory. Otherwise, Japan's invading forces completely disappear, and China drives the Japanese army overseas, which would be a Chinese victory. This is one way to resolve the war. Or it could be due to political and economic reasons, either China has internal strife and no longer resists, or Japan has internal strife and no longer invades, or there are major international changes and immense power either oppresses Japan, or oppresses China, or simultaneously oppresses China and Japan. This is another way to resolve the war. The first way is in the midst of the struggle between the two sides, and we do not want to speculate. More than two years have passed, and to this day, both sides have confidence in this military solution. The second way is in the midst of the expectations of both sides, and we will not discuss the possibility of "change" being greater or more beneficial, but the mood of expecting the second way cannot be concealed by either side, but expecting the other side to change, expecting external changes, are all things without any certainty. The momentous affairs of the two nations over a century are floating and hesitating in this lack of certainty for each side. Can a resolution be expected?

From what we can perceive, although China cannot be certain of Japan's changes, or international changes, there are those who are enduring hardships and hesitations. Japan, being small, cannot be certain of China's and international changes, but its hesitation is actually greater. Considering the root of the war, China is passively resisting invasion and fighting for survival, so in fact, until the conditions for the nation's survival are absolutely guaranteed, there is absolutely no reason to give up the resistance. If it is said that the guarantee lies in China's sincerity and Japan's honesty, this is a subjective argument that may or may not be true, not a necessary objective fact. In Japan's case, is invasion necessary, must it be effective, can it be sustained, must it not be revised? Whether in theory, in intention, or in fact, at least none is absolute, none is inevitable, or even none is true. From the perspective of strategic gains and losses, the Japanese side has initially favored a quick and decisive victory. Now, wanting to stop but unable to, they still hope for a quick and decisive victory. Their talk of a ten-year war or a hundred-year war is unconscious bravado. Therefore, their pressing subtext is actually "If we cannot have a quick and decisive victory, then we only hope to be able to stop when we can." How to stop involves politeness, desires, and vanity, obscuring their wisdom. Therefore, they try to take detours as shortcuts, unable to restrain themselves. In China's case, it is clear that the quality of military equipment is inferior to others, but what is relied upon is quantity. Therefore, it is advantageous to "delay." Delay is not necessarily a problem. Albania in the past, and Poland recently, have problems in not being able to delay. Czechoslovakia and Austria's problem was in never delaying. If one can delay, why not delay? From the perspective of the international environment, Japan, with its wisdom unable to extricate itself, is being dragged by China. Furthermore, because of its international standing and other various relationships, it is extremely difficult to remain in a state of wavering ambiguity for a long time. China is only concerned with resisting Japan and can certainly ignore the various international groups and fronts. In order to cope with the international situation, Japan hopes that the so-called "China Incident" can be stopped as soon as possible. It also hopes to use China to its advantage in coping with international affairs, worrying that China will make it unable to cope with the international situation. In China's case, during this period of continued resistance, it can freely navigate the international scene through its resistance, without being subject to any restrictions. After the resistance ends, it will stand proudly as an independent and free country with complete sovereignty. No matter how chaotic the international situation, it will bury itself in rebuilding and educating the nation under subjective absolute neutrality, completing the great task of national construction and revival. If it is said that the Sino-Japanese War is able to be declared over by accepting certain restrictive conditions of the international community, but being involuntarily participating in a certain group or front of international chaos, then whether for the sake of current or long-term interests, it would rather drag Japan and continue the resistance until absolutely no restrictive conditions are accepted. In short, the day Japan is hostile to China is the day it loses its qualification to participate in world affairs. Assuming that Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy are one camp, and Britain, France, and the United States are another camp, assuming that Japan has the same possibility of joining any camp, but it will be bogged down in the quagmire of China, making it impossible to choose. Even if it joins, it will be weakened by the quagmire, with little remaining strength. Therefore, from the perspective of the international environment, it is the Japanese side that urgently needs to end the Sino-Japanese war. As for profiting from the European war, China does not have such extravagant hopes, and Japan should remember this.

The Japanese must know all that has been said above. The reason why they are trapped in hesitation and unable to extricate themselves is that they are blinded by politeness, desires, and vanity, still hoping to find a shortcut. On the Chinese side, as in the recent talks by Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, it was frank, straightforward, and unhindered. Even if those who misunderstand it point to it as seeking peace, pointing to it as seeking the United States, it is not enough to erase his distinction between peace and war. I hope that Japan today will want to make a frank and straightforward statement, but is unable to. For advance means war, and retreat means peace, all depending on Japan's actual actions, and Japan is hesitating like this. It is appropriate for discerning people to observe that "it is premature to predict peace!"

### The United States Strengthens the Far East Fleet's Strength, Hawaii to Hold Naval Maneuvers

Washington: The Navy Department strictly maintains secrecy regarding the movements of U.S. warships. Even the movements of the fleet expected to arrive in Hawaii in the third week to participate in exercises are not being announced by the Navy Department. The Navy Department's orders state that the reason for this secrecy is to implement "neutrality patrols." Although these "neutrality patrols" have not yet been implemented on the West Coast, important naval ports such as San Diego and San Pedro have received orders. The date of the Hawaiian Grand Maneuvers may not be announced publicly. More than one hundred warships and multiple aircraft carriers will participate in these Grand Maneuvers. The Navy Department also stated that it will increase the submarine strength of the Far East Fleet. After the new submarines arrive in the Far East, the old submarines will continue to serve and will not be withdrawn. With the addition of the aircraft carrier "Langley" and fourteen long-range bombers that arrived in Manila ten days ago, the strength of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet is already very strong.

### Observations from Chongqing: The Soviet Union Will Still Aid China, Little Possibility of Soviet-Japanese Compromise

Chongqing: News of a possible compromise between the Soviet Union and Japan, as reported by Rome, and that a tripartite alliance between Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan could be formed, is seen here as another way to pressure Britain. This news indicates that if Japan can advance south and threaten British interests, the Soviet Union is prepared to form an alliance with it. Those familiar with current affairs here believe that the Soviet Union is willing to assist in any action that could destroy the British Empire. The joint German-Soviet declaration is the most recent expression of this Soviet attitude. However, most people here believe that even if the Soviet Union and Japan compromise, the Soviet Union will not cease its aid to China. The Soviet Union has always maintained China's integrity, mainly because if China can remain intact, then there will be no problems for Siberia and the Maritime Provinces of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union will never help Japan conquer China. As for Britain compromising with Japan to prevent Japan's southward advance, it will be more detrimental to China than a Soviet-Japanese compromise. According to military sources, the possibility of a Soviet-Japanese compromise is extremely small, because before the armistice, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses in the Harbin River area. Therefore, for the sake of maintaining its honor, the Kwantung Army will soon seek revenge on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border. (United Press, 1st)

### Eastern German Troops Take Over Warsaw

Berlin: The German High Command announced in a communique today that Eastern German troops are following the planned procedure and taking over the cities of Warsaw and Modlin. (Haitong Telegraph, 1st)

Berlin: Hitler today ordered all German public institutions to fly flags for a week to celebrate the triumphant entry of German troops into Warsaw. (Reuters, 30th)

### German Submarine Warfare Intensifies, Declares Merchant Ships Will Be Treated the Same as Warships, Four Danish Ships Intercepted En Route to Britain

London: The Ministry of Information announced that a German radio station broadcast news yesterday claiming that in the past few days, German submarines have been attacked by British armed merchant ships. The German submarines have always respected international law and have always given prior warning before attacking merchant ships. However, in the future, in retaliation, they will change this attitude and treat British merchant ships the same as warships. It goes without saying that this German slander is completely unfounded. The British Admiralty, for the sake of precaution, has informed all merchant ships that German submarine warfare methods are about to intensify, so that they can take extra precautions. (Havas, 30th)

Berlin: Regarding the speech made by British Naval Minister Churchill in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that Britain plans to arm every merchant ship, the German newspapers today launched another large-scale attack. The "Hamburg Foreign Newspaper" declared that Germany has heard this intimidation and knows how to deal with it. In order to make Britain understand the possible consequences, it is explained that Germany's view on submarine warfare is as follows:

(1) No merchant ship may offer any resistance to measures taken by submarines according to the right of capture. (2) Armed merchant ships do not automatically become warships or auxiliary cruisers, but if they attack enemy ships, the enemy may treat them as warships because they are engaged in war activities. (3) The responsibility for illegally armed merchant ships rests entirely with the government under whose flag the merchant ship is sailing. (4) Neutral passengers who wish to travel on armed merchant ships bear the risk themselves. (Haitong Telegraph, 1st)

The Hague: A correspondent for the local "Electric News" recently telegraphed from the Danish capital that the four Danish ships "Roda," "Diana," "Margaret," and "Linus," carrying food to Britain, were all intercepted by German warships en route. The news has greatly shocked the Danish people, as the goods carried by these ships cannot be regarded as contraband. In addition, after the Norwegian freighter "Solaris" was sunk by a German warship the other day, the owner arrived in Denmark yesterday. According to him, the German warship did not issue a warning before attacking the ship. The Danish authorities and people are becoming increasingly concerned about the safety of navigation. In addition, the German government has announced that grain carried by neutral ships will not be regarded as contraband unless it is delivered to enemy government offices. The grain carried by the above four ships was not delivered to the British government, but was arbitrarily detained by German warships, which is puzzling. (Havas, 1st)

Berlin: The German High Command announced yesterday that the German blockade of Britain has also been dealt with in the same way. In the past forty-eight hours, German warships have searched a total of forty-five ships, many of which have been escorted to German ports and the goods confiscated. Regarding the British air force bombing of the Heligoland fleet on Thursday, the military also released additional information, stating that two German destroyers were forced to land on the sea, and the crew were rescued by German warships. (United Press, 1st)

### Belgium Increases Defense on Northern Border, German-Dutch Traffic Cut Off

Paris: The "Paris Evening News" received news from Luxembourg last night that Belgian troops stationed on the French border have suddenly been transferred to the northern Belgian border near the Netherlands. Belgian troops are building new defensive fortifications on the Albert Canal and the Demer River. (United Press, 1st)

(Ottenchael, German-Dutch border) The German military has ordered German troops here to keep a distance of at least three hundred English feet from the Dutch border, and German people are prohibited from contacting Dutch soldiers, causing the situation here to suddenly become tense. Starting from 5:00 AM tomorrow, the border between the two countries will be closed, prohibiting all traffic. Dutch people are not allowed to enter German territory, except in a certain place near the village of Granna, where they can pass if they obtain a special pass. This special pass must be signed by the head of the German Defense Forces before it is valid. (United Press, 1st)

### Germany Rebuts British Excerpt

Berlin: The German government had published a White Paper explaining the events leading to the German-Polish conflict. The British tried to prove its errors, and today the German authorities made a strong rebuttal. It is said that the German White Paper has collected all the key documents, but the editing of the documents has principles, and documents describing the general climate, as well as records of conversations, are not included. If the British use this as an excuse to accuse the German government of intending to conceal important information, then the method they adopt is inevitably naive. The following are the main points of the British refutation that are refuted:

(1) The British claimed that the German White Paper sought to state that Britain opposed Germany's right to issue an ultimatum to Poland at the beginning of Germany's ultimatum to Poland. According to the ultimatum, Poland had to send an envoy to Berlin at 12:00 PM on August 30 and had to accept Germany's proposal. The German side replied that the British claim that Germany's request was an ultimatum was inconsistent with the facts. The German government did not cause any consequences for the deadline of August 30. Only on the night of August 31 did it believe that diplomatic strategies had been exhausted. The British intelligence office, after consulting the report of its ambassador (which has been reprinted in the Blue Book), knew that Chancellor Hitler had answered Ambassador Henderson's question with "of course." What Mr. Henderson asked was whether the Polish envoy could conduct negotiations based on the principle of complete equality. From this, the British attitude can be seen. As for the attitude of the British, the German government did not know until the night of August 30 that the British government believed that the contact between Germany and Poland on August 30 was impossible to implement.

(2) The British also claimed that the author of the White Paper and the German government ignored Poland's right to know, consider, and respond to Germany's proposal. The German side replied that according to the reply in the previous article, it can be seen that the procedure of the German proposal and the wishes of the Polish government can coexist without conflict. Furthermore, the British government still had the opportunity to notify Poland of the content of the German proposal on August 31, because Ambassador Henderson had reported the German proposal to London on the 30th and transmitted it to the British Embassy in Warsaw. The British Blue Book reveals the existence of this fact. (Haitong Telegraph, 1st)

### The Battle Outside Changsha: Chinese Forces Gain the Upper Hand; Japanese Troops Completely Annihilated East of Qiaotouyi; Chinese Forces Also Report Victory at Dayun Mountain; Phoenix Mountain and Other Locations Recovered

Guilin: The battle situation outside Changsha has clearly taken a turn for the better. A high-ranking Chinese officer, after arriving at the front lines, immediately directed the various armies to launch a major counteroffensive. From Qiaotouyi to Longmenchang, along a 200-kilometer line, fierce battles are taking place everywhere. Among them, Dahaozhuao (45 li east of Qiaotouyi) and the southeast of Pingjiang are particularly intense. By yesterday morning, over a thousand Japanese troops at Dahaozhuao had been completely annihilated by Chinese forces, with almost no survivors. This is the most significant defeat the Japanese army has suffered since crossing the Mishui River. Chinese forces in other areas have also made considerable gains. In this battle in northern Hunan, although the Japanese army used mobile units to occupy some Chinese strongholds, due to the terrain, heavy weaponry and mechanized units have completely lost their effectiveness. The Chinese forces, on the other hand, can utilize the familiar mountainous terrain to cut off the lines between strongholds at any time, causing each point to be isolated and unstable. According to news from the front this afternoon, 7,000 to 8,000 Japanese troops northeast of Changsha are trapped between Qiaotouyi and Jinjing, awaiting reinforcements due to the Chinese counteroffensive. As for the Japanese troops advancing southwest from Longmenchang towards Pingjiang, over 2,000 of them were engaged in battle on the 30th in the Qilishant area west of Changshou Street, which they captured on the 29th. Another group of Japanese troops advancing south from near Pingjiang encountered strong resistance from Chinese forces at Jiangcun (15 kilometers south of Pingjiang) and Hengcha (10 kilometers southeast of Pingjiang), suffering heavy casualties. This group of Japanese troops seems to be trying to join forces with the Japanese troops advancing west from Changshou Street. Another small group in civilian clothing is fleeing southwest, attempting to infiltrate Shegang (30 kilometers southwest of Pingjiang). In addition, intense fighting is also reported on the Mufu Mountain side north of Pingjiang. (1st dispatch)

Gao'an: Chinese forces launched an attack on Japanese troops near Phoenix Mountain northeast of Gao'an on the night of the 30th, encountering over two hundred Japanese troops. After fierce fighting for a long time, the Japanese were defeated and retreated by the morning of the 1st. The Chinese then recovered Phoenix Mountain, Lailong Mountain, and Yanzi Cliff, killing over thirty Japanese soldiers and seizing seven rifles, documents, and a large amount of military supplies. (1st dispatch)

Guilin: Military news: According to refugees who escaped from Xinqiang, the Japanese Sixth Division suffered extremely heavy casualties in the battle south of Xinqiang. There were over a thousand corpses, which were transported to Gaiweiyue. (1st dispatch)

Hengyang: According to a telephone call from Changsha, the fighting along the northern section of the Yuehan Railway is still stable. Chinese forces achieved a major victory at Dayun Mountain south of Yueyang today, annihilating over a thousand Japanese troops. The Japanese at Liuxingshan opposite Yingtian used poison gas today, poisoning eight Chinese soldiers and over ten nearby civilians. (1st dispatch)

Guilin: The Japanese have increased their forces on the Hunan-Jiangxi front to six divisions. In northern Jiangxi, the Japanese seem to be planning to attack Xiushui and Tonggu. The Japanese forces at Shawopu, south of Xiushui, have increased to 4,000 to 5,000. Their vanguard has already invaded Pengqiao. On the morning of the 30th, over 2,000 Japanese troops, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Fengshuao (south of Xiushui) position. After a bloody battle until noon, the Chinese forces voluntarily shifted to the Jiangjun'an line. Although the Japanese troops followed, they were still blocked in that area until nightfall. Over two hundred Japanese troops in civilian clothes were discovered near Daduan (26 kilometers northeast of Tonggu) on the morning of the 1st and have been repelled by the Chinese. (1st dispatch)

Hong Kong: According to military news obtained here today, the Japanese army has now advanced to a location 30 kilometers from Changsha and is engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese forces on the outer lines of Changsha. The Japanese army is forming a semi-circle around Changsha, and the Chinese forces are putting up strong resistance. It is reported that yesterday, after the Japanese army advanced to Qingshan City, one part of it attacked eastward, and was repulsed by Chinese forces at Jinjing, south of Pingjiang. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered 2,000 casualties. According to a statement issued by the spokesperson of the General Headquarters Military Affairs Bureau, since the fall of Wuhan last winter, Changsha has lost its military importance, especially during the war in Europe, and we must prepare for a long-term war. According to the spokesperson, since the beginning of the war of resistance, the Chinese strategy has been to wage a war of attrition against the Japanese. The gain or loss of a single city is not important. Furthermore, in Hunan alone, up to September 14th, the Chinese forces have annihilated four Japanese divisions. As for the Japanese forces annihilated by the Chinese forces in Jiangxi, they amount to three divisions. The spokesperson finally stated that the current goal of the Japanese military is to attempt to control Changsha, Changde, and Yichang. (1st Associated Press dispatch)

Chongqing: News received here today from the front lines of the Chinese army stated that some of the vanguard troops of the Japanese army have now reached the outskirts of Changsha. The Japanese troops north of Changsha are advancing south along the Yuehan Road, and it is reported that they reached Qiaotouyi yesterday morning. At the same time, the Japanese troops advancing towards Changsha from the east along the highway have reached Sanmiao City and Qingshan City (both transliterations) and Yongan City. Therefore, the Japanese army is now less than thirty miles from Changsha. A spokesperson for the Chinese army made a statement this morning regarding the rapid advance of the Japanese army, reiterating that the Chinese army commander intends to avoid positional warfare east of the Yuehan Road. It is said that since the fall of Hankou, Changsha is no longer an important position from a military perspective. Since the outbreak of the European war, China must continue to prepare for a long-term war of resistance. The spokesperson finally pointed out that in this battle in Hunan Province, the Chinese army has inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army. (1st Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing: A reporter, due to the intense fighting in the Hunan and Hubei areas, visited the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission to inquire about the recent battle situation in the Hunan and Hubei areas. It was reported that the goal of this Japanese offensive is clearly the line of Changsha, Changde, and Yichang. Our military strategy has long been determined to be a comprehensive war, with the aim of depleting the enemy's forces and striking at their main force. We will never contend for the gain or loss of a single city. Since the outbreak of the war, we have adhered to this policy without any changes. This battle in Hunan and Hubei is also the same. Moreover, since the abandonment of Wuhan last winter, Changsha is no longer a key point in our strategy, especially since the beginning of the European war. Our army should make plans for a protracted war and to deplete the enemy, and we are unwilling to engage in positional warfare in the area east of the Yuehan Line. Therefore, our army's future strategy is entirely to strike at the main force of the Japanese army, seeking to achieve the goal of a war of attrition. As for the gain or loss of any strongholds, it is not related to the final victory. In this battle in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, since it began on the 14th of this month, our army has annihilated more than half of the Japanese Inaba Division, Kan'ishi Division, Fujita Division, and Ogi Division, and that does not include the three divisions in Jiangxi that were defeated by our army. (30th dispatch)

Fancheng: Since the Chinese army launched a full-scale offensive in central Hubei, the Japanese troops in various places have been very panicked and have been frequently transferring troops to reinforce them in different directions, and recruiting civilian laborers to rush to repair highways, so as to reinforce each front line at any time. Yangzi has also increased its Japanese forces by over a hundred, attempting to defend its strongholds. Although the Japanese troops invading central Anhui have been repelled by the Chinese forces, the Japanese troops' goal is to seize food in the vicinity of Lujiang and Chaohu, and recently they are still attempting to infiltrate Yunchao from the Xiangxikou area from time to time. The Chinese have already sent powerful troops to guard against them. (1st dispatch)

Changsha: According to Japanese official broadcasts, this operation in northern Hunan has achieved nothing and is unprecedented in the many battles fought in China. The Japanese admitted that they are finding it difficult to advance because they are ambushed by Chinese forces everywhere. They also stated that the battles at Fulipu and Sanjieyu suffered particularly heavy damage, and they praised the spirit of heroic sacrifice of the Chinese defenders in those two places. It is reported that the □□□ division defended the area around Fulipu, and the Japanese attacked that place fiercely for several days and nights, and were repelled by brave fighting. Unable to disturb it, they had no choice but to change and harass Jinjing to the east. The Chinese achieved great results in blocking them. As for the area of Qijie Bridge in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway, it was defended by the □□□ unit, which not only delayed the actions of the Japanese army invading south, but also caused them to suffer huge losses. All of this is enough to prove that the Chinese army is becoming stronger and stronger. It is now known that Chairman Jiang has repeatedly praised the assistance of □, which is highly commended.

According to Chinese who have arrived here from the Kowloon border, Shatoujiao has been recaptured by Chinese forces, and Shenzhen is surrounded by 5,000 Chinese troops. It is reported that the Japanese troops defending Shenzhen number only 1,500, so the Japanese army can only take a defensive posture. Moreover, in order to disperse the Japanese army's strength, the Chinese army has deliberately stretched the front line to a width of thirty miles. (1st Associated Press dispatch)

### Japanese Planes Night Raid Various Locations in Hubei and Sichuan

Chongqing: At midnight on the 30th, large squadrons of Japanese planes again launched a sneak attack on various locations in Hubei and Sichuan. However, due to the dim moonlight, the Japanese planes blindly roamed around and had no targets to speak of. It is estimated that they were divided into three batches.

The second time, twenty-seven Japanese planes flew towards Chongqing at 9:00 PM, but after circling the city over Wanxian, they flew towards Hankou without dropping bombs. According to observations here, the reason why the Japanese planes did not drop bombs was that the clouds and fog were dense west of Wanxian, making it inconvenient. (1st Associated Press dispatch)

Chongqing: Although two alarms were issued here last night, no Japanese planes were seen flying in. It is reported that a batch of Japanese planes flew to Wanxian and then turned back, bombing Fengze (transliteration).

### A Miserable Defeat for Japanese and Puppet Troops in Zhongshan; Fierce Fighting All Day; Three Routes Fled in Disarray; Over 300 Japanese and Puppet Troops Ambushed and Captured

Shiqi Correspondence: Over the past two months, Japanese and puppet troops have peeped into Zhongshan three times. The first time, they invaded east of Zhongshan, concentrating on Jinzhong. The second time, they invaded west of Zhongshan, concentrating on Dieshi. From the middle of this month to the present, the third time, they have concentrated on the Hengmen Dawangtou area north of Zhongshan. However, in the first two times, only a small number of warships dispatched by the Japanese command assisted the puppet troops in the invasion, so they were unable to withstand a single blow from the Chinese self-defense teams. This third time, the two sides confronted each other for nearly ten days. Japanese and puppet troops dispatched land, sea, and air forces to invade with all their strength, launching fierce battles on three fronts. It was not until September 22 that the self-defense teams completely repelled the Japanese and puppet troops.

On September 15, Japanese and puppet troops concentrated their ships at Hengmen and invaded Xiaoyin, Licun, Zhangjiabian, and other areas. After being repelled by the Zhongshan self-defense teams, on the 18th, the Japanese army in Guangzhou transferred several hundred troops from the Akita unit, and Lu Chunrong also dispatched about a thousand puppet pacification troops to launch a large-scale invasion. Japanese fleets and aircraft also assisted in the advance. The central route took Dawangtou as its stronghold and invaded Xiaoyin and Dahuan. The left wing invaded from the Furong Mountain and Baimi Mountain area. The right wing took advantage of large warships to capture Zhangjiabian. On the 19th and 20th, the Japanese and puppet troops were fierce and menacing, and bombed the Chinese army's positions with a large number of planes. In order to avoid sacrifice, the Chinese army gradually withdrew to the Xiaoyin Licun Dahuan line. At that time, Shiqi was shaken, and the situation was precarious. On the 21st, fresh Chinese troops were transferred from a certain direction to Shiqi and added to the front lines. Various commanders personally went to the front lines to direct the battles. After fierce fighting all day, the Japanese and puppet troops on the central route were first repelled, and Dahuan, Xiaoyin, and other places were recovered. On the same afternoon, the Chinese army won victories on the left and right wings at Baimi Mountain and Zhangjiabian, killing over two hundred Japanese and puppet troops and recovering the positions in the Licun, Baimi Mountain, and Zhangjiabian areas. As a result, the Japanese and puppet troops on all three routes fled in disarray, gathering at Dawangtou Shanzhoukeng for accommodation, because the area was near the Hengmen coast and the Japanese and puppet troops could rely on the protection of the gunboats to hold on. Since the 23rd, there have been no traces of Japanese and puppet troops in Zhangjiabian, Xiaoyin Licun, Dahuan, Baimi Mountain, and Furong Mountain. Only a corner of Dawangtou still has puppet troops that have not retreated. The Chinese army is handling the post-war reconstruction, so it has temporarily suspended the attack on the 23rd and 24th. The situation in Zhongshan has suddenly eased. When the Chinese army launched a counterattack against the Japanese and puppet troops on the three routes north of Shiqi on the 21st (the battle was extremely fierce), it was unexpected that more than forty Japanese and puppet rubber boats, loaded with hundreds of puppet troops, suddenly appeared on the Shenwan sea surface south of Zhongshan, secretly landing near Shenwan, attempting to attack Qianshan and cut off Shiqi's retreat. The Chinese army had learned of this in advance and immediately dispatched self-defense teams to cooperate with the people's groups in various villages to lay in ambush and be prepared. When the Japanese and puppet troops had landed halfway, the ambushers rose up together and intercepted them head-on, capturing more than 300 Japanese and puppet troops on the spot and seizing more than 100 guns. This battle was the only victory since the start of the war in Zhongshan, but the captured prisoners were mostly puppet troops, with only a dozen of them being Taiwanese. The prisoners have been dispatched by the Sixth District Command and the county government, along with soldiers, to a certain supreme command for disposal.

### Pinghu Jiashan: Poisonous Atmosphere Pervades, Epidemics Rampant, Many Deaths

Jiashan Correspondence: After the fall of Jiashan, the Japanese and puppet regime, in order to implement a policy of poisoning the people, established so-called "official opium dens" to promote opium sales. The price was much lower than in Shanghai, so general opium addicts flocked to them. The puppet director of the dens, Sun Wenbing, and the head of the Japanese Comfort Corps, Ogata, occupied about half of all the dens. Others, such as Yu Yunmen and Lu Jimin, also invested 1,500 [yuan], more or less. Recently, the head of the Japanese Comfort Corps merged all thirty-one "swallow houses" into five, on a particularly large scale, which shows their rigorous implementation of the poisoning policy. Generally, merchants in Pinghu who trade raw opium, whose shipments were previously obstructed and greatly affected, have now fully recovered. Opium addicts are being registered and ID cards are being issued by the puppet county government, costing between 3 jiao and 2 jiao per card. In Songjiang, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Pinghu areas, epidemics are rampant, and deaths follow one after another. There are also quite a few deaths among the Japanese soldiers, mostly cremated on the spot. Those who have already been coffined have their coffins burned. The residents' previously issued passes are all invalid. Recently, they have been using a "convenience examination certificate," checking feces and urine. If there are no epidemic bacteria, a new pass can be obtained with the certificate, but it is said that the convenience examination certificates will be abolished from October 1st. The epidemic situation in Zhapu is even more serious, and the people held a Wen Yuan Shuai festival in the hope of slightly reducing the epidemic.

### Overseas Fujianese: Enthusiastic Remittances Home; Reached 10 Million Yuan Each in July and August

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the overseas Chinese in Nanyang who make a living have been enthusiastically remitting money back to China, averaging more than 4.5 million yuan per month. However, the months of July and August broke the two-year record, reaching 10 million yuan each. Among them, the Philippines and Singapore were the largest, each about 3 million yuan, followed by Yangon, Surabaya, Java, Penang, Sumatra, San Shimlun, Thailand, and Vietnam. The counties receiving the funds are Jinjiang, Yongchun, Nan'an, Hui'an, Longxi, Fuqing, and other counties, all belonging to the southern Fujian area. It is found that southern Fujian has an annual trade deficit of about 30 million yuan, which is made up for by remittances from overseas Chinese. Since the Japanese warships blockaded the ports in May of this year, imports of goods have almost disappeared, and all imported goods have skyrocketed in price. Fortunately, there are huge amounts of overseas remittances to provide assistance, so social life has not yet experienced a serious panic. However, the number of overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country has been greatly reduced. It is estimated that in July and August, the number of people leaving the country was more than 700 per month, and the number of people returning to the country was 150.

### Current Situation in Wujiang: Prices Soar, Japanese and Puppet Authorities Cause Trouble

Wujiang Correspondence: Wujiang, located on the Sujia Road, is a land of fish and rice. The puppet magistrate Zhu Yuanzhi, recently feeling that the guerrillas in the four townships are strong and his puppet orders cannot be smoothly delivered to the remote countryside, invested in hiring a Jianghu opera troupe to perform in the Cao Wang Temple, praying for peace. Zhu himself went to burn incense and pray, asking the Cao Wang deity to eliminate the guerrillas, which is truly an unthinkable joke. Copper coins have long disappeared in the city of Wujiang, and various substitute coupons are emerging in large numbers, leaving the people at a loss. The price of goods is shockingly high, at least four or five times higher than before. Those who earn four or five yuan a month or earn a thousand wen a day, with several mouths to feed, have difficulty maintaining their lives. In the countryside, there are even more thieves. The weak endure hunger and cold, a family weeping against each other covered with straw mats, while the strong take the risk of becoming bandits. In Tongli Town in the east of the county, a small number of Japanese and puppet troops are stationed, and they strictly inspect the residents. The inspections are especially tight in the streets and teahouses every day. Anyone returning from afar, without a pass or resident certificate, will be made difficult in every way. Residents in the town are in awe and dare not leave the town, otherwise they cannot cross the thunder pool a step.

### Wuxi Self-Defense Corps Kills Three Japanese Soldiers and Destroys Inland Waterway Shipping Association

Wuxi Correspondence: Zhou Hanliang, the captain of the Self-Defense Corps brigade in the western district of this county, led his team on the second of this month to burn down the Japanese military headquarters in the Xie Xin Woolen Mill and killed more than a dozen Japanese soldiers. The day before yesterday afternoon, the captain led five guards from the countryside to the city. At two thirty in the afternoon, they went to the Wuxi branch of the Inland Waterway Civilian Shipping Association, organized by the Japanese military in the Shenhe warehouse of Ronghu Village, three miles outside the North Gate. At that time, eighty or ninety boat owners were reporting their donations. The captain and others bravely rushed into the Japanese office in the crowd and opened fire on the Japanese who were working in the office. The president of the branch, Japanese Takashi Hiroshi (also known as Takashi Ichi), the accountant Nagata (also known as Yakushiji), and the translator Chen Hanliang (from Danyang) were all shot dead. The captain, seeing that the mission was accomplished, ordered the team members to take off the military uniforms worn by the Japanese corpses, destroy the branch, and collect the books and records used, and then calmly return to the countryside to rejoin the team. At that time, nearby Japanese military police, puppet pacification troops, and puppet police agencies heard the news and went to search, but there was no way to capture them.

### U.S. Senate to Debate Neutrality Act Amendment Today; Isolationist General to Broadcast, Supporting Roosevelt's Policy

Washington: The Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman has been forwarded to the Senate Secretariat. The Senate is scheduled to consider it on the second of next month. The Foreign Relations Committee has made public its review opinion, which states that the arms and military supplies embargo provisions contained in the current Neutrality Act must be completely abolished. As long as these provisions exist, the United States will not be able to maintain neutrality. Moreover, current international law stipulates that belligerent countries may purchase all goods from neutral countries, a provision that has long been accepted by belligerent and neutral countries alike. It is incomprehensible that the United States alone refuses to comply. (30th, Havas dispatch)

New York: Smith, a key figure in the Democratic Party (the 1928 presidential candidate, who opposed President Roosevelt's re-election in the 1936 election), delivered a radio address yesterday, enthusiastically supporting the government's position on the issue of amending the current Neutrality Act and abolishing the arms embargo provisions. He said, "The Neutrality Act amendment drafted by the government is the only good way to prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war. It is extremely fair, full of common sense and patriotism. Those who oppose it are simply ignorant of the actual situation." Some say that it would be sufficient to restore the international laws on neutrality, so why start anew? This statement is reasonable, "but who knows that some countries have long ceased to comply with international law, and even if they are restored, what benefit would there be?" As for distinguishing between contraband and non-contraband goods in wartime, several cargo ships of Sweden and Norway, which were not carrying contraband, were also sunk by German submarines. How can one expect Germany to distinguish between the United States' embargoed and non-embargoed goods? The position adopted by Germany can be summed up in one sentence: all goods destined for Britain are contraband. According to this, those in our country who oppose the abolition of the embargo provisions are almost openly declaring, "All ships of our country may as well be sunk." Conversely, those who agree do not want to allow "all ships of our country to be sunk," that's all. (1st, Havas dispatch)

Washington: Republican Senator Bridge, a candidate for the party in next year's election, originally known for advocating isolationism, made a radio address here today, with wording and arguments that tended to agree with President Roosevelt's views. He said, "We have great concern for the events happening abroad. As a free nation living under a democratic system, we cannot but feel disgusted with the likes of Hitler and Stalin, and everything they represent, and we do not want to see the expansion of National Socialism and Communism, and we must especially prevent these ideologies from extending their influence to the American continent, and we will not hesitate to engage in struggle to achieve this goal. However, we have no responsibility for the disturbances in Central Europe and the boundary disputes caused there. Therefore, no American should go to Europe to fight for other countries. I advocate that members of the U.S. Congress must stay in Washington during the European war and quickly amend the current Neutrality Act. Our country's factories should first accept orders from our country's defense agencies and step up the manufacture of aircraft needed by our country. However, the goods ordered by foreign governments should also begin to be manufactured, and once the current Neutrality Act is amended, allowing aircraft to be transported to the belligerent countries, they can be delivered as scheduled. In short, we should pursue a policy of non-interference, while still striving to strengthen our national defense, so that in the event of an emergency, we can go out to fight with powerful strength. As long as the current situation does not change, we will not change our attitude, nor should we change our attitude." (30th, Havas dispatch)

Washington: Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman made a statement yesterday, saying that according to the current Johnson Act, Britain and France cannot obtain loans from the United States, but Germany, because it does not owe war debts, can borrow money in the United States. Political figures here have commented that the U.S. military occupied the Rhineland region of Germany after the last European war, with expenses totaling $508,000,000, which should have been paid by Germany, but has not yet been paid. Pittman did not pay attention to this, but in fact, according to the Johnson Act, Germany is also not allowed to obtain loans from the United States, the situation is exactly the same as Britain and France.

### Pan-American Conference Secret Meeting Passes Declaration of Economic Cooperation; Safety Zone Set Up Around the Americas; Peace Committee Passes U.S. Proposal

Panama City: The Pan-American Conference held a full secret meeting this afternoon and unanimously passed the Declaration of Economic Cooperation of the Pan-American countries, which will be submitted to an open meeting for a vote. The content is divided into ten articles, which are synthesized from twenty-seven proposals, stipulating the establishment of a standing advisory committee, composed of one representative appointed by the governments of the twenty-one American republics, to meet in Washington before November 15 to discuss (1) the consolidation of economic and financial institutions, (2) the maintenance of budget balance, (3) the stability of currency values, (4) the adjustment of industrial activities, (5) the increase of agricultural production, (6) the development of commercial relations. (30th, Havas dispatch)

Panama City: Regarding the issue of setting up a safety zone around the American continent, the Peace Committee of the Pan-American Conference recently passed the "Panama Declaration" draft proposed by the U.S. representative by an overwhelming majority (only Chile has not yet agreed among the twenty-one representatives). The content is to draw a safety zone in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with an average width of 300 miles, starting from the border between the United States and Canada, passing through the Bermuda Islands (British), Cuba, the seas of South American countries, to Cape Horn (at the tip of South America), folding into the Pacific Ocean, and north through the Galapagos Islands, to the border between the United States and Canada. Within this zone, the naval fleets of one or more American countries should be responsible for patrolling, or sharing the work, or jointly doing it, all are acceptable. However, there are difficulties in the patrolling affairs, such as Chile, with its scattered islands and reefs, enough to be a hiding place for German submarines, and it is not easy to monitor. In addition, certain Latin American countries are concerned that the U.S. fleet patrolling their seas, even if it is temporary, may form a kind of right, and that the United States may be drawn into the vortex of the European war. (30th, Havas)

Panama City: The Pan-American Conference continued to hold a full secret meeting today, and unanimously decided not to set a closing date until the work of the Neutrality and Peace Committees is completed. The Neutrality Committee then continued to meet and submitted the proposals on the export of food and non-military supplies put forward by the representatives of Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay for discussion.

### Chiang Wei-kuo Arrives in America from Europe

New York: Chiang Wei-kuo, the second son of General Chiang Kai-shek, 23 years old, arrived here yesterday from Europe aboard the "Amstelsteden" mail ship. Accompanying him were the wife of Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, and one son. The son was accompanied by Chinese Air Force Lieutenant Cai Jun. Both enjoyed diplomatic privileges and were given special treatment by U.S. Customs. He is currently under the protection of New York Consul General Yu Junji. Chinese here hope that Chiang will be able to attend "China Day" at the New York World's Fair on October 10, when Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Hu Shi will give a speech. "China Day" at the World's Fair is initiated by the United Relief Association for Chinese Civilians and 56 other Chinese organizations. Colonel Roosevelt (son of former President Roosevelt) and the mayor of New York will attend the grand event. Yu Junji did not want to disclose Chiang's future plans and strongly opposed publishing the passenger list of the "Amstelsteden." He claimed that Chiang was relatively secretive during the Atlantic crossing. Chiang studied at the Munich Military Academy in Germany and holds the rank of second lieutenant.

### Philippine Chinese Newspapers Issue Announcement to Shan State

Chongqing: Yesterday, five Chinese newspapers in the Philippines published editorials with similar content, believing that the arrest of hundreds of Chinese by Shan State (Siam) is a distressing event. China and Shan State have always had friendly relations, and the Chinese have made many contributions to the economic position of Shan State. The Shan State government should not be provoked by third parties and alienate the relations between China and Shan State. We hope that the Shan government can seriously choose friends. China has always adopted a generous and tolerant policy towards its neighbors, and in recent years, towards Shan State, in addition to taking care of overseas Chinese, there has been no request. At this time when China is resisting aggressors, Shan State should sympathize with China. Now it is adopting a high-pressure policy against overseas Chinese, which is truly unfortunate. (1st, Associated Press dispatch)

Chongqing: According to a group of Chinese merchants who arrived here from Shan State (Siam), the anti-Chinese movements in Shan State are still ongoing. Eight of the nine Chinese newspapers have been banned and stopped publication. Journalists and teachers who participated in patriotic movements have been arrested and imprisoned. Donations from overseas Chinese to help relieve the suffering of Chinese soldiers have been confiscated. The number of hours for teaching Chinese language in schools has been reduced from 27 hours per week to six hours. Chinese businessmen are subject to harsh taxation. The anti-Chinese movement is entirely driven by Japanese propaganda. (1st, Reuters dispatch)

### Ministry of Education Continues to Relieve Social Education Workers by Registering 235 People and Assigning Them to Serve in Various Provinces and Cities in the Interior

(Chongqing Correspondence) Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui have fallen one after another. Due to environmental factors, the social education institutions in the war zones have been unable to advance their work, and the staff have also retreated to the interior one after another. The Ministry of Education believes that these employees are far from their homes and their lives are worrying, and that they all have experience in social education work and should continue to be given work to provide relief and promote wartime private education work. Therefore, it ordered the education departments of Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Henan, and Jiangxi provinces and the Chongqing municipal government to handle the registration. As of now, a total of one thousand one hundred and thirty-five people have registered. In addition to a part of them being organized by the Ministry into two social education work groups, the rest have been assigned to the education departments of various provinces for employment. Currently, the first social education work group has 190 members, the second social education work group has 238 members, 207 have been assigned to the Hunan Provincial Education Department, 324 have been assigned to the Hubei Provincial Education Department, 76 have been assigned to the Henan Provincial Education Department, 77 have been assigned to the Shaanxi Provincial Education Department, 11 have been assigned to the Jiangxi Provincial Education Department, and 40 have been assigned to the Chongqing Municipal Government. Hunan and Hubei provinces will organize social education work groups to carry out wartime social education, while the remaining provinces will assign them to social education institutions to serve or take on administrative work. The living expenses of the registered personnel will be paid monthly by the Ministry of Education.

### Guangxi Medical College Established, Opens on October 1

(Guilin Correspondence) The Guangxi Nanning Military Medical School, originally the Guangxi Provincial Medical College, was established in 1934. Later, in response to military needs, it was changed to the Guangxi Military Medical School in 1937. This year, due to the central government's adjustment and improvement of military health facilities, the Garrison Headquarters decided to transfer the school to the provincial government. The Education Department believes that in order to improve the health of the people, medical and health personnel should be cultivated as much as possible. Therefore, it was decided to change the Military Medical School to the Guangxi Medical College and attach a training class for health technicians. The Nanning Provincial Hospital is also affiliated with the college. The college is scheduled to open on October 1. In the next month, professors will be supplemented and students' levels will be adjusted. As for the current graduating students, they have been transferred to hospitals in Nanning, Baise, and Guilin for internship.

The unprecedentedly grand charity tennis tournament concluded successfully yesterday. Yesterday's program was even more exciting than the first day, so more guests were crowded in. Three velvet balls sold at auction for 500 yuan to Mr. Shao Liangeng. The total revenue for the two days reached a huge 3,731 yuan, all of which was donated to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, benefiting countless starving refugees. The results of yesterday's performance are as follows:

Yesterday's performance focused on the finals of the McCague men's singles and doubles championships. McCague's tennis skills are really above the amateur level, so the game was extremely exciting. In the singles final between Tao Maozi and Cai Houfa, both sides had excellent forehands and backhands, and the serve was very sharp. Cai's work at the net was truly a masterpiece, while Tao excelled in side-spin shots. The McCague men's singles was a best-of-five-sets system, while the doubles final was a best-of-three-sets system.

### Two Victories for Tung Wah and Lido: Tung Wah Wins 3-0 Against French Commerce, Lido Defeats Portuguese 4-1

Yesterday, being Sunday, there were as many as three friendly football matches. In the morning, St. Francis of Yih Yuen was unexpectedly defeated by Tung Sai Lai with a huge score of two to eight. This was followed by Tung Wah versus French Commerce. French Commerce is not what it used to be; many famous players have scattered. Although there are one or two people supporting the remnants, it ultimately feels like a single tree is hard to support. Only the shell remains. Tung Wah won very easily, with the first half ending three to zero, and the final score remaining the same. In the afternoon, Lido played against Portugal at Aurora University. The Portuguese lineup was not much different from when they attended the International Cup last year. Lido ultimately defeated them heavily with a score of four to one, and the only goal scored by Portuguese Commerce was just a penalty kick.

Tung Wah Easily　Defeats French Commerce Yesterday

French Commerce's little blonde haired Robert Stoff was absent yesterday, resulting in only Jem Watt supporting the front line alone. Although the defense consisted of veterans such as Bowser Zhong and Cole, they ultimately lacked coordination, making it difficult to manage, leading to all offensive opportunities belonging to Tung Wah. French Commerce is not what it used to be, having declined drastically since Bowser Hugh returned to his country, Newburg passed away from illness, and Parker retired due to nationality issues. After the start of the match, Dai Lingjing scored a goal within minutes, but it was not counted due to offside. At sixteen minutes, Avanche crossed, and A Dai scored with a header, making it one to zero. At twenty-four minutes, Dai and Jia rushed in together, Jia fell, and Dai succeeded, making it two to zero. At thirty minutes, Youliang cut in, and Yu Qiaxing scored from the crowd with one kick, making it three to zero. The first half ended. After adjusting the lineup in the second half, French Commerce's offensive was slightly better than in the first half, but their shooting was lacking, and nothing came of it. Only Jem Watt's flat shot, which Qin Bigao saved into a corner kick, was relatively exciting. Tung Wah ultimately ended the game with the three to zero lead created in the first half.

Lido Easily　Defeats Portugal

In the match between Lido and Portuguese Commerce, Portuguese Commerce went all out to fight, only missing Massanier, Favan Laugh, and Cora Sha. Portuguese Commerce kicked off and attacked first, with Lopos shooting, going over the crossbar. Lido counterattacked, with Xu Wenkui attacking twice, but both times went wide. Lido was warned again, and escaped safely. At fourteen minutes, Qiu Ting crossed, Kehou chipped the ball, and Su Ruo blocked it, but A Kui rushed up and made the final push, (one to zero). After two minutes, Zhang Lingen fouled, and Su Ruo took the penalty kick twice before succeeding, tying the score. At twenty minutes, Portuguese Commerce's left back committed a handball in the penalty area, another penalty kick, and Xu Wenkui scored with one kick, (two to one). One minute later, Wu Qixiang passed, A Sun chipped the ball, and Xu Wenkui hit the target, (three to one). After halftime, both sides made major changes. Xu Wenkui and Huang Kehou retired together. After the changes in Portuguese Commerce's lineup, their strength decreased. Lido attacked repeatedly, but Sun Jinshun's luck was not good, and all shots hit the post. Jiang Chao missed many good opportunities, but after Li Yichen was transferred to center forward, he succeeded greatly at fifteen minutes. When the final whistle blew, Lido won a great victory with four to one.

### How to Stabilize Wartime Food Supplies

— Chen Hezhang

One lesson learned from the First World War is that the effectiveness of food in wartime is no less than that of artillery fire on the front lines; because during the war, millions of troops must be mobilized, and the supply of food must be as adequate as possible. Otherwise, how can soldiers have the strength to fight a protracted war if they are hungry? On the other hand, food is the most important necessity of life for the people. If there is a shortage of food and everyone is hungry, social unrest will occur, thus hindering military operations. In the previous World War, how elite were the German army, navy, and air force, and how abundant were their military supplies; but behind them, the people felt a lack of food. By 1918, even military food became difficult, resulting in defeat!

From the beginning of this European war to the present, it has not been long, and countries have already begun to control food. Germany has implemented food rationing, and since September 9, a flour allocation system has been implemented, with a limit of five pounds of flour per person per week. The French government has promulgated and implemented wartime civil food relief regulations. The United Kingdom will issue 80 million food crude certificates... Children under the age of six can enjoy half the adult ration (this is a Haidong telegram on the 15th; but according to an Associated Press dispatch on the 9th, the British government will implement food control within three or four weeks. The United Kingdom has a lot of food stored, but salted meat and butter may be temporarily in short supply due to transportation difficulties). As for Italy, which is currently neutral, the Italian government has promulgated wartime economic emergency regulations, regarding food: prohibiting the sale of wine and coffee; limiting each person to one ounce of baked bread per day, and no meat on two days a week; restaurants are limited to one meat and one fish per meal. It can be seen how important food is in wartime.

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese government promulgated the Wartime Food Management Regulations on August 18, 1937, of which Article 4 stipulates management matters: (1) production; (2) consumption; (3) storage; (4) price; (5) transportation and trade; (6) control and distribution. Since the promulgation of this regulation, food transportation and sales agencies have been established in various provinces, cities, and counties, and food warehouses have been widely established in the interior and adjacent war zone areas. For example, the Sichuan Agricultural Capital Bureau and the Sichuan Provincial Bank are currently planning to purchase large quantities of food and establish simple granaries so that farmers can mortgage their rice and grain at high prices. This measure is intended to prevent food shortages for the people on the one hand, and increase farmers' income on the other hand.

There are no statistics on China's food production situation after the war; but according to estimates by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry before the war, the average yield from 1931 to 1935 was: an average of 1,026,011,000 shi dan of rice in 22 provinces across the country over five years; 446,339,000 shi dan of wheat; and 1,089,462,000 shi dan of miscellaneous grains, totaling 2,629,368 shi dan. In terms of percentage, rice accounts for 36 percent; wheat accounts for 17 percent; and miscellaneous grains account for 47 percent. Then, based on the population and food composition of each province and the consumption of each type of food per person per year, the consumption volume is estimated. The calculated supply and demand differences are recorded below: (1) Rice - the national production volume is 1,026,011,000 shi dan, the actual consumption volume is 959,872,000 shi dan, with a surplus of 66,139,000 shi dan. (2) Wheat - the national production volume is 46,339,000 shi dan, the actual consumption volume is 462,435,000 shi dan, with a deficit of 16,096,000 shi dan. (3) Miscellaneous grains - the national production volume is 1,089,462,000 shi dan, the actual consumption volume is 887,912,000 shi dan, with a surplus of 201,550,000 shi dan. According to this statistic, there is still a surplus of 261,593,000 shi dan in the total amount of food; however, the actual consumption volume estimated in this figure only refers to food for human consumption, and does not include livestock feed seeds and other uses.

In fact, the total amount of food consumed in China each year is quite a lot. According to a survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry, of the rice produced in the 22 provinces of the interior, 82 percent is for human consumption, 8 percent is for seeds, 4 percent is for livestock feed, and 6 percent is for other uses. Of the wheat, 74 percent is for human consumption, 11 percent is for seeds, 5 percent is for livestock feed, and 10 percent is for other uses. Other miscellaneous grains have a small percentage for human consumption, and a large percentage for livestock feed and other uses. From this point of view, China's food production cannot supply all aspects of consumption without a surplus, but rather a shortage.

The decline in food production during wartime is a common fact, because the majority of strong men in rural areas are conscripted into the army and absorbed by war industries, the conscription of horses, the consumption of livestock, the conversion of farmland into battlefields, etc., lead to a significant decrease in food production. Looking at the last World War, although the people of the warring countries were very enthusiastic about farming, the area sown did decrease in fact. At the same time, it is also a common fact that food cannot be imported as smoothly as in peacetime during wartime. If it is in a state of blockade, the difficulty of importing is very great. Speaking of China, the main food materials of rice and wheat are more than enough to supply human consumption in peacetime; however, when added to livestock and other uses, there is a shortage. This shortage will naturally be felt even more due to the reduction in wartime production. Therefore, it is imperative to strive to increase food production during wartime. The Outline of the Implementation Measures for Refugee Reclamation promulgated by the Executive Yuan on March 3, 1938, is indeed a concrete measure to increase production. After the war, provinces in the interior such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, and Guangxi have greatly increased the production of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains after the government encouraged the planting of food. This year, due to favorable rainfall and improvements in planting methods, food can be harvested again. Therefore, although China's wartime food supply is felt to be insufficient, it is certainly not as serious as generally imagined. If control policies can be effectively implemented, people will automatically save on consumption, and if necessary, a quantitative distribution will be enforced. There is no shortage of precedents for all of this in various countries. For rice and wheat, which are in greater shortage, in addition to restricting improper consumption, miscellaneous grains should be used as substitutes as much as possible in consumption. It should be known that China has an excess supply of miscellaneous grains and livestock meat and egg products, etc., and there are large exports in peacetime. Wartime export difficulties can regulate surplus and deficiency. In this way, China's wartime food self-sufficiency is very possible.

The biggest reason for China's lack of food is improper consumption, with the consumption of refined white rice and winemaking being the largest.

The Chinese love to eat refined white rice, which not only wastes food, but is also not in line with hygiene. Before the war, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Industrial Products Inspection Institute used chemical analysis methods to inspect brown rice and white rice, and the results showed that the protein and fat content of refined white rice was less than that of brown rice, with the No. 1 Changshu white rice being the least. However, Shanghai people like to eat Changshu No. 1 white glutinous rice the most, and there are still many people who buy No. 1 white glutinous rice for 40 yuan. Regarding the loss of milling brown rice into refined white rice, according to statistics from the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry, each stone loses two dou four sheng six he (in fact, each stone of milled No. 1 white glutinous rice loses three dou), which is equal to 40% of the consumption of refined white rice. Now, assuming that the annual consumption of refined white rice is 100 million shi, the loss of food rice calculated at two dou five sheng per shi is 25 million shi, which can be used as food for eight or nine million people for one year. Such a huge loss is really uneconomical. Someone estimates that 5% or 6% of domestic rice and wheat are used for winemaking, and the quantity is more than 30 million shi; 15% of barley is used for brewing. Someone else estimates that the annual consumption of grains for winemaking is about 60 million shi; the annual consumption of wheat and barley for winemaking is 10 million shi; and 23% of sorghum production is used for winemaking. As for sugar production and feed, there are no statistics yet. Just looking at the existing numbers, it can be seen that China's food waste is simply appalling. In view of this, the Chinese government has repeatedly ordered local authorities in various provinces to restrict the brewing of wine from major food crops. But on the other hand, it also requires the people of the whole country to appeal to moral self-discipline, eat brown rice as much as possible, use miscellaneous grains as substitutes, and avoid all unnecessary consumption of food.

In addition, under the principle of control, at least one point of preventing speculation must be effectively achieved. During wartime, commodity prices fluctuate too much, which often leads to general speculative behavior; because of this speculative behavior, it stimulates a kind of untrue supply and demand situation, making commodity price fluctuations even more chaotic. To stabilize commodity prices and make supply and demand correspond, it is necessary to prevent speculative behavior and eliminate the untrue supply and demand phenomenon in the market. The so-called speculative behavior does not only refer to speculation in the exchange, such as individuals storing food beyond their own needs, and food merchants engaging in activities that exceed market needs, including speculation.

At present, this kind of speculative phenomenon is most obvious in Shanghai. Not to mention other commodity prices, just look at the price of rice, which has risen to such a degree that people are living in dire straits! In the present situation where the Chinese government's whip is beyond its reach, it is not an easy task to stabilize commodity prices and make supply and demand correspond. At this juncture, we can only hope that the concession authorities will do their best to curb the continued rise in commodity prices on the one hand, and try to find ways to dredge up sources on the other hand. As for the speculators themselves, they should be aware of the suffering of the masses, and should never take the opportunity to seek personal gain because of the urgent needs of others, which is the so-called immoral "war profiteering." The citizens themselves must have a spirit of solidarity and mutual cooperation. During the previous World War, as the prices of war-time bread and other foodstuffs gradually rose in France and the people's lives became increasingly difficult, consumer cooperatives were established in various places to supply bread and other foodstuffs at low prices. This is a precedent that can be emulated. Citizens may wish to organize neighborhood consumer cooperatives with each alley as a unit to sell daily necessities at low prices. Please give guidance from the authorities on the methods of organization, etc. At the same time, citizens should save as much as possible. The London War Economy Committee in the United Kingdom distributed the following leaflets to various restaurants during the previous World War: "Do not waste bread. If half a slice is enough, cut the whole slice into thin slices to eat. It is the duty of the people to work together to save bread." At this time, citizens should carefully consider these words!

### China's Transportation Construction (Continued)

— Tang Xiaoyun

First, let's talk about the highways in the northwestern provinces: the highways completed in Shaanxi and Xinjiang provinces are no less than several thousand kilometers; such as the highway from Kulun through Yamatai, Huo Dassen, Shabuke, Nandian, and into Ningxia Province, from Ningxia through Weiyuan and further south to Jiuquan, Gansu Province: it has long been completed. The Suixin Highway from Suiyuan through Mongolia to Xinjiang has also been opened to traffic.

As for the highway construction in the southwestern provinces, it is more developed than in the northwest. According to a survey, the total length of the highways that have been completed in the southwestern provinces is more than 27,000 kilometers. There are also more than 20,000 kilometers under active construction and planning. The trunk lines connecting the provinces include: Gan-Dian, Chuan-Gui, Gui-Min, Xiang-Gui, Chuan-Xiang, Chuan-Dian, Xiang-E, Gui-Dian, Chuan-E, Xiang-Qian, Dian-Qian, and Chuan-Qian. In addition, each province also has construction plans for its own provincial highway system. Taking Guizhou Province as an example: the province is currently rushing to build the following ten trunk roads: (1) Chi-Wei section of the Chuan-Dian Road (recently opened to traffic), (2) Xing-Ren Road (from Xingren and Xingyi to Kunming), (3) An-Du Road (from Anlong through Baise, Guangxi to Longzhou). The above are the highways connecting the province to neighboring provinces. As for the highways between counties, there are: (4) Yu-Song Road, (5) Ding-Luo Road, (6) Du-San Road, (7) Zun-Ping Road, (8) Zun-Song Road, (9) Sui-Rong Road, (10) Tong-Chi Road, etc.

In Yunnan, the highways planned to be built this year include: (1) Xuan-Zhao section (from Yiwei through Guizhou, Weining, and reaching Zhaotong, Sichuan), with a length of 295 kilometers. The Yiwei to Dian-Qian section has been completed. (2) Lu-Kai section (from Lunan to Kaiyuan) This section was completed in July. (3) Kai-Bo section (Kaiyuan to Boai via Yanshan) with a total length of 490 kilometers and 100 meters. The Kaiyuan to Yanshan section was completed in July. (4) Kai-Jie section (Kaiyuan to Jiejiu, 78 kilometers long), this section was opened to traffic in March. In addition, there are: (1) E-Xin section (Eshan to Xinping) 184 kilometers long. (2) Xin-Ning section (Xinping to Ning'er) 359 kilometers and 240 meters long. (3) Da-Li section (Dali to Lijiang) 180 kilometers and 6 meters long. (4) Wu-Yuan section (Wuding to Yuanmou), etc., are all under active construction. The highways between counties in the province that will soon be completed are: (1) Kunming to Fumin, (2) Xiangyun to Binchuan, (3) Binchuan to Yongsheng, etc. There are also: Guangfu, Guangbo, Yuxi, Heshi, Tonghai, Jiangchuan, Hua-Ning, etc., which are under planning and construction.

The government has now allocated 76 million yuan for improvement costs in order to increase the efficiency of highway traffic; of which 52 million yuan will be used to purchase new trucks, and 13 million yuan will be used to improve road surfaces. Under the government's construction and improvement of highways at any cost, the highway transportation capacity in the future will inevitably develop and strengthen day by day, which is beyond doubt.

C Aviation Before the war, China's airline routes included six major trunk lines, such as Shanghai-Hankou, Shanghai-Ping, Shanghai-Guangzhou, Beijing-Shaanxi, Ping-Han, and Beijing-Yunnan; because they were all located along the coast and the Yangtze River ports, they were suspended after the outbreak of the war. Later, with the active promotion and assistance of the government, three major airlines, "China," "Eurasia," and "Southwest," have built (1) the Yu-Rong Line, which is 290 kilometers long; (2) the Yu-Kun Line, which is 788 kilometers long; (3) the Yu-Jia Line, which is 200 kilometers long; (4) the Chongqing-Hami Line, which is 2,700 kilometers long; (this line was officially opened to traffic in March), (5) the Shaan-Rong Line, which is 600 kilometers long; (6) the Rong-Kun Line, which is 700 kilometers long; (7) the Guangzhou Line, which is 406 kilometers long; (8) the Guangzhou-Yong Line, which is 551 kilometers long in total.

D Telecommunications In addition to the government's active construction of water, land, and air transportation, it is also making every effort to build wired and wireless telephone and telegraph networks in the country. Such as establishing a telegraph headquarters, expanding existing telegraph lines: increasing telephone lines, building telephone and telegraph communication networks in the southwest and northwest; and building wireless telegraph machine communication networks, increasing international direct wireless telegraph and telephone circuits. And build small wireless radio stations in important cities in various border provinces and in the Kunming-connected provinces, etc. Taking Guizhou Province as an example, long-distance thunder phones have been installed in 52 counties; the 29 counties that have not been installed will set up small wireless radio stations in the short-term counties, and long-distance telephones with various counties. It is estimated that the copper wire used in the province's telecommunications in the year of the Anti-Japanese War is equal to the copper wire used in the past 20 years. The rapid progress of telecommunications in the border provinces can be seen from this.

Conclusion

Because of the extensive development of transportation construction in the southwest and northwest, it can not only enable the smooth progress of China's economic, political, cultural, and other undertakings; but also make it easier to quickly concentrate forces in the military. The expansion of international transportation lines can break through the blockade and obtain more material and technical assistance from friendly countries. (The End)

Commercial News

### Finance: Cash Off-Site Trading - Still Mediocre

Yesterday's dark market situation of cash foreign exchange was due to the weekly holiday, resulting in no formal market conditions. It is rumored that the off-site situation was still mediocre, and the trend was first firm and then tired. At the beginning, a transaction was made at 4,115 yuan, but later it became tired due to the sale of spot numbers and floating multiples. It once fell back to a low of 4,100 yuan, but at noon, a certain money exchange business still asked for 4,110 yuan for the selling price, and still returned 4,100 yuan for the buying price, with no great honor or disgrace compared to the last off-site price of the previous day. The selling price of gold bars in silver shops remained unchanged throughout, with both Datong Bank and Xintong Bank still hanging at 415 yuan, and the buying price was reduced by about 20 yuan. As for the London telegram on the 10th and 20th, the price of British pure gold was still set at 8 pounds and 8 shillings per ounce. No telegrams arrived for British, American, and Indian foreign silver.

### Grain Prices: Broken Japonica Rice Increases by Another Dollar; Top-Grade Regular Japonica Opens at Forty-Four Dollars; Sales of Newly Harvested Yanglu Pointed Rice Flourish in the Market

Yesterday, the supply from various trading groups and river ports was coming to an end, and no shipments had arrived. Furthermore, the volume of new goods transported by rail from Kunshan, Suzhou, Fengxian, and Jiading was also sluggish, amounting to only about three thousand packages. With the scarcity of arrivals, the market sentiment remained stable. Moreover, as sales continued to be active in both urban and rural markets, the market remained firm. Prices for top-grade rice did not fluctuate, with all quotations following the original levels. Jiangbei new top-grade rice remained at twenty-three dollars, followed by twenty-two dollars. Wuhu top-grade rice was priced at twenty-three dollars and eighty cents and twenty-three dollars. Bangbu top-grade rice ranged from twenty-three dollars to twenty-one dollars and seventy cents. As for newly harvested Yanglu top-grade rice, due to its limited supply and popularity among stores, its quality was similar to that of Japonica rice. With the recent high price of Japonica rice, many consumers turned to this top-grade rice, making it a hot-selling item for stores, resulting in competitive purchasing and a market increase of about fifty cents. The quotations for newly harvested Yanglu top-grade rice from Kunshan, Suzhou, Fengxian, and Jiading were twenty-six dollars and fifty cents for the best quality, followed by twenty-five dollars and fifty cents. New Lu top-grade rice was priced at twenty-seven dollars and twenty cents, followed by twenty-six dollars. The prices of Japonica rice became even more attractive, increasing by about one dollar. Top-grade regular broken Japonica rice was priced at forty-three to forty-four dollars, medium quality at forty-one dollars, and top-grade Xixi broken rice at forty-two to forty-three dollars, medium quality at forty-one dollars and forty dollars. Broken Japonica rice from Suzhou, Tongzhou, and Kunshan ranged from forty-one dollars to forty dollars, new Japonica rice at thirty-nine dollars and thirty-eight dollars and fifty cents, Fengjing Baige at forty dollars, and early broken original packages at forty-one to forty-two dollars. Transformed rice also saw an increase, opening at thirty-four to thirty-five dollars, with over seven thousand packages traded.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Slightly Tight

Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's quotation was slightly tighter, with a rebound of thirty to fifty cents. Spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar were fifty-five dollars, re-export sugar at forty-two dollars, Taikoo granulated white B mark at fifty-eight dollars and seventy cents to fifty-nine dollars, CW mark at fifty-eight dollars and fifty cents, CX mark at fifty-eight dollars, DY mark at fifty-seven dollars and fifty cents, HX mark at fifty-seven dollars, H mark coarse red sugar at forty-three dollars and fifty cents, Dutch red sugar at forty-four dollars and fifty cents, and re-export at thirty-seven dollars. Local refined white sugar Zhenji No. 1 was fifty-six dollars, No. 2 at fifty-five dollars and fifty cents, No. 3 at fifty-five dollars, No. 4 at fifty-four dollars and fifty cents. Local No. 1 rock sugar was sixty-six dollars and fifty cents, Jingming rock sugar at fifty-eight dollars. There were a few transactions of domestically produced miscellaneous raw sugar at off-the-record prices, with little change in quoted prices compared to the previous day. It is expected that sales have not been strong recently and that larger sales will occur after the arrival of refined sugar.

### Coal: Coal Dust Arrives; Coal Balls Reduced by Two Dollars; Door-to-Door Sales at Four Dollars per Load

The coal ball business had previously seen manufacturers hoarding raw materials due to concerns about shortages, leading to speculative off-the-record price increases. However, with the recent steady arrival of coal dust, market sentiment has stabilized, and sales have become sluggish. Major manufacturers with larger shipments have also shown signs of competition, resulting in lower domestic prices. A major manufacturer recently offered a price of only seventy-two dollars per ton, but after mediation between the two parties, a price of seventy-four dollars per ton was agreed upon for delivery, with an additional two dollars and fifty cents for transportation, which is two dollars lower than the previous week. Retail sales from door-to-door are ten dollars per basket and four dollars per load (one hundred market catties).

### North-South Goods: Arrival of Orchid Seeds in Shanghai Awaits

The orchid seed production season has long begun, but due to disrupted transportation between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu, no shipments have arrived in Shanghai. Although transportation has now resumed, a certain party mistakenly believes that the goods are medicinal materials and intends to purchase them, which has not yet been resolved. Therefore, the shipment to Shanghai is still pending, and a large shipment may be loaded within this week.

The above diagram compares the potential wartime supply of important raw materials for the seven major powers: the United States, Germany, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan. The "Potential Wartime Increase in Production" includes the supply from territories and the use of substitutes. This diagram was investigated by the International Research Department of Harvard University in the United States and published in Mr. Ainam's book "The Strategy of Raw Materials." The most obvious fact in the diagram is that the United States and the Soviet Union have the most widespread and abundant supply capacity, while Britain and France have the support of their colonies. Japan's poor resource capacity is most tragic, which is undoubtedly a fatal flaw in its war against China.

### Motley Crew Appears; Situation in Western Shanghai Becomes More Chaotic; Residents Relocate to Leave This Unsafe Land; Puppet Officials Attempt to Collect Stall Fees Yesterday

In the area of the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads, the intrusion of puppet police has greatly damaged the police authority of the concessions. Due to the complexity of the situation in the area, the situation has become increasingly chaotic until yesterday. In the Caojiadu and Bailinan Road areas, in addition to the puppet police, there are also armed forces of various origins active. A so-called "Shanghai Special City Western Shanghai Caojiadu Self-Defense Corps" has occupied school buildings, openly set up posts, and the puppet police began collecting taxes in the area yesterday. The general residents, filled with fear, have mostly relocated to safer places, resulting in a sharp increase in vacant houses. The following is a record of the situation:

Certain Bandits Take the Opportunity to Become Active

The members of a certain organization entrenched in the former Cao Yi Elementary School were once disarmed by Italian troops. After being released, although they still stayed in the building, they usually kept the main gate tightly closed and entered and exited through the back door, without making any noise, until now. Recently, as the situation in western Shanghai has gradually changed, they have become active again. The long-closed main gate has been reopened. They all wear grass-green shorts, with inconsistent upper garments. They all carry pistols or Mauser pistols around their waists, moving in and out frequently in groups of twos and threes. The puppet police and patrolmen no longer interfere with them. In addition, there are also "hoodlums" wearing Western suits, also carrying weapons around their waists, scattered on various roads, often appearing in gambling dens and opium dens. The residents in the area are very afraid of their actions.

Japanese Puppets Imitate; Organize Self-Defense Corps

At the same time, the former Cao Nan Elementary School at 93 Lusuezhai Road, Bailinan Road, was suddenly occupied yesterday morning by the so-called "Shanghai Special City Western Shanghai Caojiadu Self-Defense Corps," which hung up a wooden sign and sent out "corps members" to set up posts and guard. It is said that they are supported by the Japanese puppets and have obtained full armament, so they began to operate. The leader is named Hu Deshan, and the entire "corps" has about one hundred members, mostly unemployed vagrants. The uniforms they wear are grass-green, with cloth leggings, black cloth shoes, and military caps, with a five-pointed star-shaped cap badge with five colors of red, yellow, blue, white, and black in the center, and cloth shoulder straps with black numerals. All the "corps members" are issued rifles by the Japanese puppets and claim that they are implementing "self-defense" because the concessions are unable to protect the residents of Caojiadu. In addition, some party members are stationed in a part of the Gan Gong Elementary School at 121 Bailinan Road, also with weapons. Their uniforms are grass-yellow, with round military caps, with a white sun in a blue sky emblem in the center, clearly different from the so-called "self-defense corps members."

Forced Taxation; Residents Relocate One After Another

Residents and merchants in the extra-settlement roads area have been paying taxes to the Municipal Council. However, the puppet authorities recently notified the residents that starting from October 1, taxes must be collected by the puppet "Finance Bureau." Although the Municipal Council has not yet made any statement on this, the puppet authorities began to forcibly collect general taxes in the area starting yesterday. Yesterday morning, at the time of the morning market, two plainclothes puppet officials, together with two armed puppet police, went to the vegetable stalls in the small vegetable market behind Qianjianong, Yuyuan Road, and forced them to pay the signboard tax, ranging from twenty cents to several dimes per person. The residents of the area have been deeply disturbed recently and have relocated one after another, so that houses that used to be difficult to rent at high prices in the Yuyuan Road area are now being offered by landlords at the lowest prices, but no one cares. Rent notices are posted all over the alley entrances and on various utility poles, which is a rare phenomenon since the Shanghai war. As for the detectives of the police station, whether patrolling or setting up posts, they must be in groups of three or five to prevent attacks by thugs. The change in the situation can be seen from this.

Zhaofeng Village Still Relatively Quiet

Since the "Da Dao Police" entered the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads to patrol and set up posts, many days have passed. The Municipal Council has not yet taken any appropriate measures to deal with it, but only notified the police officers stationed in the area to pay attention. Fortunately, no accidents have occurred in the past few days. Yuyuan Road and Jessfield Road are the thoroughfares to Caojiadu, and pedestrians are still bustling, no less than before. Even the tourists in Zhaofeng Park are still endless, enjoying the autumn scenery. The residents of Zhaofeng Village next to it are also living in peace as usual.

Puppet Police Express Being Forced to Do This

Although the Western Shanghai area has been invaded and stationed by puppet police, the detectives of the concession police station are still stationed and patrolling as usual. In some sections, the number of personnel has even been increased to strengthen the force. If any incidents hindering the peace occur in these areas, the police station will still exercise police authority as usual, and the puppet police on duty will not interfere. However, enforcement has become difficult in some sections. A reporter from Da Guang News Agency spoke with the puppet police yesterday and was told that most of them were soldiers captured in battle or police officers from the former Public Security Bureau, who were forced to do this against their will. As for treatment, they only receive a salary of sixteen dollars per month, with self-provided meals. Not only is life painful, but they are also mentally disturbed. They feel ashamed to be stationed here and can only endure humiliation due to circumstances. Their words seemed to be filled with emotion.

Western Newspapers Report Puppet Government's Attempt

The North China Daily News reported that yesterday (30th), it was heard from responsible parties that the Jiangwan Shanghai Special City Government will start today (1st) to collect "municipal donations" from Chinese and foreign residents in the outer roads of the Western District, because the new municipal government recognizes the outer roads of the Western District as part of the Chinese territory. Officials of the Finance Bureau of the new municipal government recently confirmed the Chinese rumors that the new municipal government will take this action, and explained that foreigners residing in the area must also pay taxes, and that the taxes collected are only for winter municipal donations. These words indicate that they will also collect donations for another quarter of this year. It was also announced that the "municipal donation" is 11% of the rent for shops and 9% for residents.

### Japanese Side Sets Up Department to Handle; Central China Police Affairs; Manage Police Affairs of Consulates in Yangtze River Basin

The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, citing the increasing number of people migrating to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the increasing complexity of police affairs at Japanese consulates, established the "Central China Police Department of the Japanese Embassy in China" in Shanghai yesterday to guide and supervise Japanese consulates and police stations in the lower Yangtze River and nearby areas. Embassy Councilor Miura Yoshiaki will serve as the director, and the department will be divided into three sections. The first section will be headed by Consul Hattori Tsuneo, in charge of personnel and police system matters. The second section will be headed by Consul Ogawa Kiichi, in charge of ideology, labor, social movements, publishing, communications, meetings, elections, religion, education, and other matters. The third section will be headed concurrently by Hattori Tsuneo, in charge of judicial affairs, business, transportation, customs, hygiene, coastal defense, household registration, investigation, and supervision of residents.

### US Fleet Commander; Hottle to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow; Will Stay in Shanghai for Several Days; To Maintain Contact with Relevant Authorities

The US flagship Augusta, which has been patrolling the North China Sea for more than a month, is scheduled to sail to Shanghai from Qingdao tomorrow. US Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hottle will also return to Shanghai on the flagship. Hottle's personal yacht Isabel will also return to Shanghai with him. Hottle will stay in Shanghai for several days to maintain contact with relevant authorities. It is rumored that the Shanghai Defense Vehicle Small Group will hold another meeting to discuss proposals, and it is possible that Hottle will advise on the proposals discussed by the group. The US Asiatic Fleet Marblehead is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 4th and sail north for routine patrol work after the Augusta arrives in Shanghai.

### Nishio and Itagaki Arrive in Shanghai; Hold Meetings for Days to Discuss Aggression Plans; Chinese Side Prepares to Deal a Severe Blow

General Nishio, the newly appointed commander-in-chief of Central China by the Japanese authorities, and General Itagaki, the former Minister of the Army who was reassigned as the chief of staff of the Central China Command, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of September 29, one after the other. However, Japanese newspapers have kept this news secret and have not disclosed it, intending to prevent the Chinese side from paying attention and making more resolute preparations for military resistance. Details have been obtained from a certain related party as follows:

Nishio and Itagaki Arrive in Shanghai on the Same Day

After General Nishio officially accepted the new position as commander-in-chief of Central China from the Japanese government, he took a special round trip on the Nagasaki Maru of the Nisshin Company from Japan and arrived in Shanghai at 4:45 p.m. on September 29. The ship docked at the Osaka Wharf in Hongkou. After Nishio disembarked, he took a pre-arranged car under the strict guard of the Japanese naval and military police directly to General Itagaki, the commander of the Japanese army on Disui Road. General Itagaki also arrived at the Shanghai Dachang Airport by plane from Japan at 2:30 p.m. on the same afternoon and, under the protection of the Japanese army, took a car directly to the Japanese military attaché's residence to rest, and then met with Nishio. That evening, they went to a banquet held by the Japanese and puppet sides.

Heavy Guard; Japanese Puppets Welcome

After the Shanghai Japanese organization received a telegram from Tokyo on the morning of September 29 from the Japanese Consulate and the Japanese Army Command, informing them of the date and time of the arrival of Generals Nishio and Itagaki, they, together with the Japanese naval, army, and military police stationed in Shanghai, were deployed around the Osaka Wharf in Hongkou, prohibiting passing pedestrians and taking extremely strict precautions. From the wharf to the Japanese Army Command, Japanese troops were secretly deployed along the way. In addition to the Japanese consul and representatives of the Japanese navy, army, and military police, those who went to the wharf to welcome them included the puppet "mayor" Chuan Xiao'an, the puppet police chief Lu Ying, representatives of a certain faction, Yi Zanren and Chen Nongfu, as well as representatives of the Fuyi Association and the Damin Association.

Major Battles Will Soon Break Out on All Fronts Between China and Japan

Regarding the arrival of Nishio and Itagaki in Shanghai, Japanese newspapers in Shanghai have kept this news secret and have not disclosed it, intending to prevent the Chinese side from paying attention and making more resolute preparations for military resistance. This is especially worthy of the Chinese people's attention. According to unofficial sources, Nishio and Itagaki have been secretly meeting with Japanese officials in Shanghai for days. As soon as an important decision is made, they will rush to inspect the front lines and will soon supervise the army to launch a major war against the Chinese army, as a final struggle. According to reports, the reason for the major war is that China has no hope for peace with Japan and still holds the belief of resisting to the end.

Nishio Leaves Shanghai; Flies to Nanjing

The North China Daily News reported that General Nishio, the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in China, and his chief of staff, Itagaki, the former Japanese Minister of the Army, arrived in Shanghai one after the other on Friday afternoon. They stayed in the city center overnight and left Shanghai at 12:30 p.m. yesterday (30th) and flew to Nanjing.

### Yanagawa Makes a Speech; Induces Economic Cooperation; Says Japan Does Not Want to Control Economic Hegemony; But Chinese Have No Desire to Cooperate

The North China Daily News reported that Lieutenant General Yanagawa, the Director-General of the Japanese Asia Development Board, recently stated at a reception for newspaper reporters at the Central China Liaison Office of the Board that Japan would not refuse people from third countries to participate in Japanese enterprises in China, and that Chinese people participating in Japanese enterprises would also be welcomed. Some Chinese capitalists in the Japanese-occupied areas still do not want to cooperate with the Japanese, and also refuse to negotiate with those who seek

This Kind of Cooperation

and discuss it with them. However, as peace and order in the occupied areas are being rapidly restored, they should consider the welfare of the Chinese people and help the revival of various industries. Some views believe that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is Japan's attempt to control

Economic Hegemony

However, Japan not only has no such intention, but also welcomes the return of Chinese capital to Japanese-occupied areas. Japan will also not refuse people from third countries to participate in Japanese enterprises. The establishment of the Japanese Army Command in China and the establishment of a new central government by Wang Jingwei will not

Affect Existing Plans

of the Asia Development Board. According to reports, Lieutenant General Yanagawa is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Xiamen by ship at 9:00 a.m. today. According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, Yanagawa visited the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, Vice Admiral Oikawa, in Shanghai, and also sent representatives to visit the heads of the Shanghai Special City Government and officers of the Japanese Defense Force.

### Although the Japanese Shipping Company is Established; It is Meaningless; Attempts to Manipulate East Asian Shipping; Japanese Companies Are All Superficially Compliant

Taking advantage of the opportunity of the European war, the Japanese government attempted to complete the manipulation of all shipping on the so-called "East Asian" seas. After exerting great pressure on major Japanese shipping companies, the "East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd." was created, which was officially announced yesterday at the original site of the former Japanese Nisshin Company at 20 Guangdong Road. Details are as follows:

Merger Process

The Japanese government in Tokyo issued an order for implementation of the merger on the first day of last month to reorganize major Japanese shipping companies. The companies that received this order at that time included Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK), Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, Yamashita Kisen, and Dalian Kisen. Nisshin Kisen was the first to express its obedience. Later, Osaka Shosen also joined after Nisshin Kisen. However, NYK, due to its global routes, and Yamashita Kisen, due to its tramp steamers, and Dalian Kisen, citing its specialized service to Dalian in North China, were slow to agree to cooperate. After repeated negotiations between the Japanese government and the companies, NYK finally agreed to partially cede several ships between China and Japan to participate. The global routes still retained the NYK name and were independent in nature. Yamashita Kisen fully accepted, while Dalian Kisen did not join for the time being. Therefore, the so-called "East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd." was formed by integrating Nisshin Kisen, Osaka Shosen, Yamashita Kisen, and part of NYK.

Shipping Routes and Vessels

According to investigations, the shipping routes and vessels of each company participating in the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. are as follows: NYK is participating with five vessels, including the passenger ships Nagasaki Maru and Shanghai Maru between Nagasaki and Shanghai, and the cargo ships Myoken Maru, Myogi Maru, and Myosei Maru. Nisshin Kisen is participating with about 20 vessels, including all of its Yangtze River routes, such as the Daikichi Maru, Kayang Maru, and Anxing Maru (formerly newspaper merchant ships). Osaka Shosen is participating with the Fujian Maru and Changsha Maru on the Sino-Japanese route, as well as several ships on the South China route. Yamashita Kisen is entirely tramp steamers, numbering up to ten, but its routes also extend to the South Seas Islands. Therefore, the East Asian shipping lines that the Japanese government plans to manipulate include the Sino-Japanese line, the South China line, the Yangtze River line, and the South Seas line. The North China line has not yet been successfully joined. According to general observations, although its ambitions are high, it is difficult to achieve its intended purpose due to the lack of ships. As for the person who controls the East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd., it is still Mr. Katsuto (transliteration), the general manager of Nisshin Kisen.

### Residents North of Suzhou Creek; Suffer Unbearable Harassment; Household Registration Survey Scheduled to Begin on the 11th; Forced Inoculations; Residence Used as a Threat

In District A, north of Suzhou Creek, the Japanese side has been forcing local residents to get vaccinations. The deadline was originally set for the end of last month, but because many people refused to get vaccinated, the Japanese side had no choice but to extend the vaccination period. Details are as follows:

Refusal to Get Vaccinated; Extension Announced

The vaccination site set up by the Japanese side in a tent next to the Shanghai Electric Power Company on the side of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, under the name of the "3rd Group of the Shanbei Luren Hospital Mobile Team," was re-posted yesterday with a notice announcing that the vaccination period would be extended for ten days, until October 10. Therefore, the forced vaccination work continued in the tent yesterday morning. After the Huisi Police Station sent Chinese and Western police to maintain order, the situation completely changed, and the previous chaotic scene was swept away.

Threatening Language in the Notice

According to a resident in the area who spoke to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Japanese side has also extended the deadline for the household registration survey in the area to begin on the 11th of this month. At that time, residents must present a vaccination certificate and then exchange for a pass before they are allowed to reside in the area. It was also found that the so-called "Luren Hospital" issued a notice containing serious language such as "If you do not get vaccinated by the deadline, you will be absolutely prohibited from passing through the North Henan Road and Haining Road area."

Residents Uneasy; Relocations Frequent

In view of the above situation, the Japanese side will impose various inconveniences and restrictions on residents in the area. However, it is unclear whether the restricted areas are only the North Henan Road and Haining Road area or include other side roads east of North Henan Road. As a result, the residents in the area have been quite uneasy, and many have relocated to the north of North Henan Road or south of Suzhou Creek. The rental notices posted in various alleys in the area are particularly numerous.

Defense Situation in Various Sections of District A

Since the Japanese side took over the defense of the area, there are still sentries stationed at the southern entrances of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road. At the two blocked gaps in North Jiangxi Road, Haining Road, and Wenshi Road, there are two Japanese soldiers stationed at each post. Those passing through the gaps must show their passes. The North Henan Road area is generally guarded by British troops, and the police officers of the Huisi Police Station also patrol as usual.

The Inside of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is Extremely Filthy

Since the "Da Dao Municipal Government" occupied the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at the north end of Tianhougong Bridge, its corridors and courtyards have become extremely filthy. The so-called "Da Dao Police" are stationed in the outhouses under the corridors, occupying a small team in total. They have all been disarmed, and the unarmed police guarding the entrance and the "issuing passes" office are their accomplices and have not been recently transferred from outside.

### Rumors of the Puppet Government Taking Over the Courts; Recurrence; The Attitude of the Diplomatic Corps Remains the Same; Firmly Refusing the Request

The Continental News reported that rumors that the Nanjing puppet "Reformed Government" will soon take over the Chinese courts in Shanghai resurfaced last night (30th). A message from the Japanese side said that, according to "well-informed sources," the two courts will be headed by a former chief judge who was recently dismissed by the National Government. In addition to the chief judge, officials of the puppet regime have already selected "qualified" candidates to fill various positions. A sub-headquarters of the "Ministry of Justice" has been established in Hongkou to be responsible for the takeover of the courts. Regarding the special zone courts, the puppet government has repeatedly made requests to the consular corps here, but they have all been rejected. Last spring, when rumors spread that the puppet "municipal government" would use force to take over the courts, the British defense forces stationed in Shanghai added armed guards to all the buildings of the courts.

### Passengers with Tickets for the Deping Cannot Board the Ship

Since the plan to shorten the voyage of the Shanghai-Ningbo line failed to materialize, the Moufu ship stopped taking time off to return to Shanghai, so passengers switched to purchasing tickets for the Deping ship. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Zhenhai on the 29th, but due to the time required for loading cargo, it was changed to 4:00 p.m. on the 30th. However, when it was about to depart, it was discovered that some passengers who had not purchased tickets had boarded the ship without permission and insisted on traveling. However, hundreds of passengers who had purchased tickets were unable to board the ship due to extreme crowding. Although the shipping company sent people to persuade the passengers who had boarded without tickets, it was unsuccessful. Therefore, the ship left yesterday morning, but many passengers who had purchased tickets were left stranded on the shore, in a miserable situation.

### Number of Relief Provided by Charity Groups; Restricted

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's supply of relief to various charity groups has recently seen greatly increased expenditures due to rising prices. In addition to continuing to solicit donations to maintain operations, it has also restricted the maximum number of people provided with relief by each charity group as follows: (1) Cilian General Association 17,930 people, (2) China Relief Association for Women and Children 629 people, (3) Cilian Branch Association 8,661 people, (4) International Relief Association 3,773 people, (5) Five Counties Association 310 people, (6) Zhi Sheng Shan Yuan 150 people, (7) Baoshan Association 112 people, (8) Citizens' Association 95 people, (9) Chinese Child Welfare Association 418 people, (10) Chinese Leprosy Relief Association 31 people, (11) Refugee Children's Middle School 170 people. The remaining refugee maternity hospitals and the first and second shelters are not restricted for the time being.

### Strict Inland Prevention of the Export of Legal Tender: Attempting to Buy Foreign Exchange in Shanghai; Promulgation of Laws Forbidding Smuggling; Inspection of Aircraft Carrying Items

In order to prevent the unnecessary outflow of legal tender, the Ministry of Finance has, in addition to strictly restricting remittances of foreign exchange from the mainland, promulgated laws prohibiting the export of legal tender, with the aim of preventing the smuggling of legal tender out of the country to purchase foreign exchange in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and other places. The following specific measures are now prescribed, telegraphed to all provinces for earnest and strict inspection and suppression: (1) Regardless of any public or private institution, the transport of all items out of the country by commercial aircraft must first obtain approval and a certificate from the Military Affairs Commission before being allowed to proceed, and the inspection authorities shall be responsible for inspection; (2) Passengers' luggage on aircraft and passengers' luggage and packages on vehicles shall, except for diplomatic personnel of friendly nations who shall be handled in accordance with international practice, be subject to inspection by the inspection authorities; (3) All items carried by airlines, motor transport agencies, and other personnel shall be handled in accordance with the above; (4) The entrances, exits, and passages of aircraft and vehicles shall be strictly designed by the inspection authorities to eliminate the abuses of bypassing and passing items; (5) The existing laws and regulations restricting the carrying of banknotes and the transportation of items that do not conflict with these measures shall remain in effect.

### Shanghai Market Raises Funds for Winter Clothing for the National Army: 200,000 Yuan in Lieu; Total Solicitation of Three Million Cotton Vests; Special Areas Allowed to Raise Funds in Lieu; Winter Clothing for Refugees Also Included in the Solicitation

The National Winter Clothing Campaign Committee began its solicitation work on September 1 of this year. It is now learned that it has been decided to lead branches in various regions and charitable organizations in a large-scale promotion on this year's Double Tenth Festival, with the aim of collecting three million cotton vests by October 31 for distribution to soldiers fighting in the war, as well as soliciting used clothing for distribution to refugees.

Solicitation Target: Three Million Pieces

The goal of this year's winter clothing solicitation is to collect three million cotton vests. The National Winter Clothing Campaign Committee will continue to be the overall coordinating body, and the various branches and offices will be the implementing agencies for solicitation, sewing, and distribution. The number of items to be shouldered by each province and city will be determined according to their respective environmental and economic conditions, as follows: Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Chongqing, 200,000 pieces each; Fujian, 150,000 pieces; Hubei, Jiangxi, Xikang, Henan, and Gansu, 100,000 pieces each; Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces, 50,000 pieces each, totaling three million pieces.

Nanyang, Hong Kong, and Shanghai: Raising Funds in Lieu. In Nanyang, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places, either due to special circumstances or transportation issues, the focus will be limited to raising funds in lieu of winter clothing. The amount of funds to be shouldered has also been stipulated as follows: one million yuan from Nanyang and overseas Chinese, one hundred thousand yuan from Shanghai, and ten thousand yuan from Hong Kong. After raising the funds, appropriate locations with convenient transportation, materials, and labor in various provinces and cities will be selected for sewing and distribution, with one yuan and five jiao in national currency equivalent to one cotton vest. After sewing, the vests can be directly distributed by the branches to troops and new recruits, conscripts, and wounded soldiers in their respective provinces and cities or neighboring areas, but the total number and the unit numbers to which they are distributed must be notified to the headquarters before distribution to avoid duplication. Those who are unable to sew due to inconvenient material procurement or transportation can remit the collected funds to the headquarters for production and distribution, designating Xi'an, Yichang, Chongqing, Guilin, and Ji'an as centralized distribution locations for cotton vests.

Soliciting Used Clothing: Distributing to Refugees

The solicitation of used clothing for distribution to refugees includes all sizes, lengths, and types. Those who wish to donate cash in lieu of used clothing are also welcome and can hand them over to the local relief agencies under the Central Relief Committee for collection and forwarding. In areas where there are no agencies under the Relief Committee, the Winter Clothing Campaign Headquarters and its branches can be requested to collect and forward them on their behalf. The materials for cotton vests should primarily be sturdy, durable, and non-glossy coarse cloth, preferably in gray, but black, blue, and grass green are also acceptable. Each piece should be padded with no more than seven liang of cotton or coarse fleece.

### Ten-End Term: Absolutely No Concern; Money Shops Prepare Strictly; Industry and Commerce Cautious About Debts

The Money Shops Association believes that as the Ten-End term approaches, the procedures for each member shop to prepare are not only related to external long-term loan settlement, but also internal capital preparation, which deserves especially close attention. Therefore, the Association has not only issued a notice to all member shops yesterday, setting the meeting for the regular meeting of member representatives at 2:00 PM today at the Ningbo Road Association to discuss the interbank lending rates for September, but also scheduled a meeting for 2:00 PM on the 25th of this month to discuss the Ten-End "internal market" rates and the reform of lending operations in each shop. It is understood that the forty-one member shops under the Money Shops Association, including Tongrun, Fuyuan, Hongsheng, Qingda, Anyu, and Fukang, primarily engage in credit lending. With the Ten-End loan settlement term approaching, each shop has begun preparations, and the collection and settlement will soon become busy. Various industries and businesses in this city have also taken precautions against this annual settlement hurdle and are actively preparing their own capital. All outstanding debts are being collected in full before the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all other transactions are generally limited to cash. The current focus is on consolidating cash reserves to safely navigate this Ten-End hurdle, which is expected to be of no concern.

### The Central Bank Implements Agency for the National Treasury; Public Treasury Law Effective Yesterday; Agency Matters Have Been Properly Negotiated

After the National Government promulgated the Public Treasury Law and its implementing regulations, it stipulated that the public treasury of the central government is called the National Treasury, which is managed by the Central Bank as an agent; the public treasury of the provincial government is called the Provincial Treasury; the public treasury of the municipal government is called the Municipal Treasury; and the public treasury of the county government is called the County Treasury, each designating a bank as an agent to manage cash, negotiable instruments, securities, and other property for the government. The Ministry of Finance has, after considering the actual situation, stipulated the effective date and scope of this Public Treasury Law: (1) The National Treasury, except for the four provinces of Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Ningxia, which will be temporarily postponed, and guerrilla areas or places close to war zones where there are indeed special obstacles, which may be temporarily modified by the competent authority of the Public Treasury, will be implemented from October 1; (2) The Provincial, Municipal, and County Treasuries will be implemented from January 1 of next year, and remote provinces and counties or areas with special circumstances may submit their difficulties to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the National Government for approval before January 1 of next year, and may be postponed to April 1 or July 1 of next year. The implementation of the Public Treasury Law is to establish a definitive public treasury system for China and is an important measure for reforming tax administration. The matters concerning the Central Bank's agency for the National Treasury have been properly negotiated with the bank.

### Shanghai Rice Prices After the Autumn Harvest Depend on Transportation; If Transportation is Smooth, Prices May Fall; Top-Quality Accumulated Rice Still Out of Stock in the Market

Since various groups ordered foreign rice from Saigon and transported it to Shanghai for price stabilization, and made every effort to dredge the source of domestic rice, the serious panic problem of the people's food in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession has been resolved. As for the market rice price, at this time when late rice is being harvested, it still cannot fall, mainly due to problems such as source hoarding. It is heard that in order to maintain the people's food, various rice industry groups have advised various vendors to dredge the source of domestic rice, so that the Shanghai rice price can fall back.

Suppressing Hoarding: Not Relaxing

At the same time, the concession authorities are sending personnel to secretly investigate the rice stored within the concession at any time, and strictly implementing the suppression of hoarding. Therefore, the Shanghai rice price in the future, because the late rice will be completely harvested, is expected to fall back soon if transportation is smooth. Recently, there is still sufficient new indica rice on the market, but top-quality domestic rice is still out of stock, and retail prices require more than 40 yuan, but less than 1% of residents purchase it, so the impact on the people's food is still light.

Discussing Market: Trading Rules

In addition, the four industry associations of the bean and rice industry, the rice shops industry, the rice milling industry, and the rice distribution industry, as well as the Changshu Rice Office, the Shanghai North Rice Merchant Lianyi Association, and the Nanbang Association, believe that the previously established trading rules for merchants in the bean and rice market are still incomplete, resulting in frequent disputes between merchants and affecting business significantly. Upon the proposal of various merchants, the "Market Trading Rules" were revised. The seven rice industry groups held a joint meeting on September 26 to discuss the revision. It is learned that the seven rice industry groups have again scheduled a second joint meeting for 3:00 PM today at the Grain, Oil, and Cake Exchange on Aidoa Road to pass the "Draft Market Trading Rules". The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association has sent a letter to the representatives of the seven rice industry groups.

### Shipping Trends: Japan Attempts to Dominate; Britain and France Barely Maintain

Since Japan has obstructed the navigation of various countries in China, attempting to dominate the coastal shipping industry, the shipping industries of various countries in China have been affected. Since the European situation has become serious, the impact on Britain, France, Germany, and other countries has been huge. The following is a record of the shipping situation of various countries in China in August: Table of Merchant Ships Coming and Going by Flag: Japan first with 696 ships, 1,071,4699 tons; Britain second with 195 ships, 684,717 tons; Germany third with 26 ships, 137,387 tons; United States fourth with 16 ships, 106,316 tons; Norway fifth with 39 ships, 103,820 tons; Netherlands sixth with 19 ships, 95,206 tons; France seventh with 21 ships, 76,377 tons; Denmark eighth with 22 ships, 74,023 tons; Italy ninth with 9 ships, 52,690 tons; Sweden tenth with 5 ships, 17,189 tons. However, since September, due to the outbreak of the European war, German shipping to China has stagnated, but British and French shipping continues to barely maintain.

### Restricting the Transport of White Coal to Shanghai

The Zhejiang Provincial Government has specifically restricted the transport of matches and white coal to regulate the balance of civilian goods and stabilize prices: (1) A telegram was sent to the county governments of various counties stating that the supply of matches in this province is insufficient and should be temporarily suspended for export. From the date of the telegram, whole baskets of matches are not allowed to be transported out of the province. Strict prevention is required; (2) It is also stated that white coal is one of the daily necessities, and recently a large number of coal merchants have been collecting it and transporting it to Shanghai for sale, resulting in a gradual increase in white coal prices. In order to suppress the market price, exports should be restricted immediately. All coal merchants should abide by this and not violate it.

### Japanese Person Causes Traffic Accident: Fan Baosheng Crushed and in Critical Condition

At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a Japanese person, Mr. Jia, in a car, passed through the intersection of Tangshan Road and Baoding Road and knocked down a pedestrian, crushing him severely. The police at the post sent the injured person to the Hudong Hospital after the incident. It is heard that the injured person is named Fan Baosheng and is in critical condition.

### Extortion of Leather Goods Shop Owner: Confesses to Instigating Accomplice; Three Defendants Re-examined After Investigation Not Completed

During the first month of this year, a large number of leather goods were stolen from the Dahua Leather Goods Shop on Yuchiaqing Road. After the owner, Shen Mogu, reported it to the police for investigation, and while the police were investigating, Wang Gentao, Sun Shisheng, and others, who had previously partnered with the shop, went to the shop on January 29 with handguns and forced Shen to hand over 500 yuan in legal tender. Because the police suspected that they had stolen the leather, and were in the process of arresting them, Wang and others resorted to this means. At the time, in addition to verbal threats, there was also actual harm to Shen's life. Shen was extremely frightened and jumped out of the window to escape, resulting in serious injuries to his waist and legs. Afterwards, Wang and others sent letters to Shen threatening him, forcing him to hand over 500 yuan, or else they would do something detrimental to the lives of his entire family. Although Shen reported this to the police, Wang and others were not captured until recently, when Hua Detective Xue Youwen of the Laozha Police Station arrested Wang Gentao, Sun Shisheng, and their accomplice Zhou Chuanmao (also known as Xiao Jiangbei).

Three People Detained

Under investigation, Wang and others confessed that the incident was instigated by Gu Fusheng (nickname Xiao Heitan), the owner of the Zhongyu Leather Box Shop at No. 30, Lane 799, Nanjing Road. When the detectives went to arrest him, he had already fled. Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court to hear the case. Shen Mogu claimed that due to his injuries, one of his legs had become disabled, and medical treatment to date had cost him over a thousand gold, as well as various other losses, amounting to no less than

Two or Three Thousand Gold

Therefore, he hired Attorney Wu Peng to file a civil suit as an attachment, requesting that a judgment be issued at the time of sentencing, ordering compensation. However, Police Attorney Ru Baoyi requested a postponement because there were still parts of the case under investigation. Judge Feng, after consulting, ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

### Private Collection of Copper Coins for Melting: Manufacturing Badges for Profit; The Agency that Cracked the Case Prosecutes for Obstructing National Currency

Zha Haishan, a native of Zhenjiang who resided at No. 7, Dexing Lane, Wuding Road, secretly bought old-style copper coins and fen coins, melted them down to manufacture badges for various elementary schools for profit. His livelihood was quite prosperous. Each copper plate, after being made into a badge, could be sold for one yuan and ten mei. The secret agency had been established for more than half a year. The other day, Hua Detective Tao Genrong of the Gordon Road Police Station in charge of the area, learned of this and, together with West Detective Mike Hai, secretly went to the address at 3:15 PM to arrest Zha Haishan. Eighteen copper molds for the badges, 263 old copper plates, 20 fen coins, 960 semi-finished copper yuan badges, and 106 finished badges were seized. The three accomplices Zhang Hongru, Zhao Binghai, and Liu Guochen were also taken into custody and sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Attorney Li Zhishan elaborated on the cracking of the case and prosecuted under Article 2 of the Criminal Law for obstructing national currency, requesting an extension for investigation. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants and presented the evidence for inspection. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the four defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further verification at a later date.

### Continuing to Crack Down on the Production and Sale of Counterfeit Cigarettes

Recently, inferior-quality cigarettes counterfeiting the British brand have been frequently discovered on the market, deceiving customers, and there have been repeated crackdowns. At around 4:00 PM on the 28th of last month, Chang, who was dispatched by the Yongtaihe Tobacco Shop, which distributes British brand cigarettes for the Gu Zhong Tobacco Company, learned that someone was setting up a counterfeiting agency in the kitchen of Lu Qitai's shop at No. 22 Caishi Road, French Concession. He reported this to the French Police, who dispatched detectives to the address and arrested Tang Baosheng (36 years old), a native of Wuxi, on the spot, and seized two large bundles of trademark paper for British brand cigarettes and Red Star brand cigars that had been printed. They were taken to the police station together and transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court a few days ago for handling. Judge Qiu interrogated the defendant and ordered a re-examination at a later date. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Pawnshop Manager Sues Accountant: Repeated Payment of Deposit Interest; Committing Embezzlement and Theft

Lu Jixun, a native of Anhui, 45 years old, the manager of Changda Pawnshop in Chuanxin Street, Daqiao Town, outside the North Gate of Chongming, recently moved to No. 4, Xuehua Lane, Xuehuali Road, French Concession, due to the fall of Chongming. He hired Attorney Zhang Shibeng to represent him and filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, suing Xu Hualiang, the former accountant of the pawnshop (currently residing at No. 3, Fushou Lane, Huanlong Road), for

Embezzlement and Theft

It is alleged that the defendant, while serving as accountant, had a deposit of 1,000 yuan in the account of Liangji. On October 15 of the 25th year of the Republic of China, a new book was issued, and the previous interest had been settled. However, on the general ledger of May of the 26th year, there was a payment of 96 yuan for Liangji's interest, and in January of the 27th year, another 124 yuan was paid. However, from October 15 of the 25th year to January of the 27th year, a total of 15 months and 15 days, calculated at the fixed monthly interest rate of 8 li, is 124 yuan. It can be seen that the 96 yuan paid in May of the 26th year was clearly a duplicate payment. A letter was sent to

Liangji Depositor

To inquire, and it was replied that it had not been received, which clearly indicates that the defendant embezzled it and should be held responsible. In March of last year, due to the fall of the locality, 80 taels of gold jewelry were stolen from Changda Pawnshop, and the defendant is also suspected of being a co-conspirator in the theft. The defendant has now left his post and is hiding in Shanghai and is bound to flee. Therefore, it is requested that the case be arrested and investigated, and that the crime be sentenced according to Articles 336 and 320 of the Criminal Law. The court, based on the complaint, opened a criminal

Second Court Summons

On the afternoon of the other day by Judge Miao Qingbang. The defendant did not appear, only the plaintiff and his attorney were present, requesting an arrest warrant, or that the plaintiff designate the defendant to appear in court for questioning. After consulting, the court ruled to postpone the hearing and allow the plaintiff to designate the defendant to appear in court for a re-examination, and then adjourned the court.

### Found a Bomb: Death from Explosion

At 9:50 AM yesterday morning, Lu Fangqing (57 years old), a resident of the east end of the Sikaizi Bridge in Hongkou, found a small bomb on the riverbank at that location. At the time, Lu did not know that it was a dangerous item and immediately took it home, intending to see what it was by striking it hard with a hammer. Unexpectedly, the bomb suddenly exploded with a loud bang, and Lu was immediately injured by the explosion, his body covered in blood and flesh, a tragic sight. He was taken to the hospital after the incident, but died of his injuries.

### Joking Leads to Murder Case: The Perpetrator's Trial Concludes Awaiting Judgment

Zhao Kun, a native of Shaoxing who worked as a carpenter at the Huanqiu Iron Factory at No. 211, Binlang Road, at 1:50 AM on the 9th of this month, had a verbal dispute with Lu Senshui, a copper worker from the same factory and of the same origin, over a trivial matter. He broke into his bedroom with an axe and, while he was sound asleep, hacked him in the head and arms a total of eight times. The case was reported, and the Chinese and Western detectives of the Putuo Road Police Station arrested him and sent him to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. The injured Lu Senshui was sent to the same hospital for treatment but died the following morning at 11:00 AM. The corpse was taken to the Jiaozhou Road Corpse Examination Office, where the forensic doctor determined that he had died from axe wounds. The other day, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Police Attorney Li Zhishan filed a public prosecution under Article 271 of the Criminal Law for murder, stating that the origin of the dispute between the defendant and Lu Senshui was merely a trivial matter. During dinner on the evening of the 6th, Wan Yingchang, a worker from the same factory, played a prank on him by combining two bowls of rice into one, which led to mutual animosity and violence, and the anger was directed at the deceased Lu Senshui, who helped push him down. The matter was very trivial, and Lu Senshui had apologized to him afterwards. Unexpectedly, such a tragic event would unfold. Subsequently, he went to Wan Yingchang's room and struck his head with an axe, but missed, and the axe penetrated the bed wood to a depth of two inches. He is still angry in his statement, saying that Lu should not have helped beat him. It can be seen that his heart is vicious and extremely brutal. He requests that he be severely punished. Judge Huang ruled that he remain in custody and await a scheduled sentencing.

### Pimping Under the Guise of a Domestic Helper: Luring Young Girls into Prostitution; Fei and Li's Daughters Lured into the Trap; Police Crack the Case, the Main Perpetrator is at Large

A man named Wang Boqing, who runs a brothel at No. 34, Lane 243, Yunnan Road, specializes in luring good women and forcing them into prostitution. However, his method of luring young women is quite ingenious. Wang has a mistress named Tang Lingmei, who usually goes out to work as a domestic helper. If she is hired by a family with a young woman, she will

Flatter and Entice in Every Way

Once they fall into the trap, they will abscond together. Recently, Tang Lingmei was hired by the Fei Song family from Huzhou at No. 4, Jiande Lane, Yuyuan Road. Fei has a daughter named Huamei, 17 years old, with a beautiful appearance. She usually has close contact with Li Jufang, the daughter of her relative Li Ni. Tang Lingmei took the opportunity to be deliberately intimate with them and entice them with honeyed words. After a considerable period of time, the two girls were indeed lured and on September 11, Fei Huamei and Li Jufang and Tang Lingmei

Disappeared One After Another

After the families of the two girls found out, they sent out scouts to search, but to no avail. On September 26, Fei Song suddenly received a call from Zhu Xianglong, a barber shop worker at No. 85 Pike Road, saying that his niece was now located and asking him to come quickly. Fei went to the address and met Zhu. Zhu led him to No. 34, Lane 24, Yunnan Road, and indeed saw Huamei, Jufang, Wang Boqing, and others together. At that time, because Jufang

Refused to Go Home

Huamei was taken back alone, and a report was filed with the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Detective Liang Junshan was dispatched to investigate, but Wang Boqing had already fled. Only Li Jufang was found. Xu Jingliang was arrested at No. 227, Andong Hotel, Hubei Road. A woman named Zhang Hua was arrested in Room 61, Xinshanghai Hotel, Fujian Road. Women Wang Peifang and Zhao Xiaochen, Yang Shunquan from Pudong, were arrested in Rooms 8 and 9 of the Wuzhou Hotel on Wuma Road, and Li Suzhen, a 17-year-old girl from Nanxiang, was found.

Taken to the Police Station Together

They were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Court a few days ago. Police Attorney Jiang Baolian stated the case, saying that after Fei and Li's daughters were lured, Wang Boqing deflowered them on the same night in a small inn and then took them to the brothel he opened and forced them to receive guests. Li Suzhen was also the same. The main perpetrator is now at large and a postponement is requested. The court ruled that they be remanded in custody pending further verification at a later date.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor: I saw in your newspaper yesterday's local news section an article stating that the coal market panic is gradually being alleviated, and the lower paragraph of the article quotes a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency as saying that the city only needs 5,000 tons of coal per month and has a previous inventory of 10,000 tons. The information in this is quite inaccurate. Shanghai is a major commercial port with a population of several million. How can the coal consumption and inventory be only this number? Since the Shanghai War, the peak months in the past have required up to 150,000 tons per month, and the lean months have required at least 100,000 tons. The thickest inventory of each warehouse was 400,000 tons, and the thinnest was more than 100,000 tons. The information above is very inconsistent with the actual situation, so I am writing to correct it. Sincerely, Fang Chunpu.

To the Editor: According to my client, the manager of Shunchang Pawnshop at No. 125 Xiafei Road, after reading the newspaper on October 1, Shanghai news bar, carried an pawn shop that suffered a fire, refused to compensate news, which stated that the Baotai pawnshop at the intersection of Fada Road and Baliao Bridge was opened by Chaozhou people Xia Deyang (the owner of Shunchang Pawnshop on Xiafei Road), etc., is very alarming. I checked that the shop is a member of the Shanghai Pawnshop Association, and there is no Xia Deyang. Baotai pawnshop and Xia Deyang are not related to the shop. It is important to the reputation of the shop. Entrusted to the newspaper to make corrections, etc. Accordingly, I am writing to inform you, and I hope you will check and make corrections. Attorney Zhang Shibeng, October 1.

To the Editor: This month on October 1, your newspaper carried an article about a fire in Baotai Pawnshop, refusing to compensate, which is inconsistent with the facts. The owner of the pawnshop is neither from Chaozhou nor is he the owner of Shunchang Pawnshop. This was completely destroyed by fire, according to the rules there is no compensation, as for gold and silver jewelry, because it was not destroyed, it had long been entrusted to the lawyer to be announced redeemable, there was no refusal, nor was there any lawyer Ji Chao coming to negotiate. It is appropriate to write a letter to your newspaper to correct this immediately, in order to avoid external misunderstandings. Attorney Wang Hengyi, October 1, 28th year.

### Children's Clothing Cutting and Design

— Fen Wen

For ease of calculation, let's assume the width of the fabric is two feet. The number of items to be made is one piece, and the types of clothing are temporarily divided into three categories: long gowns, short shirts, and trousers.

First, let's talk about long gowns. For children aged six to eight, the height of a larger child is about two feet, the waist is five inches, and five feet six inches of fabric should be cut. If it is a lined gown, an additional five feet of lining should be cut. For children aged nine to ten, the average height is two feet five inches, the waist is five inches and one minute, and six feet five inches of fabric should be cut. For a lined gown, an additional six feet two inches of lining should be cut. For ages eleven to twelve, the height is three feet, the waist is five inches and three minutes, and seven feet five inches of fabric should be cut. For a lined gown, an additional seven feet of lining should be cut. For ages thirteen to fifteen, the height is three feet four inches, and the waist is six inches, nine feet of fabric should be cut, and for a lined gown, an additional eight feet five inches of lining should be cut.

Next, let's talk about short shirts. For ages six to eight, the length is one foot three inches, the waist is five inches, and two feet six inches of fabric should be cut. For a lined jacket, an additional two feet four inches of lining should be cut. For ages nine to ten, the length is one foot four inches, the waist is five inches and one minute, and three feet of fabric should be cut. For a lined jacket, an additional two feet seven inches of lining should be cut. For ages eleven to twelve, the length is one foot five inches, the waist is five inches and three minutes, and three feet two inches of fabric should be cut. For a lined jacket, an additional two feet nine inches of lining should be cut. For ages thirteen to fifteen, the length is one foot five inches, the waist is six inches, and four feet of fabric should be cut. For a lined jacket, an additional three feet five inches of lining should be cut.

As for trousers, for ages six to eight, the length is one foot six inches, and three feet two inches of fabric should be cut. For a lined pair of trousers, an additional three feet of lining should be cut. For ages nine to ten, the length is one foot eight inches, and three feet six inches of fabric should be cut. For lined trousers, an additional three feet four inches of lining should be cut. For ages eleven to twelve, the length is two feet, and four feet of fabric should be cut. For lined trousers, an additional three feet nine inches of lining should be cut. For ages thirteen to fifteen, the length is two feet two inches, and four feet four inches of fabric should be cut. For lined trousers, an additional four feet two inches of lining should be cut.

This is just a simple and general design. If the body size is different, for every increase of one minute in height, two minutes of fabric can be added, and so on. Smart housewives will definitely be able to expand or reduce according to this principle themselves, without having to rely on tailors or others.

### The Bandit Queller of the Residence—The Cat

— Yao Ting

When a cat is in the family, rats can be eliminated. Therefore, the cat is worthy of being the bandit queller of the residence. Regarding the cat's form and temperament, everyone knows them, so there is no need to repeat them. The only thing that everyone neglects is the issue of raising cats, especially kittens, which are most likely to die prematurely. People often say that "rats are causing trouble" or "there is no fortune in raising livestock." This superstitious idea is not credible. Based on my actual research, I feel that this problem is nothing more than the following points:

First, cats are carnivores, and their intestines are particularly thin and long, winding complexly in the abdomen. Children often like to catch cats and twist their abdomens forcefully, which can easily cause the intestines to stick together or be injured. As a result, bowel movements become abnormal, digestion is impaired, and death results. Second, kittens do not know when they are full or hungry and eat according to their desires. People often put the food bowl on the table, allowing it to eat at any time, which is not suitable for adult cats; using it to treat kittens is an even greater mistake. Third, salt should be added to the kitten's food. People often only stew small fish plainly, neglecting the salt. Over time, kittens will get sick due to lack of salt. Fourth, kittens often have fleas, which is a major problem for them. It is best to wash them often. Otherwise, sprinkle the powder of camphor balls on their bodies, and the fleas will disappear. Fifth, some places with soft cushions should be prepared for the kittens to live in because if they do not have good sleeping places, they often lodge near the stove, where they are exposed to dirt; the fur is also damaged as a result. Gradually, they are ruined, leading to illness and death.

The five points above are the things that people pay the least attention to but are the most important facts. If you can earnestly study them and improve them, then it will not be difficult to raise a kitten into a lovely, healthy, and bandit-quelling resident.

### A Week's Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Last week I mentioned the beauty of crab roe tofu soup, and this week I might as well talk about tofu again. Recently, my family often eats green vegetable and tofu soup, almost every two or three days. These two things are rich in vitamins. Doctors often advise sick people to eat more green vegetable soup, so it can be seen that it is beneficial to the body. Now that tofu is added, isn't it doubly beneficial? Chicken feather vegetables are the best for green vegetables. If you feel that making soup with only chicken feather vegetables and tofu is too monotonous, then you can add other things to it; since we happen to have a piece of ham on hand, we can cut some ham strips and add them together with the side tips of shiitake mushrooms, which will naturally feel even more delicious. If there is no ham, pork strips and beef slices can also be used, so why don't you try it? In addition, meat dishes such as stir-fried tofu with small white shrimp, pan-fried tofu with salted pomfret, and chicken or duck blood tofu soup; and vegetarian dishes such as stir-fried tofu with silk melon, stir-fried tofu with snow cabbage, and stir-fried tofu with garland chrysanthemum, are also wonderful dishes to eat with rice.

Monday

Stir-fried beef strips with onions, Stir-fried tofu with white shrimp, Stir-fried amaranth with fried bread sticks, Fried fermented tofu

Tuesday

White meat radish soup, Sweet and sour crucian carp, Stir-fried golden needle vegetable, Broad bean paste with chopped scallions

Wednesday

Beef sweet potato cakes, Braised white fish slices, Green vegetable and tofu soup, Taro dumplings with edamame

Thursday

Stir-fried pork strips with garlic sprouts, Braised tofu with salted pomfret, Stir-fried broad beans with sweet sauce, Braised shredded radish

Friday

Curry beef slices, Crab in bean batter with edamame, Stir-fried cellophane noodles with green vegetables, Stir-fried hundred-leaf with water caltrop

Saturday

Braised pork with dried bamboo shoots, Stir-fried tofu with shrimp, Snow cabbage with soybean sprouts, Braised vegetarian ten-scene

### Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation in an Economical Student Dormitory

— Jun Mu

The student economic dormitory on the seventh, eighth, and ninth floors of the Wuzhou Building at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Henan Road is run by the YMCA, commissioned by the National Student Relief Committee. The association allocated more than 8,000 yuan, and the YMCA donated more than 2,000 yuan, for a total funding of more than 10,000 yuan. Those who are admitted to live in the dormitory, regardless of gender or religion, must be currently enrolled students. Those who wish to live in the dormitory must first have a guarantor (who must reside in this port and have a legitimate occupation) fill out a guarantee letter, the school principal must fill out an identity certificate, and they must personally write a detailed resume and a family financial situation form. Then, they must take them to the dormitory authorities to register. If there are vacancies, they will be notified by letter after an interview and determination that they are qualified. There are a total of ninety-seven beds available, but there are many people who register, always numbering in the hundreds each time. The dormitory has three administrators, including one director, and male and female administrators, who are stationed in the dormitory full-time to manage all matters. The above is a general overview of the student economic dormitory. Now, I will talk about the main topic of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. However, I will not talk about them in the order of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, but will describe them in order of importance and my personal subjective view.

Regarding housing, since all the residents are students (mostly university students, accounting for more than three-fifths of the total), everything is a group life. Although it cannot be compared with the school life before the war, it is the closest to the ideal under the current abnormal environment. The most distressing thing for students coming to Shanghai for education is the housing problem, which is probably the origin of the economic dormitory. The dormitory has three floors. The seventh floor has one administrator's office, one reception room, six student bedrooms, and one female administrator's bedroom, which is the women's section. The eighth and ninth floors are the men's section. The eighth floor has three student bedrooms and one male administrator's bedroom. The ninth floor has one bedroom and one reading room. The reading room is also located on the ninth floor. The monthly dormitory fee for residents is five yuan, and the miscellaneous fee is one yuan, payable every three months. Students who live in the dormitory for the first time must also pay a deposit of five yuan (currently, due to the increase in the price of water and electricity, a special miscellaneous fee of one yuan is temporarily charged per month from October 1). The dormitory authorities provide each person with a canvas bed and a small desk. The beds in the bedrooms are quite crowded, with two beds always combined together, so they are only used for sleeping. To study, you must go to the reading room on the ninth floor, but the reading room is also quite small, accommodating up to thirty-five people. The room contains four newspapers: Shen Bao, China-US Daily (now discontinued), Xinwen Bao, and Continental Daily (English). In addition, there are various books and magazines for students to read. A world map and a map of China are hung on one wall of the room, with a national flag in the middle, which is rare in an isolated island. Each floor of the dormitory has bathroom facilities, and hot water is supplied for four days every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday afternoons (there is hot water every morning and afternoon every day, but now it is because of the sharp decline in foreign exchange and the high price of various items). Resident students have a student association organization, which holds a general meeting every month to make decisions. The general meeting produces an executive committee to lead all student activities. There are academic, singing, sports, recreation...etc. departments, so student activities are very lively. The academic department publishes a wall newspaper every half month. The academic and singing departments also held two lectures on Mandarin and singing during the summer vacation, which have now ended and achieved satisfactory results. At the closing ceremony, the Mandarin group performed a drama, and the singing group sang various new songs. The sports department holds morning exercises every morning. The dormitory currently employs two tea servers and one boy to clean the student bedrooms, make boiling water, and do miscellaneous tasks.

Regarding food, I am afraid that there is no place in the Shanghai Concession that is cheaper than this dormitory (of course, special circumstances are exceptions). The current full board fee is ten yuan and seventy-five cents per month, and half board (one breakfast plus either lunch or dinner) is six yuan and thirty-five cents. The dining area will use the reading room as a temporary dining hall. In addition, students themselves organize a consumer cooperative, which not only sells practical necessities but also has dry snacks, sweets, and other foods for students to temporarily fill their stomachs.

Regarding clothing, most of the residents are poor, so the students' clothes are very simple and rarely extravagant. Because of clothing, I think of the problem of laundry. Students' outer clothes are laundered twice a week, and shorts and undershirts are all washed by themselves. The dormitory authorities also provide drying bamboo for use, and the women's section also has drying racks because the women's long outer clothes are also often washed by themselves.

Regarding transportation, what I want to discuss is not the travel of the resident students outside, but the travel after entering the Wuzhou Building. The elevator can be taken to the sixth floor, and then you have to climb the stairs. At mealtimes, the students on the seventh and eighth floors have to walk up to the temporary dining hall on the ninth floor, which is most convenient for those living on the ninth floor, but usually, it is the most laborious for those living on the ninth floor. Each floor has a large platform that can be used for morning exercises and walks.

The above is a general description of the clothing, food, housing, and transportation situation in the student economic dormitory, which is sufficient for students who want to live in the dormitory to refer to.

Spring and Autumn

### The First Day of the Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes

The public welcomes and exchanges at tobacco shops　Tobacco shops hoard goods for profit at eight cents per dime

It was a clear autumn morning. The newsboys were shouting, "Want to see the fractional currency notes issued by the Central Bank today...one cent red...five cents green..." Because everyone wanted to know how to get their hands on the fractional currency notes, the newspaper selling business was several times better than usual.

At the north end of Mintini Yin Road, a paper signboard hung on the counter railing of a certain tobacco shop. Written on the red paper was: "This shop exchanges fractional and five-cent fractional currency notes." The eyes of passers-by were focused on this signboard. Although there were only a few blue characters, its magic was truly incredible!

"Exchange for fractional currency notes!" A young man stepped onto the sidewalk and put a one-yuan China Bank banknote on the counter.

"I don't exchange for one yuan. I only exchange for a maximum of two dimes per person!" The shop assistant replied while packing fried fruit pulp.

"Why? You don't exchange for one yuan. You can only exchange for two dimes!" The young man asked again.

"Sir, I'm really sorry! Our shop only exchanged for a total of fifty yuan. If each person exchanges for one yuan, we can only serve fifty customers. Because today is the first day of issuing fractional currency notes, everyone wants some. Even if each person can only exchange for two dimes, I'm afraid that those fifty yuan in fractional currency notes will definitely be exchanged in less than two hours. Fortunately, we can continue to exchange tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Why don't you exchange for two dimes first!" The shop assistant explained the reasons very kindly. He took out two five-cent and eight one-cent fractional currency notes, as well as eight ten-cent corner notes, from a small iron box on the counter. He looked at both sides of the young man's one-yuan banknote before putting it into the drawer of the counter.

"What? Two dimes only exchange for one dime and eight cents?" The young man asked in surprise.

"Two dimes for nine cents, isn't that cheap? It's much more cost-effective than those dirty stamps and fake vouchers! Besides, if you go to exchange them yourself, it will cost you transportation and time. Now, exchanging for nine cents per dime is just to cover some of our transportation costs!" The shop assistant argued in detail again.

The young man counted the stack of brand-new fractional currency notes on the counter, arranged them neatly, put them in his pocket, and left the tobacco shop.

One after another, those exchanging for fractional currency notes were endless. Because they had been waiting for something for a long time, once they got it in their hands, they were willing to accept it even if the discount was a bit bigger.

In less than half an hour of exchanging, most of the fractional currency notes in the shop had been exchanged. Therefore, the exchange premium also increased to 20% at the same time, "One dime corner note, only exchanges for eight cents in fractional currency notes," but those holding corner notes to exchange for fractional currency notes continued non-stop. Among them, some of those holding corner notes to exchange for fractional currency notes were eleven or twelve-year-old children. They were all driven by curiosity, thinking that it was the most glorious thing to get fractional currency notes first and hold them in their hands in front of their classmates at school.

While the fractional currency notes were decreasing one by one, the profits were also increasing one by one at the same time. When the last part of the fractional currency notes was left, the signboard had already been removed by the shop assistant. At this time, you had to buy some tobacco and miscellaneous goods, and at the same time, you could exchange for a dime of fractional currency notes incidentally. Otherwise, just exchanging fractional currency notes would be met with their contempt!

In just one hour of exchanging, the owner of the tobacco shop had unexpectedly earned a windfall for nothing. (Star)

### Stabilizing China's Currency System

— Xing Huo

People have endured the suffering of difficult-to-use vouchers, and they are really looking forward to the issuance of new fractional currency notes so much that they are about to cry! No wonder the news of the start of exchanging new fractional currency notes spread, and the whole city was a bit dazed. On the trams and in front of the shops, everyone was asking about new fractional currency notes. When the shop assistant answered "no," they would feel an invisible sense of frustration and disappointment. On the contrary, if they obtained fractional currency notes, an irrepressible joy would flow from between their eyebrows; as if they had obtained a treasure, they would show it to their friends and proudly boast, "Look! Do you have this?" Although the value is only one cent or five cents, those who have not seen it will inevitably cast strange eyes, snatch it over to look at it, and at the same time give it a high-priced critique. "After all, the notes printed by the government are imposing!" However, just look, don't think about taking advantage of it. Not to mention taking advantage of it, even if you accidentally fold a corner of a brand-new, flat fractional currency note, it will make people very unhappy.

Why are people welcoming fractional currency notes so enthusiastically? Waiting for a long time is certainly one reason. But people's "welcoming the new" mentality and the scarcity of circulation in the market have also raised their value. Speaking of the small number of circulations in the market, on the one hand, it is because the Bank of China has adopted a gradual issuance system, and on the other hand, it is because of the hoarding of tobacco and exchange businesses. The scarcer it is in the market, the more severe people's demands will be. And taking the opportunity to profit is naturally no problem. The author is one of those who exchanged nine cents for one dime of fractional currency notes. This has almost become a consistent phenomenon. In the past, when ten-cent and twenty-cent nickel coins and one-cent copper coins were issued, prices were also raised. Half of the formation of this phenomenon is due to the improper method of issuance now. Simply calling on the money exchange industry to issue them is tantamount to giving the money exchange industry the opportunity to profit. And the uneven distribution of the money exchange industry can be seen from the incident of the money exchange industry association arguing and injuring seven people. Therefore, to eliminate miscellaneous vouchers, new fractional currency must be widely circulated among the people; to be widespread, the current method cannot be achieved. The Bank of China's adoption of a gradual issuance system is intended to avoid bank runs, but limiting a number (ten yuan, fifty yuan, or one hundred yuan) will not actually cause much congestion, and circulation in the market will definitely be faster.

The problem must be summarized again to "commercial morality." If we consider moral issues, after being forced to use "Huaxing currency," ordinary merchants have been secretly trading "Huaxing currency." The root cause of this phenomenon lies in the lack of "commercial morality." Although "the heavens are high and the emperor is far away," national law cannot cope with the special actions of isolated islands, but if we do not consider ourselves "slaves of a conquered nation," we must still abide by the laws of the country. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance's announcement prohibiting the trading of "Huaxing currency" must be strictly enforced, and the Bank of China's announcement of full cash redemption of fractional currency notes must not be followed superficially.

Stabilizing China's currency system is the responsibility of each of us.

### The Frustration of the Second Landlord's Dream of Prosperity

— Xin Meng

Since the overcrowding situation occurred in the Shanghai Concession, the demand for housing has exceeded the supply, and it has suddenly become insufficient. Although the rent is scary high, it is not easy to rent a house, and rent advertisements are rarely seen. This is inversely proportional to the thick stacks of red, tofu-like rent advertisements posted at every alleyway before "August 13th."

However, Shanghai's deformed prosperity could not last after all. The golden age passed in an instant. Because of the high price of rice and the soaring prices of all goods, most people were trapped on the "isolated island" and could not maintain their livelihoods. If this continued, it would be nothing more than sitting and waiting for death. So, they began to leave Shanghai, either to the interior or back to their hometowns.

This situation can be fully proven by the reappearance of rent advertisements. These days, when we go outside, we can see rent advertisement slips posted everywhere in alleyways and on utility poles. Numerically speaking, although there are not as many as before "August 13th," there are significantly more than a few months ago.

According to unofficial statistics, recently, due to the extremely high cost of living in Shanghai, the number of residents returning to their hometowns or going to the interior has averaged three or four hundred families per day. Those without jobs, who had spent all the money they brought out to escape to the "isolated island," had no choice but to go to the countryside. Even those with jobs, if their salaries were too low, would send their families back to the interior.

Under these circumstances, the number of vacant houses will naturally increase day by day. In addition, recently built houses can be seen everywhere. So, the overcrowding problem has long passed, and finding a house is not as difficult as it was a few months ago. However, the general second landlords are still dreaming of prosperity. Not only are the rents not cheap, but even old tenants have to pay more rent!

But in fact, people are scattering day by day. In the future, there may be even more vacant houses in Shanghai. By the end of this year, we believe that there will be many more rent advertisement slips posted at every alleyway entrance. Will the second landlords' dreams of prosperity be able to continue forever?
