### Britain's Far East Policy Unchanged: Not Recognizing Situations Created by Force; Maintaining Close Contact with All Related Countries; Considering Assistance to China at All Times; Lord Strabolgi Enumerates Japanese Crimes

(London) During today's House of Lords meeting, Lord Strabolgi delivered a speech severely criticizing Japan's arrogant behavior in the war against China. The vehemence of his wording was rarely heard in both the upper and lower houses when discussing Japan's actions in China. Strabolgi stated in his speech that: (1) the war is currently being waged with extreme brutality and savagery; (2) the Japanese authorities in "Manchukuo" are deliberately using opium and other drugs to poison the Chinese people; (3) the Japanese military is systematically destroying Chinese universities and research institutions everywhere; (4) corrupt and shameless regimes have emerged in the Japanese-occupied areas, acting arbitrarily and engaging in all kinds of evil; (5) the Japanese military's attacks on fishing boats constitute the most hateful crimes. Strabolgi also emphasized that the battles being fought by the Chinese army today are no less than battles for Great Britain. The main purpose of Strabolgi's speech was to request the government to provide information on the war in China. Strabolgi also paid special attention to the situation in South China, asking the following questions in his speech: (1) What steps is the government taking to protect British trade interests? (2) What is the situation regarding the Japanese military's invasion of Hainan Island? (3) Has the government engaged in any joint policy with other relevant powers to end the war?

Strabolgi's speech stated that raising this issue now is by no means intended to antagonize the British government. The Duke of Plymouth's speech in the House of Lords on December 6th of last year, in response to the debate on the China issue, expressed a firm attitude towards this issue of great importance to British interests in China. Unexpectedly and to the delight of the audience, his words contained a clear warning to let the Japanese know that our patience is not endless. However, since then, several very important events have occurred in China, such as the sudden invasion of Hainan Island, the virtual blockade of a large part of Hong Kong since the fall of Guangzhou, and the various threats made by the Japanese authorities to the Shanghai International Settlement. Fortunately, Japan has changed its attitude today, and the so-called Nanjing government is actually using bizarre language to oppose the British and French people in the Public Concession, which is truly outrageous.

Strabolgi stated directly that the Japanese military's invasion of Hainan Island was purely provocative. In terms of fighting the Chinese central government, occupying the island serves no military purpose. The French authorities in Vietnam, after being requested by Japan, have prevented munitions, and even Red Cross supplies, from being transported to China. Japan then agreed to recognize Hainan Island as part of France's sphere of interest and not attack it, as a reward. Today, the French can see what the Japanese have rewarded them with. From this alone, it can be seen that the so-called "appeasement" policy is, in Japan's case, utterly useless.

Strabolgi concluded by mentioning the new automobile highway between Burma and southwestern China, saying that this is the only language the Japanese warlords can understand. If they broaden their horizons and look at the overall situation, they can see that the Chinese are fighting for us today. If the Japanese army had been able to break the Chinese army's resistance within ninety days two years ago, how long would it have taken to directly threaten Hong Kong, then Malaya, and then the Dutch East Indies? If Japan had subdued the Chinese, and if we were entangled in some disputes in Europe, would anyone dare to say that British interests in the Pacific would be safe and untouched? Strabolgi emphasized that the war against China today is not an old-fashioned war of conquest. It is being waged with extreme brutality and savagery. "The Japanese authorities in Manchuria are deliberately using opium and other drugs to ensnare the Chinese people. Any Chinese university or research institution is being systematically destroyed. Corrupt and shameless regimes have emerged in the Japanese-occupied areas, acting arbitrarily and engaging in all kinds of evil. European and American businesses are being excluded. The Foreign Office is aware of the tragic atrocities that have occurred. When Nanjing was occupied, the Japanese authorities ordered soldiers to engage in violence, and even British and American representatives were insulted. They have repeatedly criticized the German regime, but on this occasion, the actions of the Nanjing Kuomintang officials were admirable in their resoluteness. They helped refugees escape, saving them from the massacre and defilement by the barbaric and undisciplined Japanese soldiers.

Strabolgi went on to condemn the Japanese military's attacks on helpless fishing boats, saying that the sea is a place of shared peace, and the people on the fishing boats are all Chinese sailors, a truly excellent people who always lend a hand when ordinary disasters occur at sea. They take their wives and children with them, but the Japanese military attacks them with airplanes. This is a truly hateful act, and it is impossible to find words to adequately condemn it. He believes that the government has protested to the Japanese government, and he is not criticizing the government for turning a blind eye to this tragedy.

Strabolgi then referred to the German Nazi officials in Nanjing, saying that he had received information that German merchants were just as alarmed and uneasy as British merchants about everything China was experiencing. The German officials were the ones who took a supportive and comforting attitude to deal with the Japanese authorities. Therefore, there is now a great opportunity for the German government to demonstrate its loyalty, humanity, and desire for peace. The method is to unite with us and other relevant powers to apply diplomatic or economic pressure to curb the efforts of the Japanese warlords in China. Chamberlain's policy of appeasement has brought great benefits to Germany. If Germany is willing to make a small return, there is an opportunity in China, where German interests are the same as ours. Hitler recently announced that Germany must export goods, or we will perish. China has a vast market. If Japan's policy in China is successfully implemented, the Germans will have no chance to obtain it. After two years of fierce fighting, everyone knows that Japan is an economically vulnerable country. If Japan is subjected to economic pressure at this time, it will be easily defeated.

Our friends in China, and the compatriots of the Chinese nation, millions of whom live in our eastern territories and are good citizens, do not understand why we are not more actively seeking to end this tragic war. Before this military effort is realized, Japanese businesses in China can make great strides. However, the Japanese warlords do not want to see a peaceful, strong, and unified China. The younger generation of warlords, who seem to control the policies of the Japanese government, do not conceal their goals. If they succeed, they will undoubtedly threaten Australia. Members of all parties have no illusions about this issue. The time is now to implement justice, righteousness, and fairness. This kind of Christianity and humanitarianism has been greatly devastated in Europe and Asia Minor in the past six months. Evil is rampant, and human civilization and morality have been expelled. Can we not begin to advocate this great doctrine in Asia, as a remedy for what remains after the catastrophe? We can rely on the sincere assistance of India, Australia, and New Zealand. I believe that the Soviet Union, France, and the Netherlands will also respond. The policy I advocate is a peaceful policy that can be achieved without firing a shot. I believe that the League of Nations should have done this work more than two years ago. In any case, if the British government seeks to exert collective pressure diplomatically, and if necessary, economically and then financially, we believe its power will be sufficient. The lessons needed are that cruel force, terror, and bestial ferocity will gain nothing, but only invite inevitable punishment."

The Duke of Plymouth, representing the government, replied that the difficulty in dealing with this issue lies in giving practical effect to any desires or emotions we may have. He largely sympathized with what Lord Strabolgi had said, but he wondered whether Strabolgi had carefully considered the feasibility of implementing some of his suggestions.

After reporting on recent events in China, Plymouth described the actions taken by the British government to protect British interests in China, especially in Hong Kong. He said that the Pearl River is extremely important to Hong Kong's trade. The Sino-British treaty of 1842 stipulated the opening of the Pearl River for British trade. When the Chinese authorities first blockaded the river on October 13th of last year, the British Consul-General in Guangzhou protested to the Chinese side. Since the Japanese military occupied Guangzhou, they have continued to blockade the Pearl River. The British government has been actively working to reopen it, but these efforts have not yet been effective. The British government is now considering the possibility of taking further measures to achieve this goal. In short, the British government insists on continuing to operate as it currently does, and will do everything in its power to ensure that British trade and shipping in Japanese-occupied areas are not subject to discrimination in favor of Japanese or any other interests. According to recent information, although the Guangzhou Customs is not firmly under Japanese control, it is to some extent controlled by the Japanese, as is the case with the Shanghai Customs. Some Japanese personnel have been added to its staff. The same is true of the Hainan Island Customs. The Guangzhou Customs administration was able to remain safe and sound during the Japanese military's attack on and occupation of Guangzhou, thanks to the courage and perseverance of Mr. Happer, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs at the Guangdong Customs at the time.

Plymouth then recounted the various facts of the occupation of Hainan Island, and cited the statement made by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita that the duration of the Japanese military's occupation of the island would be determined by military needs. He later said that while he knew the significance of this matter in terms of military strategy or tactics, he could not say that Britain had any truly important interests on the island. However, the position of the French government was undoubtedly different from that of Britain. The French government's treaty position was based on China's guarantee in 1897 not to cede the island to another country, and the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907. As for Britain, it had no such agreement with Japan. What is related to this situation is only the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. Plymouth felt it was difficult to judge whether Lord Strabolgi's claim that the Japanese actions were not intended to threaten the position of the Chinese government, but rather to threaten or worry the British and French governments. What he could say was that the reason given by the Japanese to the British was the statement made by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita regarding the need for the military situation, which Lord Strabolgi had quoted. This statement was very ambiguous, but this was the position that the Japanese government had explained to the British.

Plymouth spoke of the situation in Tianjin, saying that the current situation in Tianjin, generally speaking, was similar to what he had reported last December. The British government had made it clear to the Japanese government that the British authorities in the Tianjin British Concession had no intention of not cooperating, and were prepared to arrest anyone who had committed acts of terrorism or other crimes and hand them over to the Japanese side, but only after the Japanese side had presented sufficient evidence to prove the person's guilt and that the case had indeed been established.

Generally speaking, the British government's Far East policy is based on the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, the British government, without mincing words, had stated explicitly in its note to the Japanese government on January 14th that the British government could not recognize any changes made by force or unilateral action that involved the violation or abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty. The British government also could not agree with the claim that the Nine-Power Treaty was outdated or that its provisions were no longer suitable for the situation. The changes in the current situation were caused by the Japanese government's violation of the treaty. The British government believes that the treaty is permanent. If the Japanese government or any other signatory country puts forward constructive suggestions on what it believes can improve the treaty, the British government is prepared to consider them and negotiate these amendments jointly with other signatory countries. The British government is also prepared to reopen negotiations with the Chinese government on extraterritoriality after peace is restored. Although the note, including the above points, was sent to the Japanese government on January 14th, the Japanese government has not yet responded. He had just said that, in the British government's opinion, any measure, such as those mentioned by Lord Strabolgi, unless it is a plan that can be implemented effectively, may not be truly beneficial in solving this kind of difficulty. Because if the various economic sanctions mentioned by Lord Strabolgi were to be implemented, it would be absolutely necessary for all parties involved to act unanimously and simultaneously. The British government has assisted the Chinese government in various ways in extremely difficult circumstances. He would like the House to pay attention to this. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the British government has kept Hong Kong open as a route for Chinese transportation, but this route is no longer available after the fall of Guangzhou. Britain has also built a road from Burma to the Chinese border. Recently, the British government has obtained the power under the Export Guarantees Act and used it to provide more convenient guarantees to China. In short, the British government is always considering the general situation and never lets it out of mind.

Some people ask if we can put pressure on the Japanese government so that the war in China can end sooner. In his opinion, it is difficult and also wrong to say that there is currently an image that can achieve this goal. The British government is constantly consulting closely with relevant countries on events relating to their common interests, in order to obtain solutions that are fair to both sides and also take appropriate account of the interests of third countries. The British government has also notified the governments of China and Japan, informing them that the British government is prepared to use its good offices at any time and is willing to take all necessary steps when the time is appropriate. He must now admit that since he spoke in the House of Lords last December, the situation does not appear to have changed in any way on this point. He cannot consider that the time is ripe. After hearing the reply, Lord Strabolgi thanked Plymouth, and the matter was then shelved (Reuters report, 1st).

### US and Britain Closely Watching Security of Shanghai Concession; Electric Fence Around Tianjin Concession; Britain, US, and France Protest to Japan

(London) British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth said in the House of Lords today in response to Lord Strabolgi's speech that the British government has now called the Japanese government's attention to the fact that the UK is very concerned about the ongoing discussions between the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the Japanese authorities. Since the re-emergence of terrorist incidents in Shanghai, the Japanese authorities have made some suggestions to the Municipal Council, requesting that it maintain law and order more effectively. The British government is continuing to monitor the situation closely and is prepared to provide the Municipal Council with possible advice and assistance at any time. It is reported that the American ambassador has also made similar representations. Mr. Ede also said that the government deeply regrets the occurrence of such riots, but it cannot report any other news to the House of Lords. This matter is currently being discussed between the Japanese authorities in Shanghai and the Municipal Council. Mr. Plymouth also mentioned the news reported by various newspapers that the Nanjing "Reformed Government" had declared a silent war on the Public Concession and British and French ships for allegedly assisting General Chiang Kai-shek. He said that the British government had not yet received any verification of this from the British ambassador. He believes that the British government should wait until it has received information about this matter before considering the issue of making representations to Tokyo. We should not forget that the British government has not recognized the Nanjing "Reformed Government" and therefore should not attach too much importance to any statements made by that government. (Reuters report, 1st)

(London) It has been officially confirmed that the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States have protested to the Japanese authorities on the basis of humanitarianism regarding the construction of electrified barbed wire fences around the Tianjin Concession by the Japanese. (Reuters report, 2nd)

### Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, To Be Developed As Naval Port: Reactions to Japanese Occupation of the Island

(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources in Hanoi, the Vietnamese government announced on February 25th that it was closing Cam Ranh Bay. All ships except French warships are prohibited from entering. It appears that the French government is beginning to build fortifications in the bay, and its strength will be comparable to that of Singapore. (Reuters report, 2nd)

### Editorial: Reflections on Education

The National Education Conference was duly opened in Chongqing on the first of this month. It is said that there are many important cases to be decided at the meetings over the next few days. Education is a major matter relating to the entire nation and race, and relating to the modern and future generations. It is not like a professional field, nor is it merely a temporary measure. Moreover, in this era of resistance and national reconstruction, it bears the mission of inheriting the past and ushering in the future. Therefore, it is surely not just the reporter's personal wish to pray that this conference will shoulder the heavy responsibility of a century and live up to the high expectations of all parties.

What are the major issues facing Chinese education today, and how can these major issues be resolved? All these specialized questions relating to education depend on educators to use their insightful knowledge to study and answer them. We trust the experts and will not waste words on our own account. However, when education is mentioned, there are always certain reflections that rise and fall in my chest. Although I am a small and insignificant person and not involved in the education field, I can examine how the education I received at various levels in my youth and adolescence has influenced my character and behavior. I recall my school life, school discipline, the teachings of my teachers, and how the teachers influenced each other as role models. And after leaving school and entering society, how did I come to know, how did I act, and how did I learn? All this is personal experience. Decades have passed and even now, hearing the word "education" inevitably evokes endless reflections that I cannot suppress. I have witnessed relatives and fellow villagers entering school, dropping out, or graduating. The years pass and the mind and body are exhausted, and all the time there are problems. Children must be educated. Therefore, before they attend school, we choose a school, seeking one where the teachers, academic atmosphere, facilities, environment, and fees are all problem-free. And after they enter school, we worry that they will not study and that their studies will be poor, and we also worry that they will study hard but be influenced by bad habits. We rigorously correct them, but often there are problems. This again is related to education and we cannot remain indifferent, and so we cannot help but have reflections on education. Setting aside my own small self and looking elsewhere, the foreign invasion is the most serious test for the country, and the War of Resistance is the most serious test for past education, on the military, political, economic, national, and social fronts. What have we learned from this test? In the twenty months of the War of Resistance, the strengths and weaknesses of the nation and society have been fully exposed. What strengths are there that can be attributed to past education? What weaknesses are there for which past education cannot escape blame? I will not analyze this question in detail here. In short, the current situation makes people reflect without thinking on the urgent need for a thorough reform of education, so that we may have a people who can overcome the great task of recovery and restoration.

From the above, the problem is truly great. We must address it with all the knowledge and power relating to education, like a general mobilization in the military. We must implement the national education policy, like a strict and uniform military order that is swiftly executed. We must catch up urgently, like a life-or-death, win-or-lose melee. Therefore, an educational revolution is necessary to complete the transformation of the nation. This cannot be achieved by the efforts of a single hand or foot. If we seek results in the small and near, there are several points that I appeal to the general public: Those who do not have a commitment to education should not enter the education field for profit, should not enter the education field for power, should not treat it as a transition, should not treat it as a pastime, and should not enter the education field because they have extra time and energy to supplement their income, this is the first point. Those who aspire to devote themselves to education should first examine the joys and hardships of engaging in education, and understand the meaning of engaging in education. If their aspirations are insufficient, they must cultivate sufficient scholarship, and they must cultivate their character and conduct so that they can be role models. If they have any internal shame, they should not do it. This is the second point. Those who are already serving in the education field must have a spirit of contentment in poverty and perseverance, and devote themselves to it for life. They must take morality as the foundation of personality education, and they must also diligently study, always standing on the front line of scholarship. They should take education as their duty to students, and they should bear the responsibility of education to the country, and they should consider it a great shame and dereliction of duty if their students do not become successful. This is the third point. Those who are not in the education field but have a connection to the education cause should advocate for education and promote education, this goes without saying. However, they must first respect teachers, and must not damage teachers or insult education with political or commercial measures, or any other measures outside the nature of education. Nor should they entice good teachers to leave education for any reason, reason, or motive. This is the fourth point. Compared to the solemn and great issue of education as a whole, these four points may seem irrelevant, but if the general public can accept these four points, not only can the atmosphere of education be clarified, but I also deeply believe that it will be able to improve the effectiveness of education.

### The War Situation in Southern Guangdong and Central Hubei Remains Largely Unchanged; Japanese Troops in Old Sanshui Suffer Casualties in an Attack; Chinese Troops on the Hanyi Road Advance Eastward

Wengyuan: On the 28th of last month, over two hundred Japanese infantrymen from Sanshui crossed the river from Hekou and were ambushed by Chinese guerrillas near Old Sanshui, suffering heavy casualties. On the same day, over a hundred Japanese soldiers in plainclothes went to Qingtanggangtou Village to plunder grain and build fortifications. There has been a slight increase in Japanese troops in the southwest, and more than thirty tanks have been deployed. (2nd dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Since yesterday, the battles in the northeast, west, and three rivers of Guangdong Province have become calm again. Five days ago, Japanese troops in the Dongjiang area launched an eastern offensive from Shilong, Zengcheng, and other places, attempting to seize Boluo and Huiyang. After being ambushed from both the front and the rear by Chinese regular troops and guerrillas, they have now halted their eastward advance. According to foreign military observers, it is impossible for Japanese troops in South China to invade Guangxi Province in the near future because their current forces are not sufficient for an invasion of Guangxi Province. It is said that General Xia Wei, a famous general of Guangxi Province, was ordered by General Bai Chongxi a few days ago to go to the Nanlu area to inspect defense works and review his troops. (2nd Express News Agency dispatch)

(Hong Kong) According to sources from foreigners in Guangzhou, a team of Chinese air force planes bombed the Japanese airfield on Baiyun Mountain in the northern suburbs of Guangzhou on the morning of the 28th of last month and engaged in fierce air combat with Japanese planes. However, the extent of losses on both sides is unknown. (2nd Express News Agency dispatch)

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the situation in Chaoshan has become tense again in recent days. More than ten Japanese warships are currently docked between Shantou and Huilai, patrolling back and forth, and occasionally sending motorboats to harass Chinese military positions along the coast. Three days ago, a small Japanese detachment landed near Huilai but has now been repelled by Chinese troops. (2nd Express News Agency dispatch)

Zhongqun: Recently, Chinese troops have been in a dominant position on all fronts in central Hubei. Japanese troops on the Hanyi Road and at Yanmen Pass have been defeated by Chinese troops, and seven or eight Japanese armored vehicles have been destroyed. Japanese troops advancing on the Jingzhong Road are still being blocked by strong Chinese forces near Sunqiao, unable to cross the Lei Pool. Japanese troops in Sanyangdian were attacked by Chinese flanking troops in Zhou Dian, north of Sanyangdian, resulting in over four hundred Japanese casualties. Chinese troops seized many spoils of war. The Japanese troops, unable to hold out, fled to Songdengling, southeast of Luohanling. Although the Japanese troops in front of Suixian have increased by eight hundred men in the direction of Yujiadian and Xujiadian, they are still controlled by Chinese guerrillas and unable to move. Ying Shuding, the northeastern highland of Yujiadian, was recaptured by Chinese guerrillas yesterday, and over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. (2nd dispatch)

(Yichang) In the battles on all fronts in central Hubei, the Chinese side has gained an advantage recently. In the Yanmen Pass area, Chinese troops have launched attacks against the Japanese troops using mobile tactics, which have been very successful. Seven Japanese armored vehicles have been destroyed by Chinese troops. Chinese troops near Yonglong River have also advanced forward. Japanese troops in the Yangjiaze area were subjected to a surprise flanking attack by Chinese troops, and the Japanese forces are about to collapse. Japanese troops advancing on Sunqiao are harassing the rear of Huayuan Yuantai, and have been driven back by Chinese troops. Japanese troops invading Yuekou have recently transported a large amount of property from local merchants and civilians to the mainland, and many Chinese women and children have been attacked. (2nd dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Chinese troops in western Hubei are currently fighting Japanese troops along the Qian River on the Hanyi Highway and on the opposite bank of the Xiang River in Yuekou. The two wings of the Chinese troops on the north and south sides of the Hanyi Highway are moving eastward, attempting to put pressure on the two wings of the Japanese troops advancing westward along the highway. (2nd Reuters dispatch)

Shashi: Chinese guerrillas in central Hubei have recently become more active and have attacked Yingcheng, defeating over a hundred Japanese troops stationed in Yingcheng. A large number of Japanese supplies were burned, resulting in heavy losses. (1st dispatch)

(Yichang) Japanese troops in Yingshan are extremely frightened due to the fierce counter-offensive by Chinese troops. They have been forcing local Chinese laborers to build fortifications and lay landmines for days. Fearing leaks, they secretly massacred all the laborers. (1st dispatch)

(Hankou) Japanese troops attempting to advance westward are currently stalled on the Yingcheng-Jingshan Highway in central Hubei. The reason for their stagnation is that, in addition to encountering strong resistance from Chinese troops, an epidemic is spreading among the Japanese troops, with an average of 250 deaths per day. It is also reported that on the Yun River, a tributary of the Han River, Japanese troops have infiltrated the Yonglong River, 13 kilometers southeast of Jiukou Town. There have been frequent Japanese air raids in Anlu, but due to the excellent Chinese defenses, the damage has been minimal. (2nd Express News Agency dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese military sources, Japanese troops on the front line of the Hanyi Highway have retreated 15 kilometers after being counter-attacked by Chinese troops yesterday. The Yonglong River, 13 kilometers southeast of Jiukou, was briefly invaded by Japanese troops yesterday morning, but Chinese reinforcements counter-attacked and drove the Japanese troops back last night. Important strongholds such as Zhongxiang Jiukou and Duomaiwan on the east bank of the Han River are currently being firmly defended by Chinese troops. At dawn yesterday, Japanese troops who secretly crossed the Xiang River from Yuekou were mostly annihilated by Chinese troops, and the remaining troops have retreated back to Yuekou. There are no Japanese troops on the south bank of the Xiang River now. (2nd Express News Agency dispatch)

Chinese Troops Will Advance to

the Suburbs of Yangzhou

Huaiyin: Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are wealthy areas in Jiangsu Province. Since their fall, Zhenjiang has been stationed with troops for a long time because it is located on the river and is an important transportation route for the Japanese army. In July last year, a certain army's advance troops cleared the Japanese and puppet troops in Tiantushan Dagang and other places in the southwestern suburbs of Zhenjiang and extended their forces to the Jiangbei area along the river. The residents of that area began to see the light of day again. On January 11, the troops attacked Yangzhou and advanced to the suburbs. (2nd dispatch)

The results showed that 38% of the Japanese troops expressed war weariness. Most of the soldiers felt that continuing the war would be fruitless, and hoped to return to Japan as soon as possible to engage in a peaceful life. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)

### After Japanese Planes Bomb Luohu, Tanaka Apologizes to the Governor of Hong Kong; Agreement Reached on Compensation Issue; Resolution Pending Instructions from Both Sides

### Representatives of the Methodist Episcopal Church of the United States in Asia Express Deep Sympathy for China's Resistance War; Frugality in Meals and Fundraising to Actively Relieve Refugees

(Chongqing) According to diplomatic sources, the Methodist Episcopal Church of the United States in Southern Asia recently held a conference in Hyderabad, Deccan, India, and resolved to send two representatives, Reverend Mandore from India and Reverend An Qing from Burma, to China to show the Church's friendship to China. The two, along with five representatives from China attending the World Missionary Conference, set off from Yangon by car and arrived in Yunnan after eight days. They then went to Chengdu for sightseeing and arrived in Chongqing last week. The two were deeply sympathetic and admired the spirit of China's heroic self-defense war of resistance. When interviewed by reporters today, Reverend Mandore said in a sincere and excited tone, "We are deeply moved by the spirit of sacrifice and courage of the Chinese nation and the construction undertakings in the southwestern provinces. The Indian nation loves peace and good neighborliness and hates war and believes in the policy of non-violent resistance." Mr. Mandore said that the Indian nation believes that outsiders should not stand by or only offer empty sympathy for China's resistance war but should have more concrete expressions. India is a buyer of Japanese goods, so the Indian people all know that boycotting Japanese goods is enough to help China. People in Calcutta and other Indian cities have previously designated a certain day as "Aid China Day" and donated from house to house on that day to relieve Chinese refugees. The enthusiastic aid to China by Indian youth is particularly commendable, and the churches in India are working hard. Each church has held an "Aid China Week." During these seven days, the people in the church only eat vegetarian food to save money to relieve Chinese refugees. After the war of resistance, a noteworthy event occurred in the Indian cultural circles. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the famous Japanese poet Noguchi wrote to the Indian poet Tagore, saying that Japan was not fighting to conquer China, but to build Asia for Asians. Tagore immediately replied, "China is an invincible country. I am confident that the Japanese will eventually wake up from their confusion. I love the Japanese people and hope that Japan will regret its success in this war." Mr. Meng then added that India really supports China's policy of resistance, and after the last All-India Representative Congress, it sent an Indian rescue team to China to serve. Recently, the Methodist Episcopal Church of Southern Asia also resolved to urge Indians to boycott Japanese goods, and it is expected that when the next All-India Congress is held, there will be further actions. When I return to India, I will report the situation in China to Indian leaders such as Gandhi and Tagore, etc." After the interview with Mandore, the reporter had a brief conversation with the Burmese representative, Mr. An Qing. According to him, in the past 60 years, because Japan was a first-class power, Burma also regarded it as an ideal country in the Far East. The price of Japanese goods shipped to Burma was very low, which caused the prices of goods in Burma to fall. Therefore, Burmese people regarded Japan as their savior. However, today Burma has gradually lost its trust in Japan because the Burmese people know that what Japan has done is almost the same as the economic invasion of small and weak countries by other imperialist countries. As far as Burma is concerned, either be pro-British or pro-Japanese, but the Burmese people all believe that it is better to maintain their existing relationship with Britain than to be pro-Japanese. As for China, Burma is extremely sympathetic to China's resistance war. The Burmese Women's Association has donated funds to all walks of life to relieve Chinese refugees, and all Christians are also assisting China materially and spiritually. Mr. An Qing finally said that Japan has done its best to promote publicity in Burma, and even uses scholarships to encourage Burmese students to study in Japan. According to reports, after arriving in Chongqing, the two pastors, Mandore and An Qing, visited President Kong, President Sun, and Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, etc. separately. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Madam Chiang Kai-shek also scheduled a meeting. (1st dispatch)

### British and French Consuls in Tianjin File Protests with the Japanese Authorities: The City Has Become an Armed Encampment, and Such a Situation Is Unacceptable

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The British and French consuls in Tianjin have filed protests with the Japanese authorities regarding two matters: (1) The Japanese side, under the pretext of suppressing terrorist activities, has turned the Tianjin city area into an armed encampment. (2) The temporary government authorities have taken various measures in finance, including currency restrictions, which are sufficient to hinder foreign trade. According to reports, Chinese guerrillas are extremely active in Tianjin and its suburbs. The Japanese army has set up obstacles everywhere and laid barbed wire around the concessions, placing Tianjin under a terrifying police system. The British and French consuls all believe that such a situation is unacceptable for long. In addition, the US consul in Tianjin has also filed a protest with the Japanese authorities, based primarily on human rights concepts. (2nd dispatch)

Currently, various banks and Fu Dian Bank have proceeded to invest, and Fu Dian Bank has opened a silkworm factory. (1st dispatch)

### Sino-Burmese Test Flight Arrives in Kunming; Five British Pilots in Total; Warmly Welcomed by Yunnan People

Kunming: The British Royal Aviation Company Sino-Burmese test flight took off from Laojia at 8:40 this morning and arrived in Kunming at 11:40 am. There were a total of five people accompanying the plane, all of whom were British. The aviation industry here believes that this aircraft is the first to come to China and the first test flight of the Sino-Burmese air route by the British side, so they all went to the airport to welcome it and present flowers. The situation was extremely warm. Eurasia and China Aviation companies also held tea parties to entertain them in the morning and afternoon. Now that the aircraft captain and others have completed their work in Yunnan, they are scheduled to fly back to Yangon on the morning of the 3rd. (2nd dispatch)

(Kunming) Moore, the representative of the British Royal Aviation Company in China, previously came to Kunming from Chongqing to negotiate Sino-Burmese air traffic matters. Now that the matter has been completed, he is scheduled to fly to Hanoi on the 3rd. (2nd dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to news here today, the China Aviation Company and the Eurasia Aviation Company are now experiencing a shortage of passenger planes. The China Aviation Company currently only has four Douglas jumbo transports, three of which are damaged and are being repaired. Although the Eurasia Aviation Company still has three or four Jumbo Junkers planes, due to difficult circumstances, only one is currently flying in mainland China, and most of the others are small, old-fashioned ones. The reason for this is that the southwest of China often has heavy dew in winter, and the airport surfaces are not flat, so they are easily damaged. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)

(London) Aviation Minister Wood recently included a statement in the 1939-40 air force budget, explaining the development of the British aviation industry, and said that the Chinese and British governments are negotiating the opening of a regular air service between British Burma and Yunnan Province, China, and an agreement has been reached.

Hainan Island

American Nationals Safe

(Manila) Today, the American warship John Edwards arrived here from Hainan Island via Hong Kong. According to officials on the ship, all American nationals on Hainan Island are currently safe. It is reported that the ship sailed to Haikou not long after the Japanese army occupied Hainan Island. According to officials on the ship, they saw two Japanese destroyers anchored in the bay, and 1,000 Japanese marines were temporarily stationed on the beach. Personnel on the ship did not see any fighting, which is sufficient to indicate that the occupation of Haikou did not offer the Japanese army any strong resistance. The ship stayed in Haikou for three days before arriving here via Hong Kong. (Associated Press, 2nd dispatch)

### New Pope of Rome, Pacelli Elected, Title is Pius XII, Tens of Thousands Crowd St. Peter's Square

Vatican City - Papal Secretary of State Pacelli was elected Pope today, taking the title Pius XII. Pacelli has served as Secretary of State for nine years. (February 2nd, Associated Press dispatch)

Vatican City - Thirty-five thousand people gathered in St. Peter's Square today, all eyes fixed on the sixty-foot-high chimney. The smoke emerging from the chimney would indicate that a new Pope had been chosen. A high platform was specially built at a location easily visible from the square to broadcast the news via radio. At 10 a.m., a wisp of black smoke rose, indicating that the first ballot had not produced a candidate. A second ballot was held at 11:28 a.m. The black smoke indicated that this ballot was also inconclusive, as no one had received the necessary two-thirds majority. When the black smoke appeared, some in the crowd, unable to clearly distinguish the color, thought the first plume looked white and began to cheer. Minutes later, when the smoke turned black, they were disappointed. A total of four ballots will be cast today. After lunch, private meetings were held in the chambers below, discussing the leading archbishops from this morning's ballots and the significant changes regarding those who seemed likely to be elected candidates. Archbishops who did not wish to meet with other archbishops had wooden barriers erected outside their doors, forming a St. Andrew's cross pattern. (February 2nd, Reuters dispatch)

(Rome) - The Papal Conclave of sixty-two cardinals held its first ballot this morning at 9:30 a.m. Large crowds stood in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, watching for the white smoke signal that would announce the election.

Spy Arrests

Japan Protests to Britain

(London) - According to sources here, Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sawada yesterday lodged a strong protest with British Ambassador Craigie regarding "British mistreatment of Japanese residents in Singapore." The so-called mistreatment refers to the arrest by Singapore authorities of Japanese residents suspected of espionage. Well-informed sources here point out that the Japanese Ambassador to Britain had previously protested to the British government about this matter, and the British government immediately promised to begin an investigation, which has not yet been completed.

### Italy and Poland Uphold Common Interests, Promote Friendly Cooperation, Italy Attempts to Alienate France and Poland, Foreign Minister Ciano's Trip Fails

Warsaw - Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, having completed his reciprocal visit to Poland, departed from Krakow last night with his wife and entourage to return home. Yesterday morning, Ciano visited the tomb of the late President Pilsudski to lay a wreath. In the afternoon, he attended a banquet at the Wawel Royal Castle at the invitation of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. (February 2nd, Haitong dispatch)

Warsaw - Regarding the visit of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the Polish government issued a communique before Minister Ciano's departure, stating, "Both sides solemnly declare that the policies they pursue are based on order and justice, and that they will continue to promote friendly cooperation in accordance with their common interests." (February 1st, Havas dispatch)

(Paris) - Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Warsaw was intended to persuade Poland to remain neutral between France and Italy, so that Italy could act as it wished in the Mediterranean without worries. However, the results were not as desired. The French newspapers expressed their relief upon hearing the news. (February 2nd, Havas dispatch)

Warsaw - During Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Poland, the anti-German demonstrations by Polish university students were the most intriguing. Although this movement could not be seen as hostile to Italy, it was still embarrassing that the students' opposition was directed at Beck's policies, even though Foreign Minister Beck was hosting Foreign Minister Ciano. Italy had hoped that a warm atmosphere would be spontaneously created in Warsaw upon Minister Ciano's arrival, as is common in totalitarian countries, but this did not happen, which was unexpected. It is reported that Ciano discussed three issues during his visit: first, Poland's relationship with the German-Italian axis; second, the Danube River region issue; and third, Italy's territorial demands. Regarding the first point, Foreign Minister Beck had clearly stated, before the anti-German demonstrations occurred, that Polish foreign policy had always maintained a detached position towards all totalitarian blocs. Before Ciano's visit, he also announced that he would travel to London in early March, possibly followed by a trip to Paris. Regarding the second point, it is difficult to precisely define the policies of Poland and Italy in Central Europe. Certain newspapers of the Polish detachment faction claimed that since Germany and Austria had merged, Germany's influence in Hungary had also increased, and Italy's position in Central Europe had weakened, making it difficult to pursue any ambitions. Moreover, Berlin regards Central Europe as Germany's exclusive domain, making it difficult for Poland and Italy to intervene. Regarding the third point, Poland's attitude was extremely ambiguous. Foreign Minister Ciano repeatedly raised the issue of redistributing world colonies, but Foreign Minister Beck remained silent and noncommittal. He repeatedly emphasized the continued validity of the Franco-Polish alliance treaty, leaving no room for doubt. In short, Foreign Minister Ciano's trip was unsuccessful, and the Italian government and public opinion should therefore adopt a cautious attitude. (February 2nd, Havas dispatch)

### Japanese Military Supplementary Budget Exceeds 5.2 Billion Yen, Based on Ability to Confront China and Russia Simultaneously, Issuance of Bonds Unbearable for the People

(Tokyo) - The Japanese Cabinet has approved a supplementary budget for the army and navy totaling 5,270,000,000 yen, of which 4,600,000,000 yen will cover the expenses of the China Incident from February 1939 to March 1940. This budget is based on the so-called "two-power standard," as Japan aims to be fully prepared to confront China and the Soviet Union simultaneously if necessary. The army's expenses are 3,140,000,000 yen, the navy's expenses are 810,000,000 yen, with 650,000,000 yen allocated as a reserve fund and the remaining 670,000,000 yen included in the supplementary recurring budget, of which 490,000,000 yen will be allocated to the army and 180,000,000 yen to the navy. It is said that these funds will be used to strengthen general national defense. The Asahi Shimbun elaborates on this budget, stating that bonds worth 2,456,000,000 yen have not yet been issued for this year, and the issuance of bonds next year will reach 5,732,000,000 yen. Since August 1937, the total expenses for the China Incident have exceeded 11,990,000,000 yen, which is seven times greater than the cost of the Russo-Japanese War. (February 2nd, Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) - According to the Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun," based on the government's proposed supplementary national defense budget yesterday, Japan's total expenditure on the war in China has reached 11,990,000,000,000 yen. In other words, every Japanese citizen, regardless of age or gender, bears a burden of 120 yen. (February 1st, Haitong dispatch)

### Conference of Japanese Envoys to Europe Held in Berlin, Discussing Expansion of German-Italian-Japanese Alliance, To Counter the Democratic Nations' Front

(London) - According to today's News Chronicle, several Japanese ambassadors and ministers will meet in Berlin tomorrow to discuss how to draft an alliance between Italy, Germany, and Japan, aimed at confronting Britain and France (or including the United States) rather than solely targeting the Soviet Union. Japan is currently organizing an iron front against the Soviet Union and democratic nations for self-defense, to avoid the consequences of reckless military action in China. Efforts in this regard have recently become more active, but the European Axis powers seem to be wavering on the suitability of forming an alliance. According to sources of Reuters in London, if this meeting takes place, it is unlikely to have special significance. Neither the Japanese Embassy nor other sources know about this meeting. The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu, will not be going to Berlin. Shigemitsu is an important figure in Japanese diplomatic circles, and since he is not making this trip, the meeting is unlikely to discuss issues as significant as reported by the News Chronicle. Sources in various Japanese circles say that the mission of the three officials who were scheduled to leave Japan for Europe at the end of January to discuss the final steps of converting the anti-communist pact into a formal military alliance is unrelated to this issue. Furthermore, according to sources in London, it is not a special event for Japanese diplomats in Europe to hold a meeting for ordinary matters. The general sentiment in London is that, regardless of the wishes of other Axis powers (about which there is no news at present), Japan is particularly unwilling to take on any responsibilities in European disputes, as this seems more harmful than beneficial.

### Osaka Armory Explosion, Mayeda Town Reduced to Ashes, Over 500 Dead and Injured, 900 Houses Destroyed, Tens of Thousands of Nearby Residents Homeless

(Tokyo) - Yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out at the Japanese Army armory in Mayeda, Osaka, followed by a series of explosions that lasted for four hours, making the area near the armory extremely dangerous.

According to Ms. Uchida, 24, "At 3 p.m., I was walking from the station to Hirakata when I saw a thick plume of black smoke rising from the hilltop to my left. I was asking a passerby what it was when I heard a deafening explosion. The doors and windows of nearby shops were shattered. I was very scared and ran back." The continuous explosions caused extreme panic among the people throughout the West Kyoto-Osaka area. (February 2nd, Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) - Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Minister of War Itagaki stated in the House of Representatives today that he regretted the explosion at the armory near Osaka. However, the military operations of the Japanese army at the front will not be hindered by this explosion. Although there is nothing to be gleaned from this, it is sufficient to show that the explosion must have a background. (February 2nd, dispatch)

Kobe - The Hirakata armory between Kyoto and Osaka suddenly exploded yesterday (February 1st) at 3 p.m., reducing almost the entire town to ashes and causing enormous loss of life and property.

(Tokyo) - According to today's official report, the result of yesterday's explosion at the Osaka Hirakata Army armory was 22 dead, 569 injured, and 153 missing. After the fire broke out at the armory at 2:40 p.m. yesterday, the explosions continued for four hours. It is known that 6 army personnel were killed, 50 were injured, and 2 were missing. The rest were civilians. It is reported that 3 policemen rescued 30 armory workers from the fire and then disappeared. Another policeman was seriously injured. Within a mile radius of the armory, 800 houses were completely destroyed and 100 were partially destroyed. According to a statement from the Tokyo Ministry of the Army, the Hirakata armory caught fire at 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, and an investigation into the cause of the fire immediately began. It is evident that the fire was caused by carelessness in handling explosives. The Ministry of the Army has dispatched Vice Minister Yamawaki to lead a team of rescuers to the disaster area. Hirakata Town has a population of 27,160 and 5,950 houses. When the fire was raging, it threatened to destroy everything, but a large infantry battalion, a company of engineers, 1,000 policemen dispatched from Osaka, and 200 firefighters rushed to put out the fire, which was extinguished late last night. Within 50 minutes of the incident, the authorities ordered all residents of the town to evacuate immediately. The victims took refuge in Osaka and other places, and the injured were sent to the army hospitals and Red Cross hospitals in Osaka and other places. According to police reports this morning, 8,313 victims took refuge in Osaka and 813 in Kyoto. The Osaka Army authorities have distributed 3,000 blankets and 30,000 military hardtack to the victims.

### French Foreign Minister Attends the House of Representatives, Reports on the International Situation, Willing to Negotiate with Italy Within the Scope of the Agreement, Situation in Central and Eastern Europe Gradually Improves

(Paris) - Foreign Minister Bonnet attended the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives this afternoon and presented reports on Hainan Island (see separate dispatch), Spain, Italy's territorial demands, Central and Eastern Europe, and the United States' sale of aircraft to France. The main points are as follows:

Regarding the Spanish issue, Foreign Minister Bonnet first explained the circumstances surrounding the French government's decision to recognize the Nationalist government. He stated that Senator Peyral's discussions with the Nationalist government authorities had resulted in an agreement, and both sides would establish good-neighborly relations. General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, would issue a reply to the British and French governments, providing assurances on maintaining independence and refraining from retaliatory measures against Republican government personnel. General Franco has reportedly instructed General Gambara, commander of the Italian volunteer forces, to have the Italian volunteer forces leave Spain as soon as possible. General Gambara has returned to Rome to report to the government. Foreign Minister Jordana of the Nationalist government has also assured Peyral that Italian and German combatants would withdraw from Spain. As for the Republican government, several leaders, including certain military officers, have agreed to quickly end the civil war.

Regarding Italy's territorial demands, Britain and France have a joint relationship and a completely consistent attitude. This can be seen from the recent statements made to Parliament by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Minister Halifax. France is still prepared to reopen negotiations with Italy within the scope of the January 7, 1935, Franco-Italian agreement. This position has not changed.

Regarding the issues in Central and Eastern Europe, the situation in these areas has improved, and France's influence in Yugoslavia, Poland, and Romania has also increased. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck told Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday that Poland would remain steadfast in its commitment to the Franco-Polish alliance treaty. Ciano's trip was unsuccessful, and the Italian government was disappointed.

Regarding the issue of the United States selling a large number of aircraft to France, President Roosevelt's position is extremely important. (February 1st, Havas dispatch)

Italian Reservists

Called Up for Enlistment

Actively Training Youth

Joining the Air Force

Rome - A proclamation was issued here today calling up reservists from the 1915 to 1918 classes. It is estimated that 60,000 to 200,000 people will be affected. According to official statements, this call-up is routine, affecting the entire 1918 class and other three classes who were deemed unqualified and refused enlistment in previous years. According to foreign sources, the only reason for Italy's sudden call-up of four classes of reservists is the need to maintain military quotas. It should be noted that the number of people in the classes called up after this is very small due to the low birth rate during the war. According to population statistics, 435,000 boys were born in 1915, 377,000 in 1916, 231,000 in 1917, 240,000 in 1918, and 274,000 in 1939. (February 2nd, Reuters dispatch)

It can be said that the occasion was a grand one. Prime Minister Chamberlain's attendance at the Soviet Embassy banquet in his capacity as leader of the Conservative Party is unprecedented since the establishment of the Soviet regime. The local newspapers, regardless of party affiliation, have attached great importance to this and stated that this is further evidence of the rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union. It also shows that Prime Minister Chamberlain is not swayed by ideological differences. (February 2nd, Havas)

### General Pétain Appointed French Ambassador to Spain, Morale of Spanish Nationalist Army Boosted, Civil War May Reignite

(Paris) - The Council of Ministers recently decided to appoint General Pétain, a renowned general from the European War, as Ambassador to the Spanish Nationalist government. (February 2nd, Havas dispatch)

(Paris) - General Pétain is 83 years old this year. It is reported that the Cabinet asked him to come out of retirement to be the first Ambassador to the Spanish Nationalist government. He initially declined due to his age, but Prime Minister Daladier repeatedly urged him, explaining the importance of the mission and that he could not do without his help. Pétain finally agreed. Pétain joined the army in 1876 and held important positions in the military. He gained widespread fame during the European War and was promoted to Chief of the General Staff of the French Army in 1917. He was later promoted to the rank of Marshal. After the end of the war, he was promoted to the rank of General. With such a brilliant career, it is no wonder Daladier repeatedly urged him to take on the role. (February 2nd, Haitong dispatch)

(Paris) - The Paris Evening News recently speculated that the Spanish Civil War may reignite, citing a statement by Foreign Minister Vayá of the Republican government that the soldiers on the front lines of the Republican army are very disciplined and orderly, and their morale is therefore strong. According to Vayá, everyone, both at the front and in the rear, is able to fulfill their responsibilities, so there is no need to worry about the future of the war. Vayá also invited reporters to visit the front lines of the army to prove the truth of his words. (February 2nd, Haitong dispatch)

### U.S. Air Force Strength Unmatched by Other Nations; Production Can Be Increased to a Thousand Aircraft Per Month; Army Air Corps Greatly Expanded

(Washington) According to the testimony given by Army Air Corps Deputy Chief Arnold to the Senate Military Committee today, the United States can have a very large air force in the event of war. He said that the new fighter planes currently possessed by the United States are not only able to compete with the superior fighter planes of any country, but their speed is even higher than that of any other country's fighter planes. At the same time, in terms of the current aircraft production capacity of the United States, at least 12,000 aircraft can be produced annually. The newest U.S. fighter plane is the XFM-1, which has multiple seats and is produced by the Bayer Aircraft Factory. The manufacturing rights have never been sold to any foreign country. (United Press dispatch, 1st)

(Washington) A congressional committee today released information about the strength and plans of the U.S. Air Force, stating that the U.S. Army has 879 assorted first-line military aircraft. In an emergency, it would take three years to increase U.S. aircraft production to 1,000 per month. Generally, this number is considered to be the aircraft production of Germany. Air Force Chief Major General Arnold declared today that the War Department plans to use annual appropriations, including funds requested by President Roosevelt, to purchase 565 assorted new aircraft. New explosives and aircraft made of adhesive materials are currently being tested, with the hope that this material will eventually enable the United States to continuously manufacture aircraft like concrete. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

(Washington) Secretary of War Woodring recently declared that the U.S. Army Air Corps has been greatly expanded, and specifically transferred Army Air Corps Chief Major General Arnold to be the commander of the Army Air Forces, with all officers and soldiers of the national Army Air Corps under his command.

American Constitution

Grants the President the Power to Declare War

Hull Opposes Amendment

(Washington) Twelve senators recently proposed a constitutional amendment to abolish the president's power to declare war and instead have it decided by a public referendum. Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to the newspapers, expressing his opposition. He stated, "Regarding the prevention of the United States from being involved in the vortex of war," after careful study by the founding fathers, it was believed that only a government that could truly represent public opinion was a proper solution. This view is extremely wise and suitable for the times, and past experience can serve as proof. Indiana Democratic Congressman Ludlow previously proposed the same motion, which was decided by the House last January to not be brought up for discussion.

British Air Force Budget

Total Exceeds 200 Million Pounds

### General Göring States Germany is Expanding Air Force with Full Strength; German Dictionary Contains No Word "Fear"; Sharpening Swords to Prepare to Cut Down the Enemy

(Berlin) German General Göring gave a speech to military leaders and party members today, saying, "We must manufacture aircraft so that they are unimaginable to others in terms of both quality and quantity." Other notable quotes from Göring's speech included, "We must sharpen our swords to serve the safety of the German people," "The German dictionary contains no word for 'fear'," and "The German Air Force still needs great efforts in 1939." Göring also stated that he always believed that if the German people were given proper leadership and all their energy was focused on what was necessary, they could be "absolutely invincible." Because of the awareness of being able to rely on this military force, Hitler has the strength to resolve major national responsibilities with calm confidence and demand the unshakeable rights that the German nation should have. We can look beyond our borders and find several major countries with extreme arrogance, considering themselves protectors of culture, but in reality, they are all experiencing extreme military rearmament. Although the speeches of many politicians are filled with words of peace, Christianity, and good neighborliness, and undoubtedly, democracy, they are in fact devoting all their efforts to massive rearmament. To enable Germany to achieve the necessary starting point in the air force, we must first seek self-sufficiency in materials that foreign countries are unwilling to supply to Germany in the required quantities.

### Hong Kong Feels Threatened; British Increase Border Defenses; Authorities Issue Naval Defense Ordinance

Hong Kong Correspondence: In the past week, Japanese troops invading Guangdong have continuously threatened the Hong Kong border. Those familiar with the international and Far East situation should be able to understand the motives and purposes behind this. The recent situation in Hong Kong is recorded below:

Border Situation: Since the Japanese troops suddenly attacked Nantou, which is connected to the Kowloon border, from the Taiping area of the Pearl River Estuary during the Lunar New Year, and sent aircraft to bomb Shenzhen, the British government has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese side. Therefore, the Japanese troops attacking Nantou retreated after looting. However, according to news on the 20th, hundreds of Japanese troops occupied Nantou on that morning and set fire to the county government and various agencies. Fortunately, the women and children in the city had already been evacuated, so there were fewer casualties. At the same time, the customs officials stationed there also completely retreated into British territory. Moreover, Japanese aircraft have been hovering and bombing Shenzhen in the skies above Shenzhen, causing the residents of Shenzhen to flee completely, and even residents on the British side have moved to other places. Judging from this, it can be seen that the Japanese military's threat to Hong Kong is purely a planned action and will not be restrained by British negotiations and protests.

Live-Fire Exercises: Therefore, although the Hong Kong military authorities are trying their best to remain calm and patient, they have issued orders to the border guards stationed in the New Territories to begin various preparations in order to prevent any eventuality. If necessary, they can take self-defense actions. After receiving the order, the border guards have complied with everything. Therefore, since yesterday, the situation at the various key points on the border between China and Britain in the New Territories has been tense. At the same time, the artillery batteries are also conducting exercises day and night. On the afternoon of the 25th, from 6:00 PM to midnight, the Pak Sha Wan battery held a large-scale live-fire exercise, with the sound of cannons booming, as if the God of War had descended. According to news reports, London has also recently issued a "Hong Kong Naval Defense Ordinance," authorizing the British Admiralty, when necessary, to accept the Hong Kong government's request to mobilize the Hong Kong Naval Volunteer Force to formally join the British Navy, just like the British regular navy, in order to strengthen Hong Kong's naval combat power.

Japanese Troops Attempt to Spy on Central Qiongzhou

Guangxi Troops Ordered to Deploy in Qinzhou and Lianzhou

Xuwen and Other Counties Have Declared Martial Law

The war in Qiongzhou is still in chaos. For strategic reasons, the Chinese army lured the Japanese troops deeper. It is reported that over a thousand Japanese troops, infantry and cavalry, have occupied Fushan and are attempting to spy on central Qiongzhou. However, the deeper they go, the more difficulties they will encounter. According to refugees from Qiongzhou, the Chinese army on Qiongzhou still maintains considerable strength. The self-defense corps and able-bodied men from various counties have gathered in various strategic areas, waiting for the enemy in a relaxed manner, using the mountainous terrain to fight, reducing the effectiveness of the Japanese air force and tanks. At the same time, the Chinese army has made full preparations in advance, with sufficient food and ammunition.

Qiongshan and Other Counties Are Scorched Earth

The current plan of the Japanese troops invading Qiongzhou is to first occupy the coastal ports to cut off the Chinese army's supplies. Therefore, they have landed successively in Haikou City, Yulin Port, and Qinglan Port. One force in Qinglan Port is currently invading Jiaji City in Qiongdong County. After fierce counterattacks by the Chinese army, they have been unable to make progress. In Qiongshan, Chengmai, and other counties where the Japanese troops have arrived, they have carried out large-scale looting. Refugees on the road have been subjected to inhuman air attacks by Japanese planes. No fewer than 500 people were shot to death during the evacuation of the people of Haikou, causing corpses to pile up along the roadsides, with no one to collect them. Haikou City used to be a prosperous area. Now, under the iron heels of the Japanese army, 70% to 80% of the residents have scattered and fled, and the city is desolate. Although the Japanese troops have instigated traitors to organize a puppet maintenance association, due to the obstruction of land transportation, ships that usually sail from various places to Haikou have also completely stopped running, causing food shortages and disrupting news. Citizens who were unable to leave Haikou for a time have moved to other places one after another. The county towns of Qiongshan, Wenchang, and Ding'an have been bombed by Japanese planes, and many civilian houses and shops have been destroyed by fire. Commerce has come to a standstill, and various market towns have fallen into chaos. Some refugees have detoured to Beihai, and then taken ships to Guangzhou Bay or Tokyo Bay, while others have fled to Hong Kong and Macau.

Various Counties Under Martial Law Evacuate Population

Recently, the Japanese navy, army, and air force have repeatedly reinforced their forces in Hainan. It is estimated that there are no fewer than 40 Japanese gunboats, cruisers, and transport ships, two aircraft carriers, one flagship, and no fewer than 20,000 marines and Taiwanese conscripted troops. The Qiongzhou Strait has become controlled by the Japanese army. Haikou City faces the Leizhou Peninsula. With the loss of Haikou, Xuwen County in the Leizhou Strait is under severe threat from the Japanese air force. Even the various seaports belonging to Haikang County are in a state of fear. The county authorities of various counties have been ordered to issue martial law orders, evacuate people, relocate grain, destroy roads, and increase sentries along the coast. Xuwen County, because it is close to Qiongzhou Island, has the largest population evacuation, with nine out of ten shops empty. The urban and rural areas are maintained by self-defense corps and strong men, and the coastal surveillance is very strict. All inbound travelers must undergo strict inspection before being allowed to enter. As for Japanese planes flying to Xuwen for reconnaissance, there is almost no day that they do not appear. There are more than a dozen places inside and outside the city that have been bombed, and the disaster area is vast.

Qinzhou and Lianzhou Are Tense, Guangxi Troops Reinforce

In addition, due to the fall of Qiongzhou Island, the two prefectures of Qinzhou and Lianzhou, which have lost their shields, have recently become tense again. Some Japanese warships and aircraft have been constantly observing Beihai and other places. Several Japanese warships once sailed to the sea near Guantouling and opened fire, and the next day, Japanese cruisers sailed to the sea of Qinzhou County to survey the waterways. The Qinzhou and Lianzhou defenders have recently stepped up their alert. The Guangxi provincial authorities, believing that Qinzhou and Lianzhou are close to the Guangxi border and that if there is an emergency there, Nanning and other places will be affected, specially transferred elite troops from Guangxi yesterday to Qinzhou and Lianzhou to reinforce the defenses. The Qinzhou County highway has already been dug in sections, and key points such as Guangxi are guarded by mechanized units. As for the Beihai coast, which is easily within range of Japanese naval guns, the authorities have made adequate preparations. In recent days, although ships from Beihai to Hong Kong have been traveling as usual, the number of passengers has decreased, and even fewer goods are being transported. Ships sailing from Hong Kong to Beihai now do not pass through the Qiongzhou Haikou, and only transport a small amount of meat when they arrive in Beihai, for the daily use of Hong Kong.

Affected by Military Affairs in South China, Hong Kong Trade Declines from Prosperity

Eight Strange Aircraft Invade the Skies Above Hong Kong and Kowloon

Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the Japanese army invaded South China and surrounded Hong Kong on all sides, this colony of the British Empire in the recent Far East has been greatly threatened. More recently, due to the landing of the Japanese army on Hainan Island, the value of Hong Kong in the British Far East militarily and economically has also been greatly reduced. During the Lunar New Year, Japanese troops and aircraft constantly invaded the border and airspace of Hong Kong, and even openly dropped bombs and bombed trains within the British border. The occurrence of this incident clearly shows that the Japanese side intends to demonstrate to Britain and exert military pressure on Hong Kong. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided, and another has risen. According to reliable sources, at 3:00 AM on February 2nd, eight strange aircraft suddenly flew over the skies of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and a tense situation suddenly appeared invisibly.

Stepping Up Air Defense

According to sources from relevant parties, around 3:00 AM on the deep night of the 22nd, a series of rattling sounds were heard in the skies above Hong Kong and Kowloon, which was very clear. Immediately, some people witnessed eight aircraft flying in formation in the clouds. After a few minutes, the shadows of the aircraft disappeared. At that time, more people saw them in Kowloon. As a result, the news spread, and those who heard it all determined that these eight strangely aircraft of unknown origin were undoubtedly Japanese aircraft. People have always believed that Hong Kong's air defenses are foolproof. Now, these strange aircraft have invaded for no reason. The authorities and the police have kept silent about this matter on the one hand, and denied it on the other, fearing that this would shake people's hearts and plunge society into unrest. However, the air defense authorities, led by Director Stilwell Perkins, issued a public statement in the newspapers, stating that Hong Kong's air defense equipment is being stepped up for deployment. Seven of the latest alarm machines have also been shipped from the United Kingdom and will soon be installed on suitable buildings in Hong Kong and Kowloon. It was also said that in the near future, there will be another blackout. The ulterior motives are very obvious.

Commercial Decline

The heavy military threats have made the people of Hong Kong very uneasy. At the same time, the economic impact has also become increasingly severe due to the Japanese army's occupation of Guangzhou and the invasion of Qiongyai. The prosperity of Hong Kong's commerce depends entirely on the transportation along the coast of South China. Since the outbreak of the war in South China, Hong Kong's import trade has suffered a serious blow since transportation between Hong Kong and various places has been obstructed. This shows that there is no market for British and American goods in South China. According to the trade statistics released by the Hong Kong authorities a few days ago, the total value of Hong Kong's imports in January 1939 (this year) was 40.07 million yuan, a difference of 23 million yuan compared to the total value of imports of 63.7 million yuan in the same period of 1938 (last year). As for exports, because Hong Kong merchants sold off their accumulated inventory from last year at low prices this year, the total value was 40.2 million yuan, an increase of 2 million yuan compared to 39.41 million yuan in the same period last year. However, the export amount to various parts of China was only 2.3 million yuan, a decrease of 8 million yuan compared to 10.5 million yuan in the same period last year. This is also sufficient to show that the foreign goods transported from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland in January of this year have sharply decreased. At the same time, Hong Kong's imports from South China in January only amounted to 4.9 million yuan, a decrease of more than 60% compared to the same period last year. Recently, the Japanese army invaded Qiongyai and has attempted to invade Beihai in northern Guangdong. If the war in Beihai continues, Hong Kong's trade with the mainland will be completely cut off. Therefore, according to observations from relevant parties, Hong Kong's commerce this year will decline rapidly, and it is very likely that it will return to the sluggish situation of three years ago. Therefore, the tragic economic fate of Hong Kong at present is no different from the military threats it is experiencing.

Japanese Troops Attack Zhangyan

Stalemate at Baziqiao

Jiaxing Correspondence: In recent days, the Chinese army has counterattacked Pinghu, threatening Jiaxing, which the Japanese army regards as a major problem. The commander of the Japanese army garrison in Songjiang summoned the Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, and puppet governors to discuss the siege. On the 28th of last month, the Japanese troops from Qingpu, Songjiang, and Jinshan took seven wooden-hulled motorboats pulled by Japanese ships and set off towards Zhangyan. Unexpectedly, at the Baziqiao area, which is four or five miles away from Zhangyan, the Chinese army's Ding and Shen divisions bravely resisted, and stray bullets hit two innocent farmers on the spot, all of whom were killed. There were also many injuries. The stalemate continued for two days and nights without retreat. The villages around Baziqiao were set on fire by the Japanese army. The Chen family's dozens of buildings were destroyed in the fire. Now, Japanese troops have also arrived in Tinglin, Songyin, Hougang, and Yexie, attempting to attack Xincang Town, but the Chinese army has sufficient strength, so the Japanese army has made no progress so far.

Fierce Fighting Outside Changxing

Changxing Correspondence: Yu Shuluan, who once served as the magistrate of Jiashan and Linhai Counties, is currently the magistrate of Changxing County and commander of the Anti-Japanese Guard. On the 24th of last month, he led his troops, together with the Wang regiment, bravely recaptured Mopan Mountain, seized two mountain cannons and five heavy machine guns, and resolutely defended against the Japanese army's attack. After the Chinese army defeated the invading Japanese troops, five Japanese soldiers were killed, and their corpses were taken away during the retreat and cremated in the open space in front of the former county government. Taking advantage of the victory, the Chinese army advanced to Shangliqiao, four miles away from Changxing County. The Japanese army in Changxing had only a hundred or so men, and the command post was located in Zhongshan Park. Thirty or so traitors, including Song Zhonglin, were sent in disguise to scout the movements of the Chinese army outside the city. Five of them were captured by the Chinese army and beheaded as a warning to the public. The Wuchang Highway, which connects to the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, has been destroyed by the Chinese army.

Puppet Troops Loot Xitang

Jiashan Correspondence: Xitang is the transportation center of the Jiashan waterway. Since Zhou City was set on fire by the Japanese army, the Xitang market has been abnormally prosperous. An ordinary store that usually has 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in business now has as much as 300,000 yuan. This has made it coveted by bandits. On Lunar New Year's Eve, the puppet troops of Cao Xianglin's unit carried out a full-scale looting of Xitang Town. The rice shops in Beizha, Wolong Bridge, and Mihangdai suffered the heaviest losses. Some wealthy merchants in the area have already moved elsewhere to take refuge.

Shanghai Women's Primary School Enthusiastically Donates

The Shanghai Women's Primary School, attached to the Shanghai Women's High School on Xin Da Gu Road in this city, has always strongly supported various charitable causes. Whether it is the frugality donation or the refugee relief funds, the school has always done its best to raise funds. Now that the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Education Group is raising funds for refugee productive education expenses, the students of the school, upon hearing this, have once again competed to donate. It is reported that as of yesterday, they had raised 360 yuan in national currency.

Preparing for Agricultural and Industrial Schools

Agricultural and industrial vocational education in Sichuan Province had already achieved some scale before the war. Since the relocation of the National Government to Chongqing, talent has concentrated, and in the universities, the agricultural and industrial colleges of National Central University and National Sichuan University are dedicated to agricultural and industrial vocational education. It is learned that after the establishment of Xikang Province, in response to practical needs, agricultural and industrial vocational education is highly valued. Preparations are now underway to establish agricultural and industrial schools.

Shanghai Education Sector: Opinions on Education Reform

### Some Opinions on the Reform of Secondary Education After the War (II) by Zhang Wenchang

Secondly, due to the inevitable economic difficulties faced by most parents, in addition to reducing fees and increasing the number of public-funded, free, and work-study positions, it is also possible to implement a semester system that divides the year into four seasons. Except for the six-week summer season for remedial studies, the remaining autumn, winter, and spring seasons each consist of fourteen weeks. Based on my experience in running a short-term experimental class at the East China United Middle School from May to July last year, fourteen weeks are sufficient to complete the academic program of a regular semester. The current circular curriculum of six years in senior and junior high school is wasteful and repetitive. For example, there is a lot of repetition in the teaching materials of history, geography, science, arithmetic, and Chinese. If it can be reorganized, going from shallow to deep, eliminating the complicated and adopting the essential, adding contemporary materials, and allocating the material for a 20-week semester into 14 weeks, focusing on practice, application, and experimentation, then the gains will not lead to the drawbacks of rote memorization. In previous years, some key figures in the National Government proposed abolishing vacations and shortening the length of the academic year. The Ministry of Education ordered a small number of middle schools to experiment with completing six years of middle school in five years. Now, shortening the years of study aligns with the common desire. It is appropriate to use a semester system instead of a term system in post-war China, where funding is limited and the demand for talent is urgent, so that six years of middle school can be completed in four years. If there are a few with lower proficiency, repeating a grade would only be for one semester, which is also very economical in terms of time. If there are one or two subjects failed, remedial lessons could be taken in the summer and re-examined.

Thirdly, vocational education is more necessary due to the urgent need for construction. Therefore, in addition to the vocational departments in higher education, secondary schools also need to train a large number of lower-level cadres in the vocational world. However, it is very difficult to achieve satisfactory facilities and teachers in vocational schools. This point can be remedied by using a work-study system. Utilizing the equipment and technicians of factories, farms, and hospitals can solve the difficulties of equipment and teachers. Factories that obtain these apprentice-style students will be more satisfied and familiar when recruiting them as staff in the future. Schools can still have ordinary foundational subjects and vocational theory subjects to connect theory with practice. Advanced students can receive some wages or benefits to offset living expenses, thereby reducing the burden on parents. The length of this type of school can be slightly longer, but practical experience can be greatly increased. After graduation, there will not be no other options besides pursuing further education. Fourthly, the effectiveness of basic tool subjects such as Chinese, English, and arithmetic in today's secondary schools is very low. The reason is that the goals are complex, the materials are too difficult, and there is too little practice, resulting in a downward trend. Apart from the selection of teaching materials, the lack of self-study time and the inappropriateness of guidance, or even the absence of guidance, are also reasons. For example, the current half-day system. The way to remedy this is to implement strict and precise self-study tutoring. There are two methods. One is to concentrate half a day on tutoring (the other half day for classes), scheduling self-study time for major subjects, with subject teachers rotating in grades and groups to provide guidance, answer questions, assign exercises, practice answering questions, and so on. High-achieving students can also be assigned to each group as group leaders to answer easier questions. In this way, the number of failing students can be reduced, and they can become more proficient and deepen their understanding. The other is to conduct subject-based self-study within the class, with the original teacher providing guidance on the originally assigned assignments. The class time can be slightly longer, divided into two shorter sessions. In the upper session, there is class; in the lower session, there is self-study, such as 40 minutes or 30 minutes each. If there are many subjects and there is not enough time to allocate, major subjects can be selected, or even implemented one or two days a week. In a 50-minute session, 30 to 35 minutes can be used for class, and the remaining 20 minutes or a quarter of an hour can be used for selected self-study guidance so that the main difficulties have already been resolved under the guidance of the original teacher. Then, students will not find self-study as difficult as before.

Fifthly, secondary schools should not be concentrated solely in urban areas. They should also be popularized in rural towns and counties so that secondary students do not have to travel far from home. At the same time, schools should be familiar with the rural social situation and be able to adapt. Sending secondary schools to the countryside is an inevitable path after the war, so that China's lifeblood can be planted in every village. However, there is one difficulty: there are few students because Chinese villages are small and elementary education has not yet been popularized. Therefore, when initially establishing schools, it is appropriate to select villages or county towns in more densely populated locations with a suitable location. If there are not many students, a multi-grade system in the same year or a multi-year system can be used. However, the number of groups should not exceed two, so that two different levels can be guided by experienced teachers without wasting time. Questioning and self-study can be carried out simultaneously. Moreover, if this system is implemented, it is still possible to recruit spring semester students and conduct multi-grade teaching, so that no difficulties will arise due to a small number of people.

Finally, we must know that the key to implementing the above reforms lies in the selection of teachers. In the future, Chinese education lies not in changing the system and academic system, but in the training and retention of teachers. The Ministry of Education recently established normal colleges, providing five years of training. In addition to general and basic education courses, special emphasis is placed on subject and professional training, which is indeed a good strategy. Personality training is carried out through the tutor system, so the improvement of secondary education can be expected. However, the success of this type of talent training will take several years, and it may not be immediately popularized. Therefore, in the next five to ten years, in-service teacher training is also very important. It is generally observed that in-service teachers are not very enthusiastic about further education. The desire for progress and knowledge is one reason, but being constrained by family affairs and finances is also a major reason. Therefore, a salary equivalent to one-half or one-third of the salary of one teacher should be added to the natural school budget so that one teacher each year, every two years, or every three years can rotate to attend a further education class at the normal college for one year. During the leave period, the original salary will still be received, so that teachers will have no worries about the future, and their academic progress will certainly be more effective. What do education and youth administrators think about this? (End)

Puppet Regime Uses Calls for Submissions to Recruit Party Members, Attracting Unemployed Youth into the Trap

Hoping All Sectors Will Pay Close Attention

The number of unemployed youth in Shanghai after the war is very large. Although they live in extreme hardship, they remain steadfast in their aspirations, either relying on submissions to survive or seeking employment through various means in newspapers. Unexpectedly, the puppet organization is taking advantage of this opportunity to carry out evil schemes, using the name of publications to place advertisements in newspapers, soliciting submissions, or using the name of companies and businesses to recruit translators and document writers. The contact addresses are borrowed post office boxes or locations on roads built beyond the border. Unemployed youth, seeing this, believe that the opportunity to make a living has arrived and try one after another. In fact, those in charge are all members of the puppet organization, using this to recruit youth. If the applicants are unaware, they will use malicious plans, sending personnel to make contact, enticing them with sweet words and promises of gain, or threatening and deceiving them, stopping at nothing. The "China and Japan" monthly magazine and certain companies are recent examples. It is deeply hoped that unemployed youth will pay close attention and not fall into their trap.

### Li Huitang Scores Three Goals Out of Three Shots; Hong Kong Football Team Defeats Philippine Team; Manila Suffers a Miserable Defeat of Four to One; Bowser Is Not as Good as King Li

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The first inter-city football match between Hong Kong and Manila, which has never happened before, took place on the afternoon of the 18th at the Navy Stadium. As a result, the Hong Kong team won a crushing victory of four to one. The Philippines suffered a miserable defeat. The stands were packed with an estimated seven or eight thousand spectators.

Philippines Not as Good as Hong Kong

If the Hong Kong team's forwards could have fully utilized all their excellent opportunities, the scoring record would have been more than just that. The performance of the two inside forwards and the defense line was the best. The two wingers, Hou Chengtao and Fu La, were completely overshadowed. Although Fu La scored the fourth goal, the number of shots he missed was countless. The Manila players, although very agile, were far inferior in their ball control and strategy. The left inside forward, Bowser, was the soul of the entire Philippine team, providing the team's forward line with extremely accurate ball supply. However, Bowser was unable to accomplish anything alone, and the Philippine forwards' efforts were in vain, as Li Tiansheng and Shi Han calmly swept the ball away. The Philippine team adopted the third defender method, with central defender Yao Jidi often retreating to defend. As a result, the heavy responsibility of commanding the front line of the central army was concentrated on Bowser alone. However, since the Hong Kong team's central defense line was exceptionally strong, coupled with Feng Jingxiang and Dagao Shannu on the left and right for support, the entire army's advancing force was extremely formidable. For most of the time, the ball revolved in front of the Philippine team's goal. This midfield advantage was also one of the points where the Philippines was not as good as Hong Kong.

Ball King Iron Leg

Li Huitang, the Hong Kong team's captain and center forward, was the target of the forwards' passes. The ball king's leg is sure to score with one shot. Indeed, all three of Hong Kong's goals were scored by the ball king's iron leg. The power of his first and third shots was truly formidable, both being powerful shots from outside 20 yards. The second goal was scored with a pass from Dagao Shannu. At that time, the Philippine team had only the goalkeeper to support the army alone. Li scored with one shot. Among the forwards, in addition to Li, Feng Jingxiang and Dagao Shannu were also great contributors, working hard to create all kinds of opportunities for the center forward. Dagao Shannu, in particular, was excellent in both offense and defense, running around the field and being extremely active. The three outstanding players in the central line, Dickson, sat in the central plains, with Liang Rongzhao and Han Niweilu assisting on the left and right. Li Tiansheng and Shi Han's defense was even like an iron wall. Therefore, although Tan Jun Gan conceded a goal, there was almost no door to defend, and business was cold and desolate, only getting a few shots.

Opportunity is a Pity

Hong Kong missed countless opportunities, which is regrettable. In the first five minutes of the game, Fu La had an excellent opportunity, but he shot the ball against the crossbar. Hou Chengtao was only five yards away from the goal, but he also shot the ball wide. The poor quality of his shots was unprecedented. Feng Jingxiang was too cautious, passing the ball to Huitang as soon as he got it. Even in the extremely good position for himself to shoot, he would definitely pass it to Big Brother Li. Because Huitang was under severe surveillance by the opponent, some good opportunities were also wasted due to Jingxiang's excessive caution. Philippine central defender Yao Jidi was responsible for guarding Li Huitang, never leaving his side. When the Hong Kong side attacked, he retreated to the third defender position. However, Huitang saw through his trick and did not follow him. As a result, Yao Jidi often had no one to guard. Left winger Wallace was very good, making Hong Kong winger Fu La less active. The two defenders, Miranda and Bakhigo, were very fast, but they lacked calmness in tense moments. Goalkeeper Yao Oer was unable to save the first three goals. The fourth goal by Fu La was gained and then lost again.

Huitang's Three Arrows

Within the first five minutes of the kickoff, the Hong Kong team took the offensive. Then, they went back and forth, with the Hong Kong side showing a clear advantage. Then, the Hong Kong team advanced and got a corner kick. Hou Chengtao kicked the ball, and the ball happened to fall in front of the goal. Li Huitang kicked the ball and it went into the net. The Hong Kong team continued to attack, but although there were some opportunities, no further progress was made. The first half ended with a score of one to zero. Only one minute after the start of the second half, Dagao Shannu intercepted the ball from Nietu's feet and passed it to Li Huitang, who approached the goal and scored again, making it two to zero. The Philippine team counterattacked fiercely. Two minutes later, right winger Reyes did regain a goal, chasing to two to one. Half of the second half had passed, and Li Huitang scored the third goal. This goal was shot with his left foot and was unparalleled. Since the Hong Kong team had a clear advantage, the competition gradually became relaxed. A few minutes before the end of the game, Fu La shot the final fourth goal from a difficult angle.

### Relocation of Nanhui and Chuansha County Governments Completed - Urgency of Warplanes in Pudong - Japanese Military Works in Xinchang Completely Destroyed - Various Guerrilla Detachments Successfully Established Contact

The Japanese troops in Pudong, after suffering successive defeats, have dispatched two or three warplanes daily to intimidate and scout. The defeat at Xinchang Town on the sixth day of the Lunar New Year was particularly severe, resulting in casualties for the guerrillas as well. Although the Japanese resisted stubbornly on the Wang family's watchtower, setting up electric fences and fighting fiercely all night, they were eventually forced to retreat after the guerrillas completely destroyed their fortifications. Afterwards, the Japanese targeted Datuan Town in Nanhui County, and the commanders of the various guerrilla detachments are now planning to fully drive out the remaining Japanese troops who have invaded the border region of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties. However, during the general offensive, it is evident that the Japanese will resort to any means to harm the rear, and even use the pretext of the county government's involvement to harm non-combatant civilians. Therefore, it was decided to relocate the Nanhui County government to an inconspicuous location that is inaccessible to outsiders. The relocation of all departments was completed the day before yesterday, and the Chuansha County government has also been moved away from Heqing Town, ensuring that collaborators cannot provide guidance and Japanese warplanes cannot carry out their schemes. It is now reported that the guerrillas in Pudong have successfully established contact, and a major battle is expected to begin around the Lantern Festival.

Sudden Tension Along the Shangnan Line

The situation in the Shangnan Railway area of Pudong is tense, with frequent troop movements by the Japanese. Several batches, each consisting of three or four hundred soldiers, have been dispatched successively in the past few days. Most of them were transferred to the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to fight, while a small number were deployed to reinforce the western suburbs, leaving the defenses vulnerable. The day before yesterday, around 4 PM, over a hundred army soldiers were transferred back from the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, landed at Nanmatou, and rushed to Zhoupu Town, the terminus of the Shangnan Road, to station there. During the landing of these Japanese troops, the Nanmatou area was temporarily placed under martial law for half an hour. It was also learned that the Shangnan Railway, after having its tracks sabotaged in several sections by Chinese forces taking advantage of the situation, was not repaired until the afternoon of the 28th. Although the Shangnan passenger train service has resumed, Japanese troops, accompanied by puppet soldiers, are searching civilian houses in the Dongsanlintang area, causing disturbances to innocent villagers.

Guerrilla Troops Hold Important Meeting

Since the areas of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties in Pudong were brought under the control of our guerrilla forces, the Japanese and puppet forces have been unable to operate freely, only constructing fortresses in various strategic locations and stationing troops to guard them in order to prevent attacks by our guerrilla forces. In order to support the long-term resistance war, our guerrilla forces, which are lurking in various locations, held an important meeting at the Taili Bridge in Fengxian County last month. The guerrilla leaders who participated in the meeting included Ding Xueshan, Li Zhiming, Yu Taosheng, Qin Xingyan, Zhang Huifang, and Zhang Miaogen, numbering in the dozens. The important resolutions made were: (1) To establish a general command of the guerrilla forces in the eight counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Shangjin, Qingbao, and Jiading, with Ding Xueshan, Li Zhiming, and Yu Taosheng serving as the general and deputy commanders, respectively; (2) To mobilize troops to launch a general offensive against the Japanese troops on a specific date; (3) To organize civilian intelligence teams to infiltrate enemy-controlled areas and gather information on Japanese troop movements; (4) To mobilize the people of the eight counties to defend Chinese land with local armed forces; (5) To abolish exorbitant taxes and levies to alleviate commercial difficulties; (6) To organize mobile theater troupes to perform anti-Japanese dramas; (7) To request the Jiangsu Provincial Government to select cadres to go to the countryside and organize county governments. After the meeting, the guerrilla leaders returned to their respective defense areas.

Military Affairs Commission Issues Order

Strictly Prohibiting Gambling

Violators Will Be Punished for Obstructing the War of Resistance

The Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, recognizing that gambling wastes time and hinders work, and that such activities should not be tolerated during this time of war, has issued an order to all provinces to strictly prohibit it. The order is recorded below: "This war of resistance is a crucial moment for the survival of our nation. To defeat the brutal enemy and achieve victory, we must rely on the loyalty and courage of the entire country. All personnel at all levels of the Party, government, and military should be vigilant and diligent, eliminate bad habits, and devote all their abilities to public service, setting an example for the people. Those who continue to indulge in idleness and licentiousness will not only degrade themselves and dishonor their official duties but also betray the Party and the nation. From now on, all gambling is strictly prohibited. Those who dare to violate this order, once discovered and apprehended, will be punished under military law for obstructing the war of resistance without leniency. In addition to ordering all national police agencies to conduct strict investigations, we also issue this earnest warning, urging immediate compliance and instructing all subordinates to comply accordingly."

### Bomb Explosion on Jiangwan Road Kills Four Japanese - Two Others Seriously Injured

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, the Japanese-language Tairiku Nippo reported today (the 2nd) that the Quantai Woodworks factory on Dongjiangwan Road, a quarter of a mile behind the International Settlement's rifle range, has been destroyed by artillery fire. Buried in the rubble was an unidentified bomb, which exploded on Wednesday (the 1st) afternoon.

Four Japanese Killed

Four people were killed and two seriously injured, including four adults and two children. They were touring the Jiangwan battlefield when they stopped at the former factory. A 15-year-old boy named Ishikawa Hiroshi picked up the explosive device to examine it, and when it fell to the ground, it detonated in a terrifying explosion. A passerby saw a thick black cloud of smoke rising from the ruined factory and ran to the scene, witnessing a

Horrific Scene

One person was already dead, and the other five were wounded, lying on the ground groaning. Soldiers from the Japanese Naval Landing Force were notified and rushed the injured to Fumin Hospital in ambulances. Three of them died immediately upon arrival. Those who died were identified as Shichiku Saio, Shichiku Tetsushi, Matsubara Shoichi, and Ishikawa Hiroshi, all residing at No. 38, Fengle Lane. The injured were Sato Satoru and Matsubara Shoichi's daughter. Sato

Recently Arrived in Shanghai

An investigation into the nature of the explosive device began today. It is reported to have been a 3 cm diameter, 10 cm long device. It is believed to be either an old artillery shell or a hand grenade. The Japanese Consulate Police Department has notified the public to be aware of the dangers in the area surrounding the explosion site.

### Following a Series of Bombings, the Settlement is Under Strict Guard - Observers Suspect Organized Activity - Police Carefully Examining Retrieved Shrapnel

Following four consecutive bombings in the busy Nanjing Road area of the International Settlement the night before last, the police authorities are taking the matter very seriously for the sake of security within the Settlement. They are currently conducting a thorough investigation and have stepped up security measures to prevent the recurrence of similar unfortunate incidents. According to sources, these acts of violence appear to be organized with the intention of disrupting security within the Settlement and exploiting the situation. The details are as follows:

Observations on the Purpose of the Violence

Observations from various sources regarding the bombing incidents on Nanjing Road and elsewhere are as follows: (1) Since the outbreak of a series of "terrorist incidents" in the International Settlement at the end of last month, the authorities have actively strengthened preventive measures to maintain security, including blocking alleys and inspecting pedestrians and vehicles, as necessary police measures. It is unlikely that any misguided patriots would engage in terrorist acts under such tight security. (2) The repeated "terrorist incidents" have been purposeful and targeted, and they would not indiscriminately throw bombs in busy urban areas, harming innocent people. (3) The bombing incidents on the evening of March 1st involved as many as four separate explosions, occurring consecutively within an hour from 9:27 PM to 10:30 PM. It is clear that the intention was to disrupt security within the Settlement, and it can be inferred that these acts of violence were organized. The clues are not difficult to unravel.

Settlement Authorities Conducting Thorough Investigation

Since the bombing incidents occurred on Nanjing Road, Yinghua Street, Yuqiaqing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, etc. on the evening of March 1st, although the Settlement authorities have not yet apprehended any suspects related to the case, they are taking this violence very seriously. It is now learned that the police from various jurisdictions are carefully examining the retrieved shrapnel and various documents related to the case. Meanwhile, detectives have been secretly deployed to various important areas and venues to closely observe the activities of various individuals. Regarding defense, plainclothes detectives have been stationed in all public venues since 1 PM yesterday to pay attention to the movements of all individuals. Strict security measures have been implemented on busy roads in the evenings. The police stations in the French Concession have also deployed detectives to key roads and stations since yesterday to inspect pedestrians and passengers, in order to prevent undesirable elements from entering the Concession.

Areas with Dance Halls Are Under Special Attention

Following the consecutive bombing incidents on Nanjing Road in the International Settlement the night before last, security was further strengthened yesterday. Detectives were stationed near the New Asia Restaurant and Guanshengyuan Food Company, and Japanese detectives stood guard in front of the entrances. All locations where bombs exploded, such as the Great World, Cathay, Great Eastern, East Asia, and Ciro's, are dance halls. As a result, the police have issued special warnings to dance halls. On the night of the incidents, the police ordered all nearby dance halls to close by midnight. However, it remains to be seen whether the many dance halls that operate all night on Saturdays will be banned from doing so in the future.

Japanese Comments Reported in Western Press

According to the Tairiku Nippo, representatives from the Japanese Army, Navy, and Consulate Police Department visited the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities again yesterday (the 1st) shortly after 10 AM. They were received by Police Commissioner Bourne, Deputy Police Commissioner Smith, and Gilbert. The meeting lasted for three hours, and the Japanese representatives left the Council at 1 PM. While it is understood that the discussion focused on the actions of terrorists within the International Settlement and the current security measures taken by the police, no statement regarding the purpose of the Japanese representatives' visit was issued yesterday. Japanese officials did not announce the details of the meeting when hosting foreign journalists last night. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said, "We can only say that they exchanged views on the police administration of the International Settlement." The spokesman also did not know whether the discussions included the police administration of areas outside the Settlement and in the puppet government's controlled areas.

When a reporter asked

whether Police Commissioner Bourne had reached an agreement with the Japanese authorities, the spokesman replied, "This is not a question of agreement, only an exchange of views." When a reporter asked whether the French Concession had exchanged views with the Japanese authorities regarding the terrorist incidents, the spokesman replied, "There was no discussion of police administration in the French Concession." The spokesman announced in response to a reporter's request a few days ago that, from January 1st to February 22nd of this year, the Shanghai Japanese Consulate Police Department had recorded

Political Terrorist Cases

57 cases. According to information obtained by the spokesman, 49 of these cases were directed against Chinese and 8 against Japanese. Among the cases of attacks on Chinese, 36 occurred in the International Settlement, 8 outside the International Settlement, and 5 in the French Concession. Regarding terrorist attempts against Japanese, there were 4 cases inside and outside the International Settlement. When a reporter asked whether these cases were

All Political

acts of terrorism, the Embassy spokesman replied, "My information is as stated above." He was also asked whether he was sure that the alleged acts of terrorism within the International Settlement all occurred within the Settlement, or whether some terrorist cases occurred in the lanes and streets outside the Settlement under the control of the puppet government. The spokesman replied that he was quite busy and did not have time to investigate. He then said that, according to the information he had obtained, there were 36

Attacks Against Chinese

and 4 attacks against Japanese during the aforementioned period, all of which occurred within the area under the jurisdiction of the International Settlement police. When a reporter mentioned news from Nanjing recently released by the Tong Meng News Agency, Nanjing claimed that there had been 100 terrorist cases against members of the "Reformed Government" since the Japanese occupied the area. If so, would more than 50 of them have occurred in the puppet-controlled area? The spokesman replied that he was not aware of this information and needed to obtain more detailed information before discussing the matter.

### Foreign Ships Must Re-Register - Shanghai-Taiwan Route Approved to Resume - Ships Not Allowed to Leave Port Without Paying Public Welfare Fee - Japanese Warships Shell Zhenhai, Minor Damage to the Chinese Side

The situation near Haimen in Zhejiang Province has been unusually peaceful recently. Resumption of the Shanghai-Taiwan shipping route is anticipated. However, for strict security purposes, the military authorities require all foreign ships operating in the area to re-register. Shipping companies have complied with the order. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has telegraphed the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Command, instructing them not to allow foreign ships that have not paid the public welfare fee to leave port. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that Japanese warships shelled Zhenhai on the 27th of last month. The Modern News Agency reporter has provided the following details regarding the extent of the damage.

Shanghai-Taiwan Route Ships Must Re-Register
The original foreign merchant ships operating on the Haimen shipping route in Zhejiang Province included five ships from companies such as Jardine Matheson, San Tai, Harna, Golden, and Haifuk, which regularly sailed the route. On the 17th of last month, due to Japanese claims of taking military action, all ships were notified to leave the area. Starting on the 18th, four Japanese warships twice shelled the area, creating disturbances. After the local garrison fought back valiantly and inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese warships, the Japanese warships left. However, they sank sand and stone barges at the mouth of the Jiaojiang River, attempting to blockade the area. According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, the situation in Haimen has been peaceful recently. The authorities, in response to requests from foreign merchants, are preparing to allow the ships to resume operations. However, for strict security purposes, the Commander of the Xth Army Group has ordered Commissioner Xing to instruct all foreign ships originally operating on the route to re-register. The American merchant shipping companies in Shanghai, such as China Merchants, have received telegrams from their Haimen branches and have decided to comply with the re-registration procedures in order to resume shipping on the route and avoid suffering further business losses.

Ships Must Pay Fee to Leave Port

The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously stipulated that foreign ships operating on routes in eastern Zhejiang must pay a public welfare fee of 20% of their tonnage in order to raise funds for local development projects. Notices were sent to local shipping associations, instructing shipping companies to comply. It has been learned that the fee has been collected starting on the 25th of last month and the 1st of this month. The Ningbo Shipping Association received a letter yesterday from Inspector Yu of the Provincial Department of Finance, stating that the Provincial Department of Finance had telegraphed instructions that ships are required to present receipts for payment of the public welfare fee before being allowed to leave port. The Provincial Government has also telegraphed the Wenzhou-Taizhou and Ningbo Defense Commands, instructing them to comply with the order. All ships should not leave port without paying the public welfare fee to avoid being detained. After receiving the letter, the association immediately sent notices to all shipping companies, instructing them to comply.

Details of Japanese Warships Shelling Zhenhai

At 8:40 AM on the 27th of last month, three Japanese warships were spotted in the waters of Qilishiyu, outside Zhenhai. They suddenly opened fire on the shore, firing over thirty shells. The Modern News Agency correspondent stationed in Ningbo has investigated and confirmed the following details of the damage: A shell landed in the middle of the Mingtang courtyard at No. 6, Hujia Lane, Xihetang, Zhenhai, shattering three stone slabs and breaking five large vats. The door panels and walls of Jiang Quandong's house were damaged. The glass windows of the Chen and Yu families on either side were shattered. The shell landed in a hole several feet deep. A large piece of shrapnel landed on the house of Xie Yusheng at No. 15, Shaoyajie in the city, piercing the roof and breaking the staircase. A shell landed on Jiangnan Li Quanchang's stockyard street, injuring a duck. Two shells landed in the river in front of the Sanbei Company on Dadaotou. A shell landed on the mudflat in front of the Dongmen Customs. Another four shells landed in the river. A shell landed on the main road of the port, collapsing one room of Li Hengtai's kitchen. A shell landed near the Haiao Temple, Guangfu Temple, Tushan, Huangwaken, Lejiafang's house, Xielingdun, Da'ao Mountain, Houting Mountain, Lejia Ancestral Hall, Qigen mudflat, and Hujiadou. A shell landed on Shaxie Ridge, Qijiashan, destroying a coffin containing a female corpse. The coffin fragments scattered, and the corpse was torn apart, a truly tragic sight. Another shell landed on a stone pier nearby. A shell landed on the Hutantiao Temple in Qingzhi Lake, injuring a cook. A shell landed in a nearby field. A shell landed on Zhushan Tou, and another shell landed in front of Doufang. In this shelling, the Japanese warships mostly used explosives, so they detonated in the air.

### Inland Grain Transported Northward, Shanghai Grain Market Secure, Shanghai Municipal Council Issues Grain Regulation Report

According to a report on the grain issue recently released by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the Joint Rice and Grain Management Committee recently held a meeting to review the situation of the rice market in this port. It is estimated that there are 900,000 piculs of rice currently in the market. 10,000 piculs were shipped to Shanghai in January of this year on average each day. The French Concession currently has 96,000 bags of rice in storage, of which 30,000 bags were added in December of last year and January of this year. Although inland grain has been transported to

Northern Ports

the source of this port is stable and the impact is still small, so there is no need to worry too much about rice. According to the committee's report, at the end of November last year, when the committee held a meeting, the bureau had 10,606 bags of rice in storage. Later, fearing it would become moldy, it was thoroughly inspected and any that showed signs of mold were sold. The bureau currently has 6,156 bags of rice in storage. The Chief of the Finance Department, in view of the above-mentioned market

Rice Storage Situation

found it satisfactory and proposed to sell the rice stored by the bureau immediately. The committee also believed that since there was sufficient rice in the market, the amount stored by the bureau could be considered insignificant, and unanimously approved the Chief's proposal. The Chief also reported on the results of the bureau's purchase of Saigon rice. It was reported that a total of 22,720 tons of rice were purchased, with a profit of 280,000 yuan after sales. In addition, import merchants paid a total of 54,000 yuan. These merchants made a decision at the bureau's meeting to

Stop Purchasing Foreign Rice

after which the bureau provided convenience for them to purchase and transport it themselves, so they paid a certain amount. Regarding how to dispose of the above two sums of money, the Chief of the Finance Department believed that the 54,000 yuan paid by the rice merchants did not represent a loss to the bureau, and proposed to directly allocate it to the bureau's refugee relief fund to supplement the insufficient entertainment tax. As for the profit of 280,000 yuan, it was proposed to allocate it to the bureau's regular budget to offset the bureau's various departments' already and still existing expenditures on

Refugee Relief

expenses, such as refugee shelters, hospitals, water supply facilities, and police services, etc. The two methods proposed by the Chief were unanimously approved by the committee. The committee's report has been approved by the board of directors, and the funds allocated to the regular budget will be allocated immediately to reduce the bureau's refugee relief expenditures. This decision was made as all personnel from various departments of the bureau who participated in the organization and management of the grain mechanism could serve with enthusiasm. The Chief of the Finance Department promised to do his best, and the board of directors and the committee were deeply grateful.

Overseas Compatriots Go to the Philippines

Evacuation Measures

Have Been Negotiated and Decided

Able-bodied Men Cannot Evacuate

Instruction No. 198 of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, No. 198, states that regarding the evacuation of our people to the Philippines, our Consulate General in Manila has negotiated with the local government and obtained limited permission, which was approved by the President of the Philippines on November 29. The measures include the following five items: (1) Relatives and friends of overseas Chinese in the Philippines who wish to continue to reside, and new arrivals who come to the Philippines for refuge, must first fill out three copies of the application guarantee and four photos to the Consulate General, which will be forwarded to the Refugee Review Committee for review. The consulate will then send a letter to the Ministry of Industry for approval based on the committee's report. (2) Able-bodied men (i.e., men aged 18 to 45) and those with chronic diseases, bad habits, or improper behavior cannot enjoy the treatment of refugees. (3) The representative of the refugees must bear full responsibility for supporting the refugees and must be guaranteed by two stores. (4) After passing the Refugee Review Committee, the consulate will affix a receipt ticket issued by the Ministry of National Currency of 10 yuan (equivalent to 6.6 pesos) according to regulations. (5) Anyone who discovers that others are taking advantage of this to swindle and profit from it may submit evidence to the consulate for investigation. The above five points are closely related to our people going to the Philippines. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is issued to inform and notify all people going to the Philippines in the district, this order.

### Japanese General Shaves Head and Becomes a Monk, Once Commanded Operations in China

According to the French Shanghai Japanese Daily on the 2nd, according to Japanese sources, Japanese General Maki, who previously landed at Jinshanwei, Hangzhou Bay, recently shaved his head and became a monk. However, it is not known what stimulated him to do this.

### Puppet Organization Handles Lawyer "Registration," The Legal Profession Righteously Refuses, Puppet Helplessly Extends Deadline by Three Months, Legal Professionals Resolve to Continue Ignoring It

Since the puppet "Judicial Administration Department of the Reformed Government" declared its "establishment," in order to control lawyers in the occupied areas, it issued a "notice" last year to handle lawyer "registration" and replace "new certificates" within three months. However, legal professionals, all of whom are intellectuals, are able to understand the greater righteousness and are unwilling to sell their souls. Therefore, except for a few scoundrels, the majority of lawyers unanimously refused. Those who came to Shanghai to practice law in the past joined together. Now, as the deadline is approaching, the puppet "Ministry of Justice" sees that no one has "registered," which is a very sad situation. However, it still tries to continue to lure them, so it recently issued a notice to extend the "registration" deadline by another three months. However, it is understood that legal professionals are determined to adhere to their original intention, ignore it, and never be tempted. It is expected that the "registration" move will ultimately be just a dream.

Li Zhiming

Pudong Battle Achievements

Quickly Recaptures Key Areas in Fierce Battle with Japanese

Japanese Troops Flee in Panic

Pudong guerrilla commander Li Zhiming is active in the Pudong area and has attracted much attention from the public. Recently, Li received orders from his superiors and led the first and fourth battalions, led by Chen Zhiyang, to attack the Japanese military base in Nanqiao on the 22nd of last month. At 12:00 PM that night, Li personally commanded the attack. After several fierce charges, Nanqiao Town was once occupied, and two portable machine guns, two rifles, one Mauser pistol, and one pistol, as well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition, were seized. Five Japanese soldiers were killed. However, two squad leaders, Yu Jiaqing and Zhang Fufan, and one squad leader of Li's unit were also wounded and died on the spot. However, after the Japanese troops retreated from Nanqiao, they were unwilling to give up. At 5:00 AM the next morning, they drew reinforcements from Minhang and launched a counterattack on Nanqiao with heavy weapons. Li, believing that the mission had been accomplished and unwilling to make unnecessary sacrifices, led his troops to withdraw from the town. On the 25th, Li was ordered again to lead the second battalion, led by Zhang Sigong, to join the fourth detachment's Chief of Staff Bai, and lead Gu Shouxin's troops to attack Xinchang that night. The sound of gunfire was like a string of pearls, and the fierce charge was due to Bai's leading by example and commanding effectively. The Japanese troops were unable to resist until 5:00 AM the next morning and retreated completely towards Xiansha, suffering heavy losses. At that time, Zhang and Gu's troops immediately stationed in Xinchang Town and restored order. The national flag flew all over the town, and the people cheered. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM, the Japanese troops dispatched a large number of reinforcements and launched a counterattack on the town. The artillery fire was exceptionally fierce, and many houses in the city were destroyed. However, Zhang and Gu's troops still resisted calmly, dividing the entire town into the southeast sections. As a result, the eastern section was occupied by the Japanese troops, while the southern section remained in the hands of the Chinese troops. As of now, the two sides are still facing each other across the bridge.

Welsh People in England Celebrate Festival

Offer Wreaths Before the God of Peace

And Hold Dance Parties

The China Press reported that the Welsh people in England, scattered around the world, celebrated St. David's Day yesterday (the 1st). Although there are not many Welsh expatriates in Shanghai, they also celebrated it in a big way yesterday. They went to the God of Peace in the morning to hold the annual wreath-offering ceremony. Then, the Shanghai St. David's Association hosted the annual St. David's Day dance party at the French Fencing Association. More than 200 people attended, and the British Consul General in Shanghai, Philip, also attended, making it very lively. It ended late at night.

Inland Silk Factories

Coming to Shanghai to Set Up Factories One After Another

Five or Six New Ones Established

After the silk factories in the Chinese-controlled areas of Shanghai and the guerrilla areas in the interior were closed due to the impact of the war, they have been rushing to relocate and resume work in the areas beyond the boundaries of the Shanghai International Settlement. More than 40 have been established one after another in the past year. As the silk market is active in foreign markets, the factories are rushing to ship goods. Therefore, most of the silk factories in Shanghai's West had profits last year. Since the beginning of this year, inland manufacturers have seen that the sales of silk are still strong, and they all intend to set up factories and workshops in Shanghai's West. It is reported that in the areas beyond the boundaries of the Shanghai International Settlement, there have been five or six new silk factories established so far this year, all of which are actively preparing to start work in the near future. The number of newly built factories in the Shanghai's West area has suddenly increased, and the market is gradually becoming lively.

Japanese Cigarettes

Poor Quality and Difficult to Sell

Even the Japanese Don't Smoke Them

Yesterday (the 1st), the Japanese-language Continental New Daily reported that the Japanese tobacco industry has failed to keep pace with other Japanese businesses that have entered central China along with the Japanese army. Japanese merchants operating tobacco in this port have expressed regret over this development. This phenomenon is due to the poor quality of the tobacco itself and the

Packaging of cigarette boxes and cans is not attractive. Even the people in the Japanese-occupied areas, including the Japanese expatriates in Hongkou, would rather give up Japanese-made cigarettes and smoke foreign brand cigarettes with better quality. Only a very small number of smokers buy Japanese cigarettes. The Japanese army and navy consume nine-tenths of the Japanese cigarettes in this port, and the rest are bought by civilian smokers. Although Japanese cigarettes are cheap, they still cannot gain an advantage, because

Coolies and rickshaw pullers are willing to smoke Chinese-made cigarettes. Those Japanese who are accustomed to smoking foreign cigarettes do not follow the urging of their patriotic compatriots to buy domestic products in terms of cigarettes. Those who can buy better cigarettes at the same low price and still want to buy Japanese cigarettes have rare taste.

Postal Remittance Bureau Increases Remittance Amount to Shanghai

From 500 Yuan to 1,000 Yuan

Parcels on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Line Resume

The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau previously stipulated that the amount of money remitted from postal offices of all sizes in all cities to Shanghai was limited to 500 yuan per person per day. A reporter from the New Sound Society learned from the bureau yesterday that the bureau, in order to be considerate of the difficulties of merchants, has increased the amount of money remitted from other places to Shanghai to a limit of 1,000 yuan per person per day, so as to facilitate merchants. It was also learned that the Shanghai Postal Administration has also resumed accepting large parcels destined for all cities and towns along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from Beihai to Kunming, with a limit of 20 kilograms per item. Detailed regulations are in place for the charge per kilogram.

Puppet "Municipal Government" Forcibly Registers White Russians

Most White Russians Are Unwilling

Registration Period Will Be Extended

The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 1st), it was learned that the "Shanghai Municipal Government" under Japanese protection has again agreed to extend the registration period for White Russian immigrants. The new deadline is roughly set for March 15. Today (the 2nd), it can be confirmed. The registration period was originally scheduled to end on February 15. Because only a small number of White Russians in this port went to register, the deadline was extended to March 1. However, as of February 28, there were still many White Russians

Did Not Register

The White Russian Immigration Committee then applied for another extension, which has been approved. However, the length of the extension has not yet been officially announced. The "Shanghai Municipal Government" announced yesterday that it will soon announce its attitude towards White Russian immigrants who still hold expired passports from the Central Government. This issue is currently under consideration by the "Reformed Government" in Nanjing, and a decision will be announced here soon. Although White Russian immigrants generally oppose registering with the puppet regime, those who do not register will not be allowed to travel in areas controlled by the Japanese army.

### Shanghai Customs Exports in January: Tax-Exempt Goods Worth 19 Million, Exceeding Taxable Goods by Nearly Double

### The Prospect of Far Eastern Finance in the Sino-Japanese War (Part 1): Chinese Finance Remains Stable Due to Sophisticated Management, Japanese Yen Devalues Due to the Impact of the War, Speech by the Chairman of the HSBC Annual Meeting

HSBC, a British bank, is a foreign bank with financial authority in the Far East and has a deep relationship with Chinese finance and trade. At its annual meeting held in Hong Kong, Chairman Pearce gave a detailed account of Far Eastern finance and commerce during the Sino-Japanese War, based on various investigations. Its content has important observations and conclusions on China's financial finance, the daily devaluation of the Japanese yen, and the future trends of finance and trade in the Far East. The following is the original speech by Pearce found by a reporter from the New Sound Society.

More Than 10 Million Yuan in Profits Last Year

Dear Shareholders, the balance sheet for the past year has been circulated separately. I would now like to briefly read it again. After making significant losses and provisions, the net profit for the past year was 15,296,621 yuan, 3 jiao and 2 fen. If this number is added to the 3,383,004 yuan, 5 jiao and 3 fen carried forward from the previous year, after calculating at 1 shilling, 2 pence and 7/8, paying an interim dividend of 400,000 pounds, and paying directors' remuneration, the remaining amount available for distribution is 12,145,172 yuan and 0.08 fen. The following distribution method is now proposed: distribute a dividend of 3 pounds per share (after deducting income tax), totaling 7,744,537 yuan, 8 jiao and 2 fen, transfer 1 million yuan to the bank building item, and carry forward 3,400,634 yuan, 2 jiao and 6 fen to the new account item, totaling 12,145,172 yuan and 0.08 fen. The calculations of the items on the balance sheet are based on the calculation rate of last year, which is 1 shilling, 2 pence and 7/8 per Hong Kong dollar. As for the liabilities in the balance sheet, both the liabilities and assets must increase by 20 million yuan. The term deposit account has increased by 11 million yuan. As for the assets, the cash item has increased by 42 million yuan, the investment item has increased by 30 million yuan, the loan item has decreased by 13 million yuan, and the bills receivable item has increased by 46 million yuan.

Unstable Situation Affects Finance

Over the years, the chairman of the conference has given a detailed analysis of the political, financial, and commercial situation in the Far East in his speech. In a year when the political situation is so difficult and the financial and commercial situation is so abnormal, although I will elaborate on these topics, I will only discuss them in general terms. I have not had time to mention or elaborate on the matters that you hope to be rigorously reviewed or explained in detail. I believe that you will be disappointed by this. Given my position, if I were to speak in detail about the current entangled and difficult political matters, I know that you would also consider this to be unwise. We are not involved in any government's secrets. The more we say, the easier it is to cause misunderstandings. Our balance sheet shows that although we have encountered many difficulties, we are still making unique progress. The optimism expressed by the chairman last year has also proved to be reasonable. However, those of us who have significant commercial interests here know that if the two major neighboring countries in the East are hostile to each other, the financial and economic situation will not be stable for a day and will change constantly. The current dispute is also causing dissatisfaction with the "open door" and even the maintenance of British rights and interests in China. Some people are deeply resentful of our British government for not taking strong and effective steps in the Far East and Europe. However, I do not intend to criticize our British diplomatic authorities today.

Hope that Japan will Fulfill its Promises

In times of international crisis, the freedom of speech and publication should be limited. Lately, I believe that careless criticism, the falsehood of rumors, and the publication of news have caused no small harm to society. I also believe that the recent debate in our England on foreign relations has gone beyond what is necessary. In any case, our British government is now greatly increasing its strength on the one hand, and at the same time seeking to advance world peace, disentangling itself from all entanglements, and being well prepared to deal with future unpredictable situations without the difficulty of being drawn into the vortex. It should also be affirmed that the countries that maintain interests in the Far East have also made their positions clear. Our country's position is completely in accordance with international treaties. Unilateral modifications to treaties or agreements such as the Washington Treaty will not be considered. The Japanese side has also made very clear promises that it will respect the interests of the great powers in its occupied areas as much as possible and maintain the "open door." Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made the above promise on January 22 last year. Japanese senior officials have also repeatedly extended it. However, these promises are not in harmony with the evolution of the situation in North China and Central China. We occupy an important position in the Far Eastern economic structure and are eager for the agreement and the appropriate verification and announcement to match words and deeds and be faithfully implemented.

Japanese Puppets Destroy North China Currency

Regarding China's financial situation, you probably already know what the situation is like. Like other countries, there is more than one exchange rate for the currency. The exchange rate and the open market exchange rate vary from place to place due to restrictions on the transport of banknotes. Until March, the foreign exchange situation in Shanghai was still able to maintain perfection. However, after the establishment of the "North China United Reserve Bank" and its attempt to destroy the Chinese currency, foreign exchange restriction measures were implemented. As a result, brokers tried their best to find places to buy foreign exchange, and the "black market" began. Later, it became Shanghai's normal open market, separate from the strictly restricted exchange rate. The more restricted the market was by the allocation of exchange rates according to the exchange rate, the worse the exchange rate in the open market became. In mid-May, each yuan was worth 10 and a half pence. A month later, it fell to 8 pence. In early August, it fell to the lowest rate of 7 pence and 7/8. At that time, it received assistance, and the low tide turned immediately, and the exchange rate rose back to about 8 and a half pence. Since then, this exchange rate has been able to maintain a flat rate, and it has only been slightly changed when there are military or political developments or the spread of rumors. At the end of last year, not only did "capital outflow completely stop, but a considerable amount of withdrawn capital was also available. From the above description, it can be seen how difficult it was for bankers during the first nine months. Even now, it is still like this. I only call it the horror of "external forces," and the situation is still bleak.

### A View on the Evils of Early and Late Marriage

— Yang Daonan, Medical Department, Russian Labor University

Fula Quao said, "The children born to young couples are like fruits grown and cultivated in warm rooms in winter, tender and tasteless." This statement best describes the evils of early marriage. Therefore, few children born to early marriages are strong. As for the reasons for early marriage in our country, it is only because parents are too eager for grandchildren, thinking that if they have grandchildren, their parents will be sacrificed after their death, which is a big mistake. Therefore, what we should pay attention to is not to have more children, but to have better children.

As for late marriage, there are also evils. Men who marry after the age of 35 have lost most of their lively enthusiasm, and their physical strength and temperament have gradually weakened. The joy of marriage has been reduced a lot. Most of their children are not yet adults, and the father is already gray-haired and cannot fulfill his responsibility of raising them. Women who marry late in life often have obstacles in their reproductive organs, which easily lead to difficult labor and "hysteria."

The age difference between husband and wife is too great, and the physical strength and temperament are different, which is often the cause of discord in the family. For example, if the man is too old and the woman is too young, the man reluctantly satisfies the woman's sexual love, which will lead to physical and mental weakness throughout his life, leading to diseases such as incomplete development. Men and women of the same age, or women older than men, do not have much impact at the time of marriage, but later, when compared, the woman has aged, and the man is still young and strong, which is also the cause of discord in the family.

When it comes to love between husband and wife, those who are physiologically mature but not lewd are the happiest. Those who are lewd will definitely dissipate their energy and have many kidney deficiency problems. At the same time, if the husband is old, his energy will weaken, which is also one of the reasons for unhappiness between husband and wife.

Those with this kind of problem are indeed the main cause of family disharmony. However, modern medicine is advancing and is studying the endocrine of animal testicles as the basic strategy for treating sexual weakness. Among them, the most effective is "Buttico," a male animal youth glandular preparation invented by Dr. Meulen of Germany. Because it not only takes the testicular essence from chimpanzees, stags, and calves, but also infiltrates famous tonics from mineral plants, the refining is carried out under purple light with the latest scientific methods, so the main pure quality is completely preserved, and the remedy and resistance are appropriate, so that it can exert its full effect. Among the drugs for treating sexual dysfunction, there is none that surpasses it.

Today, medical scientists all praise the drug's power for the treatment of sexual weakness, because the drug's function actively promotes bone and muscle development in childhood, and can also relieve neurasthenia, promote reproductive function, nourish the brain, and nourish the kidneys. It also eliminates substances that damage the body and turns them into harmless substances, specializes in metabolic power, and makes the body and mind rejuvenate, restoring a happy and lively life. According to my personal observation, an old man who is already 60 years old, after taking three boxes of "Buttico" in a row, his asthma and insomnia completely disappeared, and he was able to walk leisurely without feeling tired at all, which proves its effectiveness. The female version ("Buttico") functions to regulate menstruation and seeds, and promote breast development, making it a sacred medicine for gynecology.

### The Healthy Path to Nocturnal Emission

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

When discussing the treatment of nocturnal emission, it is imperative to strictly adhere to the principles of health preservation. This has a profound impact on the treatment process. Often, because sufferers are unaware of these principles, even the most experienced physicians find it difficult to help, leading to the worsening of the condition in numerous cases. Therefore, patients should either not seek treatment at all or, if they desire a swift return to health, pay utmost attention to health maintenance. Methods of health preservation include resolute abstinence from masturbation, avoidance of overexertion of the body and mind, avoidance of alcohol and late nights, abstaining from sour and spicy foods, regulating bowel movements, avoiding the reading of erotic books and viewing of erotic pictures, and cultivating a pure and desireless mind. These practices are highly beneficial to treatment, and patients are encouraged to adopt them.

Based on my clinical experience treating thousands of patients over the past decade, the most effective medicine is undoubtedly "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Pills," invented by French physiologist Dr. Nairis. This is because its ingredients genuinely consolidate the seminal gate, calm the brain, and regulate endocrine function. Dr. Nairis holds a government honorary award in France, proving that this medicine is not comparable to ordinary, crudely manufactured products. Furthermore, electrotherapy, cold water friction, and other therapies can only serve as supplementary treatments, as their effectiveness is not as outstanding as this medicine. Other types of sperm-consolidating pills on the market are not worth considering at all. There are many young men in our country suffering from nocturnal emission. I hereby solemnly advise that if you wish to quickly restore your health, there is truly no other way.

Modern Medicine

### Statistics on the Highest Peak in Treating Gonorrhea

— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

Let's not talk about theory, only about practice, because theory is, of course, an explanation of facts. In reality, gonorrhea, in this age of all-powerful science, is truly not a cause for concern. This is because the treatment of gonorrhea is improving daily, greatly differing from what it once was. This can certainly be proven by recent gonorrhea treatments. Originally, treating gonorrhea required a calm and persevering spirit to deal with it step by step. It is essential to avoid impatience and seeking quick success, or recklessly using potent drugs. Gonococci are inherently stubborn, and unless one proceeds systematically, combining suppression and pacification, it is impossible to completely eradicate them. Even if one achieves temporary success, the virus will recur shortly after, causing inflammation in various parts and endless future troubles.

Recently, in various European and American countries, a new change has occurred in the treatment of gonorrhea. Namely, a unanimous endorsement of "Clininon," a specific drug for gonorrhea. Furthermore, new statistics show that ordinary acute gonorrhea can be completely cured by taking four or five bottles of this medicine. Long-term, chronic gonorrhea, as well as prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, and other conditions, can be completely cured in almost all cases by taking "Clininon" for about seven or eight bottles. However, there are occasional exceptions, which are few in number. Furthermore, there are also cases where full efficacy is achieved with less than half a dozen bottles. According to Dr. Baulerson's statistics, since the invention of "Clininon" in Germany, over 98% of those who took this medicine were cured. Among chronic cases, 93% were completely cured and did not recur. This has achieved the highest peak in the history of gonorrhea treatment experience. Dr. Schiller also compared the effectiveness of "Clininon" with other newly produced drugs. The general new drugs are far inferior to "Clininon." Therefore, "Clininon" can remain ever new, greatly differing from the general drugs that are new today and old tomorrow. Every gonorrhea patient who is not cured by taking other drugs will be completely cured by taking "Clininon."

Gonorrhea Lecture
— Doctor Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

### Painless Leucorrhea

Leucorrhea, along with buboes and chancres, is known in the venereal disease world for its painful nature, and it holds the top position. Anyone who has suffered from gonorrhea will certainly agree with what I say. Although general patients are naturally panicked and at a loss during acute gonorrhea, once they pass this acute stage, the pain gradually decreases, and the patient's attention fades along with the reduction of gonorrhea symptoms. They even believe that the disease has naturally healed, and they continue as before, which is extremely dangerous. In reality, gonorrhea sufferers often experience a deepening of leucorrhea symptoms, leading to gonococcal prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, arthritis, etc., which erupt one after another. Therefore, this kind of painless leucorrhea is much more dangerous than painful leucorrhea, which is undeniable.

Therefore, effective measures must be taken against this kind of painless leucorrhea. In the countless patients I have treated, the only effective therapies for this condition are German electrostatic therapy and X-ray therapy used in combination, along with orally administered "Clininon," the world-renowned holy medicine for gonorrhea, to completely resolve the gonococci that have penetrated deep inside, leaving no residual disease to cause recurrence. Clinic hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty patients will be seen each day, and the fee for each appointment is only fifty cents.

### No Worries About Lung Disease!

— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang

Although hemoptysis (coughing up blood) in lung disease can startle patients, it is not an absolutely fatal condition. Therefore, in my clinical practice, I advise patients to absolutely maintain their health and actively take "Pulmonal," a specific medicine for lung disease produced in Germany, which truly has the effect of searching out and tonifying the lungs. This medicine has the effect of directly eradicating tubercle bacilli, resolving phlegm, suppressing coughs, and coagulating blood. It can also relieve hectic fever and night sweats, and all stages of lung disease can be completely cured.

### Pseudo "Municipal Government" Economic Panic: Rumor of Xiaoyuan Under Pressure, the Pseudo "Reformed Government" Intends to Make Things Difficult, Recent Rumors of Resignation and Replacement with a Stooge

Since the pseudo "Municipal Government" abolished the pseudo "Consumption Tax," a major economic panic has erupted. As February has ended, there have been waves of "staff" reductions, "salary" cuts, and the abolition of affiliated organizations. The future fate of the pseudo "government" is becoming increasingly tragic and terrifying. The details are as follows:

Golden Age: During the era of the pseudo "Superintendent Office" under Su Xiwenz, the monthly pseudo "Consumption Tax" revenue could reach 450,000 to 500,000 yuan. The actual expenses of the pseudo "office" and various pseudo "bureaus" only required 400,000 yuan, leaving a monthly surplus of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, like a shop. This was the golden age of the pseudo-organization. Since the jealous ascension of Chuan Xiaoyuan and the reorganization into the pseudo "Municipal Government," due to attempts to expand territory, the monthly budget suddenly increased to 600,000 yuan. As a result, income could not meet expenses, and the golden age became a thing of the past.

Staff Reductions and Salary Cuts: The pseudo "Reformed Government" even forced Fu Xiaoyuan to abolish thirty-eight kinds of "Consumption Taxes" with a pseudo "decree," only promising to subsidize the pseudo "government" with 400,000 yuan per month starting in February. At the end of last month, this subsidy was not received, revealing the deception. As a result, it was necessary to resort to "staff" reductions and "salary" cuts. All pseudo-officials, large and small, in the pseudo "government," pseudo "bureaus," and various pseudo "sections" (except for pseudo "bureau chiefs" and pseudo "section chiefs") were eliminated based on the complexity of their work, with a maximum reduction of 40%. Those who were not eliminated also had their "salaries" cut across the board. The pseudo "bureau chiefs'" pseudo "salaries" remained the same. Each pseudo "section chief" was only reduced by 20 yuan. Previously, pseudo "section members" received at least 100 yuan, but now it is reduced to 80 yuan. Pseudo "clerks" used to receive 60 yuan, but now it is reduced to 40 yuan, 45 yuan, and 50 yuan in three grades. Pseudo "secretaries" used to receive 40 yuan, but now it is reduced to 30 yuan, 35 yuan, and 40 yuan in three grades. Because the pseudo mayor, pseudo bureau chiefs, and pseudo secretaries were not reduced in salary, the lower-level pseudo-officials felt that the treatment was unfair and secretly cursed.

Fate of the Pseudo Government: After Fu Xiaoyuan was forced to carry out large-scale staff reductions, he also abolished several affiliated organizations, such as the pseudo "Luren Hospitals" in the four suburbs, pseudo "treatment centers," and pseudo "fire brigades." With this move, the budget could be reduced by 100,000 yuan per month. However, at least 500,000 yuan must still be spent each month to maintain operations. Since the "Reformed Government's" monthly subsidy of 400,000 yuan is hopeless, and there is no income this month, the future fate of the pseudo "government" will be even more tragic and terrifying. It is said that Chuan Xiaoyuan has been frowning and deeply locked in thought for days, regretting his initial decision to be a running dog.

Forced Resignation: However, according to those familiar with the inside story of the pseudo-organization, the pseudo "Reformed Government" has not fulfilled its promise of a 400,000 yuan subsidy. On the one hand, this is due to economic difficulties and self-preservation. On the other hand, it is also due to the pseudo "Reformed Government's" dissatisfaction with Chuan. Since Chuan's appearance, he has been self-aggrandizing in everything, repeatedly clashing with the pseudo "Reformed Government" over rights. The most obvious example is relying on background forces to expand territory (the "pseudo government" plans to seize ten counties in the suburbs). Also, conflicts with the "Jiangsu pseudo provincial government" over Jiading County and with the Nanjing "pseudo judicial administration department" over Shanghai's pseudo "judicial power" have all displeased Liang Hongzhi and his cohorts. Therefore, this time, they want to bring down Chuan, making it impossible for him to cope, forcing him to step down, and then appoint another stooge to replace him. Recently, there have been widespread rumors that Chuan will be transferred to the pseudo "Nanjing Municipal Superintendent," which is also for this reason.

Bean Curd Shop Apprentice Died Unnaturally: Shop Owner Suspected and Arrested

Yu Arong, the owner of the Fuxingfa Bean Curd Shop at 544 Connaught Road and a native of Liuhe, is related to the case of Wang Pan'gen, a 20-year-old apprentice from Tongzhou, who died from a head injury. The detective from the Gordon Road Police Station was dispatched the day before yesterday to arrest Yu Arong at his address and detain him at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that the cause of the case was that at around 3:00 PM on the 28th of last month, Chinese Constable No. 242 of the Gordon Road Police Station was patrolling near Connaught Road when he suddenly saw a rickshaw puller pushing a patient, Wang Pan'gen, facing him. Someone named Qian Jindao followed behind. According to him, this patient was an apprentice at the Fuxingfa Bean Curd Shop. Recently, he became ill, but the shop owner, the defendant Yu Arong, refused to pay for a doctor to treat him and sent him to his maternal uncle, Chen Wenhou's home, to find a way to treat him. Chen also had no money and had to send Wang back to the shop. Unexpectedly, the defendant firmly refused to keep him and rejected his return. Qian Jindao found it difficult to arrange things. Because of the head injury on Wang's head, the defendant hit him with a wooden stick because he was clumsy in his work. Therefore, he sent him back to the shop again. On the way, he was discovered by the Chinese constable, who inquired about the situation and telegraphed the police station to send an ambulance to take him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, Wang's occipital bone was broken, and he died after a while. Now, the corpse has been transported to the mortuary for examination. The defendant claimed at the police station that the deceased accidentally fell from the upper floor at about 3:00 AM on the 27th of last month when he wanted to defecate, causing a head injury, and that he did not beat him. Please postpone the investigation, etc. Xu Xiaomao, an apprentice in the same shop, testified that the defendant did not injure the deceased's head, and that he injured himself by falling, etc. Magistrate Huang Risheng questioned the defendant Yu Arong and ordered him to remain in custody and reschedule the hearing.

### Missing Russian Boy on His Way to Chongqing: Said to Be Not Far from Chongqing, His Mother Refuses to Comment

The Mainland News reports that Sergei Streletzov, the 15-year-old son of a Soviet expatriate in Shanghai, a student at the Shanghai Municipal Council's Western Boys' School, disappeared two weeks ago and appears to have gone to join the Chinese army. As far as is currently known, he is now in the interior of China, en route to Chongqing. He is said to be not far from Chongqing. His mother, Mrs. Streletzov, the manager of the Shanghai branch of TASS, refused to comment on her son's disappearance yesterday (the 1st). To date, all news regarding the boy's whereabouts has been vague and uncertain. It is also unknown where the boy was last seen.

### Maid Steals Money and Elopes: Plans to Return to Her Hometown with Her Lover, Case Solved and Sent to Court for Trial

Shao Leping, deputy manager of the Taiping Insurance Company, lives at No. 7, Lane 1457, Avenue Edward VII. He has a maid named Donglan, who has been working for him for seven years. The girl is now seventeen years old. After dinner on the 14th of last month, Shao instructed the girl to go upstairs to the bedroom to fetch clothes. Unexpectedly, she stole 250 yuan in legal tender from his pocket and escaped through the side door without a trace. Shao reported the case to the police and requested an investigation. The day before yesterday, the Chinese and Western detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station finally learned that the girl and her lover, Zhu Zhengkuan, a fellow villager from Jiangbei, were hiding in Room 16 of the Chongqing Hotel on Chongqing Road. They immediately arrested the girl and Zhu together. Upon searching them, they found only 95 yuan in legal tender and two travel permits to return to their hometown of Jiangbei, Yangzhou, issued by the Japanese. They were taken to the police station. Under questioning, they confessed that they planned to leave Shanghai and return to their hometown within days. 150 yuan of the stolen money was given to Zhu's father, and the rest, except for what was found, had already been spent. Zhu also confessed that his father runs a meal delivery business on Hardoon Road, and that the woman was referred to him by Yang Ma, a former maid dismissed from Shao's house, and that he did not entice her, etc. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Magistrate Meng interrogated them. Qian Xunjiu, the police station's lawyer, explained the case and requested a postponement because the stolen money still needed to be investigated. The court then questioned the two defendants and ordered them to remain in custody separately and reschedule the hearing.

Chinese Constable Dies in the Line of Duty: Funeral Today

At the Anle Cotton Mill on Brenan Road, eight bandits suddenly broke in and robbed the place at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday. As the bandits were searching, robbing, fighting, and attempting to escape, they were spotted by Chinese Constable Xu Xiaotong, No. 2067. The bandits, thinking that the case had been exposed, immediately opened fire on the constable, unfortunately hitting a vital area and causing his death. The details were recorded in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. Xu Xiaotong was from Hebei, courtesy name Wenquan, 36 years old. He was known for his honest service and left behind a wife and daughter in poverty. The body has been examined by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Mortuary and transported by the Chinese Funeral Home on Haifang Road for the funeral. It is reported that all police officers of the Shanghai Municipal Council will go to the Chinese Funeral Home tomorrow morning to pay their respects and form a procession for the funeral. There is bound to be a spectacle on Haifang Road at that time.

### Doctor's Wife Adultery with Barber: Kicks Concubine's Pregnant Belly During Confrontation, Husband Reports to Police Station and Sends Her to Court

Wang Tianshou, a native of Yangzhou who resides at 274 Carter Road in West Shanghai, practices medicine. He has one wife and one concubine, both young and beautiful. His wife, Ms. Ba, has an affair with Feng Deyou, a worker at the Xingji Barber Shop located downstairs. At 2:30 PM on the 27th of last month, Wang's concubine, Ms. Zhu, happened to go to the wife's room and witnessed Yan and Feng lying on the bed together. She informed Wang Tianshou, who then

Caught a Pair of Adulterers

and sent them to the Zhabei Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, Wang claimed that he would file for divorce from Yan and did not want to request an investigation or public prosecution for adultery. Therefore, all the men and women were reprimanded and dismissed. After returning home, Yan harbored deep hatred for Zhu for exposing her adultery. She

Made Veiled Accusations

and deliberately provoked quarrels. Wang and others already disdained her and did not argue with her. However, Yan not only failed to restrain herself but also suddenly broke into Zhu's room at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, kicked Zhu's abdomen, and cursed loudly. Wang Tianshou then called Chinese Constable No. 2634, who arrested Yan and took her to the Zhabei Police Station, and then

Sent Her to Women's Prison for Detention.

He then sent Zhu to the hospital for examination. It was found that she was pregnant but had not been injured. However, after returning home, she suddenly felt severe abdominal pain and was immediately taken to the Boai Hospital. After examination by the hospital, it was found that the fetus had moved and was about to abort. Therefore, when the police sent Wang Yan to the First Special District Local Court for trial yesterday morning, the victim, Wang Zhu, was unable to attend court due to her injuries and treatment, and instead,

Wang Tianshou Filed the Case

and explained the circumstances. Qian Xunjiu, the police station's lawyer, immediately requested that the case be postponed. The defendant then hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to defend her, claiming that she had been falsely accused of adultery by Zhu and others. Magistrate Meng Tingke then questioned the defendant and ordered her to remain in custody and reschedule the hearing.

Breach of Marriage Agreement

Judgment Yesterday

Zheng Zuoxuan Should Compensate Zhang Xiuying

A Total of 50,000 Yuan for Living Expenses

Zheng Zuoyi, 21, the son of Zheng Mengyuan, a Chaozhou native and owner of the Koucheng Pawnshop on Albert Road in the French Concession, who has assets of five to six million yuan and works at the Ning Shao Insurance Company, was introduced to Zhang Xiuying, a woman from Wuxi who currently resides at No. 4, Lane 42, Rue Loehr, in 1935. Zhang was 19 years old at the time. Zheng claimed that he was not yet married and pledged eternal love. They lived together at No. 76 Jing'an Villa. On August 18, 1938, both parties requested a certificate from lawyer Chen Yongsheng and signed a marriage agreement, setting a deadline of September 22 of the same year for a formal wedding. If there was a breach of contract, the man would compensate the woman 50,000 yuan for living expenses. Unexpectedly, Zheng broke the contract and engaged another woman. Zhang Xiuying learned of this and sent a letter asking him to fulfill the contract. Zheng replied that he had engaged another woman due to his parents' orders, and that he would pay the agreed compensation later, etc. However, Zheng still did not fulfill the contract. Therefore, Zhang Xiuying hired lawyer Ma Zhenzong to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against Zheng Zuoyi for breach of contract and recovery of 50,000 yuan in living expenses. Zheng hired lawyers Xue Dubi and Cao Shuling to file a defense and counterclaim, requesting the cancellation of the signed contract, etc. After Magistrate Wu Xiaoke held two hearings to summon witnesses and hear arguments, he announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled a date for judgment. The details have been reported in this newspaper twice. Yesterday was the scheduled date for judgment in this case. Magistrate Wu presided over the Seventh Civil Court and ruled that the defendant should compensate the plaintiff 50,000 yuan in national currency, and the litigation costs would be borne by the defendant.

Woman Carries Opium in Her Waistband

Sentenced to Five Months' Imprisonment

Ma Huiying (20 years old), a woman from Wuxi who resides at No. 79 Xinkang Lane, Connaught Road, was carrying 11 packets of opium in her waistband at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday. She was riding the No. 10 bus on Connaught Road, intending to deliver it to Li Huilin in the Datong Road area of Zhabei Road. Li agreed to pay her a reward of six yuan. Unexpectedly, Ma Huiying had not yet sat down on the bus, and the bulges in her waist were very obvious. She was noticed by female searcher Shi Lin of the police station, who searched her and found the opium in Ma's waistband. She was taken back to the police station for investigation. Yesterday morning, she was prosecuted in the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Magistrate Huang opened the court for trial. The defendant Ma Huiying admitted that Li Huilin had asked her to deliver it to Datong Road, and that she believed she would receive a reward afterward. After the court's deliberation and conclusion, Ma Huiying was found to have knowingly possessed opium and was sentenced to five months' imprisonment. If she chooses to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it will be calculated at two yuan per day. The opium will be confiscated and destroyed.

Pseudo Local Court to Dissolve

After the pseudo "Local Court President" Tu Fu was killed last month, the vacancy was temporarily filled by Fei Guoxi, the pseudo "court president," who was appointed by the pseudo "Minister of Judicial Administration" Hu Rentai of the pseudo "Reformed Government." During this transitional period, all civil and criminal litigation cases were seized by the pseudo "Shanghai Municipal Government Judicial Office." Therefore, the court has no official business to conduct. All pseudo-officials, large and small, are merely sitting idly by each day. Xi felt that this was quite boring and has submitted his resignation to the pseudo "Ministry of Judicial Administration." It is expected that the "court" may soon be dissolved.

### The "Chief of the Seventh Section of the Puppet Consolidated Tax Bureau," Tao Yuqi Dares Not Go Home. Three Youths Planned Murder and Sent a Warning Letter to the Police

Tao Yuqi, a Suzhou native residing at No. 17 Ruihua Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession, formerly a staff member in the Investigation Section of the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, specializing in investigating smuggled goods, lost his job once the war broke out, the National Army retreated, and the Shanghai Consolidated Tax Bureau moved west. After the traitor Shao Shijun organized the puppet "Consolidated Tax Bureau," Tao immediately betrayed his principles and jumped into the ranks of the newly wealthy, serving as the "Chief of the Seventh Section" in the puppet "Consolidated Tax Bureau," exploiting his position to the fullest extent. Therefore, he has accumulated considerable wealth, his social circle is wider than before, and he has purchased a new car for transportation. On the evening of the 27th of last month, at around 6 p.m., three youths in Western suits, armed with guns, came to Tao's house with the intention of killing him, but Tao discovered them, turned off the main power switch, causing the three youths to be unable to act in the pitch-black house, and they left through the back door. In a state of tension, Tao escaped through the front door and has not returned home. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now reported that Tao received two warning letters several days before the incident, urging him to repent and resign, but Tao ignored them and continued to go to the "Bureau" to "work" every day, leading to this decisive event. The truth remains to be verified.

### Finance Northern Speculators Are Still Advancing Vigorously Cash Prices First Rise and Then Fall

Yesterday, the cash Hechi grey market situation, although there was no excessive ups and downs, the situation was quite abrupt. Generally, it was strong first and then turned weak. Initially, because a certain customer purchased a large amount on behalf of northern speculators, and a certain silver shop also tracked and purchased on behalf of local gangs, the potential labor was quite strong for a time. Later, because the foreign exchange slightly reported loose hardness, and the hearts of all parties were inherently tired, ordinary retail investors sold off one after another, and the reaction line was weak. As a result, it only fell by one yuan. Transactions were strong in the morning and clear in the afternoon, with a total of 800 taels of transactions. Silver shop ornaments still did not see any historical movement. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold rose upward.

Hechi Grey Market Falls One Yuan

Since there was no initial transaction every morning (ten taels), it was not until about 10 o'clock that a certain broker was seen paying 50 taels to the northern customers, with an opening price of 2,130 yuan, which was similar to the previous day. After the opening, because a certain broker's purchase was more and more enthusiastic, coupled with a certain silver shop tracking and absorbing purchases on behalf of local gangs, although a certain Yuhao sold off, the momentary head room still felt that the demand was greater than the supply, and gradually rose. Qianduiye entered Jinhao 50 taels, priced at 31 yuan. Then, a certain broker also entered Jinhao 150 taels, priced at 32 yuan. Later, he also entered the cash shop 50 taels at the same price. Before long, a certain silver shop also entered the Yuhao 100 taels on behalf of the local gang, and 50 taels of the same industry at the same price. Suddenly, after a certain silver shop absorbed it, it suddenly sold it back to a certain broker for 50 taels, priced at 33 yuan. Qianduiye entered the silver shop gang 50 taels, 35 yuan. A certain broker then entered the securities gang 50 taels, 37 yuan. After that, foreign exchange slightly loosened, and people's hearts suddenly went downstream. Sellers were active, and those who entered were very lacking, and the decline was quite severe. Qianduiye mutually did 50 taels, 32 yuan. Later, Qianduiye sold to the silver shop gang 50 taels at 2,128 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because foreign exchange was sluggish and constant, and the supply and demand between the two sides was even more sparse, the transaction was sparse. First, Qianduiye mutually did 50 taels, 28 yuan. Later, Qianduiye sold to Jinhao 50 taels at 2,129 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by one yuan compared to the previous day, a difference of nine yuan for the whole day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 2,140 yuan, and the receiving price was 2,125 yuan. The current margin is listed at 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there is no opening.

Ornament Exchange Price Still Not Changed

The exchange price per tael of silver shop ornaments has not changed, Datonghang is still hanging 216 yuan, Xin Tonghang is 214 yuan, and the receiving price is 208 yuan.

English Pure Gold Continues to Rise by Two Pence

The listed customs gold also rose by 2 li, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 1 yuan and 3 jiao, totaling 1,206 yuan and 9 jiao.

### Hong Kong and Foreign Banks Eagerly Sell Foreign Exchange, but Settlement Demand Remains Strong, Leading to Initial Loosening Followed by Equilibrium; HSBC Netherlands Telegraphic Transfer at 6.25

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw a surge in selling from Hong Kong and British HSBC banks, as well as other foreign banks. Although foreign banks and foreign exchange firms were eager to purchase on behalf of Tianjin foreign merchants, banks, and Chinese banks, the market still felt oversupplied. This led to a temporary loosening of the upward momentum. The exchange rate for British gold sovereigns reached 8 pence 140625, and the US dollar also rose to 15.90625 yuan. However, sudden settlement demand from oil companies and other foreign firms, as well as purchasing settlements from foreign power companies and Chinese cotton and yarn merchants, quickly brought the market back to equilibrium. As a result, there were no significant gains or losses. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained largely unchanged due to balanced supply and demand.

In the morning, London's near-term large-denomination notes contracted by 0.125, and forward rates also decreased by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained unchanged. The price of gold in London rose by 2 pence. The exchange rate for British pounds against US dollars was up by 6 mills, unchanged against the French franc, and down slightly by 0.0625 against the Shanghai dollar. The US dollar rose by 0.1875 against the British pound, rose by 0.0625 against the French franc, and was unchanged against the Shanghai dollar. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained fixed. The opening selling prices for banks in the morning were 8 pence 125 for British gold sovereigns and 15.875 yuan for US dollars, on par with the previous closing prices. After the opening, foreign HSBC banks sold British gold sovereigns to Chinese banks and foreign exchange firms at 8 pence 140625, causing a slight loosening of the upward momentum. HSBC announced its listed exchange rates, with the Netherlands telegraphic transfer rate increasing by 6.25, while other rates remained unchanged. The Silver Equalization Tax was announced to be reduced by half a point, totaling 7.5%. Later, Hong Kong electric companies and foreign banks sold US dollars to Chinese banks at 15.90625 yuan, maintaining a loose state. Subsequently, oil companies and power companies suddenly engaged in aggressive purchases. Texaco and Asiatic settled with HSBC at 8 pence 125 for British gold sovereigns. Following this, a power company purchased US dollars from a Sino-Belgian bank at 15.875 yuan, reinforcing the upward momentum.

### Securities: Cotton Yarn In, Government Bonds Out; Market Prices Largely Unaffected; Optimism for the Future Remains Unchanged

In the unofficial securities market yesterday, after intense competition between bulls and bears, the bulls gradually gained the upper hand. Market prices shifted from weak to firm and stable. Market prices have been suppressed for several days due to the Wu faction of yarn merchants selling government bonds to bolster cotton yarn. Over the past few days, sales have reached three to four hundred thousand yuan, yet the overall appearance has not wavered. Much of this released capital has been gradually absorbed by smaller financial institutions, and the environment shows signs of improvement. The concession issue has been peacefully resolved, and banks are offering discounts of 5% on the 7th installment of Series A winning lottery tickets and the interest coupons of the 6th installment of various unified government bonds. This is a definitive fact. The German envoy traveled from Chongqing to Japan, raising hopes for a Sino-Japanese settlement. Furthermore, large international loans are strengthening the stability of China's legal tender. Yesterday's performance, transitioning from weak to firm, suggests a significant rebound is imminent. At the opening, #38 first sold over two hundred thousand yuan of Series B bonds, followed by #10. The market price decreased slightly, only by two or three cents. Simultaneously, #35 took advantage of the low prices to buy a significant amount. #38 then switched to purchasing Series A bonds, also amounting to over two hundred thousand yuan. Yue Mao, Northern Gang #11, and Xiang Feng also absorbed a considerable amount. #46 and Xie Da still made small sales, but retail demand remained strong. Near the close, sellers began to withdraw, and Series E bonds rebounded from 5.80 yuan to 6.10 yuan. At closing, demand remained high, with bids at 0.02 yuan but no supply. Consequently, other varieties also showed signs of strengthening. Ultimately, Series B and D bonds increased by 0.05 yuan, Series C and E remained unchanged, and Series A decreased slightly by 0.05 yuan. Total transactions amounted to approximately 700,000 yuan. A summary is provided below:

In stock trading, a small number of shares of Dasheng First Factory were traded at 23.50 yuan. Shares of Nanshi Huashang Electric Power were bid at 5.20 yuan, but no supply was available.

On March 1st (Wednesday), the listed prices for London-traded Chinese foreign currency bonds showed that only the Anglo-German Continuing Loan and British bonds experienced a decline of half a pound, priced at 73.50 pounds, due to the interest payment period approaching. (This loan bears interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum, payable in two installments on March 1st and September 1st each year. Each installment pays 2 pounds and 5 shillings per 100-pound bond. Typically, the market price should also fall by 2 pounds and 0 shillings. However, today's telegram only showed a drop of half a pound. If the telegram is accurate, then the market price has actually increased by 1.50 pounds compared to the previous day. Readers are advised to take note.) All other prices remained unchanged. The supply of physical goods in London was limited, with only the Railway Bonds slightly embellished. 5,000 pounds of the Hu-Guang Railway Bonds (non-German issued) were sold at 21 pounds, on par with the market price. Additionally, 3,000 pounds of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Continuing Bonds (German issued) were sold at 15 pounds and 15 shillings, down 5 shillings from the listed price. Market sentiment was sluggish, and the foundation seemed weak.

On March 1st (Wednesday), the listed prices for shares of British Far East companies in London showed that the Kaiping Mining (bearer shares) rose by 1.5 pence, priced at 17 shillings and 4.5 pence. The Kuala Lumpur Rubber shares rose by 7.5 pence, priced at 20 shillings. The rest showed no changes.

### Silk and Tea: User Silk Prices Approaching the 2,000 Yuan Mark; Yokohama Silk Market Remains Closed

The international silk market in Yokohama was ordered to halt auctions the night before due to excessive price surges. The decision to halt silk market trading is due to an increase in price. One side of this issue is demand, another is economic stagnation, anxiousness, and fear that inflation has already started in Japan. New York and Lyon silk markets continued to reach new peaks yesterday. Japanese silk 83 was up another 8 points, 75 Japanese silk was up 9 points, Shanghai silk was up 5 points, and Guangdong silk was up 7 points. Lyon Japanese silk was up 1.50 French francs, Shanghai silk was up 3 French francs, B-mark silk was up 4.50 French francs, and Guangdong silk was up 4 French francs. The New York Exchange's near-term contracts were up 7 points, and forward contracts were up 3 points, with extremely active trading. Yesterday's trading volume opened at 1,980 bundles, a phenomenon unseen in years.

The local silk market is experiencing strong price increases, but also significant disorder. Buyers and sellers alike are disoriented, and occasional transactions lack any consistency, with price differences of 50-60 yuan for the same grade of silk between morning and afternoon. As a result, prudent individuals are temporarily ceasing trading. The price of B-mark white silk has already been sold at 1,940 yuan. A silk price of 2,000 yuan was once considered a dream, but is now within reach. As for raw silk trading, Zha Qi Yin Zhuang has shifted from firm to clear. Sales of British and American silk have ceased early. The user silk market saw trading of 50-60 bundles, with asking prices reportedly approaching 2,000 yuan.

Yesterday, 162 bales of lake silk and 86 bales of silk waste were shipped to Europe.

Additionally, 562 boxes of tea were also shipped to Europe.

### Grains: Flour Sales Increase Significantly After Mill Price Reduction

The flour market continues to soften, with sporadic sales from both Northern and Southern merchants, lacking any large-scale transactions. Rumors suggest that two ships carrying foreign wheat have been fixed and will arrive soon, causing buyers to become more cautious. Mills are unwilling to further reduce prices, resulting in a transaction volume of less than 30,000 bags, handled piecemeal by Northern and Southern merchants. Local trading has increased after the mill price reduction of 0.05 yuan, reaching nearly 10,000 bags. There are rumors that mills may further lower prices by 0.05 yuan for merchant orders, making it difficult to be optimistic about the market. Yesterday, 3,800 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin, 500 bags to Yantai, and 16,800 bags to Hong Kong for transshipment to Yantai.

The wheat market lacks any distinctive features, with limited supply and thin inventory. Sellers are holding firm on prices, but rumors of fixed foreign wheat shipments arriving soon are impacting the outlook for local wheat. Mills are showing little interest, with only 300 bags of Chuzhou wheat traded at 6.80 yuan, purchased by Fuxin Mill. The market is still brewing.

### Glutinous Rice Opens at 16.70 Yuan, Up Half a Yuan Significantly

After a continuous surge in price, glutinous rice prices rose even more sharply yesterday. This is due to supply disruptions since the Lunar New Year, limited arrivals of new rice, and increased demand, resulting in a persistent supply shortage. Yesterday's opening price reached 16.70 yuan, a significant increase of half a yuan. As for thick and thin japonica rice, arrivals remain scarce. Only the third shipment arrived downstream, with 500-600 bags transported by boat and over 3,000 bags transported by rail to the port. Major hoarders continue to show strong interest, and local stores are also increasingly enthusiastic, maintaining a tight situation. The market continues to rise by 0.10 to 0.15 yuan, with Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian following suit by a few cents to a dime.

### Customer Xian Rice Inquiries from Shantou and Xiamen

There were inquiries about customer Xian rice from Shantou and Xiamen merchants. The market continues to rise. However, there is a shortage of high-quality rice, and owners are reluctant to sell, causing high-quality Wu Xian rice to rise to 11.75 yuan, and ordinary market rice to rise to 11.30-11.40 yuan. No transactions have been made for Nanjing high-quality Xian rice due to price disagreements. Over 3,000 bags were traded in the unified market, with prices increasing by 0.04-0.05 yuan to 0.10 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Shortage, Market Prices Tight

Soybean prices have risen repeatedly due to strong reports of origin prices and steady oilseed prices. Spot soybeans from Dalian are scarce. Japanese merchants continue to actively sell futures, with eight trucks of Sipingjie soybeans for April delivery priced at 8.07-8.08 yuan. Return shipments for ten-day delivery are priced at 8.10 yuan. In other transactions, over 500 bags of Chongming sand soybeans were purchased by Xiamen merchants from local markets. Over 200 bags of Du soybeans were traded, with the market becoming increasingly tight.

### Declining Market Sentiment in Wheat Bran; Bulls Disappointed

Yesterday's wheat bran market showed signs of loosening. Prices in Qingdao plummeted by 0.60 yuan, causing the bulls to lose momentum and easing market sentiment. However, mills remain closed, preventing any domestic sales. Only 500 small bags of Fuxin bran were returned at 4.37 yuan, and 600 small bags of Fufeng bran were returned at 4.35 yuan. The future market situation remains volatile, with over 140,000-150,000 bags of futures needing to be sold.

### North-South Goods: Red Dates Continue to Rise Steadily

Red dates, which bottomed out at 25-26 yuan last winter, rebounded to 27-28 yuan and have continued to rise this spring. Initially at 31 yuan, then 33 yuan, yesterday saw a batch of higher-quality dates traded at 35 yuan, nearly 10 yuan above the lowest price. Currently, merchants from Hong Kong and Shantou are showing interest. With limited market inventory, continued tightness is likely.

### Sugar Market: Limited Domestic Sugar Supply

Domestic sugar transactions remain sporadic. Yesterday, Chaozhou merchants offered 72 bags of Ming Cheng Zhuang Zheng Mian red sugar, with excellent color, priced at 16 yuan, down slightly by 0.02 yuan from before. Dozens of bags of Huanggang Qing sugar were priced at 15.50 yuan. Some superior rock white and ice flower white sugar were offered, with prices remaining unchanged. Twenty bags of miscellaneous inferior white sugar were priced at 18.80 yuan. Shipments from Jinan have been delayed en route and are expected to arrive today. There are 2,070 bags of sugar arriving from Shantou.

### Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn Becomes a Speculative Game; Market Fluctuations Extremely Rapid; A Rabbit-Like Ascent and Hawk-Like Descent

Yesterday's yarn market, which had been bullish the day before, turned bearish again, resembling a rabbit-like ascent and hawk-like descent. While actual demand has decreased somewhat, purchasing from Northern and Southern merchants remains relatively strong. For example, Tianjin merchants have a substantial demand for 10-count coarse yarn and are actively searching the market. Therefore, the price of coarse yarn has not only not fallen, but has become tighter. Mills have long stopped spinning this product, and mill inventories are low. Hoarders only hold 20-count yarn and have no intention of hoarding 10-count yarn. As a result, market prices are strong when business picks up. Interest from Yunnan has waned slightly, but overall purchases are still decent. However, there is excessive internal speculative trading among market participants. People gather in the market, rushing to buy when prices are tight and quickly selling when prices loosen. This is similar to exchange-traded standard yarn, with similar volatility. Therefore, 20-count Tiannv yarn has become a representative standard, experiencing significant fluctuations. Recently, there has been increased speculative trading, leading to more rapid price changes and increased transaction volume.

Regarding the spot yarn situation, the market opened weak in the morning due to merchants temporarily suspending purchases after bulk acquisitions the previous day. Speculation arose that actual demand had ceased, causing the market to stagnate. Retailers began to sell off, immediately lowering prices by 0.075 yuan, with 20-count Zhi Ma yarn at 402 yuan. With few buyers, a speculative wind arose, gradually decreasing prices and breaking through the 400-yuan mark. The lowest price was 397 yuan, with warehouse receipts traded at 394.5 yuan. The low price triggered buyers to return and purchase, recovering to 401 yuan by closing. The market weakened again in the afternoon, falling to 399 yuan before recovering to 400 yuan at closing. In total, merchants purchased 2,830 bales. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn fell by 2.75 yuan compared to the previous day, Tiannv yarn fell by 2.5 yuan, Shuang Di Qiu yarn fell by 1 yuan, and Te Yu Cheng remained flat. However, 10-count coarse yarn rose by 2 yuan due to strong demand. Dasheng Mill offered 450 bales of 10-count Hong Kuixing yarn at 285 yuan. Yong An Mill offered 300 bales of 10-count Jia He yarn at 281 yuan. Xin Yu Mill offered 150 bales of 10-count Di Qiu yarn at 293 yuan. An Da Mill offered 250 bales of 20-count Fei Hu yarn at 394-395 yuan. Today, 390 pieces of yarn were exported to Tianjin and 25 pieces to Yantai. The purchase volume of each merchant is recorded on the left.

The Japanese yarn market is calm. Apart from relatively active buying from Tianjin merchants, there were few other transactions. The spot price for 20-count Shui Yue yarn is 336 yuan, and the spot price for 20-count Lan Feng yarn is 330 yuan.

### Large Batches of Yao Cotton Arrive; Local Cotton Trading Expands

Local cotton business has suddenly become active, with both mills and factories in need. Transactions are lively, and market prices are stable. Due to rising foreign cotton prices and reduced exchange rates, leading to higher purchase prices, the momentum of local cotton is increasing. Arrivals, however, remain minimal. Available goods are not particularly outstanding. Yao clothing, however, has completed procedures, with arrivals to Shanghai daily. Yesterday, three ships carrying a total of 17,000-18,000 bales of cotton arrived. This cotton is distributed and sold to manufacturers by cotton merchants. The trading volume and market prices for spot cotton are listed on the left.

### Foreign Cotton Demand Remains Active at Factories

Foreign cotton market prices rose slightly in New York in the morning. However, due to continuous cotton market increases for two weeks, there was some reactionary profit-taking yesterday, as well as short-covering and selling on Wall Street. The cotton market fell slightly by two to four points. The Indian cotton market is exceptionally firm, rising another rupee yesterday. The Mumbai market is closed today, but forecasts remain high. Egyptian cotton rose by 7 points. Yesterday, exchange rates loosened slightly, reducing legal tender costs. US and Brazilian cotton fell by 0.10 yuan per dan (unit of weight), Egyptian cotton fell by 0.20 yuan, and Indian cotton rose by over 0.40 yuan.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading remained lively yesterday. Although Indian prices have been rising for days, they are still relatively cheaper than domestic cotton. As a result, factories are conducting some foreign cotton transactions. An Da Mill acquired 300 bales of Ping Guoer cotton, with delivery to the factory costing only 59 yuan, comparable to the special Yao cotton offered at over 66 yuan the day before. Furthermore, Indian cotton has lower moisture content, allowing for water weight rebates. Shen Xin purchased 200 bales of North Brazilian cotton, arriving at the end of the month, with delivery to the factory costing only 81 yuan, significantly cheaper than Tongzhou American cotton. Xin Yu purchased 1,000 bales of White Rock cotton, with delivery to the factory costing 73 yuan, and 500 bales of lower-grade US cotton at 74 yuan. Xin Sheng purchased 1,000 bales of lower-grade Peng Jiapu cotton at 71.5 yuan. Chang Xing Cotton also ordered 500 bales of Peng Jiapu cotton at 71 yuan. On the Japanese factory side, Gong Da purchased 500 bales of Indian cotton, Yu Feng purchased 500 bales of Indian cotton, Shanghai purchased 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, and Rihua purchased 500 bales of Indian cotton. Yesterday's foreign cotton prices, converted to delivered factory prices, are listed below.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods Sell Briskly; Domestic Cloth Follows Suit

Domestic cloth is showing signs of recovery due to the rebound in Eastern piece goods made from Japanese cotton yarn and the support of current sales from merchants. The purchasing appetite from Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Eastern regions has strengthened, and market sentiment is bullish. However, market attacks remain extremely chaotic. Morning spot prices for Tianjin Heng Yuan Mill's pao che fine cloth were 12.60-12.65 yuan, while list prices were 12.90 yuan. There were also fluctuations of 0.10 yuan for Da Yi Gui fine cloth. Many merchants are playing price games. Prices for coarse cloth and fine twill cloth remain firm. Merchants from Wen and Yong (Wenzhou and Ningbo) purchased over 200 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, bleached goods, poplin, etc. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan continued to purchase 150-160 pieces of printed sateen, bleached cloth, colored cloth, and twill. Merchants from Guangdong purchased over 4,000 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. Wholesale sales of colored cloth in the local market are strongest in Subei's Shuyang and Funing regions. Local underwear businesses are actively purchasing plain cloth, patterned cloth, and new patterned poplin, reaching a transaction volume of 2,000-3,000 pieces. Bleaching and dyeing factories have acquired nearly 5,000 pieces of gray cloth, including fine twill, patterned bleached cloth, and twill, both spot and futures.

Yesterday, Eastern white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill sold well, with spot and futures purchases reaching over 1,000 pieces due to Tianjin merchants' purchases. Selling prices rose sharply, increasing by 0.10 yuan per piece. Local market sales were only 500-600 bales, but traders were actively opening spot and futures contracts with various foreign firms. Ito's alone offered around 1,000 pieces of fine cloth, including Caiqiu, Feiyu, Longtou, and Laba brands. Other Eastern cotton and Nisshin cotton also had several hundred pieces sold. Spot prices for Caiqiu and Feiyu brands were 12.30 yuan per piece, and the current month's futures were 12.35 yuan per piece. Spot and futures prices differed by only 0.05 yuan per piece. Therefore, traders are continuing to purchase the recent goods, and the market is strong and firm.

Today, 170 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin and 23 pieces to Yantai.

### Oilcake: Soybean Cake Continues to Rise; Raw Soybean Oil Rebounds in the Afternoon

The peanut oil market is quite chaotic, brewing for a long time, but ultimately shifting from weak to tight, increasing by 0.30-0.40 yuan compared to the previous market. Transactions included 700 pieces of Jiaozhou oil and 200 cans of Qingdao oil (see market price section for details). The soybean oil market was sluggish in the morning due to lackluster sales, but sentiment improved in the afternoon due to continuous increases in Dalian. Prices followed suit, increasing by a fraction of a yuan. Transactions included 400 barrels of Dalian oil, 200 pieces of Dalian oil, and 100 barrels for delivery next March. Other transactions included 210 pieces of Yanqi and Lianqi oil delivered. Soybean cake prices have risen sharply due to continuous demand from Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Shantou. The market continues to rise by 0.05 yuan. Transactions included 500 pieces of Da You Four brand cake at 3.45 yuan, 2,000 pieces of Pu Li Four brand cake also at 3.45 yuan, and 9,000 pieces of Jiang Bei small cake at 0.0659 yuan.

Yesterday, 2,000 cans and 200 baskets of raw oil arrived from Yantai, and 800 cans arrived from Qingdao. Qingdao also shipped 800 bags of raw peanuts.

### Wenzhou Charcoal, Previously Banned for Export, Causes Supply Shortage; Prices Soar

Wenzhou charcoal, previously banned for export, has resulted in a complete cut-off of supply. At the end of the previous lunar year, Shanghai's inventory was only over 12,000 dan, causing panic. Red Traders have been vigorously bidding up prices. 35-pound Da Qing Jian charcoal is now at 4.20 yuan per dan, Ping Lou Qi is at 3.80 yuan, and Huang Yan bamboo charcoal is at 3.30 yuan. Prices have risen by 0.30-0.40 yuan. However, the association has received a telegram from Wenzhou approving exports. Subsequent shipments will be arriving in Shanghai in large quantities, and the market price of charcoal is expected to fall.

### Imports and Exports: Native Products Shipped to Europe and Africa

Yesterday, 16 pieces of human hair and 36 pieces of egg yolk powder were shipped to Europe. 127 bundles of tobacco leaves were shipped to Egypt.

### National Education Conference

— Mao Lie

The news of the National Education Conference being held in Chongqing filled me with great joy.

In this period of constant gunfire and widespread devastation, with everyone focused on resisting the enemy, it seems that military affairs are paramount and everything else becomes secondary. Yet we are now holding this conference, which shows that our war effort has a comprehensive plan. The fact that all affairs can proceed as usual is a sign of our confidence in ultimate victory. This is the first reason.

The attendees of this conference can be said to bring together national education administrators and renowned educators in one place, with virtually no omissions. This further demonstrates that the strength of our central government and our spirit of unity have not been weakened, but rather have increased significantly. This is the second reason.

These are the two reasons for my joy.

We cannot yet know what will be discussed at this conference, or what proposals will be presented. However, I can confidently predict that its proceedings will be smooth and its results will be satisfactory. Because in this time and in this situation, who would not work together harmoniously, discuss things humbly, and devote their wisdom and ability to serving the country!

I am not an educator, so I have no special opinions to offer to the conference. Moreover, the "Education News" section of this newspaper is filled with the erudite opinions of various educators, and the experts attending the conference will surely have profound plans that far surpass anything I could imagine. Therefore, I, perhaps along with the general non-educator public, can only listen quietly to their brilliant arguments and await their success.

However, even a fool's thoughts can be worthwhile. I believe that what is most important now is to focus on the "war effort." Education that has already been damaged must of course be restored to prosperity. Education that is proceeding normally should be reformed or improved without delay, so it is practical.

Reports indicate that Zhejiang has a "Wartime University" and Jiangsu has "Mobile Schools," and that many other specialized schools have been established to adapt to the times. I fully support these efforts. I hope that schools throughout the country will adhere to this principle: to promote the strength of the war effort.

Therefore, I urge our educators on this "isolated island" to also give it more consideration!

### A Record of Mr. Cao Juren (Part 1)

— Wu Zijin

1.  The Green Bamboo Cloth Gown

Mr. Cao perpetually wore a green bamboo cloth gown and a pair of unvarnished black leather shoes; sometimes perhaps two pairs of black cloth shoes. This society values outward appearance, and this is where he suffered.

At banquets, even when lecturing at Jinan University, the old-fashioned guests and the playboy-like students would invariably mistake him for a lowly servant: a tea boy. He humorously remarked, "Sometimes I really want to wear a smart Western suit and a pair of old-fashioned glasses." But he remained, through and through, in that green bamboo cloth gown, irrespective of the lush spring, sweltering summer, bleak autumn, or frigid winter.

This man commands respect; to capture his essence, the word "simplicity" must be emphasized.

2.  The "Mouse" of Scholarship

To borrow a phrase from Anatole France, this man is a "library mouse." This not only means that he voraciously devoured books but also that his scholarship was as "precise" and "detailed" as a mouse.

This man grew up amidst stacks of old books; naturally, he spent considerable energy on "old paper." But he was not a submissive prisoner of this "national treasure"; on the contrary, he treated it like an impartial and astute judge.

There are people in the world whose vision is like a vegetable oil lamp, who revere all ancient books as scriptures, nodding and swaying endlessly, unaware of whether they are being duped. This man despised such pedantic scholars. Carlyle said, "The ignorant are below, the thoughtful are in the middle, and the observers are above." Scholarly pursuits cannot do without discerning vision; pedantic scholars only know how to blindly read, lacking any critical spirit, muttering and mumbling their entire lives. Stacks upon stacks of ancient books crush them into inferior, pedantic scholars. "Scholars and licentiates," he said, "are all useless treasures." Is this statement not excessive?

The second type of scholar he disdained was the "bookcase" that "absorbs knowledge like the Gobi Desert absorbs water, yet cannot spout a clear spring onto the ground." It is said that in his early years, when studying in Hangzhou, this man greatly admired the textual critic Mr. Shan Bu'an, but an "allegiance that lasted for ten years" eventually collapsed entirely because Mr. Shan was merely a bookcase.

"My second encounter with Master Shan Bu'an was in the West Lake Provincial Library (in 1927). This encounter completely disillusioned me. He was so erudite, yet so lacking in his own insights; he read a great deal, but never organized it into a system." (Literary Jottings: My Reading Experiences.)

The French essayist Michel de Montaigne ridiculed such bookcases as being like someone needing fire who goes to a neighbor to get it but, upon seeing a blazing fire, stays there to warm himself, forgetting to bring it home. "Do we think we have done enough just by hoarding the opinions and knowledge of others?" he questioned. "What good does it do us if our bellies are full of meat? If we cannot digest it, if we cannot transform it into our own, if it cannot increase our growth and strength?" (See On Education.) The most important thing in reading is to never lock the dregs of others' thoughts in one's own mind. Montaigne, with his extensive knowledge and insightful views, is admirable precisely for this reason.

Mr. Cao was also this type of scholar. The admirable aspects of his scholarship can be summarized in his own words on writing books: (1) Always doubt the ancients and ancient books; (2) Have the courage to betray one's teachers and elders; (3) Organize one's own system of thought.

### Five Points on "Scolding People"

— Qin Lao

"Scolding people" seems like bad behavior. However, there is absolutely no one who has never scolded anyone in their life. Moreover, as long as one is not drunk or insane, when a person dares to scold others, it is a sign of courage. If the scolding is justified, the person who can scold is a person of great integrity.

Here are two people: one scolding people with righteous indignation; the other bowing and scraping to everyone, saying nothing but "Admiration, admiration." Let's compare them; what do we see?

However, scolding can be harsh, but it must not be slanderous; it can be exaggerated, but it must not be fabricated.

Harsh and exaggerated scolding can become literature; slander and fabrication can never become literature.

At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the members of the Fushe Society scolded Ruan Hu Zi. Ruan Hu Zi's retaliatory measures were slander and fabrication. At that time, Ruan Hu Zi was victorious. But the Fushe Society's writings that scolded Ruan Hu Zi have been passed down to the present, and even Ruan Hu Zi, who was indeed a literary figure, left behind not a single word of his slander and fabrication, except for a story that is still being scolded.

However, there is also a great taboo: trying to force someone who is not a clown into becoming one, even if one has great talent, will not work. The result often does not go as intended.

In the writings of a Ming Dynasty "remnant" who surrendered to the Qing Dynasty, there is a poem mocking Li Zicheng. The last two lines are:

"The rebel does not seek pleasure in sights and sounds,
But single-mindedly strives to cause the Ming's demise."

The author probably thought it was witty. But the first line precisely describes Li Zicheng's virtues, and the second line is completely false. Everyone knows that it was people like Wu Sangui who "single-mindedly strove to cause the Ming's demise," and everyone knows that Li Zicheng was a Han Chinese who was exterminated by the Qing Dynasty. This wit is not witty at all.

If one is not righteously indignant and wants to scold people, even if one writes it out in literary form, it will not become good literature.

However, there is another great taboo. It is still about a Ming Dynasty "remnant" who surrendered to the Qing Dynasty: Qian Qianyi was imprisoned by the Qianlong Emperor. Because none of his fellow townsmen came to visit him, he scolded all the people of Changshu. That was also written out in literary form. But it didn't work; that kind of thing is just street scolding.

Having become a traitor and relying on the power of the new master to act as a bully in one's hometown, one then hopes that the townspeople will inquire after one's well-being when one falls out of favor. The idea is certainly safe, but it only further exposes one's shamelessness.

To scold people, one must first not be scolded by others. Otherwise, "scolding people" really becomes an act of no integrity.

A person who truly scolds people will not bow and scrape. If one scolds people while bowing and scraping, it is not only ridiculous but can also cause trouble. If one is not careful and says "Admire" when one means "Bastard," one will be slapped in the face.

### The Propaganda War in Spain

— Translated by Fan Ke

Modern technology has created two weapons in addition to the already extensive armory of war. These newest types of munitions, unlike tanks, bombers, or hand grenades, neither kill nor injure. They are aerial leaflet bombs and loudspeakers.

Behind any front line in Spain today, no more than a few yards apart, there is a house or wooden shed, its walls riddled with bullet holes, containing a primitive printing press, not assembled by experts. A soldier bends over the machine, working on it. He has received crash training and knows how to print booklets by the dozens.

The contents of these propaganda items vary greatly; sometimes they are denials of statements from the enemy general staff, promises of a near-heavenly life to soldiers who desert to the other side, and sometimes excerpts from the speeches of famous politicians.

A large aerial leaflet bomb can hold four hundred booklets at a time and is flown over enemy trenches to be distributed. The leaflet bomb comes down from the sky with a crackling sound, trailing a long white plume to the enemy lines, where it explodes. Pale leaflets float to the ground and into the hands of enemy soldiers a minute later. On some days, twenty to fifty leaflet bombs fall in the "no man's land" separating government and rebel forces.

In terms of weapons of war, radio may be even more effective. Various broadcasting tools are available at the front lines, with power supplied by an old-fashioned motor. In the middle of the night, the trenches suddenly resound with a marching tune or a tango, or the melancholic tune of a Spanish folk song. Soldiers crave any kind of entertainment; they listen in silence.

The music suddenly stops, and a voice booms through the night. It is the voice of the enemy, telling the other side that they are fighting on the wrong side, inciting them to rebel and desert, urging them to take advantage of the darkness to escape to the other side, and promising them a wonderful life. They reiterate all of this in every imaginable language.

In recent months, the eclectic field of propaganda work has been greatly modernized. Huge, new propaganda trucks will soon be seen at the front lines, equipped with all the latest mechanical inventions, with both sound broadcasting and receiving capabilities. Equipped with several subwoofers, sometimes as many as fourteen loudspeakers, under cover of darkness, these vehicles drive close to the enemy's front lines, set up the loudspeakers behind strategic positions, and begin broadcasting. (The trucks have chains connected to the loudspeakers.)

Both aerial leaflet bombs and loudspeakers have been successful for both sides in the Spanish war. The enemy's propaganda bombs pass each other in the air over "no man's land," followed by a "paper war." What soldiers find most annoying is both sides broadcasting at the same time. The result is that the voices of both sides cancel each other out, and the speakers of both sides cannot be heard clearly. The sound of the loudspeakers can reach a mile and a half, but the strange intermingling of sounds when both sides broadcast at the same time is enough to drive the people in the trenches crazy.

This is the propaganda war! A fierce war, whether spoken or written, but more welcome than bullets and bombs. (Translated from "National Literary Magazine")

### Stranger

— Ke Huan

Loneliness gently knocks on the heart of the stranger,

Telling him:

You don't know anyone!

Streams of gazes shoot onto the stranger's face,

Conveying to his heart,

The lonely tree branch has arrived!

The blood of his entire body rushes towards the sea,

In the end—

"Hermit", "Superman",

Unwilling to "go with the flow"?

Or—

Accept those gazes and join the great group?

The stranger is sometimes composed,

Sometimes smiling,

His heart has become a battlefield!

A Mid-Length Novel

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

There was a moment of silence, everyone bowed their heads in thought, not saying a word. After a while, Regiment Adjutant Liang finally spoke:

"To wipe out this batch of bandits would not be difficult, but to allow the enemy to benefit as a result would be somewhat unworthy, so this matter cannot be resolved by force. I think it's best to use soft tactics, and properly persuade them to reform and start anew."

"I think so too," Regiment Commander Ye nodded and said, "But I'm afraid their wild nature is hard to tame. I've heard that the people within them are very mixed and impure; I'm afraid it will be very difficult to use personal charm to influence them."

"I have a plan here," Staff Officer Zhu suddenly stood up and said, "As the saying goes, 'To catch bandits, first catch the leader.' We might as well first issue a notice, inviting One-Eyed Li to come here for a banquet, and secretly set up an ambush. When he arrives, we'll give a signal by throwing a cup on the table and arrest him. His subordinates are all a ragtag bunch, and 'a snake cannot move without a head,' so at that time, we can reorganize or disband them at our discretion."

"That method is not bad, but the worry is that he may not be willing to be fooled," Regiment Commander Ye said with a smile.

"Whether he comes or not, we might as well try it first. This is called 'courtesy before force.' If he doesn't come, it's not too late for us to devise another plan," Regiment Adjutant Liang also agreed with Staff Officer Zhu's plan, helping from the side.

Everyone agreed with this proposal, so Regiment Commander Ye chose a date, prepared a red invitation, and ordered a soldier to send it to Tiaoxi Town, inviting One-Eyed Li to the banquet. To avoid arousing his suspicion, even his strategist, nicknamed Dog-Headed Advisor Xiao Mazi, was invited.

After sending out the invitations, Regiment Commander Ye did not think that this was the end of the matter, but continued to plan meticulously with Regiment Adjutant Liang and Staff Officer Zhu, how to arrange the ambush, what conditions to propose to One-Eyed Li at the banquet, and even what preparations should be made in the event of failure.

### The Pain of Suffering from Neurasthenia in Married Life

The happiness of married life, upon careful study, is truly a right unique to healthy people. If any morbid state occurs, it is best to stop the process. If one proceeds with coercion, one cannot avoid experiencing pain. Now, let us take the common neurasthenia as an example. On the surface, neurasthenia may not show any abnormalities at all. Men after marriage are more likely to suffer from this disease, especially those in middle age. The causes are mostly due to early self-indulgence in masturbation or nocturnal emission, or post-marital debauchery and indulgence. In addition, worries and injuries, post-illness imbalances, and congenital weakness may also occasionally occur. As a result, the reproductive gland fluid in the body stagnates or dries up, the metabolic rate decreases, and the nervous system, deprived of adequate nutrition and adjustment, enters a state of weakness. Therefore, on the brain nerve side, there are often headaches, forgetfulness, and insomnia, but in this spring season, it is very tiring and sleepy. The pain of being unable to sleep when one is tired is indescribable! And with a little bit of brain use, one immediately feels golden flowers disturbing one's vision, and the ears sound like jade pendants, sometimes even fainting! On the spinal nerve side, there are often backaches, sore backs, and weakness in the limbs. If one works hard even a little, one feels exhausted and unable to support oneself. As for the sexual nerve side, the symptoms of nocturnal emission, seminal emission upon seeing the opposite sex, premature ejaculation, impotence, dissipation of energy, and prolonged infertility appear one after another. Therefore, even in this gentle and warm spring, on clear moonlit nights, how can the married life be harmonious and fulfilling? However, the youth of the beautiful wife is wasted, how can one not feel sad! The small things become the complaints of women in their boudoirs, and there is no joy in the family. The big things become anger and resentment, and they even have affairs and elope with others, or openly meet their husbands in court and eloquently sue for divorce! This kind of husband, suffering such a tragic life, what is the pain in his heart like!

Regarding the effective treatment of the above-mentioned symptoms, it has long been believed by world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience that taking "Reproductive Element," a preparation made from the reproductive glands of strong animals, is the most effective and specific treatment. This agent can produce essence and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate blood, and nourish the nerves within a day and night after taking it, so that the symptoms are immediately reduced. If one can continue to take it, the above-mentioned symptoms can be completely cured in a short period of time, and the body will become healthier, with the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating the youth. This drug has also been tested by the famous German doctor (Miller) Meyers, proving that its quality is pure, its medicinal properties are mild, and its tonic effect is active. There are absolutely no side effects such as irritating the stomach and intestines and exciting the nerves after taking it, so it is determined to be the best of endocrine or youth gland preparations. Since its invention, it has been popular all over the world and is praised by all pharmacies. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Heimitu's Essence-Solidifying Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage, so that the effect is even faster. If patients can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by expert doctors, and then use scientific methods such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, they can be guaranteed to be cured.

### Methods for Shaping Beautiful Breasts, Faces, and Hips

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Health and beauty, I think every woman yearns for and pursues them! Indeed, a healthy and beautiful woman is truly a treasure of society, the soul in the hearts of men, and the mother of the great era to come. If she marries a good man, the love between husband and wife will be deep, they will have clever children, and they will have a happy family. How glorious and happy life is! But how can a woman gain health and beauty? This is a problem that we must urgently solve.

The wheel of the times turns unstoppably, and the concept of feminine beauty has abandoned the hypocritical, delicate, and morbid beauty of the past. Now, the emphasis is on the healthy beauty of developed feminine characteristics. The main of these characteristics are the breasts, the face, and the hips. The development of the breasts and hips, and the rosy and lively complexion, according to medical experts, are due to the sound function of the ovaries and vigorous metabolism. If a woman is unfortunate enough to suffer from irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge, inability to achieve orgasm, infertility, or other hidden diseases, the function of the ovaries will be destroyed, and the breasts will not develop well, or if they have already developed well, they will gradually atrophy. The same is true for the hips, and the metabolic rate is reduced. Therefore, the skin, muscles, blood, and other parts are filled with waste materials, and no new cells are produced, so the face becomes withered or pale. Although the age is still young, they are prematurely aging. Such women, in their virgin days, will not be able to choose a good man, and if they have married, the love between husband and wife will inevitably be weak, or even hopeless for childbearing, abandoned by their husbands, and feel that their life is drifting, how sad! The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Reproductive Element" for women to enhance the function of the ovaries and invigorate the metabolism. Not only can the above-mentioned symptoms be completely cured, but also the breasts can be raised, the hips can be developed, the face can be rosy, the muscles can be plump, and the blood can be full and bright red. It is truly the only scientific and good method to cure diseases, prolong life, and improve health and beauty.

Common Diseases of Youth
— Feng Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

### Masturbation and Nocturnal Emission are No Different from Cutting off One's Own Vitality

The most painful thing in life is like, "The falling flowers are sentimental, but the stream is merciless." We have come into contact with thousands of young patients, and we feel that they started with a wrong idea, ignorant of physiology, unaware of the preciousness of their own semen, indulging in masturbation, even cutting it off every day, until later, hundreds of morbid states appear, and the bad consequences have been formed, and when they are about to implement the most precious happiness life, they realize that "the arrow at the end of its flight, even if it penetrates the Lu silk." A steamed bun that has already reached the mouth can only be watched, without the strength to chew it, so they are as anxious as ants on a hot pot, crying and begging people for treatment. However, "holding the Buddha's feet at the last minute," the regret at this time is ultimately too late!

Therefore, the ancients have said, "Be cautious in all things before, and you will regret it later." We should use what we should use, and not use what we should not use in our lives. This is not only true for one thing and one object, but also for physiological needs. For example, married life is the great way of human relations, and it has the mission of procreating the race, improving society, and regulating the body and mind. We should naturally do it, but we must also know where to stop. Too much or too little is harmful. Masturbation is the devil of health and the executioner of happiness. We, the intelligent youth, must not let this kind of mechanical, anti-physiological act of lust touch our bodies, because once this demon touches our bodies, what follows is nocturnal emission. After too frequent nocturnal emission, backaches, sore backs, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, palpitations, dizziness, blurred vision, impotence, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, thin essence, dry essence, prolonged infertility, and other symptoms will inevitably follow one after another. Then your mind will be depressed! Your spirit will be decadent! Your body will be thin! You will be listless all day long, and your splendid future will turn into bubbles! Happiness between the sexes will disappear. Many promising people have been obscured by such encounters, and even resentfully committed suicide!

Don't wait until the day a tragedy befalls you, then you will only have the fate of "regretting it too late when things come to a head." You should now realize your mistake immediately. If you have committed masturbation, you should immediately raise your will, engage in beneficial exercise, and abstain from masturbation. Those who have symptoms such as nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea should especially rub the local area with cold water before going to bed, and take four "Heimitu's Essence-Solidifying Tablets," so that the sperm gate will be as solid as a golden soup, and your semen will not flow out. If you have already brewed various symptoms of weakness due to masturbation and nocturnal emission, you should also take "Reproductive Element," a reproductive gland preparation, at the same time. This agent has great medicinal power, and can produce essence and strengthen the kidneys, strengthen the brain and benefit the marrow within a day and night after taking it. If you can continue to take it and persevere, then even the most weakened body will not be difficult to restore to health in a short period of time.

White Turbidity Forum
— Written by Dai De, Gonorrhea Specialist

Clinic: Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road

Clinic Hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM

Free consultation, only 40 cents registration fee

### The Key to Easily Curing Gonorrhea

The condition of white turbid discharge is universally acknowledged as easily contagious and notoriously difficult to eradicate completely. The world knows this to be true but fails to understand the underlying reasons and appropriate treatments. Some rely on chance, while others depend on the heavily advertised medications for white turbid discharge. They often self-administer over-the-counter remedies readily available in the market, unaware that the disease of gonorrhea presents with complex and subtle conditions. It requires sincere learning, extensive experience, the application of scientific methods, and meticulous care. Patients must be aware and should never experiment with medications or treatments on themselves. Since gonorrhea is inherently intricate and delicate, readily available remedies from the market are unlikely to be precisely suitable. Success cannot be expected from those with superficial understanding or medical practitioners with outdated and inadequate facilities who rely on crude procedures and equipment. This is manifestly clear.

Firstly, patients must remember that the pain experienced during acute white turbid discharge is a natural physiological response. Forcibly suppressing it for temporary relief through common analgesic treatments only numbs the nerves and reduces the patient's resistance. Is this not akin to adding fuel to the fire or arming a thief? Therefore, those skilled in treating white turbid discharge prioritize rapid and legitimate eradication during the acute stage of gonorrhea to prevent future syphilis. Otherwise, once the acute phase passes, it becomes chronic, recurring intermittently, with complications such as arthritis, cystitis, orchitis, and prostatitis. Hence, patients should consult experienced physicians during the acute phase and receive rational treatments, such as painless injections using specially made autogenous vaccines, cooling methods, and German Filtr淋平 galvanic therapy. Only then can the gonococci be eliminated, and the patient's resistance increased, leading to a complete cure within one to two weeks, preventing the disease from progressing to the chronic stage. The key to fundamentally resolving white turbid discharge lies in "eliminating the bacteria." Such "bacteria elimination" requires the right methods and cannot be achieved by irresponsible individuals.

Specialty: Also treating syphilis, buboes, chancres, and painless new method of circumcision.

Traditional Chinese Medicine and Dietary Therapy

### Concurrent Treatment and Recuperation for Non-Critical Illnesses: Treating Hemoptysis

— Xie Yenong

After contracting an illness, besides seeking medical treatment, one must also implement appropriate recuperation and moderation in terms of daily life, diet, and mental state. This facilitates easier recovery for mild illnesses and reduces the risks of severe ones. Conversely, minor ailments may worsen, and serious conditions may become critical. This applies to all diseases, including hemoptysis. Patients with hemoptysis should consider the following points in addition to medication:

Psychological Recuperation: Upon experiencing hemoptysis, most people feel extreme panic, as if life is immediately threatened. Some mistakenly believe that hemoptysis is a sign of advanced pulmonary tuberculosis, marking the end of their life. This misconception is a major psychological error. It is essential to understand that this condition varies in severity and is not always critical. While hemoptysis can occur during the course of pulmonary tuberculosis, it is not exclusively indicative of it. Patients should avoid panic and anxiety and instead maintain a calm demeanor, firmly believing that medication will be effective and rest will promote recovery.

Prudent Actions: Whether hemoptysis originates from the lungs or the stomach, it is crucial to rest calmly, avoid strenuous activities, limit talking, and refrain from anger. Strenuous activities can damage blood vessels, making it difficult for wounds to heal. Excessive talking leads to excitement and tension in the blood vessels, hindering wound recovery. Anger can cause blood flow to become erratic, increasing blood loss.

Prohibited Items: Alcohol, tobacco, and tea have stimulating effects on the nervous system and should be avoided not only during hemoptysis but also even after initial recovery when blood vessel coagulation is not yet fully solidified. Consuming these stimulating substances can easily lead to recurrence. Additionally, spicy and hot foods such as chili peppers, ginger, red dates, and pepper should also be avoided.

Dietary Therapy: Lotus root is sweet and cooling, capable of cooling the blood and stopping bleeding, including hemoptysis and epistaxis. During significant hemoptysis, drinking freshly squeezed lotus root juice frequently is highly effective. Those with a history of bleeding disorders should consume it regularly. Cooked lotus root soup can harmonize the blood, calm the nerves, and benefit the stomach. Suzhou cooked lotus root also nourishes the lungs. Therefore, this food is an excellent therapeutic choice for hemoptysis. Baiji powder, Sanqi ginseng, and ink also treat hemoptysis because they contain high levels of gelatinous substances that can adhere to ruptured blood vessels, promoting coagulation. They are commonly used in medicine for this purpose.

### Hawthorn Syrup

— Chen Jiazhen

Careless eating habits or exposure to wind after meals can easily lead to food stagnation, causing digestive dysfunction, resulting in abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, and other symptoms. In such cases, promoting digestion is advisable. The simplest and most effective method is hawthorn syrup. It also stimulates saliva production upon consumption, similar to drinking coffee or tea. It is especially suitable for treating food stagnation in children, who are often reluctant to take medication. Offering them this syrup is sure to please them. The preparation method is detailed below: First, purchase four taels of charred hawthorn powder from a pharmacy, heat it in a pot, add four taels of brown sugar, and simmer in a pot until the sugar dissolves, then simmer for another five minutes before removing. Place in a bowl to form a syrup-like consistency. When using, mix two spoonfuls with boiling water. Hawthorn has a sour and sweet taste that helps increase stomach acid and promote digestion, which is unmatched by other medications. Regularly drinking a small amount of this syrup after meals can prevent various gastrointestinal diseases. Its sweet and delicious taste is similar to that of coffee.

### Overweight and Underweight

— Chen Zuolei

Being overweight or underweight is not inherently a disease; however, excessive obesity or emaciation is beyond the norm and will soon become a disease. In such cases, weight loss or weight gain is necessary. However, using medication is not advisable. The following are two simple dietary therapies:

Treating Obesity: Regularly drink kelp soup during meals to lose weight and treat obesity. Ancient herbal texts from the Dunhuang caves also record that "kelp lowers qi and prolonged consumption makes one thin." Kelp lowers blood pressure, making it suitable for obese people.

Treating Underweight: Mix bone marrow with Rehmannia juice, white honey, and black sesame seeds to form a powder, then cook into a liquid paste and consume as a snack daily. Although the taste may not be pleasant, it can gradually increase weight and nourish the five internal organs.

### The Affliction of Hemorrhoids

— Xu Jintao

According to statistics from medical practitioners, most hemorrhoid sufferers either reside in damp, low-lying areas, sit all day with little exercise, overwork themselves, or have a predisposition to damp heat, or are accustomed to excessive drinking without moderation, damaging their internal organs and leading to this disease.

Once hemorrhoids develop, bowel movements become uncomfortable and irregular, leading to mental fatigue and decreased work capacity, even causing severe pain and bed rest. The treatment method for painful bowel movements is to moisten dryness and dispel dampness; for anal prolapse pain, clear fire and dispel dampness; for difficulty urinating, clear the liver and guide dampness. For existing fistulas, focus on nourishing the primordial qi, replenishing yin, and cultivating essence. At the same time, special attention should be paid to diet. First, smoking and alcohol must be avoided. Additionally, spicy foods such as chili peppers, garlic, garlic sprouts, scallions, ginger, mud crabs, soft-shelled turtles, blood clams, fish, shrimp, melons, fruits, coffee, sorghum wine, and other irritating foods should no longer be consumed. Otherwise, the disease will worsen, causing increasing pain, financial burden, and harm to the body, leading to unimaginable consequences.

### Eggs and Soybean Milk

— Zhang Ruwei

Eggs provide the most abundant nutrition, while soybean milk is rich in fatty acids, which can moisturize the stomach and intestines. Every morning, whisk one raw egg into a cup of plain soybean milk and consume it as a snack. The benefits are superior to any tonic. According to a friend who suffered from lung disease, he contracted chronic pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of sixteen or seventeen. He experienced hemoptysis, coughing, fever, night sweats, and loss of voice, with critical symptoms occurring in succession. Medical treatment proved ineffective. Later, he tried this method. After one month, there was no change; after two months, the coughing subsided; after three months, his voice returned. After continuing for six months, all symptoms disappeared. After one year, he transformed into a strong young man. He continued to consume this remedy. Now over fifty years old, symptoms of hemoptysis and coughing have never recurred.

### Brief Notes on Dietary Therapy

Kumquats Compare to Oranges

Among fruits, people often prefer oranges because they are juicy and sweet. However, there is also a type called kumquat, also known as golden tangerine, or golden egg. It can relieve hangovers, promote digestion, resolve phlegm, and quench thirst. Although its flesh tastes slightly sour, it is beneficial and harmless to consume.
— (Zhang Chun)

Corn Stalks Substitute for Medicine

Take several corn stalks, scrape off the kernels, leaving only the stalks. Bake them on a tile until they turn to charcoal. Separately, bake some tea leaves until charred. Boil them together and drink the decoction to treat colds with headaches. Drink this decoction several times a day, preferably avoiding wind and resting quietly afterward for optimal effect.
— (Wei Siqi)

Homemade Fresh Liver Juice

Take five to six taels of fresh beef or pork liver, repeatedly wash it with boiling water, chop it up, and mix it with an appropriate amount of warm water. Then, strain it through gauze, and drink the juice at once (if you find the fishy smell unpleasant, you can add a little lemon juice or orange juice). It has special effects on neurasthenia and pernicious anemia.
— (Shen Cai Zhi)

Pig Brain Cures Dizziness

For dizziness not caused by external wind-cold but due to upward flare of deficient fire, use two or three pig brains, add scallions, ginger, cooking wine, salt, soy sauce, and other ingredients, steam or pan-fry, and eat. After several times, the condition should improve.
— (Zhang Zhongxian)

Wonderful Remedy for Seminal Emission

Take four qian of Job's tears, one liang each of Hunan lotus seeds and Gorgon fruit, one liang of Huai yam, two qian of jujube seeds, and four qian of Poria cocos (stir-fried). Add some water, put in a porcelain jar, and simmer over charcoal on low heat. Add a little white sugar daily and eat it to treat seminal emission, with miraculous results.
— (Li Chunyi)

Lily Bulb Generally Nourishing

Lily bulbs can calm the nerves and moisten the lungs. Eating more can boost energy, clear the mind. Eating a bowl a day is very nourishing, but the taste is slightly bitter. Add a little white sugar when cooking. It is best to eat this for convalescence after illness.
— (Zhang Lu)

Clams Soften the Liver and Replenish Blood

Tegillarca granosa, commonly known as clams. They are mostly cooked in boiling water, then mixed with ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil before eating. Ancient herbal texts state that this food softens the liver, nourishes the liver, replenishes blood, and strengthens the stomach. The taste is extremely delicious and is truly an unparalleled food for dietary therapy. The shell is also used in medicine, known as tile shavings. Ancient books state that it can treat chronic stomach pain, blood clots, and pain from blood stasis. Are these symptoms not similar to those of stomach cancer and stomach ulcers today? Li Shizhen said that this substance is salty, moves the blood, and softens hardness, so it has miraculous effects on both stomach cancer and stomach ulcers. Mr. Zhang mentioned it in previous issues, but the explanation was incomplete, so I am adding a few words to supplement it.

### Glutinous Rice Flour

— Zhang Huailin

Glutinous rice flour is used to make dumplings filled with sweet osmanthus and red bean paste or savory winter bamboo shoots and minced meat. They are fragrant, sweet, and delicious, enjoyed by many. However, they are difficult to digest for the elderly and children, often causing stagnation and digestive problems such as loss of appetite, constipation, fever, or dysentery. This phenomenon is very common after the New Year.

The difficulty in digesting glutinous rice dumplings lies in the glutinous rice flour itself. Glutinous rice is very sticky and dense. When ground into flour and mixed with water, it becomes even more sticky and can also ferment. People with weak digestive systems easily experience stagnation. After stagnation, the glutinous rice flour ferments in the stomach, causing stomach acid to overflow and producing a peculiar odor.

To treat indigestion caused by glutinous rice flour, pharmacies sell a product called "rice ash," which is rice that has been stir-fried into charcoal. Swallow two or three qian with boiling water. It can prevent fermentation and absorb moisture, so it is very effective.

### An Inexpensive Treatment: Ginger Stops Vomiting Miraculously

— Wu Shanqing

Vomiting can be caused by either cold or heat. For heat-related vomiting, bitter and cold medications are needed to promote downward movement of the reverse qi. However, the medicinal properties are difficult to accept without supplementing it with the pungent and warm flavor of ginger. For cold-related vomiting, it is often due to weakness of the spleen and stomach, with cold arising from within, leading to frequent vomiting and inability to eat or drink. It is especially beneficial to eat ginger, which can unblock yang, discharge turbidity, dispel cold, and eliminate filth, often with immediate effect.

Ginger contains volatile oils that stimulate the stomach nerves, increasing stomach secretions and promoting peristalsis. It also stimulates the small intestine and enhances the absorption of the intestinal lacteals, making it a good product for stopping vomiting and strengthening the stomach.

Ginger juice can treat vomiting, as mentioned above. To use it, grind fresh ginger to extract two spoonfuls of natural juice, mix with half a small cup of warm water, and sip frequently in small amounts. Anyone suffering from vomiting that refuses food will often stop vomiting with each sip.

### Dietary Therapy for Critical Illnesses

— Lu Chengyi

There is a common misconception that dietary therapy is only suitable for minor ailments, such as hemorrhoids and scabies. For diseases that are deep-seated and beyond the reach of medicine, what use are ordinary foods? In fact, when a disease is critical, the stomach is bound to be weak. Most medicines can harm the stomach. Therefore, those who are very ill may vomit and cannot accept medicine. In critical situations, what use is medicine? At this time, slowly regulate the body with foods that please the stomach and are suitable for the condition. The illness will naturally turn for the better. Both medicine and food enter the stomach first, and then all other functions begin.

### Oranges

— Sun Zonglu

Oranges are a superior fruit. The honey oranges produced in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province, are the best in our country, sweet as honey and leaving a fragrant taste in the mouth. Comparing American Florida oranges with honey oranges, one tastes sour and bitter, while the other is as sweet as candy. The difference is clear. Oranges are rich in nutrients and are essential for human nutrition. Peeling and eating an orange after a meal can nourish the body and aid digestion, making it a natural and wonderful product. Also, for those suffering from typhoid fever and other febrile infectious diseases, making juice from several oranges a day can reduce fever and inflammation. It is also a specific medicine for treating scurvy. Eating it can alleviate the disease, and its effect is unmatched by any medicine.

A friend of mine was physically weak, with swollen gums that bled frequently. Later, he drank orange juice every day, and in a few days, his gum swelling subsided, and the bleeding stopped. This disease was caused by a lack of nutrients, which oranges contain in abundance. Therefore, after my friend drank orange juice, his disease was completely cured, which is not surprising.

### Silkie Chicken

— Jiang Jianchu

Chicken can replenish vitality and qi, nourish yin and kidneys, so it is always regarded as a valuable household food. Among chickens, the black-boned chicken is even more valuable.

The black-boned chicken, also known as silkie chicken, is easy to identify. Its foot skin is black or bluish-gray, and its comb is often purple. Its feathers are mostly white, and black ones are even better. It has a sweet taste and warm nature, can replenish yin deficiency, and treat diabetes. For women, it can regulate menstruation and promote conception, stop leukorrhea and unblock menstruation: the market also sells White Phoenix Pills made from black-boned chicken. For adults and children, it can treat dysentery and replenish vitality. Its gizzard, liver, and yellow skin can treat premature ejaculation in young men, bed-wetting in children, and intestinal wind disorders, with unexpected effects. Regular consumption can nourish qi and replenish blood, and regulate various ailments. However, you should choose the male chicken when purchasing, and the blacker the bone, the better.

### Wonderful Product for Treating Swelling

— Zhang Zhongxian

There are many causes of edema, but to summarize, it is nothing more than the disease lying in the spleen and kidneys. But if the edema does not cause umbilical protrusion, back flattening, supraclavicular fossa flattening, sole flattening, lips swollen and black, or scrotum and penis swelling and rot, it is still treatable. In addition to medicine, winter melon and blackfish are most effective for treatment. After washing the winter melon, cut it into slices with the skin, and add dried mussels to cook a soup. If there is no winter melon, use blackfish (also known as black carp or seven-star fish), remove the scales and internal organs, wash it clean, and add garlic to cook a soup. Dried mussels nourish yin and replenish the kidneys. When the kidney qi is sufficient, the spleen will also be healthy and functioning, and water will flow freely. Winter melon promotes urination and leads water downwards. Long-term consumption will naturally show effects. Blackfish supports the spleen and promotes urination. Garlic strengthens the spleen and stomach, treats kidney qi, and opens orifices to promote urination. When the two are combined, they treat both the spleen and kidneys. However, neither should add oil or salt, as adding oil or salt will negate their diuretic effect, and there will be no effect.

### Money

— Ren Yong

The Bible says: "The love of money is the root of all evil." Although this sentence emphasizes the word "love," which implies insatiable greed, the lines also suggest that "money" is contemptible. As the root of evil, "money" seems to bear some responsibility.

Disdain for wealth has always been a common characteristic of self-proclaimed noble literary scholars, both in China and abroad, ancient and modern. Ancient Chinese people were ashamed to talk about "money," calling it "A Du's object," thinking there could be no greater nobility.

But in reality? What crime has "money" committed to be so despised? Frankly, who in this world can escape it? Even in the future, no matter how developed and sound the credit system becomes, money will still exist abstractly. Why should we regard disdain for wealth as nobility? We live in a utilitarian world; rights and obligations must be clearly distinguished. Zheng Banqiao once said well behind his painting fees: "It is always better to send silver than gifts or food; what the public sends may not be what the brother likes. Sending cash brings joy to the heart, and the paintings are all good. Gifts are sources of dispute, and debts are often unpaid. Old and tired, I will not waste time making useless conversation with gentlemen." This direct, straightforward, and candid tone is what makes Banqiao superior.

So money should not be despised, nor does it need to be despised, because "money itself is innocent." It depends on the person.

Traitors hoard wealth to provide for their children, grandchildren, and concubines to squander. In this case, money is indeed too despicable. But we have also seen people pull out their gold teeth to donate to the government; accumulate a day's worth of shoe-shining money to donate to the government; countless anonymous Mr. So-and-Sos are generously providing relief to refugees in the newspapers. In this case, money seems to be worthy of praise. The same Central Bank note can be either fragrant or foul, with endless variations. But we must recognize that it is passive. The key lies entirely with the person.

So I want to speak up for money. People should not manipulate money themselves and then blame it for the evil. From now on, our view of money must change: money itself is pure, but people have dyed it with various colors and added fragrances and foul juices. We don't need to scold money as A Du's object. On the contrary, we should control ourselves, not earn money from shamelessness, and not waste money on meaninglessness. We should exchange our conscience and sweat for money and use it for valuable purposes. Then money becomes supremely noble and worthy of praise.

### On "Friends' Day"

— Xueliang

The proverb says, "All within the four seas are brothers." Another proverb says, "Rely on your parents at home, rely on your friends when you're away from home." It is evident that friends are indeed necessary for us humans. For this reason, Mr. Huang Jingwan initiated the designation of March 3rd of each year as China's Friends' Day, to unite individuals, in the purpose of personality equality, to do more beneficial business, and to seek human happiness. Time flies so fast, it is already the sixth Friends' Day since the inception; Like Women's Day, Children's Day, etc., Friends' Day is also the most celebrated and commemorated, especially in the warm and sunny spring, and friendly time.

As proven by the facts, Friends' Day is indeed worthy of promotion and expansion; especially in the current time of grave national crisis, it needs to be promoted to make every stranger, every person without emotion, become warm, thereby firmly uniting to create a solid collective, which is helpful and beneficial to the ongoing war of resistance.

The brutal invaders have trampled on our countless fine lands; they killed our countless beloved and kind compatriots; when Friends' Day comes, thinking of this scene, sadness inevitably arises in our hearts. They are also "people," we are also "people," why do they have to encounter such hardship? Why can we only safely enjoy ourselves on an isolated island? The purpose of Friends' Day is to call on us to bear some basic responsibility, not just chant high-sounding words and slogans, and call it over. Although we cannot shoulder guns and go to the front line to kill the enemy happily, we must, after all, do some charity work, promote savings for disaster relief, and try to use domestic goods... Is this not a way to love the country and save the country?

Friends with money should know the plight of those poor and unfortunate friends around you, and try to help them as much as possible, whether material or spiritual, everything is needed. Poor friends in difficult circumstances should not be disappointed and decadent, sigh in despair, and adopt a negative attitude; we must know that everything depends on human effort. As long as we all cheer up, encourage each other, work hard, and strive, nothing will not be successful!

The past Friends' Days do not seem to have been satisfactory in this regard; however, starting from this year's Friends' Day, I believe that there will be great achievements. All friends, including all old, young, male, female, rich, poor, knowledgeable, and illiterate, let's all cheer up, let's all unite, and under the great purpose of personality equality, saving for disaster relief, loving the country and saving the country, everyone is preparing for new efforts and new forces to create the glorious history of future China.

On this year's Friends' Day, we cannot and cannot bear to celebrate wildly, but we hope that when next year's Friends' Day comes, everyone, every compatriot, that is, every friend, will be able to celebrate and commemorate as much as possible.

### Continued Discussion on Cigarette Cards

— Li Xiaoyong

When it came to China's Nanyang region, cigarette companies like Hua Cheng rose up, and the market share of various foreign cigarette companies was largely taken over, recovering quite a few rights and interests. Nanyang Hua Cheng mainly produced landscapes and embroidered portraits (i.e., Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Investiture of the Gods, etc.), Hardman specialized in drama, Hua Cheng specialized in fashionable beauties, and the cards produced by other cigarette merchants were all crudely made and mostly of low-grade taste. During this period, most cigarette cards were of no value.

Later, Red Tin Package cigarettes came out with a series of famous women of past dynasties (such as Yang Guifei, Cao Dajia, Hongyan, etc.) with brief biographies on the back. Following this, Hua Cheng's Golden Mouse brand produced characters from "Dream of the Red Chamber," with gold trim and poetic commentary on the back. After that, they also produced Beijing Opera Ugly Figure Cartoons, etc. Nanyang Da Lian Zhu included new costumes, and the "Shuobu" series included "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Seven Heroes and Thirteen Gallants," as well as brief biographies of famous generals of past dynasties (with extremely concise biographies on the back). Zijinshan brand produced Three Kingdoms characters, with gold trim and poetic commentary on the back. Sitaphay brand produced Red Border Seven Swords and Thirteen Gallants, etc. During this period, the cigarette cards produced by various cigarette merchants mostly drew from "Shuobu," and the colored cards with explanations on the back of the "Nanyang Water Margin" were extremely beautifully drawn. Each batch of new cards that came out was eagerly bought by collectors from card dealers, sparing no expense to get them first. Unfortunately, after more than forty episodes, totaling about three hundred cards, the artist changed, and the printing quality also declined. The Nanyang-produced series of famous generals of past dynasties was always considered the most suitable for educating the public, promoting national glory, and inspiring the spirit of the people. In short, during this period, the cigarette cards produced by Nanyang Company held a leading position.

After the January 28th Incident, the number of cigarette factories in China increased, and cigarette cards also came in various styles. Fuxin Company's Pyramid cigarettes came out with a series of realistic pictures of the Battle of Shanghai, which was most welcomed by all walks of life. This shows a glimpse of the psychology of the masses in China at that time.

Recently, some people have advocated using cigarette cards to popularize folk education, which is indeed a matter worthy of attention. Many foreign tobacco companies produce a kind of practical small craft picture cards to educate people about production, which is a very good intention. There are also many companies that produce a kind of picture cards specifically introducing emerging theories, which shows the importance that foreign people attach to cigarette cards now. During this long period of China's war of resistance, how should cigarette merchants use picture cards to help the country promote justice, so that they can look at foreign cigarette merchants without shame? Now that Shanghai cannot depict the heroic resistance of the soldiers at the front line on picture cards, at least it must achieve the degree of educating the public. (The End)

### Nine Twists of a Tender Heart

— Ru Hua

“The Young in Heart”

After watching "Nine Twists of a Tender Heart," I felt that this story was too sad! A woman named Ellen Fortune, who had an old friend leave her a lot of money and a residence in London, and who could travel around to dispel the sadness of her later years, how much she longed for the vitality of youth! This kind of sadness stored in her heart, by chance, she met Anthony's family. When Leacher and Zhu Zhi'anni's youthful vitality appeared in front of her, painful memories made her inexplicably feel good about Anthony's family. She wanted to find the shadows of Dick (her old friend) and herself in these young people. "The Young in Heart" unfolds such a sad story.

Probably due to the decision of the script content, the director's handling of this story adopted an unusually slow tone; and the whole film from beginning to end describes the trivial daily life of Anthony's family, so orderly, like a sailboat sailing on a calm sea, steadily reaching its destination. This sketching style does have its special achievements, but it also immerses the audience under the screen in painful memories. Then, the vitality of youth encouraged by "Nine Twists of a Tender Heart" may also have the opposite effect: at least that's what I personally think.

The director's quiet and humorous style naturally has his artistic achievements. For example: he introduced the four characters of Anthony's family at the beginning, and he clearly portrayed the four outlines ideal in the playwright's mind, and all the way to the end, he always firmly grasped their personalities. What's more, in every detail, he made them active on the screen very humorously and satirically. For example: After Anthony's family was driven out, they huddled on the street, Mr. and Mrs. Anthony sang, Leacher and Zhu Zhi lay on the street cleaner's cart, after arriving in London, the father and son looked at the crane, Anthony was a car salesman: Leacher's drunkenness, etc., all fully showed the vivid image of these four characters.

In terms of actors: Lauren Yang's father, Pipa Burke's mother, Little Fan Bank's brother, Jenny Gaynor's sister, and Mary Turley's Ellen Fortune all played their acting skills separately.

### After the Rain Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 5 Spring Arrives at Bilo Fragrance Floating on Snowy Sea, Flowers Fly at Tiger Hill, Moon Full at Li Lake

Now, on Mount Lengjia, a very good Chinese-style house has been built, and that house is called the Stone Lake Academy. The name of this academy has a long history in China. There were academies in the Song Dynasty. The academy was also like today's universities and middle schools, and there were also scholars studying there. The person in charge of the academy was formerly called Shanzhang, who was hired by the local government to be a local Confucian scholar. Suzhou originally had several academies, and every month they would issue questions for the old test, and those with excellent writing would also be awarded a stipend. Since the schools were established, the academies were abolished, but why is there a Stone Lake Academy now? Isn't this restoring the old and reversing the car? No! To say that the term academy is ancient, then the term school is even more ancient. In fact, this academy is somewhat different from the past. It is not a place for scholars to study, but a place for a group of old and learned scholars to study and write. There are classicists, historians, textual critics, lyricists, and poets, and painters in it. In short, China's inherent old learning is gathered in it. Although the people inside are not limited to Suzhou people, Suzhou people account for the majority. Because Wu Zhong is prosperous in literature and history, and has been praised since the dynasties, and Suzhou has always been home to a large number of leisurely people, commonly known as "xieyi friends." Xieyi friends are best at studying this kind of learning. Don't underestimate that Stone Lake Academy, at least fifty or sixty kinds of works are published by the Stone Lake Academy every year! These books are published by a Shanghai library, which has a special agreement. The authors receive royalties, but this royalty is jointly owned by the academy. Because those old gentlemen are paid a monthly salary by the academy, which is very generous, and they are mostly over fifty or sixty years old, and they are indifferent and quiet, they don't want to greedy for any extra profits, and they don't need them to support their families, so they are willing to give the royalties to the public. At first, the number of books published was small, and the annual income was not much. Later, the number of books published increased, and this royalty was really considerable. They jointly discussed taking a sum of money from this royalty to collect ancient prints and reward woodcuts, etc., which is 10,000 yuan per year. Other expenses of the Stone Lake Academy are covered by other funds, and there is no need for it to seek elsewhere. The obscene temple, where cow ghosts and snake gods and female witches used to be superstitious and worshipped, has now become a place where those old gentlemen with gray hair and eyebrows study, develop, write books and establish theories. It is really a world of difference. Only Wu Sujun has been to this Stone Lake Academy. She said: She has an uncle who is also a textual critic and lives in the academy. She has visited him several times. (50)

### On Laughter in Kun Opera (Part 2)

— Yan Hongxiang Yuanzhu

The length ratio of each note of the Dan's laughter is opposite to that of the Sheng, with a ratio of one to two to three, and the size ratio is also the same. As for the reason for the opposite, the laughter of men is unrestrained, erupting suddenly, so it goes from large to small; the laughter of women is due to the psychology of shame, not daring to laugh openly, enduring it again and again until it is unbearable, so it is like a water break that collapses the embankment, so in the past it was from small to large. "Dream of the Red Chamber" writes the laughter of women as "bubbler," which is quite wonderful, and can also prove that it starts from small to large.

The Jing's laughter is mostly "yixixi, yixi, yixi, yixi hahaha," and its length and cadence can now be expressed in Western musical notation as follows: (using two-four time)

yixixi | yixi— | xixi hahaha | ha. ||

Angry laughter is mostly performed by the Sheng, and its sound is as follows:

Aha ah, ha— | hehehe | he. ||

The clown's cheerful laughter with humor is shown as follows:

Ai, yo— | hahaha | ha.

The word "ai" is pronounced like the word "ai," and it must be light and fast. The word "yo" is pronounced in the lower level tone, and it must be raised, emphasized, and lengthened. The word "ha" is like the laughter of the Sheng. If you don't believe it, try to learn it according to this, and you will have a wonderful understanding.

The Dan's laughter should always be light and easy, and the Tie should be charming and clever. As for the laughter of sickness and madness, it may be slightly heavier.

(3) Gestures: The Sheng's laughter, either with both hands flipping and crossing each other in a very happy state, or slightly raising one arm and waving its sleeves with the sound of laughter, mostly opening its mouth. As for angry laughter, it often strokes its beard with one hand and points its finger with the other, glaring and gnashing its teeth, pointing and laughing.

The Dan and Tie's laughter, either with hands crossed, or clapping hands, or not using hands to express it, but mostly covering the mouth with a kerchief is the key element, see "Nao Xue," "Jia Qi," "Ji Jian," "Shuo Qin," "Hui Hua," and other dramas.

The Jing's laughter, either with hands open as if embracing something in the air, chest out, head slightly raised, and then shaking the body with the sound of laughter, such as in "Shan Men," or holding the beard with both hands, looking left and right, and shaking the face upwards, such as in "Hua Dang," "Gong Yan," "Bei Zha," and other dramas.

The Wai and Mo's laughter is like the Sheng's. If wearing a sable and gauze hat, the hat wings must be shaken, but not too much, and especially avoid vulgarity. The clown's laughter often has no special gestures. The square scarf is sometimes flipped and crossed with both hands (faster than the Sheng's laughter), then nodding, and moving the chest. Making these two gestures will fully describe its frivolous, dry, and crazy air.

Pretended laughter, regardless of Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, or Chou, is the same as cheerful laughter and smiling laughter. The point that allows the audience to distinguish it is another special expression. This special expression, either with sleeves blocking the face, or hitting the back bow, or making an angry appearance, or a funny appearance. Sheng, such as in "Lian Huan Ji's" small banquet, Dan, such as in "Ci Hu," Chou, such as in "Tou Ji," The Jing of Ge Zhao, then does not block sleeves, does not hit the back bow, only straightens the crown, fastens the belt, and strokes the beard, making a majestic appearance, which is also a special case of pretended laughter.

### Regarding Norma Shearer, She is Truly an Excellent and Progressive Star and a Model for Chinese Actresses

— Xin Liang

Norma Shearer is undoubtedly the greatest and most successful actress in Hollywood today. Her superb acting skills in "Their Own Desire," "Smilin' Through," and "Marie Antoinette," who wouldn't envy her, praise her, and admire her? In recent days, Reuters' Hollywood telegram said that she was seriously ill, and every movie fan who cares about ladies couldn't help but feel a little uneasy. Now, let me write down the history of the lady's lifelong struggle and dedicate it to you readers.

Serious Life

Ms. Norma was born in Montreal, Canada on August 10, 1904. She is almost thirty-five years old. She does not follow the customs of ordinary actresses, and does not have love affairs all day and night: her life is always serious, excellent, and quiet. She is a virtuous wife, a good mother, and also an excellent actor: the reason why she has achieved today's success is precisely because of this quiet and clear life.

The Idea of Drama

As early as her childhood, Ms. Norma liked the things on the stage. She began to hope that she would become a big star in the future, and dreamed that one day she would achieve great success. When she was sixteen or seventeen years old, her thoughts were focused on the news of drama. As long as she saw that a theater was putting on a play, she would definitely take some free time out of her busy schedule to rush to see it to her heart's content. At this time, the things she was most happy to read were good scripts, drama reviews, and other books.

The Golden Age

Norma Shearer also believes that a female child must have a beautiful face, good performing talent, and sufficient knowledge to be considered outstanding: therefore, she also pays attention to her business. Later fame, more than half may also rely on this belief. Mary Pickford began to show herself on the screen at the age of fifteen—the period of fifteen or sixteen years old is the most beautiful golden period for every woman! Norma Shearer also wanted to succeed in a career like Mary in this period, and be welcomed and loved by the public.

Determined Struggle

These hopes, these dreams, finally made her leave that quiet and simple Montreal City and come to the luxurious and prosperous New York City; wanting to realize her ideals in this metropolis of the times. However, at this time, she seemed to have not yet met "Lucky Star." She only worked in a public library, and the travel expenses she brought with her were almost used up, and her dear mother left her and returned…… But, what she had was only a determined will. Indeed, after a lot of twists and turns and tribulations, she finally had the opportunity to enter the photography studio and step into the door of the film industry that she had always dreamed of. Since then, she has been willing to work hard and constantly strive for success, and her success has established a solid foundation among the broad audience.

Norma Shearer is indeed a great red star. As long as we look at her past history of struggle and the high position she now stands in, we can easily know. Finally, let us hope that her throat disease can be cured soon, and do not let the disease demon entangle her.

### Shanghai Opera Must Be Improved

— Shao Huaizong

Shanghai opera has a large audience because its lyrics are popular and can match the psychology of the general public in society. If you are wandering on the road, the clear and pleasant Shanghai opera lyrics broadcast from the store's wireless electricity are enough to make you linger and forget to return: in the Shanghai opera venues in the amusement park, there are always crowds of people, and there is no space to sit. It can be seen that Shanghai opera is welcomed by the public.

Since Shanghai opera is so welcomed by the public, then how should Shanghai opera artists know how to encourage themselves and work hard to improve, so as not to fail the expectations of the social masses, and to fulfill their responsibilities as a member of the nation in this extraordinary period. But what makes people feel extremely sad is the inferiority of its scripts. What we hear every day are always some private agreements between men and women, flirtatious jokes, and the despicable and corrupt tunes such as hooking up and being adulterous. Performances of scripts that praise loyalty and contain national defense significance are as rare as phoenix feathers.

The performance of despicable and vulgar operas has a profound impact on the corruption of social atmosphere. Unknowingly, the spirit of the masses is declining day by day: who still thinks of the motherland in the current moment of life and death, who still thinks of the importance of the responsibility of a member of the nation? Undoubtedly, this will directly poison the public and indirectly hinder the national policy of long-term resistance. How can wise Shanghai opera artists bear it in their hearts?

Now is the great era of the Chinese nation's life and death resistance, and every Chinese is a member of the warrior. If anyone's behavior is contrary to the resistance, they will inevitably be criticized and abandoned by the masses: In the past, wasn't the Shanghai film industry reprimanded by a group of writers for producing bizarre monster movies? The overturned cart in front is a warning to the cart behind: I hope that Shanghai opera practitioners will repent. From now on, perform more scripts that are beneficial to the world and people's hearts and contain national defense significance. This is a great fortune for the public, and also a great fortune for the country!

You Can't Eat Theatre Food Without Becoming an Apprentice

The following year, I went to Beiping again, and the company was willing to pay 150 yuan to invite Wang to re-record. When I met Wang, I asked him impolitely: "Since you have such abilities, and you are also suffering from economic difficulties, then why don't you officially go to sea to eat theatre food?" He was very emotional when he heard my words, and said: "How easy is this matter to talk about? Insiders squeezing out outsiders is too fierce. But to be honest, it's also my own fault. I shouldn't have relied on my talent and pride to write new lyrics and completely overwhelmed their insider clowns, so I ended up being unable to get started. I will never be able to eat theatre food." At that time, I was very surprised when I heard it, so I asked him what was going on? So he told me the whole story: "On the Double Ten Festival of the Republic of China in 1925, Lu Zhang (Zongchang) invited all the Ping Jiao to Jinan to sing to celebrate the National Day. At that time, Yang Xiaolou, Yu Shuyan, Mei Lanfang, Wang Fengqing, Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Shang Xiaoyun, Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, Li Wanchun, Wang Changlin, Qian Jinfu, etc., all the famous actors in Beiping, all went to Jinan, Shandong, and the Railway Hotel was completely chartered as a place for the opera troupe to stay. It can be said to be an unprecedented grand event. Since the Republic of China, it has been a very rare grand gathering. Because I had a few rich friends in the military and political circles, they also let me string a play called "Huazi Picking Gold." When I didn't go on stage, I first compiled a large section of "Dry Board" (Dry Board means that the clown reads without the accompaniment of the erhu, only with the board), praising the achievements of Grand Marshal Zhang (Zuolin) and Lu Zhang Zhuzhu (Yupu). This section is as many as several hundred sentences, not only rhyming, but also there are several sentences that make them happy. At that time, Zhang Hanqing was sitting high on the large sofa chair at the mouth of the stage, accompanied by Zhang Zhu on the left and right. They could hear every word in their ears. Their subordinates, (from brigade commander to military commander, because the governor's office has limited space, so all are senior generals, and their families and guards, etc.) heard me praising their old marshal and Zhang Changtui, and they all applauded and welcomed them. Even these three generals were so happy that they leaned forward and backward and clapped their hands vigorously. As soon as the play was finished, 500 yuan of reward was immediately issued, saying that Governor Zhang was happy and rewarded. In this way, Wang Changlin, Ma Fulu, Ci Ruiquan, Xiao Changhua, Cao Ergeng Ru Fuhui and other clowns in the backstage were all driven crazy. "
