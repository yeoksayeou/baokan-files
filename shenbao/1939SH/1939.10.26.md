Gaoan: It is reported that the Japanese troops, who were driven back by the Chinese army near Fengxin, buried over five hundred bodies in the Shangning area. Among them were several officers, including Japanese infantry captain Horiguchi Takeshi and transport corps lieutenant Hirohira Toshio. Additionally, there were over one thousand two hundred and thirty unburied Japanese corpses, along with the bodies of Chinese men, women, and residents who were brutally murdered. The magnitude of Japanese casualties and the brutality towards the Chinese populace can be seen from this. (25th dispatch)

Sihui: Chinese troops have been attacking the Japanese on two routes, from Xinkai and Xinhe, for days, achieving numerous victories. On the evening of the 19th, the Xinkai route captured Jitang, killing over two hundred Japanese. On the Xinhe route, they charged into the Japanese positions several times, killing many more in hand-to-hand combat.

Chongqing: According to a spokesman for the Chinese army, as of mid-October, a total of 40,000 Japanese troops had arrived in Wuhan and were dispatched to the front lines in Hunan for rotation. On the 20th of this month, another 20,000 Japanese reinforcements arrived. Chinese military personnel anticipate that once the current continuous rain stops, the Japanese will begin a long-planned general offensive, advancing from east to west along the two Xiang-Gan highways, attempting to invade Changsha again. The Chinese army has strengthened its defenses in the area expected to become a war zone, preparing to offer strong resistance if the Japanese attack Changsha. (25th, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

Chongqing: According to a military spokesman, the battles in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in the past week have been most intense around Fengxin and Gaoan. After the Chinese army recaptured the strategic stronghold of Xiushui, they launched fierce attacks on the Japanese troops in Fengxin and Wu'ning. Through several nights of bloody fighting, the Chinese army has made significant progress on both fronts. On the Dongxin front, after capturing Maxingshan and Baimaogang, the Chinese army launched a fierce assault on Fengxin city. On the Wu'ning front, after capturing Putian Bridge, the vanguard of the Chinese army has approached the outskirts of Wu'ning city. Therefore, the Japanese troops in Fengxin and Wu'ning are now in a state of decline. In order to relieve the siege of Fengxin, the Japanese dispatched troops from Nanchang to launch fierce attacks on the Chinese in the Ji'an area. The brave soldiers in that area fought valiantly and repelled the Japanese. The defeated Japanese troops are in disarray, and the Chinese army is pursuing them closely. (24th dispatch)

### Reasons for the Japanese Failure to Invade Changsha

Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesman today, there are many reasons for the failure of the Japanese invasion of Changsha, but insufficient preparation was one of them. The Japanese originally planned to mobilize heavy troops from the Japanese mainland and "Manchukuo" before launching an attack on Changsha. However, the Japanese troops in northern Hunan advanced lightly towards Changsha before the reinforcements were concentrated, resulting in failure. According to the Chinese spokesman, 40,000 troops mobilized by the Japanese from "Manchukuo" and the Japanese mainland arrived in Hankou between October 1st and October 15th, and another 20,000 arrived in Hankou between October 19th and 20th. These 60,000 troops were originally intended to assist the Japanese troops in northern Hunan in attacking Changsha, but their arrival was too late, rendering them ineffective. (25th dispatch)

General Bai Chongxi Speaks

### China Can Continue the War of Resistance Even Without Much Foreign Aid; The U.S. Should Prohibit Supplying Japan with Military Raw Materials; If Japan Gains Power in China, All Countries Will Lose Their Interests; Hopes That the French Will Not Hinder Transportation in Southern China

Nanyue: According to General Bai Chongxi's remarks yesterday to an Associated Press reporter, the only way for the U.S. to protect its interests in the Far East is to prohibit the supply of military raw materials to Japan. "The American people should not only focus on the present but must look to the distant future. They should not only talk about the Open Door Policy in the Nine-Power Treaty but must further suspend the sale of military raw materials to Japan." If the U.S. can implement this consistent policy, it will not only greatly assist China but also maintain American interests in the Far East. "Of course, China can continue the war of resistance even without much foreign aid, but it will be difficult to prevent Japan from endangering American interests. This is a feeling shared by Britain and France, as they have also suffered greatly at the hands of the Japanese. Therefore, the U.S., Britain, and France should cooperate in the Far East." The General cited the seven European wars as examples, saying that the U.S. participation in the last war was "to uphold justice, thus shortening the war. This was a far-sighted action by the U.S." "Currently, U.S. President Roosevelt is like Wilson, standing up for justice. However, although there are many far-sighted Americans, a few isolated factions are often short-sighted and unable to recognize the truth of the world. They prioritize the interests of arms dealers over noble principles, so when a bill to prohibit the sale of arms to aggressor nations is about to pass, they try to obstruct it in every way. This attitude sacrifices the principle of security on which trade depends. What more can be said about their shortsightedness? If security is lost in the Far East due to such attitudes, then once Japan gains power in China, the interests of all countries will inevitably be lost." General Bai also expressed "extreme dissatisfaction" with the actions of the French authorities in Annam to restrict Chinese imports (such as gasoline and steel). "Frankly speaking, we are extremely dissatisfied with this restriction implemented by the French after the outbreak of the European war. We have protested to the French, and sometimes the French have slightly relaxed this restriction, but to this day, the French authorities in Annam are again implementing restrictions. The purpose of the current restrictions is incomprehensible. At the very least, the actions of the French are akin to helping Japan." According to General Bai, the actions of the French are due to fear of Japan. "But it must be known that what Japan wants is not only the interests of China but also the interests of France, Britain, and the U.S. in the Far East. If China cannot defend its interests, then it will certainly be unable to protect the interests of third countries in the Far East. Conversely, if China can maintain its interests against Japan, then the interests of third countries will also be safe, because our interests are largely harmonious and consistent with the interests of third countries. Now that the European war has broken out, we no longer expect France to provide any assistance to China. All we expect is that the French will "keep the transportation lines in southern China open" and not hinder them." General Bai declined to express his views on the European war but said, "We stand on the side of our friendly countries." When asked whether Britain and France would exert pressure on Japan after their victory, General Bai replied, "If I were in the same situation, I would do the same." According to General Bai, it will take no less than two months for the Japanese army to recover after its defeat in northern Hunan. Therefore, the new offensive will be two months later. The Chinese strategy has not changed at present, but the Chinese are prepared for a large-scale counteroffensive. However, this counteroffensive will depend on the following three factors: China's army training and equipment, the morale of the Japanese army and political changes in Tokyo, and changes in the international situation.

Zhu Jiahua Speaks to Reuters Reporter

### The Japanese Army, Having Failed in Its Invasion of Northern Hunan, Spreads Various Rumors in an Attempt to Cover Up the Truth of Its Military Failure and Fulfill Its Conspiracy of Discord

Chongqing: Zhu Jiahua, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, met with a Reuters reporter on the evening of the 24th. In response to inquiries about various rumors circulating recently, he replied, "I once told a reporter from the New York Times that the enemy country's dispatch of Shigenori Nishio to China was nothing more than a last-ditch effort." Indeed, the enemy army launched a large-scale offensive in Hunan, heading straight for Changsha, but unexpectedly, it was met with a head-on blow from our army and suffered a defeat. They then resorted to their old trick of fabricating various rumors, hoping to cover up the truth of their military failure and fulfill their conspiracy of discord. These rumors are not worth a smile from knowledgeable people and are not worth refuting. I will give a few examples. For example, the enemy spread the rumor that "Britain is advising China to make peace with Japan," and that "the Soviet Union is making coercive demands on the National Government." Not only are these rumors completely unfounded, but they are also contemptible propaganda that lacks all common sense. Since the War of Resistance, China has adhered to its established national policy, acting decisively and striving with all its might. Whether in internal affairs, diplomacy, military affairs, or construction, although there are myriad details, they all lead to the same goal. What is this goal? It is to target Japanese aggression, to shatter its dream of conquest, to restore the integrity of our territory and sovereignty, and to preserve our independence and freedom. As for peace, the enemy country is mired in an inextricable quagmire and desperately hopes for a "quick peace and quick decision." As for China, unless the Japanese warlords thoroughly repent and completely withdraw all their troops from our territory, there is no room for consideration. Such a firm stance cannot be changed by any environment, nor can it be swayed by any intention. Our Central Government has repeatedly declared this to the world. Moreover, the mission that China is currently undertaking in its heroic struggle is to fight for the maintenance of human justice. Countries with superior culture and a sense of justice will naturally continue to sympathize with and assist us, and this will last for a long time. As for the mutual cooperation between the Soviet Union and us, it has remained unwavering from beginning to end. The Soviet Ambassador to China, Pan Youxin, made this clear in his congratulatory remarks when presenting his credentials. Where does the so-called "coercive demands" come from? Since the viewpoints are consistent and the interests are the same, it is inevitable in terms of both principle and reason. In summary, the relationship between China and Britain and China and the Soviet Union is exceptionally close. We only see the friendship between each other increasing day by day. This ironclad fact lies before our eyes, and there is no need to say more. Therefore, if similar rumors occur in the future, they will be nothing more than a desperate and absurd expression of the enemy, and they will be completely unfounded. Zhu also mentioned the Chongqing news published in the English version of the Shanghai Great American Evening Post on the 21st regarding Japan's three proposed ceasefire conditions to China, saying that he did not know where the Great American Evening Post obtained this news. The publication of such a nonsensical rumor by the newspaper is enough to make its credibility and value plummet. Finally, the reporter asked Zhu for his views on the European situation. Zhu said, "The outbreak of the European war is truly a great misfortune for mankind, but I hope that a reasonable solution can be found so that Europe can regain its light." (25th dispatch)

Resolution: Passed. The measures are as follows: (A) Local governments and their service agencies should give special protection and assistance to the families of those fighting in the war of resistance who are in occupied areas or close to war zones, helping them to move to the rear. Those who are unable to move should be given subsidies and assistance in caring for them. (B) The local government, together with the local relief agencies, shall provide relief to the families of those fighting in the war of resistance whose clothing, food, and housing have been burned by the enemy or who have been forced to flee and are unable to make a living.

Editorial

### China's Foreign Trade and Japan

The Chinese government's control over wartime foreign trade began in March of last year. However, the restrictions on import and export commodities at that time were not very strict, resulting in a trade deficit of 120 million yuan last year, which further increased to 320 million yuan in the first half of this year. In order to balance international payments, the government strengthened control over foreign trade starting in June of this year, prohibiting the import of non-essential and luxury goods and increasing the quantity of export goods through various incentives. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. In August, there was a trend of reduced imports and increased exports. The situation improved further in September: according to figures released by the Customs, the value of imported foreign goods was 93 million yuan, a decrease of 35 million compared to August; the export value was 85 million yuan, a decrease of 15 million compared to August; the trade deficit dropped to 8 million yuan. This is the smallest amount in the first nine months of this year.

A trade deficit of 8 million yuan in September was not a particularly alarming figure before January of this year: not only were there many months with even smaller figures, but there were also trade surpluses from October to December of the previous year and from June to September of last year. However, we must understand that the situation in the previous two years was completely different from the recent one: First, a year ago, from Ningbo along the coast southward to Guangzhou Bay, China still had several ports for handling imports and exports, which were both controlled and utilized. Recently, there are almost no ports for handling imports and exports. Second, when China had a trade surplus in the past, the amount of foreign trade that the Chinese government could control was relatively large, and at the same time, the Japanese side had not yet paid attention to the foreign trade in the occupied areas due to their busy military operations. The recent situation is exactly the opposite of the past: the expansion of the war zone has reduced the amount of trade that the government can control; and Japan is also making every effort to control trade in the occupied areas. Estimating the trade in the war zone based on peacetime economic geography, the war zone accounts for more than 80 percent of the national trade volume. Therefore, during wartime, due to the movement of population and capital, and production tools, and the changes in consumable goods, this percentage is of course inaccurate; however, it is truly commendable that the trade deficit has been reduced this time. The reason for this is partly due to the government's effective control and partly due to the fact that most people can conscientiously abide by national laws to express their loyalty to the country. As for the impact of the European War, although it has a considerable relationship, it is for both imports and exports.

China's foreign trade, like the entire China, has unlimited prospects. The foreign trade directly controlled by it has long become a favorable trend: from January to August of this year, the foreign trade deficit outside the war zone has turned into a deficit of 43 million yuan; and the southwestern customs still have more trade surpluses. Recently, the government has been able to reduce the trade deficit within the occupied areas by various methods. This is a success of China's trade policy and a clear evidence of Japan's relative inferiority in the economic struggle. Moreover, judging from the future trend, it will further enable China's foreign trade to achieve very smooth development: because Japan's economic activities in the occupied areas, on the one hand, are attempting to expand its own economic power, and at the same time, it is also excluding the rights and interests of third parties in order to monopolize everything; it is not only excluding the trade of European and American countries with China, but even prohibiting the trade of European and American countries with China. For example, the long-term blockade of the Yangtze River is a clear example. However, Japan's monopolistic actions have recently been deeply resented by the relevant countries in Europe and the United States: those who originally made concessions to Japan now hope to turn to retaliation. The Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce recently published a communique openly criticizing Japan's so-called "Far East New Order" as actually "Far East Disorder," and therefore expressed their need for some "fresh air." This represents the general opinion of British merchants in the occupied areas. The American overseas Chinese in Shanghai also sent a telegram to the American government not long ago, requesting that the amendment to the Neutrality Act avoid being unfavorable to China. A Washington telegram stated that the US Senate verbally voted to allow American ships to sail in the Pacific, which is undoubtedly an indication that the United States will never give up the opportunity for trade with China. We can also refer to the fact that the US government has recently repeatedly expressed a tough attitude on the Far East issue, which clearly shows that it has the determination to protect its rights and interests in China. Isn't this enough to break Japan's attempt to monopolize China's wartime foreign trade and greatly help the natural development of China's wartime foreign trade?

However, some people may think that even if Britain, the United States, and other countries can remove obstacles to trade with China and operate freely, but because China lacks important coastal ports that it can control, the result may still inevitably indirectly benefit the economic resources controlled by Japan in the occupied areas. In fact, this is also an unnecessary worry: we must know that under the current Japanese blockade policy, imported goods from European and American countries are completely blocked; and exports to European and American countries must also be monopolized by the Japanese side before they can be exported. As long as we achieve the goal of breaking the Japanese monopoly policy, we will expose the failure of Japanese economic activities in the occupied areas, and at the same time, it will be nothing less than a new opportunity for China's foreign trade! The subtle key lies in the fact that if Japan cannot give up aggression, it cannot establish a normal relationship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and it cannot develop normal industry and commerce. At the same time, it can also be asserted that if Japan does not give up aggression, it will never implement its promise to open its doors and respect the rights and interests of all countries.

### German Foreign Minister's Speech in Danzig: Determined to Accept British Challenge, Saying Britain Should Bear the Primary Responsibility for the War, Unwilling to Make Peace Without Guaranteed Security

Danzig - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a speech here last night to the public, broadcast by all German radio stations and translated into various languages for broadcast abroad. The main points of the speech were: (1) vehemently criticizing Britain, accusing Britain of imposing war on Germany; (2) the restoration of the inherent friendly relations between Germany and the Soviet Union; (3) Germany has no ambitions towards the Americas; (4) Danzig will never be separated from Germany again.

Ribbentrop's conclusion stated, "We will never make peace until we have a guarantee that such attacks on the German people will never happen again. We firmly believe that we are in the right. We tried our best to avert the war imposed on us until the very last minute. With this belief, we will fight to the end with all our energy, only when Germany wins a great victory. Our country will use all its strength and trust in the greatest figure among us, our leader, to deal with the enemy," (Reuter's dispatch, 25th).

German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop

Danzig - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a speech in Danzig last night, reviewing the Polish war and the course of Britain and France's declaration of war against Germany. Ribbentrop declared that he believed the world knew that the French did not want to fight, and that the British government had systematically planned a decisive battle against Germany since the Munich Conference, so they used the Polish incident as an excuse to provoke Germany. After Hitler's peace proposal was rejected, Germany decided to accept this challenge, and the German people should be determined not to lay down their arms halfway until national security is guaranteed.

Ribbentrop briefly described the history of Danzig and the German-Polish relations over the past six years, declaring that exactly one year ago, he was ordered by Leader Hitler to propose to the Polish ambassador to Germany, Lipski, to politically merge Danzig with Germany and maintain economic ties with Poland, and at the same time propose the construction of railways and highways, mutual recognition of borders, and the extension of the 1934 non-aggression pact for twenty-five years. At that time, Leader Hitler also personally reiterated this intention to Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. On March 21st of this year, he again proposed to Lipski for the third time to discuss that German-Polish relations must be clarified, and invited Polish Foreign Minister Beck to come to Germany for negotiations. Unexpectedly, Lipski submitted a memorandum on the 25th of the same month that was equivalent to a complete rejection of Ribbentrop's proposal, claiming that "If the German plan is forced again, it is tantamount to wanting to fight against Poland." At the same time, Poland increased the persecution of Germans and strengthened the troops on the German-Polish border. Germany tolerated it for half a year, until the Polish army invaded, it could not but respond with force. Now, Germany has personally seen the division of the area of ​​interest and the realization of true peace. Germany and Russia will forever be the guarantee of a peaceful and orderly Eastern Europe.

### Peaceful Efforts Fruitless

At this point, Ribbentrop elaborated on German foreign policy, declaring that since January 30, 1933, the purpose of German foreign policy has been to destroy the Treaty of Versailles and eliminate all the consequences caused by it, and has achieved some success by methods that do not shed a drop of blood. Britain has repeatedly obstructed this, while Germany has still made various efforts to attempt to obtain a reasonable agreement with Britain and France. In the summer of 1933, Germany proposed a meeting between the German and French Prime Ministers Hitler and Daladier, and the plan was on the verge of being decided, but was then cancelled by Daladier. Is this not a historical regret? Since Hitler came to power, the foundation of German foreign policy has been to promote British-German relations. Hitler's repeated speeches and Ribbentrop's repeated trips to London were all specifically for obtaining British-German understanding. This is not just empty talk, but a concrete proposal. Ribbentrop, in the name of Leader Hitler, proposed the following four points to the British Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary, and other politicians:

(1) British-German naval understanding, based on the ratio of 35 to 100; (2) eternal guarantee of the integrity of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France; (3) Germany respects British interests throughout the world, and Britain respects German interests in Eastern Europe; (4) British-German defensive alliance, stipulating that Germany is willing to provide its fleet and some of its land army for British command to protect the British Empire.

As a result, the response from British politicians and public opinion has been to inform the Germans that Britain does not need German friendship.

### No Conflict of Interest Between Soviet Union and Germany

Regarding German-Soviet relations, Ribbentrop declared that the vital interests of the two countries are interconnected, do not conflict, economic needs are mutually complementary, and territorial disputes will never occur. The people of the two countries have expressed great enthusiasm for the non-aggression pact and border friendship agreement. German-Soviet relations have reached a final and clear foundation, and this friendship will only deepen day by day.

### Germany Has Absolutely No Ambitions Towards the Americas

As for German-American relations, Germany has always respected the American Monroe Doctrine. Germany has no interest in the American continent except for commercial relations. When Britain has repeatedly spread news of discord between Germany and the United States, Germany has always hoped that Americans can see through their tricks with common sense and understand that only friendship between Germany and the United States is beneficial to both sides.

### Who Should Be Held Responsible for the War?

At this point, Ribbentrop discussed the question of "who is the culprit of this war," declaring that the world knows that France does not want to fight. There is no doubt that France is willing to negotiate peace, but it is forced to fight. In fact, the British government has been secretly making organized preparations for war for more than a day. Since the Munich Conference, Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately announced a huge military buildup plan, which proves that Chamberlain's trip to Munich was not to stop the war but to delay it. Therefore, when Germany annexed the Sudetenland, the British government did not use force, because its military was not sufficient, it was not unwilling to do so. When the Polish incident occurred, the British government's guarantee was specifically aimed at Germany, not advising Poland to consider peace proposals, but encouraging it to fight. When Italian Prime Minister Mussolini made a final mediation proposal on September 2nd, it was still possible to pull back from the brink, but Chamberlain stubbornly refused.

### Germany Has No Other Demands Than Colonies

The British side has publicized that Germany has the ambition to dominate the world. In fact, Germany has absolutely no colonies, while Britain has 611 autonomous territories, colonies, protectorates, and mandated territories. This kind of slander can be refuted without any explanation. Hitler has repeatedly stated that Germany's diplomatic objectives are no more than three points:

(1) To allow Germans to live in their natural territory; (2) To guarantee the German people an appropriate standard of living; (3) To enable the German people to develop their culture.

Now Germany's unification work has ended, the Treaty of Versailles has been cancelled, and Germany's borders in all four directions have been finally determined. Germany has no other demands from Britain and France except to recover its old colonies. However, the central government believes that today is the time for Britain and Germany to fight. This policy is a gamble on the fate of the British Empire, and in history, it may be the British Empire digging its own grave. If it is said that Germany has kept its promises, then Britain's violation of the Munich Agreement is not a breach of promise. Chamberlain's so-called peace is to return to the Treaty of Versailles, to stop National Socialism, in other words, to make the German nation cease to exist and the European situation to fall into chaos, but this will never be done. Germany has now decided to accept Chamberlain's challenge and will never lay down its arms until Germany's security is guaranteed, so that the German nation will never again be threatened by this kind of attack.

### English and French Newspapers' Comments: No Novel Points Seen, Considered To Be Issued Domestically

London - Official sources here have commented on the speech delivered by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday, saying that it was issued domestically, and even before a lengthy study, it is known that it has no novel points and no special importance. However, Germany's attempt to alienate Britain and France can be clearly seen here. Ribbentrop also wanted to try his best to conceal the truth before the German people, and did not hesitate to distort Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy when he concluded the Munich Agreement last September. This kind of lie is difficult for even a three-year-old child to believe (Havas, 25th).

London - The speech delivered by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Danzig last night, accusing Britain of preparing for war long ago, has not been criticized by most newspapers here today. Although it was published with headlines such as "barbaric accusations" and "exaggerations of the disturbed," only the "Daily Mail" and "News Chronicle" still consider it to be of value for discussion and criticism. The "Daily Mail" said that the world has seen a mixture of distorted facts, insincere words, and pure lies. The "News Chronicle" said that what Ribbentrop said did not make the key point of why people oppose Nazism any weaker. What is this key point? That is, Germany has destroyed all hope of a peaceful settlement and repeatedly violated promises to engage in aggression while pursuing its greed and ambition (Reuter, 25th).

Paris - Few newspapers here have commented on the speech delivered by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Danzig yesterday, and they said that this speech has no novel points, and its function is domestic rather than external. The "Right-wing Order Newspaper" stated, "All that a vulgar person can say has now been added. The remarks made by the leaders of the National Socialist Party are shameless, just like their actions. The main goal of Ribbentrop's speech is to conceal the predicament created by the country's leader Hitler from the German people." The "Right-wing Daily" stated, "This speech did not add any new factors to the current international situation. It is really not worth it to spend two hours consulting with Hitler before publishing such ordinary words." (Havas, 25th)

Denmark - "National Daily" reported that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech showed that the offensive will only be against Britain and its territories from now on (Reuter, 25th).

### Another Four British Ships Sunk by German Submarines, Most of the Crew Rescued by American Ships, One Swedish and One Greek Ship Sunk in the North Sea

Gibraltar - It is heard that the British ship "Taffna" was sunk by a German submarine on October 24 (Reuter, 25th).

London - Another three British ships were attacked by German submarines. The three ships are the "Kranjichsom" (2,647 tons) cargo ship "Lightburg" (3,528 tons) and the "Manning Lodge." In addition, one Swedish and one Greek ship of neutral countries were sunk by German mines or German submarines. According to the announcement of the US Maritime Commission in Washington, the US ship "Kronstad" has rescued five survivors of the "Manning Lodge" and the entire crew of the "Lightburg." Both of these ships were sunk in the North Atlantic. Twenty-two crew members of the "Manning Lodge" are missing. The Greek ship lost was the "Hachibataoras" (4,684 tons), which was sunk by a German submarine in the North Sea. Fifteen crew members were rescued by a British ship and transferred to lifeboats to land. Three crew members and a British pilot are still missing. When the rescued people arrived in England in lifeboats, they were taken to a seafarer's dormitory by ambulances (Reuter, 25th).

Oslo, Norway - According to the crew of the "Stonemont" who arrived in Norway yesterday, the "Stonemont" was not sunk by a German submarine, but by the pocket battleship "Deutschland." The crew of the "Stonemont" were all rescued by the pocket battleship (Haitong Dispatch, 25th).

London - First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill recently stated in the House of Commons that the circumstances surrounding the sinking of the battleship "Royal Oak" are being investigated urgently. It is difficult to know exactly when a report can be submitted, but it is hoped that the results of the investigation can be reported next week (Havas, 25th).

### British Prime Minister to Deliver Speech in House of Commons, Responding to German Foreign Minister's Remarks

London - Sources say that Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to make a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon to respond to the speech delivered by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Danzig. However, according to well-informed sources, the Prime Minister will not make any response when the House of Commons meets today, but will address it when submitting the weekly report in the House of Commons tomorrow (Havas, 25th).

### Roman Silence

Rome - People here originally thought that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop would definitely avoid directly mentioning the two Allied countries of Britain and France when he delivered his speech yesterday. Now that Ribbentrop has attacked Britain so fiercely, it is quite surprising. Many Italian political figures said that Germany should adopt a large-scale offensive in all three aspects of land, sea, and air, but official sources refused to express their opinions. All newspapers have been ordered to be cautious in their words when publishing comments (Havas, 25th).

### Berlin Denies Military Conference

Berlin - The German official news agency stated that the attitude adopted by Germany after British Prime Minister Chamberlain rejected the German peace proposal is well known. Germany sees no reason to launch a new peace movement. The official arena has considered the rumor that Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have made extremely important discussions on the international situation in the past few days to be unfounded, and that the ambassadors stationed in the Soviet Union and Italy have been ordered to send special reports to the German government is also inconsistent with the facts. The news about military conferences circulated abroad is also fictitious (Reuter, 25th).

### Hitler Receives Oshima

Berlin - German Leader Hitler received Japanese Ambassador Oshima at the Prime Minister's Office yesterday. He has been summoned back to his country and is about to depart. Oshima stated that he was instructed by the government to express his firm belief in the continued maintenance of German-Japanese friendly relations (Haitong Dispatch, 25th).

Berlin - Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima was summoned back to his country and is about to depart. Last night, he visited Hitler to bid farewell and presented four pieces of art gifts from a Japanese manufacturer to the German Leader (Reuter, 25th).

### British-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Treaty Based on Encirclement Policy Italian Newspaper Article Doubts Whether It Can Be a Tool for Peace

London - Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that due to special circumstances, the British-French-Turkish treaty is planned to be signed as soon as possible and will now be submitted to the King for approval. It is hoped that it can be signed in Turkey's capital next week (Reuter, 25th).

Rome - Today's "Italian Daily" published an article by Geda, expressing doubts about whether the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance treaty can be a tool for peace, saying that the starting point of this treaty is based on "the British-French encirclement policy," which aims to prevent Italy's expansion in the Mediterranean. Although Turkey has signed this treaty, it is still affiliated to the Balkan Entente group. This matter has created new problems in the Balkan system. After Albania was incorporated into Italy, Italy's policy extended to the center of the Balkan countries. This is the fundamental point. Some newspapers exaggerated and viewed the signing of the British-French-Turkish treaty as a lover's meeting, wanting to obscure the facts, but Italy turned a deaf ear to it, but will continue to watch the consequences of the evolution of the facts with very sharp eyes (Reuter, 25th).

### Finnish Representative Returns Home for Instructions; Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Interrupted, But Not Necessarily a Breakdown; Rumor of New Soviet Demands

Moscow: The Finnish delegation returned to its capital this morning at 00:30. The delegation's chief representative, Paasikivi, told reporters before leaving, "I sincerely hope to return here soon to continue negotiations." It is rumored that the Soviet government has made new demands, which cannot be confirmed or denied here. The delegation denied rumors that it would not return or that future negotiations would be conducted through diplomatic channels. However, well-informed sources here still believe the negotiations are very tense and that the delegation still needs to travel back and forth several times. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)

The "Electric News" correspondent stationed in the Finnish capital reported that public sentiment had been optimistic about the Finnish-Soviet negotiations, but suddenly turned pessimistic yesterday. This suggests that the Soviet Union has made new demands that the Finnish representatives dare not take responsibility for negotiating and have returned home for instructions. Currently, the Finnish capital is stepping up military preparations, such as calling up reserves and building bomb shelters. This is indeed the case. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)

Stockholm: According to reliable sources from Finland, Soviet-Finnish negotiations are expected to resume in Moscow next week. Well-informed sources claim that the new Soviet proposals are merely slight changes to the previous ones and do not constitute new demands. The Finnish government will hold meetings in the next two days to specifically discuss the new Soviet proposals and draft new instructions to be given to chief representative Paasikivi. (Haitong Dispatch, 25th)

London: People in the Finnish capital were surprised when chief Finnish representative Paasikivi returned home just thirty-six hours after arriving in Moscow with other important delegates. It is reported that Paasikivi is seeking instructions from his government because Stalin has made new proposals. According to a Finnish capital dispatch from a Swedish newspaper, this is not a breakdown in negotiations but merely an attempt by the Soviet Union to unnerve Finland. Meanwhile, a dispatch from Rome quoting Moscow claims that the new Soviet proposals include: (1) special rights for the Soviet Union on certain islands in the Gulf of Finland; (2) Finland's commitment not to fortify the Åland Islands; and (3) Finland's commitment not to support any anti-Soviet actions. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

Basel, Switzerland: The "News" newspaper recently published a dispatch from its correspondent stationed in Stockholm, stating that despite optimistic views on the current Finnish-Soviet negotiations, there is no factual basis for them. According to reliable sources, Finnish representatives Paasikivi and Tanner looked dejected after a secret meeting with Stalin and Molotov yesterday and immediately reported to the government via long-distance telephone. Officials in the Finnish government also showed signs of unease. However, it is also said that although Paasikivi has returned home for instructions, two other representatives remain in Moscow to discuss various "technical issues" with the Soviet authorities when Paasikivi returns, indicating that negotiations have not broken down. Observers believe that the situation will not develop significantly before the 31st of this month. The Soviet side is likely in no hurry because the European war is raging, and Soviet-Finnish negotiations can proceed at a leisurely pace. Furthermore, the Swedish side attaches great importance to and comments extensively on the return of Soviet Ambassador to Sweden, Madame Kollontai, to report on the meeting of the heads of state of the four Nordic countries. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)

### German and Soviet Agreement Established; Soviet Union Agrees to Supply Germany with One Million Tons of Grain and Fodder in Two Months

Berlin: A German official press agency states that Germany and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement in which the Soviet Union will supply Germany with one million tons of grain and fodder within two months. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

Moscow: It is announced here that a Soviet economic delegation has departed for Berlin, consisting of 25 representatives, mostly from Soviet economic and engineering circles. The chief representative is the Soviet People's Commissar for the Shipping Industry, Tevosyan. (Haitong Dispatch, 25th)

Helsinki: It has been learned that several Soviet transportation experts are negotiating with the Estonian Ministry of Economy regarding the transit of Soviet goods through Estonian territory. It is said that the Soviet Union hopes that goods destined for Germany will pass through the Estonian capital, Tallinn, and warehouse leases have been signed, and special transportation agencies have been established. (Haitong Dispatch, 25th)

### In the Warndt Forest Area, German Attacks Repelled; General von Brauchitsch Inspects the Western Front in the West Wall Area

Paris: The General Headquarters has just released War Bulletin No. 101, stating, "Our forces set ambushes in various locations along the front line today and occasionally launched attacks. Enemy forces attacked our forward outposts southeast of the Warndt Forest, resulting in intense fighting. Our forces immediately counterattacked and repelled them." (Havas Dispatch, 24th)

Berlin: General von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, is currently inspecting the Western Front and consoling German troops in the Saarbrücken area, where fierce battles have recently taken place. Soldiers with outstanding combat records have been awarded the Iron Cross. (Haitong Dispatch, 25th)

London: The speech given by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Danzig last night has led military commentators here to re-evaluate the possibility of a German offensive. Although the front lines are currently experiencing continuous rain and flooding rivers, an offensive is still not difficult. National Socialists are now extremely excited, impatient, and confident. Germans are also feeling impatient with Hitler's indecision. Commentators also believe that German generals cannot allow the large army currently concentrated on the Siegfried Line to remain concentrated in this narrow area for long, so they must either make it fight or withdraw it. French critics say that although the Germans are confident they can break through the Maginot Line, considering the situation of the Eben-Emael fortress, whose construction was far less solid than the Maginot Line during the last major war, it is clear that the Germans will have difficulties. "Le Petit Parisien" published an article by Maurice, stating that British forces are now fighting German aircraft with the latest fighter planes, whose combat capabilities are far superior to the German Messerschmitt aircraft. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

Paris: Semi-official sources commented on the war situation, saying that both sides renewed activities in several places along the front line yesterday, with minor clashes, ambushes, or large reconnaissance patrols in the middle of the lines. All of these were local in nature and of no great significance. Both sides have established a new line somewhere in the front and are trying to improve their positions, hoping to repel enemy troops who are hindering their movements. Since the General Headquarters decided to adopt a defensive posture, it has abandoned a large part of the territory occupied in the Warndt Forest area. In the past two days, fierce fighting has taken place with enemy forces southeast of the forest. The high ground of strategic value remains in our hands. When the enemy first attacked, the scale was small, but because our forces resisted strongly, they gradually increased their pressure, and the fighting intensified accordingly. The General Headquarters finally ordered a counterattack to relieve the besieged forward outposts. When War Bulletin No. 101 was released last night, the counterattack was mentioned for the first time since the start of the war. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)

### The Four Countries of the Near East Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss the International Situation

Istanbul, Turkey: According to reliable sources, representatives from the Near East Pact signatory countries—Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan—will hold a meeting in the near future to discuss the international situation. Preliminary discussions and preparations are underway. The meeting will be held either in the Turkish capital or the Iraqi capital. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)

### Britain Eager to Promote Trade with Neutral Countries and Plans to Renew Barter Agreement with the Soviet Union

London: Secretary of Commerce Stanley stated in the House of Commons today that Britain would begin to increase its trade with the Netherlands, the Scandinavian Peninsula, and other neutral countries as soon as possible. When members asked if the Secretary of Commerce was aware of Germany's intensified efforts to promote its trade with the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries, Stanley replied that he had received reports of this nature. The British government is well aware of the importance of promoting British exports to these countries and other overseas markets. The Ministry of Commerce, for this purpose, is beginning discussions with representatives of the export industry to facilitate their operations. He is in constant contact with relevant departments regarding export trade matters. When further asked if the Secretary of Commerce was aware that German industrial groups were distributing leaflets to neutral companies, offering various conveniences to assist their trade in order to counter British trade, Stanley replied that it was doubtful whether the Germans could fulfill the promises in these leaflets. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)

London: During the House of Commons session today, members inquired about the issue of Britain and the Soviet Union renewing a new barter agreement suitable for wartime conditions. Foreign Minister Butler replied that the issue was currently under consideration. It is understood that Britain and the Soviet Union recently agreed on an agreement for Britain to exchange rubber and tin for Soviet timber. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

### Japan Leaves the Sterling Bloc; London Not Surprised

London: Japan's decision to link the yen to the U.S. dollar instead of the pound has not caused surprise or dissatisfaction in financial circles here, but is seen as a reasonable step. It is said that since Britain and France are at war, there will inevitably be some fluctuations in the future levels of the pound and the franc. Japan is now merely following the example of the Scandinavian Peninsula countries in linking its currency to the U.S. dollar. In fact, the main currency currently far from the vortex of war is only the U.S. dollar. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

Tokyo: Today, foreign exchange transactions were conducted based on the new basis of 23.4375 U.S. cents per 100 Japanese yen, without fluctuations. The British exchange rate remained at one shilling and two pence, based on the British-U.S. exchange rate of 4.01875 U.S. dollars per British pound. Businesspeople here support the government's decision to link the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar, hoping that this move will not hinder Japan's overall import and export trade. Japanese newspapers all welcomed this decision, with most regretting that it was somewhat late. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

### British Aircraft Fly over Germany for Reconnaissance

London: The Ministry of Aviation has just announced that several of our aircraft flew over the German cities of Berlin, Magdeburg, and Hamburg last night for reconnaissance. At that time, the Hamburg radio station was broadcasting Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech in Danzig, which was reportedly interrupted as a result. (Havas, 25th)

### U.S. Secretary of State Hull Denies Conducting Far East Peace Movement; Peace Atmosphere Spread by Japanese Side; United States Encourages China to Continue Resistance

Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that he was completely unaware of reports that the United States was conducting a peace movement in the Far East. He had no knowledge of Japanese reports that China, through U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson, had proposed peace to the Japanese. Other government officials also did not acknowledge knowing about the Chinese peace proposal. Some believe that the Japanese reports were caused by a certain party eager to reassure the Japanese people that the end of the Sino-Japanese War was not far off. It is pointed out here that Tokyo sources solemnly declared last week that the end of Japan's war with China was near, and Japanese newspaper commentaries made even more solemn statements about this view. However, well-informed sources here stated that Washington has not received any reliable indications that the end of the Sino-Japanese War is imminent. Officials here are fully aware of Japan's eagerness to end the Sino-Japanese War. However, qualified observers solemnly stated that unless Japan changes its current policies and is willing to negotiate with General Chiang Kai-shek, there is currently no hope for Sino-Japanese peace. Some believe that regardless of the activities of peace elements in Chongqing, the firm stance taken by the United States in the Far East in the past two weeks will encourage China to continue resisting Japan. The Soviet Union's recent aid to China, such as Chinese air raids on Hankou and other Japanese bases, is another indication that China is not prepared to accept peace negotiations based on Japanese conditions. (Associated Press Dispatch, 25th)

### United States Actively Expanding the Strength of the Asian Fleet; Naval Department Plans to Continue Sending Warships to Manila; Naval Exercises Will Be Held in the Pacific

Washington: The Navy Department last night refused to confirm or deny reports that warships currently concentrated in the Hawaiian area would continue to be sent to the Philippines. According to unconfirmed reports, the strength of the "security patrol" recently established by the United States in the Pacific may be increased. The Naval Department plans to continue sending warships to Manila to reinforce the U.S. Asian Fleet. However, the Navy Department remained tight-lipped about the movements of warships in the Hawaiian area. Navy Department officials stated that except for warships stationed on the West Coast returning to West Coast naval shipyards for inspection, current naval policy does not allow for the announcement of warship movements. Therefore, the Navy Department will only be able to publicly announce routine warship movements in the future. Observers recalled the naval authorities recently dispatching an air force squadron and greatly increasing the number of U.S. submarines in the Far East to increase the combat effectiveness of the U.S. East Asian Fleet, considering it to be very important. At this time, the U.S. Navy is continuing preparations for the annual naval exercises. Although the location of the naval exercises in February next year has not been confirmed, preparations are being made on a minute-by-minute basis. Reliable sources indicated that the naval exercises will be held in the Pacific, as a large number of warships are gathered there. Observers pointed out that the Pacific is a reasonable location for the next naval exercises, as the Navy has previously held them in the Atlantic and Caribbean. Since the outbreak of the European war, this issue has become more complicated. Some non-official sources predict that the naval exercises will be held in the Atlantic. The Navy Department refused to comment on this prediction yesterday, stating that the location of the naval exercises has not yet been determined. The possibility of naval exercises being held in the Atlantic is only speculation. Naval experts would be surprised if warships were transferred from the Pacific to the Atlantic for short-term exercises. Navy Department officials stated that the progress of various plans can be changed at any time. Strategists are planning the exercise program, but the Chief of Naval Operations is not yet prepared to make any detailed public announcements. Yesterday, unofficial reports widely circulated that some of the warships currently stationed in Hawaii would be transferred back to the West Coast next year for inspection. It was also reported here that the Navy Department may advance the transfer of these warships to the West Coast so that Navy sailors can spend Christmas with their families. (Associated Press Dispatch, 25th)

### United States Prevents Soviet-Japanese Rapprochement; Nomura Will Meet with Grew

Moscow: The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia recently published a dispatch from a "special correspondent" claiming that responsible parties in the United States believe that Japan is willing to improve relations with the Soviet Union and purchase goods from the Soviet Union so as not to rely entirely on the United States. If this were to be realized, it would strengthen Japan's position, which is not in the U.S.'s interest. Therefore, the U.S. plans to interfere and, using the pretext of pursuing a neutral policy, prevent the rapprochement between Japan and the Soviet Union and isolate Japan. This news has attracted the attention of foreigners here, who say that the U.S.'s expression of sympathy for Britain and France is not pleasing to the Soviet Union, so it is indirectly attacking the U.S. in this way. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)

Moscow: Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky departed today via Romania and Italy to take up his new post in the United States. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)

Tokyo: At a press conference today, a spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was asked by an American reporter when Foreign Minister Nomura would begin negotiations with U.S. Ambassador Grew. The spokesman replied that Nomura would meet with Grew soon, but he could not say for sure when. It is understood that Nomura recently told reporters that he wanted to freely and frankly exchange views with the U.S. Ambassador on the situation in East Asia. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

### Soviet Union Strengthens Fishing Fleet

Moscow: Russia is currently modernizing and expanding its fishing fleet, building some new ships and renovating old ones. Two tugboats, each with 650 horsepower, are currently being built in the Murmansk shipyard. The Northern Fishing Fleet will also add four fishing boats with 60 to 110 horsepower gasoline engines. The Far East Fisheries Agency will add 150 ships and has ordered that all wooden ships be replaced with metal ships next year. (Haitong Dispatch, 25th)

### Soviet Union Announces New Military Service Law; Enlistment Age Lowered

Moscow: The Soviet Supreme Soviet passed a military service law last month, the content of which has just been announced. In addition to reducing the enlistment age for young people from 19 to 18, the military training methods in secondary schools will also be changed. Students must receive military training from the age of 13 until they enlist at the age of 18 (the original method was that students had only three years of military training before enlisting at the age of 19). (Havas Dispatch, 24th)

### U.S. Protests German Seizure of U.S. Ship; Demands Full Explanation from Germany; Soviet Union Considering Releasing the Ship

Washington: The U.S. State Department has instructed the U.S. Embassy in Germany to demand a full explanation from Germany regarding the reported seizure of the U.S. ship City of Flint by a German warship. It is expected that the U.S. will request the Soviet government to release the ship, as it is understood that after the City of Flint arrived in Murmansk, the Soviet government impounded the ship on the grounds that, except under special circumstances, Germany had no right to escort a ship into a neutral port. Secretary of State Hull discussed the seizure of the City of Flint while hosting reporters, saying that more than half of the ship's cargo was conditionally contraband, and a small part was absolutely contraband. Hull was unwilling to say what action the U.S. government would take, but said that this incident clearly involved capture procedures. If so, this was consistently done by force. According to information received here, the U.S. crew and flag of the ship have been replaced by a German crew and flag. President Roosevelt also mentioned this matter when hosting reporters, saying that the U.S. government is still trying to inquire with the Soviet Union about the details of the ship's seizure, but has not yet received information on the ship's current location. President Roosevelt went on to answer reporters' questions, saying that, as far as ship seizure is concerned, all government ships do indeed have the same status as private ships. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has reported here, stating that all the facts have not yet been fully ascertained. A reporter also asked President Roosevelt whether, under current laws, he had the power to order U.S. ships not to enter war zones. President Roosevelt replied "No," and said that he hoped to get the City of Flint back. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

London: According to Norwegian sources received here today, the ship that seized the U.S. ship City of Flint was the German cruiser Emden. It was previously heard that one or two armed German merchant ships were conducting raiding operations at sea, but it is only now known that there is a German warship on the high seas. It is understood that the Emden was built at the end of 1925, with a displacement of 5,400 tons and eight 6-inch guns. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

Washington: The legal basis for the Soviet Union's detention of the U.S. ship City of Flint has now sparked lively discussions. It is expected that this matter may allow the Soviet Union to express its general attitude. U.S. Navy Department legal expert Axel said that if the Soviet Union does not openly stand on the German side, it will return the ship. Princeton University law professor Corwin said that if the Soviet Union remains neutral, the U.S. can file a protest and demand its release. However, if the Soviet Union indicates that it is one of the belligerents, then all ships carrying contraband into the Soviet Union will be subject to seizure by the Allied countries. Neutral ships captured in this environment can only enter neutral ports in the event of severe weather, damage to the ship, or lack of food. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)

New York: Regarding the detention of the U.S. cargo ship "City of Flint" in the Soviet port of Murmansk, morning newspapers here all expressed dissatisfaction, but their tone was still moderate. The New York Times stated, "The navies of belligerent countries originally have the right to inspect neutral ships if they are carrying contraband. The U.S. government has no objections to this. However, if German warships order ships of other countries to sail to neutral ports for detention without ascertaining what they are carrying, then the U.S. government should consider this an illegal action. The State Department has already telegraphed the ambassadors stationed in Germany and the Soviet Union, requesting the governments of the countries where they are stationed to provide explanations. Once these ambassadors have replied, the Soviet Union's position on Germany will be clear." The Public Opinion Forum discussed this issue from a legal point of view, stating that the way this case is resolved may cause significant difficulties from a technical perspective. "This case contains explosives and must be reviewed calmly." (Havas Dispatch, 25th)

### US Senate Approves Amendment to Neutrality Act: Eliminates Strict Shipping Restrictions, Except for the Dangerous Zone of the North Atlantic

Washington - The Senate today approved an amendment to the government's Neutrality Act, removing stringent restrictions on American shipping, except for the dangerous zone of the North Atlantic. This amendment will allow American ships, excluding those carrying armaments, to transport any materials to belligerent ports in the South Atlantic, Pacific, Indian Ocean, China Sea, Tasman Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Bermuda, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The Senate also passed an amendment allowing inland commerce with Canada and Mexico to continue as usual, without requiring purchasers to possess ownership certificates for goods before they cross the border. Furthermore, the Senate accepted a proposal to delete a clause in the bill that would have allowed belligerent nations to purchase goods on 90 days' credit. Democratic Senator Connally criticized the capture of the American ship Flint City, saying that the shipping restrictions in the bill could prevent the recurrence of such incidents, and the Senate should pay attention to this. (Reuters, 24th)

Washington - Today was the first day the Senate discussed the Neutrality Act amendment clause by clause. All important proposals put forward by senators advocating the abolition of the arms embargo were voted on and passed. The majority vote obtained was at least fifty out of ninety votes. Although the Senate unanimously passed a motion yesterday limiting speaking time to no more than forty-five minutes, today's discussion was so rapid that it was not necessary to implement this restriction. From this, it can be inferred that the government has won a victory. Congressional figures generally believe that the Senate can conclude the debate tomorrow or the day after. (Havas, 24th)

Washington - In yesterday's meeting, the Senate verbally approved amendments to the administrative authorities' proposed amendments to the Neutrality Act, allowing American ships to sail in the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean south of Bermuda. It is generally believed that this Neutrality Act amendment can be finalized on Friday or Saturday. Congressional leaders all believe that the House will take rapid action on this. Congress can close on November 10th. The amendment regarding ship navigation has been expanded, and American merchant ships can sail to Bermuda and, in special circumstances, to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The House debate will begin on Monday. Fourteen isolationist members of Congress met in Johnson's office yesterday. Key figures among the isolationists, along with La Follette, said that the final vote on the Neutrality Act amendment could be held on Friday or Saturday. The isolationists admitted defeat on Monday but declared that they would make a final effort in the House debate. (Associated Press, 25th)

Washington - The United States Senate passed two amendments to the Neutrality Act at its meeting yesterday. These amendments were both proposed by Pittman, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. (1) To allow American merchants to transport goods other than munitions to the ports of Bermuda, the South Atlantic, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, and the Bay of Bengal. (2) To eliminate the provision in the Neutrality Act regarding the 90-day loan arrangement for belligerent countries purchasing goods from the United States. (Haitong, 25th)

Washington - Congressman Hamilton Fish declared today that he was confident that the capture of the American ship Flint City would reduce the number of votes in the House in favor of the arms embargo. The New York News also holds this view. It is said that this action is bound to have a strong reaction to the debate on the Neutrality Act. (Reuters, 25th)

### March of Europe at War (Continued) - Special Correspondence from London

— Uncle Di

Yes, the one who just came upstairs was the old landlady here. Her intention was to ask me to go down to the basement level to avoid air raids. However, I am not going down.

"Don't worry, I don't believe Hitler's planes can rush into the skies above London" - that was my reason.

She smiled reassuringly. However, after carefully inspecting my gas mask again, she stubbornly placed it beside my elbow and whispered, "Okay, do as you wish. However, when you hear the first sound of the anti-aircraft guns, please come down." Then, she turned and went downstairs... Lamentable old woman! These past few days, she has been bearing deep worry for her only son, who has been called into military service....

For more than a year, in order to cover up their own unique diplomatic path, British figures like Chamberlain invented a verbal syllogism: "If Britain strongly opposes aggression, then Hitler will find it difficult to expand further. - If he cannot expand, Germany will definitely provoke a major war, and Britain will definitely be drawn into it. - However, Britain's preparations are not complete, so the current task is preparation; and diplomatically, we can only continue to make concessions to Germany."

"Preparation"! "Preparation"! And still "Preparation"! - This slogan covered up all the ugliness.

For more than a year, everyone's ears have almost developed calluses from hearing it; but, just last week, we still heard an important figure from Chamberlain's faction saying the same thing. However, a week later today, Britain declared war on Germany. What is the state of Britain's preparations after all? Everyone is concerned about this.

The aspect of pure military combat, let's not talk about that here. Let's briefly look at other aspects of Britain's preparations.

Isn't it said that the German air force's bombing of the rear is the most terrible? And, isn't it also said that Britain's air defense is inadequate? Apart from anti-aircraft guns, it is said that there is also a lack of anti-aircraft balloons.

However, now, just taking London as an example, there are more than eighteen thousand such balloons! More than two years ago, I was in the country, had been to both the north and south war zones, and had also stayed in Nanjing, which was bombed every day, but I never saw such balloons. But China fought the enemy in the same way. Now here, on this very first day of the declaration of war, I am able to gaze upon eighteen thousand such monsters in London. - This is a kind of silver-gray monster, each as big as a building, rising into the air, floating and floating. In dense places, looking at it suddenly, it looks like a pond full of lotus leaves.

Yes, and the most terrible thing is the enemy's poison gas. Therefore, the British authorities have universally issued a gas mask to everyone living on these three islands. Now, there are a total of forty-five million residents and foreigners living in the entire United Kingdom; however, Britain has prepared fifty-one million gas masks! In addition to everyone having already received one, there are still six million left, piled up in storage, as reserves. And Germany, which is known for having the most developed air force, her citizens do not have this good fortune of receiving a gas mask free of charge for each person. Germany's gas masks are mainly for export, to exchange for foreign exchange and raw materials. Not long ago, I heard that someone here was selling German-made gas masks, each priced at two pounds, twelve shillings, and sixpence. But its quality is not better than the British ones that are distributed for free, so the result is, naturally, no one cares.

For wartime service, the stretch bearer teams, fire brigades, ambulance teams, ...etc., that have already been registered nationwide in Britain, excluding the original, those still in service, the number of volunteers who have been temporarily called up alone, men and women combined, has already exceeded two million! In the near future, there will be another supplementary three hundred and fifty thousand people.

Also, food is a big problem. However, in European countries, most of which have declared food rationing systems, Britain has not yet adopted rationing. According to general estimates, for the past two or three years, the British Ministry of the Interior has been constantly stockpiling food. Even if Britain does not import any food from this point on, everything that is available can at least last for two or three years. Moreover, on the sea, there is a large fleet of merchant ships protected by its invincible navy. So, there is a very strange phenomenon here: two months ago, when the European situation was tense, you could see groups of women shopping for food, preparing to store it; but now that the war has really broken out, the phenomenon of storing food has disappeared.

The organization and capacity of Britain's transportation is also commendable. Just taking London as an example, three days ago, the British government began the evacuation of London residents. Within these three days, one and a half million people have been moved out of London by the government! Adding in those who moved out on their own, the number is at least three million. However, what attracts our attention is that there has been no congestion or disorder on the transportation lines. (3:30 AM, September 3rd)

(Note added on the morning of September 4th: Now I know that the air raid alarm last night was for a drill, not because enemy planes were actually coming. The official announcement of the results of this test was that it was "quite satisfactory." (End)

### Opium and Gambling Flourish in Suzhou: The People Suffer from the Policy of Poisoning

Suzhou Correspondence: Since the fall of this county two years ago, the social situation has reached an extreme state of disorder. The puppet organization has recently catered to the wishes of the Japanese side and implemented a policy of poisoning, opening a pseudo-local opium prohibition bureau to openly sell opium. The affairs of the prohibition bureau are presided over by Yang Qin-cheng. Branch bureaus in various townships are ordered by the local police to force people to obtain licenses to smoke opium. It is learned that the number of opium smokers in the county has exceeded 10,000. There are thirty-seven Class A opium dens, more than two hundred and fifty Class B, and over five hundred Class C. Compared with before the war, the number of opium smokers and opium dens has increased more than tenfold. Regarding gambling, there were thirty-one gambling houses in the urban area last autumn. Recently, the Japanese military police have notified the owners of various gambling houses, ordering them to obtain licenses and officially gamble openly. As a result, smaller gambling houses have closed down due to operating expenses. Currently, only the gambling houses near Guanqian, the North Bureau, and in the Shilu area of Changmen remain. It is said that more than ten thousand people go in and out every day.

### The Crucial Issues and Improvement Methods of Relief and Education for Refugee Children (3)

— Qian Yonghe

(II) Education and Nurturing

(1) Subsistence expenses: The greatest need for relief of refugee children is living expenses. The minimum standard is a food cost of one dime per child per day. If 30,000 refugee children are rescued from the war zone, the food cost for one day is 3,000 yuan, totaling 90,000 yuan per month. When they arrive at orphanages, teaching centers, or nursery homes, they must be equipped with clothing, trousers, shoes, socks, bedding, tents, mats, and cushions for all four seasons, costing 30 yuan per child, totaling 900,000 yuan for 30,000 people. Medical expenses and various equipment in the institution, and the salaries of teachers and staff, are not included. On average, each child needs to spend 40 yuan on all supplies when admitted to the institution, and the monthly regular education and nurturing expenses are 10 yuan. With 30,000 children, 4.8 million yuan will be spent in one year. Afterwards, as the war zone expands, refugee relief groups will take in more refugee children, and the expenses will be even more extensive. This large amount of subsistence expenses must be subsidized by the government as much as possible, and the generous donations of enthusiastic people at home and abroad can be maintained. However, in fact, in cities with a higher standard of living, one dime per child per day is not enough for food. Initially, the refugee children admitted had particularly many diseases, and medical expenses averaged 5 dimes per child per month. Due to economic difficulties, some orphanages, teaching centers, or nursery homes had to reduce the three meals a day to two, or even just one bowl of porridge and one bowl of rice, leaving children in their teens who are growing and developing half-starved and lacking nutrition, leading to yellow skin and thinness. Furthermore, due to the meager treatment of teachers and staff, the institution had to provide food and drink, and as a result, the food of the teachers, staff, and workers was still included in the food cost of 3 yuan per child per month. In institutions with fewer than one hundred children, each child only received 2 yuan worth of meals per month. If food management is done well, it can be barely maintained. Although it is a year of good harvests and rice is cheap, the price of firewood, charcoal, and kerosene has skyrocketed several times, and the cost of living in cities has further increased. Winter is approaching, and a large number of winter clothing and quilts need to be added, and a set of clothing and bedding for each child costs 20 yuan, costing 600,000 yuan for 30,000 children. The recent surge in the number of refugee children rescued from bombings in various places has not yet been included. Therefore, the government and society must find more ways to raise funds for the subsistence expenses of refugee children.

(2) Disease Treatment: Refugee children who have escaped from the war zone have experienced many hardships, exposed to the elements, and lived in dirty environments, so most of them are sick. Scabies, mange, and trachoma, these common diseases, are suffered by almost 80-90% of them. Stomach diseases, lung diseases, and syphilis are also not uncommon. The first thing to do when refugee children are sent to orphanages, teaching centers, or nursery homes is to bathe, change clothes, shave their heads, scrape their eyes, and examine their bodies. Some diseases can be cured by the doctor's instructions and simple nursing care, with the assistance of teachers and staff. Some diseases must be sent to the hospital. Therefore, medical expenses are also an important part of refugee relief. The most difficult thing is that there are too many sick children, and there are too few doctors, nurses, and medicines. This problem is even more serious in inland institutions. Sometimes even gauze and cotton are lacking. In summer, without mosquito nets, refugee children are bitten by mosquitoes and black insects. In autumn, malaria is prevalent, and poisonous sores cover the body. There are even cases where all the children in the institution are sick, and death is inevitable. Treatment also takes time. The mental suffering of refugee children who are separated from their parents and suffer from illness can be imagined. The illness before admission is unavoidable, and the illness after admission is partly due to poor management. For example, children's food is not nutritious enough, and often each child eats seven or eight bowls of rice, causing the stomach capacity to expand and reduce elasticity, leading to stomach diseases. Insufficient beds and bedding, two children share a quilt, children with scabies, children with trachoma, or children with scabies sleep together, resulting in one child contracting two or three diseases. In addition, the clothes of sick children are not separated clearly, not disinfected, and not washed, and most sick children cannot be absolutely isolated, and they are repeatedly infected, becoming a common phenomenon. The benevolent intention of rescuing refugee children has led to facts that harm refugee children, which are also heard from time to time. Some institutions borrow temples and ancestral halls, which have few windows and are very humid. Refugee children often lie on the floor, and in summer, the humidity is high, and athlete's foot is difficult to treat. In winter, due to the lack of winter clothing and quilts, frostbite has also become a popular disease. Throughout the year, refugee children suffer from rotating illnesses, or even all illnesses. Therefore, the treatment of refugee children's diseases is a most serious problem.

### Finance: Buying Sentiment Increases, Foreign Exchange Rebounds and Tightens, Sassoon Continues to Absorb, Hong Kong Settles Forward Contracts

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listed rates. In the off-exchange market for British and American currencies, the trend was a rebound and softening due to excessive loosening the previous day, fluctuating around the five-office mark, which was within expectations. This was because no major players were heard to have entered the market in the past two days, and most suppliers are now raising prices, so the available funds are not sufficient. Yesterday, due to only half a day of trading on Wednesday, the market initially opened tight at 0.3125 and 0.0625, with British gold at four offices and 9375, and the US dollar at eight yuan and 25. Subsequently, Sassoon continued to push up the price, and it was reported that foreign firms and Chinese merchants were also buying in, and Hong Kong Electric was buying forward contracts, which led to an expansion of buying sentiment. It softened again to four shillings and 875, and the US dollar to eight yuan and 125. However, the buying and selling suddenly became moderate, and it once showed a slight firming, but ultimately, due to Yuli and the Japanese banks entering the market to search for funds, the price tightened again, with British gold quoted at seven-eight-one-two-five shillings, and the US dollar also breaking into the eight-yuan mark, softening to seven yuan and 9375. At the close of trading, the tightest price for British gold was four shillings and seven-eight-one-two-five offices, tighter by one-eight-seven-five than the previous day, and the US dollar was eight yuan, softer by three-one-two-five than the previous day. British currency was tighter than the US dollar, which was because the US and British mutual exchange rates had risen for two consecutive days. It was heard that there were futures transactions, and the situation was the same as in the spot market, with half-day trading still brisk.

US Dollar Once Reached the Eight Yuan Mark

Early in the morning, London's long-term bill increased by 5 points, and the forward rate increased by 375 points. New York silver prices rose by 375 points. London's raw gold remained stable. The exchange rates for British, American, and French currencies were flat, while the exchange rate against Shanghai decreased by 125 points. The US dollar rose by 625 points against the British pound, increased by a tenth of a yuan against Shanghai, and increased by 25 points against the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The bank's opening selling price for spot goods in the morning was four shillings and 9375 for British gold and eight yuan and 25 for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was tighter by 0.3125 and the US dollar was softer by 0.0625. After the opening, Sassoon came back to push up settlements, and Hong Kong Electric suddenly bought US dollar futures for November at eight yuan. It was also heard that Chinese merchants and foreign firms were also following suit, leading to a continued trend towards expansion. Sassoon bought spot British gold at four shillings, 90625, and 875 from Dutch McCalee, followed by foreign firms settling spot US dollars at eight yuan, 1875, and 125. At that time, Hong Kong Electric bought November US dollars from a certain bank at eight yuan. HSBC's listed rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced as one and a half cents higher. Afterwards, the buying sentiment slightly subsided and briefly turned flat. It was heard that foreign firms had traded spot British gold at four shillings, 90625. At the same time, spot US dollars also rebounded to eight yuan, 1875. Subsequently, Yinhang Youli suddenly absorbed funds on behalf of a certain party, and Japanese banks also followed suit, so the situation tightened and softened again. Yuli and the Japanese banks bought spot British gold at four shillings, 84375, and 78125, and spot US dollars tightened from eight yuan, 125, to seven yuan, 9375. The situation slightly stabilized at noon. Extending to the noon close, the bank's selling price for spot goods was four shillings, 78125 for British gold and eight yuan for the US dollar. The rates for the current month were the same as for spot goods. The rates for November were four shillings, 734375 for British gold and seven yuan, 90625 for the US dollar. As a result, British currency was tighter than the US dollar. The spot and forward British currency were both tighter by 1875, while the US currency was softer by 3125. There was no market in the afternoon due to Wednesday being a half-day.

No Changes in Hong Kong British Currency Exchange Rate

Hong Kong, 15th Dispatch. The exchange rate market opened flat this morning. The spot and forward rates for British currency remained unchanged. The spot rate for the US dollar softened by 0.0625 to $25.125. The spot rate for Shanghai currency remained open at $295 without any changes. The spot rate for Japanese currency tightened by 75 to $106. At 9:45 AM, the spot rate for Shanghai currency rose by $3 to $298. At 9:55 AM, it continued to rise by $2 to $300. At 11:30 AM, it was calm and unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon due to Wednesday.

Tianjin US Dollar Out at Eight Yuan

The "Joint Banknote" black market was 3 yuan cheaper at 98 and a half yuan.

### Gold Market Rises

Hong Kong Merchants' Appetite is Weak

Yesterday's spot raw gold black market situation saw a sudden rise after six days of sharp decline. However, people's hearts were still lacking in stimulation, and the overall situation shifted with the loosening of the exchange rate market. The morning opening was 3,820 yuan, which was 55 yuan higher than yesterday, due to the tightening of the exchange rate, and sellers temporarily took a wait-and-see attitude. However, after hearing that the exchange rate market had stabilized, money changers and gold shops came out to buy with little strength, and the price once fell to 3,760 yuan. But ultimately, due to the tightness of the exchange rate market, gold shops turned to buying, and securities firms also came to search for goods, and the price rose to 3,855 yuan. Although gold shops came out again in the middle and slightly retraced, by the time of the noon close, it was 3,835 yuan. The afternoon opening price was comparable to the morning close. Later, because the pushers were not as enthusiastic as in the morning, and the Hong Kong merchants' appetite was also small, it fell back to 3,800 yuan. However, the closing price rose again to 3,822 yuan, a rebound of 57 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still brisk, with more than 2,000 taels traded. Silver jewelry also rose by 5 yuan. Customs gold and others remained flat.

Raw Gold Rebounded 57 Yuan

From the initial opening of each bar (ten taels) in the morning, due to the tightening of the foreign exchange, buying sentiment was stimulated. Securities firms first raised prices, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices. The market opened with a jump of 55 yuan. Securities firms entered 30 taels with money changers at 3,820 yuan. After the opening, jewelry shops and money changers suddenly came to frantically sell, and because the foreign exchange situation stabilized, the entering forces were weak and immediately retreated into the 3,800 yuan range. Money changers traded 20 taels mutually at 3,760 yuan. Subsequently, due to a certain order number pulling up, it rose by 40 yuan in an instant. Money changers entered 20 taels with gold shops at 3,800 yuan. After this, another gold shop came out on behalf of a large household, and then retreated to 3,760 yuan. Then, a certain gold shop continued to buy on behalf of speculators, and securities firms came to search for goods again, coupled with the softening of the foreign exchange, resulting in a surge of 95 yuan. A certain gold shop entered 30 taels with money changers, priced at 3,855 yuan. Near noon, a certain gold shop suddenly profited and came out again, and money changers also followed suit and sold. Soon after, it fell back by 30 yuan. Money changers sold 50 taels to gold shops, priced at 3,825 yuan. Later, a certain silver building entered 20 taels with money changers, with a noon closing price of 3,835 yuan. The initial opening in the afternoon was still stable. First, a certain silver building entered 50 taels with money changers, priced at 3,835 yuan. After that, although a certain silver building continued to purchase on behalf of Hong Kong merchants, the amount was limited, and a certain gold shop and retail investors had a strong selling atmosphere, which actually shrank by 35 yuan. Gold shops traded 30 taels mutually, priced at 3,800 yuan. After entering, a certain money changer took advantage of the low price to absorb funds, and Hong Kong merchants came back to activity, which pulled up by 25 yuan. Money changers bought 20 taels from order numbers at 3,820 yuan. Then, money changers traded 30 taels mutually, with a closing price of 3,822 yuan. As a result, it rebounded by 575 compared to the previous day, with a total of 95 yuan in ups and downs. The selling price of the current cash gold number's brand gold is 10 yuan higher than raw gold, and the purchase price must be reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current standard gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, but there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Listed at 5 Yuan Higher

The initial price for silver jewelry sold by each tael of Dahonghang was still $380. At 11:15 AM, the price was listed 5 yuan higher. After that, there were no further changes. Dahonghang changed the listed price to $385. Xinhonghang's price was the same as the above price, and the purchase price must be reduced by 15 yuan to 20 yuan, or more.

### Foreign Currencies Turn Firm

British and American Gold Pounds Rise by One Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a decrease in the supply of British and American gold pounds, and the market was firm. Customers were eager to absorb British and American gold bills, and the price rose significantly. Hong Kong bills followed suit and became expensive due to the firming of the Hong Kong exchange rate. The demand for French franc bills and Annam bills increased, and the price also rose. Philippine bills and Australian gold bills also rose with British and American gold bills. The market for Japanese gold bills was slightly firm, with an evening price of one yuan, three cents, and two and a half mills. The demand for Korean bills increased slightly, and the market was slightly firm, with an evening price of one yuan and nine and a half mills.

### Securities Market Stagnant

Yesterday's black market trend for securities turned soft again. On the surface, it fell by five to six corners, but it was actually similar to the closing price of the previous day, without much difference. It can be said that it was a large rise followed by a small retreat. Fundamentally, people's hearts are still stable, and there is no special pattern. When type C fell to eight and a half yuan, buyers were extremely enthusiastic, and the mentality of buying low had deeply affected the industry, creating a situation where it was easy to rise and difficult to fall. As the foreign exchange tightened slightly and gold rebounded, the multi-party's aggressive intentions were slightly relaxed. The news was dull, the rumors temporarily subsided, and the dynamics of the various factions gradually became calm. However, changes in the situation in the near future are said to have significant progress, so more and more people are paying attention to the government bond market, and there will be greater changes in the future. Yesterday's situation saw the morning start weak and then firm, with frequent entries and exits by various factions. Shengda Hongkang and others bought in, with the 20th being the most enthusiastic to absorb at a low price. Tongkang Tiansheng and No. 40 both sold, with Changji selling the most. The noon close was down five to six corners. The afternoon situation stabilized, and the various factions did little business. Although Changji continued to sell, the market price was quite firm. The market price resulted in a retreat of three and a half to six and a half corners, with only No. 96 being good by one and a half corners. The total turnover was about one million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Unified A | 58.70 | 58.60 | 58.60 | Down 0.60
Unified B | 50.60 | 50.25 | 50.60 | Down 0.35
Unified C | 48.75 | 48.50 | 48.75 | Down 0.60
Unified D | 48.55 | 48.35 | 48.55 | Down 0.45
Unified E | 48.95 | 48.70 | 48.90 | Down 0.65
96 | 5.95 | —— | 5.95 | Up 0.15

Stock trading saw 50 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company stock traded at a price of 29 yuan and 5 corners, it is said.

The stock market at the Public Assembly of Various Industries was slightly stagnant yesterday, probably because trading was only for half a day, so prices were roughly the same as before.

London, 24th Dispatch. Today's listed exchange rates for Chinese foreign debt remain calm. There were no changes in various government bonds, whether up or down. London, 24th Dispatch. Today, the listed exchange rates for various British companies in the Far East saw another rise. The share price of McCalee Bank rose by two shillings and six pence to seven pounds and seven shillings and six pence.

The share price of Currack Lim Bang Rubber shares rose by three pence to sixteen shillings and three pence. The rest were flat.

### Yarn and Cloth: Yarn Prices Rise Again, Both Double-Horse and Double-Earth Jump by Over 30 Yuan Each

The yarn market, which had been falling sharply every day, rebounded yesterday, and the rise was both violent and drastic. This kind of rebound and rise was also within reason. At the same time, the foreign exchange changed to shrink, and Hong Kong merchants had a slightly healthier appetite due to the cheap price, revealing a little vitality. The general snatchers competed to scoop up in the market, and the market tightened, the buying atmosphere was extremely strong, and the market price rose step by step. Market transactions, including the nature of winning and losing for the same industry, accounted for more than 70% of the transactions, entering and exiting from time to time. The future tea foundation is not consolidated. We must cultivate and plant it through actual sales. We will find it difficult to exist in the midst of turbulence and uncertainty. Because the bottom has seen an increase, relying solely on the pull-up of hoarders and speculators is not a fundamental problem.

The opening price of the current yarn in the morning was solid due to the lingering style of the previous day. The opening price was still flat. Soon after, it was heard that the foreign exchange had suddenly shrunk, and the popularity immediately stirred up. Speculators rose up again, the buying atmosphere suddenly ignited, the shouting was loud, and the market price rose step by step. The spot price of 20s Double Horse rose from 626 yuan all the way to 656 yuan at the close of trading. The price increase of other brands was more moderate. According to the half-day transaction statistics, there were 2,030 packages traded. The market price of 10s Double Horse rose by 34 yuan, Tiannv rose by 34 yuan, and Double Earth rose by 36 yuan. The factory of Yong'an Factory opened 400 packages of 20s Special Jincheng, priced at 650 yuan to 660 yuan. It was found that there were four pieces of cotton yarn being shipped to Hong Kong today (26th), and 350 pieces being shipped to Ningbo. The amount of each party's purchases is listed on the left:

Same Industry 1,360 Ningbo 110
Hong Kong 41 Mainland 150
Total 2,030

The Yarn Industry Association will move to the second floor of the eastern part of the New World Building at the Racecourse on Daimalu starting from next month, which is November 1st, and will conduct business meetings as usual. The original location has expired.

### Raw Cotton Falls to 120 Yuan

The trading of the same cotton industry has become more lively, but the factory side is still waiting and watching the purchasing mind because the yarn price fluctuates. All transactions are buying and selling in the cotton number. The price of raw cotton Huoji Flower fell by one or two yuan. As for the Tongzhou Flower with superior quality, the selling price is still flat, but the goods with inferior silk and wool are still loose. It was found that 975 packages of Tong Flower came from Subei, 1,348 packages came from Changyinsha, and 454 packages came from Beisha. The current cotton selling dishes are listed on the left (banknote stack delivery):

Huoji Flower 120.00 Same Industry 200 Packages
Again 121.00 Again 150 Packages
Brazilian Cotton 183.00 Again 60 Pieces
Again 176.50 Again 100 Pieces
Tongzhou Flower 127.50 Again 240 Packages
Again 126.50 Again 400 Packages
Huoji Flower 121.00 23.00 Again 1,000 Packages
Tongzhou Morning 130.00 Again 120 Packages

Another message: The transaction of Shanghai's foreign cotton has been sluggish recently due to the sharp release of exchange rates, and the yarn price has plummeted. The same industry is holding a wait-and-see attitude. The factory side has been closed for a long time. Those in the same industry who have hand goods have suffered losses due to the impact of the exchange rate. Although the exchange rate has turned tight yesterday, the cotton price has not been able to rise, so all parties' minds are unusually indifferent. Cotton merchants believe that the rise and fall of the cotton price depends entirely on cotton yarn, but yarn merchants say that it must be determined by the rise and fall of the cotton price. But in fact, the rise and fall of commodity prices depends entirely on the level of the exchange rate.

Foreign cotton market price: New York cotton market was firm in the early morning, and the market was very outstanding due to the purchase of speculators and the prosperity of spot transactions. The Liverpool telegram was good, so there were many transactions in the same industry. As a result, the closing price rose by four or five pounds compared to the previous day. India was flat, Egypt rose by more than ten pounds, and Liverpool rose by four pounds.

### Grains: Rice Sources are Smoother

Yesterday's sources from various gangs: Hexia had no arrivals. Chelun Baozi arrived at more than 4,000 packages. The arrival was huge, and the market had softened yesterday, so the early market started, people's hearts were frivolous, and the Hakka selling heart was loose. Later, the two local stomachs were also flat, and the situation became more loose, and the market could hardly stand firm. As a result, the number of transactions in the city was only five or six thousand packages, and the prices of new japonica rice and kiln-grown Baige, etc., fell by half a yuan to nearly one yuan compared with the previous market. The remaining broken japonica, Yuan and Luyang Jiankejian fell by about half a yuan. The closing market price of Changxi Gaoxin japonica rice was 31 yuan, 120 yuan and 5 cents, and the second was 26 to 27 yuan. The market broken japonica was 30 yuan to 289 yuan, 26 to 27 yuan. Sutung Kunchang new japonica was 29 and a half yuan, 29 yuan, and the second was 26 yuan, broken 25 to 26 yuan, Qingjiao Kiln seed 30 yuan and 5 cents, wild rice 31 yuan, 30 yuan and 5 cents, Fengjia Baige 29 yuan, and the second was 27 and a half yuan, Songjiang second Baige 26 and a half yuan, thin broken 26 yuan, Nangang white rice 29 yuan, early broken 25 yuan, 23 yuan and 23 cents for special sheep tips, 20 yuan and 8 cents for the end, 24 yuan for special Lu tips, 22 yuan and a half for the end, and Jiangbei tips have been difficult to communicate with the market price in the producing area and the problem of shipping obstacles, so there have been no arrivals for a long time. The market is only receiving a limited amount of old deposits, so even though Wujian has fallen between the falls, most cargo owners are unwilling to get rid of it lightly and insist on trying their best. At the same time, sales are welcomed and managed, so the closing price is slightly affected by Wujian and is slightly criticized by two or three cents, doing 19 yuan, seven corners and 19 and a half yuan, and its Nanjing No. 1 is open at 19 yuan and eight corners, No. 2 is 19 yuan and three corners, Zaihao is 18 yuan and eight corners, Wuhu Dujian is 19 yuan and eight corners, and it ends at sharp 18 yuan, Chen Bianyuan 30 yuan, 29 yuan, and Xin Yuan 26 and a half yuan to 25 yuan.

Yesterday's market for Ke Xian was sold in detail, and the market continued to fall. In addition to the small number of arrivals from Jiangbei, the area of Jingwu continued to arrive in whole batches. It is said that the price of Wuhu has been reduced, and the price of Changdi machine rice has been reduced to 11 yuan. It seems that the source will not be reduced in the future. Although Dongxing lacks wholesale spitting out, there are still small sales in retail, and the stock of rice in this city is increasing, people's hearts are softening, and the market price has been cut by three to five cents. The total market transaction is less than 3,000 packages.

### Artillery Car Powder: The Customer Plate Opens at 7 and a Half Yuan

Flour: The spot flour was as stable as usual yesterday. Sales to customers from the north and south oceans can be described as consecutive. There are sporadic additions in Tianjin and Hong Kong and Xiamen, but the number is not strong. The factory is also unwilling to supply as much as possible. The wholesale price of No. 2 flour is still 7 yuan and 3 cents. The customer plates such as the Bingchuan Tianzhu and other powders are 7 yuan and 4 corners, and the Artillery Car brand has been opened at 7 yuan and 5 corners. The market is still stable, and the total market transaction is 40,000 packages.

Wheat: There were not many sources yesterday, and sales were not strong. Because the foreign exchange was lengthened the day before and the gold market plummeted, the ocean wheat orders may be close, so the factory took advantage of this opportunity to choose cleverly, and the cargo party was still unwilling to accommodate too much because of the high cost. As a result, the market continued to rise by one or two corners. The total market was 800 packages of Jiangbei and Suzhou wheat imported by Fuxin Factory, priced at 10 yuan, 6 cents to 4 cents and a half. The Guohu purchased 14 vehicles of Changzhou and Kunshan wheat, priced at 10 yuan, 8 cents and 3 cents to 6 cents.

### Oil Cake: Raw Soybean Oil: Arrivals Connect: Market Dips

Yesterday's raw soybean oil market generally turned down, mainly because the sources were connected, and the gangs were not greedy, so people's hearts were set, and the market was lazy. Peanut oil fell by one and a half yuan, and soybean oil fell by half a yuan to one yuan. A total of 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were opened, priced at 58 yuan, and 750 cans of Jiangbei canned raw oil were opened, priced at 73 yuan, all of which were taken by Hong Kong. The street only sold 25 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, priced at 68 yuan, 50 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, 50 yuan and 5 cents, 100 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, 50 yuan, and 100 cans of Jiangbei canned soybean oil, 64 yuan and 5 cents.

Today, 230 packages of beans were shipped to Hong Kong, 300 packages were shipped to Singapore, and 3,200 pieces of bean cake were shipped to Singapore.

### Silk and Tea: Bai Factory Jing Suddenly Drops by 400 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign silk market: Japanese and American silk prices both rose and fell. New York's recent fall was one corner and five mills, and the forward rose by one cent. Yokohama's spot fell by 10 yuan, and the forward fell by 35 yuan. Foreign firms stopped entering their stomachs. The eating price of 70-80% of Bai Factory was 4,300 yuan, which was a huge drop of 400 yuan compared to the 4,700 yuan last week. But at present, Shanghai's silk stock is thin, and most of the raw materials are still detained in Hongkou, so manufacturers have limited hand goods and are unwilling to accommodate. Yesterday, there were few transactions in Bai Factory Jili, and there were no imports or exports in Yinzhuang.

Today (26th), 10 pieces of tea leaves were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods: Transactions Resume

National Cloth

The recent decline of cotton cloth has been too fierce. The same industry and scattered hoarders have successively disposed of their goods. Compared with the beginning of this month, the market has been reduced by 4 yuan per piece of 10-pound coarse cloth, and fine twill and fine cloth also need 3 or 4 yuan. Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded, and people's hearts looked bullish. The street started to purchase, and the transaction suddenly became strong. The selling dishes in the morning market were still varied. In the afternoon, all the coarse cloth, fine cloth and twill were increased by one corner to two and a half corners per piece, and the colored cloth, colored twill and bleached cloth were increased by two and a half corners to five corners per piece. This street replenished empty positions and thoughts. The transaction of coarse cloth, fine cloth and fine twill was more than 500 pieces.

### Sugar Market: Although the Price of Foreign Sugar is Flat, the Shanghai Market is Still Good; There is a Saying that Chao Sugar will Increase Taxes

According to the Dutch telegram, the market price of gross white sugar just loaded is slightly flat, at 11.25 Dutch guilders, but the foreign exchange has shrunk, so the market price of the Guild Hall has also turned better.

Chen Glutinous Rice Branch Sees Rise: New glutinous rice branches are short of arrivals, but it has been found that there are about 70 boxes of Chen goods.

After the industry buys Huai, they will pick and choose it, or it will be sold for 230 yuan.

Small Tinplate Sells Clean: 90-pound small tinplate has been quiet in the market for a long time.

### Beef Juice: Truly a Great Tonic  Gu Mingdao

Those who use their brains extensively are generally weak and prone to illness. Therefore, it is essential to take tonics during the winter to strengthen their foundation and bodies. However, tonics like ginseng and deer velvet are either expensive or too rich. Although there are many imported products, they also have the drawback of focusing on one aspect while neglecting others. Furthermore, medications are used to correct imbalances and are not the ideal, regular tonic. Hence, there is a saying: "Food tonics are better than medicinal tonics." Among food tonics, besides eggs, beef has the greatest nourishing power. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" states that beef is sweet, warm, belongs to earth, calms the middle, strengthens the spleen, benefits qi, and quenches thirst. Scientific analysis reveals that it contains elements such as phosphorus, protein, and enzymes. Therefore, Westerners especially enjoy eating it. In the past, Chinese people often avoided it, believing it was difficult to digest, but now it is also considered a good dish. However, for weak individuals seeking ample nourishment, nothing is better than drinking its juice. It is highly effective, easily digestible, and truly has a hundred benefits without a single drawback. However, making it oneself daily can be troublesome and uneconomical. Now, Yuansha Company's beef juice is fresh, highly nourishing, and has been sterilized. Daily delivery is arranged with various conveniences for subscribers. Compared to crudely made, substandard products, it is on a different level altogether. It is truly a great and timely tonic for strengthening the body in winter.

### Recommended Tonic Zhao Junhao

Several years ago, due to excessive use of my brain, I often felt mentally inadequate. Friends and relatives advised me to take tonics, but I was unsure which tonic would be most suitable. Then, a Western friend mentioned the effectiveness of beef juice, which piqued my interest. However, the price of generally foreign-made beef juice was too high, making long-term consumption uneconomical. So, I switched to Yuansha Company's fresh beef juice and found that it not only tasted delicious but also had a nourishing power that was absolutely no less than that of imported products. Occasionally, I also took young chicken juice, which had even more remarkable effects. After taking it continuously for one or two months, both my physical and mental strength improved significantly. It is convenient to take, and the price is fair. It can be considered the best of the best among modern tonics. Therefore, at the end of this book, I am writing a short article to promote it! (Excerpted from Zhao Jun's "The Newspaper Industry in China")

### A Child Without Illness All Year Round Qin Shouou

My neighbor, Mr. Zou, is my old classmate and colleague. We have been neighbors on Avenue Foch for at least four or five years, so I know everything about him and his family very well. Even if I were to record everything like my "Leng Ziyu Narrating the Ningguo Prefecture," it would not be a problem. However, firstly, it might not be very interesting, and secondly, it seems too far from the scope of this article.

Now, let's just talk about his family of five. In addition to him and his wife, the other three are their sons. Mr. Zou is not yet forty years old and has raised three boys in one go, which is truly fortunate in the eyes of those who "struggle to have children." However, he certainly suffered for these three children three years ago! Because he is a refined, mentally exhausting person, and his wife only has "bone structure" and no "flesh," both husband and wife are very thin. Therefore, their sons were all "skin and bones," constantly catching colds and coughs, seeking medical attention, and even suffering from serious illnesses, causing chaos at home and unrest for the family. The couple often did not smile for a week, talking only about their three children's illnesses.

He had also noticed the famous saying "prevention is better than cure" and wanted to give his sons some nourishing food to strengthen their bodies and ward off illnesses. Initially, he listened to the Western doctors who had eaten Flag Brand bread and filtered water for many years and completely treated Chinese people as foreigners. He had his three children drink milk and cod liver oil regularly. Unfortunately, the milk was too rich and oily, and the cod liver oil was too fishy. After eating it for two or three months, the children's bodies did not improve, and their appetites worsened instead. Mr. Zou became anxious and sought Chinese medicine, switching to eating white fungus and bird's nest. After eating it for more than half a year, the amount of money spent was not small, but the effect was not seen at all. When he asked the old doctors, they all said that this was a "royal road" tonic, with long-term benefits but no immediate effects. When he asked when the long-term benefits would be seen, the old doctors could not say. Later, Mr. Zou almost gave ginseng to his children, but he thought it was not good after all, as he seemed to have never heard of children aged seven or eight or four or five eating ginseng in his thirty-plus years of life. So, he could only frown and sulk all day and night.

Coincidentally, one winter, I was subscribing to Yuansha Company's young chicken juice, and he chatted with me, planning to order three portions to try. Because I knew that his finances were not very affluent, I advised him to order three portions of beef juice first and let the children try it for a month. Unexpectedly, more than twenty days later, the three children, who originally had faces as yellow as withered wax, actually showed some redness. The second child, who used to wet the bed every night, also stopped doing so from then on. Mr. Zou was so happy that he let his three little brothers eat fresh beef juice throughout the winter. By the second year, Mrs. Zou's spirits were also much better. According to her, the three children averaged only one minor illness every three months, no longer as frail as before. So, they subscribed every year, almost without interruption except for the three or four months of summer. Until now, these three young Mr. Zous have become children without illness all year round.

The purpose of my writing this article is not purely to promote Yuansha Company. The main purpose is to tell everyone: Choosing tonics is really not an easy task!

### Equivalent to a "Fox-lined Robe" Dai

My cousin, Zhu Lianjun, is physically weak and afraid of the cold. In severe winter, he cannot keep warm without heavy fur clothing, which not only makes his movements clumsy but also makes work inconvenient. During the escape, he only had a lined jacket to cover his body. After arriving in Shanghai, renting a house and buying furniture consumed much of his finances. Although he still wore heavy fur clothing, he lacked the strength to carry on. Mrs. Zhu knew that Yuansha Beef Juice could nourish vitality and strengthen bones and muscles, so she bought it to add to his soup. Mr. Zhu only noticed that it tasted delicious and did not realize anything different. Severe winter had passed, and the New Year was approaching. One night, Mr. Zhu said to his wife, "In the past, I couldn't keep warm without heavy fur clothing, but tonight I don't feel cold even wearing a cotton robe. Is it because the weather in Shanghai is warmer?" Mrs. Zhu smiled. Mr. Zhu knew something was different and questioned her, finally getting the truth. He then sighed and said, "Now I know the real effect of Yuansha Company's beef juice. It is not only a good tonic but also equivalent to a fox-lined robe!" So, every day when the beef juice arrived, Mr. Zhu would say, "The fox-lined robe is here!"

### Children's Song Xu Zhuodai

The Tang family has a little brother, only seventeen years old.

Last year his health was not good, his face was yellow, and he was weak.

He only ate half a bowl of rice, and he was not interested in studying.

The doctor said he had consumption, and his parents were worried.

Fortunately, the kind neighbor next door said he should eat young chicken.

Eating it every day is too troublesome, killing and cooking chickens is too much work.

Using Yuansha Young Chicken Juice has a greater effect and is cheaper.

So, he bought it and ate it every day, and his illness disappeared immediately.

His body is strong, his face looks good, and he can run six or seven miles.

### "My Feet Are Ice Cold" Chen Lingxi

Yuansha Company is the only large company specializing in the production of beef juice and young chicken juice. The brand is old, the scale is large, and the reputation is resounding. I have long known about it. Many friends, because I am a mentally exhausting person with blood deficiency and a weak body, advise me to buy beef juice or young chicken juice. Several doctor friends are also recommending it, believing that it is the most effective and economical tonic in winter. Spending ten or eight dollars a month is like drinking a bottle of soda, but the effect is comparable to ginseng and deer velvet. However, I have never tried it. Because someone once told me that beef juice and the like are made from raw materials purchased from overseas. The raw material is like asphalt, bought in large barrels and sold in small bottles. So, I became somewhat distrustful and unwilling to try it.

Now, eating the Yuansha chicken giblets and chicken feet given to me by Mr. Chen Chengyuan of Yuansha Company has given me strong proof that Yuansha Company's products are genuine, using fresh chicken and beef, and extracting the juice using scientific methods. Therefore, from that time on, I continuously ate young chicken juice for three months.

How was the effect? I should also report a few words. I am a person with a weak body and many illnesses. There is no need to hide it. In winter, my wife always says that my body is not good and that I should eat some tonics. Why does she only know that my body is not good in winter? It's quite embarrassing and interesting to say. It turns out that when I go to bed and put my feet into the quilt, they always inevitably touch her. My feet are as cold as if they were fished out of cold water. This is because of the deficiency of both qi and blood. Sometimes she advises me to eat tonics, but sometimes she scolds me for having feet as cold as a dead person's. However, since taking Yuansha Young Chicken Juice, my feet have gradually become warm. Isn't this a definite proof of the great effect of Yuansha Young Chicken Juice?

This year, in order to avoid being scolded by my wife for having dead feet, I have started eating young chicken juice again. Last year, I went from eating chicken giblets and chicken feet to eating chicken juice. But I can't help but think of last year's chicken giblets and chicken feet. So, I have to drag on this not-so-glorious tail. This is precisely the corresponding method in writing techniques. I am not asking for chicken giblets and chicken feet to eat. If this article is seen by Mr. Chen Chengyuan, and he is careless and does not see my classical Chinese writing style, he will think that I am asking him for chicken giblets and chicken feet to eat. That would be a tragedy.

### Self-administered for Four Years: Great Effectiveness Physician Jiang Baozhen

The beef juice and young chicken juice produced by Yuansha Company are indeed highly effective. I have been taking beef juice for four years, and mentally, I feel more fulfilled than before. For friends and patients who need to take beef juice and young chicken juice, after introducing them to it, they also praised it in unison. The method of taking it is simple, and the taste is palatable, which is also a great thing.

### I Write Ms. Wang Xichun

Yuansha Company's beef juice and young chicken juice are my favorite year-round tonics. The taste is delicious, and the effect is great. It does have the power to nourish the body.

But although my wife and I are old, we have been taking fresh beef juice from Yuansha Company every day for the past six years without interruption.

(3) Strongman Sets Up a Ring

This strongman has been eating fresh beef juice from Yuansha Company since childhood for ten years. He is as strong as an ox. Even if the Ox Demon King were reborn, he would have to retreat. He once went to Niuzhuang and defeated fifty-four warriors. He also set up a ring in front of the Ox Head Temple on Ox Head Mountain, scaring away a group of braggart strongmen. This strongman has now arrived in Shanghai and invites Chinese and foreign experts to come and have a clear fight.

(4) Xie Mansion Announcement

At 7:00 PM on the third of this month, two bandits broke into our residence, intending to rob us. Fortunately, our master and others were out and had not returned. Only the fourth young lady was at home. Fortunately, the fourth young lady heard the alarm and jumped down from the upstairs, fighting with the bandits. One bandit saw that the situation was not good and fled through the back door. The other bandit was captured by the fourth young lady and sent to the authorities for investigation. Although the fourth young lady is only seventeen years old, because she usually takes fresh beef juice and fresh young chicken juice from Yuansha Company, her physical strength is particularly strong and can defeat a strong adult man.

(5) Chicken Skin Chicken Hair Talk

A: "I saw Yuansha Company's advertisement saying that regular consumption of 'Yuansha Young Chicken Juice' can strengthen the body and prolong life. I'm afraid it's not reliable."

B: "It's definitely true. Everyone knows that young chicken juice is nourishing."

A: "Then is there a way to prove it?"

B: "That's easy. In the past, people used chicken skin and chicken hair to describe healthy old people. If you don't eat chicken juice, where would you get chicken skin?"

### Dietary Dos and Don'ts for Typhoid Fever Chen Xiaoren

Post-illness nutrition with beef juice and young chicken juice is the most suitable.

*This table applies to those with fever lasting more than two weeks from damp-heat fever, autumn fever, spring fever, and winter fever.*

### Beverages During the Fever Period

(1) If the fever is mild and the person does not want to eat, they can be allowed to abstain from food. If they want to eat, they can eat "rice crust soup," also known as pot crust soup, rice scorch soup, or rice skin porridge. Only this soup can be eaten when there is fever. Do not let rice grains fall in. The best pot crust is the scorched and black one, as it helps the stomach qi and is easy to digest. Rice crust soup has nourishing power. This substance is a flowing liquid, which can nourish the body without stagnating in the intestines and stomach. It is the most precious tonic for typhoid fever.

(2) For damp-heat typhoid fever, coix seed tea (i.e., coix seed decoction, only drink the liquid) and roasted barley tea can also be taken. For summer-heat typhoid fever, lotus leaf tea, agastache tea, chrysanthemum tea, and Buddha's hand tea can also be drunk. It still needs to be administered according to the symptoms. First, seek the doctor's consent.

(3) Plain boiled water is the best beverage during typhoid fever. Frequent drinking is very beneficial for the consumption during fever. Recently, many patients have asked if they can drink orange juice. Although this can be drunk, it must be squeezed and drunk hot. The oranges must be large, plump, and sweet. Small, sour ones are not suitable for drinking.

(4) If the fever has been going on for a long time, and the fever gradually decreases, the person feels tired and thirsty for food, a thin arrowroot powder soup can be taken appropriately. (Genuine arrowroot powder must be used. If white arrowroot powder is used, it is mostly starch, water chestnut powder, or yam powder, which are not suitable.) Oatmeal soup (i.e., American oatmeal flakes, first stir-fried until scorched, then boiled into a thin soup) should be eaten with the principle of "hunger" in mind. Do not seek to be full.

(5) During the second stage of typhoid fever, when the fever is raging, snow water boiled tea, watermelon dew, and bamboo sap oil can be drunk according to the doctor's instructions. When the mouth is bitter, greasy, tasteless, green salt, aged tangerine peel, salted olives, and coptis root can be chewed. Change one type a day. Chew the juice and spit out the residue. This is of utmost importance.

(6) During the fever period of typhoid fever, drinking milk must be with the doctor's consent.

### The First to Fourth Days After the Fever Subsides

If the typhoid fever has completely subsided, it means that the inflammation in the intestines has subsided, and the digestive function is gradually becoming active. At this time, food is needed to supply consumption. The situation is significantly different from when the fever has not subsided. From the first to the fourth day after the fever has subsided, the diet must follow the following procedure.

There are about five types of food: (1) Rice crust porridge (2) Arrowroot powder (3) Oatmeal soup (4) Rice and wheat noodles (5) Cantonese can eat sweet osmanthus powder soup.

There are about six types of beverages: (1) Barley tea (2) Coix seed tea (3) Mulberry sprout tea (4) Black tea, green tea, plain boiled water (5) Tofu juice (6) Milk.

There are about six types of side dishes: (1) Sweet pickled melon (spit out the residue) (2) Yunnan large mustard tuber (spit out the residue) (3) Fermented bean curd (4) Jellyfish (5) Sesame paste (6) Tofu with green salt.

There are about five types of fruits: (1) Oranges (2) Xinhui oranges (3) Water chestnuts (4) Olives (5) Pears.

Regarding dishes, there are very few dishes that can be selected as side dishes within the first four days after the fever subsides. Because when the fever first subsides, the body needs food to replenish consumption. Moreover, after a long period of hunger, people are unusually greedy. After a long period of lying down, once the illness is initially relieved, eating is the only consumption and comfort. Therefore, everyone is eager for food. There is a crisis at this time, that is, because the digestive function after typhoid fever often does not return to normal, it cannot withstand stagnation. The stomach is strong, and the intestines are weak. Therefore, it is easiest to relapse. So, it is still necessary to abstain from food after illness. The above beverages can each be taken and replaced daily to change the taste. Other items should not be tried. Greasy, meaty, raw, cold, and wild foods are all taboo.

### The Fifth Day After the Fever Subsides

Regarding food, four more types can be added: (1) Bread slices. (2) Scorched rice porridge. (3) Winter frost rice porridge. (4) Thin rice porridge.

Regarding beverages, two more types can be added. (1) Fresh beef juice. (2) Fresh young chicken juice.

Regarding dishes, the following can be eaten: (1) Vegetable soup (2) Spinach and egg white soup. Shaoxing dried vegetable soup (3) Tomato soup (4) Egg flower soup (5) Duck soup (6) Chicken blood soup (7) Spinach and pork liver soup (8) Chicken soup (9) Luffa soup. Alternate regularly.

### The Tenth Day After the Fever Subsides

From the tenth day after the fever subsides, thicker rice porridge can be eaten. There are also items that can be eaten without taboo: (1) Winter melon (2) Gluten (3) Yam (4) Roasted ribs (5) Ham (6) Meat floss (7) Dried cabbage (8) Dried vegetable essence (9) Bamboo shoots (10) Mushrooms (11) Tofu skin (12) Tofu skin clothing (13) Macaroni (14) Flattish bamboo shoots (15) Mung bean sprouts (16) Preserved eggs (17) Salted egg whites (18) Radishes and various pickles. The above items are numerous and can be used by patients for replacement and selection. However, they should not be eaten too much after all. The number of times can be slightly more, but the amount should not be too much. Initially, the residue must be spat out. After a while, it can be chewed and eaten.

### Eating Problems

From the fifteenth day after the typhoid fever subsides, soft rice can be eaten. (Such as aged rice, winter frost rice, fragrant japonica rice, etc.) Wait until twenty days to a month later to return to normal. The dates mentioned should be adjusted according to the severity of the illness. Because porridge and rice are very important, this order must be followed. Eating rice too early can easily cause a relapse. At this time, avoid eating: (1) Cakes (2) Hard biscuits (3) Zongzi (4) Glutinous rice balls (5) Stewed beans (6) Chestnuts.

### Post-illness Recuperation Period

After illness, fluids that are rich in nutrition and easy to digest are the most suitable. Therefore, after typhoid fever, chicken juice and beef juice, although they are meat products, are actually indispensable miraculous tonics for nourishing the body.

Some patients believe that it is not advisable to eat meat or stimulating food immediately after illness. They mistakenly believe that chicken juice and beef juice are stimulating foods. Initially, they dare not eat them. In fact, this view is a big mistake. Typhoid fever is not a surgical disease. Post-illness dietary restrictions do not prohibit meat or chicken. At this time, fluid tonics are needed. Beef juice and chicken juice are the only suitable products. There is definitely no better or more effective food. Those who have been ill for a month need to drink beef juice and chicken juice for two months. Those who have been ill for a month and a half must drink the juice for three months to restore vitality, replenish physical strength, and increase qi and blood. This is all obvious.

Post-illness dietary restrictions do not distinguish between meat and vegetables. Those that are easy to digest and nourishing are not taboo, even if they are meat. Those that are easy to digest but not nourishing should not be eaten, even if they are vegetables. Moreover, the appetite is weak after illness. Tonics should not be taken immediately. Because tonics stagnate the stomach, excessive medication will cause problems. Nourishing the body will harm the body instead. Chicken juice and beef juice are nourishing but not greasy and taste extremely delicious. Not only are they liked by patients, but they also do not have the drawbacks of tonics. For those who are extremely weak and tired after illness, "tonifying medicine prescriptions" must be separated by a month or until the winter season of the year before they can be taken.

### Resolving the Shanghai West Dispute: The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Drafts an Outline as a Basic Plan for Negotiations; British Troops Intensify Defenses in Shanghai West

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office issued a press release last night stating, "The Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, along with the Head of the Police Department, Major Bowen, are discussing several proposed outlines to be presented to Fu Xiao'an, the 'Mayor of the Special Municipality,' within a day or two, as a basic plan to resolve the dispute between the Municipal Council and the City Government." According to the aforementioned press release, regarding the dispute over road construction beyond the boundaries, since the evening of the 23rd, when the leading consul, Lieutenant Colonel Naroni, the Italian Consul-General in Shanghai, invited both parties, with the participation of the Japanese Consul, to mediate, the deadlock has been broken. What can be noted from now on is what kind of basic plan the SMC will rely on to resolve the dispute with this internationally unrecognized "Special Municipality." The following is a record of the developments yesterday:

Basic Principles Agreed Upon by Both Parties

The meeting between Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, and the pseudo-"Mayor" Fu Xiao'an on the 23rd took place at 5:00 PM at the pseudo-municipal government in the "Central District." Rumors that it was held at Fu's private residence were incorrect. Those present included the leading consul, Italian Consul-General Lieutenant Colonel Naroni, and Japanese Consul-General Miura Yoshiaki. Based on the pseudo-"Municipal Government's" demands regarding road construction beyond the boundaries, Mr. Fessenden proposed three basic principles, one of which was that the management rights of road construction beyond the boundaries would be exercised by a "Joint Management Bureau" jointly formed by the SMC and the pseudo-"Municipal Government" (similar to the principles agreed upon by Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun and Mr. Fessenden) to resolve the dispute. Although the parties present did not fully agree with this suggestion, they paid considerable attention to it.

Drafting a Plan for Negotiations

With the basic principles largely determined by both parties, the negotiations, which had fallen into a deadlock, are expected to resume. Yesterday, Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the SMC, together with Mr. Bowen, Chief of the SMC Police, began drafting a resolution plan based on the results of the talks between Fessenden and Fu Xiao'an. It is reported that it will be drafted within the next few days and sent to Fu Xiao'an as a basis for discussion between the SMC and the pseudo-"Municipal Government."

Establishing a Management Bureau as a Transition

According to reliable foreign sources, the SMC's proposal to establish a "Joint Management Bureau" to resolve all disputes over road construction beyond the boundaries has a high probability of being realized. However, this joint body is only a product of the transition period to quickly end all previous states of unrest. After the establishment of the "Joint Management Bureau," the second step of work will immediately proceed, with the SMC and the pseudo-"Municipal Government" dividing the management rights of road construction beyond the boundaries, that is, transferring all management rights of a certain part of road construction beyond the boundaries to the pseudo-"Municipal Government," while the SMC retains the rights and interests of the remaining roads. When the SMC abandons a portion of road construction beyond the boundaries, the SMC will simultaneously seek compensation from the pseudo-"Municipal Government" for the expenses incurred by the SMC in the past for land acquisition, road construction, road maintenance, drainage pipes, engineering, etc., for road construction beyond the boundaries, as well as the investments made by public utility companies in the area. The pseudo-"Municipal Government" has already indicated at the beginning of the negotiations on road construction beyond the boundaries that the expenses of the SMC and public utility companies in the area can be compensated. Therefore, it is generally believed that the main views of both parties have become similar, and the results of the recent talks are said to be good. Therefore, it is believed that the long-standing dispute will be resolved in the short term.

SMC Discusses Proposed Outlines

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reported, "This morning (the 25th), reliable sources said that after Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, held talks with Fu Xiao'an at his residence on Sunday night, accompanied by Italian Consul-General Nilon and Japanese Consul Miura, Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the SMC, and Mr. Bowen, Head of the Police Department, are now drafting several rough proposals to be submitted to Fu Xiao'an within a day or two as a basis for resolving the dispute between the two parties. Thus, the long-standing issue of roads outside the Shanghai boundary is taking a major step towards understanding and normalcy." It is heard that the detailed plans currently being drafted by Fessenden and Bowen are not yet complete, but it is generally believed that the main purpose of the proposals is to seek the greatest possible understanding of the proposals previously put forward by the "Special Municipality of Shanghai" regarding the issue of roads outside the boundary.

Jurisdiction over Roads Must Be Divided

Over the past week, reporters have made private inquiries to officials of the SMC and the "Municipal Government." Several of them believe that the entire incident can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. It is also heard that the SMC and the "Municipal Government" authorities, during consultations, proposed a joint management of the area of roads outside the boundary by the SMC and the "Municipal Government" police stations. However, according to the views expressed by the officials, while the possibility of joint management by both parties is commendable, it is not expected to be possible. Several officials also firmly believe that joint management of roads outside the boundary (including tax collection, etc.) will likely be quite short-lived. The general feeling is that after this initial agreement, the division of jurisdiction over the roads will be drafted. It is said that this means that several roads will be completely controlled by the "Special Municipality," while other roads will be managed by the SMC.

Pseudo-Government Compensates Municipal Expenses

It is generally believed that after an agreement is reached on these or similar conditions, the SMC will submit a "bill of expenses" to the "Municipal Government" for the roads outside the boundary transferred to the management of the "Special Municipality." This "expense" may include the construction costs of "returning" the roads. The "Municipal Government" will compensate for the funds spent on drainage and land acquisition, as well as the expenses incurred by various public convenience companies in the area. When Fu Xiao'an initiated negotiations, he proposed that all expenses of the SMC and public convenience companies in the area of roads outside the boundary should be compensated. Since the "Municipal Government" holds this attitude, well-informed sources claimed this morning that direct negotiations between the two parties will begin soon, and it is hoped that hopeful results and full understanding will be achieved, and all difficulties in fully resolving the long-standing dispute will be resolved.

British Troops Deployed for Contingencies

The intersections of Yidingpan Road, Yu Yuan Road, and Yidingpan Road, Da Xi Road in the area of road construction beyond the boundary are equipped with red and green traffic lights, which are managed by the SMC police. The pseudo-police have repeatedly tried to seize them, but have not succeeded. Since the assault on the patrolmen at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yu Yuan Road on the 20th, in order to strengthen defenses, the police have been dispatching Chinese and foreign detectives to be stationed at the two locations in the past few days. At the same time, British defense forces have also been deployed and built sandcastles at both locations. A small sandcastle had previously been added at the southeast corner of Yidingpan Road and Yu Yuan Road. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the sandcastle at the southwest corner of Yidingpan Road and Da Xi Road was dismantled and rebuilt on the sidewalk at the northwest corner. The inside and outside of the sandcastle are nailed with wooden boards, and the top is covered with a wooden shed. All the engineering is stronger than the original construction. It is understood that the British defense forces at the two locations, in addition to a portion stationed at the corners, another portion is stationed in borrowed civilian houses, ready to be dispatched at any time. In the future, the defense of the two locations will be safe. The situation in the Caogangdu area has been calm in recent days, and order has been restored to the state before the incident.

Japanese Spokesperson Advocates for the Pseudo-Regime

The spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at the press conference last night, "The main views on the issue of road construction beyond the boundary in Shanghai West have been agreed upon by the SMC and the 'Special Municipality,' so a final friendly resolution can be expected. When the two parties met on the 23rd, the SMC recognized the 'Special Municipality's' claimed sovereignty over road construction beyond the boundary. Since there is no dispute over the point of sovereignty, it is believed that the SMC will automatically hand over the taxation and management rights of road construction beyond the boundary to the 'Special Municipality.' Now that the main views are the same, the only remaining issues to be discussed are the SMC's recovery of investment in road construction beyond the boundary, and how to properly maintain security and order in the area." When asked what kind of taxes the pseudo-"Municipal Government" is currently collecting in the area, the spokesperson immediately denied that the pseudo-"Municipal Government" is currently collecting taxes in the area, and said, "All taxes are currently collected by the SMC, but this does not mean that the SMC has the legal right to collect taxes in the area. However, the SMC has established various public utilities in the area, so it should be compensated. As for the SMC's investment in the area, the 'Special Municipality' has also recognized it, so there is no dispute on this point between the two parties." When asked about the rumors that the SMC and the pseudo-"Municipal Government" will jointly form a "Joint Management Bureau" to govern road construction beyond the boundary, the spokesperson replied, "I have not heard of it. When Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, visited 'Mayor' Fu Xiao'an, it is understood that he brought three plans, but did not submit any of the plans to the 'Mayor,' so at this time, there is no answer to this point."

### The Four Lines Isolated Army's Heroic Battle: Today Marks the Second Anniversary; Regiment Commander Xie is Scheduled to Lead All Officers and Soldiers in a Commemoration at 3:00 PM Today

Today is the glorious second anniversary of the Four Lines Isolated Army's heroic battle that began at the Four Lines Warehouse in Zhabei. On October 26th of the year before last, after the Chinese army withdrew from Zhabei, the Four Lines Isolated Army defended the Four Lines Warehouse on Suzhou Road and began a heroic and magnificent battle. At that time, the residents of the concession, along the Suzhou River, admired the only shining national emblem on the Four Lines Warehouse, and everyone was moved to tears. The spirit of loyalty and righteousness was enough to shock the heavens and move the ghosts and gods, unfolding one of the most glorious pages in the history of the Chinese army's resistance against Japan. Even the friendly countries of Europe and the United States were amazed. The isolated army resisted for seven days. Then, the authorities of Shanghai and other countries, because the Four Lines Warehouse was adjacent to the concession and the shells were flying around, affecting the security and order of the concession, were compelled to urge the highest authorities of the Chinese army to order the withdrawal. Currently, all 400 officers and soldiers of the regiment are still staying in the barracks on Jiaozhou Road, working hard on health exercises and military training. Their determination to serve the country has not been released. It is now known that all officers and soldiers of the regiment will hold a grand commemoration and dinner today at 3:00 PM under the leadership of Regiment Commander Xie, as today is the second anniversary of the Four Lines Resistance.

American Diplomatic Agencies

Consolidated Office

All Moved into Construction Building; American Commercial Department Also Moved

The Continental News reports that the first result of the reorganization of American diplomatic agencies here will be seen, as the Office of the American Commercial Attaché in China, the Office of the American Agricultural Commissioner, and the Company Registry are scheduled to move to the new address on the third floor of the Construction Building at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road on October 30th. These three offices, under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of State, have been united with the U.S. Consulate General to implement President Roosevelt's "Reorganization Plan No. 2," which is expected to eliminate duplication of government office work. After the three offices begin working at the new address early next week, most of the U.S. offices in Shanghai will be concentrated. The seventh and eighth floors of the Construction Building are the U.S. Naval Procurement Office, the sixth floor is the U.S. Court for China, and the fourth and fifth floors are the U.S. Consulate General. The U.S. Company Registrar in China is Ms. Smith, the Commercial Counselor is Mr. An Lide, and the Agricultural Commissioner Tao Sen is scheduled to return to Shanghai in December.

In addition, according to a letter from the American Commercial Department in China and the Company Registry, from October 30th (Sunday), they will move to the third floor of the Construction Building at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road (i.e., downstairs from the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai) for office work.

### Shanghai-Hangzhou Passenger Train Destroyed by Landmine Again: Train Derails Between Chang'an and Xiaoshi After Hitting Landmine; More Than a Dozen Japanese Soldiers and Passengers Killed and Injured

Hua Dong News reports that, according to passengers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, less than half a month after several flower cars carrying Japanese and puppet military officers were bombed and destroyed by guerrillas between Chang'an and Xiaoshi on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and dozens of officers and soldiers were killed, an incident of vehicles hitting landmines and being bombed continued to occur between Xiaoshi and Chang'an on the morning of the 24th. Moreover, the situation of this bombing was more violent than the last time. The last train from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the 23rd usually runs to Jiaxing for the night and then departs from Jiaxing to Hangzhou the next morning (i.e., the 24th). Unexpectedly, the train hit a landmine about five or six kilometers away from Chang'an Station after passing Xiaoshi, destroying 12 vehicles on the spot and completely destroying the locomotive. It is also heard that the scope of this bombing was wider than the last time, and the damaged rails were about one kilometer long. In addition, several freight cars were attached to the passenger train, which were full of pigs, and all were bombed to death. In addition, more than a dozen Japanese mechanics and Japanese soldiers were killed and injured, and dozens of passengers were also killed and injured. According to a merchant from Hangzhou to Shanghai yesterday, I (the merchant claimed himself) happened to take the early train from Hangzhou to Shanghai on the morning of the 24th. Unexpectedly, the train could not move when it reached Xucun. According to people at the station, vehicles were bombed by landmines again between Chang'an and Xiaoshi, and there was a fear of a guerrilla attack. The Japanese troops stationed at the station first deployed defenses on the train and slowly moved forward. When the train arrived at Chang'an Station, the Japanese troops disembarked first and set up sentries at the bombed site to implement a cordon. Then, the passengers carried bags and suitcases and disembarked one after another, walked about two li, and then boarded a passenger train that had been parked on the track in advance and drove to Shanghai again. The early passenger train from Hangzhou to Shanghai usually arrives in Shanghai at 12:00 noon. Because of this, the train arrived at the North Station as late as 7:00 PM. It is said that the vehicles destroyed this time were almost completely destroyed, and the blood and flesh were blurred, which was too horrible to bear. The damaged rails are very long, and it is feared that it will be difficult to repair them completely in a short time, and the journey is very painful and extremely risky.

### Yao Youlian's Troops in Shanghai West Engaged in Fierce Battle with Japanese Troops: Five Japanese Soldiers Killed and Two Captured; Puppet Troops in Caojing Repeatedly Attempted to Revolt

According to a person from Shanghai West, Yao Youlian's troops of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army were originally stationed in Chengjiaqiao, Shanghai West. Yesterday afternoon (the 21st) at 1:00 PM, a fierce guerrilla battle broke out. It is understood that the team there is led by Team Leader Wang, with strong strength, known as Yao's elite. On the morning of the same day, Team Leader Wang learned from a secret report that the Japanese army was coming, and immediately ordered preparations. At about 1:00 PM, a team of Japanese troops arrived at Chengjiaqiao, carrying several light and heavy machine guns. The situation was very tense for a while. Team Leader Wang took the lead and gave a strong resistance. Suddenly, gunfire was heard all around, and the two sides fought fiercely. In this battle, five Japanese soldiers were killed and two were captured. They have now been sent to headquarters for disposal. The residents there are also afraid that the Japanese army will come back to vent their anger, and have all moved away. It is heard that Yao's troops recently received an order from their superiors to expand the organization and strengthen their strength. After receiving the order, Yao strengthened training and spared no effort, while thoroughly reforming the internal staff. According to Yao's recent statement, what is most painful is that the friendly troops cannot deeply understand, resulting in various misunderstandings in the past. In the future, he hopes that the friendly troops can understand the great purpose of saving the country and work together. In addition, in the Caohejing town, Shanghai West, the "Bandit Suppression Team" of three or four hundred men under Han Jun, who were originally stationed in the Second Prison, have recently repeatedly tried to take the opportunity to revolt due to the deep understanding of righteousness by the officers and soldiers of the team. The Japanese side sent a team to be stationed in the Caoxi Road Caojia Ancestral Hall and the Yumingxiqin Institute of the Guanshengyuan Biscuit Factory in the town, with about two hundred people.

### Improvement in Foreign Trade: Sharp Reduction in Excess of Imports

Excess of Imports Reduced by More Than 20 Million: Smallest Figure This Year

In September, due to the outbreak of the European War, imports of foreign goods fell sharply as never before. Exports of local goods were less affected due to the smooth sales to the United States. According to the trade figures released by the Customs yesterday, the net value of imports of foreign goods nationwide in September was 93,781,043 yuan in national currency, and the net value of exports of local goods was 85,424,738 yuan in national currency. The excess of imports was 8,756,305 yuan, a decrease of 36,600,970 yuan in imports compared with August, a decrease of 15,443,003 yuan in exports, and a decrease of 20,766,967 yuan in the excess of imports. The figure for the excess of imports in September is the smallest this year, which proves that China's trade has improved.

### U.S. Asiatic Fleet to Commemorate Navy Day Tomorrow: Will Not Change Past Attitudes Due to the European War; Augusta to Host American僑民

The development of the United States Navy, now second only to the United Kingdom, and its strength ranking above the navies of all countries in the world, should be attributed to the late President Theodore Roosevelt, who was in office from 1901 to 1909. Therefore, the U.S. Navy authorities have designated his birthday, October 27, as U.S. Navy Day. When the late President Roosevelt was in office, he spared no effort to expand the navy and completed the "Great White Fleet." Today, as World War II is in full swing in Central Europe, the American people attach greater significance to the commemoration this year. Even though the U.S. Navy will issue new regulations prohibiting the disclosure of news about naval operations in order to prevent espionage activities, it is generally believed that the U.S. Navy will still hold a grand commemoration ceremony in accordance with traditional attitudes, and invite all American侨民 in Shanghai to "board a U.S. warship and visit your navy." The flagship Augusta of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, commanded by Admiral Heard, is scheduled to be open for inspection within the specified time tomorrow for all local American侨民 to board and visit. Admiral Heard has not issued any contrary orders to date. Yesterday, the U.S. warships anchored on the Huangpu River and outside the Wusongkou were all flying the national flag, fluttering in the air. According to last year, the U.S. Navy Department held a large-scale commemorative ceremony as usual. The U.S. Navy Grand Marshal spoke to the American public nationwide via radio in Washington, as well as to the Commander of the 16th U.S. Naval Detachment in the Philippines, the Commander of the Mediterranean Patrol Fleet, and so on, informing them of future plans and the significance of the commemoration. The U.S. Navy's plans and budget for this year will build more battleships, destroyers, and cruisers. The next Congress will increase the naval budget to an unprecedented level, exceeding the "Wilson Proposal" signed and approved by the current U.S. President Roosevelt last year. Other air force budget proposals have also been submitted to Congress to cope with this dramatic change.

Various Sectors Appeal

to Cancel the Order for Tribute Rice

After entrusting the Shanghai Accountants Association to handle the registration of ordering Saigon ocean rice, about 100 companies went to register, totaling more than 15,700 bags of ocean rice to be ordered. At the end of September, due to the Saigon authorities' prohibition of rice exports, all rice buyers were notified to postpone the process. Now, the Shanghai rice price has gradually declined, and the citizens' worries have been eliminated. Therefore, the purchasers who have already registered have applied for cancellation one after another. It is heard that the joint ordering of ocean rice will be terminated on a regular basis.

Four Banks Loan Committee

Loan Balance Approximately

17.7 Million Yuan

The loan balance of the Shanghai Loan Committee of the four banks of Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China in August is estimated to be 17.7 million yuan. Among them, the balance directly loaned by the committee is about 16 million yuan, accounting for about 90%. The amount transferred by the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks accounts for about 6.24%, and the amount transferred by the Joint Reserve Depository of the Money Industry accounts for about 3.32%.

### Large Batch of Outstanding Chinese Children Transported to Tokyo Yesterday

Some outstanding orphans in our occupied areas are now considered by the Japanese side as rare commodities and have been collected. It is learned that a large number of boys and girls have been taken in by the Japanese Shanghai Buddhist Association and the Sino-Japanese Religious Great Alliance, and 22 outstanding boys and girls have been selected and transported to Japan, where they will be educated. The children were sent to the Nagasaki Maru by the Japanese side yesterday to leave Shanghai for Tokyo. (She Wen She)

### Situation in Jia District North of Suzhou River Gradually Returning to Quiet: British Troops and Chinese Police Patrol and Stationed as Usual; Japanese Troops Prevent Trade Across Barbed Wire Fence

Since the change in the defense zone of the Jia district north of Suzhou River by British and Japanese troops, the shops west of North Jiangxi Road have been completely blocked by barbed wire and obstacles, cutting off normal traffic. All sales and purchases must be made with a permit before being allowed to enter through the two gaps and detour. As a result, eight or nine out of ten shops have been closed, and the cityscape is extremely desolate. A reporter from Da Guang She patrolled the area yesterday and saw that several shops were forced to put all their wealth on sale or solicit top tenants. There were also three or four rice shops that revealed that they had a pass to enter the rice and sell goods. They greeted rice buyers outside the barbed wire fence, but said they could not negotiate. According to a merchant, after the obstacles were set up, the shops could still deliver goods as usual through the barbed wire fence, but after the Japanese troops discovered this, they beat them up and forbade them from accepting sales and purchases across the barbed wire fence. The shops were afraid of the power of the Japanese troops, so they had to endure the pain and close down. The Japanese troops repaired the barbed wire fence blocked by the Japanese troops at the target road intersection at the bottom of North Jiangxi Road because several places were damaged. Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, four Japanese troops carried iron hammers, iron cones, and other objects, led by an officer, and repaired the area. It took more than an hour to complete the work.

Police Officers Patrol as Usual

According to a reporter from Da Tong She who inspected the area between North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road yesterday morning, the situation was quite calm. The patrol of the Japanese troops in the area was also significantly reduced, while the Chinese police of the Huishi Police Station patrolled the various sections of the area as usual. Various vehicles in the guarded sections west of North Jiangxi Road and east of North Henan Road still passed without obstruction. However, only rickshaws and sedan cars were allowed to enter and exit the gaps in the barbed wire fence set up in North Jiangxi Road. Other vehicles were prohibited from traveling back and forth.

No Harsh Treatment in Residential Areas

The household registration in the various sections of the area has not been forcibly implemented to date. The situation in the area is different from that in Hongkou. It seems that the Japanese side will not arbitrarily impose various harsh policies. Therefore, for the shops or households currently living in the area, there is still no significant inconvenience or restriction.

British Troops Stationed at North Henan Road

The British troops at the barbed wire gate and in the bunker at the bottom of North Henan Road are still stationed as usual. A British soldier is stationed at the Qianjiang Guild Hall gate post at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road. Opposite the gate is a Chinese police officer guarding the sentry box. The intersections of North Henan Road, Tiantong Road, and North Suzhou Road are also guarded by Chinese police officers.

### Registration Procedures for Export Settlement Goods: Those Transported to Hong Kong Must Register with Fu Hua; Re-export of Transit Goods Requires a Duplicate Certificate

The Trade Committee under the Ministry of Finance has formulated registration procedures for export settlement goods. (1) Any merchant who transports export settlement goods to Hong Kong for sale must register with Fu Hua Company in Hong Kong upon arrival in Hong Kong. The registration agency for export goods that are not transported through Hong Kong for sale will be designated by the Trade Committee at any time. (2) When a merchant registers with Fu Hua Company or other designated agency, they must submit a purchase foreign exchange certificate for verification and obtain an export settlement goods registration form. (3) Upon receiving the registration form filled out by the merchant, Fu Hua Company or other designated agency will check it to ensure that it is consistent with the information contained in the purchase foreign exchange certificate, and will immediately store the registration form, fill out an export settlement goods registration certificate, and issue it to the merchant together with the purchase foreign exchange certificate. (4) The export settlement goods registration certificate mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be submitted by the merchant when applying for a certificate of actual sales price. In addition, in order to facilitate the transportation of local goods to other ports and inland areas, the Jianghai Customs has approved that local goods transported to this port by non-ordinary vessels shall enjoy the benefits of re-export. Now, in order to improve the speed of transporting local goods to foreign countries, the Commissioner of Customs has stipulated that if local goods that have completed transit tax in this port are transported to other ports and then intend to be exported to foreign countries, if they wish to apply to the Customs for an export certificate in order to apply for a tax refund from the Customs where the goods arrive, they must prepare a duplicate of the certificate and submit it to the Customs for direct delivery to the Customs of that port, so that the goods can be quickly shipped when they arrive at the port and avoid disputes. All customs brokers and merchants in this port have heard this and have followed the instructions.

### Elementary School Students Respond to the Winter Clothing Drive

The cultural, educational, and student circles of this city have widely embraced the winter clothing drive. The achievements of major middle and elementary schools are quite remarkable. The enthusiasm of the cultural, educational, and student circles of this city for national affairs is evident. Now, the drive has been promoted to elementary school students, who are also participating voluntarily. The number of elementary school students in this city is the highest among all cities in the country, and their achievements will undoubtedly be even more impressive.

### The President Liners Arrive in Shanghai One After Another

British commercial liners, whether traveling the Far East or European routes, will not announce their sailing schedules, including departure and arrival dates, in order to adapt to wartime measures after the European war and avoid attacks. This applies to both ocean-going giants and coastal vessels. This order has already arrived here, so British commercial liner companies in this city will comply. Furthermore, it is learned that the American President Liner Company's President Pierce arrived in Shanghai from Rocky Mountain at 10:30 yesterday morning, carrying 101 passengers and 47 bags of American mail. The liner is scheduled to depart for Zamboanga and Manila at 7:00 this morning. The company's President Cleveland is expected to sail back to Shanghai from Manila and Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 28th, berthing at buoy number 12.13. The passenger tender will arrive at the new customs pier at 2:30 that afternoon. The large liner is scheduled to weigh anchor at 8:00 on the morning of the 29th and return to Los Angeles via Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and San Francisco. Additionally, the Java Mail Line's Tjinegara is scheduled to depart this afternoon, returning to Java via Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Manila.

### Exemption of Foreign Exchange Settlement for Domestic Goods Shipped to Shanghai; Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram Expressing Gratitude

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, having received approval for the exemption of foreign exchange settlement for domestic goods shipped to Shanghai, has sent a telegram expressing its gratitude. The telegram reads: "Respectfully addressed to the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing. Your telegraph of the 'Qiao' code has been received with gratitude. The exemption of foreign exchange settlement for domestic goods shipped to Shanghai, except for those specifically designated, is a virtuous decree that will be appreciated by all industries. This telegram is sent in reply to express our sincere gratitude. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."

### Repair of Yitang Lane Bridge; Temporary Interruption of Traffic

The Yitang Lane Bridge, which connects Shanxi Road to North Shanxi Road, is currently undergoing repairs by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession due to bridge damage. Traffic will be temporarily interrupted during the repair period. The department has blocked both ends of the bridge and erected wooden signs prohibiting the passage of people and vehicles. Those who wish to cross the bridge to the north of Suzhou Creek must detour via Tianhou Palace Bridge or Old Zha Gate Bridge.

### After Exemption of Foreign Exchange Settlement for Domestic Goods, Shanghai-Ningbo Passenger and Cargo Transport are Fully Loaded; Hai Da Not Allowed to Carry Passengers, Did Not Depart Yesterday; Xin'an Na to Conduct Trial Voyage to Wenzhou Today

Since the Ministry of Finance stipulated that all domestic goods exported from Ningbo must be settled in foreign exchange, merchants had to double the cost of procurement, making it impossible to purchase. As a result, the transport of domestic goods to Shanghai disappeared, and the shipping lines were significantly affected. Therefore, the Sino-Italian Company's Ende, Jardine Matheson's Taipo, and Butterfield & Swire's Yingzhou successively changed their routes.

It is now learned that the Shanghai and Ningbo Chambers of Commerce have sent numerous telegrams to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the exemption of foreign exchange settlement in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. The Ministry of Finance has approved the request. The first batch of exported goods, 1,200 pieces of domestic paper, has been transported by Jardine Matheson's Hai Da. The second batch, loaded on the Moufu, also arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday. It is said that the third batch, loaded on the Yongtai Marler, fully loaded, may arrive today or tomorrow. In the future, the previous method can still be followed, and traffic will be unimpeded.

The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line has become active again. As for goods transported to Ningbo, there are also quite a few. The Hai Da was originally scheduled to depart for Ningbo at 4:00 the afternoon before yesterday. Due to the large amount of cargo, it could not be fully loaded, so the departure was changed to yesterday afternoon. However, it still could not be fully loaded, so it was changed again to midnight last night. The ship had previously sold more than 700 passenger tickets. Unexpectedly, at around 4:00 yesterday afternoon, Jardine Matheson received a notice from the Norwegian Consul that the Hai Da was not allowed to carry passengers. Most of the passengers had already boarded the ship, so the company sent personnel to the ship to explain to the passengers and exchange tickets for the Deping. Those who did not want to exchange tickets were refunded the fare. This procedure was not completed until 10:00 last night. A small number of passengers refused to exchange tickets, refused to refund the tickets, and refused to disembark. The crew tried to persuade them without success. Therefore, the ship could not weigh anchor. According to the crew, the ship could only depart after all passengers had disembarked. It was impossible to depart tonight (i.e., last night), so the departure was changed to this morning for Ningbo. The Moufu is scheduled to depart for Ningbo this afternoon. It is said that both passengers and cargo are fully loaded. The British liner Xin'an Na, represented by the American company William Weiley & Han Company in this city, after a trial voyage to Fujian and back to Shanghai, is now maintaining Shanghai-Wenzhou transportation. It has been chartered by Xie Yu and others from the customs declaration firm and is scheduled to conduct a trial voyage to Wenzhou today, carrying a large number of passengers and cargo. If it is not allowed to depart, it will change course to Ao Jiang. If it still cannot enter Ao Jiang, it will proceed to Zhenhai.

### Japanese Consulate General to Expel Vagrant Japanese Nationals; These Individuals Rely on Force to Extort Money and Engage in Base Business; The Number of Those Being Deported is Unclear

### Murder of Chen Tingsheng; Adulterous Couple Sentenced to Heavy Penalties; Other Criminals Also Heavily Punished

Chen Tingsheng, aka Chen Sanzi, a native of Zhenjiang and owner of the Huaxing Paperboard Factory at No. 39 Haigeli, Haige Road, in western Shanghai, was originally a member of the Ma Lishi gang. Because Chen Wang's (aka Wang Guizhen, the younger sister of Wang Xinda, a member of the Fahua gang) with whom he had been cohabitating for fourteen years, recently had an affair with Tao Boqing (aka Big-Headed Boqing), a gangster from Xujiahui, forming a love triangle.

### The Harvest of the Times

— Ding Di

I believe that the path of literary workers is not permanently bound by rules and regulations. It does not have a fixed and unchangeable track and must change with the ever-changing times and environment. The American critic Calverton argued this in "The Sociological Criticism of Literature." In China, there is also a saying that "if there is no new change, it cannot replace the hero," and "one should be afraid of all old things." (See "Book of Qi, Biography of Literature") The only reason for this is that literature certainly "inherits from the past," but more importantly, it "enlightens the future." On the one hand, it is true, as Le Bon said, "the dead guide more than the living," but it is more meaningful to say that modern people influence the future than to say that modern people are influenced by the ancients.

Nietzsche said, "You don't have to love the country of your ancestors, but love the country of your grandchildren." These two sentences are sufficient to show the importance of pioneering an era. Sydney Herbert, in his book "Nationality and its Problems," drew many examples from the history of English literature to illustrate that the revival of literature in a certain period is often enough to make the nationality also have vitality. It can be seen that the importance of literature lies not only in reflecting or expressing the times, but also in being able to pioneer the times and influence the spirit of the nationality of future generations.

"Canglang Shihua says: Before the Dali era, it was clearly a set of language. In the late Tang Dynasty, it was clearly a different set of language." This illustrates that even the appearance of the front and back of a dynasty is different. It can be seen that literature reflects the times. As long as the times have undergone some great changes, this wonderful photograph that contains the reflection will naturally become dazzling and moving. Therefore, we can say that the times are the roots, buds, branches and leaves of plants, while literature is the flowering and fruiting of them. Reflecting the times is not a problem, just as flowering and fruiting are natural things. But we must pay attention to this: before harvesting, we must add some horticultural surgery of moving branches and cutting leaves to make it more suitable for our own needs, and how to pick flowers and how to pick fruits, these should also be carefully studied. Just as we said just now, to open up an era, what kind of path should we take?

According to Le Bon's theory that the influence of predecessors on future generations is very powerful, we should naturally revive the sound nationality that has been neglected for a long time, whether intentionally or unintentionally, which also coincides with Herbert's theory. The best example in China is the liberation of the ancient prose style of the Qin and Han dynasties from the hands of the Four Great Masters of the early Tang Dynasty, and the revival of the empirical spirit of the Han Confucians in the Qing Dynasty. However, it should be absolutely noted that this is definitely not the inheritance of ancestors accepted lock, and picking and choosing still depend on the guidance of the leaders of the times.

Based on this, the harvest of the times is more than just the environment at that time. The past is also a kind of source. However, relying solely on this method is absolutely not enough, and "the dominant concept of an era" cannot but be firmly grasped. Taine said, "No matter what period, there will inevitably be a dominant concept that always runs through it. For two to five hundred years, ideal characters have often existed in the present. The Middle Ages was the age of warriors and monks; our classical age was the age of the court and gentle debaters." Then our era naturally also has a "dominant concept" of a goal. This "dominant concept" exists in everyone's heart and feels deeply sad and oppressed, it can be said that few people are exceptions, and it is extremely suitable to use it to express the national spirit of this era. As for the ancient "barbarians who confuse the Xia", the historical facts and the spirit of the nationality, we may also use them to revive literature. However, this is definitely not the only harvest of the times. The current era has its unique characteristics that are different from those of its predecessors, and there is a "dominant concept" existing in the hearts of some people. We must not ignore this.

### Silver in the Miao Region

— Yan Changxu

"I don't want paper money!" When I arrived in southern Guizhou and wanted to buy an egg for a dime, an old woman answered me like this. This attitude could not help but surprise me, so I asked back, "If you don't want paper money, what can you use? Why don't you want the central government's money?"

The answer was very simple: "We use small change, because paper money can be torn or burned by fire if you're not careful, and we don't know if it's real or fake."

"Hmm!" It was for this reason that my heart was naturally uneasy.

"Small change! What does small change look like?" I began to ask for the second time.

"Small change! Uh! It looks like this." As she spoke, she took out a silver coin from 1920 from her pocket, the kind that we used to use in Shanghai and other places, and showed it to me with a somewhat impatient look.

"Oh! Small change, so that's what it is." I smiled, but then turned to pain.

For the sake of business, she seemed to change her attitude: "Sir, it doesn't matter if you don't have small change; but paper money has to be discounted by 20%, otherwise,..."

Knowing that she was going to say "I don't want it!" but my stomach was empty, I was really a little panicked, so I interrupted her, "Okay! 20% off then!" Only then did I manage to buy a few eggs.

While sitting on a low stool peeling eggshells, I saw a Han Chinese and greeted him and started talking. Later, we also talked about this issue in a rambling way. It turned out that he had lived here for many years and understood everything very well: "They—the Miao people—don't rely on outside forces for anything. Outsiders who come here must buy their things; if you don't have small change, there's no way to do it except by exchanging things with them. They have a self-sufficient instinct. Now, look; you can't estimate how much silver each Miao person (except for a few poor ones) has in their hands. At the same time, for safety, almost every family has a cellar that is not easy for outsiders to find..."

He fell silent and then looked at me very deeply.

I blankly stuffed the whole egg into my mouth, thinking, "This is not good, we really need to get more political work done with these Miao people."

I looked at him, and he smiled.

I chewed the egg in confusion, trying to swallow it, but suddenly I felt suffocated and couldn't breathe.

"What's the point of stuffing it down like that?"

I glared at him again and realized that he was talking about hiding silver. I secretly laughed at myself for being so hasty and clumsy in my actions.

### The Nourishment of Life

— Zhang Genyuan

Every evening, as I walk through this open space filled with a heavy stench, I am always so moved: How much people need this nourishment of life!

I watch those laborers; they seem to have completely forgotten the day's toil and all their worries. They mingle in the crowd, laughing and talking; everything is positive, energetic, far removed from their own gloomy lives. Here, they find joy, no! They find the nourishment of life!

In this exceptionally suffocating and foul-smelling corner—the only place they can gather, near their dilapidated houses—these laborers often come running to assemble at this seemingly predetermined time. Those tired and sallow faces begin to smile in the moonlight, and those bloodshot eyes also gleam with joyful radiance. They listen to each other's stories and pour out what they want to say in front of the crowd. Some are joyful, singing low-class tunes that would make noble ladies frown, or telling obscene jokes similar to those of gentlemen; some are excited, telling legendary tales of great victories in the Changsha battles, or pounding their chests and vowing that they would rather die than be traitors or slaves of a fallen nation; some are resentful, loudly scolding a certain boss who only knows how to bow and scrape to certain merchants, begging them to deign to eat with him, yet stingily exploiting them, or cursing the ruthlessness of the passport officials… In these moments, they are happy. Although the foul odor constantly assaults their noses, they habitually and warmly absorb it while pouring out a bellyful of grievances, just like wealthy people sitting in magnificent living rooms. They often gesticulate wildly as they speak. And there is absolute freedom to yawn, sneeze, and stretch, without anyone interfering with them, except perhaps their wives, who have the right to call them in to sleep. Occasionally, the young kids, Little Sanzi and Little Liuzi, annoyingly reach out to beg for copper coins, only to be met with a wide-eyed, intimidating rebuke: "Bah! Where's the copper coin from? There's none! We're barely making ends meet! One move and it's a penny gone."

There is an old man who doesn't talk much, but I often see him as one of them. He often sits by a pile of garbage, pensively smoking his cigarette. On the surface, it seems he doesn't like talking much to the young people, but his face is constantly revealing a smile of nostalgic fascination. He is a lonely old man! The young people don't pay much attention to him (the young people think he is lonely.) But he desperately needs this nourishment of life. Even though he doesn't talk much, he is satisfied. Although his youth has already flashed through his life, watching these young people is his comfort!

I stand there, sometimes motionless.

Walking home, so moved.

The old man's smile, the young laborers' joy, surround my heart; I feel lonely, I eagerly yearn for such nourishment of life!

### Memory

— Pinpin

Baudelaire said, "If I could live a thousand years, my memories would be even more numerous." How much he valued memory! But I saw one of our poets write: If people had no memory, they would be happier. He originally despised memory so much.

I feel confused. Why do people's thoughts diverge like mountain paths? I thought for a while, hoping for a solution. Oh, I understand; memories are of all kinds, so opinions about memory also vary greatly.

Memories, in a very rough generalization, are of two kinds: memories of one's own past life; memories of the nation's past events.

If a person's memory is mostly painful. A person only opens the treasure chest of memory when in poverty: love letters, gifts of love, debt notes, childhood spinning tops, mother's needlework, rejected manuscripts... everything is covered in dust, and even things that are not dim become dim. For example, you find a red peach leaf, or a stub of a check; in the past, it was glorious, but now you are trapped, poor, and holding it in your palm, you will have a bitter taste in your throat—these things have scattered like clouds, and like the sea, they will never return. The wealthy do not know memory; they already have both fish and bear paws. The poor want to pan for a little gold in memory, but in vain, instead panning out a handful of tears.

Then it is the turn of another kind of memory. Let us put history aside; it is too old to stir up big waves. You should remember the motherland's struggle in the past two years! At a snowy crossroads, in front of an autumn wind-swept window, by the water's edge under the blazing sun, you must close your eyes and think: your hometown has turned to ashes, your relatives have bled and died, loyal soldiers are fighting, wounded, and martyred in severe cold and heat (when they destroy the invaders), your friends are serving in the rear... many, many stories of blood and sweat, and the center of it all is one thing: the liberation of the Republic of China. Shame, envy, anger, all make the heart beat faster. You must let the heart beat; once the heart dies, strength is also gone. Although with a bit of bitter taste, this bitter taste is the bitter taste of medicine, which will heal your departing strength.

Don't be discouraged, just remember, let the memory of the old struggle of the motherland be the inspirer of the waves of our lives!

### Film Knowledge: The Production Process of Cartoons

— Qintian

Ten thousand consecutive drawings are shown in only six minutes Sixteen drawings represent one step of Mickey Mouse

Walt Disney, the creator of the extremely popular Mickey Mouse cartoon in Hollywood, has recently founded a large-scale company in Hollywood. The sole purpose of this company is to produce cartoon films.

A very short cartoon, shown on the screen for only six minutes, requires ten thousand consecutive drawings. Each drawing, the image moves slightly, sixteen small drawings can represent Mickey Mouse taking a step, the first, eighth or sixteenth shows the mouse in action, the intermediate daytime film is just the formation of this action.

Regarding the drawing, originally drawn in pencil on white paper, later changed to pen, and then the back of the transparent paper is coated with black and white or gray-white colloid, so that the lines are drawn on, the image can be displayed. If it is a color film, then probably use color to replace the gray and white primer. Each drawing is carefully marked with a number, so as not to make mistakes.

One sheet represents Mickey Mouse's body, another sheet represents Mickey Mouse's hands, feet, and legs. Connected in this way, sometimes the body can be spared. First, the person in charge drafts the sample, pointing out the same action drawings to replace, so that in terms of time, it can certainly save a lot. If Mickey Mouse's hand is to be tightly gripped, it has already been pointed out on the sample, perhaps hundreds of them are the same.

If the Mickey Mouse cartoon is a sound film, it must also be dubbed after the drawing is completed. Mickey Mouse's movements must fully match the rhythm of the sound, this work is also very troublesome, it takes a lot of thought.

### Talking about Cheng Yanqiu (Part 1)

— Guo Duo

We have seen many articles discussing Cheng Yanqiu, but opinions vary, each with their own understanding. I dare not say that other people's understanding is wrong, but I feel that their understanding is not thorough enough. Therefore, I will discuss it again.

Cheng Yanqiu's singing: singing includes both voice and singing method. Voice mostly relies on talent, while singing method depends entirely on hard work. Many people say that Cheng Yanqiu's voice is not as high as Mei Lanfang's, because Yanqiu's Xipi opera sings in the six-and-a-half tone, and the Erhuang opera sings in the climbing half-tone, while Lanfang's Xipi opera sings in the orthodox tone, and the Erhuang opera sings in the six-and-a-half tone, which seems correct. But we often hear Yanqiu singing opera, when he sings to a high-pitched passage, we only feel that his singing voice goes straight into the clouds, lingering for three days without end! Not to mention Lanfang, even Chen Delin and Shang Xiaoyun are not as loud, what is the reason for this? In my humble opinion, I think this is because Yanqiu's voice is broad. Because his voice is broad, so his pronunciation is loud; although the tone is not high, singing it is not lower than usual.

Yanqiu knew his innate special voice, so he thought of a special singing method to suit his talent, so there was the creation of the so-called "Cheng tune". The characteristics of Cheng's tune are many, flipping high and low, intonation, is an important one. When flipping high, it is like the roar of a sea wave, when going low, it is like the floating of soft silk. The listener is suddenly thrilled, and suddenly fascinated. Even friends who usually like to watch but not listen, their spirits will immediately be excited after listening to such a singing tune. And Yanqiu in one word and one sentence, often participate in the intonation singing method, vigorous and clean, ups and downs are happy. And his pronunciation of words and return to rhyme are all in accordance with the rules, very particular. We can know from many places: Yanqiu's in-depth research on singing methods, every word and sentence, all use painstaking effort, constantly looking for new and pleasing tunes. Therefore, Cheng's tune can be popular for a while, it is not accidental. Those who learn Cheng should not only learn his singing method, but also learn his research spirit!

### New Film Introduction: Spring Madness

— Qi Hua

“Spring Madness”

I remember in an aviation film starring Clark Gable, because his lover did not allow him to engage in dangerous sky flight, this brave and stalwart man "tenderly" threw himself into his lover's arms. In "Spring Madness", the college student Sam also gave up his trip to the Soviet Union to pursue love with the girl Alice. This is the specialty of Hollywood playwrights: love, love, love, putting the country and career behind.

Not only that, but the male students in "Spring Madness" have become well-fed and idle through the playwright's love-supremacy, except for talking about love. What about those female students? When dancing with a male cadre, they didn't even know he was a professor, and asked for his name. Perhaps this is a "gimmick" to elicit laughter from the audience, but I laughed very unnaturally. Walking out of the theater, I met a friend who had studied in the United States, and he said: "Very interesting! This is indeed the case in the United States!" I couldn't help but be stunned for a long time.

The director naturally also tried his best to create jokes on these male and female college students. That Lippincott wrote such an "interesting" character, is a good example. And the famous publishers, police chiefs, and college professors are willing to be manipulated by the "women's army", which is another example.

Maureen O'Sullivan doesn't have many scenes. But in a scene with Louis-Alice in the gym, wearing a parallel bar rack back and forth, the little girl's thoughts were transmitted in twists and turns, and several shots of crying back in the bedroom were performed very movingly. And in the light and dark light, she lifted her skirt and swirled, and the clock pulled in the center of the parallel bar rack, the photography is very beautiful.

The Torrent Drama Society originally scheduled to hold its first Sunday performance from the twenty-second of this month, but due to procedural reasons, it was postponed to ten o'clock in the morning on the twenty-ninth of this month, and it will still be officially performed at the Lapei Grand Theater. As for the script, it is still "Rice Merchant" written by Zhiyin—formerly named Rice—(directed by Wang Zhuyou) and "The Flower of the Passerby" translated by Ba Jin from Amicis's original work (directed by Zheng Zhong). The stage supervisor is Chuan William, and there is Chen Gexin's string orchestra accompaniment. It is also heard that all the coupons issued on the twenty-second are universal.

Xu Muyun's "Pear Garden Movie Affairs", edited by Xu Muyun, is the most perfect book for studying drama, with 300 photos of famous actors from ancient and modern times, dozens of kinds of colorful drama photos and facial makeup, and the text is no less than 100,000 words. It cost a lot of money, so it is extremely exquisite. Last month, 200 copies of Yu Shu were sold cheaply at the Nanxiaoxing Bookstore on Henan Road, Simalu, priced at eight yuan, now only sold for three yuan, the sale will be closed after the sale.

Du Ao's Fan Service Agency, entrusted by various stars, sends signed photos on behalf of the stars, collecting one corner for printing and mailing costs per photo, and sending them to Shanghai Post Office Box 2020.

Errata: In the fourth section of yesterday's Yu Mansion Hall, line 13, the "Mao" in "Mao Shang" was misprinted as the rabbit, which should be corrected immediately.

### New Soviet Film: "The White-Clad Princess"

Pushkin's works, translated into Chinese, have been numerous over the years, and many of his story poems have also been translated, such as "The Story of the Fish and the Fisherman," which is relatively famous. His longest fairy tale poem, perhaps because it has thousands of sentences, has not yet appeared in Chinese translation until now. The original name of this poem is "Ruslan and Ludmila", which writes about the deeds of the King of Kiev in ancient Russia, mixed with many legends of wild old men of the past dynasties, rendering it strangely. This long poem was adapted into an opera by Glinka, a great composer of Pushkin's era, and was first performed in St. Petersburg in 1842. This opera is also on the program of this year's Soviet Drama Festival.

Last year, the Moscow Film Factory in the Soviet Union also put this fairy tale poem known to Russian women and children on the screen, and many scenes of gods and monsters were filmed with new techniques. If it is said that this is a mythological film, it is certainly inappropriate, but it is worth seeing how the Soviet Union handles mythological themes. The film will be screened at Huguang from the 27th.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The issue of gold and silver in the Ulongyuan play

According to the old words, it is "This is a gold ingot, let me take it," and there is no mention of buying candy. Although it is a bit abrupt, it is not against the reason, and it will not lead to raw gold. Dan said silver, at the same time and place, actually put two different names on the same thing. There is also a layer, at the end, Song Jiang killed Mrs. Yan, and Yan Po哀告道 said: "Look at the old man's share and reward him with a coffin." 生白: "This has ten taels of silver, you go to do it." The audience should not misunderstand, how could Song Jiang just take out the gold letter from Po Xi's arms, put it in his arms, and then take it out and hand it to Yan Po, it becomes ten taels of silver? If you really think like this, then it can be screwed up. Because Chinese opera is symbolic, the person who is on the front stage takes the fake gold ingot, and when it comes to the appropriate point in the play, they only know to secretly hand it to the people in the play. Gold is also it, silver is also it, more is also it, less is also it, handed back and forth, it is this one, as for calling it gold or silver, or making the weight heavy or light, it all depends on the singing and reciting words in the play to determine its value. The audience must understand this layer, and they can know that Song Sanye will never not bring even a ten tael silver ingot. If he really went out like a loser, and intended to eat and drink for free, then he would not be 人　 for timely rain or righteous Song Jiang. It can be seen from this that what was taken out later was not the gold ingot that was stuffed into his arms before. Then the Sheng character first recites gold, and here again says silver, which is really different from the Dan character's clearly using gold as silver, so this cannot be said to be the Sheng character's fault. Chinese opera is really too tortuous, even if there is an instruction manual, sometimes the audience does not understand it, so I put forward the above points, which can be regarded as supplementing the shortcomings of the instruction manual.
