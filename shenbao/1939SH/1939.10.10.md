The Course of the Great Battle in Northern Hunan

A reporter from a certain place in northern Hunan paid a visit to a certain commander at a certain place in the front on the 8th and inquired about the process of annihilating the Japanese army in northern Hunan. He was received and answered each question as follows: (Question) It is said that the Japanese invasion this time was aimed at plundering our lake area's rice to alleviate the difficulties of their military food supply. I wonder if the real purpose of the Japanese invasion was really this? (Answer) Judging from the Japanese's consistent stingy behavior, I dare not say that there is no such attempt. However, after the government and the people jointly rushed to transport the rice in the lake area, they were unable to plunder it. I believe that the biggest reason is that since the July 7th Incident, their cabinet has changed repeatedly, and the government's control has become weaker and weaker. For a year, there has been no military progress. Not only has there been criticism domestically, but international prestige has also been greatly reduced. To cover up their ugliness, they want to show that their new cabinet can take advantage of the European war, speculate and take advantage, and rob while the fire is burning, which is why they launched this invasion. (Question) The Japanese army retreated in a hurry less than two weeks after this invasion. What is the reason? Can you tell us something about the process of the battle? (Answer) It is better to say that it was a rout than a retreat, because their rear was cut off by us everywhere. If they do not know their limits, they will be completely annihilated by us. As for the battle process of the Japanese invasion of Changsha, it is divided into three routes, with northern Hunan as the main attack, and southern Hubei and northern Jiangxi as supporting attacks. The Japanese in southern Hubei were the [omitted] division (three-regiment system). They invaded Maishi from southeast of Tongcheng. According to our predetermined strategy, we lured the Japanese to the vicinity of Taoshugang, surrounded them on three sides, and attacked them from both sides. The remains of those killed by us, which were buried by our army, amounted to more than three thousand. The wounded were twice as many. Only more than two thousand people escaped to the Changshou Street area, and they were also annihilated by us. Except for those left to guard the rear, it can be said that no one escaped from this enemy army. It was an unprecedented feat since the beginning of the war. The enemy in northern Hunan was the entire [omitted] division, the [omitted] third division, and the naval landing force. After our army launched successive attacks at Changhu and Fulinpu, and reached the vicinity of Fulinpu and Sanjieqiao, they were severely attacked by our ambush troops, and casualties piled up. With the supply of ammunition cut off, they fled north in droves. The casualties of the enemy on this route were at least over 15,000. The [omitted] third division in northern Jiangxi invaded west from Xiushui, and after being severely attacked by us in the areas east of Gao'an and Luofang, Shangfu, Ganfang, Huangshaqiao, and Da'e, due to heavy casualties, the remnants gradually fled east, in a state of unprecedented panic. (Question) After the enemy's failure this time, will they increase their troops and invade Changsha again? (Answer) The question is not whether they will invade again, or whether they can occupy one or two key points, but what price they will pay when they invade, and how to manage the aftermath after they occupy them. In other words, it is possible for the enemy warlords to transfer three or five more divisions to China, but even if they can occupy some key points after adding three or five more divisions, it can still be determined that they cannot solve the entire war situation. The deeper the enemy goes, the greater their difficulties will be, and the more they increase their troops, the faster their collapse will be. (Question) Why did our army win such a great victory this time? (Answer) In terms of combat spirit, our army has always been in an active position. All units and soldiers can cooperate with each other, do not avoid difficulties and dangers, and can attack the enemy in any difficult environment. There has never been a situation of collapse, which is completely different from the enemy's lack of fighting spirit and mutual resentment between superiors and subordinates. The help of the broad masses of the people in assisting the army in joint operations is the main reason for our victory. In terms of terrain, the Mufu and Jiugong mountains are intertwined, and the roads are rugged, so that we can cut off the enemy everywhere, creating an irreparable situation. (Question) What are the commander's thoughts on this battle? Can the enemy's attempt to destroy China be shattered? (Answer) I have often said that the destruction of a country must have three conditions: (1) The people's national consciousness is reduced; (2) All the land is occupied by others; (3) The military force is resolved by others. Looking back at our country after the war, national consciousness is high, most of the land except for a few points of money is still controlled by us, and the more we fight, the stronger we become. The enemy has not been able to conquer us for two years, and will never be able to conquer us in the future. In the past, Xiang Yu fought seventy-two battles and won every battle. As soon as he heard the songs of Chu, he was defeated. Today's Japanese warlords are more brutal than Xiang Yu, and have more than Xiang Yu's invincible spirit. However, they are very reckless in their actions. It can be concluded that they will be defeated in their war against us. This battle is just the greatest success of the tactical change in the second phase of the War of Resistance. (8th Dispatch)

### British Ambassador Visits Foreign Minister Wang

Chongqing - British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, flew here from Hong Kong two days ago and will stay in Chongqing for some time.

All the affairs of the diplomatic mission will be temporarily handled by Mr. Haight, the second secretary of the British Embassy. (9th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing - Since arriving here on the 7th, British Ambassador Kerr has been very busy visiting Chinese dignitaries. However, he has not yet been able to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, because the Chairman is still in Chengdu. Today, the Shishi Xinbao published an editorial on the British Ambassador's arrival in Chongqing, saying that since Japan has declared that there is no possibility of reopening British-Japanese negotiations at present, but Britain still hopes for the resumption of British-Japanese conferences, is this not different from indulging in the illusion of compromise with Japan? The newspaper deeply regrets the wavering of British Far Eastern policy, and said that the British people should know the following three points: (1) China is determined to resolutely resist the war to the end; (2) There is no hope of ending the war until China achieves complete victory; (3) Only with China's victory can there be strength for world peace. (9th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Reminiscences of the Twenty-Eighth National Day

On October 10, 1911, the Chinese Revolutionary Army initiated the uprising in Wuchang. Prior to this, the banner of righteousness had been raised several times, but all ended in failure. On this day of this year, however, success was achieved in one fell swoop, creating a republic and establishing the Republic of China. To this day, it has been twenty-eight years since the old country received a new life. In terms of history, twenty-eight years is only a short fragment. When discussing matters, it has always been said that "thirty years is one generation," which is still less than one generation. When discussing people, how long is human life? It is like a white horse passing through a crack, but it must be said that "thirty years is strong," which is still not yet the age of strength. Moreover, in a great nation of five thousand years, which contains endless sources of life and carries on the past and opens up the future, it is just beginning to flourish, then it can be said that twenty-eight years is not worth mentioning.

Creation is truly fond of teasing people. Tracing back to the time since mankind has had records, the international joys and sorrows, reunions and separations, prosperity and decline, and rise and fall, the drama of their evolution, and the scientific exploration of the mysteries and subtle details, and the conquest of nature, the number of original ideas is greater than these twenty-eight years. Even in China, within these fleeting twenty-eight years, the internal turbulence and external encounters have been extremely turbulent, extremely serious, extremely tragic, and extremely glorious, which is not only unprecedented in Chinese history, but also no country or nation, at any period, can be compared with China during these twenty-eight years. If we look back, all the worrying, joyful, commendable, and tearful deeds are vividly in our eyes and hearts, and none of them are not personally experienced and witnessed by today's elderly and middle-aged people; and today, we are still staying in this most exciting great era.

The various things since the establishment of the Republic of China are too numerous to recount, and it is not necessary to recount them. However, there are things that are worth summarizing and comparing: China's international status, national consciousness, political phenomena, cultural standards, economic situation, and social organization in the late Qing Dynasty, compared to today after twenty-eight years, although not ideal, not enough to compete with the modern era, each has made significant progress, which is visible to all. Since the rise of the War of Resistance, although many weaknesses have been exposed, there are more than enough clear proofs of the advantages of the nation. After 1895, the international community regarded China as foolish and deceitful, and discussions of partition arose everywhere. Fortunately, thanks to the balance of power, it barely maintained its existence. In the early days of the Republic of China, it was still entrusting its fate to the balance of power, which cannot be denied. As the times changed, the strength of various countries gradually became disparate due to the ebb and flow. The situation of the balance of power was precarious. If China's phenomena were the same as in the late Qing Dynasty, then at the latest in the most recent two or three years, Britain and France would be controlled by Europe, and the United States would be unable to help those who do not help themselves. China would be destroyed, Japan would be the sole hegemon, and would Europeans and Americans in the Far East have a foothold? Fortunately, China is determined to resist the war. Subjectively, this is to save the country and survive, but objectively, its function is to bravely deal with the aggressor country, which is to support the declining order in the Far East. Not only that, but it also prevents the aggressor countries in Europe and Asia from colluding with each other. China is also fighting vigorously and effectively for the balance of power in the entire world. If British and French people speak with a clear conscience, if it were not for China's resistance to the war, would Britain and France not face greater threats in Europe and Asia at the same time that they could not take care of? China's resistance to the war is a necessity for establishing the country, not to perform for the international community, but China's international status has risen far beyond the late Qing Dynasty, which is recognized by the international community.

National consciousness is the spiritual barrier for a country to stand in the international community. The achievements of the Xinhai Revolution can naturally prove that it was a political revolution. However, anyone who is old or middle-aged who can recall the situation of the Xinhai Revolution will not recognize that the revolution at that time was based on national consciousness. At that time, only the imperial court and the imperial family had not yet eliminated the boundaries between Manchus and Han. Those very few people regarded hundreds of millions of people as foreigners and ruled over them, so it was not surprising that they were unlucky. Moreover, after losing wars and territories to foreign countries, the politics were corrupt, the discipline was ruined, officials were sold and ranks were sold, bribery was rampant, exorbitant taxes were levied, and the people were not living. Were they still engaged in deceiving the people? The Wuchang Uprising and the response of the provinces were unprecedented in their momentum. However, the national consciousness revealed in it was quite common, but not as common and in-depth as it is now. Today, the people of China do not complain when they suffer from war disasters, and they do not refuse to go to sacrifices. After more than two years of hard fighting, the army has displayed its courage to continue its efforts, so it has recently won a great victory in northern Hunan. The people have maintained their hatred of the enemy, so they scoff at various political methods of confusion and temptations for complacency and compromise, and are unmoved. This is because the national consciousness is common and in-depth, which is not enough.

As for the general political phenomena, cultural standards, economic situation, and social organization, we do not have time to list the events before and after twenty-eight years and compare them one by one. However, the past was extremely dim and the recent years have tended to be bright, which is personally experienced by any elderly and middle-aged person. This can be seen in the extraordinary period, which is full of mutations. Even this mutation is difficult to imagine in the late Qing Dynasty. Let me describe two or three points: How do the technicians and experts recruited by government offices today compare to the various sitting officials and conference officials of the Qing Dynasty? How do the quality and quantity of today's elementary school textbooks compare to the curriculum of the elementary schools of the Qing Dynasty? How do the goods in today's domestic goods market compare to the foreign goods and local goods in the market of the Qing Dynasty? How do the groups of today's industry and commerce compare to the chambers of commerce that only had "government supervision and merchant management" in the Qing Dynasty? From this, we can see the general situation.

In short, the progress of China in the past twenty-eight years, although it cannot be said to be satisfactory, is by no means a waste of time, and this cannot be achieved without revolution.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Most Encouraging Message to the National People on National Day: Do Not Fail the Hardships of the Martyrs in Creating the Nation, Rise Up Together to Complete the Mission of Defending the Country

Chengdu - On the 28th National Day, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a message to the national people, saying that today is the 28th anniversary of the founding of our Republic of China. Our national soldiers and civilians have been fighting hard for more than two years. Recalling the hardships of the martyrs in creating the nation and looking forward to the bright future of the revolution, we know that all our compatriots must have the enthusiasm to strive forward and catch up quickly. Recently, we have won a victory in northern Hunan, which has slightly washed away the blood and slightly comforted the grief and indignation of our compatriots. However, the war of resistance and national construction have a myriad of aspects. The responsibility of our compatriots will inevitably become more difficult as the final victory approaches. On this glorious anniversary of the revolution, I would like to sincerely convey the following key points to our compatriots: First, our compatriots must recognize that our country today is a country in the midst of a revolution. Our war of resistance is to realize the Three Principles of the People and complete the National Revolution. Throughout history, revolutionary undertakings must go through countless dangers and hardships before they can achieve success. There is absolutely no reason to hope for a fluke success. However, once the revolutionary forces are launched, they will never stop until they reach their goal. Once national consciousness is awakened, it can never be hindered by any force. The National Revolution of our China will definitely succeed. When we look back to today twenty-eight years ago, what reliable basis did our revolution have? At that time, there was almost nothing in the military, economic, and diplomatic relations that could be compared with today. However, our Premier Sun Yat-sen raised his arms and called out, and the compatriots of the whole country responded in unison. Even in the midst of nothing, they finally overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic. It is known that the success of revolutionary undertakings lies entirely in the trend of events that conform to the will of Heaven and the people, and the promotion of national spirit. It can never be measured by tangible material conditions. Our current war of resistance and revolution cannot hide the current difficulties, and we must expect even more serious difficulties in the future. However, in terms of the various revolutionary foundations of our current international relations, economic situation, and military strength, they are more solid and stronger than those of any other country's revolution. Therefore, the key lies in whether we have the determination to work hard and sacrifice, and the courage to inherit the cause of the revolutionary martyrs. In other words, if we have this reliable revolutionary foundation, but we still cannot destroy the obstacles and win the victory, so as to obtain the freedom and equality of China, we will not be able to face the martyrs who fought for the country bare-handed on that day. This is what all our compatriots should recognize and strive for. Second, our compatriots should know that the success of the war of resistance in the future does not depend entirely on the superiority or inferiority of the military, but on the spirit of common struggle of the national compatriots. Today, we have established a foundation in the military and will definitely win the final victory. All our frontline soldiers will be able to increasingly enrich the revolutionary foundation, exert military power, and fulfill the natural duty of soldiers to defend the country and protect the race, so as to comfort the expectations of our compatriots. However, the war of resistance in the future must be achieved by the unanimous uprising of our compatriots, using resolute actions to break the enemy's so-called political offensive and economic offensive conspiracies other than military attacks. Therefore, in today's war of resistance, in addition to promoting national righteousness and attacking traitorous acts, so as to destroy the Japanese political organization, the first task is to improve the national integrity of the people in the front, the rear, and especially in the occupied areas, to strictly implement national public morality, to exert the strength of guerrillas, to organize like-minded compatriots, to seize opportunities, and to destroy all economic organizations under the puppet organization and in the occupied areas, to respond to each other, and to destroy all Japanese transportation construction. This kind of work cannot be done by the frontline soldiers alone. It depends on the universal mobilization of compatriots in the occupied areas. What I mean by the center of gravity of the war of resistance in the future not being entirely in the military, but turning to the struggle of the national compatriots, is the second point. Third, the only key to the victory of our war of resistance today, whether in the front or in the rear, lies in destroying the Japanese tools for political aggression. In the future, we have actually entered the stage of intangible spiritual war of resistance from the tangible weapon war of resistance. If there are family members and relatives who are loyal to the enemy, no matter whether they are father and son, brothers, superiors or subordinates, old or young, or even relatives in the family and villages, they must be killed without waiting for the end of the day. In this way, mutual stimulation and common sanctions can make the national flaws swept away. Our country has the ancient训of destroying relatives for righteousness, and it is also known to the people in remote villages. Therefore, promoting righteousness and promoting the national spirit of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame is the most urgent task and the fundamental plan for completing the great cause of the war of resistance. This is what our compatriots must know and must strive for. There is something else that must be stated here. Today, two years ago, it was already appropriate to inform our compatriots that this war is a long-term and arduous struggle, and it is definitely not a short-term battle that can be completed in a year and a half. Since the beginning of the war of resistance, we have embarked on a long and arduous road. Unless we integrate and condense the blood and sweat of the national compatriots and the souls of our revolutionary martyrs into the cause of resisting the war and building the country, and continuously promote them, so as to achieve the entire revolutionary goal, we will never be able to obtain the long-term happiness of the country, nor will we be able to fulfill the great responsibility of our Republic of China to the world. Therefore, today, we must not only not have the slightest fear of difficulty and complacency, but also not have the slightest thought of seeking a quick solution. We cannot be eager to hope for the end of the war and the retreat of the Japanese, and we cannot hope that the Japanese will have the awareness of abandoning aggression. We must know that the fulfillment of the goal of the war of resistance must rely on the full promotion of real strength. We must also realize that before the final victory is obtained, there can be no real peace. Before the Japanese have realized the real power of our comprehensive and sustained war of resistance, there can be no real awareness. On the contrary, if we can front and rear, regardless of soldiers and civilians, regardless of men and women, wisdom and foolishness, unite, persevere in struggle, not fear death, not steal peace, not hesitate to sacrifice, not count the time, and move forward bravely, the longer we last, the more we will strive, then the final victory will surely be realized. Therefore, today, we should abandon our own fear of difficulty and complacency and the psychology of hoping for a quick solution. There is an ancient saying: "It is easy to break the thieves in the mountains, but it is difficult to break the thieves in the heart." Those who cannot endure hardship, cannot persist, cannot persevere to the last five minutes are all thieves written in the heart of the war of resistance and revolution. This is what our compatriots must be deeply aware of. (10th Dispatch)

### National Government Proclaims Several Principles, Reaffirms Governing Authority and Responsibilities, Denies Illegal Actions

Chongqing: The National Government issued a declaration on October 10th, the 28th year of the Republic of China, stating in brief: "Since the founding of the Republic of China, twenty-eight years have passed. Thinking of the difficulty of its creation and mindful of the gravity of our responsibilities, we hereby proclaim several principles on this National Day to encourage our soldiers and civilians. Since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, our frontline soldiers have fought to save the nation and the state, sacrificing themselves to protect our territorial sovereignty. Advancing wave upon wave, undeterred by setbacks, their heroic achievements shine in the annals of history. People from all regions have endured all kinds of suffering, destroying their homes to alleviate national difficulties, vying to support national policies, unwavering from beginning to end. All these contributions are expressions of a sacred patriotic heart, making our national prestige grow daily. Final victory will undoubtedly belong to us. From now on, we hope that all soldiers and civilians throughout the country will not be arrogant or discouraged, but will increase their loyalty and do their utmost to complete the mission of the times. As for traitors and puppets, they disgrace their ancestors and leave a burden to their descendants, not only are they abandoned by all mankind, but they are also not tolerated by national law. This government issued a declaration on December 20th, the 26th year of the Republic of China, stating that any pseudo-political organization found in the occupied areas, and all its actions, both internally and externally, are naturally invalid. Now that our war of resistance has lasted for more than two years, the enemy knows that their military aggression will ultimately fail, so they are trying to entice scoundrels and create puppets, hoping to use them as toys to confuse the public. We hereby reaffirm that the Republic of China alone grants the National Government the legal authority to manage all governing powers, to promulgate laws internally, and to conclude treaties externally. The integrity of our sovereignty must not be violated. Should any puppet organization usurp our name, issue announcements without authorization, or privately conclude documents with any country, they will not be recognized at any time." (9th Dispatch)

### President Kong Understands the Hardships of Soldiers and Civilians in War Zones

Their loyalty to the Party and their love for the country are truly commendable. Now that the military situation is progressing daily, politics should be even more enlightened. I hope that the governments of all war zones will continue to work hard with a spirit of perseverance to achieve complete success. In the midst of joy and encouragement, let us maintain a sense of caution and self-reflection. The boundless blessings of the nation for hundreds of millions of years will begin here."

### Japanese Soldiers Assault and Humiliate American Priest

Peiping: According to a statement issued today by a Japanese military spokesman, a Japanese soldier who assaulted an American Catholic priest, Maloney, on the first of this month while intoxicated, is now impossible to trace. Although the Japanese soldier was taken to the Japanese military headquarters at the time, he was released after the headquarters inquired about his name and number. However, it was later discovered that the name and number provided by the Japanese soldier were purely fabricated at the time, and in fact no such person existed, so it was impossible to summon him for questioning. Therefore, the details claimed by Father Maloney cannot be verified. According to Father Maloney, on the first of this month, outside the gate of the Catholic Church, he heard a commotion. He went outside to see what was happening and saw a drunken Japanese soldier beating a Chinese coolie. Father Maloney stepped forward to mediate, but the Japanese soldier punched him, calling him an "Englishman." Father Maloney insisted that he was an American, but the Japanese soldier insisted that he was an Englishman. Then the Japanese soldier snatched the pipe from Father Maloney's mouth and pushed him aside, entering the church residence and searching it arbitrarily. He confiscated a fountain pen and a Japanese idiom book. Father Maloney then showed the Japanese soldier his American passport, but the Japanese soldier crumpled it into a ball and threw it on the ground, ordering Father Maloney to hand over a woman. Father Maloney said that this was a priest's residence and there were no women, but the Japanese soldier insisted on having him hand one over. Therefore, the priest called the Chinese police for help. The Chinese police, not daring to offend the Japanese soldier, reported it to the Japanese military police, and the matter was settled.

### Soviet and Italian Newspapers Discuss War and Peace Issues, Urge Negotiations Based on Hitler's Proposal, American Newspapers Criticize Hitler's Speech as Absurd

Moscow: Izvestia published an editorial today entitled "Peace or War?" It stated, "The Polish war has been over for several weeks, a fact that no one can deny. The Polish army has been completely captured, and the Polish government has fled abroad. Except for the upper-class landlords and the bourgeoisie, no social stratum in Poland is willing to preserve the paper tiger-like state that they artificially created to oppress all ethnic groups, including the Polish people. The Soviet and German governments have already begun to restore peace and order in the former Polish territory and enable people to live and work in peace according to their ethnic characteristics. The rapid collapse of the Polish state structure has removed the reason for the Western European war to continue. Poland cannot be restored to its original state. This is obvious to the blind. However, Britain and France are still using the restoration of Poland as a slogan to wage war against Germany. This war is a senseless massacre, and a truce is in the interest of all peoples. Although Hitler's proposal can be accepted, rejected, or amended at will, it must be recognized that the proposal can serve as the basis for negotiating peace. Since the British and French governments have repeatedly declared their willingness to achieve peace, they should consider this possibility of ending the war. However, so far, the British and French newspapers' criticisms of Hitler's speech do not indicate this. Most of them advocate rejection. Britain and France should continue to fight until their goals are fully achieved. But one thing is noteworthy in the newspapers' tone, that the main condition of the past, the restoration of Poland, is now relatively silent, and replaced by the 'elimination of Hitlerism.' It is said that the fundamental and sole purpose of Britain and France's current war is to resist Hitler's ideology, because that ideology is the sole major cause of war in Europe and even the world. This argument is of course a reflection of the official stance of Britain and France, but can we blindly accept it as a reason to continue the war? No. Everyone has the right to support or oppose any ideology, but if someone opposes a certain ideology and uses it as a reason to massacre humanity, then its absurdity and senselessness are no different from the religious wars of the Middle Ages that massacred heretics. History has long proven that such ideological and religious wars only result in the massacre of the entire human race and the destruction of culture. No ideology can be destroyed by swords or flames. The world has the right to respect or hate Hitlerism or any political claim, but waging a war to 'eliminate Hitlerism' is a major political mistake. Until recently, the ruling classes of Britain and France have never shown excessive enthusiasm for bloodshed, especially for making any sacrifices for any ideology. History has proven that the opposite is true. Noble principles and ideas are often unveiled as a smokescreen for base and material desires. Even now, the so-called slogan of resisting Hitler's ideology or spirit is still difficult to say whether it is a smokescreen for the other desires of the ruling classes of Britain and France, such as consolidating their ruling position. On this point, George Bernard Shaw's recent article in 'New Statesman and Nation' is particularly noteworthy. Shaw said: 'The Polish war is over, Poland has failed, and we have no reason to continue the war. Therefore, we throw away the mask of the warrior and frankly admit that we do not care about Poland, but only aim to restore the original balance of power and destroy Germany. We now call this move the elimination of Hitlerism. If we win, Versailles will reappear, but it will be even worse, and another war will occur in less than twenty years. No matter how thickly we paint it with liberal democrats and all the rubbish that we ourselves have now abandoned, the reason for the war cannot stand. We can only make peace with Hitler and the whole world, and stop acting foolishly and destroying our own people.' Shaw's words are mostly true. In view of all the facts, the ruling classes of Britain and France are not at all concerned about the fate of Poland or liberating the German people from Hitler's regime. The two countries each have vast colonies. The British Empire has a population of 450 million, and the French colonies have 65 million people. Therefore, what other purposes can the British and French governments have for fighting Germany, except to resist Germany's demands and maintain this vast territory, so as to calmly exploit hundreds of millions of colonial slaves? Anyone who refuses Germany's peace proposal must bear the responsibility for the continuation of the war, and thus the enormous sacrifices and destruction of the war. War or peace? Those who shout the slogan 'fight until victory' advocate war and oppose peace, but who benefits from this war for world domination? The working class will never benefit. The working class will only suffer in this kind of war." (9th TASS Dispatch)

Rome: Rome broadcast today that Italy has not put forward a proposal for a truce, nor does it want to make a military move, but it will give spiritual support to any movement to end the war. (9th Reuters Dispatch)

Rome: The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia published an article written by Gayda, discussing Hitler's peace proposal, saying that for the sake of European civilization, Italy invites all responsible powers to face reality so as to rein in the horse on the edge of the cliff in time and avoid a major disaster. Hitler's proposal is not only limited to the proposal for a truce, but its purpose is to establish a new European order based on the unity of interests. The speaker said that Herr Hitler's proposal was vague, but it would be more true to say that this proposal has pointed out the path. The proposal is indeed not thorough and does not cover the final details, but this is not necessary today either. The principles of the proposal and the very complex causes of the current European crisis are in line with each other. The peace that can be gained on the Western Front after a long period of bloody fighting may not be much different from what Germany is proposing today. (9th Reuters Dispatch)

New York: The New York World-Telegram's editorial today condemned Hitler's "peace speech" as extremely absurd, saying that the more one studies this speech, the more one cannot believe that a civilized European power has such a spokesperson. Judging from history, such empty talk that has nothing to do with reality is rare. The wording is extremely arrogant, and the intention is even more absurd. One cannot help but call it neurotic. It is difficult to see any progress towards peace until Hitler is overthrown. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

### The United States is Inconvenienced to Mediate the European Situation, A Glimpse of American Newspaper Opinion

New York: American newspapers are generally unwilling for President Roosevelt to accept Germany's informal request and mediate the European war. The Republican New York Herald Tribune recently published an article entitled "The United States is Inconvenienced to Mediate," which stated that the United States is currently powerless to do anything. Those who hope that a major neutral country will come forward to mediate are trying to force the United States to collude with them. How can the United States fall into their trap? In addition, Britain and France are unwilling to make this clumsy move (i.e., requesting mediation). At this time, to take on the role of mediator is tantamount to intervening. If not, it is also inserting oneself into the situation. However, the American people are determined not to be involved in the conflict. The Democratic New York Times reported that according to German sources, people in the German government firmly believe that the proposals put forward by Hitler can be used as a basis for Britain and France or mediators to end the war. "This belief may exist, because Hitler has always underestimated Britain and France, or he hopes that this belief will have an internal effect, saying that the conditions put forward by Hitler are extremely fair, because if the war drags on, Hitler must use excuses to appease the people, and he has to make preparations in advance." (9th Havas Dispatch)

### British Public Opinion, Britain and France Must Expose Hitler's Strategy

London: The morning newspapers here are still studying carefully the speech delivered by German leader Hitler, saying that Britain and France will definitely reject the peace talks, but the strategy used by Hitler must be exposed and a counter-proposal must be put forward to answer it, so that the responsibility for continuing the war can be attributed to Germany. In addition, the newspapers attach great importance to the fact that the neutral countries are not responding to Hitler. The Times reported that "the authorities of countries in the Eastern and Western hemispheres proposed mediation to Hitler six weeks ago. At this time, Hitler is looking for a key person in the neutral countries who believes in the value of his peace talks to come forward to mediate, in order to end the war. However, the general public knows that this move will not succeed and are hesitant to act. Therefore, for the sake of the democratic countries, there is no other way but to strengthen the determination to eliminate the main obstacle to peace in Europe (referring to Hitler and his policies)." The Daily Telegraph also spoke of the silence of the neutral countries, and its conclusion was that the democratic countries should fight to the end. The News Chronicle reported that "Hitler stretched out his left hand to us in order to consolidate his victory, but we did not accept it quickly. He is very annoyed. His planned plan is not to fight against countries of equal strength, so he expects the neutral countries to act as mediators, but in terms of the conditions he has put forward, no one is willing to come forward to mediate, even Italy has no intention of doing so. Then his isolated position is undeniable." (9th Havas Dispatch)

### Norwegian Newspapers Advocate Mediation for Peace

Norwegian Capital: The Norwegian newspaper "Tidens Tegn" published an article today, reviewing in detail the German leader Hitler's parliamentary speech, and then published its opinion, saying, "If no one comes forward to mediate peace, the Norwegian Foreign Minister can take on the role of mediator and come forward to mediate European peace. We believe that Hitler's peace proposals, regarding the measures to deal with the future fate of Poland, as well as the colonial demands and the plan to rebuild a new European order, can serve as the basis for negotiations. The current difficulty is that no one is taking the first step to mediate the dispute. If President Roosevelt and Mussolini both have doubts, then the Norwegian Foreign Minister may as well try." (9th Huitong Dispatch)

### Italian Newspapers Attack Soviet Leaders

Rome: The Città di Padova newspaper recently published an editorial, vehemently attacking the leaders of the Soviet government, especially General Voroshilov, People's Commissar for Defense, saying, "General Voroshilov colludes with party members to control the Soviet Union, and wants to communize the whole world, so as to control it. A certain magazine in Rome actually praised this person in every possible way, which is wrong. In fact, Lenin and Stalin favored this person because he was an outstanding rogue and wanted to use him. We should completely ignore this person, his party members, and those who do evil in the Soviet Union, whether they praise each other or kill each other. We do not want to ask about them. The result of their killing will at most reduce the number of criminals in the world. A certain magazine that praises General Voroshilov exaggerates his deeds and forms a myth, which is even better than the Italian national hero Garibaldi. This is something that we obviously cannot tolerate. We have always been anti-communists, and we should always oppose communism. We will never add a gram of admiration or an ounce of sympathy to the Bolshevik party members. As far as we can see, these people are just pitiful clowns who make a living by mystifying, and their nature is cruel, and their bad deeds are obvious. They are the most insane and shameless liars and the most tyrannical and decadent thugs in history." People from all walks of life in Rome have commented extensively on this article in the Città di Padova newspaper. Foreign observers generally said that this is a disguised attack on Germany's current policy. Germany and Italy are going their separate ways, and the so-called Berlin-Rome axis no longer exists, which can be seen from this. (9th Havas Dispatch)

### France's Gold Reserves Total 5,000 Tons, Sufficient to Support a Long-Term War

Paris: The responsible authorities recently announced that France has a huge amount of gold reserves to support a long-term war, with plenty to spare. The Bank of France has gold reserves of about 2,500 tons, and the Exchange Equalization Fund has 500 tons. In addition, the funds deposited abroad by the French people are between 70 billion and 100 billion francs, equivalent to 2,000 tons of gold by weight. The above totals 5,000 tons of gold, and the huge amount of gold coins and cash held by the people in France is not included in the calculation. When necessary in the future, France can still obtain credit loans from foreign private individuals or governments. With regard to this, the financial agreement signed by Britain and France is sufficient to supplement the military and diplomatic alliance between the two countries. It is recalled that during the First World War, that is, between 1914 and 1919, France's foreign trade had an average annual loss of 13 billion francs, with a total of 65 billion francs in five years. Among them, in addition to 8 billion francs for merchant ship freight and insurance, 13 billion francs for foreign securities held by the French people, and 16 billion francs for the expenses of the Allied forces in France, totaling 37 billion francs, which could be used for subsidies, there was a real deficit of 28 billion francs, with an average annual deficit of slightly less than 6 billion francs. At the then exchange rate of the franc, 1,600 tons of gold were lost each year. Judging from France's current resources, the prospects for a long-term war are very optimistic. However, the French government does not intend to use its savings, but to maintain the normal state of foreign trade as much as possible. With regard to this, the situation is quite favorable. On the one hand, France's foreign trade recovered its balance last year, and until the outbreak of the war last month, it had turned into a surplus. On the other hand, Britain and France are strong enough to control the ocean, and France's foreign trade will not be hindered in any way. In short, France will use the foreign exchange earned from export trade to purchase military supplies, and use its national savings as a backing. (8th Havas Dispatch)

### Britain and Germany Consolidate Economic Fronts

Danish Capital: The Danish economic delegation that was sent to London nine days ago will return here this morning and will visit Danish Minister of Commerce Kjærbol to report on the results of the negotiations. (9th Huitong Dispatch)

London: Regarding the commercial negotiations between Britain and Belgium, the Information Department recently issued a communique stating that "the Belgian commercial delegation has made significant progress after coming to London to negotiate with the British authorities. The German radio station issued a message saying that the negotiations have broken down and that the purpose of the negotiations is to leniently inspect the merchant ships of a certain neutral country, all of which are completely inaccurate. In fact, the goal of the negotiations is to minimize the temporary adverse effects that the British lock-in policy may have on Belgium. The British government is willing to maintain the most friendly relations with Belgium, but all contraband goods destined for Germany, even if they pass through Belgium, will be intercepted. In short, after Britain stepped up the implementation of the blockade policy, the various problems it caused were extremely complex. It is not possible to find a solution in one fell swoop. Therefore, the Belgian delegation has recently returned home to ask the Belgian government for instructions, and will come here again in a few days." (8th Havas Dispatch)

Belgian Capital: The German side transmitted a message saying that the commercial negotiations between the British and Belgian representatives in London have broken down. Officials here recently firmly denied it, saying that the Belgian delegation returned home to report on the progress and ask for instructions because the nature of the negotiations was important. (8th Havas Dispatch)

Danish Capital: Representatives of the German and Danish governments conducted negotiations on the trade between the two countries here and decided to set the total value of Danish goods exported to Germany in the winter of 1938 at 95 million Danish crowns. (9th Huitong)

### Germany Unable to Purchase American Kerosene

Washington - According to a report submitted today by the American commercial attaché in Germany to the State Department, since the outbreak of the European war, Germany has been unable to import kerosene from Western Hemisphere countries such as the Dutch East Indies, Mexico, the United States, and Venezuela. As a result, Germany's four-year economic self-sufficiency plan will inevitably be affected and undergo changes. The economic agreement concluded between Germany and the Soviet Union is the first step in the alteration of Germany's four-year economic self-sufficiency plan. (United Press dispatch from America, 9th)

Berlin - The semi-official German News Agency issued a statement today discussing Germany's export issues. It declared that despite the British blockade during this war, German machinery, tools, semi-manufactured goods, coal, nitrogen, aluminum, and other items are still being exported to neutral countries as usual. Even fighter planes are being continuously exported to foreign countries in exchange for raw materials and food. (Haitong dispatch, 9th)

### German Warships Intercept Swedish Ships

Stockholm, Sweden - It has recently come to light that two Swedish ships, the "Freden" and the "Swangen," have been intercepted by German warships and forced to dock at the port of Kiel for inspection. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Copenhagen - The Danish newspaper Politiken reprinted a warning from the German Flensburg Daily opposing neutral countries' ships joining British and French convoys. It stated that if merchant ships travel under the protection of enemy warships, the rules of intercepting ships for inspection and not sinking ships without warning will not apply. This applies not only to enemy convoys protected by enemy warships but also to ships of neutral countries joining convoys. According to German prize regulations, neutral ships escorted by their own country's warships must not be intercepted and inspected. However, the convoy commander can be asked to provide guarantees and detailed information about the ships and their cargo. If neutral countries are willing to take the trouble of escorting their own ships and pay the costs, the German High Command welcomes it. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

London - Following the sinking of the Dutch ship "Binnendijk" in the English Channel this morning, the shipowner issued a statement to the press here, saying, "The 'Binnendijk' set sail from New York and traveled safely along the way. When approaching the British coast, nothing was seen on the surface of the sea. Unexpectedly, there was a loud bang and an explosion, and the ship slowly sank. I immediately sent out a distress signal. A nearby warship arrived after hearing the signal and rescued all the crew members." (Havas, 8th)

### Germany Launches "Propaganda Offensive" - Loudspeakers Installed Beside Cannons

Paris - Responsible officials have recently received news from the front lines stating that Germany launched a "propaganda offensive" yesterday. Large loudspeakers have been installed beside all machine guns and anti-tank guns in several positions on the Siegfried Line. When the artillery ceases firing, important sections of the speech delivered by German head of state Hitler in the German parliament on the sixth of this month will be transmitted across "no man's land" to the French army positions. Upon hearing this, the French soldiers found it amusing, considering the tone almost as comical as that of the famous French film star Fernandel. Soon after, artillery fire resumed between the two armies, and the broadcast sound was cut off. This is the first time Germany has used loudspeakers for propaganda. However, since the start of the war, many posters have been erected along the entire line, prominently displaying the words "Please do not shoot German friends." These posters have mostly been destroyed by French artillery fire. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### Finnish Representatives Arrive in Moscow - Soviet Union Demands Rights to Three Islands - Red Army Enters Estonia - Italy Safeguards Southeastern European Interests

Helsinki, Finland - The government has officially announced that the Finnish ambassador to Sweden, J.K. Paasikivi (former Prime Minister), has been ordered to go to Moscow to negotiate political and economic issues with the Soviet government. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Stockholm, Sweden - Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko recently told a Reuters reporter, regarding the Soviet Union's demand for three small islands in the Gulf of Finland and the Finnish government's decision to send former Prime Minister Paasikivi to Moscow to negotiate economic and political issues, "I am unaware of any land demands from the Soviet Union. We are treating this with a calm attitude. As for talks for the benefit of both countries, this is a very common thing." (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Amsterdam, Netherlands - The newspaper Het Volk recently carried a dispatch from its correspondent in Stockholm, Sweden, stating that the Soviet government is about to demand that Finland cede the Åland Islands, the port of Hanko (the largest port in southwestern Finland), and the island of Hogland (in the Gulf of Finland) to the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

London - Following the Soviet Union's demand that Finland cede three small islands in the Gulf of Finland, the Baltic countries are now paying close attention to future developments. These three islands are located 110 miles west of Leningrad. In 1788, Russia and Sweden fought a decisive battle here. Finland now intends to negotiate, so it has sent its ambassador to Sweden, Paasikivi, to Moscow to discuss issues of an economic and political nature. Paasikivi is Finland's most capable diplomat. After Finland's independence in 1918, he served as Prime Minister. In 1920, Paasikivi served as Finland's chief representative and drafted the Treaty of Tartu, which defined the Russian-Finnish border and ceded the Petsamo province on the Arctic Ocean coast to Finland. Observers generally welcome Finland's appointment of Paasikivi as special envoy, believing that the negotiations will mostly involve commercial issues, as Paasikivi is currently the chairman of the Finnish Foreign Trade Association and a prominent figure in Nordic economics and politics. It is said that Finland may ultimately agree to the Soviet Union's demands and cede the worthless islands to the Soviet Union. However, Finland's current attitude is quite firm. Finland is not a Baltic country but a part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, and its terrain is strategically not weak. Finland also has strong defenses. Sweden is also watching this matter closely. A critic told a Reuters correspondent in Sweden, "Germany has not demanded anything from us, but what will the Soviet Union do to occupy Finland?" (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Moscow - Lithuanian Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys, accompanied by Army Chief of Staff General Stasys Raštikis, visited Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov in the afternoon for talks. In addition, the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty has been ratified by the Supreme Soviet, which stipulates that the three locations of Liepāja, Ventspils, and Pitrags serve as Soviet military bases, where troops are permitted to be stationed. It is reported that the Soviet government is demanding an increase in the number of stationed troops to double the original number. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

Kaunas, Lithuania - Lithuanian Deputy Prime Minister Juozas Pūras, Commander-in-Chief of the Army Vincas Vitkauskas, and Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys returned here by plane from Moscow today, and a cabinet meeting was immediately held, presided over by President Antanas Smetona himself.

In addition, 8,000 to 16,000 Red Army soldiers will be stationed in Haapsalu and Kuressaare on Saaremaa Island, 4,000 in Paldiski, and 1,000 on Hiiumaa Island. Hospitals and hotels in these locations have been emptied to serve as temporary barracks. The route from the border to these locations will be guarded by Estonian troops to prevent conflicts between the Soviet Red Army and the people. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Rome - It is reported that Italy is actively working to protect its interests in the Balkans and the Danube region and to prevent German and Soviet expansion in the area. It is generally believed that Hungary and Romania's agreement to reduce border troops and Yugoslavia and Hungary's ongoing talks are signs of progress in Italy's efforts. Some believe that Italy is trying to eliminate differences between the aforementioned countries in order to form a bloc, with Italy as its leader. This bloc may take the form of an economic agreement, similar to the Rome Accords previously signed between Italy and Austria-Hungary. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

London - According to Rome Radio, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has declared to the Romanian ambassador to the Soviet Union, Gheorghe Davidescu, that the Soviet Union has no intention of invading Romania. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### Soviet Union to Annex Belarusian Territory

Moscow - Well-informed sources here recently stated that Soviet authorities plan to form a Soviet republic in the Belarusian region of northeastern Poland and include it in the Soviet system. The temporary administrative body in Białystok has requested all local temporary administrative bodies to send representatives to participate in a national assembly to vote on this matter. It will also decide to confiscate land and distribute it to the farmers, and nationalize all banks and factories. These temporary administrative bodies consist of one military representative, one Communist Party representative, and two representatives of workers and peasants. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Moscow - News has recently arrived here from Lviv (in southeastern Poland, the capital of the Ukrainian region) stating that representatives will be elected in the Ukrainian region within a short period to organize a national assembly. (Havas dispatch, 8th)

### Germans Sent Back Home from the Baltic States

Berlin - According to authoritative German sources, German nationals and German minorities in Estonia and Latvia will soon return to Germany to live. This plan was decided by the German government and the governments of those countries. The rumor that it was decided by Germany and the Soviet Union does not correspond to the facts. The special committee handling this matter will begin work soon. There is no similar arrangement between Germany and Lithuania. (Haitong dispatch, 9th)

Danzig - Reports indicate that Germany has begun evacuating minorities from Latvia and other Baltic countries. Many German ships are currently docked at Baltic ports. The first ship has already departed from Latvia carrying the first group of German expatriates back to Germany. It has now been agreed that not only Germans, but also Estonians, Lithuanians, and Latvians born in Germany, can apply for evacuation within 48 hours. Several ships have arrived at ports in Estonia, but the evacuation of German expatriates in Estonia has not yet begun. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Tallinn, Estonia - It is reported that two German ships, the Wardenburg and the Utrandeson, have arrived here to transport German minorities within Estonia. It is said that a German delegation has left for here to discuss detailed arrangements for the repatriation of expatriates. At the same time, there are similar activities regarding the repatriation of German expatriates in Latvia and Lithuania. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Berlin - Dogs that can be trained to relay messages on the battlefield are now being conscripted into the army. The authorities have ordered those who own sheepdogs or hunting dogs to report them from today. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### French Commentary on the Baltic Situation

Paris - According to the latest news received here, the Soviet Union's intention is clearly to completely eliminate Germany's power in the Baltic coastal areas and arrange everything to make it impossible for Germany to invade the Baltic coastal countries. As a result, the non-aggression pacts signed between Germany and these countries in June of this year are completely invalidated. It is reported that the Soviet government has consulted with Lithuania and asked it to allow Soviet troops to pass through the country in wartime. It is also rumored that the Soviet Union will demand the construction of a defense line near the German border in that country. In addition, there is a very noteworthy point: the Germans living in Latvia have begun to return to Germany. Although the Latvian authorities say that this move is because German head of state Hitler recently gave a speech advocating the exchange of minorities with Eastern and Southeastern European countries, in reality, these Germans began to leave Latvia the day after Hitler gave his speech. People generally believe that this move is stipulated by an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, intending to allow the Soviet Union to do whatever it wants in the Baltic coastal countries. The migration of Germans to Latvia dates back to before the 13th century and has always been the vanguard of Germany's eastward expansion. Now, their voluntary withdrawal shows that Germany has given up all hope in that area. As for Finland, according to informed diplomatic sources, although the country was not quick to accept the Soviet Union's invitation to send representatives to Moscow for negotiations, and even mobilized some reserve forces, it finally decided to send its ambassador to Sweden, Paasikivi, to Moscow. However, what demands the Soviet Union will make are still unknown. It is expected that the demilitarization of the Åland Islands will definitely be among the demands. This is not only a source of great anxiety for the Finnish people, but also for the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Paris - Today, Parisian newspapers strongly criticized Hitler's retreat to Soviet imperialism, saying that German policy is now continuing to be constrained by Soviet demands. Pertinax stated in the Ordre newspaper that the German government's order for the mass migration of German residents in Latvia shows Hitler's fear of Stalin. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### Internal Unrest in Yugoslavia

Belgrade, Yugoslavia - Since the Croats reached a compromise with the government in September of this year, the leader of the Croats, Dr. Maček, has joined the cabinet and holds the position of Assistant Minister. However, extremist elements of the Croat people do not agree with this and have recently repeatedly caused trouble in many parts of Croatia. Many police officers have been beaten and insulted. Croats and Serbs who support cooperation with the central government have had to leave the province and take refuge in the capital. Among them, the incident that occurred in the city of Garilovac in the province four days ago was the most serious. Many Croat reservists publicly held demonstrations after receiving conscription orders, refusing to obey the orders. The military police were dispatched to suppress them before they submitted, but it caused a commotion and many people were injured. According to subsequent investigations, this incident was purely caused by the incitement of Croat extremists, because that faction absolutely does not want to reach any agreement with the central government and calls Dr. Maček a traitor. Their intention is that the only solution to the Croat problem is for Croatia to declare complete independence and break away from Yugoslavia, even if the province is placed under foreign protection, like the Slovak Autonomous Region. They express great admiration for the notorious Yugoslav terrorist group "Ustaše" (members of the group assassinated Yugoslav King Alexander I in Marseille, France, on October 9, 1934). Regarding the agreement reached by Dr. Maček and the government, they said that the first consequence of this move was that the government summoned a large number of Croat reservists into the army and extended various military precautionary measures to Croatia. In addition, agitators of the Croat people are conducting propaganda in the countryside, falsely claiming that the central government wants to drive the Croats to fight against Germany. The refusal of reservists in Garilovac to answer the call for conscription used the phrase "the government wants to send them to the French front to fight" as a pretext, thus seeing that behind the scenes, they are actually being manipulated by German propaganda personnel. However, when the Italian radio station recently issued news about this turmoil, it was not without exaggeration. According to foreign observers, the number of dissenting elements among the Croats is actually very small. The leader of the Croats, Dr. Maček, still maintains great prestige in Croatia. Since the Garilovac incident, he has come here to discuss follow-up measures with Minister of the Army General Nedić and Minister of the Interior Mihajlović, and decided to take all necessary measures to inform the people of the government's decision to strictly maintain neutrality in the current war.

### Fierce Air Battle Between British and German Air Forces Over the North Sea - One German Plane Shot Down

London - Regarding the fierce air battle between British and German planes over the North Sea yesterday, the Ministry of Information has reissued a message stating that a total of two German fighter planes and three British reconnaissance planes participated in the air battle. The pilot of one of the British planes spotted an enemy plane flying at high altitude and immediately opened up the throttle, ascended to the upper layer, and strafed with machine guns. The enemy plane also returned fire with machine guns. Soon after, another enemy plane arrived, and two British reconnaissance planes quickly rushed to the scene, thus gaining the upper hand. One of the enemy planes was shot down into the sea. The remaining one, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, fled in panic. Two British planes were hit by several bullets, but there was no major damage, and none of the pilots were killed or injured. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

### German Troops Attack East Bank of the Moselle River - Repelled

Paris - General Headquarters issued Battle Report No. 69, stating, "Our army launched an attack on the east bank of the Moselle River today and was repelled. In addition, artillery battles occurred south and southwest of Saarlouis." (Agence Havas dispatch, 8th)

Paris - According to a dispatch from the Paris Matin correspondent on the Swiss border, a large number of German troops are concentrated on the right bank of the Rhine from Lake Constance to Basel. This large army will be used to support the offensive along the Rhine River from Basel to Strasbourg. This offensive will not be launched until the Germans have fully understood the results of their "peaceful offensive." At the same time, residents of all German towns and villages 16 miles behind the right bank of the Rhine have now been evacuated. Also, according to an article by Maurice Prax in the Petit Parisien, German troops have increased their activity on the Western Front. In the past 24 hours, German troops have continued to send out patrols to venture into reconnaissance in various areas. After one team was repelled, the second team appeared immediately. But there is no change in the battle lines. Prax believes that this activity may foreshadow a German offensive in the area north of Guenvillers. He believes that the German side is very willing to announce as soon as possible that German troops have entered French Lorraine. This offensive will cause battles along the entire line, and the German military actions will eventually turn into ordinary battles between the two sides' artillery emplacements. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

Berlin - The German High Command issued the following brief official report at noon today: (1) On the Eastern Front, the advance toward the demarcation line of the spheres of interest continues. (2) On the Western Front, there were only some small artillery battles. (3) The air force is limited to reconnaissance activities. (Haitong dispatch, 9th)

Paris - Responsible officials have recently received news from the front lines stating that scouting parties from the French and German armies were very active yesterday. Enemy artillery batteries also bombarded our heavy artillery positions. (Havas dispatch, 9th)

Paris - Today, the French military announced that there has been continuous activity of infantry, tanks, and artillery batteries in the Saarlouis area, Saarbrücken, and near the mouth of the Nied River. According to news received by M. Jean, German troops have switched to the offensive, but the scope of their activities is very small, apparently to capture French soldiers, probe the French High Command's military plans, and test French military strength.

### Germany Actively Fortifying the Belgian Border

Paris - It is reported that German troops are currently actively fortifying the border north of Luxembourg and along the Belgian border to Hochscheid. A small fort in one location has been rebuilt into a 300-foot-long concrete and steel-reinforced bunker with a steel turret housing a rapid-firing gun. Behind this bunker is a huge compressed gas storage tank, used to resist enemy soldiers breaking through the forward positions. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### Reconstruction Work in Warsaw Will Take Time

Danzig - According to a dispatch from the correspondent of the newspaper Narodowiec, Warsaw has been completely destroyed, and it is doubtful whether we can restore it to its original state. Reconstruction work will take time. At present, tens of thousands of residents are homeless and at risk of freezing and starvation. Many magnificent churches and palaces have been reduced to rubble. However, the former residence of the first Polish president, the late Marshal Piłsudski, Belweder Palace, was undamaged. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### New Subway in Berlin Opens to Traffic

Berlin: A new subway line, built at a cost of 173 million marks over five years, will open to traffic in Berlin today. Berlin has ten major railway stations, and this newly built subway can directly connect the transportation of the four major stations, making a significant contribution to the convenience of travelers. The construction of this subway line was a massive and difficult project because one section of the tunnel is over five kilometers long and must pass under three railway stations. The difficulty can be imagined. This construction project employed 1,200 workers, and the aforementioned tunnel alone required 2.8 million bags of cement and 100,000 tons of steel.

### Kung Hsiang-hsi and Chen Cheng Discuss the Future of the War of Resistance; Japanese Attempts End in Failure; Chinese Actions Should Be More Agile

Chongqing: Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi, the President of the Executive Yuan of China, stated today that our celebration of the Double Tenth Festival this year is particularly grand because, at the time we celebrate our National Day, the Japanese have suffered a major defeat in northern Hunan, while our army has achieved a great victory. As for the economy, Japan is also in a situation of inevitable defeat because all their attempts to seize our resources have failed. Kung also said that because Japan has failed militarily and economically, it has repeatedly tried to use political methods to achieve its goals, and thus there are various puppet organizations. However, these "puppet organizations" cannot represent the people of China and do not have the support of the masses, so it is difficult for them to achieve their intended goals. (Associated Press, 9th)

Chongqing: According to an essay prepared by General Chen Cheng, Director of the Political Department, to be published on the Double Tenth Festival, although the Japanese offensive almost coincided with the outbreak of the European war, China's strategy is still one of attrition. However, Chinese actions, at this stage, should be more proactive and agile than before. At the same time, the Chinese army on each front should adopt mobile warfare tactics. Even the victory in northern Hunan was the result of using mobile warfare tactics. The true meaning of this victory lies not in the ability to secure Changsha, but in the ability to inflict a serious blow on the Japanese army. General Chen predicted that "the war will become more intense in the future." Therefore, in the coming period, "China's war of resistance may become more difficult, but after this difficult stage, China will have the opportunity to achieve final victory." According to General Chen, there is no hope for a fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese war until the situation in Europe is clear. The Sino-Japanese war is a part of the world problem and is closely related to the European problem. In order to achieve final victory, China must maintain a strong military force in order to launch an effective general counter-offensive when the time is ripe. Finally, General Chen said that the pioneers who created the Republic of China had neither weapons nor funds, but they were able to overthrow the "Manchu Qing" simply because they had a "fearless revolutionary spirit." "As for us, whether in terms of military equipment or funds, we are far better than the pioneers who created the Republic of China. Therefore, as long as we continue to resist the war, the final victory will surely belong to us." (Associated Press, 9th)

### Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui Issued a Proclamation Yesterday; Implementing National Spiritual Mobilization; Striving for World Peace

Chongqing: Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui issued the following proclamation to the people of the country here today for the Double Tenth National Day tomorrow: "We have been resisting the war for three years. Our goal, as mentioned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, is to seek the independence and freedom of the Republic of China and international peace and justice. In terms of domestic affairs, twenty-eight years ago, we fought under the leadership of Premier Sun Yat-sen to establish the Republic of China. Twenty-eight years later today, we are fighting under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to defend this Republic. Although time has changed, our goal of struggle is the same, that is, to promote the realization of the Three Principles of the People by revolutionary methods. Although the enemy is extremely stubborn and brutal, we all have faith in the final victory, just as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, 'The importance of spiritual conditions in our war of resistance far exceeds that of material conditions.' In order to strengthen the internal unity of the country, we must implement national spiritual mobilization. In terms of diplomacy, since the Lugou Bridge Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has declared to the world that 'the Sino-Japanese war is related to all countries in the world' because the Japanese invasion of China violates the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the result is that the peace and order of the Far East and the world are completely destroyed. Japan has always advocated the 'Anti-Communist Group,' and has been doing so even more in recent years. At the same time, it claims to build a 'New Order in East Asia,' but in fact, Japan not only disrupts order in East Asia, but has also destroyed the order of the whole world. Before the Mukden Incident in 1931, all parts of the world were in a relatively peaceful, safe, and prosperous state. After the Mukden Incident, all countries in the world quickly prepared for war. The historical evidence of Japan's destruction of world peace and order is everywhere. We deeply hope that our friendly countries, which have given us great sympathy and assistance in the past, will pay attention to these facts and prevent Japan's aggression from expanding further. What I would like to point out here is that China, in the past two years, has spared no sacrifice and has struggled for world peace. As a result of its efforts to resist the war, it has exposed Japan's weaknesses. As Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in his speech at the Fourth Plenary Session of the National Political Council, 'The enemy has long been showing signs of fatigue, and its internal support is also empty. Therefore, from a military point of view, Japan has already been defeated.'" (Associated Press, 9th)

### Japan Plans to Sign Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union; Foreign Ministry Quietly Awaits Developments; Japan in Contact with Soviet Union Regarding Freight

Tokyo: When Germany previously signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, Japan regarded it as undermining the anti-communist goals of the Tripartite Pact. However, as of today, Japan is also planning to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Those who advocate signing a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union believe that after this pact is concluded, Japan can devote all its efforts to the war against China. They also say that since the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression pact with Germany, it can turn its attention to the East at any time and make things difficult for Japan. Therefore, Japan should seize the opportunity to conclude a non-aggression pact with it as soon as possible. However, many Japanese who dislike communist ideology and distrust the Soviet government do not advocate signing a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. These Japanese all believe that if the Soviet Union continues to aid the Chiang regime, even if a non-aggression pact is concluded with the Soviet Union, it will be useless because the purpose of the Soviet Union's aid to Chiang is to sabotage Japan. However, the Foreign Ministry is now quietly watching the development of the international situation in order to open up Japan's isolated position. According to a 1931 report, the Soviet Union once suggested to Japan to conclude a non-aggression pact. At that time, Japan rejected the Soviet Union's proposal outright. The reason was that since there was a Kellogg-Briand Pact, there was no need to conclude a non-aggression pact, and that there was no room to discuss a non-aggression treaty before various pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union were resolved. In 1935, when Hirota was the Foreign Minister, his attitude was even more resolute. Before the pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, such as the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the demarcation of "Manchukuo" and Mongolia, and the fishing rights in northern Sakhalin, were resolved, Japan had no possibility of concluding a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. (Associated Press, 9th)

Tokyo: Since the outbreak of the European war, due to the interruption of maritime transport, the export of soybeans from "Manchukuo" to Germany and Italy could not be started. As a result, the export of soybeans from "Manchukuo" will decrease by 70 million Japanese yen, which will be a major loss in foreign exchange income. Therefore, the South Manchuria Railway Company and the "Manchukuo Government" are in contact with the Soviet Union to find a way to transport the soybeans to Germany and Italy via the Siberian Railway in order to save this loss. However, according to merchants, although negotiations are in progress, it is questionable whether the Soviet Union is willing to transport such a large quantity of soybeans. Furthermore, it is also questionable whether railway transportation is worthwhile due to the long journey. (Associated Press, 9th)

### Internal Turmoil in Japanese Foreign Ministry; Nomura's Compromise Plan Rejected Again by Subordinates

Tokyo: The internal turmoil in the Foreign Ministry, which was caused by the Cabinet's decision to establish a Ministry of Trade, still shows no signs of an early resolution because the attitude of the staff of the ministry is still very strong. Last night, the administrative officers held a meeting to discuss the matter for a long time, and finally rejected the compromise plan offered by Foreign Minister Nomura, deciding to still demand the unification of political and economic diplomacy. Later, because the Foreign Minister claimed that if there was an alternative solution that would not prejudice the Cabinet's decision to establish a Ministry of Trade, he would be happy to consider it. Therefore, the administrative officers drafted a solution and submitted it to Foreign Minister Nomura at 2:00 a.m. today. However, it is still doubtful whether the Foreign Minister can accept this solution because it will ultimately overturn the Cabinet's decision. According to the Asahi Shimbun, some senior diplomats may step in to mediate, fearing that the affairs of the Foreign Ministry will be suspended. The Hochi Shimbun reports that the Privy Council attaches great importance to this matter and is gradually asking Prime Minister Abe and Foreign Minister Nomura about the legitimacy of establishing a Ministry of Trade. The Kokumin Shimbun reports that all embassies and consulates abroad support the claims of the Foreign Ministry staff and have sent telegrams to encourage them. (Reuters, 9th)

### Miscellaneous News of the War in the Chao-Shan Area; Japanese Army Secretly Transfers Han Chinese to Reinforce; Chinese Air Force Deploys to Assist in Battle; Mutual Contention for Various Points in Chao'an

Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese army has recently been making every effort to invade southern Hubei and northern Hunan. The Japanese army stationed in Guangdong was also transferred out last month, boarding ships at Huangpu and Nanao at night and secretly transported to Hankou, replacing them with puppet troops from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to fill the defenses in eastern Guangdong.

The Chinese Air Force's Condor Squadron dispatched bombers to the sea off Raoping Nanao on the morning of September 29 and turned to reconnaissance in the Haifeng Dapeng Bay area. Thirty to forty ships have been transporting military supplies there for days. Upon seeing the Chinese Air Force arrive, they scattered in panic, in a great state of disarray.

The war in Chao-Shan is becoming increasingly tense. The Chinese regular army is advancing towards Chao-Shan from Jieyang and Fengshun. After the Japanese army in Anbu, Shantou, was defeated in an attack on Sangpu Mountain on September 26, they moved troops to Nanao on the 28th, using warships to cover the attack on Tuolin Haishan in Raoping, and were again defeated by the local militia. They are still eager to try and attempt to land on the coast of Hailufeng to attack Jieyang Hepo and penetrate into Wuhua Zijin, in order to encircle the rear of the Chinese army in Chao-Shan.

The Japanese army in Chao'an City has been unable to break through for more than ten days because the land and water transportation on the tributary of the Han River and the dike road has been cut off. Various outposts around Chao'an, such as Zhugao Mountain, Bijia Mountain, Jin Mountain, Hulu Mountain, and the foot of Siwei Mountain, are full of Chinese troops, vying for the mountain top positions. The Japanese artillery on the mountain peaks fire blindly every day. Because the Chinese Air Force often bombs the mountain, Chinese plainclothes teams are now active inside and outside Chao'an City. Two Japanese army camps in Donghua Street, east of the East Gate, were burned down on the night of the 28th. At about 4:00 a.m. on the 29th, the warehouse built by the Japanese army in Xifeng Street, west of the West Gate, also suddenly caught fire. All the military supplies stored in the warehouse were burned. The Chinese daredevil team took the opportunity to rush into the Japanese camp, engaged in battle with the mountain patrolling Japanese army, and used hand grenades and broadswords to kill more than ten Japanese soldiers.

At 11:00 a.m. on the 29th, three Japanese planes flew to Chao'an City and dropped mail packages and dry food, and then flew to the mountains of Fengjie to spy. When flying over Fengkou, the Chinese army opened fire, and the Japanese planes also flew low and fired machine guns in retaliation. They held out for thirty minutes before leaving. When passing Sangpu Mountain, they dropped two bombs on the mountain rocks. It is heard that Heyuan was bombed by Japanese planes twice. Seven bombs fell on Zhongshan Park, and the losses are unknown.

### Chinese Army Reinforcements Attack Shenzhen; Japanese Bombers Fly into British Airspace

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Chinese army counterattacking Shenzhen began to attack the Japanese army in Shi'an late on the night of the 30th of last month. A previous dispatch has been recorded. The Japanese army in Shenzhen Nantou and other places stubbornly resisted. At 7:00 a.m. on the 1st of this month, the war was declared to be easing. During the fierce battle for two days, the Japanese army sent planes to assist in the battle, bombing the Chinese army's positions. The Chinese army launched a surprise counterattack. The areas along the coast of Houhai Bay from Shatou to Shatoujiao in Matu Bay were all destinations for their counterattack. The Japanese army stationed in the villages between Shatoujiao in Shenzhen is expected to have been completely wiped out. By the afternoon of the 2nd, the sound of artillery was heard again in the area along the Sino-British border. The sound of artillery was most intense between Shatou Shenzhen in Houhai Bay. The sound of artillery, machine guns, and rifles could be heard very clearly on the border of Hong Kong. The Chinese army claimed that the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in the battle on the 1st. The Chinese army once entered Shenzhen on that day, but withdrew immediately to avoid heavy losses because the Japanese planes were bombing. Most parts of Shenzhen were on fire.

At present, Chinese reinforcements are flowing from Huiyang to Shenzhen. Two Japanese transport ships are carrying Japanese soldiers, attempting to land in Daya Bay to prevent the Chinese army from advancing towards Shenzhen. In Nantou, the regular army has also joined forces with the guerrillas and is counterattacking the Japanese army. The contact between the Japanese army in Nantou and Shenzhen has been cut off. Japanese planes have been dispatched to assist in the battle for two days, but the sky is overcast and the weather is bad, making it impossible to detect the Chinese army's positions. At around 3:00 p.m. on the 2nd, a Japanese plane flew over the British airspace of Shatoujiao. The plane was dark gray with a red sun symbol painted under its wings, and flew low at an altitude of 400 feet. There were two pilots on the plane. After circling twice in the sky, it flew back to the Chinese territory of Shatoujiao and then flew towards Yantian.

### Chinese Army Launches Large-Scale Attack on Xicheng Counties

Fierce Battle Stopped After Four or Five Hours

Wuxi Correspondence: On the 5th of this month, the New Fourth Army and the 2nd and 4th Detachments of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army from various towns and villages in Wuxi Jiangyin counties, Zhutang River, Xiangqiao, Mazhen, and Meicun, attacked the Japanese troops of Shino, Miyake, and Kawashima in Xicheng counties. The two sides fought fiercely for four or five hours, from dawn to about 11:00 a.m., before stopping. The Japanese side also added the Yinshan artillery team, firing artillery indiscriminately. The battle line extended to Mazhen in the southern countryside of Jiangyin and Yanqiao in Wuxi. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 100 casualties, and the Chinese side also suffered considerable sacrifices.

### Wuxi Japanese Army Tries Air Raid Alarm

Wuxi Correspondence: At 9:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. on the 5th of this month, air raid alarms were suddenly heard near the Wuxi Railway Station and outside Guangfu Gate, four times in total. The people were horrified. After investigation, it was found that the alarm system was installed by the Japanese army in a silk factory and had been there for a long time. This was a test run.

### Guangdong Coastal Fishing Boats Devastated; From Late August to Mid-September; More Than 1,000 Fishing Boats Intercepted and Burned by Japanese Warships; Fishermen's Losses Exceed One Million

Shantou Correspondence: In recent days, Japanese warships on the Min-Yue sea have been moving towards the Huizhou coast. It is now the fishing season, and fishermen along the coast are forced to risk going out to sea to fish for a living. Many have gone and never returned. It is reported that from late August to mid-September, more than 1,000 fishing boats were burned, with losses exceeding one million. Off the coast of Tanganshan, Hong Kong, six fishing boats were chased by Japanese rubber boats a few days ago. The fishermen fought back with indigenous cannons, sinking three rubber boats and killing or wounding more than 20 Japanese soldiers. But later, several fishing boats were pursued and captured by Japanese warships and burned near the Wanshan Islands, and many fishermen were killed. Near Hongmeihai Bay, Shantou, there is a tragic scene of fishermen firing cannons to resist the war every day. There are often burned hulls and corpses floating on the sea.

### Japanese Army in Xuzhou Very Weak

Huaihai Japanese Army Retreats to Xuzhou, Pei County Armies in Large-Scale Mixed Battle

Xuzhou Correspondence: In recent days, the Japanese army in northern Huaihai has been retreating from the Hai Zheng Highway to Xuzhou, with as many as 200 people or as few as dozens of people every day, for a total of about 2,000 people. There are also prostitutes, children, furniture, and miscellaneous items, all taking the train in Xuzhou to Qingdao via the Jinpu Railway or the Longhai Railway at any time. The more than 20,000 Japanese troops recently stationed in Xuzhou were from the Washizu Division, which was withdrawn from eastern Henan, northern Jiangsu, and the Haizhou area, and was ordered in early September to be transported to Guanwai via the Jinpu North Road and Longhai East Road. At present, the total number of Japanese troops stationed in Xuzhou is no more than 2,000. It is also heard that the puppet troops in Xuzhou, led by Chen Ning, Kang Jintao, Hu Li, and Li Guanying, have been successively resolved by the Japanese army. At present, there are only more than 250 puppet "Suburban Republic Army Commander Liu Fulong's troops, who are stationed with the Japanese army in the eastern section of Longhai to maintain the road. The Japanese army in Pei County recently attacked without success and have fled back to their strongholds. County Chief Feng then sent Regiment Commander Zhang ×× of the ×th Regiment to lead three major battalions and one company of the training battalion to the southern section of the Pei Tong Road, taking the opportunity to attack the Japanese army, stationing in the third section of Tongshan District, Meicun Tongchang, and other places. At dawn on September 13, more than 300 Japanese troops from Zhengji via Maozhai took 18 cars and 8 tanks, and turned to Dongfu, dividing into three routes to harass. One route to the Chinese army in Meicun drove to Xindi. The Chinese army's sentry immediately fired to block their advance. Zhang, the battalion commander stationed in Meicun, also led two detachments to resist strongly. The Japanese army used tanks and machine guns to press on Zhang's battalion, with fierce firepower. Zhang's dog team retreated back into the village, occupying civilian houses. Taking advantage of the Japanese army's dispersal, they launched a heroic and bloody charge. Later, the Japanese army advanced from both wings, using chariots for cover and concentrating firepower, taking the village with a large encirclement. At that time, the situation between the Chinese and Japanese armies was quite different. The various units of the Chinese army stationed in Tongchang in the third section rushed to the rescue, breaking through the encirclement and retreating to Xuzhuang in Tongshan District. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered dozens of casualties, and Chinese officers and soldiers also made heroic sacrifices.

Education News

### National High School Teaching Staff Numbers (Part 1) Growing Annually to Over Eleven Thousand People, More Schools Reduced Than Increased During Wartime

(Chongqing Special Dispatch) The Ministry of Education recently compiled detailed statistics on the overall situation of teaching staff in specialized schools and above before and after the war. Excerpts are as follows:

Pre-War Situation

The number of teaching staff in specialized schools and above generally increased or decreased with the number of schools. In the first year of the Republic of China, there were 2,312 teachers. By the 17th year, there were 5,214 teachers. This was because there were only four universities and 21 specialized schools in the first year of the Republic of China. Although the number of specialized schools decreased to 25 in the 17th year, the number of universities increased to 49. Universities are more complex than specialized schools, and naturally require more teachers. From the 17th to the 20th year, the number of specialized schools and above increased from 75 to 103, so the number of teachers also increased from 2,314 to 7,053. Starting in the 21st year, restrictions were placed on the establishment of schools specializing in liberal arts, and the number of teachers decreased slightly as a result. After the 21st year, the number of students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine increased, and the number of teachers required for each subject also gradually increased. Therefore, although the total number of students was less than the number of students in the 20th year due to the decrease in the number of liberal arts students, the number of teachers still increased with the number of students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine. By the 25th year, the number of teachers had reached 7,560. The number of staff in specialized schools and above was not fully investigated before the 17th year. Since the 17th year, it has also increased annually. In the 17th year, the number of staff in specialized schools and above was 2,913, which increased to 5,421 in the 25th year. If the number of staff and teachers is combined, and the number of staff and teachers who held both positions is subtracted, the actual number of staff and teachers was 7,669 in the 17th year, which increased year by year to 11,850 in the 25th year.

Now, comparing the number of teaching staff and students each year since the 17th year, the number of teachers per 100 students was the highest in the 18th year, with 22 teachers. The 20th and 21st years were the lowest, with 16 teachers. The number of staff per 100 students was the highest in the 18th and 23rd years, with 13 staff. The 19th and 20th years were the lowest, with only 10 staff. If the number of teaching staff is combined, and the number of staff and teachers who held both positions is subtracted, and then compared with the number of students, the number of teaching staff per 100 students was the highest in the 18th year, with 33 teaching staff. The 20th and 21st years were the lowest, with 24. Generally, the number of teaching staff was higher in the 17th and 18th years. After the 19th year, the situation in each school became more stable, so the number of teaching staff also gradually decreased. After the 22nd year, the increase in the number of teaching staff was actually due to the increase in the number of schools and departments. In addition, for some departments that focus on research, although students are not enthusiastic about studying, the number of teachers in specialized subjects cannot be reduced. This is also a common fact. However, judging from the number of teaching staff per 100 students in the 17th and 18th years, the number of teaching staff per 100 students in each school in recent years is still decreasing, which shows that each school is now more careful in selecting and hiring teaching staff.

Wartime Situation

Since the July 7th Incident, specialized schools and above in Peiping and Tianjin were the first to be suspended. Only a few schools managed to move inland to start classes. Due to the expansion of the war zone, specialized schools and above in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai, Nanjing, Peiping, Tianjin, and other provinces and cities either moved inland or tended to be suspended. Because the schools themselves moved around, teaching staff were restricted by family ties and various transportation difficulties. On the other hand, due to the changes in the schools themselves, the number of teaching staff required changed. Therefore, the difference in the increase or decrease in the number of teaching staff in each school was very large. Regarding the number of teaching staff in specialized schools and above in the 26th year, based on the materials obtained, there was a significant change in the number of teaching staff in 70 schools, including National Central University, compared with the number in the 25th year. In the 26th year, the number of teaching staff increased in 17 schools, including National Sun Yat-sen University, Wuhan University, Hunan University, Sichuan University, Jiaotong University, Yunnan University, Shanghai Medical College, Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College, Tongji University, Guangxi University, Sichuan Provincial Education Institute, Private Sino-French University, Lingnan University, Fujian Union Theological College, Wuchang Central China University, Hwa Nan Women's College, and Tong De Medical College. Among them, the Sichuan Provincial Education Institute had the largest increase, with 70 teaching staff in the 26th year, an increase of 34 from the 25th year. The National Shanghai Medical College had 159 people, an increase of 72 from the 25th year. Yunnan University had 98 people, an increase of 40 from the previous year. As for the schools where the number of teaching staff in the 26th year decreased compared with the 25th year, there were 53 schools among the 70 schools investigated. Among them, the number of teaching staff decreased by more than seven-tenths in Jinan University, from 196 to 58 people; Shanghai Law School, from 49 to 10 people; Soochow University, from 89 to 23 people; and Xinhua Art College, from 57 to 12 people. The number of teaching staff decreased by more than two-thirds in Wuxi Chinese Studies College, from 34 to 10 people. In total, the number of teaching staff in 70 schools, including National Central University, was 9,241 in the 25th year, which decreased to 7,147 in the 26th year. The schools that increased had a total increase of 779 people, while the schools that decreased had a total decrease of 2,873 people. Comparing the increase and decrease, there was still a shortage of 2,094 people.

Judging from the number of teaching staff in 70 schools, including National Central University, in the 26th year, it can be seen that the number of teaching staff in public schools mostly increased. Of the 17 schools where the number of teaching staff increased in the 26th year, national schools accounted for nine, and provincial schools accounted for two. Secondly, the number of teaching staff in inland schools, such as Xiangda, Chuanda, Guid, and Wuda, increased more. This was probably due to the increase in the number of students in various inland areas and the fact that teaching staff moved inland to avoid the war. On the contrary, the number of teaching staff in private schools and areas in or near the war zone decreased compared with the 25th year. The reason for the decrease in the number of teaching staff in some private schools in the 26th year was actually due to economic hardship and a decrease in the number of students, and the hiring of teachers was inevitably tightened. This was not only the case for private schools, but some public schools in the war zone also dismissed teaching staff due to economic constraints. Observing the increase or decrease in the number of teaching staff in these 70 schools, it can be seen that the total number of teaching staff in specialized schools and above in the country in the 26th year must have decreased without a doubt. The impact of the war caused some teaching staff in specialized schools and above to lose their jobs as a result. Although the Ministry of Education had other relief measures for this, it was still an intangible and significant loss to the country's culture. However, in the 27th year, each school had settled down after moving, the curriculum improved, and the number of teaching staff gradually returned to its former state.

The 1939-40 Western Union Football League will open this Saturday. The opening match of the first game is Group A Lido vs. North Xitong, at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Lido is a newly emerging force in the previous season. Due to the articles of association, it was relegated to Group C, but in the Scott Cup, it became a dark horse and overwhelmed the crowd.

### Finance Although There Are Net Inflows, Foreign Exchange Is Still Oversupplied

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listing remained unchanged. The dark market for British and American exchange rates was as stable as it has been recently. Speculators are wary of the current market situation and dare not take any action. Most of them are waiting and seeing, and the factors affecting exchange rates are still only the actual positions of import and export merchants and foreign merchants. Throughout the day, the market opened strong, followed by Chinese banks offering more, which led to a loosening. Later, due to the net inflows from Forvourable on behalf of a certain party, the market tightened again. The British gold was 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate was 7.53125. Before long, Bi Bank came back to sell, and Sassoon and exporters also came to sell. At noon, British gold reached 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate loosened to 7.6875. In the afternoon, the situation turned dull. Only Chinese banks continued to offer slightly, which made the underlying trend stable. As a result, the closing prices were 4/51/2/2 and 7.65625, which were looser than the British and American rates on Saturday. The British rate was 0.0625, and the American rate was 0.09375, which was because the American rate against the British rate narrowed slightly. As for the futures trend, because the current environment is unfavorable, there are few buyers, so the loosening trend is more significant. According to the noon closing, the current month has already been flattened with the spot price, and the November rate has also been slightly flattened with the spot price. It is heard that someone is willing to pay a premium of 0.125 for American dollars, which amounts to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of only 1.63%. Trading was brisk in the morning and slow in the afternoon. Today is National Day, and the market is closed.

The Market Tightened Once Midway

In the early morning, there were no telegrams from London for large amounts of gold or American bank prices. The price of raw gold in London was stable. The exchange rates for British, American, Shanghai, and French currencies remained unchanged. The American rate against the British rate narrowed by half a point, fell by 5 points against Shanghai, and fell by a small half a point against French. The central listing rates for each exchange rate remained the same. Banks strictly opened spot selling prices: British gold was 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate was 7.59375, which were slightly looser by 0.015625 and slightly stronger by 0.03125 than the end of the previous week. After opening, the market continued to strengthen because Chinese banks came to offer. Chinese banks sold spot British gold to foreign banks and Huabi at 4/51/2/2 and spot American exchange rate at 7.625 and 7.65625. HSBC's listing was announced and did not move, and the balance tax on silver was also announced and did not increase or decrease. After that, Favouable Bank suddenly bought aggressively on behalf of a certain party, and foreign banks were less willing to supply, which caused the trend to tighten slightly. Forvourable Bank settled spot British gold with fellow banks at 4/51/2/2 and half a point, and spot American exchange rate at 7.59375 and 5625. Later, the American exchange rate was once called higher than 7.53125. Then, Chinese banks came to offer again, and Sassoon and exporters followed suit to sell, plus a certain American bank also had a selling interest, and Favouable's buying interest was sluggish at that time, so the situation tended to loosen again. Chinese banks, Sassoon, and exporters successively sold spot British gold to foreign banks such as HSBC and Huabi at 4/51/2/2 and 5625, and the spot American exchange rate rose from 7.5625 to 7.6875. At the same time, a certain bank also sold spot American exchange rate to Qian Duiye such as Wankang and Baocheng at 7.5625 and 625. Later, the British gold was once shouted as high as 4/51/2/2. At noon, the trading became slow, so the situation gradually leveled off. Until the noon closing, the spot selling prices of banks were: British gold at 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate at 7.65625, which were looser by 0.03125 and stronger by 0.0625 compared to the early opening.

Many Watched the Market Later

Due to the holidays, most operators watched the market. It is heard that Chinese banks continued to offer slightly, so the underlying trend was still extremely stable. Until the late closing, the spot selling prices of banks were: British gold at 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate at 7.65625. The current month's rate was similar to the previous price.

The November rates were: British gold at 4/51/2/2, and the American exchange rate at 7.53125. As a result, compared to the end of last week, the spot British rate was looser by 0.0625, and the American rate was stronger by 0.09375. The current month's British rate was looser by 0.078125, and the American rate was stronger by 0.125. The November British rate was longer by 0.09375, and the American rate was stronger by 0.125.

The Hong Kong Exchange Market Was Calm

Hong Kong, 9th Telegram: The exchange market opened calmly this morning. The British and Japanese exchange rates were unchanged. The spot American exchange rate was tighter by 0.0625, at 25.125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 4 yuan, to 326 yuan. At 10:00 AM, the American exchange rate loosened by 0.0625, to 25.1875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate continued to fall by 1 yuan, to 325 yuan. The market was calm. At 2:30 PM, the market opened smoothly with no changes. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by another 1 yuan at the late closing, to 323 yuan. The market will be closed for one day on Tuesday, the Double Tenth Festival.

The Tianjin Exchange Rate Continued to Rise

Tianjin, 9th Telegram: The exchange market opened with firm prices this morning. The spot British exchange rate loosened by 0.0625, to 3 pence 75. The spot American exchange rate rose by 0.125, to 6.375 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 1.5 yuan, to 117 yuan. The "Lianchao" dark market was cheaper by 1.5 yuan, to 87.5 yuan.

### The Gold Market Did Not Change Much

Yesterday's cash gold dark market situation only had half a day of trading. Because afternoon transactions are usually settled the next day, and today happened to be National Day, the industry temporarily decided to stop afternoon gatherings. The market will resume as usual on Wednesday, the 11th of this month. According to the market situation yesterday morning, there were very few changes. Generally, it fell first and then rose, but it was still slightly weak. It was entirely dependent on the loosening and tightening of foreign exchange and buying and selling. The market opened immediately affected by the loosening of the exchange market and fell to a low price of 4,030 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange market weakened. At that time, the Hong Kong group bought in, and it immediately rebounded to a high of 4,063 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange rate rebounded and hardened, and the securities group had a strong intention to sell, and it once again dropped slightly to 4,040 yuan. However, at noon, the Hong Kong group made a comeback and absorbed the market, which pulled the price up to 4,053 yuan at the close. As a result, it fell by 13 yuan compared to last Saturday. It is heard that there were some transactions outside the market in the afternoon, and the situation was slightly weak. A certain cash shop sold dozens of taels to a certain Qian Duiye on behalf of various parties, and the price dropped from 4,053 yuan to 48 yuan. However, observing that the gold price at the end of last week did not fall below the 4,000 yuan mark, it was entirely dependent on the support of the Hakka group, and it is heard that a certain agency also bought gold, so the future still depends on whether the Hakka group has the ability to continue. The half-day trading was still brisk, with more than 700 taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged, and the price of customs gold remained the same.

The Gold Dark Market Fell Only Slightly

Since the price of each tael (ten taels) in the morning was initially lower due to the weakening of the foreign exchange market, and there was a lack of buyers, the opening price was reduced by 36 yuan compared to the noon closing price on Saturday. Qian Duiye sold ten taels to the securities group for 4,030 yuan. After opening, the foreign exchange rate suddenly tightened and softened, and people's hearts were agitated. There were gradually more traders, and the price gradually rose. When it was about to return to the 4,050 yuan mark, the Hong Kong group suddenly started buying, and entrusted a certain gold shop and a certain Qian Duiye to search for purchases on its behalf, which made the trend even stronger. The price was also raised by 13 yuan. The silver shop group bought ten taels from the gold shop for 4,063 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate suddenly hardened again, and the Hakka group's intention to buy faded, and the securities group's intention to sell was strong, and the situation was again unsustainable. The price fell back by 23 yuan. The securities group sold thirty taels to the gold shop for 4,040 yuan. Near noon, although the foreign exchange rate was still reported to be hard, the Hong Kong group resumed buying, and entrusted a certain gold shop to buy on its behalf, which stabilized the situation. Soon, the price was pulled up by 13 yuan. A certain gold shop bought twenty taels from Qian Duiye for 4,053 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because today (that is, the 10th) is National Day, the market was closed for one day, and the transactions made by the industry in the afternoon are usually settled the next day. Because today happens to be within the holiday period, the industry temporarily decided to stop gatherings, and the market will resume as usual on Wednesday, the 11th of this month. As a result, the noon closing price fell by 13 yuan. The fluctuations in half a day were 33 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own gold was about 10 yuan higher than the gold dark market price. The buying price had to be reduced by about 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.

The Price of Gold Jewelry Remained the Same

Because the price of gold jewelry in silver shops fluctuated without much increase or decrease, the price remained unchanged all day. The price of Datonghang remained at the original price of 410 yuan, the price of Xinhanghang was the same as the previous price, and the buying price had to be reduced by about 20 yuan.

### Cash Floods the Market, Discount Rates Cannot Be Maintained

Yesterday's exchange and bill discount rate fell again. The initial price was slightly higher at 70 yuan per thousand yuan. Cash flooded the market, and the supply was eager. The price dropped to 65 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the price could not be maintained and once fell to 60 yuan. Finally, it rebounded slightly to 62.5 yuan, which was 5 yuan lower than last Saturday. The interest rate of the Qianye Guild remained unchanged. It is estimated that the early and late markets were still 0.19 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Fell More Than Rose

Yesterday, foreign currencies were mixed, because the industry's thinking was erratic, so the US dollar ticket price fluctuated quite suddenly. It initially traded at 13.43 yuan, then suddenly dropped to 13.22 yuan. Near noon, it rebounded slightly to 0.28 yuan, and finally closed at 13.3 yuan. As a result, it fell by 0.15 yuan. British gold tickets and American gold pounds also fell by 0.5 yuan each. Hong Kong tickets fell by 0.03 yuan, Annam tickets fell by 0.05 yuan, Canadian tickets fell by 0.4 yuan, Australian gold tickets fell by 1 yuan, Japanese gold tickets fell by 0.02 yuan, and Korean tickets fell sharply. The final price was 1.16 yuan, which was 0.015 yuan lower. Singapore tickets rose by 0.15 yuan, Dutch tickets also rose by 0.3 yuan, Robi tickets rose by 0.1 yuan, Philippine tickets rose by 0.25 yuan, and the rest remained stable.

### Bank Clearing House Reduces Exchange Rate

The Municipal Banking United Preparatory Committee issued a circular to all banks and firms yesterday, changing the interest rate, which took effect yesterday, and is set as follows: The interest rate on public bonds is 0.28 yuan in national currency, and the exchange rate is 0.23 yuan. The discount rate for acceptance of drafts with a 90-day term is 0.28 yuan in national currency, and the exchange rate is 0.23 yuan. The interest rate for interbank exchange is 0.23 yuan. The interest rate for interbank exchange loans remains at 0.25 yuan. The above is calculated per thousand yuan per day.

The aforementioned interest rate has not changed for two and a half months since it was changed on July 24. Yesterday, the national currency remained unchanged, and only the various exchange rates were reduced by 0.02 yuan.

### Bull Market in Securities and Domestic Debt: Strong Buying Continues

Class A Surges to $56; Jardine Matheson Shares See Speculative Frenzy

The securities grey market continued its strong upward trend yesterday. Even after the dividend distribution of Class C shares, the upward momentum showed no signs of weakening, trading significantly higher than the draw price. Various classes of shares all broke through the $1 mark, showing a positive trend not seen in the past two to three months. This surge has been sustained for several days, with strong buying pressure continuing yesterday. Due to the market being closed today, only half a day of trading was conducted yesterday morning, but grey market trading in the afternoon remained robust. Class B shares are expected to reach the $50 mark first, followed by Class C, D, and E. The soft gold and foreign exchange environment, coupled with the continued decline in premiums, naturally leads to a gradual rise in public bonds in such favorable conditions. This is anticipated, and it is possible that prices may return to pre-June 19 levels. In yesterday's trading, Class C shares opened slightly lower due to the dividend calculation, then gradually climbed higher, eventually breaking through $48. Market sentiment was very tight. Class A shares broke through $56. It was reported that they reached over $57 in the afternoon. The strong rise in Class A shares remains the most prominent. In the half-day morning session, prices continued to rise by 4.5 to 9 dimes, with total trading volume exceeding one million dollars. A brief summary table is provided below.

Stock trading saw 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange stock trade at a price of $40, up half a dollar from the previous day.

Furthermore, according to the Public Brokers Association, industrial shares in yesterday's stock market remained active and strong. Jardine Matheson shares were a major focus of public interest. Due to speculative fervor in recent weeks, the rise in this stock has been relentless, and its activity has not diminished in the slightest. In fact, it is intensifying, soaring to a high price of $50.50. At closing, bids were at $50.25, but there were still few sellers. Ewo Cotton Mill shares, which had been neglected recently, also saw a turnaround, with prices rising to $21.10. Other stocks saw little change. Rubber stock trading was sluggish and not worth mentioning.

### Piece Goods: Stockpilers Show Signs of Unease

Domestic Cloth

Recently, with the decline in yarn prices and the reduction in cotton cloth costs, factory prices have softened. Traders and stockpilers are showing signs of unease and are eager to sell their holdings. Coupled with cautious buying from customer groups, cloth prices have plummeted. However, popular goods and spring-selling fine yarn textiles remain stable in price, while trading in fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill is sporadic, with prices continuing to fall by one to five dimes. Local traders and wholesalers have taken advantage of the low prices to absorb some stock, with transactions including over 150 boxes of printed and dyed cloth, and nearly 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and twill. Although the prices of various types of velvets remain stable, customers are mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and transactions have also decreased to 2,000 to 3,000 bolts. New transactions with customers are rare, but orders for expedited processing remain strong.

Eastern Cloth

White fine cloth and fine twill continue to decline due to weak actual sales, falling by two to three and a half dimes per bolt. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is offered at $21.25, fine twill at $20.45, and both fine cloth and fine twill at $20.75. Trading houses have not been opening new orders. Local traders have traded over 500 pieces among themselves. The "Four Gentlemen" fine woolen fabric is also experiencing sluggish sales, falling to 6 dimes 7.5 cents per yard, and straight woven to 6 dimes 8 cents.

Exports

Today, 92 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong, 10 pieces to Beihai, and 3 pieces to Haiphong.

### Grains: New Harvest Not Yet Complete; Glutinous and Indica Rice Sales Stagnate

Customer Indica Rice Sixteen to Seventeen Dollars Lower Than Highest Price

Yesterday, inland sources brought in 4,000 to 5,000 bags of original packages by rail. The market opened early, and local merchants, seeing the market announcement that today is Double Tenth Festival and the market would be closed for a day, mostly replenished their supplies, so the market seemed to be gathering momentum. Kiln-dried Baige was quoted at $34 to $32.50, but actual sales showed little improvement, and prices weakened again. As a result, only over 4,000 bags were traded, and the prices of various grains showed varying degrees of decline. Broken japonica rice fell by about one dollar, Changzhou-Wuxi high broken quoted at $36-37, medium at $34, new japonica rice at $32, Suzhou-Tong broken at $32-33, new japonica rice at $30, Qingjiao kiln-dried green rice at $32-33, Fengjing Baige at $31 to $30, Nangang Hexia white rice at $30, early broken at $29.50, original package broken at $32, new Yangjian at $14, determined at $22.50, Lujian special at $25, determined at $23.50, Hexia goods at $22.50, generally 3-5 dimes lower. Various customer rice varieties depreciated by more than half a dollar, Jiangbei rice at $19 to $18.50, Lujian rice at $19.50, determined at $18.20, Qi rice at $17 to $16.80, Nanguan special rice at $20, determined at $19. Aged rice also softened by about 5 dimes, aged goods at $32-33, new at $29 to $28.50, special at $30.

In other news, stocks of customer indica rice are gradually increasing, and new arrivals are scarce, while shipments are continuously arriving at the port. The cost of Jiangbei new indica rice at the production area is currently difficult to calculate, and Wuhu indica rice is also difficult to profit from, but stockpiles are still large and will inevitably be shipped in gradually, so the market is continuing to trend downwards. However, local merchants, after a period of wait-and-see, have decided to buy at low prices, and trading is not quiet. Yesterday's market prices again fell by half a dollar to one dollar. High indica rice is only at $19.50, determined at around $18. Qi indica rice is at around $17, and coarse indica rice is at $16-17, which is sixteen to seventeen dollars lower than the highest price last month.

### Flour Market Quiet; Local Traders Focus on Warehouse Receipts

Wheat Flour: The spot flour market was very quiet yesterday. Second-grade flour mills are still holding onto their original prices of 70 dimes. Local trading is consistently sluggish. Due to the factory's urging to collect warehouse goods and requesting loss fees, customer purchases must be loaded immediately, so new transactions are even more difficult to initiate. Local traders are mostly focusing on warehouse receipts because the returned goods are cheaper than the factory price. It is heard that the prices of Lao Che Pai and Fuxin brands are quoted at 6 dollars 7 dimes 5-6 cents to 7 dimes, while the price of Bingshan brand is only quoted at 6 dollars 6 dimes to 5 dimes 5 cents. It is heard that the recent price of Japanese flour has even fallen below the 6 dollar mark in the spot market. Market prices are highly inconsistent, creating a chaotic situation. It is reported that 500 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong today. Today is the Double Tenth National Day celebration, and the market is closed for a day.

Wheat: The supply of wheat yesterday and the day before yesterday was not abundant, with only over 10,000 bags arriving. Traders are holding firm, and large merchants are waiting to sell at the warehouse, but factory demand is weak, making it difficult for the market to recover. The unified market saw only 4,500 bags of wheat purchased by Fufu and other factories for their Guan Dian, Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Danyang, Changshu, and Pudong branches, at a price of 9 dollars 8 dimes to 3 dimes 7 cents. The market remains lacking in momentum.

### Yarn & Cotton: Yarn Market Decline Intensifies; Three Reasons for the Sharp Drop

The yarn market continues its downward trend, and the decline is intensifying. This is mainly because actual demand is stagnant and strict exchange controls have been implemented in the South China region, greatly reducing purchasing power recently. At the same time, cotton prices have shown slight softening, leading to increasingly weak sentiment. The market supply appears to be slightly abundant. General speculative bulls, seeing the unfavorable environment, are painfully liquidating their positions, causing market prices to fall sharply. However, wealthy merchants with strong financial backing are still unwilling to release their stockpiles, and the situation is still able to support them somewhat. Today is National Day, and the market is closed for a day.

The morning opening for spot yarn was tight, and everyone remained cautious and inactive. Although asking prices were high, there were very few buyers. Market prices fell by $19. The spot price for Shuangma was $720, while warehouse receipts were only selling for $705. Although there was some support in the middle, the fluctuations were minimal, and the market remained sluggish and listless. At closing, the spot price for 20-count Shuangma was $718, and the warehouse receipt price was $701. It is reported that 715 bales were traded in the half-day session. The price of 20-count Shuangma fell by $11, Shuangqiu fell by $24.50, Tiannv fell by $19.50, and 10-count coarse yarn also fell by more than $10. Shenxin Factory opened 1,700 bales of 10-count red Shuangma, priced at $580. The amount of spot yarn purchased by various groups is listed on the left:

Traders: 525 Jiangxi: 40

Hong Kong: 60 Ningbo: 30

Inland: 60 Total: 715

The reasons for the recent sharp decline in the yarn market are briefly described as follows:

(1) Commodity prices in the inland regions have soared to their highest point. Cloth is closely related to people's livelihoods, so the Kunming authorities have already implemented controls.

(2) The Hong Kong authorities have strictly managed foreign exchange, and merchants are not allowed to remit funds abroad at will. Singapore and other places have also taken similar steps. As a result, purchasing power has been greatly restricted, which is a major factor in the lack of trading in South China. The price of 20-count Shuangma has fallen directly from $860 to $718.

(3) Since the outbreak of the European war, there have been few ships, and additional war risk insurance and water charges have been added, resulting in a substantial increase in costs. The converted price is particularly high. Therefore, the cost of yarn mills has soared. Although new cotton has entered the market in this country, transportation from all sides is difficult and it cannot be safely transported to Shanghai. Therefore, the opening price has gradually risen from $101 to $160. Recently, many people have been scouring for high prices in production areas and transporting them to Shanghai at risk. As a result, the arrival of goods has increased, and the market price has naturally declined, falling to $141. In addition, foreign exchange rates have been quiet and stable, with the British exchange rate often around four and a half pence. For this reason, general accumulated and suppressed positions have been actively moving and coming back to vent their frustration. As a result, the market has been unable to recover. What the future holds still depends on practical considerations.

### Continuous Supply; Tong Cotton Falls Again

Local cotton trading has become quiet due to the sluggish yarn market and closed factory demand. At the same time, the supply of Tongzhou cotton and Changyinsha cotton continues to be continuous, so the selling price has declined. Tongzhou cotton has fallen by another small 3-4 yuan. Local traders, seeing the above situation, have also remained inactive and have not purchased, so the volume of transactions has been greatly reduced. The supply from northern Jiangsu includes 2,092 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 1,120 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 620 bales of northern sand cotton. The current spot cotton prices are listed below:

New Tong Cotton: $141.00 Traders: 700 bales

Brazilian: $175.00 Traders: 200 pieces

In other news, spot cotton trading in Shanghai has been quiet recently because of the firm exchange rate, so everyone is watching the purchase of foreign cotton. Yesterday, White Lock cotton was only sold for $163 due to the large influx of Tongzhou cotton.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was fairly firm and quiet in the morning. Trading in the Far East was also good. Later, the market weakened as the Southern Gang aggressively sold short and bulls took the opportunity to close out positions. As a result, closing prices were down 2-3 points from the previous day. The Indian cotton market has been fairly active lately due to slight inquiries from the Far East. Yesterday, the forecast was up 2 rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 points. Liverpool was closed.

### Understanding Secondary Sexual Characteristics and the Onset of Puberty

— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School

When male and female children grow to a certain age, their testicles or ovaries begin to mature and discharge sperm or eggs. In females, this is the onset of menstruation, and in males, it is the occurrence of nocturnal emission. This period of maturation is called the onset of puberty. The timing of puberty varies depending on race, environment, etc. Saami people mature earlier, Europeans mature slightly later, tropical people mature earliest, and cold-region people mature latest. In terms of gender, the timing of puberty also differs, with females maturing earlier than males. On average, the onset of puberty for females is between 13 and 15 years old, and for males, it is between 14 and 16 years old. In females, ovulation ceases between the ages of 42 and 50, which is called menopause. Males, even at the advanced age of 60 or older, may still be able to ejaculate. This depends on the quality of hygiene during puberty. Some people experience a decline in their ejaculation function before middle age, which is due to promiscuity and masturbation during puberty, leading to premature sexual decline.

When males and females reach puberty, their genitals undergo significant changes. Genitals that have been dormant since birth begin to awaken, like dormant insects encountering the warm spring sun. The entire genital area becomes congested and increases in size. Males experience erections and nocturnal emissions, while females begin to menstruate. In fact, not only do the genitals change, but the entire body and mind of both sexes also undergo special changes. The general term for these changes is "secondary sexual characteristics." Human beauty and feminine beauty both originate from secondary sexual characteristics.

Puberty is also the most dangerous period in our lives, because young people are often driven by physiological impulses and experience heightened sexual desire, leading to various behaviors that harm the body and mind. If they engage in promiscuity and masturbation, their essence and blood will be depleted, leading to nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, weak brain, and kidney deficiency, which will erupt one by one. For the sake of health, they should take German testicular essence preparation for men called "Boti Kang" to replenish it, which functions to nourish blood and produce essence, strengthen the brain and fortify the kidneys. Long-term use can rejuvenate. Boti Kang is truly made by extracting testicular essence from young animals and mixing it with brain-nourishing phosphorus, so it has a great and comprehensive nourishing power. The female version has menstruation-regulating seeds, which can treat anemia and infertility.

Venereal Disease

### How Can Gonorrhea Be Conquered?

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

There are many treatments for gonorrhea, including injections, electrotherapy, and instruments, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, and none can be considered a complete treatment. Most doctors also pay attention to oral medications, because they are convenient to use. If they are effective, they will be a powerful tool for conquering gonorrhea. Other treatments often require a doctor to administer them, so their effectiveness is not widespread. However, oral medications with proven effectiveness are rare. Although there is a transdermal sterilization therapy recently, it only works on a local area and cannot be regarded as a radical cure. Recently, a leukocyte therapy has become very popular in medical circles in various countries, and its miraculous effects are astounding. According to its theory, it increases the number of leukocytes, which greatly increases the power to phagocytize bacteria and resist gonorrhea. As a result, gonorrhea bacteria, no matter where they are lurking or residing in the blood, are completely eliminated, and all stubborn gonorrhea cases are completely victorious and cured.

Based on this theory, Dr. Peter of Germany has mixed protein bodies and yellow pigments to create a medicine called "Kelinong." After taking it, it can boost leukocytes to enhance the power to resist gonorrhea and kill bacteria, thereby achieving a radical cure. All acute and chronic gonorrhea cases can achieve special effects after taking this medicine and be gradually eliminated. The success rate of treatment is consistently over 98%, so the medicine "Kelinong" is appreciated by doctors in various countries.

Since returning to the country after studying in the United States, I have paid close attention to the treatment of gonorrhea. Among the oral medications that have had special effects, only "Kelinong" is worthy of praise. In acute gonorrhea, it can have the effect of resisting gonorrhea, relieving pain, and promoting urination in a short period of time. In chronic gonorrhea, "Kelinong" can completely eliminate the gonorrhea bacteria hidden in the deep parts of the body. This is different from the general surface and local transdermal sterilization therapies, and it is also the most effective weapon to conquer gonorrhea.

### Conditions for Radically Curing Lung Disease

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Because health knowledge is not widely available in this country, many people contract lung disease as a result. Because this disease is extremely persistent, it has left a negative impression that lung disease is difficult to cure. In fact, this kind of wrong idea must be eliminated, so as not to be captured by the disease demon. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as the average doctor says, and on the contrary, lung disease can be cured in every case, as long as treatment and recuperation are done properly, there is nothing else mysterious about it. This is what I have learned from more than 20 years of experience. I always use the medicine "Bofei Naer" to nourish the lungs, relieve coughs, eliminate phlegm, and fill the cavities in the lungs. No matter how severe the bleeding is in the second or third stage of the disease, it can be absolutely cured by taking it. However, during the healing period, it is advisable to be quiet and not to exert oneself, and to consume more nourishing foods, which are the necessary conditions for the lung disease to be cured.

### Comparison of the Harms of Masturbation and Fantasy

— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Masturbation is an unnatural action, which is to rub the external genitalia with the hands or other objects to achieve sexual pleasure and ejaculation. Fantasy is also an option, which is to consciously induce sexual imagination and illusory pleasure, in order to obtain ejaculation or sexual satisfaction. Masturbation can occur in children as young as eight or nine years old, while fantasy mostly occurs in adults, because children's imagination is not yet fully developed, so they cannot perform this unnatural mental self-abuse. In young people, the two can also occur together, such as fantasy first, followed by masturbation. The harms of the two can be said to be equal, or fantasy is worse, because fantasy is purely mental imagination, and if the mind is subjected to this unnatural stimulation for a long time, it is very easy to develop neurasthenia and other mental illnesses.

Whether it is self-abuse or fantasy, if it is done to excess, it will cause brain drain, mental exhaustion, poor development, and even atrophy of reproductive function, such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and infertility. If this happens, health will be lost and life will be at risk. In order to remedy this, young people's masturbation and fantasy should be stopped immediately. Those who have nocturnal emissions should stop them quickly. The most effective medicine is to take German nocturnal emission medicine "Nairisi Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and nourish the brain, so that sleep is comfortable and nocturnal emissions can be avoided. At the same time, take German testicular essence preparation for men "Boti Kang" to replenish losses and promote development. Both medicines taken together will be effective quickly.

Gonorrhea Forum

### Eradicating Stubborn Gonorrhea Bacteria

— Written by Physician Yao Ju Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road, No. 9

Gonorrhea is a very stubborn and difficult to cure venereal disease. It is easy to contract and difficult to cure, so it is widely spread. The reason why it is difficult to cure is mostly because the patient and the doctor cannot understand the condition and blindly suspect that their own disease has been cured. To be sure that the discharge is clear is a decision that will cause problems. It turns out that the gonorrhea bacteria are so small that they cannot be detected with the naked eye. Generally, once the acute stage of gonorrhea has passed, the secretion will decrease, but this should not be regarded as a sign that the gonorrhea is gradually healing. In fact, this is a kind of transformation of gonorrhea? That is, when people are negligent, the gonorrhea bacteria lie dormant and wait for an opportunity to move. Whenever the patient exerts himself, or engages in sexual activity, the urine will become cloudy again, and the gonorrhea will drip like floating catkins again. The changes in the disease are unpredictable, so chronic prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, and orchitis. Cystitis, etc., are all due to the patient and doctor's mistreatment and delay. Now, if you want to fundamentally eliminate this gonorrhea bacteria, you must thoroughly treat it and not be successful. You must implement a policy of eradicating the poison completely. If you still use palliative treatment of treating it as it comes and going or local surgery, there is absolutely no hope of a radical cure. For the past 20 years, I have tried all kinds of medicines and methods for the treatment of gonorrhea, and the fundamental solution for gonorrhea, once and for all, is to implement German static electricity therapy and take the gonorrhea sacred medicine "Kelinong". Because "Kelinong" can resist and kill gonorrhea bacteria in the deep parts, and static electricity therapy has the great effect of making "Kelinong" quickly exert its bactericidal effect and thoroughly eradicating gonorrhea bacteria in the superficial mucosa and other places. Once cured, there will never be a recurrence. Consultation hours: 10 am to 6 pm every day, sending out 20 numbers per consultation, each number costs only 5 dimes and includes a copy of the "Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" worth one yuan.

### Telegram Congratulating Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on Victory; Shanghai Celebrates National Day; Cold Weather Clothing Donation Exceeds 100,000 Yuan; Concession Authorities Implement Temporary Security Measures

City Adorned with Flags, Hearts Uplifted

Today is the National Day of the Republic of China. The entire city is closed for the holiday, celebrating with fervor. Donations for cold weather clothing are pouring in from all sectors. Various organizations are sending telegrams to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express respect and offer comfort. The concession authorities are implementing temporary security measures. Details are as follows:

Hanging Flags and Taking Holiday, Expressing Celebration Together

All sectors of the city are celebrating National Day today. In these extraordinary times, following orders, no extravagant celebrations are being held. Instead, flags are displayed throughout the city for one day. Government agencies, organizations, schools, banks, money exchanges, major companies, and businesses are taking a holiday as usual to express their celebration together. The citizens of the city are particularly excited this National Day, coinciding with the great victory in Northern Hunan, which marks a turning point towards victory in the war. Therefore, their hearts are uplifted and their spirits are high, and their belief in the ultimate victory of the war of resistance and the inevitable success of nation-building is further strengthened.

Cold Weather Clothing Donation Reaches 100,000 Yuan

The National Cold Weather Clothing Donation Campaign Committee has set a goal to collect three million items of cold weather clothing this Double Tenth Festival. In Shanghai, a Cold Weather Clothing Donation Committee has been established to raise 200,000 yuan in donations. In recent days, various industry groups and schools have been actively soliciting donations. In the wake of the exhilaration following the great victory in Northern Hunan, the citizens of Shanghai are enthusiastically donating cold weather clothing. It is reported that nearly 100,000 yuan has been raised as of yesterday. It is expected that donations will be even more enthusiastic today. Furthermore, many citizens are voluntarily submitting their cold weather clothing donations to designated national banks for collection. The various banks are working diligently. In addition, charitable organizations are expanding their disaster relief efforts and plan to send representatives to visit and comfort refugees in shelters today.

Telegram to Chairman, Offering Comfort and Respect

Various organizations in Shanghai sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek yesterday to offer comfort and express respect on the occasion of National Day and the great victory in Northern Hunan. The telegram read: "To Chairman Chiang, Military Affairs Commission, and all frontline soldiers: Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, for two years, thanks to your wise leadership and the courageous efforts of our soldiers, the Japanese have suffered severe setbacks, sinking deeper and becoming unable to extricate themselves. Good news has been frequently received in recent days. Another great victory has been announced in Northern Hunan. Upon hearing this news, we are deeply moved and inspired. We hope that you will continue to press on and fulfill your mission. The citizens of Shanghai are determined to uphold the wise teaching of 'do not be arrogant in victory, do not be discouraged in defeat', and with unwavering will, support the national policy and remain steadfast to the end. We send this telegram to express our respect. We humbly request your consideration."

Concession Authorities Implement Security Measures

The police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, considering that today is the National Day of the Republic of China and many businesses are taking a holiday to celebrate, resulting in crowded public places and bustling urban areas, fear that some may take advantage of the opportunity to cause disturbances. Therefore, after consultation, they have decided to implement security measures for one day. Along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, unnecessary roads and lanes will be blocked off, following past security procedures. Red security vehicles and armored cars will be dispatched to patrol the roads, inspecting vehicles and pedestrians, to ensure the safety of the concessions.

Special Letter of Comfort to City Boy Scouts

The 50th Shanghai Boy Scout Troop has been providing outstanding wartime service. On the occasion of National Day, the sponsoring organization of the troop sent a special letter of comfort. The letter stated: "We hereby inform you that members of the troop have been serving in the rear of the military for over two years, traversing mountains and rivers, enduring hardships. Many have died in the line of duty or suffered injuries. They have fulfilled the mission of youth and lived up to expectations. On this National Day, we remember all the members who have left their hometowns and are serving faithfully, and we deeply commend them. The troop should send letters to all members stationed outside to inform them so that they may be further inspired and strive for a bright future. This is of utmost importance."

Appeal to Compatriots from Relief Committee

The Shanghai Thrift and Disaster Relief Committee issued an appeal to compatriots today, stating: "Our committee initiated thrift and disaster relief efforts on the Double Tenth Festival last year. Thanks to the enthusiastic participation and tireless fundraising efforts of shop employees, factory workers, young students, and housewives, a total of 100,000 yuan was collected. The funds already submitted to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association have been sent in eighteen batches, totaling 85,000 yuan. Considering that previously, every two yuan provided one month's worth of food for a refugee, then 42,500 refugees were able to survive because of this. Even if we calculate based on the current rate of four yuan per refugee, there are still 21,000 refugees. By curtailing our own sensory pleasures and desires, we are providing for the food and clothing needs of our compatriots. This cultivates the virtues of frugality and expresses the compassion of our hearts. This is truly 'loving each other and benefiting each other'. Currently, over five hundred comrades are still contributing thrift funds every month, persevering and remaining consistent. This sentiment and this determination are admirable and praiseworthy. However, with the current rise in prices, relief is more urgent than ever. On this anniversary of our thrift and disaster relief efforts, coinciding with the National Day of the Republic of China, we dare to once again sincerely appeal to our compatriots: please use your enduring strength to complete this great undertaking. Those who have already been contributing monthly payments should continue to do so. Those who have agreed to contribute but have not yet done so, those who have contributed but have stopped, or those who support the cause but have not agreed to contribute, are all requested to assess their circumstances and make their contributions accordingly. The amount is not important; many grains of sand will form a pagoda, and regular monthly contributions will sustain us through the coming year. In this way, we can do our best to save ourselves and save others. There is no greater good. We respectfully ask for your consideration."

Japanese Apprehension, Feeling Threatened

The situation in the outskirts of Shanghai is quite tense. Japanese troops and puppet "police" have been ordered to strengthen their defenses. The reason is that the National Day of China is approaching, and the recent victory in the great battle of Northern Hunan has sent shockwaves throughout the occupied territories. Guerrilla forces in the suburbs have also responded, posing a significant threat to Japanese strongholds. Starting yesterday morning, Japanese troops and puppet "police" have been tightening their checks on civilians entering and exiting, and conducting house-to-house searches at any time. The populace is alarmed multiple times a day. In the western part of Shanghai, residents have been hearing machine gun fire for as long as an hour at a time, once or twice a day, for the past three days. Furthermore, the commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai, fearing that the Chinese troops lurking in various locations may take the opportunity to attack on today's Double Tenth Festival, has dispatched over three hundred additional Japanese soldiers to Minhang in western Shanghai, a key transportation hub for Shanghai-Hangzhou waterways and land routes, to step up defenses. At 3:00 PM yesterday, three shallow-water naval vessels were sent to patrol the waters from Longhua Wharf to Minhang.

### Lottery for Redemption of Type C Bonds of the Unified Public Debt Held Yesterday Morning; Eight Bonds Redeemed for 2.8 Million Yuan; Payment to Begin on January 31st of Next Year

The eighth lottery for the redemption of Type C bonds of the Unified Public Debt of the Republic of China, issued in 1936, was held at 9:00 AM yesterday. Fan Jietang of the National Debt Fund Management Committee, Pei Yunqing of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Wang Boyuan of the Banking Association, Shen Jingke of the Money Exchange Association, Hu Chao of the First Special District Court, Wang Lin of the Central Bank, Tang Yusun of the Bank of China, Fan Chuchen of the Bank of Communications, and others were present.

The payment of the principal and interest of the winning bonds is scheduled to begin on January 31, 1940. The method of redemption and interest payment will be stipulated and announced by the Ministry of Finance at that time.

### Rebuilding the Moral Movement; Broadcasting and Speech

Promoting Spiritual Morality, Creating Sound Personalities

At 7:30 PM last night, the Rebuilding the Moral Movement broadcasted on XMHD radio station on Museum Road. Speakers included Tang Minghe, Professor Hu Zuyin of Shanghai University, Ms. Wang Hengren, a student, Ge Jialiang, a student of Zhejiang University, and Zhou Qingsheng, among others. Mr. Tang began by stating that in April of this year, twenty-five universities from various European countries gathered in Switzerland. After the meeting, they issued a declaration stating that the world's problem lies in how to restore spiritual morality, and that the purpose of education must be to create sound personalities and cultivate moral leaders to be pioneers in creating a new world culture. Professor Hu of Shanghai University elaborated in detail on his personal thoughts on rebuilding morality, saying that professors must not only be responsible for promoting the intellectual development of students but also help students develop perfect personalities. He proposed three implementation methods, hoping that schools can actively promote them: (1) Professors should stay at school for one or two hours each day to have personal conversations with students; (2) Professors should try their best to solve various difficult problems in students' lives; (3) Implement a mentor system. Mr. Zhou, who used to work in rural North China, vehemently opposed religion and morality during his student days, believing that they were tools used by the wise to bind the foolish. Later, witnessing the injustice of society, he advocated for social reform, but what he believed in could not solve the problems of society. After witnessing the Rebuilding the Moral Movement, he suddenly realized that social reform cannot succeed unless it starts with the reform of individuals. His words serve as a guideline for those who advocate "social transformation." Ge of Zhejiang University and Ms. Wang of Shanghai University both said that the Rebuilding the Moral Movement can provide accurate answers to personal, social, and global issues and testified with their own changes after recognizing the Rebuilding the Moral Movement. They hope that all students in the city can participate in the Rebuilding the Moral Movement and accept the four standards of Christ's sincerity, purity, altruism, and universal love to fulfill the mission of "new people," "new country," and "new world."

### Japanese Troops Conduct House-to-House Searches Near Yidingpan Road

Two Japanese People Broke into a Private Girls' School Yesterday; After Much Disturbance, Eight Constables from the Concession Were Finally Arrested

At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, eight Japanese military police and more than ten puppet police officers suddenly arrived at Lane 637 and Lane 638 on Yidingpan Road in a truck. They immediately guarded the entrance of the lane, prohibiting people from entering and leaving, and conducted house-to-house searches. As a result, nothing was found. The reason for the search is unknown. Residents, not knowing the truth, were all frightened.

At 10:40 AM yesterday morning, two Japanese men in Western-style clothing, holding a bundle of documents, suddenly broke into the Shanghai Private Girls' Middle and Elementary School at the intersection of Rue Lafayette and Avenue Saussaye in the French Concession, entered the office, and tried to sell maps to the school. Since the faculty and staff were holding a faculty meeting upstairs, the school servants politely refused. The two Japanese men became aggressive and caused much disturbance. Seeing that they were unreasonable, the school telephoned the police station to report the incident. After a while, the police station sent one Western detective and two Chinese constables to persuade them to leave the school. The Japanese men remained firm and refused to listen to the advice, seemingly deliberately looking for trouble. The detectives and constables then took them to the police station for questioning.

### Continued Printing of 500,000 Fen Coins; Contract Signed; Industry Associations Exchange Fen Coins; Accommodation for Amounts over 100 Yuan

After the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank issued one-fen and five-fen coins, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stated that since their issuance, very few coins have been circulating in the market, making it still difficult to meet the needs of various sectors for small change. According to letters from the New Medicine Industry, Sauce and Pickles Industry, and Coal and Charcoal Industry Associations, the Central Bank's Shanghai branch has been instructed to accommodate industry associations holding over 100 yuan in legal tender who wish to exchange them directly, to facilitate circulation. Furthermore, according to information obtained yesterday by a reporter from the New Sound Society from the banking sector, the Central Bank, in order to meet the actual needs of the Shanghai market, has decided to entrust the American-owned Yong Ning Company with the continued printing of 500,000 yuan in fen coins. The head office has instructed the Hong Kong office to sign a printing contract with the Yong Ning Company in Hong Kong. Once printing is completed, they will be transported to Shanghai for distribution by the Shanghai branch.

### North of the Suzhou Creek; British Troops Strengthen Defenses; Customs Police Station Increases Number of Detectives and Patrols; Japanese Troops Strictly Check Passports, One Chinese Person Detained

Today is National Day. The British troops on the British-Japanese defense line in District A north of the Suzhou Creek strengthened their defenses starting yesterday. The Customs Police Station also dispatched more police to step up patrols. The work is particularly tight. Plainclothes Japanese personnel are constantly moving about. At the two gaps in North Jiangxi Road, Japanese troops strictly checked Chinese passersby. Yesterday, one man was detained by Japanese troops for losing his passport. Details are as follows:

British Troops on District A Boundary Step Up Security

The British military authorities in Shanghai, considering that today is the Chinese National Day and fearing that lawless elements may take the opportunity to cause trouble, are determined to carry out security work in their defense zone to maintain order. In addition to issuing orders to the departments and subordinates in the various defense zones in Shanghai to pay attention to security, they also dispatched more than ten Scottish soldiers in military vehicles to the defense post at the Qianye Guild Hall on North Henan Road yesterday to strengthen defense forces. Late at night, they were deployed along the road to maintain security in the area.

Customs Police Station Intensifies Patrols

Although the British and Japanese defense zones in District A have changed, all police powers west of North Jiangxi Road still belong to the Haining Road Customs Police Station. Yesterday afternoon, the police station dispatched Chinese and Western patrol officers to patrol along the road. Patrol officers were stationed at every intersection and increased patrols at both ends of the North Jiangxi Road Bridge, as if the defense zone had not changed. The patrol work was particularly tight, indicating that the police station did not take the police powers in District A lightly.

One Chinese Detained

A reporter from Da Guang She went to District A for inspection yesterday afternoon. When he arrived near the gap in Haining Road, he saw a man and a woman coming from Hongkou who intended to walk out of the gap. The Japanese troops asked to inspect their passports. Because the man only had the passport cover and did not know when he lost the passport, he was very panicked. He pleaded with the Japanese troops, but to no avail, and was detained. After more than an hour, he had not been released. The outcome is unknown.

Three Household Surveys, Situation Tense

The Japanese troops in District A have been sending plainclothes Japanese soldiers to inspect pedestrians outside the barbed wire for days. Yesterday afternoon, they intensified their efforts, seemingly preparing for Chinese National Day. They also conducted the first, second, and third household surveys in the barbed wire area. The residents were annoyed and asked to move out. However, the Japanese troops did not approve the residents' request to leave. Therefore, those who had moved in but could not move out were only left to sigh helplessly. It is also reported that the defense situation in the Hongkou area has been very tense recently.

### Three British Gunboats Depart Shanghai Today

Scorpion Flagship Remains in Shanghai to Command

After the British government decided to withdraw five British gunboats from the Yangtze River in China, in addition to the Dragonfly and Grasshopper, which left Shanghai for Singapore on the 3rd of this month, the Ladybug, Aphid, and Cricket are scheduled to leave Shanghai at 8:00 AM today. Their destination is also Singapore. As for the Scorpion, as the flagship of Commander Hu Yuantai of the Yangtze River Fleet, it has been decided to temporarily dock in Shanghai to command the other ships.

### British and American Passenger Ships Arrive in Shanghai on Schedule

British Company's Putton Arrives in Shanghai from London via Hong Kong

The American President Lines' President Cleveland, which is scheduled to arrive in the Far East from Los Angeles, was slightly delayed due to the scheduled departure time, so it cannot arrive in Shanghai today. It is now scheduled to arrive on the 15th and depart for Hong Kong and Manila on the 16th. The C&I Line's liner Sassica (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai on the 7th and docked at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong. The ship carried more than ten passengers from England to China, who originally took the British Company's Rampura to Shanghai. After the ship arrived at Kolkata, it returned to England and then transferred to the Sassica to Shanghai. The passengers and cargo to and from Shanghai have also been loaded and unloaded. It is scheduled to raise anchor today and head to Japan and then to Hong Kong and return to Kolkata. Also, the British Company's Eurasia Line's regular postal ship Putton has departed from England for China. It is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong today and arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong tomorrow. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th. The Nellore managed by the company, which travels to San Francisco, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.

### Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Resumes Traffic; Express and Freight Trains Can Also Run Soon; Domestic Section Uses Customs Gold, Consistent with Vietnamese Currency Price

The foundation of the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was washed away by floods on the 26th of last month, and traffic was suddenly interrupted. After active repairs by the railway bureau, slow trains have been reluctantly restored. However, passengers must get off the train and walk from Xujia Ferry to Chengjiang, and then change trains. The journey takes one day longer than usual (usually takes three days). Express and freight trains are still suspended, but will be restored soon. Also, regarding the ticket prices of the railway, because the currency system of the domestic section and the Vietnamese section of the railway is different (the domestic section uses Customs Gold as the unit, and the Vietnamese section uses Vietnamese currency as the unit), and each unit fluctuates from time to time, the ticket price also increases and decreases. According to the latest regulations of the railway bureau, each Customs Gold is equivalent to 2.8 Vietnamese currency (usually only equivalent to 2.4 Vietnamese currency), so the ticket price also increases accordingly. Recently, the exchange rate has skyrocketed, with each Vietnamese currency equivalent to more than 3.5 national currency. The cost of the ticket is even more unaffordable, which adds another burden to the general travelers going to the mainland via Vietnam.

### Rice Prices Fell Again Yesterday; Marketed Volume Reached 10,000 Shi; Market Situation Remains Pessimistic; But Transportation Rights Still Controlled by Japanese

This year's rainfall is well-distributed. Rice producing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, such as Wuxi, Changshu, Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Pinghu, have all reported bumper harvests, increasing by 20-30% compared to last year. After the early rice harvest in various places, due to the high prices in the Shanghai market, a large amount of rice has arrived in Shanghai from the mainland. Yesterday, 11 inland river ships arrived, totaling 2,730 shi, and 30 land transport vehicles, totaling 3,750 shi. The quantity has increased by 30-40% compared to last week. In addition to the 2,730 shi that arrived yesterday, there were also 5,384 bags, totaling 10,000 shi, which is the highest since autumn. Due to oversupply, prices continued to fall. Jiangbei Xian fell by 7 jiao, Luo Xian fell by 1 yuan, Yang Xian fell by 5 jiao, and Japonica rice fell by 1 yuan. Each grade has fallen by 10 yuan compared to the peak. However, the market situation remains pessimistic, so the number of transactions is only half of the goods that arrived. As for the group order for foreign rice, although the registration has reached more than 60,000 bags, Jiangbei Xian is only 18.5 yuan and the best Japonica rice is only 32 yuan. Based on the current foreign exchange rate, it is more expensive than Japonica rice. Ordering foreign rice is no longer necessary, so the decision has been temporarily postponed.

Japanese Still Manipulating Rice Prices

The Shanghai Municipal Council conducts weekly surveys of rice stocks in various warehouses throughout the city. Due to the recent increase in arrivals and sluggish sales, foreign warehouse stocks have also increased. The grain stocks in various warehouses last week increased by 10,000 bags (shi) compared to the previous week. Taixing, Taizhou, Rugao, Jiangyan, and other places in Jiangbei previously had low rice prices, so rice merchants went to purchase them. However, after the continuous drop in prices, it is difficult to make a profit after shipping them to Shanghai, so rice merchants have gone to purchase Japonica rice nearby. Therefore, rice prices in the city should be able to fall close to the limit price in the near future, and there is no need to worry about the future of food. However, the 13 rice ships from the mainland that arrived in Shanghai the other day were detained by the Japanese on the west section of the Suzhou Creek. After various efforts, they were finally released. Therefore, the source of rice is determined by the Japanese at any time. What should be detained and what should be released has no fixed standard. The rice industry can only sigh helplessly.

Coal Workers Demand Exceeds Scope

The city's coal workers have requested that the bean and rice industry association deduct 1 fen of coal labor for rice shipped to Shanghai by the Changjiang Gang, and the matter has not been resolved. It is said that the bean and rice industry is divided into two gangs, North and South. The production areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, etc., are the Southern Gang, and the production areas of Kunshan, Changshu, Suzhou, Wuxi, etc., are the Northern Gang. The rice from these two production areas is loaded on civilian ships to Shanghai, hence the name "River Cargo." Before the War of Resistance, the coal workers' coal labor cost 24 wen per shi (equivalent to 8 li). Since the start of the War of Resistance, it has been difficult to transport River Cargo, so it has been changed to railway transportation. Therefore, it has been changed from loose containers to packaging, with each package weighing more than 1 shi and 2 dou. Since the number of jin and liang have been specified, there is no need for coal workers. However, those who work as coal workers in Shanghai are hired by merchants, but they only have food to eat and no wages. Now, due to the packaging, they are completely unemployed and cannot maintain their lives. In order to take care of the lives of these people, the association, in this extraordinary period, regardless of packaging or ship transport, as long as it is rice produced in the Northern and Southern Gangs, even if it is loaded onto ships via the Changjiang River and shipped to Shanghai, 1 fen of coal labor will be deducted for every 160 jin to provide relief, which is a considerable amount. Now, the coal workers do not understand the internal organization of the association and request that the rice shipped to Shanghai by the Changjiang Gang also be deducted 1 fen per shi, which the association does not have the power to do. This is not within the scope of the association. The so-called Changjiang Gang production areas are Wuhu, Nanjing, and other places in Jiangbei, which are loaded on Yangtze River steamships, weighed but not by shi, so there is no need for coal workers or coal labor. "This is purchased by merchants from Anhui, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Nanjing, and other gangs, which belongs to the miscellaneous grain industry association. The coal workers' request exceeds this scope, so we can only explain in detail and publicly announce it to the society."

### Indian Youths Give an Account of Their Travels

Departing Shanghai for Hong Kong on a Scheduled Date, They Wish to Meet the People of Shanghai: Three Indian youths, traveling the globe by bicycle, passed through Shanghai. Details have already been reported in this newspaper. Now, these Indian youths have issued a statement saying: Since we completed our studies in our homeland, we spent several years working hard at our respective careers. Except for one who worked as an insurance broker, the rest of us were electrical engineers. During our time of employment, we harbored a burning desire and jointly planned in advance to

Save some money

for the grand endeavor of traveling the world. After several years, we were fortunate enough to not be disappointed. We calculated the amount of our savings, which was sufficient to cover our expenses for two years of travel. As for the source of funds after those two years, we had to make up our minds to give speeches, submit articles, broadcast on the radio, or sell our writings in the places we passed through, to sustain our lives on the journey. However, contrary to our expectations, we had only passed through

Fourteen Months

of our journey and had not been in England for long when our two-year budget was exhausted. From then on, we had no choice but to continue our previous approach of struggling to survive. When we set off from Bombay on our bicycles in April 1933, the situation in our homeland was extremely dire. Although it was shrouded in recession, we were always determined to advance towards our aspirations, relying on our spirit. We were not worried about not finding food to eat abroad, nor were we afraid that people from all walks of life would not give us

Good Sympathy

The purpose of our journey is not just to take risks in such a simple way. At the same time, we want to promote our homeland's culture everywhere, so that the world can learn more about it. We always feel that travel easily increases international and personal goodwill. Therefore, every time we give a speech or broadcast somewhere, we resolutely

Explain in Detail

the doubts and misunderstandings that the audience has about India. At the same time, we will record in detail the different customs and cultures of the places we pass through, and prepare to report all our feelings to our compatriots in detail when we return to rebuild our country in the future. Since we left our homeland, we have traveled 40,000 miles and passed through countries such as Afghanistan, Persia, Turkey, the Balkan countries, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Belgium, England, Ireland, France, Spain, Switzerland, and from Egypt to

Southern Africa

and from there across the Atlantic Ocean to Brazil, Panama, Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, the United States, and Canada, and then across the Pacific Ocean to Japan. After arriving in Shanghai, we plan to go south to Hong Kong before heading to the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Java, Sumatra, Singapore, the Malay colonies, Siam, and Burma. We hope to be able to

Return to Our Homeland

in 1943. What we feel most disappointed about is that China is currently in a time of turmoil, and we do not have the opportunity to visit the interior. However, we are still hoping that the flames of war in China will soon be extinguished, and we hope to come back for a pilgrimage. As we said earlier, our journey is not just about taking risks in such a simple way. However, in the eight years of scaling mountains and sailing the seas, we have naturally encountered many dangers. For example, we got lost in the Afghan desert and were only rescued after three days. In the northern capital of Persia, we were staying in a place that

Was Collapsed by Accumulated Snow

in the early morning. We spent a lot of effort to dig a small path to escape. For example, in Turkish territory, we were suspected by the authorities of being spies and were detained for fifteen days before being released. In West Africa, we had a near-death experience for a full twenty-one months. We must have encountered at least twenty-one times the pursuit of wild animals, the dangers of rapids and thorny forests, and the attacks of intense heat and severe cold.

Now in Shanghai

we are staying for a while, and we also hope to have the opportunity to meet people from all walks of life. If any associations or other groups would like to hear about everything we have experienced on our journey, please come to the White Head Association at 29 Rue des Patrouilles, or call 86776, and you will be able to contact us. We plan to set off for Hong Kong on the 17th of this month. By the way,

### Woman Injured in Abortion, Old Woman Arrested, Further Investigation Awaits Woman's Recovery

Yuan Xu, daughter of Xu Wang, an elderly woman from Jiangbei residing at No. 5, Lane 325, Wuding Road (30 years old), has been working as a female worker at a certain factory at No. 57, Rue de Reims. Around May of this year, she fell in love with a male worker from the same factory named Zheng Wan-shi. After several encounters, she became pregnant, already five months along.

A Conspicuous Abdomen

was unsightly. After discussion with her paramour Deng Wan-bao, on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month at 3:00 PM, they went together to the home of Tang Yu, a 70-year-old Nanchang woman at No. 14, Tangjia Lane, North Fujian Road, and agreed to have the fetus in her abdomen removed for a price of thirty yuan. Tang Yu is an experienced abortionist, equipped with rubber gloves and iodine and other items.

A Surgical Procedure

was used to open Yuan Xu's vagina, and the five-month-old fetus was removed after a while and discarded somewhere. Yuan Xu was allowed to rest in her home. On the afternoon of the 8th at 2:00 PM, Yuan Xu returned to the home of her mother, Xu Wang, on Wuding Road, and felt pain in her abdomen and could not urinate or defecate. She told her mother about the situation. Xu Wang immediately hired a car to take her daughter to Guangren Hospital for treatment. After

Medical Treatment

it was found that Yuan Xu had suffered severe injuries from the abortion and required surgery to save her life, otherwise she would be in great danger. The hospital then telephoned the Gordon Road Police Station, who dispatched detective Cui Jinchuan to No. 14, Tangjia Lane, North Fujian Road, and arrested the abortionist Tang Yu, along with a bottle of iodine and rubber gloves.

Taken to the Police Station

Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan reported the case and stated that the defendant had committed a similar crime in 1932 and was sentenced to six months in prison with a three-year reprieve. He requested a postponement of the case until the victim Yuan Xu recovered, etc. When questioned, the old woman Tang Yu gave evasive answers and begged for leniency. Judge Huang Risheng ordered her to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

### Incident of Mistakenly Detaining a British Citizen, Apologies Three Times

The English Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that Colonel Igarashi, advisor to the "Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau," and Lu Ying, director of the puppet bureau, visited Major General Simons of the British Army in Shanghai last Saturday and Sunday to express their regret for the police department's mistaken arrest of Reuters correspondent Walter, a British citizen. This was the third apology made by the puppet municipal police since Walter was arrested at his residence on Yuyuan Road. First, when Walter was released on Friday morning, the puppet bureau apologized to him. In the afternoon of the same day, Colonel Igarashi and Lu Ying formally apologized to British Consul Kitson. On the following day, the Japanese again apologized to Major General Simons.

### Japanese Cotton Exports Greatly Reduced

The Continental Daily News reported that, according to the Japanese newspaper Continental New Report, after the outbreak of the European war, merchants in the Dutch East Indies and British India adopted a wait-and-see policy, resulting in a sharp decline in Japanese cotton exports in September.

### Rampant Thugs in the "Badlands," Gambling Dens Have Poor Business, Puppet "Bureau of Opium Suppression" Levies Heavy Taxes, Business of Opium Dens Also Greatly Affected

The English Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that, according to what a reporter learned from an inspection in western Shanghai on Saturday and Sunday nights, the evil atmosphere in the area has gradually declined and returned to dormancy due to the collapse of law and order. The "Badlands" have become "Deadlands." The thugs in the area include members of the so-called "Self-Defense Corps" affiliated with the "Great Way Police Bureau" and plainclothes soldiers of the "Pacification Army."

Rampant and Unscrupulous

They made the once prosperous "Badlands" gambling dens and their surroundings feel uneasy and terrorized, resulting in a sharp decline in the gambling business. Gamblers were indifferent to rumors of the "Great Way" side clearing the "Badlands" and the Public Concession Police Department tightening the curfew, but when they found armed thugs wandering around and carrying out robberies, they were afraid to go to the gambling dens. It is said that these thugs also go to the gambling dens to gamble. If they win, they leave safely. If they lose, they

Wait Outside

to rob gamblers who win money. The bodyguards hired by the gambling dens are powerless because they know that if they interfere, the thugs will greet them with bullets. As a result of the thugs' activities, the prosperous days of the "Badlands" are now over. The famous Hollywood Amusement Park is the largest gambling den in the area. On Saturday and Sunday nights, only one roulette table had thirty or forty gamblers around it. In another room, there were two Fan-Tan tables and

A Few Gamblers From Other Provinces

and several foreigners in each room. Apart from the depressed employees of the gambling dens, there were no gamblers at all. There were also very few opium smokers. The Shen Garden, which used to be a dog racing track and was later converted into a Chinese sports center, has recently become a gambling den. Although roulette equipment has been prepared, no one goes to gamble there. Apart from a "dice gambling table" with twenty gamblers around it, all other places were silent, like the Jiujiang Road during the New Year. The taverns, where

Nude Performances

used to attract hundreds of customers, had very poor business that night. Other nightlife spots in the "Badlands" also had very few customers. The non-gambling venues along Yuyuan Road suffered even more due to the lack of law and order in the area and the fact that American sailors and Marines were not allowed to go there, resulting in particularly poor business. Although the situation in the "Badlands" is like this, it is said that nightlife spots in the Public Concession and the French Concession are thriving. The gambling dens in the "Badlands" are

Quite Shocked

by this development and are seriously considering ways to attract gamblers, one of which is to provide a variety of entertainment performances, such as performances that cannot be staged in the two concessions. The opium business in the "Badlands" is also affected by the lack of law and order. In addition to being harassed by armed thugs, opium dens are also suffering from heavy taxes levied by the "Reformed Government's Opium Suppression Bureau." The bureau's office is located at 52 Kangfu Lane, Route Bricol, and it charges every ounce of opium brought into the "Badlands"

A Fee of One Dime

The bureau also stipulates the opium sales quota for each opium den. If the opium sales are less than the previous month, the opium den owner will be held responsible for the decline in the bureau's income and will be heavily fined.

### Son Lost for More Than a Year, Father and Son Reunited, Child Sent to Court After Disappearance, Adopted by a Bailiff Who is Now Recognized as Foster Father

Yan Dajue, a Cantonese lawyer residing at No. 131, Museum Road, had a son named Zhong Biao, who was only seven years old. He suddenly disappeared in August of last year. The French police took him in, but because no one claimed him for a long time, they sent the child to court. At that time, Chen Xinghe, bailiff No. 559 of the court, requested

To Adopt Him

and take him as his adopted son. The court approved it. Yan had been searching for his beloved son since he disappeared, and he had reported it to the Public Concession police, who searched everywhere without success. It wasn't until the 8th of this month that Chen took Zhong Biao to the Daxin Company amusement park, where they were suddenly spotted. He then went forward to negotiate, and Chen explained the circumstances of the adoption. Yesterday, both parties went to the Second Special District Court to request

A Solution

Judge Qiu summoned them for questioning. According to Yan's statement, since his son disappeared, Chen Xinghe had taken him in, and now he was claiming the child to reunite the family. Chen did not object, and he was extremely grateful and intended to recognize Chen as his foster father to repay the kindness of adoption. The court examined the statements and ruled that Yan Zhong Biao be allowed to be taken home by his father Yan Dajue.

### Chen Liangyu Passes Away

Memorial Service to be Held Today at Qingliang Temple

Mr. Chen Liangyu of Zhenhai was honest and kind by nature and proficient in political science and law. He successively served as a judge of the Shanghai South General Engineering Bureau, a director of the County Chamber of Commerce, an arbitrator of the General Chamber of Commerce, a member of the National Goods Promotion Committee, and a member of the Labor-Capital Arbitration Committee. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to public welfare affairs, such as the Ningbo Fellow Association, the Siming Guild Hall, the Famine Relief Association of various provinces, the Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association, the Renji Shantang, and the Pushan Villa, tirelessly serving in all of them. The Pushan Villa had no funds for burial expenses, but thanks to Mr. Chen's efforts, it has achieved what it is today. After the August 13th Incident, he was enthusiastic about burial work and refugee relief. However, he fell ill due to overwork and suddenly passed away on August 23rd, at the age of seventy-three. He is survived by three sons, fifteen grandchildren (male and female), and five great-grandchildren (male and female). In his dying words, he instructed his sons to allocate the condolence money to the Pushan Villa and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. His benevolence and righteousness are truly admirable. A memorial service will be held today at Qingliang Temple on Niuzhuang Road, and one imagines that the plain carriage and white horse will surely bring a scene of mourning and honor.

### Wu Meiqing, Respected Elder of Wuxing in Shanghai, Mourned

Mr. Wu Meiqing, a respected elder of Wuxing, was usually enthusiastic about public welfare and benefited his hometown. Fellow villagers of Lake County deeply loved and respected him.

More than 200 guests, including Yuan Ludeng and Shen Tianxin, attended. The Lake Society Committee held a public memorial service, presided over by Mr. Yan Junyi. For a time, there was extreme mourning and honor.

### Dancer Concludes She is Pregnant, Accuses a Customer of Abandonment, Cannot Determine Who Impregnated Her, Girl Sent to Forensic Doctor for Examination Before Further Hearing

Cao Zheng, a young clerk (also known as Cao Zhen, 19 years old, from Nanxiang) at Cao Xiangtai Silk and Cotton Store, No. 276 Rue du Consulat, privately arranged a marriage agreement with Qian Xiuying (also known as Huizhen, 17 years old), a dancer at the Da Mei Dance Hall, No. 66 Kuei An Li, Rue Gloc. A physical relationship ensued.

Girl Became Pregnant

Due to her inability to dance, she stopped working and stayed at home, waiting for Cao to send a matchmaker to discuss the marriage. However, Cao Xing Yin avoided her. The girl's parents negotiated the marriage with the man's family. Cao's parents opposed the marriage because the girl was a dancer, which would affect their reputation. Therefore, the girl's father, Qian Shaoqing, as her legal representative, hired a lawyer to sue Cao Zheng in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for seduction and abandonment, disrupting family ethics and morals. After an initial court hearing, Cao Zheng

admitted in court that he could not fulfill his wishes due to his parents' opposition. The court ordered a postponement and ordered the defendant to post bail pending further questioning of the girl's father. This case was re-examined yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM by Judge Zhang Minsheng. Both parties and their lawyers were present in court. First, the plaintiff Qian Xiuying's father, Qian Shaoqing, acting as legal representative, testified. He was 58 years old, from Changshu, and worked as a tailor. He used to live in Hongkou but moved to Kuei An Li during the January 28th Incident. His daughter, Xiuying, started dancing in May of last year, first learning at the Xiaoyao Dance Hall. At this point, the court said to the plaintiff's lawyer, Zhou Yingjie, "Your petition states that Qian Shaoqing is Qian Xiuying's mother, 41 years old this year. Why is the testimony today

Inconsistent?

The lawyer replied, "The plaintiff and her mother always came together to commission the firm, and they did not specify her father. The petition was drafted based on what they said." The court immediately ordered the petition to be corrected in court. Then, Qian Xiuying was questioned about the circumstances of her relationship with Cao Zheng. Qian's testimony was the same as before. Cao admitted that he had a relationship with Qian and had lived in the plaintiff's house. He claimed that the girl had many dance partners, and he could not determine if he was the one who caused the pregnancy. At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Wang Hengyuan, offered

A Letter

stating that Hong Da Kui, who lived at No. 34 Yüqing Li, Chengdu, sent a letter to the defendant's father, Cao Yongxiang, stating that the plaintiff Qian Xiuying was his lover and they had a marriage agreement. He accused the defendant of stealing his love and threatened to retaliate if they married. He presented the letter for review. After reviewing it, the court ordered a postponement to the 18th for further questioning. The defendant remained on bail, and the plaintiff Qian Xiuying was ordered to be sent to a forensic doctor for examination pending verification.

### Small Boat of Puppet "Fish Market" Carelessly Loses Control at Wusong Estuary, Dozens of Passengers Burned, Cargo Ship Completely Destroyed

Yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM, a small steamship, Yong An, hired by the puppet "Fish Market", loaded with fish and passengers from Chongming to Shanghai, unexpectedly, when it sailed to the outside of Wusong Estuary, for some reason, three large boxes of gasoline installed inside the ship suddenly exploded, and the entire cabin was filled with fire in a flash. Passengers saw the situation and scrambled in chaos, with cries and screams echoing. Because rescue was impossible at that time, the fire could only be allowed to spread, resulting in all forty or fifty male and female passengers being burned, with no one spared. Another barge happened to see it and provided assistance, and then transported dozens of injured people to Shanghai and sent them directly to the Shanghai East Hospital for treatment. It is reported that among them, two fishmongers, Chen Lingeng and Zhang Ade, both from Chongming, were the most seriously injured, their skin and flesh completely stripped off, and their lives were in danger. The ship was completely burned and turned into an iron shell.

### The New China Grows in Struggle

— De Yin

China Has Now Awakened

Today's China is suffering unprecedented hardship. However, with few exceptions, every Chinese person is increasingly confident in their nation. Everyone feels that any significant, necessary price is worth paying to strive for national independence and freedom. Moreover, facts prove that the awakened New China, despite the extreme devastation of the invaders, is ultimately thriving and growing.

Driven by the Xinhai Revolution

This phenomenon of national awakening began with the Xinhai Revolution. The success of the Xinhai Revolution indicated that China, which occupies an important position in the world, is by no means an unpromising, nearly declining country. It can no longer tolerate the bullying of imperialism and seeks development independently and freely. Although the imperialist powers were jealous of the expansion of China's revolutionary forces, they were forced by circumstances to recognize the republican government at that time. The twenty-eight years of history since the establishment of the Republic of China, on the one hand, reflect the power struggles of the powers in China, and on the other hand, represent the continuation of the Chinese national revolutionary forces' struggle against imperialism.

Among the imperialist powers, it goes without saying that Japanese imperialism is the most oppressive to China. The most heartbreaking national humiliations in modern Chinese history were all bestowed by Japanese imperialism. Historical fate dictates that Japanese imperialism, due to its backwardness during the period of its rise and due to the limitations of its geographical situation, must adopt the goal of conquering China. For this reason, China's revolution cannot be separated from the struggle against Japan, and the main task of the Chinese revolution is to destroy Japanese imperialism. The beginning of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary movement, namely the establishment of the Zhonghe Society, coincided with the year before the Sino-Japanese War, which cannot be said to be entirely accidental.

Great Potential Power

Japanese imperialism's idea of invading China was decided as early as the time of the annexation of Japan and Korea. The famous Tanaka Memorial clearly stipulates that Japan should adopt a continental policy, starting with Manchuria and Mongolia, and then use military threats to subdue the people of all China through "domination." In other words, it is to destroy China. However, the 450 million Chinese people have great potential power. Thanks to the constant efforts and appeals of revolutionary pioneers, the Chinese people are awakening and uniting day by day. Seven years ago, Japan seized the four northeastern provinces by force, but contrary to the expectations of the Japanese militarists, the Chinese people not only did not become "dominated" because of this, but instead became more and more determined in their will to resist. The cannon fire at Lugou Bridge finally became the clarion call for the nationwide war of resistance. Japanese imperialism had to fall into the quagmire of war.

Superior Weapons Have Lost Their Effectiveness

During the two-year war, Japanese imperialism, relying on its superior weapons, did occupy many cities along the transportation arteries of China. However, it could not do anything to control areas slightly away from the transportation arteries, no matter how hard it tried. At the same time, Japan's domestic economy is becoming increasingly exhausted due to the protracted war. After the recent defeat in northern Hunan, Japanese soldiers have certainly become more and more lacking in confidence in their ability to continue their offensive.

China Has Taken the Initiative

As for China, in the military aspect, the Chinese army has gradually gained the advantage of taking the initiative in the counteroffensive; in the political aspect, the whole country is working together to support the war of resistance; in the economic aspect, the Chinese government's international credit is becoming increasingly consolidated, and the construction of the rear is also making progress day by day. All of this is sufficient to prove that China's resistance is becoming stronger day by day with the progress of the war of resistance.

The goal of independence and freedom is gradually approaching for China, no matter what. However, as the ancients said, "He who walks a hundred li is halfway at ninety." The struggle in the coming days will still be extremely difficult. Every Chinese person must stand on their own position and work twice as hard.

### Recollections of the Xinhai Revolution

— Wang Boxiang

1. The Prelude to the Revolution: In the late years of the Qing Dynasty, foreign aggression was imminent, and the administration was corrupt. Patriotic people all wanted to strengthen themselves. They were divided into two major factions due to different views: one faction advocated "constitutionalism to save the country," and the other faction advocated "national revolution." The Qing court, forced by the situation, had to agree to constitutionalism and oppose revolution, but the result was that "false constitutionalism" led to a "true revolution."

The revolutionary party's uprising began with the Guangzhou Uprising in the twenty-second year of Guangxu (1896). The person in charge of this was President Sun. Afterwards, the revolutionary party repeatedly failed in the Huizhou, Zhennanguan, Hekou, and Guangzhou Second Revolution, but their courage did not wane. Finally, they took advantage of the trend of the state recovering the Sichuan-Han Railway and launched the first uprising in Wuchang.

2. The Wuchang Uprising and the Response of the Provinces

On the nineteenth day of the eighth lunar month in the Xinhai year (i.e., October 10, 1911), the revolutionaries of the left team of the eighth battalion of the Wuchang Engineering Camp took the lead in launching an uprising. The next morning, they divided their troops and went to Hanyang and Hankou, and elected Li Yuanhong, the commanding officer of the 21st Mixed Brigade of the Army, as the "Military Governor of the Military Government of the Republic of China." With this call, all parties responded quickly. In just a few months, the provinces successively announced their recovery.

3. The Fall of Hanyang and the Capture of Nanjing

After the Wuchang Uprising, the Qing court immediately sent naval and land forces to attack. On the 27th, the two sides began fighting, and the Qing army was defeated and retreated north along the railway line. When the news was received that Yuan Shikai was about to go south to supervise the army, the situation changed, because the southern survivors of the Qing army were all old subordinates of Yuan. When they heard that their old commander was returning, their courage naturally rose sharply. On the sixth day of the ninth lunar month, they fought with the civilian army again, and with the help of warships, they attacked into Dazhimen in Hankou, started looting, and then set it on fire. At that time, the civilian army retreated to Hanyang. On the 26th day of the ninth lunar month, they began to cross the Han River and shelled the Qing army, advancing and retreating. On the 28th, all the naval vessels revolted and fired to assist in the battle, and the Qing army's momentum was greatly thwarted. It just so happened that Yuan Shikai formed a new cabinet in Beijing and strictly ordered the Qing army to advance on Hanyang, turning from defense to offense. On the third, fourth, and fifth days of the ninth lunar month, there were bloody battles for several consecutive days. On the afternoon of the seventh day, Hanyang was regained by the Qing army, and they were able to use the giant cannons of Turtle Mountain to bombard Wuchang across the river at any time. The entire city of Wuchang fell into the fire line, and the situation was critical. Fortunately, the civilian army defended the city firmly. In just four or five days, Nanjing, the fundamental stronghold in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, was captured by the civilian army. As a result, the foundation of the civilian army became more consolidated. After the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu successively recovered, the civilian army in China had reached the point where it "occupied two-thirds of the world."

4. The Establishment of the Provisional Government

The Hubei Governor's Office realized that the recovered provinces were each governing themselves, and there was no joint organization to carry out the work, which was very inconvenient. Therefore, it summoned representatives from various provinces to Wuhan for a meeting, using the Shunchang Foreign Firm in the British Concession in Hankou as the meeting place. The first meeting was held on the tenth day of the tenth lunar month, and on the thirteenth day, the outline of the organization of the provisional government was resolved and announced on the same day. On the fourteenth day, the news of the capture of Nanjing was heard, and it was decided that Nanjing would be the location of the provisional government. From the 21st to the 23rd, representatives from various provinces gathered in Nanjing, and on the tenth day of the eleventh lunar month, a meeting was held to elect the Provisional President. Representatives from seventeen provinces attended the meeting, totaling seventeen votes. President Sun received sixteen votes alone and was elected as the Provisional President of the Republic of China. President Sun took office in Nanjing on the thirteenth day of the eleventh lunar month. That day happened to be January 1 of the solar calendar. Since the provisional government decided to adopt the solar calendar, the day President Sun took office was designated as New Year's Day of the first year of the Republic of China.

Historical Fragments

### Important Party and State Figures in the Era of the Xinhai Revolution

Although the Xinhai Revolution is now twenty-eight years old, most of the military and political leaders currently in the War of Resistance are still the figures who devoted themselves to the national revolution at that time. As the Double Ten National Day anniversary approaches, we will flip through the history of the past and extract the glorious history of the military and political leaders who are currently holding important positions in the party and state at that time twenty-eight years ago, which I think will also be welcomed by readers.

Chairman Lin: After the Xinhai Revolution, when the provisional government was established, Mr. Lin was elected as the speaker of the Senate.

Chairman Chiang: When the Wuchang Uprising broke out, Mr. Chiang happened to be in Japan, serving as a candidate officer, attached to the 17th Cavalry Regiment in Takada. At that time, he was already a member of the Tongmenghui. After hearing the news of the revolution, he returned to Shanghai with his comrades and plunged into the revolutionary upsurge, founding the Xiejihui, and was responsible for planning military expenses. He also served as the commander of the 5th Regiment of the Shanghai Army, leading troops to fight in various parts of Zhejiang.

Feng Yuxiang: During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Feng was serving as the Battalion Commander of the Third Battalion of the Eightieth Regiment of the Qing Army, under the jurisdiction of Chen Huan, the commander of the 20th Town, stationed in Tanghe on the Beijing-Fengtian Railway. After the Wuchang Uprising, he secretly plotted to respond to the independent civilian army, but failed to achieve his goal.

Yu Youren: During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Yu was still a journalist, running the Minli Daily and the Shenzhou Daily, propagating the revolution very vigorously. In January of the first year of the Republic of China, when the Nanjing Provisional Government was established, he was appointed as the Deputy Minister of Transportation.

Li Liejun: During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Li conspired with Cai E and Tang Jiyao to make Yunnan independent. Later, he returned to his home province of Jiangxi and served as the head of the Jiangxi branch of the Tongmenghui, running around for the Jiangxi independence movement, leading the Northern Expedition Army of Jiangxi, and serving as the commander of the Hubei Relief Army.

Wang Chonghui: During the Xinhai Revolution, he represented Guangdong and attended the Nanjing Conference, serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Nanjing Provisional Government.

Wang Zhengting: After the Xinhai Revolution, he traveled around for the North-South peace talks and served as the Director of Foreign Affairs of the Hubei Military Government.

Yan Xishan: During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Yan was the commander of the 43rd Association of the Shanxi New Army, stationed in Shanxi. He and his comrades launched an uprising in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, in response to the revolution. He also killed Lu Zhongqi, the governor of Shanxi at that time, and was elected as the Governor of Shanxi, announcing the independence of Shanxi. At the same time, he sent troops to Niangziguan to prevent the Qing army from invading Shanxi.

Ma Junwu: During the Xinhai Revolution, he was a representative of Guangxi and went to Nanjing, devoting himself to the organization of the provisional government.

Cai Yuanpei: During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Cai returned to Shanghai from Japan and participated in the hub of the civilian army. After the establishment of the Nanjing Provisional Government, he was elected as an advisor.

Sun Ke: During the Xinhai Revolution, President Sun was in Europe, while Mr. Sun Zhesheng was in San Francisco, USA. In the United States, he once made a declaration stating that after China established a republic, the right to vote should be determined according to the level of education, and women should also be given the right to vote.

Shen Junru: Mr. Shen, known as one of the Seven Gentlemen, served as the Commissioner of Foreign Affairs of the Zhejiang Military Government during the Xinhai Revolution.

### Female Revolutionary Soldiers During the Xinhai Revolution

— Huan

In the history of the Xinhai Revolution, there is no shortage of female heroes, and Ms. Qiu Jin is the most famous. Secondly, Ms. Xue Suzhen in Shanghai once led students from Shangxia Women's School to organize the Women's National Army and submitted it to Governor Chen Qimei for approval. Her submission stated: "Since ancient times, women have formed armies and palace women have taught formations; Mulan replaced her father and Liangyu assisted her husband. History has passed on beautiful stories, and future generations should not allow them to be surpassed. Recently, with the sound of Chu songs, righteous flags have been raised in all directions. Shanghai is a major commercial port, and the governor is born in response to the times; merchants and people have formed dare-to-die corps, and the academic community has started pioneer teams. The rise and fall of a country is the responsibility of every woman. Now, the Women's National Army is initiated, and everything will be done in accordance with the methods of the male national army and people. Detailed rules will be submitted for approval. At the impact of the 20th century trend, the stage is divided by men and women; to revitalize the 5,000-year-old weakness of literature, the national soul is recruited together with the weavers." A few days later, she led female student representatives to the Governor's Office to request an audience. Governor Chen was busy with military affairs and appointed a receptionist to inquire about everything. That evening at 9:00 p.m., he approved the organization. The approval stated: "Reading the brief regulations, I can see that women's patriotism is no less than that of men. If all women in the world are like you, why worry about not soaring in the world? Now that you have abandoned rouge and powder and engaged in black iron, the courage of the enemy will be lost in the face of the women's army..." Now that the country is in turmoil and the soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles, all my patriotic female compatriots, upon reading this, should not allow Qiu Xue to monopolize the beauty of the past. Mr. Sun Yat-sen in his youth.

### National Day Talks About the Hongmen Society

— Sang Yu

Continue to Tread on the Bloodstains of the Martyrs and Create a Glorious History of the Future

From the founding history of the Republic of China, we can find many examples of the pioneers who created the Republic of China fighting together with the old secret societies. The most important things are the relationship between the Xingzhonghui and the Gelaohui. These two societies once merged, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen served as the chairman. (Twelve years before the founding of the Republic of China) The United States Zhigongtang held a general meeting in San Francisco eight years before the founding of the Republic of China to welcome President Sun and respectfully called him "Brother Sun." The Huanghuagang Uprising was the most powerful revolutionary movement to create the Republic of China. Half of the funds for this movement came from the Zhigongtang members in Canada. At that time, because the expenses were temporarily increased, the members could not raise enough money and even sold public and private property to donate to the revolution. These three events are the most famous events in which Hongmen Society members participated in the revolution. In addition, Huang Xing, Qiu Jin, Chen Shaobai, etc. are founding fathers in the history of the Chinese revolution, and they are also very famous "leaders" and "fans" of the Three Dots Society. In fact, if we flip through the founding history of the Republic of China for more than 30 years before and after, almost every one of the 200 or so uprisings, large and small, had secret society members participating, and they were very powerful fighters in each one. At that time, although there were many names for secret societies, such as the Three Dots Society and the Gelaohui, the general name was the Hongmen Society Party.

Are all the members of the Hongmen Society Party revolutionaries? Did all the Hongmen Society members who participated in the revolution do so to create the Republic of China? That may not be the case. Here are two excerpts from history:

"...Li Yunbiao and others thought that the Xingzhonghui, etc. did not provide enough, and did not satisfy their desires. It happened that Kang Youwei came to Hong Kong from Nanyang, wanting to use him, and gave Li and others 100 taels of gold each. Li and others thought that Kang was rich, so they developed a relationship with him. Bi Yongnian (Mr. Bi was a friend of Sun Yat-sen, Tang Caichang, and others) blamed them for righteousness, but it was ineffective, so he resentfully thought of being tired of the world and threw himself into Putuo and shaved his hair to become a monk. Li and others later helped Tang Caichang run the Hankou Uprising, but soon they also announced their split because they could not get funding..." (Page 159 of the History of the Founding of the Republic of China)

From this historical fact, we can find that there were also traitors in the Hongmen Society who were greedy for money, sold friends, and even forgot righteousness. At least this Mr. Li was like this. However, the Xinhai Revolution was ultimately launched due to the sympathy and assistance of the heroic Hongmen Society members, and it was also due to this that the Republic of China was created for the hundreds of millions of Chinese people. The ugly acts of a few traitors are just like a little dark cloud floating over the bright moonlight. Although there are a few seconds of darkness for the people on Earth, it will never have a major effect.

Now, the Republic of China is encountering a great era again. All the people of the country should devote themselves to this great era and fight for the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation. We sincerely pray that all the secret society members in the country will advance bravely along the glorious historical traces of the martyrs such as Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing, Chen Shaobai, Bi Yongnian, and Qiu Jin, and never repeat the mistakes of Li Yunbiao.

### Thoughts on the Anniversary of the Chinese Revolution: The History of the French Revolution

— Fang Qi

Suffering is Enough to Revitalize the Country: We Can Learn from It

Many of the National Day celebrations in the past twenty-eight years have been spent in suffering. But any country is bound to have suffering. This makes us think about how many other countries have spent National Day in suffering.

This year is the 150th anniversary of the French Revolution. Let's try to examine this anniversary, which has a very long history. I don't have enough reference materials on hand—and I'm afraid there may not even be such ready-made materials—so I can't say for sure what the situation was on a certain anniversary. I can only briefly mention the general situation at that time. But what is most relevant is precisely the general situation, right?

Although the anniversary of the republic is now 150 years ago, France has spent only 85 years under republican politics. Breaking through the Bastille prison was in 1789, but the French king was not immediately overthrown. The First Republic was not established until 1792, and it lasted only 12 years, counting until Napoleon became emperor. The First Empire and the restored dynasty ruled for 44 years. In 1848, the Second Republic appeared again, but it maintained the name of a republic without actual democracy for four years. Louis Napoleon followed his uncle's old tricks and went from being the ruler to becoming the emperor, until he was captured in the Battle of Sedan in 1870. The Third Republic was established in 1871 and has lasted 69 years to this day.

The scope does not allow me to narrate year by year since 1789. Selecting only the years with major events may inevitably have selection bias, so I will try to observe each decade anniversary.

1799. This year, the country was still under the rule of the political group of the Republic, but it was on the verge of collapse due to its corruption. Napoleon was waging a war that he did not recognize as a failure in the Near East. The country was being threatened by a new alliance of three countries. Napoleon, who returned home in embarrassment, smoothly seized power the following year.

1809. The tenth year after Napoleon came to power, the sixth year after he became emperor. He had just won the Battle of Wagram against Austria and married an Austrian princess by force.

1819. The monarch of the Bourbon dynasty was carrying out a reactionary rule because the prince was assassinated.

1829. Charles X's rule was extremely reactionary. The people were extremely uneasy, and the crisis of the July Revolution the following year had matured.

1839. It was the middle of the period from the July Revolution to the February Revolution. The rebellion of the seasonal corps this year was not small in the intermittent turmoil of twenty years. 2

1849. The year after the February Revolution and the terrible June Days. Louis Napoleon was serving as president, but at this time he had controlled the Legislative Assembly and began to oppress the Republicans.

1859. Napoleon III was engaging in political maneuvering. He helped Italy fight Austria, but then withdrew his aid in the same year.

1869. The year before the Franco-Prussian War and two years before the establishment of the Third Republic.

1879. In the previous year's election of members of parliament, the Republicans had a great advantage. In this year, President MacMahon, who had been secretly plotting to restore the monarchy, was ousted, and the republic began to stabilize.

1889. The centennial of the republic was commemorated with the World's Fair and the Eiffel Tower as decorations. General Boulanger advocated retaliation against Germany, and the diplomacy of allying with Russia to contain Germany was beginning. Although Boulanger committed suicide in 1891 due to suspicion of restoring the monarchy, the Franco-Russian alliance was finally formed in 1893, which was extremely important for France's expansion of power from then on.

1899. France's ambitious plan to cross the African continent was frustrated by the Fashoda Incident, but its progress towards Morocco was recognized. The Dreyfus Affair was being redressed, and from this, the policy of clearing the power of the church in the next few years was launched.

1909. The conservative Clemenceau cabinet collapsed, and the radical forces rose to power, but the conflicts with Germany over colonial issues made the radicals' attempt to reconcile with Germany impossible. The Franco-German treaty on the Second Moroccan Crisis this year only aroused the desires of the Germans.

1919. The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28. Nationalism expanded to the point where even Clemenceau was considered too radical, and power was transferred to the more conservative Poincaré.

1929. The world economic recession began.

1939. Another long world war?

Next year's National Day, will everyone still commemorate it in war?

Table of Uprisings, Independence, and Persons in Charge in Each Province During the Xinhai Revolution

This is a photograph of representatives from various provinces gathered in Shanghai during the Xinhai Revolution, hosted by the Shanghai Commercial Association. It is also the preliminary organization of the seventeen provincial representatives, which is the parent body of the provisional government. Seated are Zhang Shen from Jiangsu, Tang Shouqian from Zhejiang, and Zhou Jinzhen from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at that time.

This is a handwritten letter from Huang Xing in the fourth year of the Republic of China. At that time, because Yuan Shikai had already taken active actions to claim the title of emperor and betray the country, Huang stayed in the United States and sent a special letter to the people who participated in the founding of the country during the Xinhai Revolution. Mr. Huang's literary excellence and calligraphy skills are excellent and are rare treasures among his posthumous works.

Reading Notes

### Anthology of Martyrs’ Poems: Loyalty and Righteousness Intertwined with National and Familial Grief, Stirring Readers to Profound Emotion

Premier Sun once said: "A revolutionary has only two paths: success or martyrdom." Before the Xinhai Revolution, many people sacrificed their lives with the spirit of "killing oneself to achieve righteousness" and "giving up life to uphold justice." Among these patriots, some came from prominent families, some had studied abroad, and some even held superior positions in secret societies. However, they still disregarded their parents, wives, positions, honor, and personal lives. They refused to yield in the face of adversity and sacrificed themselves for the country. This showed, on one hand, that they understood the great truth that revolution requires self-sacrifice; and on the other hand, they set an example for the people to awaken sympathy and resonance. Therefore, among these patriots, although few were known for their poetry, their occasional writings were always passionate and deeply moving. For example, Luo Zhonghuo, one of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, wrote a poem expressing his feelings: "Ten years of wandering on the road of life, experienced much suffering and deep worries. Daring to say that the end can be seen in the bag, how many times thrown into the stove, who heard the sound? Often shedding tears for the sake of family and country, unable to settle grievances and not satisfied. After reading 'Li Sao' three or five times, the light of the sword and the shadow of the lamp are both silent." Another poem: "Ten years, I regret not burning books earlier, the floating reputation of experience is all illusory. Not allowed to share courage with arrogant slaves, bitterly no good price to sell the head. Before the pass, war horses raise barbarian dust, within the sea, a single cloud of great disaster. Where to get a beauty with chivalrous bones, fragrant sachet and precious sword to follow me." And in the year of Wuchen, he wrote in America: "A handful of tears at Xinting, crying all over the world and hurting again. The wind and clouds of the world have become a great calamity, the nine heavens skylark soaring freely. A hundred years of arrogance, sad barbarian captives, eternal loyalty, painful Yue Wang, how many treacherous slaves willing to sell the country, pity me facing the shadow hanging the setting sun." All are extremely painful.

Huang Zhongjie, another of the seventy-two martyrs, was also skilled in poetry. One of his death poems said: "For a long time, the body and world have been entrusted to insects and sand, life and death are originally just a moment. A good head thrown to the sky, freedom flowers bloom in the blood!" Especially praised by people.

Another example is the martyr Zhong Mingguang, who was brutally murdered for bombing Long Jiguang. His self-elegy is also full of blood and tears. Now record one of his poems as follows: "A thought to repay the kindness is still against my wishes, thirty years of thoughts are all sad. Incompetent to imitate the pillar supporting the sky, no place to accommodate the cone standing on the ground. Breaking the country and destroying the family is only anger, going through fire and water is difficult to refuse. It is expected to turn into a cuckoo, wanting to repay the filial crow in the next life."

For example, Qiu Jin, a woman who disdained being a moth, has many passionate and generous works. Now record three of her poems as follows: A poem expressing indignation: "The vast divine land sighs sinking, ashamed to steal life without a plan to save the time. Willing to fight sand to revive Chu, use a wave to strike the violent Qin without a hammer. Only when the country is broken do you know the race is destroyed, righteousness is high and does not hinder the poverty of guests. Regretting to operate and repay comrades, holding a sword and singing sadly, tears flow horizontally." Also, a poem in response to the Japanese Mr. Ishii, using the original rhyme: "Don't say women are not heroes. Traveling thousands of miles alone to the east, poetic thoughts a sail, the sea and sky are moist, dreams of the three islands, the moon is exquisite. The copper camel has fallen, sadly looking back, the war horse finally neighs, not yet successful. Such a sad ancestral hatred, how can I spend the spring breeze as a guest." Also, feeling in the Yellow Sea boat: "A single sail breaks the waves, the water is vast, looking back at the mountains and rivers, a single hair green. The four walls of waves rotate the earth, a day of stars crossing the Yellow Court. A thousand years of disaster, ashes all dead, ten years of washing, the water is still fishy. The sea water and gods are distant, a single body of tears on the horizon. Hearing that the ancient battlefield, still bears traces of blood. Rushing war horses, a dream of the Central Plains, shattered mountains and rivers, ashamed of the old country,钦海无权悲素寞,磨刀有恨快恩仇, The heavenly wind blows coldly across the face, a hundred thousand clouds of smoke collected in the eyes." Qiu Jin's mind is certainly not recognizable by ordinary people, and Qiu Jin's poems also have the boldness of "vast sea and sky", the momentum of surging waves.

### After the Wuchang Uprising, Excerpts from This Newspaper's Special Edition

Yesterday (August 19th, i.e., October 10th in the solar calendar), the Wuhan revolutionary uprising destroyed all government offices below the governor-general, and the telegraph bureau and barracks were also destroyed. Governor-General Rui fled into a warship.

The entire New Army in the city of Hubei mutinied. A team of infantry, cavalry, and engineers, which had been transferred to defend the governor's office the previous day, revolted while bombarding the governor's office, fighting fiercely with the defense forces inside. The defense forces were then defeated and fled, and the office was also burned down.

It is rumored that Huang Xing led the revolutionary party in bombarding various government offices. All party members were brave and forceful, not retreating even in death.

This morning (the 21st), the revolutionary army besieged the Hanyang Arsenal and occupied it, obtaining 20,000 rifles and many field guns and mountain guns. The soldiers guarding the factory all expressed sympathy with the revolutionary party, so they did not resist much. The Hanyang Iron Factory was safe and undisturbed.

The revolutionary army has arrived in Hankou, but does not hate foreigners or disturb commerce. The Hankou customs official fled.

Xietong (brigadier general) Li Yuanhong is now the commander-in-chief of the revolutionary army. Notices have been posted everywhere inside and outside Wuhan: 1. No officials are allowed to be hidden privately; 2. No foreigners are allowed to be harmed; 3. No business is allowed to be infringed; 4. No foreign volunteer corps are allowed to be attacked; 5. No indiscriminate killing of comrades is allowed, violators will be sentenced to death. Rewards will also be given to those who search for and offer □ people, provide supplies and weapons, and protect the property and lives of foreigners.

The revolutionary army government is now fully organized. The lives and property of Europeans are safe and sound. Dozens of new people have joined the revolutionary army. Shops are open as usual. The Red Cross Society is now being organized. The revolutionary army has stopped the order of summary executions at the front. All criminals will first be studied by the Consultative Bureau and then sentenced.

Revolutionary troops often passed by Zhang Biao's camp, and Zhang's soldiers watched as if they hadn't seen them and did not attack.

The revolutionary army ordered that all military and civilians in Wuhan must cut their hair by the first day of the ninth month. Violators will be punished.

The revolutionary army county rewards those who report on the whereabouts of Rui Cheng with a reward of one thousand taels of silver, and those who find him will be rewarded ten times more.

The government is now offering a reward of ten thousand taels of silver for the head of Li Yuanhong.

The Wuchang Post Office has changed to use the "Great Han Post Office" stamp. The characters on the signboards of various silver shops and candy stores that say "Manchu" are all changed to use the characters "兴宇".

Rui Cheng and Zhang Biao are both loyal to the government, but they have both been dismissed. Li Yuanhong is the leader of the revolutionary army, but there is no explicit statement of his dismissal. People in Beijing think this is a strange thing.

Sun Yat-sen is now in Chicago, wanting to raise US$5 million to help the revolutionary army.

On the first day, the party sent two military officers with a letter to Yuan Shikai. Yuan received the letter but did not reply. A staff member Yang said that Yuan was ill and could not see guests, and rewarded the military officers with five hundred taels of silver. The military officers did not accept.

Sun Yat-sen, Hu Hanmin, and Chen Shaobai traveled from Singapore to Hong Kong.

### Voice of the Reader

— Yangde Layman

My most admired and only teacher, —Shen Bao— was born in the eleventh year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty (i.e., 1872 in the Gregorian calendar). At that time, the Manchus were in power, and the court regulations were mostly disordered. The憔悴 abused people mostly harbored resentment and tolerated abuse. The land sighed in isolation, and all news was gone. The wind and rain were as dark as night, and there was no way to express what was contained. Once the Shen Bao came out, it became a mouthpiece for expression, and assisted both sides in communicating. Therefore, the Shen Bao's merit in supporting the people's hearts and shifting the atmosphere was not small. When the Republic of China was founded, there were all kinds of reforms. The Shen Bao also gradually evolved at this time. Mr. Shi Liangcai's keen planning and careful reorganization made the business flourish, and sales spread overseas. Up to now, it not only holds the center of the national public opinion circle, but also witnesses the thick expectations of the world's audio-visual.

Since the "July 7th" Incident triggered the Sino-Japanese War, the Shen Bao has still appealed for justice and humanity from the standpoint of the nation and the nation. Its spirit of perseverance and hardship has also been witnessed by the world. But unfortunately, the national army retreated westward, Shanghai fell, and the situation was like 荆棘铜驼, both laughing and crying. In this helpless environment, the Shen Bao, for the sake of eliminating the darkness of justice and for the sake of the last breath of freedom, resolutely issued a cessation of publication announcement. Starting from December 15th of that year, it ceased contact with me. When I heard this news, I was completely astonished. The Shen Bao had this unexpected encounter of distress and danger, which is indeed regrettable. The Shen Bao has this firm and outstanding spirit of sacrifice, which is truly admirable. On the day of the National Day last year, the newspaper met readers again. Therefore, all of us with the same hobby still followed the admiration of the past and scrambled to subscribe. The content has not diminished from the past. It can indeed fight against the evil environment regardless of everything, and its spirit is the most commendable.

On this anniversary of the resumption of publication, I dare to express my humble opinions:

1. The only condition for the resumption of publication of the Shen Bao is to advance with the war and work hard for the country. Judging from the current situation, the flames of war are continuous, and the wars are endless. The loyal and brave soldiers are fighting fiercely. China will never change its national policy of resisting Japan until the lost land is recovered and the national shame is washed away. The final victory must belong to us. The writer earnestly hopes that the readers of this newspaper will unanimously support the government's national policy and move forward.

2. The Shen Bao has a sound newspaper style and a glorious history. Its comments are fair and bright, and its news is detailed and accurate. It is recognized by Chinese and foreign people. In recent years, sales have increased day by day, and this is the reason. It is hoped that the Shen Bao readers at home and abroad will take care of this mouthpiece of public opinion. (Omitted below) Yangde Layman sincerely presents

After the liberation, Qing official Rui Cheng fled and hid. This newspaper had a limerick on November 6th of the Xinhai year as follows:

Rui Cheng has gone like the yellow crane, leaving only the Yellow Crane Tower in this place; once Rui Cheng leaves, he will never return, and Wuchang will be long and long for thousands of years.

### Comparison of Food and Cloth Prices between the Year of Xinhai and This Year

During a national revolution, everything in society moves with political turmoil. This is a certain trend. Prices, of course, are no exception, so it can be said that prices were already rising at that time, but compared with current prices, it still gives people the feeling of a little witch seeing a big witch. Below is a brief excerpt of several items, to get a glimpse.

October of the third year of Xuantong

Nantuan machine white cloth 10 yuan 3 jiao per dan, second grade 9 yuan 3 jiao
Machine new japonica rice 9 yuan 5 jiao, second grade 8 yuan 8 jiao

Anecdotes of Famous Actors

### The Revolutionary Work of Pan Yueqiao and Xia Yuerun

— Su Shaoqing

The Shanghai response to the Xinhai Revolution was very early, and the battle to attack the Arsenal was glorious in party history. The actor Pan Yueqiao was actually one of the initiators. Now that the Double Ten is here, in remembrance of the difficulties of the pioneers in creating the country, the historical traces of Mr. Pan Yueqiao should be written to tell the people and the acting world. Pan has an autobiography, which was published in newspapers. The text has missing parts and can be used as historical material. What is recorded here is his anecdote.

The picture on the left is Pan Yueqiao

Showing His Talents as a Young Man

Yueqiao lived in Changshu, originally from Ganquan County, Yangzhou. His father's name was Fuyun, and his birth mother was Hou. His childhood name was Liansheng. He lost his father at the age of seven and was abused by his sister-in-law, suffering greatly. He was able to perform on stage at the age of nine, and was hired to come to Shanghai by the Tianxian Tea Garden at the age of sixteen. He became popular as soon as he sang. The annual contract fee was 1,600 taels of silver. At that time, not many actors had a monthly contract fee of more than one hundred taels, let alone child actors. It can be seen how popular he was.

Sang More Than 300 New Plays in 22 Years

Yueqiao sang in Tianxian's troupe for a total of 22 years. He sang the serialized play "Iron Rooster" which was very popular. His revolutionary ideas were probably already conceived in the plays of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Later, he switched to the Danggui Troupe and then joined forces with the Xia brothers to form the Xin Wutai in the Sixteen Shops, rehearsing new plays such as "The Martyr Pan Throws Himself into the Sea". At this time, his friends such as Yao Boxin were all leaders in the business world, and his revolutionary ambition became stronger. Therefore, in September of Xinhai, he advocated the attack on the Arsenal.

Kneeling and Crying, His Left Foot Injured

When attacking the Arsenal, Pan knelt on the ground and cried, begging the artillerymen to fire the cannons. The cannonballs hit the big iron gate and did not break it. Pan climbed the wall to ask the gatekeepers, and they opened the gate. After the attack was successful, he returned to the Chamber of Commerce and learned that his left foot was injured and bleeding a lot.

Abandoning Acting and Serving as Brigade Commander for Seven Days

Cen Xilin was in charge of the Sichuan-Guangdong Railway and appointed Pan as the railway brigade commander. Pan resigned from the Xin Wutai Troupe and went to Hubei to take office. The Hubei army mostly leaned towards Yuan Shikai and had a tendency to rebel. Pan knew that he could not stay for long, so he hurriedly boarded a ship with Cen Xilin and fled to Shanghai. He had only served as brigade commander for seven days.

Disguised as a Monk to Escape Danger

After the second failure in Shanghai, Pan returned to Changshu to recuperate. Zheng Ruicheng sent military police to arrest him. Early in the morning, someone sent a message to inform him. He hurriedly changed into a monk's attire and escaped to the Zhongfeng Temple and then to Shanghai.

Losing 80,000 in Property and Suffering Poverty in His Later Years

Yuan Shikai ordered his arrest, and he was to be executed on the spot when captured. With the help of Lan Tianwei, Vice President Li, and Changre Shanghai gentry, the arrest was finally cancelled. He lost more than 80,000 in family property and returned to the stage. He first joined the Danggui Troupe and then moved to the Xin Wutai in Nine Acres (rebuilt after the fire). The amount of the contract fee was only 3,000 yuan per year. Later, he went to the two Guangdongs to be an official twice. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, he returned to Shanghai due to coughing up blood. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, he encountered Shen Hongying's rebellion and returned in a state of embarrassment. He was sick for many years. His later years were decadent. At the age of 58, he said in his autobiography, "Pawning and changing things, all kinds of difficulties entered into a poor village." The end of a hero is also sad.

Attached Xia Yueshan and Xia Yuerun

Xia Yueheng, Yueshan, and Yuerun are the sons of the old actor Xia Kuizhang. Yueheng abandoned acting in his prime and joined Duanfang as a military officer. Yueshan and Yuerun had novel ideas and bold creations. They first managed the Danggui Tea Garden, and later Pan Yueqiao each invested in organizing the Xin Wutai in the Sixteen Shops, rehearsing many new plays, and taking the lead in the trend. Pan Yueqiao led people to attack the Arsenal, and the Xia brothers also helped. Yueshan originally practiced Laosheng (old male role), and later also played丑角 (clown role). I once saw him perform as Monk Ji Dian, speaking in the southern dialect, which was humorous and delightful. Yuerun practiced Wusheng (martial male role) and married Tan Xinpei's daughter. He told me personally that when he went to Beiping to greet her in person, Lao Tan ordered him to perform a play for three days in the Zhonghe Garden, actually testing his artistic ability to be worthy of being a son-in-law. On the first day, he performed "Flower Butterfly", climbed the railing, and showed off his skills, and public opinion was convinced. In the twenty-seventh year of Guangxu, he managed the Danggui and once invited his father-in-law to perform. Due to a disagreement, in the second year of Xuantong, he again invited Mr. Tan to perform at the Xin Wutai in the Sixteen Shops, which he managed. His wife went north to pick him up. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, he again invited Tan Xinpei to perform at the Xin Wutai in Nine Acres, performing for a total of ten days. Three times invited Tan, all due to kinship. When Yuerun was at his peak, as the president of the Actors' Association, people called him "Eighth Boss" instead of his name, seemingly the king of the Shanghai acting world. When he was down on his luck in his later years, he lived in the Jingtu Nunnery in Zhabei as a monk and died of illness in the nunnery. This happened half a month before the January 28th Incident.

A History of Cutting Braids

### The Ugly System of the Manchu Qing Dynasty Has Been Accumulated for a Long Time and Become a Custom. The National System Is Renovated and the National Shame Is Eradicated.

Keeping braids was an ugly custom of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. After the Xinhai Restoration, all provincial military governments issued orders to cut braids. The Guangdong Military Government had a haircut order stating: "According to the fact that the Republic of China has been established, and the people are renewing themselves, the first thing to do is to wash away the smelly customs. ... Braids were the customs of the southwestern barbarians in the Han Dynasty, and the customs of the Jurchens in the Song Dynasty. The Manchus of today are another kind of Jurchen. In the second year of Shunzhi in the Qing Dynasty, Yi You, in the sixth month of the leap year, a shaving order was issued, and those who violated it would be killed without pardon. Therefore, our people all had braids hanging behind them.

General Order for National Haircuts

It has now come to this. How can our countrymen not mourn the country when they think about where the braids came from? It should be known that the old customs of our country were all to tie the hair into a bun, only between Wu and Yue, there were those who wished to cut their hair, and there were those who cut it, but there was no one who braided their hair. Braids are not a rite of our country. From now on, all of our countrymen should cut their braids to eradicate the national shame. Learn from the past, don't need to restore the custom of tying the hair, imitate the West, and hope to have the customs of Wu and Yue. Alas! Our countrymen should think about it! The rise of customs and rituals is to promote the eyes and ears, and the matters involved are not small. Patriots, there is no one who does not love customs and rituals. Wash away the dirt of old ideas, obey the orders of renovation, for this general announcement, follow it as one, sincerely..." and so on.

The Braid-Cutting Meeting in Daishan

However, at that time, the people's wisdom was not yet enlightened. Although the military governments in various places exhorted earnestly, the people were still attached to the ugly customs and still regarded this pigtail as forbidden, and refused to cut it. Therefore, there were braid-cutting meetings held in various places. Those who initiated this kind of movement mostly had newer heads. The common methods were also mostly to take "collective" action. For example, the news about the Braid-Cutting Meeting in Daishan, Dinghai, Zhejiang, published in this newspaper in October of the Xinhai year said: "Daishan in Dinghai Hall is isolated in the sea, and the atmosphere is simple. A few days ago, Zheng Ruichen, Yuan Ziqing, Jiang Chenqing, and Wang Tingsheng initiated a braid-cutting meeting at the Daidet Hall at 2 pm on September 23. The four gentlemen first cut off their own braids and explained the reasons, roughly saying: "We have been enslaved by braids for 260 years. Now that the military government of the Republic of China is hanging the people and punishing the guilty, and the provinces are gradually recovering, our fellow countrymen, the dignified descendants of the Han, should quickly cut off the rotten things. Why are you willing to be slaves like cattle and horses for a long time?" At this time, the audience was like a wall, counting more than 200 people, clapping thunderously, and rising in the wind. There were many people willing to cut it. It did not disperse until five o'clock."

The Braid-Cutting Meeting in Suzhou

The report also said about the situation of the braid-cutting meeting in Suzhou: "Since the Staff Office of the Military Government issued a notice to advise cutting braids, yesterday, someone and someone opened a special braid-cutting meeting at the Wang Renxiao Shrine in Hulong Street. A large number of people arrived at that time, and all signed up to be willing to cut. From then on, the pigtails were not left, which could avoid the ridicule of Westerners," and so on. However, at that time, most of the old leftovers were still watching, which led to the occurrence of various interesting anecdotes about the military police forcibly cutting braids.

Free Talk

### The Resurrection of Freedom

— W.C. Bryant, translated by Zhou Weiyin

Freedom! Thou art not, as poets dream,
A fair young girl, with light and delicate frame,
And crown of flowers, and ringlets waving free,
A Mænad from the mountains wild,
Or radiant huntress, when the chase is done,
With weary limbs and cheeks of glowing red;
But stern of brow, and strong of arm,
A matron such as Rome had borne of old,
Whose iron hand made empire wide.

Thou art a bearded man,
Girt about with strength as with a cloth,
And wielding in thy hand a heavy sword,
To strike down tyranny, though armed in mail;
And thou hast known full well the bitter taste
Of slavery, and thou art not one
To shrink when danger lowers, or yield a field
Where Freedom's battle-flag has once been planted.

They tell us in our schools
How often Rome, when young, was put to flight,
By wild barbarians, and how often too,
With her proud eagle, she turned back upon them,
And drove them in confusion from the land;
And so may we, when danger threatens us,
With Freedom's banner, drive back the invader.

They tell us how the Greeks, in days of old,
Defended their dear land with sword in hand,
And drove the Persian host from off their shores;
And so may we, when danger threatens us,
With Freedom's banner, drive back the invader.

The cruel power, with his lightning strikes you;
They cannot extinguish your innate life,
Though cruel power has built for you the deep prison;
His Hessian armor,
Used thousands of flames,
Forged into your chains;
But, when he thought you were bound,
The links were shattered to pieces,
The prison wall has collapsed;
You surprisingly jump out,
Like a burning flame jumping from the woodpile,
Shouting to this nation,
In the whole nation responding to your call,
The pale-faced oppressor hides and escapes.

### Night Street

— Ding Di

I don't necessarily yearn for distant mountains and forests, waves and bridges, plains, or vast expanses. I also enjoy strange imaginations, envisioning many different night streets.

A friend told me about the night street:

"Let me tell you, we have excellent city streets here. It's just not as you imagine, in the daytime, under the sunlight. On the contrary, it's at night. Often, when the moonlight quietly slips out of the clouds, near the cliffs along the river, a black veil is cast on the water, vaguely shrouded in a layer of shadow. At this time, the streets are bustling with voices. People who have been cooped up at home all day, old ladies supporting their children, stagger onto the main street, tirelessly nagging the shopkeepers. People from the countryside return from the countryside. Children jump and bump around in the shadows. On this night street, the shops are not very orderly, scattered sporadically in the caves of the cliffs.

I can't forget that one night. I went to the night street in the valley to buy something, and as I was about to go home, I was a little tired. A few friends and I sat in the park along the river for a while. The moonlight was like mercury poured on a bright mirror. On this side of the bank, a tall forest, the mountain shadows wrapped around the long night street like a large bundle. We sat in the dark and watched the moon. The bright light on the grass on the opposite bank made us seem even darker. Suddenly, majestic singing rose up behind us, and I couldn't help but be moved by them. Their songs revealed laughter and also told of bitterness. They had life, strength, and passion. I couldn't help but sigh. I was reminded of a night in my hometown two years ago. Under the moonlight, by the river, the same passionate singing—you haven't forgotten it either, have you?

"Homesick? I don't want to assume that. Because I feel very good here. The sun, the air, the passion of the flames, everything suits me well. Especially the night street, it's extremely interesting and extremely moving. Okay, imagine—lights scattered among the forests and valleys at the foot of the mountains along the river, with the crude figures of people stirring... That's the night street, that's the night street."

I read it and wrote a reply. What particularly caught my attention was a question:

"Are you really homesick?"

Three months later, a reply came:

"No, I'm really not homesick at all. I'm very good here. I love the night street here. In the night street, the mountain air blends with unfamiliar hearts. Allow me to retract my previous statement. I no longer plan to reminisce."

Regarding the night street, how can I not reminisce? I wrote a letter, writing about my hometown two years ago and a similar section, expressing my envy for the night street in the valley.

"What you remember, I have not forgotten either. On the narrow street paved with bluestone, the signs on the left-hand side almost touch the eaves of the houses on the right. Walking on the uneven road, people squeezed together to pass. In the dark alleyways, in the late autumn, there is the sound of an iron shovel scraping against a pot, that is, the seller of fried ginkgo nuts. From a desolate road, you can often see a group of passengers coming down from the late train at the station, the oil lamps on the rickshaws forming a long string. You can hear the barking of dogs in the remote alleys. A few rays of light leak out from the cracks in the wooden door of the small inn, welcoming customers with warmth…"

After writing it, I regretted it. I just put the letter down and didn't mail it. I simply wrote a few other lines:

"I imagined it and envied it... Lights scattered among the forests and valleys at the foot of the mountains along the river, with the crude figures of people stirring. I love the sun, the air, the passion of the flames there... Ah, especially the night street, the night street…"

He really doesn't need to be homesick. He has something more lovable than his hometown. Life is more fulfilling, people are more passionate, the streets are more interesting, and nature is even greater.

But I can't help but feel a kind of nostalgia. On a brightly lit night, the sky sparkles with red and green neon lights. Vehicles like cunning rabbits chasing the wind are constantly running and flowing. The sounds of people and cars mix into a burst of noise on the road. There is dust and powder in the air… Isn't this also a night street? A night street where people with full pockets indulge to their heart's content?… I can't help but write down a little envy or reminiscence:

"The night street of my hometown makes me reminisce, and the night street of the valley makes me envy. I can't help but fantasize."

I sent another letter to my friend.

### Fallen Leaves

— Xiao Fang

Sitting in the garden, the leaves on the branches fell down with a rhythm, occasionally floating onto my friend. She fiddled with them carefully. (Was she studying whether they were parallel-veined or reticulate-veined?)

"It's really strange, the leaves always fall in autumn." This imaginative friend was a little sentimental about the very ordinary natural phenomenon, and then imitated Prince Hamlet's soliloquy, resting her chin on her hand. I was silent.

"Why don't you say anything? Weren't you just complaining about not being able to take a philosophy of life course because of a time conflict? Actually, that doesn't matter much. Life is alive, textbooks are dead; you can't learn anything in the university classroom. But, think about the fate of these leaves! It will help you understand the mysteries of life."

So, I picked up a fallen leaf and fiddled with it too. From being green and exciting to see, to being a withered yellow, is the course of its life. Just like flowers blooming and falling, the good times of a full moon and a crescent moon do not last long. I was reminded of a pile of rise and fall of people and events. And melancholy covered my field of thought like a veil, and I couldn't help but feel a little tired.

"The west wind sweeps away the fallen leaves. They will inevitably drift in the world and destroy their traces." My friend said, her serious appearance like a philosopher. "But, after the cold winter, new leaves will grow. Compared to the universe, the life of an individual is only a small point of nothing, so naturally, there is no need to despise its existence. However, one must recognize that people should pave the way and build bridges for the whole and future generations. Do you understand?"

I was brought into a deeper realm, and remained silent; wanting to think about it quietly for a while longer. I knew I was lacking a bit of health.

### "Change"

— Mu Chang

The conflict and struggle between opposing things is inevitable, and only then can a higher stage be reached. This is inevitable in the course of history, and is called "change." Hegel has spoken of it in detail.

Let me give an example from history: Wang Mang, a man of petty cunning, and Li Zicheng, a bandit from Mizhi, may seem distressing and frightening to some historians; however, if they had handled political and economic policies and mass movements well at the time, later historians might have added the glorious title of "Emperor Gaozu" to them. But can we say that their "change" was accidental? Of course not!

Shang Yang abolished the "well-field system"(?), equalized weights and measures, and went against the ancient ways. If you apply gentleness and sincerity to it, it would inevitably lead to the pursuit of legalism, meanness, and even to his own destruction, being torn apart by chariots, which seems like a pity; but explaining it from the perspective of the rise of the commercial bourgeoisie at that time is naturally not as simple as the imagination of moralists.

The most bizarre thing in history is Wang Anshi, although Liang Qichao later regarded him as one of the greatest statesmen. It seems that there is no real evidence that he usurped the throne, and it is too wrong to say that he was a robber "wandering around". "Heavenly changes are not to be feared, ancestral laws are not to be followed, and people's words are not to be cherished" is already outside the classics, but even more hated by the likes of Su Xun is that he "talks about poetry and books while wearing mourning clothes." Being unkempt is like begging, and singing lotus chants would be fine, but he insists on talking about poetry and books, "filling the role of a Confucian," and from this he "reforms the law"; and his literary skills are so high that he can write excellent articles, so he is inevitably worse than Lu Qi, simply a flood or a beast. So, oppose, oppose!

The reason for the opposition lies in complacency, conservatism, and the maintenance of one's own interests—"change" is troublesome, wouldn't the status of the old landlords and bourgeoisie be shaken as a result? Indeed, Wang Anshi's reform was aimed at all the bad systems in the agricultural society at that time, and in general, it acknowledged the interests of the middle peasants, which would undoubtedly give the great landlords and bourgeoisie a severe blow. Look: the "Green Sprouts Law" used the cash from the state and county granaries to help the common people, so that they could cultivate in time, which precisely eliminated the exploitation of usury; the "Market Regulation Law" lent capital to small merchants to regulate social supply, so that large commercial capital could not monopolize and hoard goods for profit; and the "Order of Law Enforcement" also prevented landlord bureaucrats from manipulating and embezzling funds; the "Baojia Law" stabilized the locality and eliminated bandits, but when the war of resistance broke out, the national conscription would inevitably cause trouble for the landlords' young masters, which was also unacceptable to them!

What they did was to muddle along, "passing away like this, and never returning; waxing and waning like that, and never decreasing or increasing." The "change" in the world is an "illusion", and I was there from the beginning? "You can look at it from the perspective of its unchanging nature, and things and I are all endless." Drink and sing, how long is life? "The clear wind on the river, the bright moon among the mountains," come on, be intoxicated. "What I and you enjoy together, jibber jabber!" Regardless of the invasion of the northeast Liao, the rise of the northwest Western Xia, the frequent foreign troubles over the years, and the great social unrest, jibber jabber—I want to order wine, hiccup! However, from a historical point of view, not only because of ordering wine, "hearing" is a warning, but Wang Anshi's heroic performance of "change" may also be a wake-up call: although he had a ruthless conflict with his opponents, he did not get the greater sympathy of the lower class and have a good connection with them; and the bureaucrats Cai Jing and Zhang Dun, whom he used in administration, actually fulfilled the task of profiting from it and not benefiting the lower class. No wonder Wang Anshi left a stain in the history of Chinese political movements.

"Change" is inevitable, and subjective promotion must have "strength"; is the "person" who "does not care about people's words" the masses or the minority?

On the other hand, we must point out: there is also no "unchanging thing" in the intoxicated enjoyment of drinking wine; Ruan the bearded man desperately devoted himself to "nine wrongs and ten wrongs", but he still performed between banquets, only "changing to death."

### National Day and the Performing Arts Circle

— Xin Ying

Today is Double Ten National Day, which reminds me of the activities of the performing arts circle on National Day in the past. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the performing arts circle was very active on National Day, truly a so-called celebration throughout the land.

Just speaking of Shanghai, on National Day, general cinemas, whether showing domestic or foreign films, would choose good new films, and regardless of sunny or rainy weather, every show would be full, with a grand scene no less than the Winter Solstice and New Year. Therefore, some cinemas had to add one or two more shows. In addition to paid movies, there were also free movies, which were borrowed by the authorities and shown to the public for free. At the same time, the movie employees of various film companies also had to hold a grand celebration.

Beijing opera theaters were no exception. On this day, famous actors would adjust their lineups and perform famous plays.

In the amusement parks, every troupe performed wonderful performances, and each artist would say a few auspicious words to celebrate the Double Ten when they took the stage. Dance halls were also open all night, with particularly lively dancers, celebrating all night, like Christmas and New Year.

In addition, there were also non-professional artists from schools and groups performing various performances, opening grand variety shows: crosstalk, music, dramas, the lively situation is difficult to describe in words.

Now that Shanghai has become an "isolated island," although it is National Day, it is far from as lively as in the past. We can only recall the past situation and hope that China's final victory will come soon, and after Shanghai returns to its original state, we can see this grand scene of National Day again!

### Actress Song Dezhu Talks About: Practicing Qiao Gong and Fighting Hand to Hand (Part 1)

— Recorded by Leng Fang

Editor's introduction: Song Dezhu, courtesy name Yingzhi, is from Tianjin, 23 years old, and is a rising talent among the "Four Little Famous Dan" in the old capital, uniquely skilled in both civil and military arts, and renowned at the time. This is her first time coming to the south, and her performance at the "Golden Stage" has been a sensation, demonstrating her true talent and skills. This reputation is well-deserved. This self-description of her acting experience shows her deep dedication and the great difficulty of martial arts plays, which is also very interesting.

### Random Notes on Artists

I am a junior actor in the theatrical world. I entered the Peking Opera School in Beiping at the age of fourteen and studied for seven and a half years until graduating in the summer of the year before last. Since then, I have formed my own troupe, the Yingguang Society, and performed locally for less than two years. I know that my skills are still shallow and I need to work harder and seek guidance from all aspects. Therefore, what I am willing to say can only be limited to my experience and humble opinions on learning and practicing acting.

First Learning Martial Arts

I was in the first class at the opera school. Therefore, the school followed the "De He Jin Yu…" ranking, and I was in the De class, so my stage name is Dezhu. The opera school rules stipulated that, except for martial arts, there was "women playing women, men playing men." I originally only specialized in martial arts plays; later, the school authorities believed that I had a good talent and was very suitable for singing Qingyi and Huashan plays, so they were willing to break the rules and began to teach me Huadan. I remember this happened in the fourth year of entering the school. The vice-principal, Mr. Li Boyan, came to the school at seven o'clock every morning to play the erhu and warm up my voice. He was very enthusiastic and cared for me very much, and he was particularly strict with me. He even broke the erhu because I was not very focused, using it as a powerful stimulus. At the same time, it was obvious that the principal was too fond of a student when he played the instrument, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the students. Mr. Li still remained the same, without any consideration. Therefore, being able to sing civil plays with this voice after learning martial arts is really all thanks to Mr. Li's creation, and I will always be grateful and unforgettable.

Guidance from Famous Teachers

When I first learned martial arts plays, I was guided by Yu Yuqin, Guo Jixiang, Zhu Guifang, and Yan Shaoqiu. Mr. Yu's name was Zhuang, and he specialized in martial arts, and he was also the creator of the "Thirteenth Sister" play. Mr. Guo's stage name was Shui Xianhua, and he played both Huadan and martial arts. His qiao gong was really too good. Mr. Zhu and Yan (also known as Jiuzhenfeng) were both excellent famous actors in the martial arts line. Therefore, after years of training, I was able to achieve a little success in martial arts, which was all due to the guidance of these good teachers. But unfortunately, Mr. Yu and others have long since passed away, and I have no possibility of receiving further instruction!

### Shirley Temple's Merry-Go-Round

— Hua Zhi

Behind the Twentieth Century Fox studio in Hollywood, there is a large garden dedicated to filming outdoor scenes. There are models of many world-famous attractions in the garden, such as the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the streets of New York, and the pyramids of Egypt, with realistic scenery. There is also a delicate electric merry-go-round, which is specially for the top child star Shirley Temple to play with. Originally, Shirley Temple was very active by nature. When filming became impatient, she became sleepy and listless, and went on strike. The director could not do anything, so he consulted with a child psychologist, and according to the plan, he built a merry-go-round in the pavilion of the back garden, so that when she felt tired, she could ride the horse and circle around, stimulating her spirit. The installation of the pavilion is an active dance floor with a rotating axis in the middle and eight wooden horses around it, covered with embroidered saddles, swaying and running very fast. After Shirley Temple rides the wooden horse, she becomes energetic and willing to continue filming. In the beginning, the director thought this was just a way to deal with children, but after a long time, the other adult actors also became addicted to riding horses like Shirley Temple, and they could not pass the audition without it. Therefore, Miss Shirley Temple's eight wooden horses have a tendency to never stop all day long, and more and more comrades are riding horses.

"Wu Zetian" will be staged at the Xuan Palace today. The theater will add a performance of "Sai Jinhua" at 9:30 this morning to celebrate National Day. The picture above shows Xia Xia in the costume of Wu Zetian.

### The Feminine Elegance Art in the Mouth of a Female Star

Zorina, this elegant woman, is a famous Hollywood dance star. She started practicing dance in kindergarten. She said that every woman can become elegant, but just pay attention to a few simple rules.

She said that when a woman sits, she should avoid posing; but she must remember to be calm—a woman should have a calm and leisurely attitude. She should cross her ankles, not her knees. Sit on the chair at an angle, and place her hands naturally on her knees.

A lively and lovely appearance can create a vivid and agile personality. When a woman is in action, she can show her liveliness and attract attention, but this action must be elegant and dignified.

Zorina said that when walking, one must have a graceful posture, using the legs to focus on the toes, using the arms elegantly, and using them in a balanced manner.

When standing still, the body should be sideways, not directly facing the front. When speaking to people, one foot should be slightly forward, and the weight of the body should be supported on the other foot. (Xie)
