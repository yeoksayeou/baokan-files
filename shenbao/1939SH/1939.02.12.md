### President Chiang Discusses Attacking Hainan Island Regarding Japan
Striving to Intervene to Prevent Easy Occupation.
Victory or Defeat in the War of Resistance Depends on Mainland Warfare. The Gain or Loss of One Island is Fundamentally Unimportant.
Britain and France Have Jointly Proposed Demands to Japan.

(Chongqing) President Chiang, on the morning of the 11th, responded to inquiries from foreign journalists and expressed his views on the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island as follows: Question: What is the real intention behind Japan's recent advance into Hainan Island? Answer: Regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, we can recognize its significance and major impact by observing the entire situation of the Far Eastern seas. Hainan Island is a major strategic center in East Asia, between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. If the Japanese army occupies the island, it can not only completely block transportation between Hong Kong and Singapore and cut off the connection between Singapore and Australia but also put the Philippines under its control. This not only directly threatens French Indochina but is also the beginning of complete control over naval power in the Pacific. If the island falls into the hands of the Japanese army, the Japanese navy can look toward the Mediterranean Sea from the Indian Ocean in the west, and in the east, it can cut off the connection between the British and American naval bases of Singapore, Hawaii, and Pearl Harbor. Therefore, this move by the Japanese army is clearly a response to the American fleet's visit to Singapore last year. Question: Why is this move by Japan the beginning of controlling naval power in the Pacific? Answer: We all know that Japan has three most important strategic strongholds in the Pacific: Sakhalin Island in the north, Hainan Island in the west, and Guam in the east. If Japan wants to gain complete control of the sea, it cannot forget these three places. If all three fall into Japan's hands, then the Philippines and Hawaii will be equivalent to being occupied by Japan. Currently, Japan has already occupied half of Sakhalin Island, and now it is attempting to occupy Hainan Island to block the British navy from connecting eastward with the United States. If this plan is not obstructed, Japan will further seek to control Guam. This will not only prevent the American navy from moving westward but also cut off its connection with the Philippines. To carry out its southward policy and dominate the Pacific, Japan has been meticulously planning to create a connecting line between these three major strongholds for thirty years. When Japan created the so-called North Sea Incident in the 25th year of the Republic (1936), its intention was to use it as an excuse to advance into Hainan Island. However, due to fear of various countries, it did not dare to launch it. Now, it is resolutely disregarding everything and openly invading Hainan Island. If it is not intending to provoke a world war, it is one of the last and riskiest moves in its military aggression against China. After hesitating for decades, it has now resolutely implemented it. This is not only the first and largest event since the start of the Sino-Japanese War but also the only key to changing the Pacific situation in thirty years. Now that Japan has revealed its ambitions, any country with deep ties to the Far East cannot allow this dangerous attempt to run rampant. It is important to know that in Japan's entire naval strategy, Hainan Island is the second gateway for Japan in the western Pacific, and Guam is the second gateway for Japan in the eastern Pacific. Question: Then where is Japan's first gateway, the most forward one, in the east? President Chiang smiled and replied, "This is already well known to people in Europe and America, and Americans must know it even better. There is no need to elaborate." Question: To what extent will Japan's occupation of Hainan Island affect peace in the Far East? Answer: To answer this question, it must be known that Japan's advance into Hainan Island on February 10th of this year (1939) is equivalent to the occupation of Shenyang on September 18th (1931). In other words, Japan's attack on Hainan Island is tantamount to creating a "September 18th Incident" in the Pacific. The land may have differences between land and sea, but the impact is completely the same. Recalling the Shenyang Incident, except for the then US Secretary of State Stimson, the authorities of other countries did not pay attention to it. Japan was able to continue to expand its aggression, and now, eight years later, it has created a situation of brazenly dominating East Asia and increasing its arrogance to conquer the world. Now Japan is attacking Hainan Island again. If it is allowed to occupy and entrenched itself, I expect that its designed naval and air force base will be initially completed in less than eight months. Then the situation in the Pacific will suddenly change drastically. Even if France wants to set up a naval base in Indochina and the United States wants to fortify Guam, there will be no time to wait. Therefore, Japan's resolute southward advance is not to end the Sino-Japanese war but proves that it is willing to take the last risk to create the beginning of a Pacific war. Question: What arrangements does China have for Hainan Island? Answer: Because China has no navy, it cannot defend the coastline. However, it has long prepared all land-based arrangements and will do its best to fight the enemy on the island and will never allow them to easily occupy it. As for the Japanese army's invasion of Beihai, we have made thorough arrangements and preparations and will give them a strong blow. Moreover, this move has no meaning in the enemy's invasion of China itself and will only put them in a more unfavorable position, which is understood by general military observers. Question: What impact does the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island have on the Sino-Japanese war? Answer: The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island does not have a significant impact on our country's war of resistance because the victory or defeat of the Sino-Japanese war must depend on military actions on the mainland. The occupation of one island has fundamentally nothing to do with us. (11th dispatch)

(Paris) Responsible sources here recently stated that regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, the British and French governments have instructed their ambassadors to Japan to make representations to the Japanese government, demanding an explanation of the reasons, nature, and duration of the occupation. (Havas Agency dispatch on the 11th)

(Hong Kong) Hong Kong received a radio report this morning that the French fleet had arrived in Haikou from Guangzhou Bay, with the number of ships unknown. It was also learned that Singapore Governor Tomes and his wife had arrived in Saigon and are scheduled to meet the Vietnamese Governor in Hue on the 11th to discuss Hainan Island and Far Eastern issues. The Vietnamese French authorities are extremely stimulated by the Japanese army's landing in Hainan and are investigating the situation in that area and are temporarily refusing to express their views. (Special dispatch at 10 PM on the 11th)

(Hong Kong) Foreign dispatch: After the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, the French warships in Guangzhou Bay were ordered to sail to Hainan and have now arrived at the Haikou sea area, but the number of ships is unknown. (Dispatch on the 11th)

(Hong Kong) According to a radio report received here, the French fleet originally stationed in Guangzhou Bay has suddenly arrived at the entrance of Haikou at the northern end of Hainan Island. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 11th)

(Paris) The report that French warships are currently near Hainan Island has been confirmed by the French Foreign Ministry this afternoon. It is said that the warships near Hainan Island intend to investigate the current situation of the island on the spot, to what extent the Japanese army has actually implemented the occupation. France has no intention of demonstrating strength. As for the activities of French warships in Guangzhou Bay and Tokyo Bay, there is nothing unusual about them. French political figures believe that France's naval strength in the Far East is not strong and may not take heavy actions. Britain and France are consulting on the incident of Japan occupying Hainan Island, and they will raise a joint protest. The content has not yet been released. (Everyday News Agency dispatch on the 11th)

(Paris) Regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China, responsible sources here recently stated that the French government has instructed its ambassador to Japan, Henri, to request the Japanese government to explain the reasons, nature, and duration of the occupation. The British government has also decided to make the same representations. British Ambassador Sir Phipps consulted with French Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday, and the two governments will continue to maintain close contact. Responsible sources here also said that the Japanese army's move is due to two reasons: First, it may be afraid that foreign arms will be transported to China via French Vietnam. Regarding this, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the French government has taken a proper attitude, even going beyond the scope of treaty obligations, and has repeatedly provided guarantees to the Japanese government. Second, it may be because the Japanese government intends to send Masanosuke Tani as its ambassador to France, but the French government has not agreed. In fact, France has long stated that it has no dissatisfaction with Tani personally and even greatly respects him. What the French government expects is that Tani's remarks regarding the Chinese government's purchase of arms via Vietnam should be corrected, which is also a proper move, it is said. (Havas Agency dispatch on the 11th)

(London) Regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China, French Ambassador Corbin visited Sir Cadogan of the Foreign Office this morning to discuss the issue of British and French ambassadors jointly making representations to the Japanese government. As generally known, if the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is of a long-term nature, then Britain and France should consider various means of self-defense, even retaliatory means, to deal with it. British political figures also said that after the Japanese army occupies the island, the threat to Britain is the same as that to France. Britain and France are completely aligned. This was clearly stated by Prime Minister Chamberlain in his speech in the House of Commons on the 6th of this month. Now that the Hainan Island issue has arisen, the two countries have encountered an opportunity to practically demonstrate their alliance, it is said. (Havas Agency dispatch on the 11th)

### Chinese Troops in Haikou, Qiongzhou Transfer Positions

(Guangzhou Bay) The Japanese army landing on Hainan Island numbers about 5,000 to 6,000, advancing toward Haikou, Qiongzhou. Fierce fighting occurred. The Chinese defense forces had no choice but to transfer their positions due to the disparity in numbers. Fierce fighting is still taking place near Haikou and other places. According to a dispatch from Macau, Japanese warships have arrived in Haikou and landed troops. Haikou, Qiongzhou is in great fire, and residents are fleeing to the Leizhou Peninsula. The situation is also becoming tense. Transportation between Hainan Island and Macau has been cut off. (Special dispatch at 10 PM on the 11th)

(Chongqing) The fighting north of Qiongshan is fierce. Chinese troops are fighting hard. Large reinforcements of the Japanese army continue to land, circumventing the flanks of Qiongshan. Japanese commander Kondo, commander of the 3rd Destroyer Division, has arrived in Haikou. (Special dispatch at 9 PM on the 11th)

(Hong Kong) According to news received here, the troops stationed on Hainan Island under the command of General Zhang Da were transferred to the mainland of Guangdong Province to participate in the war when the Japanese army landed in Daya Bay. Therefore, the Chinese army offered less resistance when the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island. However, guerrillas are scattered throughout the island and will inevitably engage in a long-term struggle with the Japanese army. Last night, the Japanese army engaged in fierce fighting with the guerrillas. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 11th)

### Japan's Occupation of Hainan Proves Its Will is Completely Chaotic

(Hong Kong) Chinese figures here do not express surprise at the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island, believing that it is a further step in Japan's anti-British and anti-French stance. Hainan Island is of little importance to China's national defense, but its threat to the sea and air transportation between Vietnam, the Philippines, and even Hong Kong and Singapore is extremely serious. Chinese newspapers here generally believe that the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is a violation of the French-Japanese treaty. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 11th)

(Chongqing) Chinese newspapers here continue to comment on the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, all saying that this move proves that the Japanese army can no longer advance into the interior of China. The Central Daily News said that the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island shows that the Japanese army is now encountering strong resistance from the Chinese army in the interior. The Japanese government is worried about economic retaliation from Britain and the United States and is troubled by various problems and criticism from public opinion, resulting in its will being completely chaotic today and unable to decide its future policy. From the perspective of the Japanese army fighting in the interior, occupying Hainan has no military value. However, Japan's current position makes it difficult to confront the naval positions of Britain, France, and the United States in the South Pacific. It is obvious that the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island is only intended to reverse the various difficulties it is currently encountering in China in the eyes of the domestic and international community. The Xinhua Daily believes that the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is enough to threaten the position of Vietnam, Singapore, and the Philippines. The three countries of France, Britain, and the United States may not tolerate this move. However, China must not rely on foreign developments to cope with the overall situation but should strengthen the defense of South China to stop the Japanese army from invading the southwest and constantly strive to maintain transportation in the southwestern provinces. The Sao Dang newspaper said that Hainan Island was incorporated into Chinese territory in the Han Dynasty and has been so for more than 1,600 years. The National Government had planned to develop the island, but due to the war of resistance against Japan, it could not be realized. The Japanese army's occupation of the island is not only an invasion of Chinese territory but also directly endangers the position of France and Britain in the Pacific. The Ta Kung Pao said that Hainan Island is indeed an important naval base, but China has no navy, so the Japanese army's occupation is irrelevant to the future of China's war of resistance. However, will France still remain silent about it? Japan has repeatedly guaranteed not to harm the interests of third parties. Where is its guarantee? (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)

### Foreign Media Severely Criticizes Japanese Army's Landing on Hainan Island
Reasons for Occupation Untenable, Treaty Obligations Already Violated

(Paris) The media here unanimously condemned the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China in strong terms, saying that Japan had violated its obligations and exerted pressure on French Vietnam. The right-wing L'Écho de Paris stated, "The reasons cited by the Japanese government are absolutely untenable. The French government will definitely lodge a very strong protest, and other countries will certainly take similar action. The end of the war between China and Japan is still far away. We are far from the battlefield and have plenty of time to respond." The right-wing Le Matin also said that the French government will definitely lodge a protest. The right-wing Le Figaro stated, "The British and French governments, after exchanging views, have decided to lodge a protest with the Japanese government. As early as June 27th of last year, British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler stated in the House of Commons that the British and French governments had instructed their ambassadors to Japan to clearly notify the Japanese government that if Japan occupied Hainan Island, Britain and France would regard it as an act of deliberately causing unpleasant disputes. The British and French governments should assist each other to adapt to the needs of the situation, without any doubt." This statement is still valid today. The right-wing Le Journal stated, "The only goal of the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island is to prepare to cut off the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which is one of the remaining channels for China to receive foreign assistance." It does not seem appropriate to lodge a formal protest at this time. It would be better to take a vigilant attitude and, together with Britain, pay attention to future developments. Because if this island is occupied by Japan, the extent to which Britain feels threatened is actually equal to that of France. Other newspapers compared the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island with the Spanish Nationalists' occupation of the Mediterranean island of Menorca. The radical socialist L'Œuvre stated, "These two events are clear evidence that the German-Italian-Japanese tripartite alliance is secretly implementing its plan, which is to threaten the communication lines of the British and French democracies and put them at a disadvantage." The radical socialist La République stated that Germany and Italy were extremely dissatisfied with the attempts of Britain and France to mediate the Spanish Civil War. "The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island may be a retaliatory measure taken by the three countries that signed the Anti-Comintern Pact after mutual consultation, which is not necessarily the case." The right-wing Le Petit Journal stated, "If the Japanese army intends to occupy Hainan Island for a long time, it is another act of violating the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington. The United States, as the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty, should take the lead in declaring that the treaty has been violated and should make demands on Japan, take action, or conduct negotiations with it." (Havas dispatch on the 11th)

(Paris) After the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island in China, responsible sources here recently stated that the French government should make representations to the Japanese government, informing them that France's prohibition of arms from being transported to China via French Vietnam was in the hope that Japan would abandon its attempts on Hainan Island as an exchange condition. In addition, France and Japan had agreed on an issue regarding Hainan Island that any action that is detrimental to the other party should be avoided. France will certainly have reasons to argue. Britain and France should also take a common stance and consider joint action, which is also possible, but they should pay attention to developments and make a formal decision only after Japan explains its intentions. (Havas dispatch on the 10th)

(Paris) According to sources in Parisian political circles, the British and French governments will lodge sharp protests against the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. According to Le Journal and Le Figaro, British Ambassador Sir Phipps visited French Foreign Minister Bonnet last night and discussed the wording of the protest. However, it is not yet known whether Britain and France will protest to Tokyo separately or jointly. (Haitong dispatch on the 11th)

(Paris) The French government is currently paying close attention to the situation on Hainan Island. Responsible parties have not yet issued statements regarding France's views. However, it is expected that if Japan does not interfere with trade between Hainan Island and Vietnam, France may not lodge representations. (Reuters dispatch on the 10th)

(Paris) The French government is temporarily maintaining a patient attitude tonight regarding the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. Hainan Island is a military stronghold on the coast of South China. Japanese warships and aircraft can now threaten French Indochina from there. Officials stated that the government will pursue diplomatic channels or consult with the British government before lodging a protest against Japan's actions. However, according to the impression gained by officials, France does not seem likely to turn this into an incident at present. French officials said that Japan's actions have not violated France's rights and interests on the island, whether under the Sino-French Agreement of 1897 or the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907. However, it is a fundamental violation of the promises recently made by Japan to Britain and France. Although the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is enough to threaten French territory, the French government is now awaiting Japan to reveal its true intentions for the island. France apparently does not object to Japan's temporary occupation of the island, but the Japanese army must withdraw from the island when China restores peace. (Associated Press dispatch on the 10th)

(Paris) The French newspapers today all oppose the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island. Several newspapers advocated that the French government should join the British government in lodging a strong protest with Tokyo. Le Parisien said that the unity of Britain and France is most evident in the Far East. The two governments should now be vigilant to deal with Japan. Several other newspapers said that Menorca and Hainan Island were occupied at the same time, which proves that the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo triangle is making sincere efforts to carry out its plan to oppose the democracies.

Editorial

### Japan's Intention in Attacking Hainan Island

Since occupying Guangzhou, the Japanese army has been clamoring for a large-scale attack on the southwest. However, on the land front, it has run into walls on three routes and has instead fallen into encirclement, unable to break through. Naval warships have been hovering in Tokyo Bay and entering and exiting the Qiongzhou Strait for a long time, without any action. But on the 10th of this month, they suddenly landed on Hainan Island, attempting to occupy the largest island along the Chinese coast.

Hainan Island has an area of 33,000 square kilometers, and the Wuzhi Mountain range covers the entire island. Only the coastal areas are relatively flat, with highways encircling the island. The Japanese army's target is Qiongshan in the north and Haikou Port outside Qiongshan. However, Haikou is covered with beaches, and ordinary merchant ships are not allowed to dock there. Therefore, the Japanese army landed at Qinglan Port in the east of the island and Lingao Port in the north of the island, and in two routes, they converged along the highway to attack Qiongshan and Haikou. Haikou and Haian in Leizhou Peninsula are only more than 20 kilometers apart. The Japanese army's occupation of the area is certainly a great threat to southern Guangdong. However, if the Japanese army wants to attack the southwest, it should concentrate its forces to capture Beihai in order to advance into Yongning and control the heart of the southwest. Why go so far and use Hainan Island, which is isolated in the South China Sea, as a base? Frankly speaking, since the fall of Guangzhou, Hainan Island has lost its importance in China's defense. The Japanese authorities know this. Therefore, their capture of Hainan Island is not a military strategy to attack southern China, but it has other important functions.

Originally, Hainan Island and French Vietnam are only separated by a narrow strip of water. If the Japanese army occupies the island, it will be a most serious oppression to France's Far Eastern colonies, making France's defense in Vietnam completely ineffective. At the same time, Hainan Island is also the hub of the South China Sea. From Hainan Island to British Singapore and American Philippines, a fan shape can be drawn, and this fan-shaped area encompasses all of the British, Dutch, and American South Sea Islands. The end of the fan handle is Hainan Island. Therefore, the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is simply aimed at becoming the leader of the South China Sea and is clearly challenging all countries in the world.

Currently in Europe, Italy is desperately pressing France, and the situation in Spain is deteriorating rapidly, putting France in a most serious predicament. Germany is also eager to try and settle centuries of old accounts with France. Japan is taking advantage of this opportunity to attack Hainan Island, as if saying that if a European war breaks out, Japan can cross this narrow strip of water and occupy Vietnam as easily as it occupied Qingdao 24 years ago. It can be said to be a most opportunistic bargain. If a European war does not break out for a while, Japan's control over the Far East has already been strengthened. Not only is Haiphong and Saigon placed within the reach of danger, but Singapore and Manila will also feel uneasy. This is naturally considered by Japan to be a deal with multiple benefits.

However, the Japanese warlords are dreaming beautiful dreams, but the beautiful dreams are ultimately difficult to come true. First, Hainan Island will not be easily occupied by the Japanese warlords. China's close contact with the Li ethnic group for thousands of years and the lessons of the ethnic struggle at the end of the Southern Song Dynasty have made the compatriots in Qiongyai the most heroic, most alert, most enduring, and most nationalistic members of the Chinese nation. As soon as the Japanese army lands on Hainan Island, a guerrilla war will immediately break out at the foot of the Wuzhi Mountains, digging a new grave for the Japanese navy in southern China. Just imagine, even if the Japanese army occupies Qiongshan, can it completely occupy all the coastal areas? Even if it occupies all the coastal areas, can it completely control the Wuzhi Mountain range? Therefore, this move by the Japanese army is no different from finding another place to consume troops, and it will soon realize that this is a foolish act of tying its own hands.

Second, because of the Hainan Island incident, the world's democracies will also have a deeper understanding of Japan and will rise up to take more practical sanctions. Britain and France have protested to Japan more than once because of the Far Eastern issue, but the facts have proved that protests on paper are of no use at all. The Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907 has also been torn up by Japan's move. Having learned many lessons, will they still act politely this time and engage in a paper war with Japan? Reports say that the Paris government plans not to protest the Hainan Island incident, which is actually an implication of taking actions beyond protest and is by no means a tacit approval of violence. In addition, Britain and the United States will probably have to unite and sanction this demon of the world. Therefore, the fall of the port of Barcelona in Spain will promote the unity of the democracies on their attitude towards Europe. The occupation of Hainan Island in China will also inevitably promote the unity and strengthening of British, French, and American actions in the Far East. We dare to predict that Japan's wishful thinking on Hainan Island will not succeed!

### British and French Interests Are All Threatened

(London) All newspapers here this morning published lengthy editorials about the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. The "Times" diplomatic correspondent pointed out that this occupation threatens the interests of both Britain and France. The transportation between Vietnam and Guangzhou Bay, in particular, is being controlled by the occupiers of Hainan Island. The correspondent mentioned that the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Butler, reported in the House of Commons last June that "The British and French governments have warned Japan that if it occupies Hainan Island, it will inevitably cause unpleasant disputes. If circumstances require, the British and French governments will assist each other to deal with such disputes." Therefore, London government officials are now carefully considering appropriate countermeasures for Japan's actions. (Eleventh day, Haitong News Agency)

(London) The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island has made the newspapers here uneasy. The "Times" reported that the Japanese government hopes that foreign countries will not misinterpret it. "Because Hainan Island is sufficient to control French Vietnam and the French concession of Guangzhou Bay, the British and French governments cannot but feel anxious." Thereupon, the "Times" also recounted the statement made by Foreign Office official Butler in the House of Commons on June 27th of last year, and inferred, "The British government is considering ways to respond to the impact on the interests of Britain and France and the Japanese government's previous promise of having no territorial ambitions." (Eleventh day, Havas News Agency)

### Testing the Degree of British-French Cooperation

(Washington) According to the United States government today, if Japan permanently occupies Hainan Island and establishes naval and air force bases on the island, it will completely change the strategic position of the Western Pacific. Therefore, the United States will be forced to strengthen its defense forces in the Pacific, of which Guam will be immediately armed. Because Hainan Island is only six hundred miles from the Philippine Islands, and is also adjacent to French Annam and British Hong Kong, it threatens the bases of the United States, Britain, and France in the Far East. (Tenth day, Associated Press)

(Washington) The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China was recently commented on by responsible American figures, who said that this is a political gesture to test whether the attitudes of Britain and France towards Far Eastern affairs are firm or weak. Japan is a signatory to the Anti-Comintern Pact. Its sending troops to land on Hainan Island is to test how strong British and French resistance is. In the United States, because the island belongs to Chinese territory, it is not planning to take any diplomatic action or make any other representations. (Tenth day, Havas News Agency)

(New York) The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China was recently commented on by the "New York Times," which said, "Since Japan began its military actions to conquer China, it has shown no greater contempt for the public opinion of Western democracies than in this attempt to occupy Hainan Island. This matter is of great significance to Britain, France, and the Netherlands. As for the United States, if it feels concerned about the Philippine Islands even for a single day, then it cannot ignore this action of Japan for even a single day. At this moment, Japan has already cut across the sea transportation line between British Singapore and Hong Kong Island. The seriousness of this nature and the breadth of the impact on many countries, although there are not many places in the world that have as great a relationship with Hainan Island as other vital locations. Furthermore, Japan's expansion policy is currently using Hainan Island as its southernmost point. Its meaning is far greater than the so-called 'military needs' and the so-called weakening of China. The conquest of Asia and the conquest of Europe are originally one problem, and another clear proof can be obtained here." (Tenth day, Havas News Agency)

(Manila) Today, the newspapers here prominently published the news of the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island and the death of the Pope. Government officials, according to the traditional practice, did not criticize this action of the Japanese army, because the status of the Philippine Republic is under the control of the United States. Well-informed sources believe that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, especially after the Japanese army invaded South China, the public's enthusiasm for Philippine independence has been greatly reduced. After the Japanese army occupies Hainan Island, it may extinguish this enthusiasm. The editorial of the "Philippine People's Voice" predicted that after the Japanese army occupies Hainan Island, it will make the policies of Britain, France, and the United States towards the Far East more clearly expressed. However, based on the current situation in Europe, Britain and France may not be able to make other representations other than strong protests. Therefore, the responsibility for this action should be borne by the United States. (Eleventh day, Associated Press)

### German Political Circles Express Satisfaction

(Berlin) After the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island in China, German political figures all expressed satisfaction. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had notified General Ott, the German ambassador to Japan, of the country's internal intentions. The "German General Report" recently commented that the Japanese army's action can make the tense relations between Japan and Western countries even more intensified. The "Evening News" said that the bases held by Britain, France, and the United States in the Haifu part of China have formed a triangular situation, namely Hong Kong, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Now, the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island has destroyed one of the strongholds within this triangular situation. It is expected that the French government will protest to Japan. (Tenth day, Havas News Agency)

(Berlin) After the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island in China, political figures here were very happy. They said that this decision was Japan's response to "a certain intimidation plan by Western democracies." Its significance in military strategy and diplomacy is both significant and sufficient to curb China's arms supply. (Eleventh day, Havas News Agency)

(Rome) The Italian side is paying close attention to the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island in China. The newspapers have commented on it, saying that this action has a decisive force for the future development of the Sino-Japanese War. The island has various advantages in military strategy. The Japanese army can rely on it to prevent ships from various countries from approaching the Chinese Sea, and make the two bases of British Hong Kong Island and the French concession of Guangzhou Bay lose their effectiveness. Before the Japanese army landed on the island, it had notified the governments of Italy and Germany of this intention in advance. (Eleventh day, Havas News Agency)

### The Japanese Army on the Nanxun Line Is Very Busy With Movements

Wanjiafu The Japanese army on the Nanxun front has been very busy with movements recently, so the front line is quite calm. It is said that more than 10,000 newly arrived Japanese troops from Jiujiang are transported by car to De'an Yongxiu every night. The Japanese army on the Ruiwu Road front has been continuously transporting supplies to Ruoxi and the north bank of the Xiu River with hundreds of transport vehicles. (Tenth day telegram)

Wanjiafu There are no battles on the Luohe front line. Only at 11 o'clock, the Japanese army northwest of Qiujin on the north bank fired more than 60 shells at the Tong'anling Lion Mountain area of the Chinese army. The shells fell on the wilderness, and the Chinese army suffered no losses. (Eleventh day telegram)

### The Pope's Remains Moved to the Sistine Chapel The Public Flocked to Pay Their Respects The Italian King Issued an Edict for National Mourning for Eight Days

(Rome) The Italian King issued an edict for mourning the Pope for eight days. Groups of people went to the altars of various churches to light candles and pray, non-stop throughout the day. All theaters and cinemas were closed tonight to express mourning. At 4 p.m., 5,000 people lined up in St. Peter's Square to await the public display of the Pope's remains. The Vatican authorities originally intended to only allow those with special privileges to enter the Sistine Chapel, but because more and more people gathered, they decided to open the doors of the chapel to accommodate all walks of life. Believers were allowed to enter and kneel and pass by. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was also among those who paid their respects. Ciano represented the Fascist government and knelt beside the Pope's remains with Cardinal Basili, the Secretary of State of the Holy See, to recite prayers. The Pope was rich in knowledge, governed with sincerity, and had a fearless spirit, emphasizing humanitarianism. Therefore, the Roman political circles were also deeply saddened by the news of his death. The Italian King and Mussolini originally planned to attend the 10th anniversary celebration of the establishment of the political and religious harmony agreement at St. Peter's Basilica next Sunday.

Vatican City Pope Pius XI died this morning due to a recurrence of his old illness. All newspapers here issued extra editions. The "Roman Observer" published a communiqué stating, "After the Pope's old symptoms recurred twice yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m. and 4:15 p.m., his condition worsened at 4 a.m. this morning, and he passed away at 5:31 a.m." After receiving the news, Prime Minister Mussolini immediately ordered all agencies to fly flags at half-mast. The Italian court decided to mourn for eight days. Thousands of Catholics in St. Peter's Church couldn't help but shed tears and kneel to pray after suddenly hearing the funeral bells. This afternoon, the Pope's remains have been moved to the Vatican Sistine Chapel. Italian nobles, the diplomatic corps, and Vatican officials were able to pay their respects. The Pope's remains will be moved to St. Peter's Church tomorrow, where the public will line up to pay their respects. Everything in the Holy See is temporarily under the responsibility of Cardinal Bazeli, the Secretary of State of the Holy See, while waiting for the papal election to elect a successor.

After the establishment of the Rome-Berlin Axis, the Pope did not hesitate to join forces with the democracies and constantly made provocative moves.

In addition to theology and philosophy, he was also familiar with the science of the times. He was in charge of the world's church affairs, and his deployment was well-organized, regardless of the magnitude. He spared no effort in promoting canine Catholicism, which is unforgettable. However, Pius X did not have a deep understanding of the current political system movement, so it was inevitable that he would have disagreements with Germany and Italy. It is said that from the 12th to the 14th, from noon to 1 p.m. every day, the Catholic churches in Berlin will strike bells to express mourning. (Eleventh day, Haitong News Agency)

### Brazil Welcomes American Immigrants Hoping for American Commercial Loans to Resist German Economic Aggression

(Washington) After Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha arrived here, he met with Deputy Secretary of State Welles this morning to discuss general relations between the two sides. The meeting lasted for two hours. According to well-informed sources, Foreign Minister Aranha proposed that the United States government help unemployed workers immigrate to Brazil to engage in agriculture and mining. He said that this plan can not only relieve unemployment, but also revitalize Brazilian industries. It can be said to be a win-win situation. Brazil is rich in iron ore, coal, and oil. Once developed, it can greatly benefit American industries and American immigrants in Brazil. In addition, after a large number of American unemployed workers immigrate to Brazil, Brazil's demand for American goods will also increase accordingly. This can be said to be all good for the United States. In addition, Foreign Minister Aranha also met with Deputy Secretary of State Welles and said, "Germany is using generous lending policies to carry out economic aggression in Brazil. I hope that the United States will broaden its horizons and adopt wise commercial lending policies as a countermeasure, and not be stingy about Brazil's bad debts." (Tenth day, Hahustus News Agency)

### Japanese Economic Experts Arrive in Cuba for Investigation

Capital of Cuba Five Japanese economic experts came to Latin America for investigation and have arrived at the "Azerat Truffer" Club in this city. They recently published a document in the newspapers, expressing their opposition. It is inappropriate for government officials to have met with these experts. The government should now investigate the number of Japanese expatriates. During the investigation, Japanese expatriates are not allowed to leave their place of residence unless they have written permission from local officials. In addition, Japanese fishermen should also be prohibited from fishing in Cuban territorial waters, and those who already live in various strategic locations should be ordered to relocate.

### Irish Party Members Carry Out Terrorist Activities Causing Anxiety in London

(London) Many terrorist incidents occurred again last night, causing anxiety among the people across the country. Near the electrical plant in Portsmouth, someone threw a simple bomb last night, which exploded but did no damage. A fire broke out in a winter camp near the city of Skegness. Residents of the city heard three explosions in a row at night, all coming from the winter camp. When the police rushed to investigate after hearing the sound, the fire had indeed started. The police authorities believe that this was done by terrorists. In addition, rumors spread in London this morning that terrorists were about to blow up London Bridge (on the River Thames). After investigation by the police, two suspects have been arrested. London Bridge and Southwark Bridge are heavily guarded by the military police to prevent accidents.

### Five Hundred Thousand Young Men and Women Serving the Country in the Rear: Xishan Enthusiastically Engaged in Propaganda and Relief Work, Striving for National Liberation Through Hard Work

Chongqing Correspondence: In the nineteen months since the July 7th Incident, the victory in national salvation work is what Chinese youth have felt most honored about. This has not only gained the sympathy of people across the country, but also the praise of people all over the world. Since the beginning of China's full-scale war of resistance, Chinese youth have indeed done a lot of practical national salvation work. These more than 500,000 young men and women scattered in various inland areas, from any point of view, their spirit is enough to express their enthusiasm for the country.

In fact, under this all-out war of resistance, every young person has felt the importance of their own responsibility. Stirred by their passionate emotions, they could no longer bear to sit still in the classroom. So they left school. A part of the youth bravely rushed to the front lines. They joined formal armies, or formed small guerrilla units to engage in direct resistance against the enemy. The best example is the young university students in Tianjin and Beiping. Most of the young men and women, although they did not stand on the front lines to fight, they are very busy serving in the rear.

In many areas such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Changsha, and Xi'an, many political propaganda work, relief work for wounded soldiers, and refugee resettlement work are now entirely undertaken by young people. What is most admirable is the youth from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. They used to live a very comfortable metropolitan life in Shanghai, but today they are serving in the inland areas. They not only do not feel uncomfortable with the life, but their spirit of service is even better than others.

What we should mention is the efforts of young women in participating in the war of resistance. In many hospitals in the inland areas, female students are serving as nurses to wounded soldiers. The best phenomenon is that they treat the wounded soldiers as their own brothers. They talk to them, comfort them, write letters home, sing, and read war news. They have a slogan that says, "Reducing the suffering of wounded soldiers and restoring their health is our first responsibility!"

(Situation of the departure of the Women's Relief Team)

Many young women are also receiving military training. They put on military uniforms, cut their hair short, and at sunrise, they are already drilling in the square with guns on their backs.

In every university or middle school in Chongqing, there are at least eight hours of military subjects per week. Their daily lives are all militarized. Attending classes, eating, getting up, and exercising are all lived under the same discipline. In the suburbs, there are often teams of young student soldiers conducting field exercises. Agile and accurate movements symbolize that everyone is a brave future.

In terms of propaganda work, they are expanding their efforts. At the same time, many school professors are also helping to participate. Their highest goal is to improve the knowledge of the general public in order to strengthen and consolidate the patriotic sentiments of the people. They have decided on four guidelines to promote this work: Teach illiterate masses to write and read. Enlighten the masses' thoughts on national salvation. Train farmers to improve farming and handicraft production. Train the people on how to organize themselves to resist aggression. Under this plan, many young people are engaged in various different ways to achieve this goal. They run in teams and districts to various villages and cities, organizing drama and singing troupes, performing dramas of national salvation everywhere, and teaching the public to sing songs of national salvation. Mr. Liu Liangmo, a composer of mass songs, led many young men and women to work in various parts of Changsha. These means of realistic propaganda containing high awareness awakened the will of the masses to resist the war.

Many university students in Chengdu organized rural service groups, using their holidays to work in nearby rural areas. They established temporary schools and public night schools, gathering nearby farmers to study, establishing mobile libraries, and traveling to give lectures, telling wartime knowledge such as air defense, poison gas prevention, and first aid. In the summer of last year, students from various universities in Chongqing, including Fudan University and Central University, successively organized economic investigation groups in various provinces (some also joined economic investigation groups organized by the authorities) to investigate Guiyang and southwestern provinces, and achieved considerable results.

At the Northwest Anti-Japanese War University, many young men and women are training in difficult lives. The graduates of each session are assigned to lead important anti-Japanese war work in various places, totaling five or six thousand people.

Secondly, in Chongqing, under the leadership of Ms. Soong Mei-ling, hundreds of young women are also being trained, and they will also undertake special rear service work.

In summary: In the past year or so, Chinese youth have been tense and successful in their work of resisting the war and saving the country. Every young person serving in the inland areas is not only enthusiastic, but also actually working hard. There is no individual among them, but they care for the group with each other. In the arduous struggle, they hope to open up a new path and seek true national liberation!

### Promoting Rear Area Construction: Guiyang Today (Continued)

In terms of publishing, there are more than ten regular publications, including the Provincial Government Gazette, New Daxia Monthly, Anti-Japanese Weekly, and National Construction Review. Magazines from Chongqing can also be seen quickly after three days. As for newspapers, there were originally two types: Guizhou Morning Post and Revolutionary Daily, printed by lithography. After the fall of Wuhan, Wuhan Daily was renamed Guiyang Central Daily and moved to Chu for publication. The Provincial Library is the only complete mental food library here, with a collection of about 50,000 books, more than 200 types of magazines, and more than 40 types of newspapers. However, there are so many restaurants and hotels in Guiyang City, but there is only one mental restaurant. How can it satisfy so many readers with strong appetites? Therefore, the appeal to the education authorities to fill the library and add more reading rooms can often be seen in newspapers. In addition, there is a provincial public education center, where there are also daily newspapers and magazines. Educational, air defense, and anti-virus films are also shown in the square every night, which has a great effect on instilling knowledge in the public. The drama movement is very vigorous in Guiyang. There are eight or nine amateur theater groups such as Wolf Fire, Sand Camel, and Daxia. Most of them are school students. On average, there is always one theater group performing every month. Bookstores such as Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, Zhengzhong Bookstore, Beixin Bookstore, and Life Bookstore all have branches. The prices of books here do not increase, only adding 2% for shipping. Since the end of last year, the provincial government established a radio station, which broadcasts from 6 pm every day.

Transportation situation: There are health test institutes. In addition to the Provincial Hospital, the Nanjing Central Hospital has also recently moved here. The equipment and medicines are more complete, which is very convenient for patients. There are buses in the city, but they have closed down due to poor business. Therefore, there are only rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages. Guiyang is also the center of the Sichuan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Guizhou, Guangxi-Guizhou, and Hunan-Guizhou highways. The Southwest Highway Transportation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation is located here. The station is outside Zhongshanmen. Each of the four roads has a bus once a day. The price to Haitang on the opposite bank of Chongqing is 20.50 yuan, to Kunming is 29.15 yuan, to Liuzhou is 27.80 yuan, and to Changsha is 44.40 yuan. Nowadays, passengers to Chongqing and Kunming are too crowded, and you must register in order to purchase tickets. This waiting list has already reached March of this year. There is also a section bus on the Guiyang (Guiyang to Dingyang to Bijie) highway, which is specially opened by the Highway Bureau of the Construction Department. In addition to highway buses, the transport of mules and horses is also an important means of transportation. Dozens of horses transport pots, wood, bricks, and things needed by Guiyang from other counties. When they go back, they carry salt, sugar, matches, and other daily necessities used by other counties. The people who drive the horses live in the wild all year round. Their great endurance and perseverance are really admirable. Recently, China Airlines has resumed flights between Yu and Chu, flying back and forth three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which makes the distance between Xi Qing and Guiyang shorter. There are also 300 telephones in the city. The China Travel Service has achieved great results in serving the Southwest. In addition to cooperating with the Southwest Highway Bureau to operate dining and accommodation stations on the Southwest Highway, the provincial government has entrusted it to run a guest house here. The nature of the guest house is similar to that of a hotel. The furnishings are clean and simple. There is table tennis and the ball skills. The members of the Central Committee and senators who pass through Chu stay in the guest house. There are two cinemas in the city. The Qianyang Grand Stage is a Sichuan opera and Ping opera theater with Yu Chu.

Social dynamics: Coal is the most abundant product. It can be found along the highway, so the aborigines use their own soil method to refine coal. The output of iron and wood is very considerable. White fungus is very cheap, and the locals do not regard it as a treasure. When a newcomer to Guiyang enters the suburbs, he can see many eye-catching slogans with artistic fonts. The National Art College painted a lot of huge oil paintings and comics on the streets. The Children's Theater Troupe of the Political Department, with more than 60 children, traveled more than 10,000 miles. This time, they spent the New Year in Guiyang. Although it was only a few days, their efforts left an indelible impression. The second phase of the Guiyang Youth Spring Men and Women's Battlefield Work Service Group has departed for the front line. The winter vacation is approaching, and the students are organizing rural propaganda teams, preparing to go deep into every corner. The cold clothing donation pushed from Guiyang has just remitted 200,000, while the one-yuan debt repayment campaign in response to Shanghai is also unfolding rapidly. Charity sales are even more rampant in the city. At least one day of charity sales is held in each industry. Guiyang doctors recorded a glorious day in the medical industry with their charity donations. These are all comprehensive results of everyone's patriotic enthusiasm and the intentional support of this patriotic enthusiasm. In these places, Guiyang seems too young. Usually everyone is working seriously. On the street, you can see a firm smile on the face of every pedestrian.

### Yarn and Cloth from Dasheng Textile Mill Detained by Japanese Troops

Nantong Correspondence: Since the fall of Nantong and Haimen, the Japanese special service agencies and local puppet organizations have coveted the industry in Jiangbei, especially the Dasheng Textile Mill, which is the first to bear the brunt. They do not hesitate to collude with each other, secretly plotting to destroy it. This has been going on for several months. On the surface, they still want to maintain the facade of friendship and dare not openly invade. In fact, they have been destroying it in every possible way recently. A few days ago, a large batch of more than 500 pieces of cloth from the Dasheng No. 3 Mill in Haimen were shipped to Shanghai. After import, they were suddenly detained by the Japanese special service agency without asking any questions. It is said that a large amount of goods from the Dasheng No. 1 Mill were also detained. I am afraid that if the Japanese army does not leave, it will be difficult to maintain the industry in Jiangbei.

### The Western Government Regroups and Decides to Continue the War: Government Agencies Move Back to Madrid; Miaja Appointed Commander-in-Chief

Madrid: Spanish Prime Minister Negrín has announced that Madrid is the seat of the Spanish Republican government. (Reuters, 10th)

Bilbao: The Western Republican government announced today that the government army is determined to continue the war and defend the territory of the central and southern parts of Spain. Its headquarters will be located in Madrid. According to the superiority of that place in resisting the rebels, it has been almost three years. The Republican government issued this announcement in the official gazette, signed jointly by Prime Minister Negrín and the newly appointed commander-in-chief of the government armies, General Miaja. After Dr. Negrín arrived in Valencia by plane, he immediately ordered reinforcements to the government army, including women working on the front lines. General Miaja's subordinates include a total of 250,000 people, the most elite unit since the beginning of the Western War. It is expected that this decision will start a more intense war of resistance. (Associated Press, 10th)

Madrid: Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín reiterated today his determination to continue the war until the conditions he put forward in Congress on February 1 are fulfilled, and announced that Madrid will once again be the seat of the government. The conditions put forward by Mr. Nai are as follows: Guarantee the independence of Spain; Allow the Spanish people to decide their own political system; There shall be no retaliatory actions after the end of the war. (Reuters, 11th)

Madrid: The various departments under the Republican government have moved to the cities of Valencia and Barcelona one after another, and it has been 27 months since then. Now they have returned here, the officials are very gratified, and the general residents are not afraid that the National Army will once again use this city as an attack target. General Miaja, the commander of the Central Route, has been ordered to stay since 1936. Although the National Army has repeatedly launched attacks, it has not succeeded. General Te's prestige has been greatly shaken and he has now been promoted to commander-in-chief of the Republican Army. The people all deeply believe in him. (Havas, 11th)

Toulouse: It is said that Western Government Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Valyut have both gone to the Madrid area in order to discuss with the commanders-in-chief of the navy, army, and air force, Miaja's economic system. However, in order to conduct these negotiations, a formal ambassador must be stationed in the National Army government's location. This is because the Central Kingdom must recognize the National Government as the legitimate government of the Western Kingdom as soon as possible. (Havas, 11th)

(Paris) Regarding France's appointment of an ambassador to the Spanish National Army government, Prime Minister Daladier had repeatedly communicated with social party leader and former cabinet prime minister Blum yesterday, and their opinions gradually converged. This news surprised the people in the House of Representatives, but Mr. Da's personal opinion was difficult to clear, and the party's position was solid and had no impact. The Socialist Party immediately passed a resolution resolutely opposing the government's dispatch of an ambassador to Burgos or recognizing the National Army government, and jointly issued a statement with the "French-Western Friendship Group" in the House of Representatives, publicly expressing support for Negrín to continue the war. (Haitong, 11th)

(Berlin) The evolving relationship between the United Kingdom, France, and the Spanish National Army is still of concern to Germany, which can be seen in the arguments of various newspapers. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" warned National Army Commander General Franco that the "strategies of the United Kingdom and France" had the following words: "The British and French authorities have expressed their friendship and offered their goodwill to General Franco, and the "Italian News" reporter stationed in London said that London and Paris hope that the National Army can accept economic assistance from the United Kingdom and France. Regarding the occupation of the Zhujia Islands, they sang the words of avoiding bloodshed again, which is also hypocrisy." "Jiang Huai Bao" reported that France attempted to win over Burgos and make the Spanish National Army a vassal of France. Although this attempt can never come true, the general public believes that the power of money is great and that it cannot be prevented. "Fascist Gongbao" reported that the British government's policy hopes to end the Western Civil War as soon as possible and use diplomatic means to unite with the victor, which is now obvious. (Haitong, 11th)

### All of Catalonia is Under the Control of the National Army

Barcelona: The National Army launched an offensive in the Catalonia Autonomous Region with a force of 350,000, which lasted for 50 days. Now it has completely occupied the region. Looking back at the course of the war, before the National Army arrived at the city of Bagas, Burenjas, the progress was slow due to the difficulty in the progress of the Italian troops. Until the siege of Barcelona, the government troops gradually retreated. The National Army took advantage of the momentum to occupy all the land in the Catalonia Autonomous Region. As a result, the government army's sea routes are only

### Semi-Official Organ of Italy Reaffirms Territorial Demands: Says It Will Not Hesitate to Fight If It Does Not Get Satisfaction

(London) According to the diplomatic circles here today, due to the obstruction of the death of Pope Pius, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may postpone his territorial demands on France. It is said that while the Pope was dying, he still whispered prayers for world peace, so it does not seem to be an opportunity for the Italian Prime Minister to wield his sword at this time. It is generally believed that before the selection of a successor to the Pope is determined, Mussolini will find it difficult to make the general public interested in territorial demands. It is generally believed that the Pope has been working for peace until his death, and has also made contributions to European peace. The death of the Pope has not without causing the diplomatic offensive of Germany and Italy to fall into difficulties. (Associated Press, 10th)

(Rome) The semi-official organ "International Relations Consolidation Magazine" published an article today reaffirming various territorial demands, saying that France must cede Tunisia, the Suez Canal, Djibouti Port, Corsica, and Nice Port to Italy, otherwise Italy is prepared to go to war, and in order to monitor France's policy, Italian volunteers in Spain should not be ordered to withdraw. The full text reads: Italy and Germany's various demands are based on international justice, so no threats to various civil governments can contain these demands. "Italy's actions in Spain will enable the overall situation in Europe to be preserved. Italian volunteers will never be withdrawn until the National Army has won a solid victory. In other words, Italian volunteers must wait until France's policy is fully understood by us before withdrawing. France has stated that preventing other countries from interfering in Spain's internal affairs is a matter of vital interest to France. This is the case for France, and why not for Italy? Therefore, it is urgent for Italian volunteers to stay in Spain to monitor the development of France's policy. In short, if France insists on rejecting Italy's various natural desires, the result will not only be harmful to France, but also to the overall situation in Europe. Because if Italy's desires cannot be satisfied through negotiations, it can only be resolved by force. Which of the two to choose? The French government and people must have something to choose from." (Omitted below) (Havas, 11th)

### 35,000 Tons: German New Battleship, Three Completed, One to Be Launched

(Berlin) Germany's largest battleship of 35,000 tons built after the war, now known as F, is scheduled to be launched on February 14. The ceremony will be very grand. Government officials and party leaders will participate. It is generally believed that Hitler will personally attend the ceremony and deliver a speech. The name of this ship has not yet been announced. It may be named after a German celebrity such as Huenmai or Hindenburg, but it may also be named after a place to commemorate Germany's victory last year. The shipyard building this ship is now preparing to be greatly decorated to celebrate its success. German newspapers have now published articles pointing out that this ship will be the first to fully realize Germany's maritime power. Germany will occupy a position among the great maritime powers from now on. It is expected that the speed of this new ship can be used by France and Italy, which cannot be compared with the same battleships left over from the past. This is because all the improvements gained from years of research and experience are placed in this ship. According to Germany's large battleships, there are three Fs as the first. The other two are one G, which can be tested in the summer, and one H. (Reuters, 11th)

### The United Kingdom Is Determined to Make Every Effort to Maintain World Peace: International Disputes Should Be Resolved Through Negotiations; British Naval Power Is Sufficient to Maintain Traffic Safety

Plymouth: Home Secretary Hoare delivered a speech at the banquet of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce here tonight, saying, "If the issue of raw material supply becomes the cause of future international disputes, then we have no reason at this time to refuse to resolve this issue, and even all commercial issues, through negotiations." The suggestions I made to the League of Nations in 1935 when I was the Foreign Secretary are still valid today, and I hope that people of insight from all countries will respond. As far as British foreign policy is concerned, we are determined to do everything possible to maintain peace, but the various interests that are vital to survival, as well as the friendship we have with our friendly countries, must also be maintained. Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent statement on the relationship between the United Kingdom and France is a clear proof of this. The integrity of the British Empire must be defended. "If the Empire is unfortunately weakened or even disintegrated one day, then the main hope of maintaining international peace will disappear within the next few hundred years." At this point, Home Secretary Hoare praised the strength of the British Navy and the expansion of naval armaments, saying, "According to past war experience and the major technological advances gained since the European War, we believe that the United Kingdom will no longer be threatened by submarines at sea." The United Kingdom and the United States both aim to maintain peace. The strong naval power of the United States is a matter of great comfort. The strength of our fleet "is also sufficient to carry out its main responsibilities. In other words, the British Navy can fully protect the overseas traffic lines of the British Empire."

### Yellow River Expert Expresses Opinion

(Chongqing) Famous Yellow River expert Cao Shumin (transliteration) wrote an article published in this morning's Shishi Xinbao, saying that the Central Government must immediately block the breaches in the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou and Zhaokou (transliteration), and guide the flood through Haizhou to the sea at Linhongkou (transliteration). Mr. Cao agreed with Su Shen Han Guojun's call for the government to find a way to deal with the Yellow River flood to save the 10 million people in northern Jiangsu. Mr. Cao also said that after the Yellow River flood flows into the Huai River, the nine counties in northern Jiangsu are now in danger of being completely flooded. He suggested that water should be diverted northward from Hongze Lake and into the Lutang River (transliteration), and then follow the Mu River (transliteration) through Haizhou and Linhongkou into the sea. In addition to the Yellow River issue, for military reasons, the government must also save the nine counties in northern Jiangsu, because the Chinese side can use the area as a base for a future counterattack to the Shanghai area.

### England and France to Unconditionally Recognize Franco's Government; Germany and Italy Watch Future Situation, Mocking England and France's Hopes to Profit from Opportunity

(London) Regarding the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government, according to observations from well-informed sources in political circles here, the governments of England and France may soon unconditionally recognize it as the legitimate government. It is also said that the British Cabinet on the 14th of this month, and the French Cabinet the following day, will make separate decisions on this matter. It is believed that if England and France were to prepare for recognition while simultaneously proposing conditions for exchange, it would be of no benefit. There are three reasons for this: 1. If the Nationalist authorities refuse to accept these conditions, the position of England and France will be diminished as a result. 2. If the Republican government feels encouraged by this and continues the war, the impact will not be enough to salvage their failure and will only increase their losses. 3. At this juncture, only expressing goodwill towards General Franco, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist forces, can promote the country's independence and neutrality. Apart from these three points, future negotiations between Britain and the Spanish Nationalist authorities on financial aid, the withdrawal of Italian volunteer soldiers, and the possibility of the Spanish Nationalist government joining the Anti-Comintern Pact will all become topics of discussion. British political figures also declare that when the Nationalist forces initiated their uprising in July 1936, they originally "aimed to eradicate communism within Spain. It would not be easy to prevent them from joining the Anti-Comintern Pact at this point. However, in reality, the signatory countries of this pact retain the right to act independently, so joining or not joining does not have much significance." As for the issue of financial aid, Britain should do its utmost to dissuade the Nationalist authorities from adopting fascist principles to establish an economic system. In essence, Britain's financial assistance to the Nationalist government hinges on whether General Franco maintains liberalism, which would prove that the interference of various countries in Spanish internal affairs has already changed its direction. Since General Franco's recovery of Catalonia, England and France have suddenly shown him favor. This is a significant success outside of military matters for General Franco and he can certainly be proud of it, but he must carefully examine the motives of these countries, which are no different from their previous support for the government forces. In other words, they are simply hoping to profit from the opportunity. This should also be well understood by General Franco. As for the sake of Spain's national interests, having received the assistance of Germany and Italy during times of hardship, he should know how to repay those countries. In the future, joining the Anti-Comintern Pact would be the right course of action. The "Public Observation News" also states that England and France's interference in Spanish affairs is increasing day by day, resulting in expressions of dissatisfaction. The British authorities aim for the Spanish Nationalist government to declare neutrality. "Britain has interfered in Spanish internal affairs for hundreds of years and intends to continue this policy. The fact that Gibraltar belongs to Britain is a symbol of this policy." (Havas dispatch of the 11th)

(Rome) The Italian public expresses suspicion regarding the Western democracies' change in attitude towards the Spanish Nationalist forces. Most people believe that this move is purely aimed at the ports of Valencia and Cartagena in the Western countries, as these ports are frequently bombed by Nationalist aircraft, making it very difficult for the government forces to obtain supplies from abroad.

### American Ambassador to England Leaves America to Return to Post; Denies Predicting European War

(New York) U.S. Ambassador to England, Kennedy, stated before boarding the "Queen Mary" today that he had met with President Roosevelt for two hours yesterday. However, I do not acknowledge the prediction made during a closed-door meeting of the Military Committee on January 10 with the U.S. Ambassador to France, Mr. Bullet, that a war would occur in Europe next quarter. His words said, "I have never predicted a war. I told you all when I arrived in the country that I am good at predicting the stock market and diplomatic affairs, but I am not a prophet, so I cannot predict a war." When asked if his return to England had any connection to the situation in Spain, Kennedy replied, "I am simply returning to my post to work." (Reuters dispatch of the 10th)

### American Nationals in Chongqing Urge Government to Stop Shipment of War Goods to Japan; U.S. Publishes Statistics on Arms Exports, Scrap Metal Shipments to Japan Have Not Yet Ceased

(Hong Kong) All American Nationals in Chongqing telegraphed Roosevelt, Hull, and members of Congress on the 11th, reporting on the atrocities of Japanese aircraft bombing Wanxian and Guiyang, and in the name of humanity and world peace, urged a halt to the shipment of oil, iron, and other materials to Japan. (Special dispatch of the 11th, 11:00 PM)

(Chongqing) Two cargo ships previously planned to load 1,200 tons of scrap iron in Long Beach Port, California, for Japan. However, dockworkers refused to load the scrap iron onto the ships, and thousands of workers set up a cordon at the docks. The Chinese National Foreign Affairs Association recently sent a telegram expressing gratitude and hoped that they would continue their efforts, uniting with dockworker comrades across America to magnify this movement. (Telegram of the 11th)

Of this, all shipments to England were military aircraft, totaling $447,147. Shipments to France included both aircraft and munitions, totaling $969,366. Shipments to Japan included 2,396 tons of tinplate, totaling $43,574. (Havas dispatch of the 10th)

### Large Outflow of European Gold to America

(New York) Recently, another large batch of gold from Europe has arrived in the United States. The latest batch, worth $60,000,000, has already been deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank. The bank's foreign gold reserves have exceeded $600,000,000. Most of it was shipped from England. While the stated reason is to stabilize exchange rates, such a large sum is not really necessary, and the intention is likely something else. According to Wall Street financial circles, European countries may want to store gold in the United States as reserves, so that in the event of war, they can use cash to purchase military supplies and raw materials according to the principle of assuming responsibility for transportation. The risk of transporting gold at that time would thus be avoided. (Havas dispatch of the 10th)

### Arab Representatives Present Four Demands: Abolish Mandate System, Recognize Independence, Immediately Stop Jewish Immigration to Palestine

(London) When the British and Jewish representatives of the Palestine Conference met today, British Colonial Secretary MacDonald explained his views on various cases presented by the Jewish Agency. The Jewish delegation agreed to carefully consider the points made today and provide a response on Monday. The Arabs have already released a statement on yesterday's meeting, saying that their demands are based on the natural right of a people to reside in their country, and to safeguard the existence of their nation, and the natural desire to establish and develop their national existence in harmony and freedom without contradicting their customs and thoughts. It is not comparable to anti-Semitism and has nothing to do with hostility towards the English or other people. In October 1915, the British government made a promise to allow the Arabs to be independent. Repeated assurances have since been made to acknowledge the same promises, in order to repay the Arabs for their assistance in the Allied victory. Promises without substance. The Arabs have not gained independence. As for the Balfour Declaration or the British Mandate, the Arabs have never recognized it, nor do they intend to recognize it. The problem of finding a place to reside for displaced Jews is a matter for the entire civilized world, but the solution must not be in Palestine. What the Arabs are demanding now is: 1. Complete independence. 2. Abolition of the attempt to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. 3. Abolition of the mandate and its replacement with a treaty making Palestine a sovereign Arab state. 4. Immediate cessation of Jewish immigration and the purchase of land by Jews. The policies implemented in Palestine are unprecedentedly unfair to the Arabs. Unless this injustice is thoroughly rectified in accordance with recognized moral and egalitarian principles, there will be no peace in this holy land. The Arabs believe that the plans implemented under the mandate, such as facilitating Jewish immigration and land purchases, and other preferential treatment, have rendered the mandate ineffective and should be abolished. The Arabs are prepared to negotiate in a moderate spirit the conditions for safeguarding reasonable British interests, and accept the necessary guarantees to preserve the rights of access to the holy sites and to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Jews and other minorities within Palestine. The Arabs' objections to the aforementioned policies can be summarized in the following three points: 1. The independence repeatedly promised during the European war has not been implemented. 2. Allowing large numbers of Jews with completely different languages, customs, morals, and concepts to enter the country, regardless of their impact on the Arab social customs and moral standards. 3. Implementing arbitrary legislation under the pressure of the Zionist organization to facilitate the purchase of land by Jews, without sufficient measures to protect farmers from dispossession and eviction. The speech by the Chairman of the Jewish Agency, Mr. Liesman, was originally scheduled to be released today, but it is now heard that it has been changed to Monday. (Reuters dispatch of the 10th)

### German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact to Expand into Military Alliance; Japanese Authorities Say Under Consideration

### Puppet "Central China Government" Controls Imports; Yangtze River Goods Import Tax; Tax Collection Offices Established in Hupukou and Other Places; Starting Next Week, the Japanese Side Will Strictly Enforce

Starting next week, the Japanese side will control all trade goods transported to the Yangtze River Delta area (crossroad estuary). It has guaranteed to the puppet "Central China Government" to manage the so-called "floating goods import tax," which the Japanese side will enforce in the occupied areas. According to the report notifying Chinese merchants, all trade goods transported to the Yangtze River estuary area, except for goods transported to Japanese warships for military use, will be subject to import taxes. This new tax collection office has also been established by the puppet "Central China Government" in Hupukou, downstream of the Yangtze River. Other important ports in Jiangsu, such as Wuxi, Suzhou, and Changshu, have also established branch offices to handle the tax collection for ships transporting goods. It is claimed that the purpose of this measure is to regulate the large quantities of goods transported inland by waterways and points out the importance of Hupukou's commercial position. Personnel from the new tax collection office of the puppet "Central China Government" in Hupukou embezzled more than 20,000 yuan of public funds last month and fled, leading the Japanese side to take responsibility for handling import goods tax collection starting next week. As for the export goods tax in the Yangtze River area, it has been enforced by the puppet "Central China Government" since October of last year.

### British Community Decides to Establish the "British Relief for China Fund"

Since the Mayor of London initiated the organization of the China Relief Fund Committee, British people have enthusiastically donated and contributed a significant amount of medicines for Chinese refugees. The committee previously received a report from Mr. Williamson, Chairman of the Shandong Relief Committee, stating that due to the Chinese war, there are currently over ten million refugees in dire need of assistance. The committee immediately telegraphed the British Relief Committee in China for a detailed investigation to determine a relief plan, and held a joint relief conference in Shanghai on January 29th, which concluded on the 31st. According to sources, the joint conference resolved to establish the "British Relief for China Fund Chinese Headquarters" in Kunming, with Mr. Davidson, the British Consul-General in Kunming, as Chairman. A branch will also be established in Chongqing to be responsible for planning relief matters. All other decisions regarding relief work have been made. All necessary expenses and relief funds will be the responsibility of the London headquarters, which will remit them to Yunnan and Chongqing on a regular basis. The first meeting in Yunnan is scheduled for the end of February. At the joint conference, representatives from various regions provided detailed reports on the refugee situation. For example, a flood in northern Jiangsu Province has left refugees displaced and homeless, and local priests are trying to provide relief. Throughout China, there are continuous large-scale bombings, causing many civilian casualties in urban areas. The situation is extremely tragic, and the number of refugees is increasing daily, requiring urgent relief efforts. The headquarters originally intended to be established in Shanghai, but for the convenience of work, it was decided to relocate to Kunming.

### Spurious Legal Tender Discovered; Inferior Paper Makes It Easily Identifiable

Following the Ministry of Finance's regulations on suppressing Japanese and puppet banknotes, banking circles reported yesterday that while some spurious legal tender has been discovered in the market, the amount is very small.

A certain bank discovered someone attempting to exchange spurious legal tender at the bank and detected it. Because the person holding the spurious note proved to be a legitimate merchant, the bank only stamped the counterfeit note with a "fake note" chop to invalidate it, without pursuing the matter further.

### Public Concession Searches for Thugs; 144 Arrested; Police Force Proven Effective

The "Continental Daily News" reports that intelligence obtained last night (the 10th) reveals that detectives from the Public Concession Police Department have intensified their efforts to investigate armed crime. In the first nine days of this month, they have arrested no fewer than 144 Chinese individuals associated with armed thugs and seized 19 handguns. This operation is being conducted through the cooperation of detectives from the nine police stations. Detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station are shouldering the majority of the responsibility, having arrested no fewer than 43 armed bandits in their district since the beginning of this month. The Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested 41 individuals, and the Hongkou West District Police Station arrested 21. The Criminal Division of the Central Police Station arrested 17, and the Lao Zha Police Station arrested an average of one thug per day. The Putu Road Police Station arrested five thugs, and the Yangshupu Police Station, north of the Suzhou Creek, also participated in the crackdown, arresting three individuals. Detectives from the Xinzha Police Station also apprehended three individuals, and the Yulin Road Police Station arrested two. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the police force. In light of recent criticisms in Japanese newspapers regarding the Police Department, denouncing it as poorly organized, this record is of great significance.

### Japanese Troops in Xinchang Town, Pudong, Suffer Losses and Retreat; Japanese Troops Busily Redeployed and Exhausted; Chinese Troops Seize the Opportunity to Advance and Directly Threaten Zhoupu

In Shangnan and Shangchuan, Pudong, the Japanese military's stronghold lines are in a precarious situation. In the past five days, due to the activities of guerrillas taking advantage of the situation, the Japanese have been fully exposed to the suffering of running back and forth and being exhausted, making it difficult to cope. In Shangchuan, the Japanese military's Zhihong unit has been largely emptied, and the Chinese army has

grasped its weaknesses, launching assaults on various military stations along the Shangchuan Road for several nights in a row, inflicting heavy casualties. The Japanese army, with only a hundred or so experienced soldiers, was unable to hold out and urgently requested reinforcements from the Ogawa unit in Shangnan. On the morning of the 9th, they sent over 200 soldiers to reinforce the Shangchuan line and launched an offensive from Chuancheng to the south, directly attacking Zhuqiao in an attempt to relieve the crisis in Chuancheng. The Chinese army, seeing that the Japanese forces in Shangchuan were heavily concentrated and relatively strong, abandoned their offensive on this route and turned to Shangnan,

turning defense into offense. The day before yesterday (the 9th) in the afternoon, another fierce engagement occurred in Xinchang Town in the 7th district of Nanhui. The Japanese troops on this route, originally advancing from Zhoupu, initially had a force of over 300 soldiers (including 200 new recruits), hoping to harass the Nanhui county seat from Xinchang. Unexpectedly, over 200 soldiers were diverted to reinforce Chuansha, leaving only over 100 soldiers in Shangnan, who were surrounded by the Chinese army in Xinchang and

found themselves in bitter fighting. From the afternoon of the 9th, the battle continued into the night, with the sound of artillery fire rumbling incessantly. Both sides used close-range machine-gun fire. The Chinese army initially adopted a defensive posture, but after learning that two-thirds of the Japanese forces had been diverted, they took advantage of their weakness and launched a fierce counterattack. After a half-day and night of fighting, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses yesterday morning and retreated to their original stronghold in Zhoupu. The Chinese army is pursuing their victory and has a momentum that directly threatens Zhoupu. Yesterday, the Japanese military on the Shangnan front

found themselves in a tense situation. The Ogawa unit again requested the return of the over 200 reinforcements that had been sent to the Zhihong unit in Chuansha on the morning of the 9th. This unit had been extremely frustrated after their unsuccessful attacks in Chuansha and Zhuqiao. Yesterday, they were ordered to return to Shangnan and at 2:00 PM, they boarded the Shangchuan train and arrived at Gaomiao Town along the Pu River at 4:00 PM, where they boarded two small steamers to Nanhuangpu to reinforce the Shangnan line. Running back and forth, they are exhausted and lack the will to fight. Therefore, although they were able to hold their stronghold after returning to Zhoupu, they lack the strength to launch another offensive.

### Japanese Consul-General Visits Concession Authorities; Requests the Suppression of Terrorists; No Mention of Shooting Incidents in Japanese-Controlled Areas; Japanese Newspapers Continue Malicious Attacks

The English-language "China Press" reports that in the wake of repeated terrorist incidents in western Shanghai, Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura Yoshiaki, accompanied by a Japanese consul, visited the authorities of the two concessions on Friday, making an oral request to "exert pressure to curb the activities of terrorists in the two concessions." Miura first visited Mr. Fessenden and General MacNaghten, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Municipal Council, stating that the Japanese authorities wished to see the Public Concession maintain its peace and order. They then exchanged views on recent terrorist incidents and how to deal with them. However, Japanese sources did not mention the repeated shooting incidents occurring in the Japanese-controlled areas such as Jessfield Road. Miura then visited French Consul-General Baudoin, making the same request regarding peace and order in the French Concession, although there have been no assassinations or political killings in the French Concession for some time. It is reported that Japanese newspapers have recently made malicious attacks on the Police Department, claiming that it is powerless and that the Police Department's attempt to control assassinations is "hypocritical." However, the Japanese newspapers have not said a word about the Japanese authorities' refusal to cooperate with the Police Department, such as the failure to hand over the captured bandits in Fahuazhen, resulting in the escape of four. It is not mentioned in the Japanese sources whether this matter was discussed during Miura's visit to the Concession authorities.

### Various Places Encourage Female Workers to Go to Sichuan; Develop the Southwest and Increase Production

Since the National Army's westward withdrawal, factories have been developing in the southwest. The government authorities have formulated measures to settle female workers entering Sichuan, sending notices to various provinces and cities to handle the matter. The Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday ordered the governments of Chuansha, Nanhui, and other counties to encourage female workers to enter Sichuan. The measures are as follows: Female workers who are familiar with the work of cotton mills must be forced to work in factories. Female workers who have been introduced to work will still be provided with accommodation. Those who cannot be settled in work will still be provided with food and accommodation. Negotiate with clothing factories for clothing materials, which will be taken out and made by female workers. Sewing machines will be rented by the New Transport General Association, and the rent will be deducted from wages. Shenxin Cotton Mill needs 100 female workers, and the labor leader will register them. Those who have relatives to help or seek their own way will be allowed to do so. Funds will be temporarily requisitioned from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The number of female workers who have or do not have work will be notified by the New Transport General Association to various agencies at any time for investigation.

Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Invitations to Raise Funds; Public-spirited people in Shanghai, recognizing the importance of relieving refugees, have initiated an exhibition of ancient and modern invitations to raise funds for disaster relief. Preparations are now underway. Once used, these invitations would have been waste paper. Now, collected together, they present a dazzling array that is quite impressive and also serves as a good reference material for those engaged in social service and dealing with worldly affairs. The association is now widely collecting items and has already obtained many novel and valuable items. In the future, a public exhibition will be held, and admission tickets will be sold.

The preparation and receiving address is No. 14 Ningbo Road and Renli.

### French Mail Steamer "Athos" Collides with "Izumo"; Caused by High Waves and Difficulty in Turning; One Floating Pier Sinks; Minor Damage to French Mail Steamer

The "North-China Daily News" reports that the French mail steamer Athos II collided with the Japanese flagship Izumo near the Garden Bridge yesterday afternoon (the 10th) while attempting to turn around, sinking the Japanese mail shipping company's Hongkou pier's central floating pier. It also caused significant damage to the superstructure of the tugboat Caroline Moller, which was docked nearby downstream. The Athos suffered only minor damage itself. From the outside, it appears that only

some of the white paint on the hull was scraped off. The captain of the ship told reporters last night that the various parts of the ship that collided with the pier and tugboat are currently being inspected in detail. The ship's personnel claimed that the unfortunate incident was entirely due to the wind and rapid current. The Athos arrived from Wusong yesterday afternoon, and the pilot, as usual,

attempted to turn around before mooring at the Gonghexiang pier. Before the turn was completed, it collided with the Izumo, which was docked next to the mail pier. Fortunately, the collision was minor, only scraping off part of the golden chrysanthemum decorating the bow of the Izumo. A few minutes later, the middle floating pier of the pier was hit hard, causing it to begin to sink. The French mail steamer then collided with the bow of the tugboat Caroline Moller,

causing significant damage. As for whether there was any other damage to the tugboat, it was not known for sure last night because another Moller tugboat was docked next to the Caroline, obstructing the view. The Athos eventually docked at its intended pier. When the ship was investigated, the blame was placed on the wind and strong river current. When reporters asked Captain Boyer last night, he admitted that the accident was related to the wind and strong river current, but said there were other reasons that he could not elaborate on until

he reported to the authorities. After the Athos incident, it did not remain in Shanghai but will set sail according to its original schedule. According to well-informed sources, if there is any minor damage to the ship, it will be repaired before leaving Shanghai. The Water Police and port officials are currently investigating the cause of the accident, but no details have been released as of late last night.

### British Military Commander Returns Home Yesterday; Many Well-Wishers See Him Off

The "North-China Daily News" reports that Major General Smart, the outgoing British military commander in Shanghai, who took office in August 1936, left Shanghai for England today (the 11th) with his wife, where he will transfer to Guernsey as governor. Many people gave farewell to Major General Smart the day before yesterday. The British Royal Air Force Association held a banquet at the HSBC Building at noon to bid farewell to Smart. President Batterley presented Smart with a wine glass engraved with a title and delivered a

farewell speech. Those attending the meeting included Colonel Henchman, commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and 70 officers of the British and American forces stationed in Shanghai. At 2:00 PM, representatives of the armed forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai and a guard of honor from two British regiments were lined up at the Customs Wharf. The inspection of the troops stationed in various countries by Smart. The farewell exercise originally scheduled for 11:00 AM at the racecourse was canceled due to inclement weather and was replaced by a guard of honor from the British Army lined up at the Customs Wharf for a

formal farewell. Just after 2:00 PM, Smart arrived with Major Ashmore, first inspecting the Scottish Seaforth Highlanders guard of honor on the shore, then walking onto the pontoon to inspect the guard of honor of the East Surrey Regiment. Then, to the sound of the drums and flutes of the Seaforth Highlanders, he shook hands and said goodbye to the foreign military officers who came to see him off. A few minutes later, a small speedboat from the British warship Cardiff docked alongside the pier, and Smart boarded the boat to say goodbye to the Cardiff. When the boat sailed out of sight, the well-wishers

dispersed. The guard of honor also returned to camp on Shanghai Volunteer Corps trucks. Those who went to the wharf to see him off included British Consul-General Phillips and his family, Colonel Belletire, commander of the French forces stationed in Shanghai, Colonel Fagen, commander of the American forces, Admiral Silera, commander of the Italian navy in the Far East, Colonel Henchman, commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and Mr. Miura, the Japanese Consul-General stationed in Shanghai.

### Locally Produced Cotton Cannot Be Shipped to Shanghai; Chinese Factories Order Foreign Cotton; Approximately 300,000 Bales Ordered and Shipped to Shanghai in Batches; Market Demand Exceeds Supply; Factories Make Huge Profits

Since the Chinese government banned the shipping of cotton to Shanghai, and cotton in the war zone is controlled by the Japanese puppets, Chinese-owned yarn factories in the Shanghai concession area have been forced to order 300,000 bales of foreign cotton, which have been shipped to Shanghai in batches for use in spinning cotton yarn. Yarn factories have experienced abnormal growth since the war and have made huge profits last year. The details are as follows:

Locally Produced Cotton Cannot Be Shipped to Shanghai; The cotton industry has always been concentrated in Shanghai because Shanghai is the largest consumer of cotton and the largest trading market. After the war, the Chinese government prohibited the shipping and sale of cotton to Shanghai after Shanghai fell, so that cotton produced in Shaanxi, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, and other provinces could not be shipped to Shanghai. Cotton from Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui in the war zone was greatly reduced due to the influence of Japanese puppet control. Exports to Japan and the Kwantung Leased Territory in Korea and Taiwan increased sharply. Last year, it reached 1,217,471 metric tons, valued at 89,896,717 national currency yuan.

Manufacturers Order Foreign Cotton to Adjust; The Chinese-owned yarn factories in the Shanghai concession area are reducing the shipping of cotton to Shanghai in various places, so that there is a risk of lack of textile raw materials. They have no choice but to order foreign cotton from Brazil, India, Egypt, the United States, and other places. According to the "New Voice News Agency" reporter's exploration of the yarn industry yesterday, a total of 300,000 bales of foreign cotton have been ordered and shipped to Shanghai in batches, and it is expected that they will all arrive before the end of May. It is for use in spinning yarn in various yarn factories. 50,000 bales have already been shipped to Shanghai from Brazil and India, and Brazilian cotton is the most popular.

Chinese-Owned Yarn Factories Make Huge Profits; The Chinese-owned yarn factories within the concession are Shenxin No. 2 and No. 9, Xinyu No. 1 and No. 2, Hongzhang, Yong'an No. 3, Tongyi, Qinfeng, Datong, Heji Zhenye and other ten companies, with 385,632 spindles and 1,700 looms. After the war, production was reduced due to the destruction of yarn factories in the war zone, while the demand for yarn in the interior was high, resulting in soaring prices for Chinese yarn. The market supply fell short of demand, and each factory made a profit last year, ranging from one million to ten million, especially Shenxin and Xinyu.

Shanghai Yarn Factories Have the Most Japanese Companies; Foreign-owned yarn factories in Shanghai include four British-owned companies, Jardine Matheson, Public Welfare, Yangshupu, and Lunchang, with 44,616 spindles and 3,265 looms. There are 24 Japanese-owned companies, including Rihua, Shanghai, NeiWai, Tongxing, Gongda, Dakang, Toyota, Yufeng, and Donghua, with 1,324,140 spindles and 14,554 looms. British yarn is entirely for use in British factories for weaving, and Japanese yarn is dumped in the war zone and for use in various Chinese and foreign cotton weaving factories in Shanghai. Although profits were high last year, they were less than those of Chinese factories.

Transactions Increase Daily, Prices Gradually Rise; Yarn sales in Shanghai were very sluggish for several months after the outbreak of the war. Only 3,230 bales were traded in September of the year before last. Later, as transportation along the coast and inland slightly eased, various weaving factories in Shanghai resumed operations. Therefore, as consumption increased, transactions increased daily. 20,900 bales were traded in June last year, and 20,083 bales were traded in November. The sales areas were mostly inland, such as Guangdong, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and among peers. The price of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn was 288 yuan in July of the year before last and has now risen to 403 yuan.

### Min Opera to Help Refugees

The Fujian-based Sanshan Minyue Amateur Opera Troupe in Shanghai has been organized for many years and has performed three times, with remarkable results. It is especially welcomed by the Min people in Shanghai. Recognizing the suffering of the refugees in Shanghai and doing their best to help, they have been specially organized by gentry and merchants Chen Shaohua, Shen Xiaoxiang, He Fosen, Lin Jiamao, Zheng Benheng, Huang Youqing, Ye Darong, Yang Lizhu, Zhao Yuanguan, Huang Fengying, and other gentlemen to organize a preparatory committee. It is scheduled to perform at the Carlton Theatre at 6:00 PM on the 14th of this month. Seat tickets are numbered and priced at one yuan, two yuan, and three yuan. They are sold by various Min shops. The ticket proceeds will be allocated by the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to help refugees. The repertoire includes "Fan Saijiao," "Su Mei Sells Paintings," and "The Three Beauties' Strange Fate," all of which are very distinctive. The scenery is also excellent. It is expected that the Min people will enthusiastically attend.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Announces Vessel Navigation Restriction Rules. Approved Steamers Must Pay Public Welfare Fees Based on Tonnage. Passenger Ships Must Be Over 500 Tons.

In order to improve the water transport system, the Zhejiang Provincial Government decided to establish a maritime affairs management agency. After deliberation at a provincial government meeting, it was decided that transport vessels approved to operate in accordance with the Zhejiang Eastern Navigation Regulations would be charged a public welfare fee based on net tonnage. Coastal port vessel navigation restriction rules were established and issued to the Ningbo and Wenzhou-Taizhou defense commanders for compliance. The details are as follows:

Vessel Navigation Restriction Rules: Zhejiang Province Coastal Port Vessel Navigation Restriction Rules, Article 1: All vessels permitted to navigate in Zhejiang Province ports in accordance with the temporary regulations for navigation in various ports along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang and the south bank of the Qiantang River (hereinafter referred to as the "Temporary Navigation Regulations") shall comply with these rules. Article 2: When applying for a passage permit in accordance with Article 3 of the Temporary Navigation Regulations, each vessel must first declare its willingness to comply with all the provisions of these rules. If it carries passengers, its tonnage must be 500 tons or more, but this restriction does not apply to vessels traveling between small ports within the province. Article 3: Each approved vessel is permitted to operate on one of the following routes and is not allowed to operate on multiple routes simultaneously. However, with special permission, routes (C), (D), and (E) may include one or two additional ports. When changing routes, a new application for a passage permit must be submitted. A. Between ports outside the province and Ningbo. B. Between ports outside the province and Haimen. C. Between ports outside the province and Wenzhou. D. Between ports outside the province and Ruian. E. Between ports outside the province and Pingyang. Article 4: Vessels with approved passage permits must pay a public welfare fee when navigating on the approved route. For each outbound trip, the fee is one yuan per net ton. For each inbound trip, the fee is two yuan per net ton. Article 5: Vessels that violate the provisions of these rules shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Temporary Navigation Regulations. Article 6: After the implementation of these rules, all fees previously collected by various localities based on the tonnage of inbound and outbound vessels shall be discontinued. Article 7: Vessels are not allowed to carry contraband items privately. The entry and exit of all passengers and goods shall be subject to inspection. Inspection rules will be established separately. If inspectors engage in extortion or harassment, merchants are allowed to report it directly at any time. Once verified, they will be severely punished. Article 8: These rules shall be implemented after deliberation and promulgation by the Zhejiang Provincial Government.

Headquarters Explains Permit Application Procedures: The Tenth Army Group Headquarters provides the following explanation regarding Article 7 of the Temporary Navigation Regulations for Zhejiang Eastern Navigation, concerning the procedures for obtaining passage permits for independent professions such as lawyers, journalists, teachers, and doctors: Lawyers, doctors, teachers, and journalists all have identifiable statuses and cannot be clearly identified without valid credentials. Even litigants have subpoenas that can be verified. If there are no other circumstances, passage may be granted. Anyone in a profession that can be exempted from military service who must travel to Wenzhou, Taizhou, Shanghai, or other ports must provide legitimate proof to be allowed to exit. Regarding the evacuation of civilians from the rear of the war zone and the return of dispersed personnel from various agencies to their hometowns, evacuation of people is only permitted to safe areas in the rear. There is no reason to move in the direction of the Japanese. Anyone doing so is either a traitor or an enemy sympathizer and should be subject to the restrictions of Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Navigation Regulations. Dispersed personnel all have documentation from their respective agencies, such as letters of appointment, which are easily identifiable. Regarding men under the age of sixteen or over the age of forty-five, and women, exiting the area, the original regulations should still be followed strictly, as these regulations were originally intended to prevent desertion, and whether or not someone is of the appropriate age cannot be determined subjectively. Furthermore, the exit of these people can largely be encompassed by the people referred to in the first, second, and third items. It is unlikely that they would be exiting for no reason. Foreign nationals are only checked for suspicion of communicating with the Japanese and are not subject to restrictions. The above five items have been telegraphed to the Ningbo and Wenzhou-Taizhou defense commanders for compliance.

### Refusal to Increase Employment of Japanese Customs Officers. Japanese Pressure on Customs Fails. Customs States Inability to Accept Demands. Japanese Attempt to Exert Pressure Apparently Thwarted Again.

The Japanese side, in an attempt to undermine the entire administrative system of the Jianghai Customs, has spared no effort in applying various forms of pressure. Recently, they made an illegal representation to the British Deputy Commissioner of Customs, Mr. Rocher, demanding the increased employment of senior Japanese customs officers and seventy ordinary Japanese customs officers, in order to increase Japanese pressure and restrain customs administrative matters. It is understood that, after repeated consultations with the Inspector General of Customs by Mr. Rocher, it was deemed that the Japanese move was unjustified and that the customs authorities found it difficult to deal with. Therefore, the Japanese side has now been informed that all requests are completely rejected and cannot be accepted. The Japanese plot to put pressure on the customs has now failed.

### Guangdong Compatriots Perform Theater to Raise Funds. Feng Bingnan Explains the Significance. Helping Fellow Refugees is a Shared Good Deed. Everyone Fulfills Their Obligations, Converging on the Same Goal.

The Guangdong Compatriots Association, concerned about the serious plight of refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi, seized the opportunity of the Taishan Male and Female Theater Troupe's visit to Shanghai to launch a theatrical performance to raise funds for disaster relief. The situation was enthusiastic and the scale was grand. A committee for theatrical performance fundraising for refugee relief was formed, and Mr. Feng Bingnan was elected as the chairman, with Mr. Guo Shun and Mr. Guo Shenliang as the vice-chairmen. Mr. Feng gave a speech explaining the significance of this theatrical performance fundraising, which is recorded as follows: The Guangdong Compatriots Association in Shanghai is currently raising funds to help refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi, and to subsidize the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. The Taishan Male and Female Cantonese Opera Troupe has come to Shanghai to perform, and upon hearing the news, they spontaneously proposed to perform for our association without remuneration, to assist in this charitable cause. Their enthusiasm for public welfare is admirable. The Guangdong Compatriots Association in Shanghai has specially formed this association to expand this undertaking and is honored to have mistakenly elected me, Mr. Guo Shun, and Mr. Guo Zhongliang as the chairman and vice-chairmen of this association. Mr. Guo Shun and Mr. Guo Zhongliang are energetic and capable and will certainly be able to fulfill their duties happily. I have been ill for many years, staying at home to recuperate. My virtue is insufficient, and my body is weak. I am not capable of rushing about and exerting myself, nor can I effectively direct and command. Since I was born, I have always been willing to do my part in public welfare undertakings to the best of my ability, and I have never wanted to be behind others, nor do I want to occupy any title. However, today's matter is as urgent as saving someone from drowning. There is no time for ceremony and modesty, lest we fall into injustice. Moreover, my fellow countrymen are calling out for help everywhere, rescuing those in danger and providing disaster relief. Responses are coming from all directions. How can I refuse this title and not bear its weight? I can only offer my humble heart and strive to follow along. I think of the refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi, struggling in dire straits. The newspapers in Shanghai have occasionally reported on their plight and suffering. However, what those who have recently come to Shanghai from Guangdong and Guangxi have described and witnessed is beyond the power of pen and ink to describe, and even beyond the imagination of the mind. In short, the fields are full of wailing, and people are emaciated and covered in mud, urgently awaiting rescue. The sooner we raise funds, the more days they can live. The more people who donate, the more people can be saved. At the beginning of the war, Shanghai was the first to be affected. At that time, there was still much territory in our country intact, and it was easier to raise donations. Now, however, the flames of war are raging everywhere, and the disaster area is expanding. Everyone is struggling to save themselves, and begging for help is useless. Only the Shanghai Special Zone, with its abnormal commercial development last year, is still a relatively complete place. Therefore, the refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi cannot but hope that their compatriots in Shanghai will do their best to raise funds. This is the first reason. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been supporting refugees in Shanghai for many years, exhausting its heart and energy. While we are appealing on behalf of our hometown, we must also think of those who share the same difficulties. Therefore, we also plan to take this opportunity to share our resources and show our sympathy. This is the second reason. While the Guangdong Compatriots Association in Shanghai was considering and deliberating, the Taishan Theater Troupe suddenly arrived and expressed their support, planning this charitable performance. Their enthusiasm and determination are not only a great help to our association, but also inspire the members of our association and make them more energetic. All the performers in the troupe are using their superb artistic skills to represent our appeal. Their compassion is already moving. Ms. Li Xuefang, who has long retired from the stage, is motivated by public duty and is willing to reappear and perform again. This is rare among the rare. Ms. Li has been hailed as the "Fairy of Ten Songs" and her reputation is comparable to that of Dr. Mei Lanfang and Dr. Cheng Yanqiu. Since she retired from the stage, her performances have been lost. Now, on the red carpet, we can see her beautiful figure again, giving the people of Shanghai a new experience. It can be said to be a rare exception in the midst of national crisis. Since the performers are so aware of the importance of the cause, we must also actively promote it in order to fulfill our duty. However, the national crisis is deep, and we dare not easily speak of entertainment. Why use entertainment as a means of raising funds? In my opinion, although drama is a type of entertainment, it depends on the motive behind it. If it is entertainment for charity, then there must be thoughts of inspiring and moving the crowd during the singing and dancing. If it is charity through entertainment, then there must be more painful and generous songs after the return of the wind and snow. Now, the purpose of our association's theatrical performance is purely for good. Therefore, its joy is not comparable to entertainment. As the saying goes, "Doing good is the greatest joy." The joy of doing good always gives people an indescribable comfort in their limbs and bones. For example, when we do something that is right and just, we always feel that the white clouds in the sky and the flowing water in the mountains are joyful and leisurely, with a kind of tranquility and ease. Most of the philanthropists in Shanghai are always eager to contribute to public welfare undertakings. I know that they must have all tasted this greatest joy in the world. Therefore, we know that the purpose of this association's decision to perform is to allow the audience to enjoy the joy of doing good, rather than the joy of wonderful dances and happy songs.

Furthermore, the purpose of this association's theatrical performance is, of course, to help refugees, to show the meaning of sharing goodness with others. Its side effect is to express a warm response to the kindness of the Taishan Theater Troupe and all the performers, as well as Mrs. Wei Li Xuefang, and to show the superb art of the performers, so that people know that art is a product of emotion, and is by no means a tool for pleasing and pleasing the senses as ordinary people think. Those who feel the same as me are many, so I say that the performers and the audience will not use this move as a function of entertaining the mind and body, but all seek to do their duty to achieve the goal of doing good for the most pleasure. It may be said that the organization of this charitable event is a good thing that achieves three goals, as far as the association, the Taishan Theater Troupe, and the audience are concerned, although the gains are different, the joy is the same. The association has three gains: 1. Promote the original intention of doing good. 2. Enable the Taishan Theater Troupe to achieve its aspirations for doing good. 3. Allow the audience to enjoy the ultimate joy of doing good. The Taishan Theater Troupe and Mrs. Wei Li Xuefang also have three gains: 1. Help this association raise funds so that it can cultivate its strength for doing good. 2. Create more opportunities for the audience to do good. 3. Enable the performers to fulfill their aspirations to help refugees as much as possible. On the audience side, there are also three gains: 1. Help this association raise funds to achieve the goal of doing good thoroughly. 2. Enable the performers to achieve their common aspirations for doing good. 3. Allow themselves to have more opportunities to do good. Therefore, I deeply believe that this theatrical performance fundraising is by no means ordinary entertainment, but a duty that should be fulfilled in the national crisis. Not only do the members of this association hold this idea, but the performers and the audience must also share this concept. However, members of this association, such as the chairman and vice-chairmen Guo Shun and Guo Zhongliang, and Mr. Li Ze, Cui Pinxi, Jiang Hechun, Chen Qifen, Chen Qihao, Liang Haichou, Liang Weisi, He Quansheng, and Guo Qiming, have been rushing about day and night. As for myself, I have been ill for a long time and have not been able to follow my colleagues, which is deeply regrettable. The male and female performers of the Taishan Theater Troupe, Gui Mingyang, Luo Jiaquan, Wen Huamei, etc., as well as Mrs. Wei Li Xuefang, have also worked hard to assist in creating this situation in a short period of time. Their strength is truly astonishing. Today, I cannot help but express my gratitude and joy. In addition to my own admiration and gratitude, I must represent the members of this association, the fellow countrymen, the refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi, and the refugees in Shanghai, to express my deep gratitude, and to express my advance welcome and gratitude to the audience, and to hope that both fellow countrymen and non-fellow countrymen will actively participate to fulfill their duties in the national crisis, to promote this good deed, and to share the greatest joy. I cannot express my great wish enough.

### There Are 200,000 Guerrillas in Japanese-Occupied Areas. Japanese Spokesman Admits Without Hesitation.

The Continental News reports that at a reception for reporters held by the Japanese side last night (the 10th), a reporter asked a question after the Japanese military spokesman announced that the Japanese army was fighting with guerrillas. The spokesman replied that there were 200,000 guerrillas fighting in the Japanese-occupied areas. The spokesman further replied that the Japanese army in China was currently fully engaged in "mopping-up operations."

### A Terrible Smallpox Epidemic Is Spreading in Tokyo. Members of Parliament and the Imperial Family Are Wary. It Is Even Claimed That the Smallpox Bacteria Were Brought from Shanghai.

The North China Daily News reports that yesterday (the 10th) the Japanese-language Continental New News carried a Tokyo dispatch stating that more than 100 cases of a terrible smallpox epidemic had occurred in Tokyo last month, compared to only 60 cases in the entire year of last year. Four cases have recently occurred near the Tokyo Parliament building, so members of parliament and others are also wary and are being vaccinated against smallpox to prevent infection. Moreover, because the Imperial Palace is close to the Parliament, special preventive measures are being taken. Princes and their families of the Imperial Family, as well as personnel of the High Court, are also being vaccinated. Three thousand people, including the Minister of the Imperial Household, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, and other personnel of the Imperial Household Ministry, were specially ordered to be vaccinated last Tuesday. Officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs say that the current smallpox epidemic was transmitted from Shanghai, as Japanese travelers brought the bacteria back with them from Shanghai. Travelers returning from "Manchukuo" have not been found to have contracted the disease.

Zheng Mengyuan, a Chaozhou native and owner of Taihe Pawnshop on Rue Albert, French Concession, possesses assets worth five to six million gold. His son, Zheng Zuoxuan, 21 years old this year, frequented dance halls three years ago, resulting in cohabitation with Wu Xi dancer Zhang Xiuying (19 years old this year, residing at No. 4, Lane 42, Route Doumer). Zhang has now retained a lawyer to file a suit in the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court against Zheng Zuoxuan, seeking

Fulfillment of Contract. According to the plaintiff's complaint, the plaintiff and defendant met through an introduction in 1935. The defendant was immediately captivated and claimed to be unmarried, expressing a desire to marry the plaintiff. At that time, the plaintiff's will was weak and she was persuaded, and they cohabited at No. 76 Jing'an Villa. On August 18, 1938, the defendant himself

Invited a Lawyer to be Present and entered into a contract with the plaintiff, stipulating that they would marry by September 22 of the same year. If there were any violations, the defendant would willingly compensate the plaintiff with 50,000 yuan for living expenses. When the deadline arrived, the defendant failed to fulfill the marriage contract and, upon being questioned, claimed that his parents had arranged another marriage for him, so he could not fulfill the contract. He stated that he would pay the promised compensation in installments. Unexpectedly, the defendant neither fulfilled the marriage contract nor paid the promised compensation. However, the defendant is a

Son of a Wealthy Family and spends thousands upon thousands on daily expenses outside. The court is requested to recover the stipulated amount. Upon receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Wu Xiaoge, summoned both parties to Courtroom 7 of the Civil Division for a hearing at 3:00 PM yesterday. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The plaintiff's lawyer first stated the circumstances, and the defendant's lawyer, Sun Zuji, replied and filed a counterclaim,

Requesting Dismissal of the Plaintiff's Suit and Cancellation of the contract signed by both parties on August 18 and October 3, 1938. It was stated that the plaintiff was originally a dancer, and under the instigation of her mother, the defendant, who had just left school and was inexperienced, was unduly seduced and forced to sign this contract, which was illegal and should be dismissed and the contract canceled. After the lawyers for both parties argued their respective cases, the court found that the case required further investigation and adjourned the hearing to a later date, and the court was adjourned.

### Guerrillas Kill Puppet Officers in Beixinjing, One Dead, One Escaped, One Abducted. Japanese Soldiers Search for Traces Without Success.

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) At around 10:00 AM yesterday, three rickshaws were traveling on the Beixinjing Avenue in northwestern Shanghai, with one person sitting upright in each rickshaw. Each rickshaw's footboard had a large package of salt. As they approached Zhoujiaqiao, six burly men claiming to be guerrillas, armed with Mauser pistols, suddenly jumped out from the roadside, intercepted the three rickshaws, searched them, and interrogated the passenger in the first rickshaw. The passenger was about to reply that he was a salted pork merchant when the two passengers in the second and third rickshaws at the rear claimed to the guerrillas that they were inspectors from the Zhoujiaqiao branch of the Salt Bureau and that the salt on the rickshaws had just been intercepted from the Beixinjing area. As they spoke, they presented their badges. After the guerrillas inspected them, they realized that they were puppet officers from the puppet organization and immediately opened fire. One of them was hit twice and died on the spot. One escaped into a rice store and survived. Another was abducted without a trace. Afterwards, someone reported the incident to the Japanese military police headquarters, who first transported the deceased away and searched the nearby area, but there was no trace of the abducted person. It was later learned that the deceased was named Li Deqing, from Changshu, and the abducted person was named Chen Yuquan, from Huzhou.

Another report states that at around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 10th), three impoverished old women were carrying 20-30 catties of salt on their shoulders, selling it along the street in Beixinjing Town in northwestern Shanghai. Suddenly, three puppet tax police from the puppet "Municipal Government" came forward, seized the three old women, and, along with the salt, sent them to the puppet self-government association in the town for interrogation. Later, the guerrillas in the town learned of this and rushed to the rescue. As they walked to the Shiqiao pier on Dongda Street, they caught sight of the three puppet tax police approaching. The guerrillas immediately drew their pistols and fired at the puppet police, killing one of them on the spot, who fell into a pool of blood on the riverside west of the stone bridge. The other two escaped. The deceased was identified as Li Debiao, 28 years old, from Anhui, with a bamboo cloth armband on his arm, which read "Tax Police Second Team, Dadao Municipal Government." It is now reported that Wang Ao, the "chairman" of the town's "self-government association," and Pan Langhuan, Hou Zhuying, and Qin, the "vice-chairmen," were detained by Japanese soldiers yesterday and sent to the Japanese military police headquarters on Lincoln Road for questioning.

### Former Clerk of Exchange Trust Office Embezzles Public Funds, Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison.

Huang Qixian, from Haimen, served as an old clerk at the Jiuyou Shanghai-Chang Exchange Trust Office in Room 711, Continental Building, 9 Jiangxi Road. At 1:00 PM on the 25th of last month, he was ordered by manager Ma Yunxiang to go to Yusheng Exchange on 30 Tianjin Road to collect a check for 3,000 yuan from Jin Cheng Bank, and instructed to deposit the check in the Continental Bank. Huang did not comply, but after obtaining the check, he cashed it and absconded without a trace. Jiuyou reported the incident to the police, requesting an arrest warrant. It was not until the day before yesterday that Chief Detective Yang Peisheng and Detective Zhou Zhenxing of the General Police Department arrested Huang at No. 14 Zhicheng Lane, Gallic Road, and seized the original stolen goods of 2,602 yuan. They took him back to the police station. Under interrogation, Huang fully confessed and said that the remaining money had been lost at the Liyuan gambling den on Jiaozhou Road. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special No. 1 Court, and police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him under Article 336 of the Criminal Code. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, Huang was sentenced to eight months in prison as a warning, and the stolen goods were returned to the owner.

### Members of the Puppet "Self-Defense Corps" Released by the Court, But Taken Away by Someone.

On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, at around 9:00 PM, the search team of the Lao Zha Police Department seized three people, Wu Tianbao from Zhejiang, Li Jishan from Yangzhou, and Lu Jiabao from Shanghai, near the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road. Two Mauser pistols, one handgun, and 27 bullets were seized. It was found that Wu and the others were planning to join the "Self-Defense Corps" organized by the puppet "Municipal Government" and were sent to the Special No. 1 Court with a request for detention for investigation into whether they had committed any crimes within the Concession, as reported in this newspaper. Now that the police have determined that Wu and the others have not committed any crimes within the Concession, the police have applied to the Special No. 1 Court for the withdrawal of the detention of Wu and the others. The Special Court has approved the release. However, it is reported that after Wu and the others were released from the police station, they were taken away by someone. What the result was is unknown.

### Loss of Both Life and Property, Account Clerk Hangs Himself. Corpse Claimed for Burial by the Owner of the Paili Company.

Gu Chongyao, a native of Daozhen, Huzhou, 37 years old this year, was an accountant at Paili Native Products Company at No. 491 Avenue Joffre. Gu had married two wives, who both died of illness. Each wife had a child. Gu's parents were deceased, and he was a businessman working outside. Since there was

No One to Care for them at Home, the two children were fostered with an aunt from the same clan. He would return every two or three months to visit them. When the war broke out, Gu's hometown was devastated, but fortunately his house was still standing. Recently, Gu took leave to return to his hometown to see his children. Unexpectedly, because guerrillas were attacking the Japanese army in the countryside, the Japanese army became enraged and set fire to all the villages and houses where Gu lived, and the two children and their aunt were also missing.

Their Fate Unknown. In addition, Gu had 800 yuan in cash deposited in a money house in Wuzhen. Unexpectedly, the money house also closed down due to the war, and all the deposits were lost. Gu suffered a series of blows and became mentally unstable after returning to Shanghai, feeling that life was no longer interesting, resulting in a short-sighted act. On the night of the 10th, after finishing work at the Paili Company, he went to his dormitory at No. 47, Lane 205, Wangzhi Road, and

Hanged Himself with a Belt, following his parents and two wives to the underworld. At 10:00 PM that night, Xiang Daquan (25 years old, from Haimen), a clerk from the Paili Native Products Company, returned to the dormitory to sleep and discovered it upon entering the room. He immediately called the second landlord, Chen Lu (39 years old, from Zhenjiang), and neighbors to rescue him, but it was too late, and he had already died. He then reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate and transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy.

Unable to Locate the Family, the owner of the Paili Company, Bao Liqing (28 years old, from Suzhou), reported to Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Special No. 2 Court yesterday and accompanied the forensic doctor to the hall. The autopsy confirmed that the deceased, Gu Chongyao, had indeed died by hanging himself. Employer Bao Liqing stated that the deceased's family was in the countryside and could not be found easily for the time being. He was willing to temporarily claim the body for coffin burial and wait for the family to claim it later. Prosecutor Wang approved, ordering a written guarantee to be provided for claiming the body.

### Coal Briquette Factory Owner Assassinated: Two Shots Followed by Ax Blows

Luo Yi, a 38-year-old man from Shaoxing, residing at No. 1, Lu Jia Lane, Rue Massenet, in the French Concession, owned the Jiangnan Coal Briquette Factory at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Changping Road in Western Shanghai. Due to the high demand in society, the business was very prosperous. Yesterday around noon, Luo was taking a rickshaw from his home to the factory to handle business matters. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw reached the entrance of the He Yu Electroplating Factory near the intersection of Changping Road, three men, who had been lying in wait, suddenly jumped out from the roadside and blocked Luo's path. One of the three men held a pistol, while the other two wielded sharp axes. The man with the pistol immediately fired two shots at Luo. The bullets hit Luo's left shoulder and exited through his waist, causing him to immediately collapse to the ground. The ax-wielding men rushed forward and violently hacked Luo's head five times, causing blood to splatter everywhere and Luo to be on the verge of death, barely breathing. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the three assailants immediately fled in separate directions without a trace. By the time the patrol officers arrived, it was already too late to pursue them. They summoned a vehicle to take the injured man to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, his life was in critical danger. At the same time, the police are thoroughly investigating the case and are strictly pursuing the murderers. The motive for the attack is still difficult to ascertain.

Gatekeeper Stabbed: Tong Jinshou, a 44-year-old man from Xuzhou, residing at No. 222, Lane 33, South Chengdu Road, worked as a gatekeeper at Fumin Village, Rue Foochow, in the Public Concession (Badge No. 1698). Yesterday at 3:30 AM, while Zhou was on duty in the lane, two people suddenly approached him and asked to borrow the handgun he was carrying. After Zhou refused, he angered the three men. At that time, one person immediately pulled out a sharp axe and hacked Zhou's head twice. Zhou was injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the three fled in separate directions. Later, Chinese Constable No. 2500 sent him to the hospital for treatment in a vehicle. It is said that his injuries are severe and his life is in danger.

Foreman Slashed: Zhang Maohai, a 27-year-old man from Shandong, worked as a foreman in the spinning room of the Xinyu No. 1 Yarn Factory at No. 37, West Suzhou Road. Yesterday morning around 6:00 AM, when Zhang went to the factory to work, he was suddenly attacked by Wang San, a worker who had been laid off by the factory, who pulled out a sharp axe and hacked Zhang all over his body. He sustained more than ten injuries, bled profusely, and fell to the ground unconscious. By the time the nearby Chinese constables arrived, the murderer had already fled without a trace. The injured man was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment, and his life is in critical condition.

### Jiang Yusheng Memorial Service

Jiang Yusheng, a giant in the Shanghai construction industry, passed away due to illness on December 3rd of last year. At that time, his eldest son, Dr. Changchuan, had not returned from the World Christian Conference in India, so the memorial service was postponed until 2:00 PM yesterday. It was held at Moore Memorial Church. Hundreds of Jiang's relatives and friends came to offer their condolences. Organizations such as the Shanghai Construction Factory Association and Tonghui Elementary School also offered sacrifices. The hall was filled with memorial banners and elegiac couplets. Finally, a memorial service was held according to religious rituals. The order included scripture reading, a biography, speeches, hymns, etc., which was exceptionally solemn and grand, expressing deep sorrow at his passing.

### Lawyer Peng Qixiu Sued for Fraudulent Acquisition of Property: Civil Part Resolved in Court, Criminal Part Rescheduled for Further Hearing

Lawyer Peng Qixiu, a native of Shaoxing, is being privately prosecuted in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court by Chen Hongqing, a Muslim (equivalent in status to priests and pastors in the Catholic and Protestant faiths), for fraudulent acquisition of property, requesting legal investigation. According to the complaint, Chen Hongqing stated that he rented a house belonging to the Xu Jia Hui Road Mosque and owed more than 190 yuan in rent. The landlord commissioned Lawyer Peng to represent him in suing Chen in the Civil Court. Lawyer Peng kindly mediated on his behalf, agreeing that Chen would pay 14 yuan in monthly rent and not be in arrears, and also pay 6 yuan per month to settle the previous arrears, totaling 20 yuan per month. He asked Chen to pay two months in advance. Chen complied and delivered 40 yuan for two months' rent to Lawyer Peng in April of last year. However, the case still could not be settled, and the money remained with Peng. Despite repeated demands and letters of urging, the money was not returned. He had no choice but to file a lawsuit for investigation, attaching a civil complaint, etc. The defendant, Peng Qixiu, admitted to receiving 40 yuan from the plaintiff. Because the landlord did not agree to a settlement, the matter was delayed. He was willing to return the money, but it was past the bank's withdrawal time today, and tomorrow is Sunday, and the day after tomorrow is Monday. He decided to return the full amount of money. The court verified the statements and mediated the civil part of the case in court, creating a record of the settlement. The criminal part was rescheduled for further verification.

### Opening a Coffin Storage Facility Fails, Disputes Arise Over Shares: Shares Transferred as Loans, Chairman Suddenly Denies and Criminally Sues the Manager for Forgery

Chen Pengnian, a real estate merchant from Ningbo residing at No. 38, Xuehua Lane, Rue Chévert, in the French Concession, and Chen Yunfei, were recently sued by Dong Yunyan, Yu Chengxiu, and Lawyer Huang Zengjie, filing a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing them of forgery, illegal use of seals, perjury, etc. The indictment stated that the defendant, Chen Pengnian, previously partnered with the plaintiff to open the Fushou Coffin Storage Facility, with the plaintiff serving as chairman and the defendant, Chen Pengnian, as manager. Chen Yunfei was Chen's relative and was introduced by him to work at the facility as an administrator. However, Chen Pengnian failed to obtain a business license for the coffin storage facility, resulting in huge losses. He colluded with Chen Yunfei to forge a withdrawal agreement and a loan agreement, suing the plaintiff in civil court for the return of a 2,000 yuan deposit. Because the plaintiff was bedridden at the time and unable to appear in court, he was deceived. The Civil Court ordered the plaintiff to repay the full amount. Currently, after returning to Shanghai from Haimen, he inquired from various sources and learned that the so-called loan agreement was written by Gu Nianchun at the request of the first defendant, using blank paper bearing the plaintiff's seal. He requested that handwriting analysis be performed to clarify the truth. Although the plaintiff did not dare to confirm that the seal was forged before authentication, the defendant's guilt of illegally using the seal and forging documents was unavoidable. Chen Yunfei, pretending to be the plaintiff's secretary, was also responsible for jointly forging the withdrawal agreement. They should be charged under Articles 210, 218, and 168 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant Chen Yunfei was absent, and only Chen Pengnian appeared with his defense lawyers Qian Xingzhong and Zhang Juansheng.

Presented a defense, stating that the defendant had invested 2,000 yuan in shares in the Fushou Coffin Storage Facility. Later, because the facility could not be established, the plaintiff proposed operating a new economic village. The defendant did not agree and expressed his withdrawal from the partnership. The plaintiff, in his capacity as chairman of the facility, signed a transfer agreement with the defendant on June 19th. The 2,000 yuan in shares that the facility owed the defendant was negotiated to be treated as a loan. The plaintiff also issued a loan agreement on the same day, limiting the repayment to within three months. The defendant took the transfer agreement and the loan agreement to the Xinfu Real Estate Company at No. 6, World Lane, Fuzhou Road. After a friend, Wu Zikun, read it, he believed that the words "and voluntarily waive the right to prior lawsuit defense" should be added to the loan agreement. The defendant immediately asked the plaintiff for consent, who agreed to accept it. However, because the secretary had already left, the defendant asked Gu Nianchun, a secretary at the Pingheng Law Firm, to rewrite it on another piece of paper, and took it along with the original loan agreement to the plaintiff to have him stamp it again. At the same time, the facility's architect, Ma Pinqi, was also present and can testify. Later, because the facility declared its closure, the defendant sent letters to the plaintiff on August 3rd and 9th, urging him to repay the loan, but to no avail. He had no choice but to petition the Civil Court, which had already made a judgment and was determined to enforce it. The investigation revealed that during the civil lawsuit, the plaintiff never claimed that the loan was forged by the defendant. Suddenly, when the defendant claimed the funds, the plaintiff declared that he had filed a criminal lawsuit and requested a stay of execution. This was malicious and self-evident. It must be known that the ironclad evidence of the civil judgment cannot be overturned by empty words. He requested that a verdict of not guilty be issued. Under Judge Xiao's questioning, he instructed both parties to go out and attempt a settlement. The case was rescheduled for another hearing.

### French Concession Authorities Ban Fireworks

The police authorities of the French Concession, in view of the imminent passing of the lunar New Year and the current extraordinary period, deeply feared that the general ignorant residents still have the bad habit of setting off firecrackers under various pretexts, which would affect the security within the concession. They issued a notice yesterday to ban them, stating: "Notice: In view of the current situation, for the sake of security, the sale or setting off of firecrackers within the French Concession is not allowed under any pretext. Violators will be arrested and may be fined from one yuan to one hundred yuan. Therefore, the ban is reiterated. This notice is hereby issued."

### Boy Run Over and Killed on Xinzha Road: No. 10 Public Bus Causes Accident, Boy's Brain Splattered

Yesterday afternoon at around 12:45, in front of the laundry shop at No. 470 Xinzha Road (east end of Chengdu Road) in the Public Concession, a No. 3 tram with a trailer was stopped there, waiting for a No. 3 tram traveling from west to east to pass. At this time, a boy of about ten years old, resembling a student, wanted to cross the road in front of the tram. Unexpectedly, a No. 10 public bus came straight from west to east. The boy was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked down, lying face down on the tram tracks. The wheels of the No. 10 public bus ran over his abdomen, back, and head. The boy's intestines flowed out, his brain splattered, and he was dragged by the wheels for more than ten feet. The scene was bloody and gruesome. When the patrol officers arrived, they summoned an ambulance to take him to the hospital, but he had already died. The driver of the offending bus was recorded, and he will be punished.

### British Boy Injured Playing with Hand Grenade

Yesterday afternoon at 3:20, at No. 2501, Route Bilienan, a British boy of about ten years old was holding a hand grenade and playing with it.

### Robbery of 7,000 Yuan: Gunfire Used to Resist Arrest, Resulting in One Bandit Being Captured and 7,000 Yuan Recovered Intact

The Yongtaihe Tobacco Company at No. 784 Jiujiang Road has a branch company in Dapuqiao, French Concession. Yesterday morning at 8:30, the branch company ordered a clerk to carry over 7,000 yuan in cash to the head office. He took Public Bus No. 21 to the Great World on Avenue Edward VII, then changed to Trolleybus No. 18 to the intersection of Rue Yu-tsia-tsing and Nanjing Road. As he walked to the intersection of Rue Yu-tsia-tsing and Jiujiang Road, nearing the head office, three bandits who had been lying in wait suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two bandits, armed with pistols, stepped forward and forcibly robbed the clerk of the 7,000 yuan in cash he was carrying. Just as they were about to flee with the loot, they were spotted by Chinese Constable No. 100 on patrol, who rushed to arrest them. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest, and the constable also drew his gun and returned fire. Gunshots rang out, and bullets flew everywhere. The two sides exchanged more than ten shots. Fortunately, there were few people on the street, and no one was injured. Other Chinese constables heard the commotion and joined in the pursuit. They chased the bandits to the vicinity of Cide Lane on Jiujiang Road, where they apprehended one of the bandits, seizing a pistol, six bullets, and the original stolen cash of 7,000 yuan. The other two bandits escaped.

The index for this month was 170.16, higher than last month by 1.53%. (Child Protection Division) After obtaining the consent of the Jiliang Institute and with the approval of the Chief of Police, the Timber Department's Industrial Section decided to send oppressed or lost women who were noticed by various police stations to the Jiliang Institute on Niuzhuang Road. A total of 39 cases were handled last month. The categories are as follows: abduction 16, intimidation and abduction 2, maids 10, lost girls 9, rescued prostitutes 2. Apart from one girl who died, the court's decisions were as follows: 12 were sent to the Jiliang Institute, 7 to the Ciyou Association, 7 to the Women and Children Relief Association, 2 to other institutions, 1 to the Puci Sanitarium, 1 to the Red Cross Hospital, and 8 were claimed by relatives or guardians.

The current extraordinary situation makes it quite difficult for various agencies to handle adopted children. This issue must be carefully studied in the future. Some agencies have requested the assistance of the Industrial Section in training children to learn handicrafts. One factory that produces handicrafts has contacted the agency. In the future, the Industrial Section will adopt a more progressive policy for the protection of children. Children or adults who have left their own families, even if they have not been reported by the police station, will also be included in the scope of attention.

### Local Bullies in Sijiao Act as Accomplices, Monopolizing Sand and Gravel Transportation to Shanghai: Boatmen and Coolies Strike in Opposition, Association Issues Public Notice Calling for Action Yesterday

Yellow sand is the main raw material for engineering and construction. Since the fall of Shanghai, due to the sudden increase in residents within the concessions, the construction industry has shown a booming trend. Therefore, the demand for yellow sand is extremely urgent. Merchants in the industry hire sailing boats to purchase and transport it from the sand pits of Sijiao. Now, a local bully named Jin from the area has joined forces with Chinese traitors to organize a sand and gravel company, monopolizing everything. They have detained more than 20 imported sand and gravel sailing boats, including those belonging to Qiu Wende, using special forces. Workers and boatmen in the sand and gravel industry are forced to make a living and are outraged. They have launched a unified strike and industry-wide shutdown starting today, vowing to oppose it to the death. After receiving reports from colleagues, the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Industry Association issued a public notice yesterday calling on all parties to stop it. According to a recent report jointly signed by members of our association, a local bully named Jin from Sijiao has colluded with a certain party to organize the "Wantai Company," attempting to monopolize the transportation of sand and gravel to Shanghai and exclusively profit. Such a motive will inevitably wipe out the livelihoods of the people in the sand pits, boatmen, coolies, and hundreds of members. The industry is outraged and fears that they will take risks and cause trouble. Therefore, we are writing to your association to seek assistance. The transportation of sand and gravel to Shanghai is essential for the construction of the concessions and is also the livelihood of the poor. Once monopolized, it will inevitably affect people's livelihood, and it is difficult to ensure that there will be no accidents. Our association is limited by the environment and cannot do anything. Therefore, we are issuing this public notice, hoping that all sectors will rise up to stop it, maintain the livelihoods of tens of thousands of poor people, and plan ahead to prevent incidents. We urge you to do so."

### Financial North China Foreign Banks Again Vigorously Absorbing Foreign Exchange

The Result of Chinese and Western Businesses Competing to Sell is Not Yet Severe

The exchange market yesterday was favorable to the North China foreign banks, which vigorously absorbed foreign exchange. The major foreign firms were also chasing after, causing the underlying trend to be quite tight. The pound sterling once retreated to eight pence one two five, while HSBC maintained its price. The US dollar also softened to fifteen yuan eight seven five. However, in the end, due to the competing selling of Hong Kong Electric, Sassoon, and Jardine Matheson, the resulting tightness was not too severe. There were slight fluctuations in the middle, and trading was quite active. The Hong Kong dollar also continued to soften due to the vigorous buying by foreign firms.

In the early morning, the London large telegraphic transfer (T/T) for near term contracted by 0.0625, and the long term also decreased by 125. The New York spot remained unchanged. The London raw gold also had no increase or decrease. The exchange rate of the pound against the dollar contracted by 0.13, against the franc it improved, and against Shanghai it fell by 0.0625. The dollar against the pound decreased by 0.25, against the franc contracted by 0.0625, and against Shanghai remained level. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The banks opened early, with the spot selling price of the pound at eight pence one four zero six two five, and the dollar at fifteen yuan nine zero six two five, which was 0.03125 tighter for both the pound and dollar compared to the previous day. After the opening, the North China foreign banks and foreign firms suddenly became active, competing to vigorously absorb foreign exchange. HSBC, Chartered Bank, American Express, and other foreign banks only quoted eight pence one two five for the pound and fifteen yuan eight seven five for the dollar, so the situation was quite soft. HSBC's listed price announcement was unchanged, and the silver equalization tax announcement was small at 0.25, with an assessment of 6.00%. After this, although the foreign banks still came with force to absorb foreign exchange, the selling intentions of Hong Kong Electric, Western firm Sassoon, Chinese banks, and Jardine Matheson were quite strong, so the underlying trend turned looser and harder. Hong Kong Electric, Sassoon, Jardine Matheson, and Chinese banks sold the pound at eight pence one four zero six two five, and the dollar at fifteen yuan nine zero six two five to Holland Bank. The most banks and money changers quoted 54.5 yuan for the Hong Kong dollar, and the market situation was also tight. By the time of the noon closing, the banks' selling prices were eight pence one four zero six two five for the pound and fifteen yuan nine zero six two five for the dollar. As a result, the pound and dollar were both 0.03125 tighter compared to the previous closing, and the Hong Kong dollar also softened by 0.125. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Here is the record of the opening transactions for half a day:

### Tianjin Merchants Re-Search for Purchases Cash Price Seen Moving Up Again

Yesterday, the cash silver ingot open market situation continued to rise, because the foreign exchange was suddenly tight and soft under the pulling by North China foreign banks, which caused Tianjin merchants to entrust money changers to relentlessly force their way in. At the same time, the rich in this city and merchants from the north were also secretly active in absorbing purchases. Fortunately, the silver shop merchants, gold shops, and money changers were still willing to supply, so the increase on that day was limited. However, there were still few changes in the middle, and the people's hearts were firm and stable. Trading was similar to the previous day. Silver shop jewelry initially listed at one yuan, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold returned to unchanged levels.

### Silver Ingots Rise Six Yuan

Since the early morning, a certain money changer immediately called out 2,048 yuan to buy one bar of silver (ten taels each). Silver shop merchants were only willing to supply if the price was 50 yuan. At that time, under the pulling of foreign exchanges by foreign banks in Pingjin, the underlying trend was quite tight, so the buyer's intention to enter became stronger. First, a money changer bought 100 taels from silver shop merchants and 50 taels from gold shops, all at the opening price of 2,050 yuan. After the opening, merchants from the north also followed to buy, buying 50 taels from silver shop merchants at a price of 52 yuan. Subsequently, a money changer came to search for purchases again, buying 50 taels from silver shop merchants at a price of 51 yuan, and buying 50 taels each from silver shop merchants and gold shops, all at a price of 50 yuan. Later, at the same price, merchants from the north bought 50 taels from silver shop merchants, and a money changer bought 50 taels of silver coins from silver shop merchants at a price of 52 yuan. Afterwards, after Western merchants sold after the foreign exchange was transmitted by telegram, it showed a slight rebound, and another money changer came out with money on behalf of the clients, so the price fell and sold 100 taels to a money changer at a price of 50 yuan (it is said that the money changer’s purchases were mostly on behalf of Tianjin merchants). Later, the silver shop merchants sold 50 taels to a money changer at a price of 52 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the money changers initially mutually made 50 taels at a price of 52 yuan. After this, the supply and demand suddenly thinned, and the price also became unchanged. Forced to about 3:30 PM, a silver shop suddenly had a buying wind. However, at that time, sellers were extremely scarce, so it raised the price to 54 yuan, and a silver shop bought 50 taels from a money changer. Although a silver shop continued to have buying intentions, sellers became even more difficult to find, so no transactions were made, so the evening closing was still 2,054 yuan, which was six yuan higher compared to the previous day (a difference of four yuan throughout the day). The cash gold shop's own brand gold sold at 2,060 yuan and bought back at 2,045 yuan. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and no transactions were made.

### Jewelry Listed Up One Yuan

The price of jewelry per tael was initially opened in the morning, and in view of the steady underlying trend of silver ingots, the price was listed up one yuan. Da Tong Hang and Lao Qingyun changed to 208 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang also changed to 206 yuan, buying back at 200 yuan.

### Pure Gold Remained Unchanged

The London telegram of the 10th stated that the price of English pure gold per ounce had not changed, remaining at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 3.5 pence, so the Central Bank's Chinese cash purchase price also remained unchanged at 1,210 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold was unchanged, remaining at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged, still calculated at 1,205 yuan and 9 jiao.

### Most Foreign Currencies Increased

Yesterday, the price of English pure gold did not move, and the exchange rate of the English dollar decreased by 0.25. Foreign exchange settlements were slightly active, and the banks' supply was not smooth. The market price was soft in the middle. Later, Hong Kong Electric slightly dumped, and the firms' willingness to sell was still refreshing. The market price returned to level, with no honor or disgrace compared to the previous night. There is no market on Saturday afternoon. The opening of silver ingots was still level. Later, retail investors gradually began to absorb, and Tianjin merchants made slight purchases. The supply from gold shops and money changers was not much, and the chips were slightly lacking. The market price was high. Afternoon transactions were rare, and the trend was tight. Because the foreign currency bills were once soft, and the silver ingots were firm, the rich made slight absorptions, and the market price rose slightly. Door-to-door transactions were still prosperous, and the association's transactions were not opened. Yesterday's market prices were: English gold bills up 8 fen, American surplus bills up 0.5 fen, Hong Kong bills up 0.02 yuan, French franc bills up 0.005 yuan, Canadian bills up 6.5 fen, Italian lira down 0.02 yuan, and most other currencies remained unchanged.

### Discount Rates Remained Stable

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange draft bills once rose, but it returned to level immediately after rising. Per thousand yuan, it once rose from 35 yuan to 35.5 yuan, but it soon returned to level, and finally the price was 25 yuan, which was the same as the previous day.

### T/T Near and Long Term Returned Downwards Indian Silver Spot Long Term Contracted

The London telegram of the 10th stated that speculators sold, and the market was level. After the closing, it was still level. The silver large T/T near term contracted by 0.0625, and the long term also contracted by 0.125. The New York silver telegram stated that the American silver price remained unchanged. The Bombay silver telegram stated that Indian silver had differences. The spot returned long by 1 anna, the near term continued to fall by 1 anna, and the long term fell by 2 annas.

### Securities Hainan Affects Maritime Bond Market

Only Two Days of Trading Left

The securities open market trend suddenly changed again yesterday. The bond market, due to the alarm that the Japanese army actually landed on Hainan Island, this move posed a great threat to the colonies of countries such as Britain and France. At the same time, China's international transportation lines also felt a great crisis, which had to be considered of great significance. Whether this move was deliberately threatening to force the countries concerned to use forceful mediation of the Sino-Japanese issue, in order to fulfill their original intention of seeking peace, and whether the countries were subject to its restraint and willing to act as puppets, or whether retaliatory actions would occur, was unknown. However, public bonds had been unexpectedly hit, and they had declined after tending to rise in one go. This matter was of great importance, and the future development was unpredictable. In the midst of this crisis of suspicion and shock, the fluctuations in public bonds were bound to be greater than before.

The process of yesterday was that the initial opening seemed to be stable, because Yongkang and Xinfeng still had buying. Suddenly, Xie Dahao had too many sales, and the shaking and unstable hearts of the people suddenly caused a storm of falling prices. Tongkanghao and retail investors also tended to sell, and the price became more and more unsustainable. Because Category A happened to be after the lottery draw, most of those who failed to be lucky wanted to sell, so it fell sharply by more than one yuan in half a day, and the other types also fell by a small amount of 0.5-0.6 yuan. In the afternoon, Xie Da continued to sell, and the number was also large. Only Tiansheng and Yongkanghao slightly bought in the market, and retail investors entered more and sold less. The market price continued to weaken. However, because Category B had a continuous lottery relationship, there were more eating households, and the initial meeting was slightly stronger, and finally fell due to excessive supply. After this major blow to the market price, the hearts of the people were scattered and suspicious, and it was not easy to raise their heads for a while. Tracing the results of the market price, there was a uniform decline, ranging from a small amount of 0.65 yuan to 1.25 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated at 800,000-900,000 yuan. There were no transactions for 96. Fortunately, the bond market only had two more days of business, and the changes should not be huge. The brief table is listed below:

In stock trading, there was a transaction of 100 shares of Great China Match Company stock, at a price of 12.6 yuan. There were no other transactions.

The listed market prices of London Chinese foreign bonds on the 10th of this month (Friday) have stabilized, and the English gold clearing bond issued by the English bond actually contracted by 0.5 pound, with a price of 48.5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged. In the London physical market supply and demand, the buyer offered 3,000 pounds for the English gold clearing bond issued by the English bond, at a price of 48 pounds and 5 shillings, which was slightly reduced by 5 shillings. The seller had 1,000 pounds of Huguang Railway German bond with printed bonds, at a selling price of 19 pounds and 15 shillings, which was reduced by 5 shillings. There was also 1,600 pounds of Guangjiu Railway bond, at a selling price of 18.5 pounds, which was reduced by 1.5 pounds. There were also 2,000 pounds of Sino-French US 5% bond (ie, US 10,000), at a selling price of 69 pounds and 5 shillings, which was raised by 1.5 pounds. Although the current market price has been raised, the foundation is still not solid.

The listed market prices of stocks of London British Far East companies on the 10th of this month (Friday) show that bank stocks have risen again. Chartered Bank stock continued to rise by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of 9 pounds and 15 shillings. HSBC English-registered stock rose by 1 pound, with a price of 82.5 pounds, and Hong Kong-registered stock rose by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 85 pounds. Korean mining stock shrank by 6 pence, with a price of 6 shillings and 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn Jardine Matheson Japanese Invasion of Hainan Concerns Jardine Matheson's Sale of South China

Profits and More Competing to Sell the Market Price Fell Three or Four Yuan

The yarn market is showing weakness, with the daily decline being more intense. Sales to customers are exceptionally quiet, and all merchants have no signs of activity. In fact, there are not many days left in the year, and the number of ships in operation will also be suspended for several days, with only one or two flights determined. As a result, the actual need has been reduced. At the same time, some people, due to the Japanese army landing on Hainan Island, are concerned that it will affect the sale of yarn to South China in the future. Generally, those who can make a slight profit are suddenly competing to sell, but although the number of shares has not surged, at the end of this period, it has already been heavily mortgaged, and acceptance is lacking. The market price is falling step by step, and transactions that can be made among counterparts are even rarer. As for the hoarding households, they have been dragging in continuously for several days, and the amount is huge. For the time being, they have no intention of doing anything, and a certain cotton company is selling every day in the market, cutting off most of the shares to prepare for closing accounts. As a result, the table has become looser.

### Actual Sales Only One Hundred and More Bales

In the current situation of yarn, the initial opening in the early morning was still peaceful, but the counterparts gathered and talked empty words, because the actual appetite of the customer merchants was sluggish, and most of them had no telegrams to handle the goods, so there was no transaction. The opening price of 20 double horses was unchanged, and 15 bales were sold, at a price of 400 yuan. After a while, the counterparts and retail investors, in view of the cold business and the tense situation on Hainan Island, suddenly had crowded sellers, and the market fell step by step, and the popularity turned weak. Finally, the price of 20 double horses was done at 397.5 yuan, and the minimum price of the warehouse receipt was 393.5 yuan. As a result, the total transaction volume in the morning was only 462 bales. The selling price of 20 double horses yarn fell by two yuan compared to the previous day, and the special Jincheng fell by four yuan, the double Earth fell by four yuan, and the Tiannv fell by two yuan. No transactions were made for ten coarse yarns, and the factory did not open either. Today, 25 pieces of yarn were shipped to Fuzhou, 140 pieces were shipped to Shantou, 20 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 370 pieces were shipped to Haiphong. Here is a list of the amount bought by each merchant:

Counterparts 340 Wenzhou 30

Fujian 30 Hong Kong 20

Ningbo 3 Shantou 20

Yunnan 2 Statistics 463

### Japanese Yarn Makes People Unable to Enter or Exit

The Japanese yarn market situation remains sluggish as before. The needs of all parties have completely entered a state of standstill. Therefore, the market price has not made much progress or retreat and is similar to the previous day. The current yarn price of 20 Shuiyue is 326 yuan, and the current yarn price of 20 Lanfeng is 321-322 yuan, it is said.

### American Cotton Weekend Statistics

The New York telegram stated that the American cotton statistics from August 1, last year to February 10 this year are listed on the left,

Since August 1, worldwide use of American cotton 6,253,000

### Haiphong Transportation May Be Threatened Raw Cotton Factory Handling is Even More Apathetic

The foreign cotton market price, New York American cotton opened firmly in the early morning, because a part of short selling hedging rose, and counterparts also had slight transactions. Congressman Smith recently suggested that the government extract 1.5 million bales of American cotton from the loan cotton project every year to compensate those who voluntarily reduce cotton fields again. However, although this proposal was opposed by the public, the government promised to consider it again and decided to respond in the next session. Yesterday, the recent period of New York rose by 2 pounds of sound, the long term fell by 2 pounds of sound, India fell by 0.5 rupee, and Egypt rose by 3.5 pounds of sound. Yesterday, the exchange rate was quite tired, and the legal currency was converted, and the cotton price rose instead. It is estimated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 0.5 yuan per picul, Indian cotton rose by 0.7 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 1 yuan.

The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction is very quiet. Since the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, the general textile industry is deeply afraid that the Haiphong transportation will be threatened. A part of the cotton yarn hoarding households are considering that the red plate price will be difficult to develop. As a result, various yarn factories are even more apathetic about purchasing foreign cotton, so there will be no huge transactions within the year. Here is a record of yesterday's cotton prices:

The local cotton business is still bleak, and only counterparts buy it as a decoration. The factory's ability to be difficult to implement, and the market price is also not exciting. The source of northern Jiangsu is even more diminished. It is estimated that 687 bales of Tongzhou cotton and 110 pieces of Beisha are coming. Here is a record of the current cotton transaction situation:

### Grain It is rumored that a certain party is buying wheat in the market

The highest reaches 6.9 yuan But this statement is difficult to verify

Yesterday, the wheat market was as firm as before. From the factory transaction, since the foreign wheat order arrived in Shanghai, there has been no enthusiastic removal, and most of the holders also plan to wait until next year to sell it, so they insist on not relaxing. It is also heard that although the various flour factories have not had a large turnover recently, a certain flour factory in Zhabei is still buying raw materials, so the market is firm. The open transaction in the unified market has no transaction of only one package, and the rumor that a certain party has purchased wheat at the highest price of 6.9 yuan, but this kind of rumor may be difficult to verify, it is said.

### Powder Shipped to Tianjin for Ten Thousand Packages The Market is Also Ending

Yesterday, the powder market still had few changes, but the general situation was no longer as firm as in the previous two days, because the Lunar New Year is approaching, and both buyers and sellers lack enjoyment. The retail sales to both the north and south merchants are still not bad, but there has been no large transaction, so the market is showing signs of ending. The total transaction volume of the city is less than 20,000 packages. In addition to 7,000-8,000 packages of scattered batches in this street, the Cantonese, Fujian, Hebei, and Shandong merchants only jointly handled more than 10,000 packages. The price of No. 2 flour factory is still 4.8 yuan. At a time when the current flour of various factories is lacking, the market can still be stable.

Today, 10,500 packages of flour will be shipped to Tianjin, 4,000 packages will be shipped to Shantou, and 7,000 packages will be shipped to Fuzhou.

### Customer Xian Turned Active in the Afternoon

Du Rice Had Many Discounted Share Sales

The Customer Xian Market yesterday fell at the same time as the local sharp, with prices ranging from a few cents to the outside of the corner. Because the floating vendors and retail investors mainly ended their year, the morning selling was extremely strong, and the market was quite depressed, with only 700-800 packages sold at low prices. However, in the afternoon, because the price was low, the store attracted factories along the road and opened more than 2,000 packages. Although the market situation has not been reversed, the market atmosphere is no longer as sluggish as in the morning. There were 1,000 packages from the east of Hupu yesterday.

The Du Rice market is ending on the 14th, with only two days of trading left. The situation has shown a decline. The sources from all roads are scarce, and only No. 5 of Hexia has arrived, with more than 1,000 packages of cart steamed buns, and the sales in this street lack a large appetite, so those who have a lot of goods in hand only plan to get rid of them quickly, and the price reduction is quite chaotic. As a result, the prices of the various goods have fallen again, and the transactions are ultimately limited. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice have depreciated by a few cents to 1-2 corners, and the prices of Du Yangjian and Bu Jian have also continued to fall by about a corner. Only Bian Yuan, because of the scarcity of goods and delicious taste, is still stable.

### Metals White Lead Skin Turns Easy To Old Appearance Battery Factory Handling Suddenly Dense

The white lead skin market, which has been quiet for a long time, changed its old appearance yesterday because the battery factory was handling it. For example, the inventory of colors No. 5 and 6 has almost been exhausted by the city, and the market price has suddenly risen by more than 10 yuan. The highest price of No. 5 is 220 yuan per barrel, and No. 6 is sold for 208 yuan. However, there are still many people searching for handling, but the new goods are not followed up, and the bottom storage is exhausted, and there is a worry of out of stock in the coming days. Other colors are relatively quiet because the battery factory's intentions are lighter, and customers are waiting and seeing, but the market price is also brought up by 1-2 yuan, such as No. 2 sold for 226 yuan per barrel, No. 3 sold for 222 yuan per barrel, No. 4 sold for 220 yuan, and Nos. 7 and 8 sold for 300 yuan. The inventory of No. 9 is thinner, so the selling price is 235 yuan. No. 10 is even more scarce for circulating goods, so the opening price is outside of 240 yuan, and other thick colors have even less inventory, so the opening price is about 250 yuan. It is estimated that the overseas price is about 25 pounds per ton, and the cost is about 250-260 yuan according to the exchange rate, so the counterparts dare not purchase it, it is said.

### Oil Cakes
Amidst the Sound of New Year Drums, Another Batch of Futures Opens for Bean Cakes

Yesterday, a total of 12,000 pieces were transacted, all handled by the Quanzhou merchants.

Due to the continuous imbalance between supply and demand for bean cakes, they have long maintained a superior position with more gains than losses. Yesterday, the Quanzhou merchants suddenly inquired about futures trading as the year-end approached, suggesting that future potential remains strong. Yesterday afternoon, Changzhou Xie Feng Factory's "Yuan Long" brand was opened for 7,000 pieces, with delivery scheduled for the first half of March, priced at $3.17. By closing time, Pu Li Factory's "Fei" brand was also opened for 5,000 pieces, priced at $3.19. Therefore, the "Yuan Long" brand was not opened further due to tight demand. Currently, 1,000 pieces of "Yuan Long" brand cakes were transacted, with the price only at $3.11 due to inferior color, also handled by the Quanzhou merchants.

Yesterday, 2,200 cases of crude oil arrived from Qingdao, and today, 250 cases are being shipped to Fuzhou.

In terms of miscellaneous grains, 250 cases of peanuts arrived from Qingdao yesterday. Today, 900 bags of soybeans and 400 bags of raw kernels are being exported to Shantou, and 450 bags of split soybeans are being shipped to Fuzhou.

### Sugar Market
Taikoo Sugar

Transported from Xiamen after Duty Payment

Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's trading board showed little fluctuation. Spot goods of Dutch No. 24 coarse white were priced at $24.15 at the outer warehouse and $24.30 at the local warehouse. Re-exported goods were priced at $16.20. Dutch red sugar was priced at $16.70 at the local warehouse and $11 for re-exports. According to the Joint Operating Office's inventory, there are still 32,000 bags of Dutch red sugar and 11,000 bags of Taikoo "H" mark red sugar. The Taikoo white sugar market was also flat. "B" mark goods at the western warehouse were priced at $24, "CW" mark at $23.90, "CX" mark at $23.80, "DY" mark at $23.70, and "HX" mark at $23.60. Arrivals included 2,950 bags of Taikoo white sugar, 10 bags of Taikoo "H" mark red sugar, and 1,000 bags of Taikoo ice "CC" mark, imported by the Jia Ying Wheel. It is said that these were re-exported from Xiamen after duty payment. If so, the previous rumor about duty payment in Xiamen has been confirmed. The forward delivery of Taikoo sugar, opened the day before yesterday, involved 11,000 bags ready for shipment, priced at HK$9.25 to HK$8.885.

### Textiles
Textiles Quietly Await the New Year Market

Export Goods Are Still Lively

Due to the consistent efforts of local merchants to prepare for year-end closures, the market is unusually quiet. Only scattered purchases are being made by merchants, and prices from various goods factories are high. Wholesale prices are also firm. The asking price for white cloth is slightly up by five cents per bolt, while colored cloth is flat. Various factories are quietly awaiting the spring sales of bleached cloth, poplin, ramie yarn, and foreign yarn, and are raising prices, unwilling to compromise. Merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Fujian are still placing many orders, all to be shipped within the year. Order deliveries in this street remain lively, but the number of new purchases is very small, nearing the end.

The eastern cloth trade is gradually quieting down. Local businesses in this street saw only small transactions yesterday. Large-scale wholesale merchants transferring funds to warehouses have mostly settled their accounts. However, because hoarding continues for white cloth, prices continue to rise. The market price for "Ten Good Pounds Rainbow Ball" is up by ten cents per bolt, selling for $12.15. Fine twill is relatively stable. There is little change in "Dragon Head" and "Yang Crane" compared to the previous day's market, likely because selling prices for colored twill have not increased, and dyeing factories are showing little interest. The foreign firm's forward price for "Dragon Head" fine twill is $12, with a counteroffer of $11.80 not accepted. The gap with spot goods is widening, and no transactions have been made.

Today, 480 pieces are being shipped to Tianjin, 110 pieces to Yantai, 60 pieces to Fuzhou, 680 pieces to Shantou, 10 pieces to Hong Kong, and 170 pieces to Haiphong.

### Silk and Tea
Silk Transactions with Foreign Firms Are

Difficult to Approach

Both Chinese and foreign silk prices are reported to be firm. Yesterday, the New York exchange opened with prices rising again by one or two points, further strengthening the market in this port. Factories remain optimistic and firmly hold their positions, making transactions with foreign firms difficult to approach. As for Indian firms' sales, they became sparse yesterday, likely because the price of native silk has risen to a high level, and continuous large-scale purchases over the past few days seem to have satisfied demand. Therefore, yesterday's transactions were somewhat less active, with a total of 12 bales of medium-to-upper-grade Zhili silk transacted, with selling prices increasing by more than $5 per bale.

### Dried and Preserved Goods
High-Quality Sun-Dried Meat Rises by About $3

A dozen or so pieces of top-quality sun-dried longan meat arrived the day before yesterday. Samples were seen yesterday, and both quality and color were excellent. Because the cost was very high, the original price was not readily lowered. After negotiations, a deal was quickly reached, with prices rising by about $3 compared to before, but the sales price in the market was lower, with a difference of $2.

### Seafood
Ten Pieces of Chaozhou Golden Hook Shrimp Sold

Recently, a batch of Chaozhou Jieshi golden hook shrimp tails was opened by a Chaozhou firm for ten pieces yesterday. The color of the goods was still good, but some were slightly soft. The asking price was $83 per picul (cash). Yesterday, the Jia Ying Wheel imported 172 pieces of sea cucumber and 6 pieces of shark fin, transshipped from Hong Kong.

### Letters to the Editor
Answering Mr. Song of Huangqiao Jiali Town Regarding Inquiry about Small Flour Milling Machines

Dear Sir, I read in your newspaper on January 24th that Mr. Song of Huangqiao inquired about small flour milling machines. Inquiries to various foreign firms in Shanghai will naturally not be satisfactory. After I returned to China from studying in Europe, I found that the most suitable small flour milling machines are the English and German types.

The English type includes the following machines: a wheat sifter, a wheat brushing machine, a pair of vertical stone grinding discs, and two silk flour sifters, powered by a 5-horsepower belt. It can produce 300 catties of wheat per hour, yielding 200 catties of flour, with a price of about $4,000 to $5,000 for the complete set. If a smaller size is needed, it can be powered by a 1-horsepower motor, producing 40 pounds of flour per hour (without wheat cleaning), priced at about $1,200.

The German type machine is as follows: It can process one shi dan (110 pounds) of wheat per hour, requiring 7 horsepower. It includes a wheat sifter, a wheat cleaning machine, a dust removal machine, a small magnet, a double roller mill (stone rollers are better than steel rollers because they don't generate heat), a pair of silk flat sifters, connected to a 7-foot square sifter box and an iron frame, priced at $1,600 to $2,400 in national currency. Flour produced by traditional stone mills, using damp wheat, cannot be stored for long; it will become moldy within a month at most, and the bran will ferment and become smelly within three to five days. This type of machine processes entirely dry wheat, which is its first advantage. Large flour mills use silk flat sifters, so the flour produced is fine. A No. 9 silk sifter produces No. 2 flour, the same as this machine. Traditional methods use bamboo sieves with larger openings, no better than No. 5 or No. 6 (i.e., 60 openings), so the flour is not separated from the bran. Also, because of the flat stone mill, the wheat is not evenly distributed, and the stone pieces rub against each other, grinding down sand that mixes into the flour, causing a gritty sound.

In the new-style small flour mills around Wuxi, there are no fewer than a hundred, only using electric power to drive flat stone mills, with an addition of an Archimedes screw and steel sieves, which are not exemplary.

It is important to know that small mills do not have double or multiple grinding, so the flour produced is not as well-separated into No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, and bran as in large mills. Even large Chinese mills do not produce No. 1 flour and have no flour-beating machines, so the flour yield cannot match that of large mills. Large mills have a yield of 72%, while small mills have a yield of 70%. The flour produced initially is white, with a yield of 55%, and the flour produced later (slightly) has some bran, but this method is already far better than current practices.

Now, what I would like to ask is: Which province and county does Huangqiao belong to? (Note: Huangqiao Jiali Town belongs to Rugao County, Jiangsu Province.) How much capital is Mr. Song willing to invest? How many bags of flour does he want to produce? What is the local price of wheat (per 100 catties)? What is the local price of foreign flour, i.e., the flour from large mills, and whose brand is it? What is the price of local flour? Is there a market for bran in my hometown? The income from bran should not be underestimated. If Mr. Song of Huangqiao is truly interested, I can provide a budget and design, arrange everything until the flour is produced, and provide flour bags. Please decide on the machine quickly, and after installation and testing, flour can be produced in two and a half months, just in time. We can discuss the compensation after you are satisfied. After flour production, I must go elsewhere, but I can teach someone to manage it. I am currently installing a German-style small flour mill in Zhou Tie Qiao Xia Zhu Street, Yixing. A small boat comes from Wuxi. Please forward to Mr. Zhu Haoyuan of the German-Asian Company at No. 226 Qiqi Road, French Concession, or Zhu Dingzhi, No. 13 Ping An Lane, Pushi Road.

Ed Loverich, 6 feet 1 and a half inches tall, 205 pounds, reserve forward of the US Olympic team in 1936. He is the one who scored the most points on this expedition to the Far East, and is one of the best forwards rarely seen on the Pacific coast.

Jack Gannon, 6 feet tall, 160 pounds, scored the most points when he was in school, and is a sharp forward for the team. Bon Egge, 6 feet tall, 170 pounds, has been selected as a member of the West Coast representative team and the Northern representative team, and serves as a guard. He has great confidence in grabbing rebounds.

Dick Egge, 6 feet tall, 165 pounds, is the brother of B Egge and serves as a forward. He and his brother are both outstanding talents.

Jack Hanover, 5 feet 11 inches tall, is one of the smallest members of the team, weighing 175 pounds. He has been selected as a member of the Northern representative team.

Ralph Cairney, Manager, 6 feet tall, 180 pounds, has been repeatedly selected as a member of the West Coast representative team in 1931 and 1932, and serves as a guard.

### Tan Fuzhen and Zhang Xueyao

Educational News

### Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi Provinces Promote Agricultural and Industrial Vocational Education Plans (Part 1)

Divide the nine provinces into three regions and complete them within three years.

(Chongqing Newsletter) The plan to promote agricultural and industrial vocational education in the nine provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi was previously resolved, revised and approved by the Central Construction and Education Committee, and is now being ordered by the Ministry of Education. The common principles, the current situation in each region, and the future improvement plans are recorded below.

Principles: Each province's promotion of agricultural and industrial vocational education is divided into three regions for implementation: (A) Northwest Region, including the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai; (B) Sichuan-Kang Region, including the two provinces of Sichuan and Xikang; (C) Southwest Region, including the three provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan and Guangxi. Each region shall establish one or several national agricultural and industrial colleges, in conjunction with the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, the Central Industrial Experimental Institute, and the regional agricultural improvement institute, to be fully responsible for promoting and guiding agricultural and industrial education and technology within the region. Each province in each region shall, with reference to the province's agricultural and industrial occupations and raw material distribution, stipulate the locations and subjects for the establishment of senior and junior agricultural and industrial vocational schools. If necessary, factories or farms can be established first for the facilities of vocational schools, and a small number of apprentices can be trained according to their needs, and gradually expanded into graduation schools or training institutes. All teaching, practice, and improvement matters related to senior and junior vocational schools shall be planned and guided by the Provincial Department of Education in conjunction with the regional agricultural and industrial colleges, as well as agricultural and industrial experimental and improvement agencies. Economic and construction agencies in each region shall, within the possible scope, plan various small factories or farms in accordance with local needs, closely cooperate with the local vocational schools, and recruit apprentices for training in the factories and farms. Agricultural and industrial construction and education cooperation matters in each region shall be promoted by the president of the agricultural and industrial college, jointly with the directors of the provincial departments of education and construction, and the chiefs of the relevant departments, and the directors of agricultural and industrial experimental and improvement agencies. The implementation plan for each region shall be completed within three years.

Northwest Region: "Current Situation" It is found that the region has established the National Northwest Institute of Technology and the National Northwest Agricultural College, which can assume the responsibility of guiding agricultural and industrial education and technology in the region. However, the vocational schools in each province are not very developed. Shaanxi Province has 4 industrial schools and 3 agricultural schools. Gansu Province has 2 industrial schools and 1 agricultural school. Ningxia Province has 1 junior vocational training institute. Qinghai Province has 1 agricultural school and 1 industrial school. "Improvement Plan" The region is inconvenienced by transportation, and industrial production is extremely backward. Even in agriculture, it sticks to old methods and does not know how to improve. It is now planned to establish one senior agricultural and industrial vocational school each in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces in addition to reorganizing the existing schools. The industrial school will offer four courses: mechanical engineering, civil engineering, textile engineering, and applied chemistry. The agricultural school will offer three courses: agronomy, animal husbandry, and forestry. In addition, junior vocational schools or training courses in various subjects will be planned at appropriate locations.

Four schools in each province. In Ningxia and Qinghai provinces, in addition to reorganizing the existing schools, one senior industrial and agricultural vocational school each will be established. The agricultural school will offer three courses: agronomy, animal husbandry, and forestry. The industrial school will offer courses in mechanical engineering and applied chemistry. Junior practical vocational schools will be planned in each county, two in each province. The locations and all plans for the establishment of the above-mentioned schools in each province shall be formulated in detail by the provincial departments of education and construction, in conjunction with the National Northwest Agricultural and Industrial College, and agricultural improvement agencies, in accordance with local conditions, and submitted to the ministry for approval.

School Overview

### Da Gong Vocational School

Da Gong Vocational School was founded by Mr. Lin Meiyan. It adheres to the principles of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China, implements production education, imparts vocational skills, and fosters values such as propriety, knowledge, righteousness, patriotism, and community spirit. It was established in June of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). A plot of over 40 mu was purchased on Jumen Road to construct spacious school buildings, practical workshops, banks, shops, and physics and chemistry laboratories. In May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), it was approved for registration by the Education Bureau. In August of the same year, the new buildings were fully completed, with departments for senior and junior high school, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, commerce, general studies, and other ordinary subjects. The student population has reached over a thousand. The management and teaching are earnest, and the facilities are excellent, earning widespread praise from people both domestically and abroad. In the spring of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), it received a subsidy of 15,000 yuan from the Ministry of Education to enhance the equipment in each department, further improving its scale and completeness. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Incident in the 26th year of the Republic (1937), a portion of the school relocated to Chongqing, establishing a branch school. Over 400 mu of land were acquired in Xiaolongkan, in the northwest corner of Chongqing, to build school buildings and establish factories. In August of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), it enrolled five or six hundred students, with classes officially beginning in mid-October. The Shanghai school was then moved to Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Due to the impact of the war, it experienced some decline. In August of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), it relocated again to Jiangxi Road in the International Settlement, striving to expand and reorganize. The student population increased to around 500, and the existing school buildings became insufficient. It has now moved to Qingyun Building at 131 Hankou Road. Shi Duhui has been appointed as the vice-principal and head of the commerce department, Chen Xiyuan as the director of academic affairs and head of the mechanical engineering department, Xu Chao as the director of student affairs and head of the general studies department, and Yuan Zemeng as the head of the civil engineering department. The faculty in each department are all university graduates with profound academic knowledge and rich experience. Since its inception, six years ago, students have graduated three times. Graduates from the general studies department mostly pursue further education, while graduates from the vocational departments mostly work in factories, banks, and railways.

### School News

Min Guang Middle School: Min Guang Middle School, located at 2 Yuyuan Road, Jiaozhou Road intersection, is known for its earnest dedication to education and outstanding academic results. Therefore, the school adopts strict assessments of students' academic performance and conduct, with clear rewards and punishments. Each semester, a significant number of students are held back or dismissed due to poor academic performance or conduct. However, for students with excellent conduct and academic performance, in addition to receiving certificates of merit, there are also scholarship provisions. It is understood that students ranked first in academic performance and conduct in each grade receive free tuition, those ranked second receive a silver shield, and those ranked third receive a certificate of merit. Furthermore, one student with the best academic performance is selected from both the senior and junior high school departments to receive a full tuition waiver as encouragement.

Shi Cheng Middle School: Since Mr. Xing Pengju took office as the principal of Private Shi Cheng Middle School, he has worked diligently. On January 15th, the school received Instruction No. 286 from the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Education stationed in Shanghai, approving the school's application for establishment and the registration of the board of directors. The school is now actively expanding and has allocated a substantial sum of money to construct a new four-story building on the vacant land of the current school site for use as dormitories, a library, and a physics and chemistry laboratory.

Two weeks of vacation have quietly slipped away. Now it is the beginning of a new semester, and the children are going back to school with their schoolbags, resuming their school life.

Children! In your studies at school, do not be arrogant because you are talented and neglect your studies; nor be discouraged because you are dull. Those who are willing to study hard are the ones who will win in the end. The saying "Fear not slow, fear only stop!" means just that.

The story of "The Tortoise and the Hare" is one that everyone has heard. Although the tortoise crawls slowly, it is able to persevere and keep moving forward, so it wins. Although the hare runs very fast, it thinks it runs well and is unwilling to work hard, dozing off midway, and as a result, it fails.

This is a good lesson for us: Smart children, quickly use the hare as a warning. Intelligence is not reliable. If you rely on your intelligence and do not know how to work hard, you will inevitably fail. Dull children, encourage yourselves with the tortoise. Dullness is not a problem, as long as you are willing to work hard continuously, you may succeed in the end.

Historically, there have been many ancient people with slow aptitudes who, because of their determination to study diligently, without fear of difficulties or discouragement, ultimately achieved astonishing things. But there are also countless geniuses who are unwilling to work hard and stop halfway, so they remain unknown.

Respectable children! Keep in mind: "Fear not slow, fear only stop!" Strive for your future, and do not stop your progress. The destination is approaching you!

### The Clock and Galileo

— Third Brother

The clock—it tells us when to get up, tells us when to go to school, it also tells us when to go to bed. We cannot leave it for a day, we cannot but listen to its command for a moment. How useful it is to us! Since it is so closely useful to us, we cannot not know how it was produced and the interesting story of its father.

Galileo was an Italian scientist, born in 1564 and died in 1642. His contributions to the scientific community in his lifetime are countless.

One day, he was attending mass in the Pisa Cathedral. He looked up and saw a small lamp hanging on the wall, swaying back and forth incessantly. Out of curiosity, he stared blankly at it, continuing to stare until everyone had finished mass and gone home. He still stood foolishly under the wall, looking at it incessantly, and from time to time pressing his own pulse with his hand, counting numbers like "one, two, three, four" in his mouth. The officiating priest thought he had gone mad and wanted to chase him out, but he suddenly laughed and ran home as if flying.

On the road, he said with a grin, "Got it, got it!" The priest was startled by him.

A few days later, he made a device and published an article. This device is the ancestor of all clocks today. The device is very simple, exactly the same principle as the lamp in the cathedral. His article said: "When I found that the clock swung left and right once, my pulse beat twice, I decided that the time of the swing is constant. Great, we will have a tool to calculate time in the future."

Of course, Galileo's clock is not as accurate and beautiful as the ones hanging on the walls and desks in the children's homes, but if he had not noticed that small lamp at the time, then perhaps we would still not have a tool to calculate time.

### How to Speak

— Wan

Words represent people's thoughts. To understand the temperament of a new friend you have never met, you mostly inquire from their speech. If they speak humorously, you know they are an interesting person; if they speak passively and without energy, you know they are pessimistic; if they speak crudely, you know they have not received education. In short, a person's character and talent are mostly revealed in their speech. At the same time, speaking is to people. Because it is to people, sometimes it makes people smile, sometimes it makes people's eyes crack, sometimes it makes people laugh and cry. Speaking can really make people's faces change unpredictably. Therefore, speaking is both an expression of one's personality and a way to establish relationships with others. Children must pay attention to the following points:

First, do not criticize people—people inevitably have faults, and everyone may not be without faults themselves. However, people often cannot see their own faults, but only judge the faults of others. Such people are too narrow-minded, and their own faults will never be repented. I hope that children will first correct their own mistakes, and then, in addition to not criticizing people behind their backs, have the courage to advise them to their faces.

Second, be honest—Some children often take deceiving as a pleasure, to the point of becoming a bad habit. It leaves a bad impression in people's minds, so that even true words will not be believed by others. Therefore, children suffering from this problem, please reform immediately. The way to reform is to be very honest in telling teachers or parents about things that have been done wrong. You may be punished at the time, but they will change their attitude toward your words.

Third, be consistent in word and deed—That is, be able to do what you say. The general problem of Chinese people is that they can say it, but they cannot do it. These people are nothing more than considering the success or failure of the cause, and not having the determination. In fact, the success or failure of the cause lies in the key of doing it or not doing it.

Fourth, do not gossip—The colloquialism is to move your tongue. Most disputes between people arise because a third party wants to please one side. This kind of situation often happens in schools. I hope that children will not do this kind of uneducated behavior. If there are disagreements between classmates, you should mediate to make them still as friendly as usual. This is your responsibility.

### What Is the Shape of an Iceberg?

— Xinsheng

Children, is your mind constantly speculating?

When you see frozen water surfaces or silvery-white scenes outdoors in cold weather, low temperatures, or heavy snowfall, if your mind is full of ideals, then you will definitely think of the icebergs in the polar and frigid zones! And generate all sorts of imaginary shapes.

What exactly is the shape of an iceberg? Now let me tell you, this may supplement the lack of knowledge you have gained in textbooks.

Ordinary ice floes floating on the ocean can be divided into two major categories, sea ice and land ice, depending on their formation. Icebergs belong to the land ice category. Icebergs are usually mixed with ice floes floating on extremely cold oceans. Their formation is different from sea ice. Greenland and Spitsbergen islands within the Arctic Circle and the Antarctic continent are all places covered with snow all year round. Because of the perennial snowfall, the accumulated snow becomes increasingly dense, and as a result, it turns into ice. This ice naturally has considerable weight, and there is also accumulated ice behind it. Once it is layered on top, pressure is generated, squeezing downward. The ice below is squeezed and slowly slides from high places to the coast along the sloping surface of the land. The speed at which it slides can generally be several meters to dozens of meters per day. When the iceberg reaches the coast, due to the increase in buoyancy of the seawater, or under the impact of huge waves, the entire ice layer is often cut off and scattered, floating on the ocean. This is the origin of icebergs!

The icebergs on the Arctic sea surface are all formed on land. Their shape is not fixed. Because their surface is attached with sand and rocks, they show deep cyan stripes. Their length on the water surface ranges from several meters to several miles, and the height above the water surface ranges from two meters to four hundred and fifty meters, so they can be said to be a very large type of land ice!

The icebergs in Antarctica are not all formed from ice blocks flowing down from valleys, as are the Arctic icebergs. They are all formed on vast ice sheets, so their shape is very flat and wide. The general height is below fifty meters, but their width is extremely wide. Icebergs with a width of one to two thousand meters are often three to four nautical miles, or even fifty to sixty nautical miles long. The most unique feature of Antarctic icebergs is that their tops are flat and broad, looking like ice-frozen dikes from a distance!

The specific gravity of ice is 0.92, and the specific gravity of seawater is 1.027. Therefore, according to the specific gravity calculation, the depth of the part of the iceberg below the water surface should be nine times the height of the part above the water surface, but in reality, the part below the water surface is only six or seven times the part above the water surface. For example, for an iceberg that is one hundred meters high above the water surface, the part below the water surface is probably only six or seven hundred meters deep.

Icebergs drift with the wind on the ocean surface. Under the irradiation of sunlight, the destruction of waves, and the erosion of warm currents, they become various strange shapes. Some look like rows of castles, some look like crouching beasts, and some look like towering mountain peaks, which is extremely spectacular! After drifting for many days, icebergs gradually melt, and the parts above the water surface break off separately, sometimes even emitting a huge sound. When an iceberg collapses, it is very dangerous if a ship passes by it!

Although the scenery of icebergs is majestic and extraordinary, many ships and creatures are destroyed and perish because of them. For example, the British iron steamer Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. From this, we can know that an iceberg is a white, magnificent, and terrifying thing!

### Passing Through the Wharf (Part 1)

— Bai Zheng

Ming'er's Refugee Diary, Number Thirteen

At that time, it was already past eight o'clock in the evening, and the shops on the street had closed their doors. Ming'er and his older brother, Cong'er, were sitting together in a rickshaw, one of more than ten rickshaws heading mightily toward the Jianggan (Riverbank) area. Ming'er felt very strange; why were those shops closing so early and not doing business? He asked his brother, Cong. The rickshaw puller answered instead, "There have been air raid alarms all day long for the past few days. The rich people have already run away. Yesterday there were eleven alarms, making it difficult for us to do business. You are really lucky today; there haven't been any alarms all day long." Ming'er realized that Hangzhou was not the paradise he had imagined.

It took a full hour, passing through who knows how many streets and alleys, twisting and turning, before they arrived at the Guotanghang (Wharf) in Jianggan. The lights on the Qiantang River were reflected on the mirror-like surface of the river, which was truly beautiful. They hurried inside.

The Guotanghang was very large, piled with who knows how many large and small packages of goods. There were many people inside, standing, sitting, old, young, all kinds of people, gathered in one room. When Ming'er and the others walked in, everyone stared at each other, and it suddenly became quiet. They were all refugees with the same fate as Ming'er. Later, they began to talk, and Ming'er listened quietly.

"Where did you come from? Where are you planning to go now?" A young woman, with a yellowish, slightly sorrowful face, showed a slight smile as she asked Ming'er's mother.

"We came from Wuzhen to Hangzhou, which took three days. We are now thinking of going to Tunxi. What about you?" Ming'er's mother replied.

"We came from Jiaxing. We arrived in Hangzhou the day before yesterday, but we couldn't find a boat. We've been staying here for more than a day. We want to go to Lanxi, but it's really hard to find a boat. Even if we offer a good price, it's not easy to find one." She sighed and continued, "Yesterday was really frightening. More than twenty silver-gray airplanes came and dropped dozens of bombs outside Hangzhou City. There was even a bomb that tried to blow up the Qiantang River Iron Bridge, but the bridge wasn't destroyed. Instead, more than ten small boats near the Iron Bridge were sunk. The sound of the explosion shook the ground here. It was so terrible." After the woman finished speaking, the conversation temporarily subsided.

Children's Corner

### The Great Iron

— Lu Dazhi, Grade 5, Guangji Elementary School

Among metals such as gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin, who would have thought that "iron" is the greatest of all metals?

Everyone knows the most common uses of "iron," right? Making all kinds of knives, pots, shovels, scissors. We even eat rice because of iron! Believe it? Let me tell you: Rice is cooked from rice grains, and to cook rice, you need an "iron" pot, right? And rice? It's grown by farmers, and farmers need an iron hoe and an "iron" plow to farm... So isn't eating rice also reliant on "iron"? Furthermore, wearing clothes also relies on "iron." Clothes are sewn from cloth, and sewing cloth requires an "iron" needle, so isn't clothing also reliant on "iron"? By this reasoning, houses and roads are also made possible by "iron"!

Now, the weapons used in wartime are all made of "iron," such as guns, armored vehicles, broadswords, cannons, and airplanes.

In this light, isn't iron more important than gold, silver, copper, tin...? Now that you know the greatness of iron, you can say that the world today is a world of iron.

### School Begins

— Ma Yuanyong, Grade 6, Zhendong Elementary School

The short winter vacation has passed in the blink of an eye. After two weeks apart, we are holding an opening ceremony again. Many children, after being separated for two weeks, can now gather together day and night. We are truly fortunate to be able to receive a proper education in these extraordinary times, to nurture our minds and bodies. Now, education on the isolated island has entered an abnormal state, and parents spend a lot of hard-earned money to send us to school. We should strive to improve ourselves, so that the money our parents have taken out is not wasted. Moreover, the country is in a time of great difficulty, and we are in urgent need of revitalizing the Chinese nation. The responsibility on our shoulders is not light, and we should always cultivate a good foundation, so that we can live up to our country and our parents.

### The Rooster's Crow in the Morning

— Li Lanzhen, Grade 6, Minqi Elementary School

I was sleeping in bed in the morning, when the rooster's crowing woke me up. I got up, opened the window, and saw the beautiful sun just rising from the horizon. Then I washed my face, ate some breakfast, and sat on the sofa to read a few pages of a book. After reading for a while, I went to school, and the time for class hadn't arrived yet.

At this moment, I thought to myself that this small rooster not only gets up early itself, but can also wake us up. How admirable!

But it is always so energetic every day. If we young people cannot invigorate ourselves to do things, then we are not even as good as a rooster.

### New Year Cake

— Gu Yueying, Grade 6, Former Qiming Elementary School

The time is approaching the end of the lunar calendar. Lately, the streets have begun to change into a new look. As soon as you open your eyes, the new embellishment—New Year cake—will surely make you feel sweet in your heart.

But this year, not only can I not feel the sweetness of the past, but it also increases my infinite sadness!

Remembering the matter of eating New Year cake is sweet enough! Every winter vacation, I would return to my hometown with my older brother. My grandmother would always take time out of her busy schedule to make New Year cake. At that time, I would always stand beside her, watching happily. When my grandmother handed me the New Year cake made from the new rice flour of my hometown and I began to chew it happily, the fragrant and sweet taste made me forget everything.

Now? After the fall of my hometown, I can no longer eat the New Year cake! Even the home and school in Zhabei have been destroyed by artillery fire. Who gave this to us? I deeply remember that I don't want to eat the New Year cake on the isolated island now. I want to eat the New Year cake after my hometown is restored.

### Older Brother, Younger Sister——Catching Sparrows

— Made by Han Qing

(1) The older brother and younger sister went out to play together. They saw many sparrows flying and gathering on the tree. The younger sister wanted to catch them, but couldn't.

(2) The older brother built a small house with bricks, topped it with a brick, and put a handful of rice underneath.

(3) The two hid far away, waiting for the sparrows to come down to eat the rice. When they pulled the string, the sparrows were caught.

(4) They were very happy to have caught so many sparrows.

### Snow White (7)

— Grandchild of Heaven

The stubborn old man scolded, "Are you trying to blow away that ghostly thing with those sneezing fits?" Just then, the wealthy man heard a strange sound from upstairs, piercing their ears. It turned out that Snow White had yawned and was beginning to wake up from her sleep.

The doctor, trembling, pointed upstairs, saying, "Over there, in that bedroom, it must be. I think someone should rush upstairs and chase it down."

The little mute's face brightened instantly. He thought it was a great idea and would be good to do. He nodded enthusiastically to show his agreement. However, when he saw all six of his companions staring intently at his face, he stopped nodding.

Poor little mute! Seeing this, he understood perfectly well that the six of them had chosen him to do it. He was a very timid person and was almost scared to pieces. He wanted to find a way to refuse and let someone else do it, but the doctor had already shoved a candle into his trembling hand, leaving him no chance to refuse. Helpless, he had to brace himself and cautiously climbed the stairs, sneaking towards the dark bedroom, his teeth chattering.

He cautiously pushed open the door and peeked in. Unexpectedly, Snow White happened to stretch out her arms and lift the white sheet high, looking like a ghost about to pounce. The little mute was so frightened that his soul flew away. He used all the speed of his little legs, running desperately down the stairs, using various gestures (because he was mute and had never been able to speak) to report to his six companions that the ghost was lying on their bed sleeping. Upon receiving this report, they dared not delay. They gathered their courage, put the hoes on their shoulders, and tiptoed upstairs.

The doctor whispered to his companions, "Get ready, everyone. When I pull off the sheet, strike down with the hoes and kill it!"

The six dwarfs quickly raised their hoes, waiting. The doctor stepped forward and quickly reached out to pull off the sheet.

Suddenly, they all cried out in unison. The seven hoes unknowingly dropped to the ground, and the seven pairs of eyes unknowingly widened, growing wider and wider. The seven mouths unknowingly opened, growing bigger and bigger. These seven dwarfs had lived for hundreds of years and had never seen such a beautiful woman!

Sleepy mumbled, "Doctor, what—what's going on?"

Sneezy exhaled and said, "This is really beautiful!"

Bashful, also lowering his voice, praised softly, "So beautiful—really like a heavenly fairy!"

The stubborn old man sniffed and said, "Humph! As I see it, this is definitely a lot of trouble. I absolutely do not approve."

Happy asked, "Doctor, what exactly is this?"

The doctor stammered, "What, what, I think this is a girl. Yes, definitely, this is a girl."

The dwarfs all asked curiously, "This is a girl? What do we do? She has taken up three of our beds."

The old man grumbled unhappily, "If it's a girl, it would be better if it were a corpse!"

The doctor quickly said, "How can you say that! She won't harm us!"

"Shh, be quiet! She's waking up!"

In the previous two installments of this article, the words "鐵劃" (iron strokes) and "鐵鐘" (iron bell) should be changed to "鋤頭" (hoe).

### The Doctrine of "Reimbursability"

— Lishi

The doctrine of "reimbursability" was very popular in China in the past.

As long as students could read, they could "reimburse" the school authorities, and the school authorities could "reimburse" the students' parents. As for whether reading led to understanding principles, the school authorities and students' families could ignore it.

As long as managers had profitable accounts, they could "reimburse" the board of directors, and the board of directors could "reimburse" the shareholders' meeting. As for the actual business situation, profits were booked even if there were bad debts, and losses were not booked even if they existed. The board of directors and the shareholders' meeting could ignore it.

As long as political workers had work reports, they could "reimburse" their superiors, and their superiors could "reimburse" the government. As for whether the work reports were factual and whether the work progress was appropriate, the superiors and the government were too lazy to inquire.

Because of this, all academics, all businesses, and all politics were stagnant and unable to advance.

However, it must be said that proponents of "reimbursability" also had their unavoidable difficulties. Students used literacy as "reimbursability" to appease their parents' cultivation, managers used false profitable accounts as "reimbursability" to avoid shareholders' accusations, and political workers used grand work reports as "reimbursability" to ward off others' attacks. Therefore, although the doctrine of "reimbursability" hindered all progress in China, it also saved the fate of all those with base intentions.

Our friendly neighbor to the east is remarkably clever. Its history of modernization is a record of absorbing world civilization. Now, as a result of its invasion of China, it has encountered great difficulties and has also adopted the doctrine of "reimbursability."

As a result of the eastern neighbor's nineteen months of war, it has sacrificed 700,000 soldiers and lost 8 billion in its national treasury. It now feels that troop replenishment is difficult, its economy is extremely strained, and its international situation is isolated. Therefore, anti-war sentiment within the country is growing daily, and suicides due to war-weariness are increasing daily. The entire Japanese population is deeply dissatisfied with the current situation. When the Japanese military could not make progress in the war of aggression against China and its political conspiracies were failing, it had no choice but to occupy Hainan Island in order to provide "reimbursability" to its domestic population. Look: Tokyo is loudly boasting that the occupation of Hainan Island, which has no coastal defense, is a "surprise attack." Isn't this deceiving the domestic population and using it for "reimbursability"?

The doctrine of "reimbursability," which is about to die out in the new China that has grown up in the war of resistance, is now having the opportunity to grow in a Japan that is declining and collapsing!

### Unofficial History of the Theater World

— Qu Shigong

Lu Si, with his shaggy hair and thick beard, was unmistakable.

He feared getting haircuts most of all. He said that barbershops were like Western-style detention centers, where he would lose an hour of freedom—freedom of movement—once he stepped inside.

When his hair grew long and his beard grew long, he didn't care. He said that it was in line with "natural beauty."

When it became too long, he would often be forced into the barbershop by his friend M. In fact, he never voluntarily went to get a haircut.

Because of his long hair and beard, many jokes had been made. The biggest was seven or eight years ago when he was still studying at Fudan University. The female students, upon seeing him, would always discuss his age, guessing that he was at least over forty years old. Actually, he hadn't even turned thirty yet.

Enough idle talk, let's talk about two or three of his "twelve embarrassing events."

One night four or five years ago, Lu Si was in the editorial office of the Min Bao when a strange guest suddenly arrived. He rushed in, saying angrily, "Are you planning to return the electric fan you borrowed?"

"What electric fan? I haven't borrowed one," Lu Si replied.

"Are you Mr. Li... (Lu Si)?"

"Yes, my name is Li... (Lu Si); but I haven't borrowed a fan from anyone."

"Yes, you did, last summer."

"Do you know the person with the surname Li...?"

"No, I don't. He asked someone with the surname Zhou to borrow it for you, saying that you were using it to film a movie—'Tear Stains.'"

At this point, Lu Si sighed and realized that he had found the wrong person: it was Lu Shi, with the surname Hou.

In the summer of 1933, the "Era Theater Troupe" participated in the recreational activity of Chizhi University and performed "June 23rd." You Jing played the mother, and Zhang Jianfen played his daughter. Everyone had already put on makeup. In a split second before going on stage, Ms. Zhang suddenly took off her headscarf and said to Lu Si—who was the director of "June 23rd"—"I don't want to perform anymore! Look how dark they made my face with makeup, it's too embarrassing!"

Everyone knew that Lu Si's eloquence was very poor. At this moment, he was so embarrassed that he couldn't say a word. Later, thanks to Yun Jing's persuasion, Lu Si's embarrassment was resolved.

It was also four or five years ago. One morning, he and Ling He watched the "test film" and came out of the Jincheng Grand Theater. Ling He said to him, "Today, I'll treat you to a dinner," so the two walked to a restaurant on Fourth Avenue, ordered a pound of wine, and toasted happily. After finishing the meal, when it was time to pay the bill, Ling He realized that he had forgotten to bring money. At this time, Lu Si only had twenty cents in his pocket, which was, of course, another embarrassment.

Due to space constraints, that's all for now.

### A Glimpse of the Art Exhibition (Difficulties in Moving Remuneration for Donations)

### Mr. Li Gou's Cat

— Ai Li

Mr. Li lives in Huangye Building in Huajing, Shanghai County. The building is located in the northeast of the town and is extremely old, built during the Ming Dynasty. High walls surround it, all planted with creeping fig. Bamboo of filial piety is planted in the courtyard. In spring and summer, the green trees are lush and the winding corridors are quite serene and elegant. The building houses a rich collection of books. When Mr. Li is in the wilderness, he always lives here to write books and study academic subjects. He is addicted to antiques and can hardly part with fragmented and incomplete texts, all of which he treasures. One summer of the Republic of China, the Twenty-Four Histories were suddenly gnawed by mice, and several pages of the History of Liao were lost. He was very saddened by this, so he raised a tabby cat whose colors were mottled like a tiger. Mr. Li loved it very much. Every meal, it would kneel beside the table, eating when given food, and not snatching when not given. From then on, the plague of mice was eradicated. The following year, it gave birth to two cubs, which were larger than ordinary cats. Before the cubs could eat rice, the mother cat suddenly fell ill and died in a few days. Mr. Li actually burst into tears and collapsed afterward. At that time, Mr. Yao Yuan, Mr. Yao Yuan, had two poems for the cat, including the line "Empty expense of two inches of fish for morning meals." Later, the family members took good care of the two cubs. As the cubs grew older, they also depended on their master and stayed close to him, so when he was free from writing, he often used the cats as entertainment. When Mr. Li traveled far to the capital and took charge of Peking University, family reports also inquired about his beloved cats from time to time. These cats are of the fifth generation, and one still remains. Last autumn, during the refuge in Shanghai, he did not bring them with him, and Mr. Li also misses them from time to time. Now it is gone. Mr. Li died worrying about the country. I wonder if these cats can still remember their master.

Mr. Li Gou is Mr. Liu San. Mr. Li was proud and had clean sleeves all his life. Now that Mr. Li has returned to the mountains, his family has almost nothing to rely on. He wants to submit articles to make a living. I think Mr. Li knows the world well. Now, reading the article by his wife, Ai Li, I can't help but feel sad and think of the feelings of plain linen in his life.

Editor's Note

### Elastic Lover

— Rú Huá

"Too Hot to Handle"

A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Production, Shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater

After watching "Elastic Lover", the most regrettable thing is the failure of the screenplay. "Newsreel companies from all over the United States send specialists to capture important news from around the world, competing with each other to obtain exclusive news" is a fact. And the photographers braving fire and water, risking their lives to shoot newsreels, are also a fact. Taking such real material to write a screenplay, as long as a certain motive is seized, the two points mentioned above - that is, the theme - can be developed. Just like the first half of "Elastic Lover", whether expressed in the form of comedy or tragedy, it can be very moving. But after "Gabe obtains the film taken by Hunter in Shanghai, and it is shown at a reception, exposing the matter, and Alma's reputation is suddenly damaged", the screenwriter of this film may have been too eager to win, and in the second half of the film, suddenly started another stove, and released it from a horizontal stabbing. Although he inserted many thrilling scenes, this waist-cut writing destroyed the unity of the whole play, and also destroyed the emotions of the whole play.

The director of this film, Jack Conway, is an expert in directing comedies. At the beginning of the film, the companies compete to shoot newsreels; Bill designs; Alma comes to Shanghai by plane; Hunter risks his life to rescue: he uses short film, the fastest tone, and step by step, to introduce the two most important characters in the film, which is very lovely. In the second half of the film, due to the limitations of the screenplay, he just tried his best on the fragments.

For example, after Alma and Hunter arrived in a small town, they saw a native wearing Harding's (Alma's brother) watch. When Hunter and his assistant went to the voodoo village to visit Harding, Hunter wanted to kill the natives but was escaped by him; the voodoo village's ceremony; - a special screening of the newsreel scared away the natives; Hunter hugged Harding and wanted to leave, but the boat by the river had disappeared. The director used the natives' revelry, music, to accompany Hunter and his assistant's emotions, and the tight editing of the screening of the newsreel and the natives' shock, all showed Jack Conway's superb directing skills.

Also worth mentioning is the photography of this film. Alma piloting the plane, Hunter filming the explosion of the sea ship on the plane, although some of the close-ups can see the model of the flight and the sea ship, but the capture of those medium shots, and when Ai Jianma saved Harding and left the voodoo village by plane. Hunter grabbed the plane and refused to let go, Bill fired a shot, the camera was placed on the right side of the plane, watching the small boat after Tingte let go rushing straight down in the waves, this can not help but make people feel the lack of material conditions in the Chinese photography field.

There is also a section in the film that writes about the war in Shanghai. According to friends, there are scenes of airplane bombing and Hunter's encounter with danger, but after the planes fly by in formation on the screen, it connects to the scene of Hunter taking fake planes. This is probably sacrificed under the scissors of "this time and this place". But from this, it can also be seen that the screenwriter is trying to capture the material as much as possible, and writing "Elastic Lover" into a "mixed vegetable" story.

Clark Gable's Hunter and Mauna Loa's Alma are both working hard, and Ward Connalley, who plays Gabe, is also successful.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 4 Recalling the Past, Happy Heaven Transmits Wonderful Words, Makes New Friends, and Visits Scenic Spots for Pure Pleasure

It is said that the two Miss He sisters took the guest-sending limousine from the inn and arrived at the North Railway Station. The train tickets were bought in advance by the inn, so there was no need to go to the train station to buy them again. The two ladies' luggage was very simple, each with a small suitcase, which contained nothing more than a few personal clothes. They originally came to Shanghai by plane, so naturally they could not bring much luggage on the plane. Even the suitcase was made of lightweight materials, specially for use on airplanes. The train was scheduled to depart at nine o'clock, and they arrived at the station at eight o'clock, and saw that there were many people taking the train. Shuang Yu then said to Li Yu, "Look at so many people taking the train, I'm afraid we won't be able to find Wu Junsu from yesterday." Li Yu said, "If we can't find her, there's nothing we can do. Anyway, when we get to Suzhou, even if she doesn't greet us, we can take care of ourselves." Who knew that they had just arrived on the platform when they heard someone shouting from afar. "Sister He! Why did you only come now!" Looking closely, it was Wu Junsu. It turned out that Wu Junsu had arrived earlier than them. She looked in the carriage and did not see the He sisters. She knew that they must not have arrived yet, so she stood on the platform waiting for them. Now she saw them coming from afar, so she hurriedly greeted them. The current train system is quite different from before the war. First, before the war, the trains were divided into countless levels. There were first-class cars, second-class cars, and third-class cars, but that didn't matter. And below the third-class cars, there were also fourth-class cars, called: Poor people, workers, and small foremen. The person who created the evil fourth-class car may have been out of good intentions, thinking that the price of sitting in a fourth-class car would be much cheaper. Although the facilities and treatment were a little worse, the speed was still the same. But because there were several classes of cars, it seemed that humans were also clearly divided into several classes. With fourth-class cars, it seems that there is a fourth class of people, who should be the fourth class of people? If you want to benefit the general public, can't you just reduce the train fare in general? Often, first-class cars were considered the highest class, but above first-class cars, there were also flower cars. And even there were some government officials, national elders, who specially opened special cars. Now there are no special cars, even if there are important people and important things, wouldn't they take a plane? Flower cars, that kind of aristocratic train, are also rare, unless it is for entertaining foreign guests, funded by the government, and a section is chartered. For example, when ambassadors from various countries come to the National Government to meet the chairman and present their credentials, they bring many counselors and secretaries, etc., so the National Diplomatic Committee must charter a section of the train for them. This is not called a flower car, but simply a chartered car for welcoming guests. (37)

The World of Entertainment

### The Entertainment Industry in Occupied Suzhou

— Wei Xiu

Kun Opera Since Suzhou fell under occupation, the entertainment industry has presented a kind of deformed development. It began with the Kun opera of the Xianni Society, which borrowed the site of the Yúcái Elementary School of Xuanmiao Temple as a theater. Ticket prices were divided into one mao and five fen and two mao, and they staged continuous full-length good plays. The performance was serious and continued for as long as three months. Many people in Suzhou understand Kun opera, and many can hum a few lines, so the business was really not bad. Later, it was hired by the Shanghai Oriental Bookstore before it ended its performance.

Beijing Opera There are three theaters for Beijing Opera: Kaiming, Dongwu, and Jincheng. Kaiming is in the North Bureau of the city, and the various agencies and scenery were not damaged at all in the war, so it opened the earliest. Dongwu is on Hengma Road in Changmen. Part of the gate and the backstage were destroyed. It has now been slightly repaired and opened. Jincheng is on Shilu Road in Changmen, and it rents several large rooms in a flat house and reluctantly sets up a stage for performance. Kaiming and Jincheng each performed Journey to the West, and Dongwu performed Honglian Temple, competing with each other in the scenery of the agencies. Dongwu also used the "Girls' Dance Troupe" to attract people. The ticket prices are not out of the range of one mao and two mao. Kaiming has the best business, Dongwu is second, and Jincheng is worse, but generally they can all maintain it without losing money.

Movies There are three movie theaters: Suzhou, Daguangming, and YMCA. The films must be checked by the Pseudo-Wu County Education Bureau and the Suzhou Special Service Class, and only after obtaining a permit can they be released. It is said that as long as there is no danger (?) in the film, a permit can be obtained. Films such as Thunderstorm and Sunrise have been shown; costume films such as Diaochan and Pan Jinlian are particularly popular. As for the Suzhou Grand Theater, it still consistently shows "foreign films."

Tanhuang In terms of Suzhou Variety, like magic tricks, Xuanjuan, Tangming, Nanci, etc., there have always been two societies, "Yanqing" and "Kaizhi". The scope of business is dedicated to happy hall meetings. Usually, because Suzhou is so crowded, every time there is a "painting hall", it is too busy to respond, so the effort is tightened, and hall meetings are almost non-existent. The business has plummeted, so they have to change their policy and seek other ways out. They have set up a class to organize Tanhuang performances in order to maintain it. At the same time, street singers have also put together classes to organize and perform. Therefore, there are many Tanhuang performances in Suzhou now, and the styles are also very complicated. There are Tanhuang from all over the place, such as Su Tan, Ben Tan, Xi Tan, Changshu, Changzhou Tanhuang, etc., which can hardly be counted. There are about five or six families with a slightly larger scale, roles, costumes, and relatively complete scenery, such as Daohe, Guotai, Fuan, Daxin, and New Oriental. The rest are mostly simple and indescribable.

Storytelling Theater The most common entertainment venue in Suzhou is undoubtedly the storytelling theater. Only four cents per person, with tea included, it can be said to be popularized. There are more than sixty venues in the whole city, but not many can sell "over a hundred". The reason is that the "Sounding Dang" gentlemen are not in the local area, and their appeal is not great, so it is difficult to improve the business. But in the blink of an eye, the lunar New Year is approaching, and the Suzhou "Association Book" will be listed. At that time, the heroes will gather, and there will be a lively scene.

### Talking about the Lineup of the Gengchun Opera Society

— Chang Gong

The establishment of Gengchun is nearly forty years ago, and it is the oldest group in the Shanghai Opera Circle. There are many talents. Next Monday, it will perform at the Carlton to raise money for refugee relief. Since you gentlemen have this righteous act, I am acquainted with most of the people in this circle, so I dare not refuse the responsibility of introducing them. When talking about Kun Opera, everyone knows Mr. Xu Lingyun. He started on stage when he was more than ten years old, taking Fu Jiao (i.e. the second face) as his main job, but he is also proficient in Laosheng, Jin Sheng, Pheasant Tail Sheng, Clown Jing, Laodan, etc. He is not shy to have been an all-rounder with deep attainments. In his Jing Jiao Opera, I have only seen the play "Liu Tang" in my later years. The performance of the famous family is indeed extraordinary: "Marrying Sister" has only recently been performed. The body movements of this play are already heavy, and Lingyun has added more, making it even more splendid. Lingyun has three sons, all of whom are proficient in Kun Opera. Mr. Shao Jiu's Guan Sheng is especially valued at the time. His demeanor is generous and magnificent, his performance is natural and generous, and his clear voice and delicate singing method make his King Xi Opera (Kun Opera does not have this term, now borrowed) comparable to Anhan and Xielu. This time, he will be able to perform "Amazing Changes" with ease and joy, and lovers of Kunqu Opera should listen to it carefully.

The Yini and delicate part of the play between Sheng and Dan is that no one knows, but in order to accomplish these four words, it is really rare, and it is especially necessary for Sheng and Dan to match the steel. Mr. Yin Zhenxian's Sheng and Ms. Ye Xiaohong's Dan have long been praised by the opera world. The plays that the two gentlemen have collaborated on, such as "Qiao Vinegar", "Hiding Boat", "Stealing Poetry", "Dressing Up", "Kneeling Pool", etc., have been praised as extraordinary. The play "Broken Bridge" has been collaborated on by the two gentlemen many times, and it is truly an immortal work that cannot be seen in ordinary singing venues. Mr. Zhao Xing Shu has the eyes of a beautiful woman, and he can play many plays, all of which are exquisite, and he has a deep research on "Jiā Qī". I have often said that this play is the elite of the daily play, and all the body movements are concentrated on. Those are clumsy strokes that can be described. When appreciating Xing Shu's performance

Kun Opera Laosheng is divided into three types: Sheng, Wai, and Mo. I know three people in Gengchun who sing Laosheng. They are all well-known figures in the opera world. In my private opinion, Mr. Xu Liecheng is dignified and clear, suitable for Sheng, Mr. Chen Shiqian is full of vigor, suitable for Wai; Mr. Guan Jian is knowledgeable and meticulous, suitable for Mo, Liecheng's "Yunyang Fajun" has always been famous, full of energy, stable stage steps, from beginning to end, not at all. It is a masterpiece. Shiqian retreated to be an assistant this time, which is unavoidable to avoid the important and take the light. I suddenly stringed "Looking in the Mirror". I don't know what medicine is sold in his gourd.

Mr. Cui Qianxian is an amateur Beijing Opera player and joined the performance of "Yaguanlou". It is purely a work of skill. Mr. Lu Jianzhi strung "Send Son", with a tragic meaning. The ink of the poets Ge Junmeiting Wang Junji is driven by the heart of charity.

A wide variety of acts, a great collection of artistic talent from Tianjin and Beijing, with various humorous interjections, promises to be very lively. As for the play "Visiting the Temple," performed jointly by all the performers, the plot twists are extremely humorous. Such a grand event has never been seen in Shanghai. Lovers of Tianjin and Beijing theatrical arts, why not go and see it? Ticket prices are divided into two yuan, one yuan, and thirty cents. It is said that all proceeds will be used to help the disaster-stricken compatriots in the war zone, a righteous act worthy of praise. It can be predicted that the stage will be crowded with traffic like dragons and horses at that time, reaching its peak.

Zhang Zhuxuan, the martial artist from the Xinji Grand Theatre, whose father, Guifen, has been performing in Kunming with Zhao Ruquan's troupe for more than two months without news, went with his sister, Zhuyan, to the Zhao's house yesterday to inquire about their recent situation.

### The Art of Skating (10)

— Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen

Beginner's Introduction (Continued)

Primary and Secondary - The important parts of the body during skating, such as the shoulders, arms, hips, knees, legs, feet, and toes, all have primary and secondary roles. The primary refers to the foot moving on the ground and the upper half of the body above that foot. For example, when the right foot is moving on the ground, the right shoulder etc. is called the primary shoulder, and the left shoulder etc. is called the secondary shoulder.

Supplementary Rules (1) If someone is practicing freestyle skating in the center of the rink, those practicing turning or circling should not cross the center of the rink.

(2) When the secondary foot pushes forward, the entire edge of the sole of the shoe (i.e., both wheels on one side) must be used. Do not push only with the toes. If the heel is slightly stressed, this problem can be avoided. Gradually lengthen the stride, and alternate between the two feet.

(3) The shoes should not grind on the ground. Landing should be silent and must land directly on the side to be used.

(4) When moving forward using the outer edge of the shoe, the body should be as sideways as possible. The secondary shoulder and leg should be mostly behind. When moving forward, the secondary shoulder must move before the secondary leg.

(5) When moving the secondary leg forward, diligently do not bend the knee. This is a common problem, and beginners should pay particular attention. The knee can be slightly bent after it has moved forward.

(6) The method of moving the legs forward and backward varies from person to person, but it should be even and harmonious, not too fast or too slow. Theoretically, the secondary leg moves forward or backward about halfway through a step. In fact, when moving forward, the secondary leg is behind, moving forward halfway to a step, and only moving forward when about to stop. When moving backward, move it backward in the first half of the step, that is, in one step, and gradually move it backward after starting, so that the secondary leg is on the moving foot.

(7) When moving forward, the primary shoulder guides. When moving backward, the secondary shoulder guides.

(8) When skating in an arc, the body should be sideways, and the shoulder and hip should be parallel to the primary foot and turn with the shape. (In the diagram, the solid line shows the right foot, the dotted line shows the left foot, R shows the right shoulder, and L shows the left shoulder.)

Statement - The two illustrations in the previous issue were both inverted, please note.

### Secret History of the Imperial Court and the Pear Garden of the Former Capital (103)

— Xu Muyun

Two sheng, two dan, and two jing actually fought and cursed for jealousy over a play.

However, later, Xirui became quite fond of this because the pastor was firm, and he also liked to stroll around Yuezi and pick out personal things, which caused his voice to be far inferior to before. Hao Shouchen's whole family were Christians and did not have any habits such as smoking and drinking, so his voice gradually improved over time. Coincidentally, in a certain hall, a troublemaker specially ordered them to perform "The True and False Li Kui." Originally, Hao and Hou did not have much hatred for each other, but among the audience, there were loyal members of both parties, each supporting their own actors and cheering for their own favorites. It was on these two points that a storm was triggered. It happened that Xirui's voice was not in good condition that day, so his singing and reciting were slightly worse than Shouchen's. Therefore, those who supported Hao became particularly proud and assumed an air as if Xirui had been chewed up by Shouchen. The two on the stage were also one smug and the other dejected. In this way, the hatred between the two became great. Later, during the fight scene in "The True and False Li Kui," Hou Xirui brought out his signature skills. Xirui had a background in the science class, not to mention that. In terms of physique, he was slightly taller than Shouchen, so he was much more flexible and convenient when turning than the fat and short Shouchen. Shouchen's martial skills were originally weaker, and coupled with the fact that the soles of his boots were too high and his body was bulky, how could he be as agile and nimble as Xirui when wielding double axes, flying up and down? At first, he could barely support for a few moves, but later he was simply powerless to fight back, retreating straight back and almost being pushed to the edge of the stage and falling down. At this time, Xirui's face was redeemed, and he was extremely proud. At the same time, those who supported him in the audience also felt a hundred times more energetic and could greatly raise their eyebrows. The above-mentioned three instances of eating opera vinegar all occurred a decade or two ago. At the time, it was hard to say that they were very exciting, but looking back on them later, it always felt like a barbaric act lacking in theatrical ethics. Moreover, it is not easy to train a famous actor. If one gets hurt somewhere due to jealousy over a play and becomes disabled, it is indeed an immoral and very regrettable thing.
