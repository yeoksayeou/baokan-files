### Informal Exchange of Views Among Britain, France, and the United States on the Tianjin Incident; Britain and France Highly Value the Attitude of the United States; Hull Meets with the French and Soviet Ambassadors to Discuss the Tianjin Situation; American Public Opinion Advocates Strong Actions to Support Britain and France

(Paris) Regarding the situation in the Far East and the negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Foreign Minister Bonnet received British Ambassador Sir Phipps this afternoon to discuss them. Afterward, he also had a long-distance telephone conversation with French Ambassador to Britain Corbin. It is reported that Britain, France, and the United States are currently exchanging views informally on the Tianjin incident. However, those in charge here place great importance on the attitude of the United States, regarding it as a determining factor in future developments. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)

(Washington) According to well-informed sources, Secretary of State Hull and his staff reviewed the Far East problem with concern last night. The State Department refused to comment on the issue, but there is widespread fear that the current deadlock in the Far East will be broken this weekend, leading to explosive actions that will inevitably directly involve the United States. It is believed here that the hope for a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin incident is very slim. It is reported that Hull will meet with the French Ambassador this week. In recent days, Hull has met with the British Ambassador several times and has also consulted with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew, who has returned from Japan, on the Far East problem. Non-official circles expect that the U.S. will not take any action until the content of the decisions of Britain and France is clarified. It is said that the United States intends to let Britain and France initiate the action first, and then take action. This is because in 1931, the United States initiated action first, but the European democratic countries did not provide subsequent support. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)

(Washington) Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, State Department officials have stated that the matter involves the United States no less than it involves Britain and France. Therefore, the United States has complete sympathy for these countries. Generally speaking, the State Department believes that without American support, the two countries may not be able to genuinely do anything to Japan. However, the U.S. government still intends to wait until the attitude of the British Cabinet is clearer before deciding on a course of action. The reasons for this are twofold: 1. To exchange views with the British and French governments to understand their true intentions. 2. Not to make any hasty expressions that would hinder the discussion of the Neutrality Act amendments. The general public believes that Japan's decision on this matter is part of a grand plan, the ultimate goal of which is to remove Westerners from Asia. Those who comment on current affairs in semi-official circles, although saying that Germany and Italy may not have had any formal consultations with Japan on the Tianjin incident, point out that the arguments used by Japan are consistent with those of Germany and Italy, and the newspapers of these countries all support Japan's actions, so it is almost certain that the three countries are colluding. President Roosevelt and various spokespersons for the U.S. government have repeatedly stated that Germany, Italy, and Japan constitute a triple threat, and this has now been confirmed. At present, traditional anti-Japanese sentiment is once again clearly visible in public opinion, and it is generally advocated that the United States should take strong actions to assist Britain and France. Most newspaper editorials say that it is inappropriate for the United States to continue trading with Japan and call for a boycott of Japanese goods. Even the isolationist Daily News advocates that the British and American navies jointly blockade the Japanese coast. The consensus of public opinion can be seen in this. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently received French Ambassador Saint-Quentin and Soviet Ambassador Oumansky separately today to discuss the situation in Tianjin, China. (Havas dispatch, 17th)

(London) Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, the government authorities are maintaining close contact with the United States and the self-governing colonies, especially Australia and New Zealand, regarding the possibility of imposing economic sanctions on Japan. Among them, the attitude of the United States is highly valued here and regarded as a determining factor in the future development of the Tianjin incident. At the same time, the government authorities are continuing their efforts in the hope that the Tianjin incident can be resolved through diplomatic channels. Therefore, official circles here are quite pleased with the news from Washington that the White House may step in to mediate the dispute between Britain and Japan. However, it is still believed that if Japan formally demands control of the foreign concessions in China, the United States will undoubtedly take joint action with Britain and France to impose economic sanctions on Japan. At that time, as Japan's main creditor and largest customer, the United States will make a significant contribution to retaliatory measures against Japan. In addition, if sanctions are implemented, the entire British Empire must participate unanimously to be effective. For example, the Commonwealth of Australia's trade with Japan accounts for 60% of its total foreign trade. After the implementation of an economic blockade, it should sever business relations with Japan. The Union of South Africa should also stop importing its wool to Japan. The wool produced by the Union of South Africa and the Commonwealth of Australia is of much better quality than that produced by South American countries. Once it stops being sold to Japan, the country will inevitably feel a significant impact. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)

(London) British cabinet members are all awaiting developments in the Tianjin situation tonight. Although Prime Minister Chamberlain is spending the weekend in the countryside, he is in constant contact with his residence. Foreign Secretary Halifax returned to London from Berkshire today to pay close attention to recent developments. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax returned here from Berkshire this afternoon. Despite the weekend holiday, he is still working in the capital, which shows the seriousness of the diplomatic situation, as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are conducting negotiations in Moscow, and the Tianjin incident shows no sign of easing. Regarding the Tianjin incident, the British authorities have not yet made a decision on whether to send warships to transport food to the British concession in Tianjin, pending action by Lieutenant General Noble, commander of the British fleet in China. In addition, the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday morning to review the general situation. Although Prime Minister Chamberlain is spending the weekend in Chequers, he is maintaining close contact with the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)

### British Government Considers Continuing to Loan China £3 Million

(London) According to diplomatic sources last night, in retaliation for the Japanese military blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the British government, in addition to implementing other strict economic sanctions, is also planning to provide China with greater financial assistance. While Britain and France are still discussing the Tianjin crisis, the British government has considered a plan to continue lending China £3 million for the purchase of military equipment and other military supplies from Britain. The loan had already been decided to be paid, but it was delayed because China did not have collateral. The British government no longer insists on this condition because the British government is looking for the most effective way to retaliate against the Japanese blockade. British political circles hope that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai will find a way to prevent the expansion of the serious incident between British troops and "Great Way" police yesterday, as the Shanghai crisis is most likely to involve the United States, causing the United States and Britain to take consistent retaliatory action against Japan. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)

(London) The Manchester Guardian claims that many believe that one of the purposes of the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin is to force Britain and France to stop transporting military supplies to China via Burma and Annam to supply the Chinese army in its war against Japan. Therefore, it is generally believed that the best way to deal with Japanese intimidation is to strengthen aid to China. (Dispatch, 18th)

### Japan Declares Opposition to British Invitation of Third-Party Intervention

(Tokyo) According to Japanese news agency reports, Japanese officials announced that if Britain takes immediate and active steps to protect its interests in China, Japan will inevitably take necessary measures to deal with the new situation. According to the Japanese government, the statements made by British authorities are intended to gloss over the serious mistake made by British authorities in stubbornly refusing to hand over the murderers in the Cheng case, who should have been extradited long ago. Japan can never accept Britain's attempt to invite a third country to intervene in this kind of issue. Britain's proposal of this plan at the last minute is completely inconsistent with the actual situation. What Japan wants in the current incident is a thorough improvement in British policy in China, as expressed in the refusal to extradite the murderers in the Cheng case. This policy of Japan has nothing to do with the policies of other countries related to China and is not as Britain says it is. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

(Tokyo) Japanese political figures recently declared that concrete solutions to the Tianjin incident should continue to be handled by the local Japanese authorities. The Tianjin dispute is purely a conflict between Britain and Japan, so Japan believes that it is not appropriate for Britain to try to involve third countries. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)

(Tokyo) The opinions expressed by semi-official Japanese sources yesterday can be regarded as a response to Britain's potential imposition of economic sanctions on Japan. Semi-official sources here criticized the British statement that "Japan's demands affect the interests of treaty nations in China" and stated, "If Britain really takes active steps to protect its so-called treaty rights, Japan will be forced to take necessary measures to adapt to the new situation." (Haitong dispatch, 18th)

### The Times Advocates that Action Must Be Swift

(London) The situation in Tianjin, China, was recently commented on by the Sunday Times and the Observer weekly. It was said that the door to negotiations is not yet closed, but if Japan expresses covetousness towards the foreign concessions in China, Britain will respond with the strongest action. The foreign affairs reporter of the Sunday Times said, "The current situation is not suitable for resolving with slow-moving economic means. In other words, the government must act quickly. At present, the path of negotiation is not yet blocked. The Tianjin incident is only a matter for the British and Japanese authorities. There is no plan for Britain to take action to invite the United States to cooperate. "However, if Japan insists on its demands and creates a stalemate and threatens the interests of all countries in China, the most serious situation will arise as a result. At that time, since the United States and France have the same interests as our country, the United States will inevitably take action to protect its interests. It can be asserted. Now, Japan is asking Britain to cooperate with it to establish its so-called 'New Order in East Asia.' It is impossible for Britain to agree. Other demands from Japan that seek to effectively control British concessions in China are also unacceptable to Britain." The foreign affairs reporter of the Observer weekly said, "Regarding the issue of the extradition of the four Chinese in Tianjin, Britain has suggested organizing a joint committee to resolve it. This proposal has not been withdrawn, so the current dispute can still be treated as a local event and resolved. However, if the Japanese government does decide to raise more far-reaching issues involving the position of all countries in China, the British government should do everything possible to defend its position, as it did in the past and still does today. At that time, it is not uncommon for the United States and France to take parallel actions." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)

### French Newspapers Criticize Germany and Italy for Instigating Japan to Provoke Britain

(Paris) Hard News today claimed that, according to Italian newspaper reports, the current Tianjin incident is part of a grand plan already formulated by the Axis powers, aimed at destroying democratic countries. However, the news received in the capitals of Britain, France, and the United States is not the same. According to diplomatic sources, Japan has decided to limit the scope of its actions. The Paris Times is not optimistic about the Far East incident. Its editorial states that there is an idea that Germany and Italy feel that they will eventually have to fight on two fronts, and now they are recruiting Japan to join what is in fact an alliance of three countries, and instigating Japan to provoke Britain under the guise of protecting purely Japanese interests, in order to divide the strength of democratic countries. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

(Moscow) Soviet newspapers today broke their silence on the Tianjin situation and published discussions stating that Tianjin and other recent incidents involving British people in China are merely pretexts used by Japan to create conflict. The real reason for the current tension in the Far East is Japan's desire to expel Britain and the United States from China and seize public concessions in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Editorial

### Tianjin and Danzig

The Tianjin problem of today, whether examined under a microscope, revealing its essence; or viewed through a telescope, reflecting the perceptions in the hearts and minds of the world, when compared in scale and importance to the Danzig problem, which has long been the focus of international attention but has not yet stabilized, the significance of the Tianjin problem is undoubtedly deeper and its implications greater. Danzig is a free city; its legal status is subordinate to Poland, but its political potential is tied to Germany. The problem is: Germany demands it, Poland refuses. The back-and-forth of the problem lies between the gains and losses of the two parties. The impact of the problem lies in the future struggle for dominance in the Baltic Sea. The main actors in the problem are Germany and Poland, and the European countries take sides. The Tianjin problem arises from Japan's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, which affects the French concession. What will be decided by this is: (1) Whether Britain and France will de facto recognize the Japanese military and puppet regime in North China; (2) Whether Britain and France will maintain the Tianjin concession; (3) Whether other foreign concessions in China will be maintained; (4) Whether the rights and interests of foreign countries in China will be maintained; (5) Whether foreign countries will withdraw from the Far East; (6) Whether the policy of foreign aid to China will be abandoned, that is, whether the act of aggression will be recognized; (7) Whether the Nine-Power Treaty will remain effective; (8) Whether various treaties related to the Far East can be unilaterally revised. In summary, will the relationship between Western countries and China, which has been built over the past century, be allowed to be monopolized by Japan and come to an end? As for the extradition of the four suspects and the prestige of Great Britain, the problems are insignificant. In the Danzig problem, Germany takes the offensive in politics, propaganda, and diplomacy, while Poland takes the defensive. Currently, there is almost no development in action. In the Tianjin problem, like a game of chess, Japan has made the first move, and Britain has made a countermove, using diplomacy as an unimportant "ko" and economic action as the "eye-filling" to determine the overall victory or defeat. Japan only gets Germany's cheering for the Tianjin problem and does not get effective assistance; just as Germany only gets Japan's empty sympathy for the Danzig problem and will never generously form an alliance due to anti-communism. Regarding the dispute over Danzig, Germany's ally Italy publicly claims to help Germany but secretly advises Germany not to be rash; but once there is a split, Italy will fully assist Germany. Regarding the Tianjin dispute, Japan's ally Italy praises Japan's courage, and the Roman forum cannot help but express its desire to participate in the division of spoils; but once there is a split, whether in the economic or even military aspects, Germany and Italy cannot help Japan in the slightest. Poland, in order to oppose aggression, has formed an alliance with Britain and France and shown goodwill to the Soviet Union. Its ability to maintain Danzig is actually sheltered under this overall situation; if something happens, it will at least be a war in all of Europe, and it will soon be a war in the whole world; only because of this, everyone is not rash, so there will be no war; even if war is unavoidable, even if Danzig is used as a fuse and war is fought, it will definitely not be fought for Danzig. Britain has not obtained an alliance on international treaties in the Tianjin incident, but the expression of playing the zither and singing, the posture of rolling up sleeves and rising up, has already been seen on both sides of the Atlantic; why is this? Common interests are at stake, and the obligations of treaties are considered to be more powerful.

However, the outcome of the Tianjin problem cannot be said with certainty; in previous comments on the matter, it was said that Britain has three demons: the isolationists in the far-off United States, the arrogance of the near-by Soviet Union, and the self-esteem and self-deception within; these three make Britain lose its enterprising spirit, and there is no necessarily followed method for solving the Tianjin problem. In recent days, the general situation remains like this; what can be used as new information for analysis is: although the United States has no substantial formal expression, yesterday Secretary of State Hull met with the French and Soviet ambassadors to the United States for the Tianjin incident, which can be regarded as a subtle prelude. That is one. The isolationists in the United States pay more attention to European affairs and despise Japan in the Far East; and the Daily News, which has always been biased towards isolationism, yesterday commented that it also advocated that the British and American navies blockade the Japanese coast; that is the second. Western public opinion generally regards the attitude of the United States as a factor in determining the Tianjin incident, and this is why the United States is held morally responsible, and it has its own value; but last night's news from Washington seemed to indicate that what the United States is considering is not the question of whether or not to take action, but whether to hope that Britain and France will take action first and the United States will follow, or whether the three countries will take action in parallel; that is the third. Then, is the key in the United States? If so, and the United States turns a blind eye to the Far East and stays out of the matter, what will happen? This is indeed a major deviation and is worthy of attention; but yesterday, a rare argument was found on the British side, because in recent years, the British government and public have been extremely hesitant and cautious in diplomacy, let alone the long-unseen independent action, and also the long-unheard independent argument; but only in the Tianjin incident, the foreign affairs reporter of the Observer weekly said: If Japan really has far-reaching demands, the British government will do its best to defend its position, and the United States and France will act in parallel, regardless of whether it is asked or not; this is a sign that Britain is gradually recovering its spirit of independent action, that is the fourth. These four are not enough to say for sure how the Tianjin incident will end; but they are important data for observing the direction of the movement. The direction of the movement indicates that the United States is less interested in Poland's Danzig problem and more interested in Britain's Tianjin concession problem. This is not only because of the magnitude of interests and the commonality of concerns; it is also because the United States is an advisor to European affairs. Like walking in muddy ground, like falling into a whirlpool, although it takes a lot of effort, it is difficult to expect quick results; if it stands up to stabilize the Far East, this is as easy for the United States as raising a hand or taking a step; in the past, because public opinion was not mature and Britain was not determined, it was delayed; now, it is no longer the same as before.

### Anti-British Movement Intensifies in Japanese Concession in Tianjin; Severe Shortage of Food in Blockaded Area; Traffic Checks Remain Strict; Residents' Lives Greatly Affected

(Tianjin) Today is the fifth day of the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions. The anti-British propaganda movement has become increasingly intense. In addition to publishing anti-British articles in Japanese newspapers, leaflets are also being distributed and non-fee radio broadcasts are being carried out. Loudspeakers have been installed at various search locations. The food situation in the concession has aroused serious concern among the general residents. The stalls in the vegetable markets are all empty. British Municipal Council General Manager Tiber told a Reuters reporter today that although the supply of rice and flour is very sufficient, the supply of vegetables, meat, and fish has actually been cut off due to Japanese ships patrolling the Hai River. The memorial ceremony held yesterday afternoon in front of the graves of soldiers who died in the Boxer Rebellion was quite simple. The Japanese side had troops, representatives from the consulate, and boy scouts, totaling 30 people, to participate. The cars they were traveling in entered the French concession and were escorted by French police to the border of the British concession, then escorted by two British Municipal Council police officers on motorcycles to the location of the graves. When the British ship "Mrs. Maller" arrived in Tianjin yesterday, Japanese search personnel boarded the ship at the Dalian Mail Steamer Company dock to inspect it, but it was not strict. After inquiring about the name, flag, and nationality of the shipowner, they let it sail to the British concession Bund. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Japanese Ban Mailing of American-Run Newspaper

(Tianjin) Today is the fifth day of the blockade of the Tianjin concession. The anti-British demonstration movement in the Japanese Garden in the Japanese concession can be said to have reached a boiling point, but no unfortunate incidents have occurred in the British and French concessions. Also, at 11:30 this morning, there were reports of violent machine-gun fire, and the residents could not help but be alarmed. It was later learned that the Japanese were just practicing shooting, and people's hearts were settled. Also, the Japanese have already begun to despise the interests of Americans. The English-language North China Star, originally a newspaper run by Americans, has been banned from mailing by the Japanese since Friday. The publisher and editor, Mr. Fox, is scheduled to ask the American consulate to negotiate on his behalf on Monday. The Englishman Smith, who was injured in the head by the puppet Chinese police with a pistol butt yesterday, is still in Japanese custody. Since the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession, food has gradually become scarce, but it is not expected to be in short supply in the short term. However, the concerns of all parties about this are undeniable. According to Municipal Council General Manager Burns (transliteration), the British concession has only enough meat and other food for two days, but a small amount of vegetables still enters the concession every day. As for rice and flour, there is a lot of stock, so there is no need to worry. The ice factory in the French concession also has no problems. Milk is also unlikely to be lacking. According to today's prices for food, meat has increased three times compared to before, and vegetables are virtually impossible to buy. Also, Japanese sentries often only allow Chinese to enter the concession but not to leave the concession. This may be a way for the Japanese to freeload and deplete the food in the concession, or it may be clear evidence that rice and flour are not sufficient outside the concession. As for the claim in the newspapers that Chinese in the British and French concessions refuse to pay patrolman taxes and any taxes, prominent Chinese here have all acknowledged that there is such a movement.

Nearby Strongholds of Neihuang Gradually Recovered

(Zhengzhou) The Chinese army in northern Henan has been attacking Neihuang for days. The Japanese army relied on intense firepower and superior fortifications to resist stubbornly, and fierce fighting continued all night. Many Japanese were killed, and Shanyidian, Wangzhuang River Estuary, and other places have been recovered successively. Fifty-one Japanese soldiers were captured, and 51 rifles and handguns were seized. The pontoon bridge at Wangzhuang River Estuary was also burned by the Chinese army, and the Japanese army's return route in Neihuang was completely cut off. At noon the day before yesterday, the Japanese army suddenly increased the number of artillery troops by 300 from the north bank of the Wei River, with four or five mountain guns. They fired more than 200 shells at the Chinese from the Hebei bank, seemingly trying to forcibly cross the Wei River to reinforce Neihuang. After the Chinese officers and soldiers calmly responded, they finally did not succeed. Then, the Japanese army actually released suffocating poison gas bombs, but the wind direction suddenly changed, injuring many Japanese soldiers instead. They are still facing each other across the Wei River. (18th)

Tunxi: The Japanese army in Shuanggou, which belongs to Wuhe in northern Anhui, has been under siege by the Chinese army for days, and many have been injured and killed. The day before yesterday, the Chinese army bravely rushed into the Japanese formation and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. Japanese corpses were all over the streets. The remnants could not hold out and fled in panic. The Chinese army then recovered Shuanggou. (Dispatch, 18th)

### Japanese Troops in Southern Shanxi Retreating Northward; Chinese Troops Fiercely Attacking Anyi and Yuncheng; Intense Battles in Zhongtiao Mountains for Ten Days, Japanese Casualties Reach 7,000; Japanese Troops Invading Zhangdian in Two Routes Repelled

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, the Japanese troops in southern Shanxi are now retreating northward due to unsuccessful advances. Chinese troops are currently fiercely attacking the important Japanese strongholds of Anyi and Yuncheng. Simultaneously, the Japanese troops advancing eastward from Xia County towards Shangjiawei (transliteration) and Jiangjiayao (transliteration) have also been repelled by Chinese forces. Although both locations were briefly captured during the Japanese advance, the Japanese troops retreated back to Xia County after a counter-attack by Chinese forces. Furthermore, Nanlinqiao, a crucial town on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, has been completely surrounded by Chinese troops, resulting in the deaths of over 400 Japanese soldiers. (Eighteenth, Associated Press)

Yu Ji: At dawn on the 15th, over a thousand Japanese infantry and artillery troops, along with two cannons, advanced towards the western mountains of China in separate routes from Xigan Village on the west bank of the Fen River. The various Chinese garrisons in the area joined forces to resist, and after five hours of intense fighting, the Japanese troops retreated, unable to succeed. It is estimated that over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded in this battle, while the Chinese side also suffered over twenty casualties. (Eighteenth dispatch)

(Chongqing) The fighting in southern Shanxi is intense. Five thousand Japanese troops, divided into four routes, attacked the Chinese positions east of the Zhangdian-Maojindu highway. Another force of seven thousand Japanese troops, reportedly using poison gas, launched a flanking attack on the Chinese positions west of the highway. According to Chinese sources, Japanese casualties in this battle have exceeded four thousand. Japanese corpses and wounded soldiers are being transported from Zhangdian to Yuncheng and Anyi in southern Shanxi. Meanwhile, according to Chinese military sources, recent joint Chinese air and ground attacks have resulted in over half a Japanese regiment being killed or wounded at Fenglingdu, across from Tongguan. Twelve Japanese cannons were destroyed. It is reported that several squadrons of Chinese bombers destroyed eight hundred Japanese vehicles traveling on the Yuncheng-Taiyuan route. Japanese military installations in Yuncheng also suffered losses. (Eighteenth, China United Press)

(Xi'an) A unit of Chinese troops occupied Maojiashan on the 16th, with most of the Japanese troops in that area retreating towards Zhangdian. In the past ten days of intense fighting with Chinese troops in the Zhongtiao Mountains, Japanese casualties have reached six to seven thousand. (Seventeenth dispatch)

Yuanqu: On the morning of the 13th, over ten thousand Japanese troops from the Zhangdian area invaded from the east, harassing Chinese positions along two routes from the north and south. One route, consisting of four to five thousand Japanese troops invading south from Zhangdian, has already been driven north to Maojiashan (southeast of Zhangdian) after a fierce Chinese counterattack. Another route, consisting of four to five thousand Japanese troops invading northeast from Zhangdian, has been routed north of Maojiashan, with countless corpses and military supplies abandoned.

### Serious Situation in Tianjin; New Incident Brewing in Europe; Frequent Contacts Between Germany, Italy, and Japan; Danzig Issue to be Triggered First

(London) According to diplomatic sources here last night, Germany and Italy intend to exploit the British-Japanese crisis in the Far East to initiate a new incident in Europe soon. The two Axis powers originally planned to launch another European crisis after the autumn harvest, as they were unwilling to mobilize troops before the harvest was completed. However, the current situation in the Far East presents a golden opportunity, proving very tempting to the authorities in Berlin and Rome. (Eighteenth, Associated Press)

(Berlin) The Japanese ambassadors to Germany and Italy have consistently advocated for a German-Japanese alliance. They have recently held repeated discussions with German officials. It is reported that the discussions concern the situation in the Far East, particularly the Anglo-Japanese dispute. Today, the German government mouthpiece, Diplomatic Information, published the first clear implication of German support for Japan's actions in Tianjin, stating that any country that fails to recognize the signs of the times and displays a reactionary spirit in its foreign relations must now experience the inevitable course of natural development. (Eighteenth, Reuters)

(Berlin) According to observations by political figures here, as a result of the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, the British government has been forced to shift its diplomatic attention to the Far East. This development is beneficial to the progress of the German-Italian Axis. They believe that the situation in Tianjin is bound to trigger a very serious crisis, and the fact that this crisis is occurring during the Anglo-Soviet negotiations for a military alliance is of great significance. The Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, is currently staying in Berlin, discussing Japan's policy on the Tianjin incident with the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima. According to sources close to the Japanese Embassy here, "The Japanese side will take surprising actions." However, it was not specified whether these "surprising actions" would involve Japan joining the German-Italian alliance. In any case, observers unanimously agree that there is a kind of political triangular alliance between Germany, Japan, and Italy in the developments in the Far East, which is causing considerable embarrassment to the British side. At the same time, German officials yesterday openly expressed sympathy for Japan. However, the German public still does not have such pro-Japanese sentiments. Yesterday, the German Foreign Ministry's official newspaper, "Foreign Affairs and Politics," called foreign concessions in China "bases for conspiracy" and stated that Italy is deeply aware of this point. (Eighteenth, Associated Press)

(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano received German Ambassador Mackensen today for a lengthy conversation. Officials have not commented on the content of the conversation, but it is generally understood that the two sides discussed the situation in Tianjin, China, and its impact. At the same time, Italy's attitude towards the issue of the Free City of Danzig was also discussed. (Seventeenth, Havas)

### Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations Do Not Involve the Far East; British and French Authorities Issue Denials, Claiming German Propaganda Has a Specific Purpose

(London) Rumors that the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are discussing the expansion of an anti-aggression organization to include the Far East in Moscow have been strongly denied by responsible officials here. They affirmed that the scope of the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement remains strictly limited to European affairs. It is said that the intention of spreading these rumors is solely to exacerbate the already tense relations between Britain and Japan. (Seventeenth, Havas)

(Paris) Rumors that the most important issue currently being discussed by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow is the extension of the trilateral mutual assistance agreement to the Far East have been denied by responsible officials here, stating that these claims are completely unfounded and are likely a tactic of the German side. Because the Soviet Union is in a special position in the Far East, it declared at the outset of negotiations that the mutual assistance agreement would be limited to maintaining security in Europe, with the main principle being the division of responsibilities between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Western and Eastern Europe. There is no intention to extend it to the Far East, and this remains the case to this day. However, the occurrence of the Tianjin incident at such a crucial time is certainly enough to encourage Britain and France to quickly conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union. Therefore, it can be said that the events in the Far East will indirectly affect the ongoing negotiations in Moscow, but it cannot be said that these negotiations focus on extending the trilateral mutual assistance agreement to the Far East. The various rumors are intended to make Japanese public opinion believe that Britain and the Soviet Union are joining hands in the Far East, hoping to pressure Japan to join the German-Italian alliance. It can be asserted that this is the case. (Seventeenth, Havas)

(Moscow) The talks between the British and French ambassadors and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov regarding the trilateral anti-aggression agreement are expected to continue tomorrow. British Foreign Office special envoy Strang met with French Ambassador Payart and British Ambassador Seeds yesterday morning, but they may not meet with Molotov again this week. (Eighteenth, Reuters)

Egypt and Turkey Discuss Joint Defense

Istanbul, Turkey: Egyptian Foreign Minister Yahya arrived here at 5:00 PM on Wooden Day, refusing to speak to reporters. According to Turkish political figures, Foreign Minister Yahya's visit will involve discussions with Turkish authorities regarding Egypt's position after the establishment of the Anglo-Turkish mutual assistance agreement, as well as issues of joint Egyptian-Turkish defense. However, it may not involve Egypt joining the Near East Pact. (Note: The Near East Pact was signed by Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.) (Seventeenth, Havas)

Italian Fleet Cruises in the Western Mediterranean

(Rome) The First Fleet of the Italian Navy, consisting of two battleships, ten cruisers, and over twenty destroyers and torpedo boats, led by Admiral Bigaidi, is scheduled to depart from the Port of Naples tomorrow morning and sail to the waters off Spain, Portugal, and Moroccan Africa for a cruise lasting half a month. In addition, according to the Roman newspaper "Il Popolo di Roma," the Second Fleet of the Italian Navy will also sail to the eastern Mediterranean Sea in the near future for a cruise.

Portuguese President Tours the Union of South Africa and Inspects Colonies

Lisbon: Portuguese President Carmona departed today at the special invitation of King George VI of England to inspect Portuguese African colonies and tour the Union of South Africa. Carmona is the first foreign head of state to officially tour the Union of South Africa. Here, Carmona's trip is seen as an indirect but decisive response to speculation that Portuguese colonies are included in the idea of a "redistribution" of "vital living space."

Lisbon: The President of the Portuguese Republic, Carmona, sailed yesterday on the Colonial Liner to inspect the Portuguese colony of Mozambique, escorted by two Portuguese warships along the way. It is reported that the President's visit will last three months, which Portuguese officials consider extremely important. (Eighteenth, Haitong)

### Goebbels' Speech: Danzig Must Be Returned to Germany; Claims Polish Theories Are Not Worth Refuting; Great Mistake if Britain Thinks Germany is Weak

Danzig: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels arrived in Danzig last night and gave a speech to the public as follows:

People of Danzig, I have come here from Germany to convey greetings from the German leader and people to you. You share the same language and culture with the Germans. Here, I am surrounded by German culture and German architecture, and I am filled with German thought and spirit. Your firm determination to return to the embrace of your motherland will not be prevented by anyone. Those who attempt to suppress it and prevent its realization are either reckless and ignorant fools or narrow-minded and jealous individuals, who are not worth mentioning. Danzig has become an international issue of global attention overnight, which was not what you originally desired. What you desired was that Danzig should belong to the territory of Greater Germany. The Polish theory states that a city located at the mouth of a river should belong to the country through which the river flows. Therefore, Danzig, located at the mouth of the Vistula River, should belong to Poland. What nonsense is this! Look at Rotterdam in the Netherlands, does it not lie at the mouth of the Rhine River, and does the Rhine River not flow through German territory? Shall Rotterdam also be transferred to German territory? This kind of argument is fragile and untenable. So why is Danzig so unfortunate that it must be controlled by Poland and cannot freely join the embrace of Germany? British Foreign Secretary Halifax declared in the British House of Commons a few days ago that Britain hopes that the Danzig issue can be resolved through friendly negotiations. Observing Britain's recent words and actions, we can see their insidious intentions, trying to repeat the old trick of encircling Germany as in 1914 and attempting to succeed. They are absolutely wrong if the British think that we are weak and can be bullied. Germany under the rule of the National Socialist Party has a wise leader and a strong army, and its strength is sufficient and not to be intimidated by empty words. The illusions and empty talk of Britain and Poland are nothing more than flowers in the fog and a fool's dream in our eyes. After severely criticizing Britain and Poland, Goebbels returned to the topic and said: The people of Danzig have felt a sense of belonging to Germany for more than a day. Since Danzig was forced to separate from Germany, it has harbored the hope of reuniting. Previously, when Führer Hitler delivered a speech to the parliament, he clearly stated that Danzig is one of the German cities, and the people of Danzig long to return to Germany. These words are of profound significance. Hitler has never been one for empty talk, and what he says is always meaningful. Therefore, the men, women, old, and young of Danzig can be confident about the future of Danzig. Germany under the leadership of the National Socialist Party will always be by your side. (Thunderous applause) People of Danzig, people around the world are watching tonight's events. The newspapers of Britain and France claim that you have no desire to return to Germany. The expression of your unity at this moment can give the strongest and most powerful reply to those who spread rumors and make false accusations. Tonight, I, as a representative of Germany, would like to express my gratitude to you. I remember before coming here, I hoped to strengthen your determination. I never expected that your expression tonight would strengthen my determination. How fortunate! I wish our leader long live, the German Danzig lives long, and Greater Germany lives long! (Eighteenth, Haitong)

Danzig: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels arrived here at 8:00 PM today and immediately went to the Grand Theater to watch a dance performance. He also gave a speech in front of the theater to the welcoming crowds, mainly explaining that the city of Danzig belongs to the Germanic people and that Poland has no rights to Danzig. He said, "The citizens of Danzig now have an irresistible and strong desire to return to their great motherland. This desire is a natural response between nations and cannot be stopped by anyone. Only those countries that are full of malice, envy, and lack of understanding will oppose it. You must know that the city you live in has become an important international issue overnight. Your wishes in the past, today, and the future have all been seen by the world, that is, to merge into Greater Germany. (At this point, the crowd shouted the slogan "One Germany, One Nation, One Leader.") It is a pity that the beautiful German city you live in is located at the mouth of the Vistula River. According to the Polish view, all cities located at the mouth of a river should belong to the country through which the river flows. Then, the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands (located at the mouth of the Rhine River) should also be transferred to Germany (the crowd laughed). But we don't have to care about Poland's high-pitched tone. This is just a momentary impulse for them, and it will naturally disappear after a period of time." Minister Goebbels then fiercely criticized Britain, pointing out that it should not give Poland a blank check and attempt to encircle Germany. "If they think that Germany is a weak country, then they are mistaken. It must be known that National Socialist Germany is not only not weak but is already extremely strong. The army we possess is strong and is the champion of the world (the crowd cheered). People who believe that Führer Hitler will retreat under threats and yield under intimidation will commit an extremely dangerous mistake. Therefore, all Germanic people living in the city of Danzig should have absolute confidence in your future. National Socialist Germany will always be your backing. Wherever there are Germans living, Germany will rise up to help them. Now, please take advantage of this holiday to cheer together for the Führer, long live the German Danzig, and long live Greater Germany." At this point, the crowd cheered loudly, and some shouted slogans such as "Jews and Poles should go to hell!" (Seventeenth, Havas)

Danzig City: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech at the "Cultural Week" conference here yesterday. Although it was drizzling that day, no less than tens of thousands of people gathered along the way. When Goebbels was traveling to the venue by car, the people along the way shouted, "We are willing to return home after Goebbels' speech," and "We need to return to the German home." Goebbels' speech said, "The Führer will surely come to Danzig. Germans should return to the German home. Poles cannot forever sanction Germans. The German government will never betray the German residents of Danzig." After Goebbels finished speaking, there was thunderous applause and cheers. (Eighteenth, Haitong News Agency)

Berlin Denies German Mobilization

(Berlin) The rumor of German mobilization is rampant. The Haitong News Agency reporter went to the authorities to investigate the truth. It is said that it is completely untrue. The reports from the British and French sides claiming that the German 8th Division, 18th Division, and 31st Infantry Division, the 4th Armored Division, and the 118th Heavy Artillery Division are concentrated in the Moravian Mährisch Ostrau area, and that the traffic between Iglau and Brno has been cut off are all fabricated and sensationalist. Fundamentally, the German army's organization does not have a 118th Heavy Artillery Division, so how can it be mobilized? By analogy, discerning people can easily see the truth. (Eighteenth, Haitong)

(London) The Sunday Dispatch recently reported that German Führer Hitler is preparing to make demands of a shocking nature, which will make the European political situation more serious. According to reliable sources here, there are six demands in total, namely: (1) The Free City of Danzig should be merged into Germany; (2) Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula are vital to Germany's survival, and Britain should completely abandon all political and economic interests in those areas; (3) Britain should return the Gibraltar military port to Spain; (4) Revise the legal status of the French port of Djibouti in East Africa to benefit Italy; (5) Reorganize the Suez Canal Company; (6) The issue of Germany recovering its old colonies should be put up for discussion. In order to have a backing for these demands, Führer Hitler intends to keep Germany in a state of "constant mobilization," accelerate the completion of the third line of defense in the west, and concentrate heavy troops in eastern Moravia and along the border of the Slovakian Protectorate.

High Commissioner to the Philippines Opposes Philippine Independence

Honolulu: US High Commissioner to the Philippines McNutt arrived here tonight. He was unwilling to make any statements about his recent trip to Japan or his views on the Far East issue. When asked about being nominated as a Democratic presidential candidate, McNutt said, "I have no such ambition." McNutt also said that, in his view, Philippine independence is tantamount to "economic suicide." The US military should maintain a long-term presence in the Philippines.

(Berlin) General Gamelin, Chief of the General Staff of the French National Defense, recently visited Britain. Local newspapers here have commented on this, saying that the issue of unified command between the British and French armies in wartime has already been settled, and the post of Commander-in-Chief of the two countries' armies has been internally decided, to be held by General Gamelin. The local guiding newspaper stated, "The post of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces of the two countries carries great responsibility, and it should naturally be held by the leader of the French army. General Gamelin is well-versed in modern strategy and deeply understands the psychology of French soldiers, so he will certainly be able to fulfill the role happily. As for the French army, we have dealt with them before, and their officers are well-trained, and their soldiers have strong combat capabilities, which is well known to us." (Havas dispatch, 18th)

Two New British Cruisers Launched, Aircraft Carrier to Be Built

(London) Britain's plan to expand its naval armaments is becoming increasingly apparent. On July 18th, two cruisers will be launched simultaneously, one being the "Nigeria," of 10,000 tons, and the other a light cruiser, the "Dido," displacing 5,450 tons. Since the abandonment of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty and the 1931 London Naval Treaty, Britain has had a new shipbuilding plan, deciding to increase the strength of cruisers from fifty to seventy, which will be implemented this year. It is reported that fifteen cruisers commenced construction in 1939, six of which have now been launched. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)

British Army to Hold Regular Exercises

(London) The British Army will hold large-scale regular exercises from September 15th to 23rd in "Yorkshire," located approximately two hundred miles from the British military base. It is said that the participating troops will engage in attack and defense according to wartime formations. At that time, the Royal Air Force and tank formations will join in cooperation. The scope of activities of the "Allied forces" and "enemy forces" will be subject to considerable restrictions. Also, when the army is "mobilized," special trains will be opened on the railways and highways from Aldershot to the Yorkshire border to facilitate troop movement. At the same time, strong air force teams will closely cooperate with the "enemy forces." According to the War Office, the period of this exercise is quite long, so the morale of the soldiers will be strained, and officers and soldiers at all levels can therefore become familiar with their scope of work. As for the testing of troop deployment and reinforcement, results can also be obtained. If the "enemy" aircraft can cut off supply lines, the Allied forces will suffer significant difficulties.

### New US Neutrality Act Submitted to House for Discussion, Accompanied by Two Reports

(Washington) The new Neutrality Act proposed by Representative Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has been submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion after being reviewed and passed by the committee, along with two reports. The report of the majority party of the Foreign Affairs Committee, i.e., the Democratic Party, contains a comparison by Representative Bloom between the proposed new legislation and the current Neutrality Act, explaining that the new bill does not contain provisions for implementing an embargo on arms for belligerent nations, nor does it apply to countries in a civil war. The report of the minority party, i.e., the Republican Party, expresses disagreement with the Bloom proposal's granting the President the authority to declare a state of war and designate war zones, believing that the power is too broad, and opposes the repeal of the current major clause prohibiting arms embargoes. In addition, Bloom is said to have decided to request the House of Representatives to select a date within a week after the 26th of this month to discuss the new Neutrality Act. At this time, people in the Congressional cloakroom say that Republican members strongly oppose it, and some Democratic members who favor isolationism will collude with them, but Bloom's proposal will certainly be voted through.

South Ireland - Military Training Aimed Only at Strengthening National Defense, de Valera's Speech

Dublin - During a recent discussion of the budget in the House of Representatives of the Irish Free State, Prime Minister de Valera made an important speech, stating, in brief, that rumors that government authorities had told people entering military service that they would be fighting against Britain and Northern Ireland were baseless. In fact, the goal of our military training is only to strengthen national defense. The government's policy can be summarized in one sentence: within the scope of our power, we will avoid being drawn into war; that is all. But to maintain a neutral position, we must have sufficient strength. The mission of the country's troops is precisely that. In short, "If people do not offend me, then I will never offend them." Even if war breaks out in the future, we should still maintain commercial relations with Britain, as this is necessary for the economic life of the country. If the enemy believes that it is enough to hinder their hope of victory and obstructs it unreasonably, then we should rise up in resistance to ensure that the country can continue to trade with Britain.

US Army Designs New Military Aircraft

New York - The US Army is now planning to design and manufacture military aircraft capable of flying 500 miles per hour, as part of the US plan to overhaul its national defense to defend against foreign attacks. Staff members are urging aircraft manufacturers to produce blueprints for the world's fastest fighter aircraft so that the US can soon become a country that cannot be penetrated by overseas air raids in terms of technology. The goal is to have aircraft with speeds above eight miles per minute and a non-stop range of 6,000 miles by the summer of 1940. Germany claims to already have the world's fastest aircraft, capable of flying 469 miles per hour. American aviation experts have been aroused by this claim and are trying to improve existing American aircraft with current top speeds above 400 miles per hour. The range of the newest large-scale bomber must also be expanded. Aircraft designs that were considered impossible two years ago are currently under development. It is heard that the US Army is currently building an 80-ton bomber with a special range in Santa Monica, California. This aircraft and a destroyer with a speed of 500 miles per hour will be test aircraft first. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Japanese Troops in Pinghu Indiscriminately Slaughter Innocent Civilians, City-Wide Search Conducted

Pinghu Correspondence - The Japanese army unit of Ishiyama, newly arrived in Pinghu, ordered the puppet magistrate Hu Shufen to supply 300 piculs of white rice and 5,000 yuan in cash every month. Just as the puppet county government was feeling unable to cope, many Chinese army notices were suddenly found around the county government, advising civilians to flee the county seat within three days, as the Chinese army would attack Pinghu. Those who did not flee would be treated as traitors and killed without mercy. Therefore, men and women in the city were greatly alarmed and carried their clothes and bedding, fleeing to the four gates. The Japanese army, seeing this situation, tried to stop them to no avail, so they forced the puppet county government to order that civilians leaving the city would not be allowed to re-enter the city, nor would they be allowed to carry belongings. However, the civilians still disobeyed, provoking the anger of the Japanese army, who immediately closed the city gates and conducted a city-wide search. In short order, no less than thirty or forty people suspected of colluding with the guerrillas were tied up and taken to the city riverbank, where they were dismembered with large knives or stabbed to death with bayonets five or six times. A rice store clerk, who was quite burly, was found with seven good citizen certificates on his person. The Japanese army identified him as the guerrilla captain and immediately cut his abdomen twice with a knife, causing his internal organs to flow out completely. The scene of his death was extremely tragic. Now, the civilians in the city are almost all living in fear, not knowing if they will survive the next day.

### The Straitened Circumstances of Japan's Military Strength

— Translated by 鑅

From Max Werner's work

"The Military Strength of the Powers"

Japan belongs to the category of "economically weak military states." Japan is not the "Prussia of the East" that it boasts of being, but rather the Italy of the East. It lacks raw materials and its industry is relatively weak. Because modern warfare relies on technological needs, a nation's military strength is ultimately determined by economic factors. An economically weak country can never become a first-rate military power.

Japan's economic system is undoubtedly insufficient in terms of supply. In terms of important raw materials such as iron, manganese, other metals, oil, rubber, cotton, wool, etc., it either has none at all or very little. Japan produces more than half of its copper needs itself, and can produce half of its zinc and iron needs. As for aluminum, tin, lead, and oil needs, it only has a small amount. Its steel industry cannot supply all of its wartime needs. During wartime, its iron needs must be supplemented by 20% of imports. The weakness of its heavy industrial base prevents it from developing into a strong wartime industry. In 1936, its steel production was 4.5 million tons, which is equivalent to between one-quarter and one-fifth of Germany or the Soviet Union's steel production. A booklet issued by the Japanese military stated: "On the eve of this war, we should pay close attention to the impossibility of building a wartime industry. Our current production capacity cannot even meet our general needs."

Another Japanese newspaper stated: "Japan's industry has a distorted development; light industry is progressing, but heavy industry is still in a miserable state. From a military point of view, this is indeed a relatively dangerous situation." (See Eilions du Correfeur) In the book "Japan is Preparing War" published in 1936, pages 285 to 6)

The most important problem in Japan's combat strength lies in its weak mechanical industry and formal wartime industry. The immature development of the mechanical industry shows an insurmountable fundamental difficulty in attempting to greatly develop the wartime industry.

Compared with the powers in this regard, Japan's industry is weaker and less skilled than any other country. It is the only country among the powers that even needs to purchase a considerable amount of military supplies from abroad during peacetime. Japan's wartime industry and mechanical industry are much worse than Italy's, although Japan's heavy industry is slightly better than Italy's. Japan's mechanical industry and wartime industry are comparable to Poland's, but Poland's aircraft industry is qualitatively stronger than Japan's.

Based on the production figures from 1934 to 1936, within the first 18 months after the start of a first-class war – say, a war with the Soviet Union – Japan would have to purchase a considerable number of positional warfare cannons and anti-aircraft guns from abroad.

Japan's production of counter-offensive weapons used in modern warfare is very lacking. The industrial base required for mechanized units is also very weak. Japan's automobile manufacturing industry is very backward, producing only a few thousand cars per year. In 1936, the production plan announced by the Toyada Motor Company was 4,000 cars and trucks. The production capacity of tank factories cannot exceed 3,000 vehicles per year, which means that Japan can never simultaneously deploy 1,000 tanks on the battlefield during wartime. For any number of tanks exceeding this amount, it would have to purchase them from abroad. The situation with aircraft is similar. Japan can produce at most 5,000 to 6,000 aircraft per year, which means that it cannot have more than 1,000 usable aircraft at the same time. During wartime, the production of aircraft must increase by an average of four to six times the number already in use. In this regard, Japan will therefore have to rely on imports for supply.

In terms of the offensive weapons of modern warfare, the true strength of the Japanese army cannot be calculated. As for the large-scale applications planned strategically by the Soviet Union and Germany, that is even more out of the question. In addition, Japan's economic system will be threatened from two sides during combat: one side is being blockaded by the navy, because the Soviet Union's submarine power in the Pacific Ocean is very strong (believed to be much stronger than Japan's); the other side is encountering air raids, because it is now very obvious that after the start of the war, the Red Army can immediately unleash a very strong power in the air. Both of these aspects are very possible and can easily prove the fate of Japan's fragile economic system.

When German officials and semi-officials did not need to worry about future alliances, they unhesitatingly expressed their doubts about Japan. In a first-class war, exactly how many opportunities Japan has is something that very accurately sees the fragile side of Japan's economic system. In 1934, when the Soviet Union's efforts in military progress had not yet been fully noticed, the German "Mililar.Wochenblatt" declared: "During wartime, Japan's political and military opportunities cannot be as favorable to Japan as they should be. When a Japanese-Soviet war breaks out, the result may be the collapse of Japan's economic system, and likewise the collapse of the Japanese army, because present-day Japan has absolutely no hope of achieving self-sufficiency in economic wartime supply." (October 25, 1934, "Militar.Wochenblatt." On October 10, 1937, when the Sino-Japanese War was already underway, the "Erankforterzeitung" said: "Apart from Prine Konoe (Konoe) himself and his economic advisors, no one has pointed out the fragility of Japan's military-economic foundation, which is the result not only of difficulties with raw materials, but also of the insufficient productivity of Japan's industrial tools. The "conflict" between China and Japan provides new proof every day that the Japanese economic mechanism, especially in heavy industry and formal military industry, is very inconsistent with Japan's world political position and its great ambitions."

In a first-class war, Japan has no hope of producing anything in its industry except some fairly well-prepared rifles and machine guns. The production of artillery, tanks, airplanes, etc., even if estimated according to the ordinary standards set by the Japanese army itself, is limited. When the Soviet Union's efforts in military progress had not yet been fully noticed, the German "Militar.Wocbenblatt" declared: "During wartime, Japan's political and military opportunities cannot be as favorable to Japan as they should be. When a Japanese-Soviet war breaks out, the result may be the collapse of Japan's economic system, and likewise the collapse of the Japanese army, because present-day Japan has absolutely no hope of achieving self-sufficiency in economic wartime supply." (October 25, 1934, "Militar．Wochenblatt" On October 10, 1937, when the Sino-Japanese War was already underway, the "Frankfurter Zeitung" said: "Apart from Puice Bonoe (Konoe) himself and his economic advisors, no one has pointed out the fragility of Japan's military-economic foundation, which is the result not only of difficulties with raw materials, but also of the insufficient productivity of Japan's industrial tools. The "conflict" between China and Japan provides new proof every day that the Japanese economic mechanism, especially in heavy industry and formal military industry, is very inconsistent with Japan's world political position and its great ambitions." The difficulties that the Japanese army will experience are not only the result of its fragile economic system. The manpower required by Japan for war is much less than the general needs. The number of trained reserve soldiers in Japan is relatively small, ranging from two million to two and a half million. The number of Japanese regular troops is about 320,000, which is slightly stronger than Poland's peacetime army.

Although Japan's population is three times that of Poland, according to an estimate by a Soviet military expert, only one-fifth of the population can be relied upon for military service, which is being conscripted and trained. The reason for this is the result of the military reform plan implemented from 1923 to 1925, which reduced a considerable number in quantity. The purpose was to reduce the quantity and seek to improve technical strength. The decision was to expand armaments and raise the standards of modern combat weapons in order to compensate for the deficiencies in the technical backwardness of the army. But in reality, the Japanese army could not reach the standard of European armaments, and its strength was greatly changed. Although Japan's population has increased, its number of trained reserve soldiers is only half that of France. In order to meet the needs of wartime, it is necessary to mobilize a large army. Japan must exhaust all the trained reserve soldiers that can be mobilized. According to the estimates of foreign experts (German and American), Japan needs to dispatch 1 million to 1.2 million personnel to the front line - to attack the Soviet Union on the Mongolian border and the coastline. At the same time, a considerable number of troops must be left in the country, and another part of the team must occupy North China and Manchuria. Therefore, it is very clear that as soon as the war starts, Japan will almost need to use all of its trained reserve soldiers. Therefore, fighting the Soviet Union will cause Japan to feel a huge threat of manpower shortage from the very beginning.

### Japanese Troops in Guangdong Attempt to Invade Lubao from Sanshui. Artillery Fights Break Out Between the Two Armies in Sanshui. Fierce Battle on Luxi Highway in Lucun for Four Days.

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese troops in Guangdong Province still maintain a defensive posture in the northeast and the two rivers. The Japanese troops in the Jiangmen-Xinhui area are also only trying to hold on. Only in Sanshui and other key areas of the West River do they constantly send teams to spy. Therefore, artillery battles often break out on both sides of the West River in Sanshui. The Japanese troops use shallow-water warships to fire cannons to cover the invasion of Chinese army defense areas by speedboats. The Chinese army's mechanized units have already been deployed to the front line to prevent the Japanese troops from crossing the river. Whenever the Japanese troops approach the shore, they immediately fire cannons to inflict heavy casualties. Every time the Japanese troops try to cross the river, they suffer losses. If too many troops are used, the Japanese troops do not have the strength. If there are too few troops, it is like scratching an itch. When the Japanese troops initially occupied Sanshui, they took the opportunity to break into the lower Legang and Zaogang areas in Mafang on the north bank. Later, the Chinese army believed that the terrain was strategic and transferred some elite soldiers to cooperate with a certain special unit to counterattack, and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese troops for three days, and finally wiped out the Japanese troops in the Zaogang area. At this point, the Chinese army's front-line position on the front of the West River was as solid as a rock. The Japanese troops believed that the fortifications in the area were solid and difficult to cross, so in recent months, no Japanese cavalry have been seen near Mafang. Jinliwei, the south bank of the Xijiang River across from Sanshui, has long been coveted by the Japanese troops. Before the invasion, Japanese planes were sent to bomb Jinli, causing the destruction of three-tenths of the shops in the area. After the Japanese planes ravaged, 500 Japanese troops were sent to cross the river from Sanshui. The Chinese army in Jinli calmly waited for half of the Japanese troops to land before suddenly launching a counterattack. In this battle, almost all of the Japanese troops were wiped out. A few remnants were covered by Japanese planes and escaped on boats. At present, the Japanese troops' reliance on the strong waves of speedboats is not as urgent as it was a few months ago.

Recently, the Japanese troops in the West River changed their offensive strategy due to their lack of success. They targeted Lubao, which belongs to Sanshui, as their offensive target. Lubao is located north of Sanshui. By crossing Lubao, they can go upstream to Xujiang, raid Qingyuan, and cut off the communication line between the Chinese armies in the West River and the North River. Therefore, although Lubao belongs to the left wing of the West River, its situation is important. The Japanese troops occupied the southwest of Sanshui, and there is a highway that can lead directly to Lubao, named the Luxi Highway. Also, you can reach the Xujiang Estuary of Lubao from the waterway from Sanshui. However, there are elite Chinese troops deployed on both land and water. Recently, the Japanese troops have continuously attacked Lubao from both water and land. Once, the Japanese troops used more than a thousand infantry and cavalry, aided by the air force, and launched a fierce attack along the Luxi Highway, and occupied Lucun, a key point near the road, with great momentum. For strategic reasons, the Chinese army transferred to a new position and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese troops for four days. Villages in the northern Sanshui area were turned into war zones. Later, the Chinese army's mechanized units arrived and counterattacked in one go, and finally defeated the Japanese troops who had invaded Lucun, causing them to collapse. In this battle, the Japanese troops lost many heavy cannons and suffered more than a thousand casualties, which was the second major blow since the Japanese troops occupied Sanshui. At that time, in order to prevent Chinese army reinforcements, the Japanese troops in Lucun sent a partial division to attack Yangmei along the Jiangkou by boat. The Chinese army had expected this move from the Japanese troops and used an elite unit to fight back. As a result, the Japanese troops not only failed to cut off Chinese army reinforcements, causing Lucun to be lost and regained, but also had several speedboats sunk by the Chinese army near Yangmei, which was also something that the Japanese military authorities did not expect.

### Japanese Troops in Suzhou Build Barracks. The Location is Near Guangji Bridge.

Suzhou Correspondence: The Guangye Unit of the Japanese Army in Suzhou has now selected a 36-mu empty lot in a certain surname's ancestral hall next to the Huayuan Hotel at Guangji Bridge outside the Ge Gate, and plans to build barracks. On the morning of the 15th, they held the so-called groundbreaking ceremony. During the ceremony, two Japanese people playing the role of Shinto priests chanted Shinto mantras in Japanese, held evergreen branches with white paper attached, and spread wine and food spirits all over the ground, murmuring non-stop. Finally, Guangye and Yongjing used small hoes and small shovels to break ground. According to Guangye, wherever the Japanese army is stationed, the Japanese military has already decided that barracks must be built one after another so that the Japanese army can be permanently stationed. The Suzhou barracks are being undertaken by Japanese engineer Xiben, and are scheduled to be completed by the end of November.

### Four Japanese Planes Bomb Taixian, Killing and Injuring More Than Twenty Civilians. Japanese Troops in Rugao are Repelled.

Taixian Correspondence: At 2:01 pm on the 14th of this month, one Japanese fighter plane and three bomber planes suddenly flew in from the southwest of Taixian City. They dropped six bombs at the Xiaocai Square, Zhonglou Lane, and the riverside of the County Government Park outside the North Gate, killing and injuring more than 20 civilians and destroying dozens of houses. A quarter of an hour later, the Japanese planes fled to the southwest.

On the morning of the 13th, 30 to 40 Japanese troops from Rugao went to Lujia Ferry to patrol. After the Chinese army opened fire to counterattack, the Japanese troops fled in panic towards Rugao City. Before long, more than 200 Japanese troops were dispatched from Rugao City in an attempt to attack the Chinese army's position. At the same time, Japanese troops opened dozens of artillery shells from the North Gate Yangqiao intersection automobile station and the Sanlimiao artillery forts outside the West Gate to demonstrate. The Chinese army calmly responded. Only one bomb landed in Balidian, killing and injuring seven or eight civilians. At about 8 o'clock, the Japanese troops retreated. At 12 o'clock in the morning, another 70 to 80 Japanese cavalrymen attacked the Chinese army's position in Qilique. Contact occurred between the two sides and stopped after about an hour. As a result, three Japanese cavalrymen were killed and two Chinese soldiers were injured. The Japanese troops retreated to Rugao City at 1:30 pm.

The Kunshan Puppet Government Sets Up a Puppet Public Property Office. Fang Zhongjing Serves as the Puppet Director.

Kunshan Correspondence: Wang Youzhi, the puppet magistrate of Kunshan, spared no effort in exploitation. In addition to collecting land taxes, he also opened up new avenues, restoring the Public Property Office, and appointed Fang Zhongjing and Gu Jianxia as puppet directors and deputy directors. The number of public properties in Kunshan is very large, and the annual income is considerable. The puppet magistrate has long coveted this, but has no one familiar with the content and has no way to ask about it. Now that he has the assistance of Fang and Gu, he will restore the Public Property Office and start collecting land rent. Since Kunshan suffered from the ravages of war, the four townships have been deserted, and the crops have been abandoned in the fields. Moreover, the villages along the road have all become ruins. The farmers' homes have been destroyed, and they cannot engage in cultivation again. Therefore, last autumn, there was no harvest at all. Now, the puppet county government is using the puppet Public Property Office to collect rent from the farmers. Those who cannot pay will be arrested, and the proceeds will be pocketed. Therefore, the people are very resentful.

The Atmosphere of Poison in Zhenjiang is Extremely Strong. Vagrants and Local Bullies Specialize in Selling Drugs. There are More Than Ten Government-Licensed Tobacco Shops in the City.

Zhenjiang Correspondence: Since the provincial capital was occupied, the Japanese have successively sent a large number of vagrants and geishas, ​​ostensibly to help the puppet organization and promote local prosperity. At present, in the main streets of Zhencheng, in addition to Japanese soldiers, Japanese men and women in kimonos and wooden exhibitions can be seen everywhere. According to investigations, the number of overseas Chinese in Zhenjiang has reached two hundred and several tens. Most of them opened dental clinics, watch repair shops, and photography studios (ie photography rooms), and secretly also engaged in the sale of opium, morphine, red pills, and various drugs. The vagrants also colluded with local hooligans to open theaters and brothels, such as the Zhongshan Bridge National Cinema, the Zhenjiang Grand Theater on Zhonghua Road, and the Osaka No. 1 Building (Japanese brothel) on Zhengbei Road. They arbitrarily occupied residents' houses, or demolished the houses and rebuilt them on the land. They also forcibly seized a large number of foreign pine wood from the Zhenjiang British Merchants' Xiangtai Timber Company for use as building materials. The company sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese, but it was ineffective.

According to current investigations, there are fifteen government-licensed tobacco shops in Zhenbu, and there were more than fifty smoking places in front of the shops. Now, nearly a hundred have been added. Street corners are full of red characters or gold characters "×× Smoking Place" store signs. The puppet newspapers also openly publish bizarre advertisements such as "×× Smoking Place, female reception, particularly comfortable." In order to encourage people to smoke opium, the puppet government even reduced the short-term license fee for smokers, stipulating that each ticket costs five cents and can be smoked for one month.

The Horn Stone Opposite Shantou is Fortunately Safe and Sound. Another World in the Beacon Fire of Linghai.

Shantou Correspondence: The Horn Stone opposite Shantou is compared by some to Gulangyu in Xiamen, one sea mile away from Shantou. The Horn Stone Mountain is a great building of the American church with green tiles and red walls, combining Chinese and Western styles. There is a Horn Stone Boys' and Girls' High School each, each occupying a mountain peak. Between the two mountains, there is a new-style cement stone bridge to connect them, which is the only way for students of the two schools to get to class. The bridge is seventy feet long, passing through the air. Under the bridge is a mountain ditch with民居 of varying heights. Every day, the sound of bells can be heard, and residents can also look up at the lively students going to class on the bridge. To the left of the mountain are Yishi Hospital, Women's Home Economics Institute, Mingdao Women's Theological Seminary, Kindergarten Normal School, Boys' and Girls' Higher Primary School, etc. This place is the birthplace of Christianity in eastern Guangdong. The 70th Anniversary Hall of the Baptist Church is located on the hillside. The Boys' Theological School is also located here. There are about 3,000 men and women from various counties studying here. The nearby villagers are all influenced by Christianity. Every Sunday, they gather in the church. The scenery is beautiful, clean and quiet, like a paradise.

The Horn Stone has this special advantage. People from all countries have built houses by the sea, such as the British Consulate, the Tax Office's official residence, 洋行 residences, doctors' dormitories, and foreign领事別邸. Most of them gather here. There is a police station there to maintain law and order. Since the July 7th Incident, the Horn Stone is neither a military key point nor has any equipment. There were rumors that the consuls of various countries stationed in Shantou had negotiated with the Japanese in Hong Kong and designated the Horn Stone as a neutral zone. The civilians passed on the message, and they regarded the Horn Stone as a safe area.

In the past, whenever the situation in Chaozhou and Shantou was tense, the Horn Stone Mountain Village would increase its prosperity. At present, the houses in the village have been rented out. A two- or three-方丈 building on the first floor costs more than twenty yuan a month in rent, almost exceeding the rent value of Shantou City. Even the bathrooms and kitchens have been rented out. The Wu Tian Village across the mountain ridge has also prospered with the Horn Stone. The British Consulate of Horn Stone is built at the foot of the mountain, and the fence spans the sea and the mountain peak, occupying the beauty of the forest, springs, water, and rocks. The area is 40 mu. In front of the consulate, there is a stone堤 extending into the sea, and a码头 is built to connect to the 堤. On both sides of the 堤, there are places for small boats to dock. Not far from the pier, there are often one or two British warships parked to protect the British consulate and British expatriates. On the pier, you can remotely view the Shantou Customs Inspection Factory and the oil merchants' warehouses of Qi Lu on the seaside. From the Horn Stone Middle School dormitory, you can see a panoramic view of Shantou City. At present, the suburbs of Shantou City are a vast ocean. The Chaojie ferry travels into the interior at night. Foreign ships enter Mayu Port, and all of them can be seen. As for the boats on the sea, coming and going day and night, like a leaf floating in the pond, the sparkling waves are dazzling, and the pine trees are refreshing, which is a great view of the corner of Linghai.

The Horn Stone schools are also ordered to evacuate and move to the interior, teaching classes in shifts. Only the employees of Shantou industry and commerce are temporarily living in the Horn Stone, going out in the morning and returning in the evening. It is heard that the population of the Horn Stone is about 20,000. From the Horn Stone, you can enter Chaoyang City. You have to travel eight li to Leikou and cross the river. You can also reach Dahao, Donghu, and Gezhou. After crossing the Lian River again, it is Haimen and Magao. The above-mentioned locations are 20 Chinese miles away from the Horn Stone, but the Horn Stone is surrounded by mountain peaks, forming a separate area. It is connected to the above-mentioned locations by only a very small mountain path. Throughout history, when the coast has been attacked, the Horn Stone has not been affected due to its special environment. Japanese planes have repeatedly dropped bombs or fired on the sea. When they pass over the Horn Stone on their way out to sea, they look down and scout, but they have not unleashed their deadly forces. Therefore, the Horn Stone is fortunately safe and sound.

### The Perfection of Marital Life: The Engine of Increased Health and Happiness

In the past, doctors were unaware of the root causes of neurasthenia and uterine diseases in women, as well as various venereal diseases in men. However, with the advancement of endocrinology of the reproductive glands, it is now deeply understood where the crux of these diseases lies.

A child who is castrated or has blocked vas deferens will not grow a beard, or will have very little of it, will have a high-pitched voice, and possess several personality traits different from ordinary men. Therefore, the endocrine secretions of the reproductive glands not only govern our reproductive functions, but also control our developmental functions in childhood. As for married men and women, they further govern the health and happiness of their daily lives. A pair of healthy and beautiful spouses, due to the intensity of their love, will inevitably have a fulfilling marital life. After a fulfilling marital life, part of the secretions of the reproductive glands in the body is indeed output through external ducts to mutually regulate their physical and mental well-being. At the same time, part of the secreted glands directly flows into the blood vessels, irrigating the whole body, thereby providing comfort to the mind and ease to the body, and the wings of sweet sleep will descend upon the beautiful couple. In addition, metabolism and other functions are enhanced, resulting in good digestion and smooth blood circulation. As long as they can maintain appropriate restraint and hygiene, their health will inevitably improve day by day, their love will be especially lasting, and giving birth to sons and daughters and organizing a happy family will bring such happiness! Therefore, it is said that a fulfilling marital life is the engine for increasing health and happiness, which is entirely a fact. However, the perfection of marital life must be based on health. If a man has committed masturbation and nocturnal emissions in his early years, or early marriage and indulgence, consuming too much of the secretions of the reproductive glands, then symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, spermatorrhea, incomplete development, thin sperm and infertility, and neurasthenia will abound. Such a husband, even with a beautiful wife like a flower, will inevitably find himself inadequate in marital life, which is not only unpleasant and deeply painful for himself, but how can a passionate wife be content with it? Therefore, discord in the bedroom, sadness leading to illness, or even divorce and elopement can lead to various tragedies! This not only destroys happiness but also damages health. To seek remedies, according to world-renowned doctors and my own experience, taking "Reproductive Gland Extract" preparations made from the reproductive glands of strong male animals is the most effective treatment for the symptoms. Indeed, after taking this preparation, it can generate sperm and tonify the kidneys, invigorate the brain and activate the blood, nourish the nerves within one day and night. It adjusts metabolic functions and promotes developmental functions. After taking it for a week, the above-mentioned symptoms will be cured in mild cases and alleviated in severe cases. If you continue to take it for more than a month, all symptoms will disappear and your body will become healthier. The famous German doctor Tameillsam, compared this preparation with other similar preparations. The results were that the quality of "Reproductive Gland Extract" is excellent, and its effectiveness is five to fifteen times greater than other similar preparations. It is also rich in positive and constructive tonic power. Regular use by the elderly and middle-aged can achieve the effect of rejuvenation. As for other similar preparations, they often have side effects of stimulating the nerves and stomach, and prolonged use is not advisable. If there is nocturnal emission, also take "Hemitol's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" (available at major Chinese and Western pharmacies in Wuzhou) to control leakage and achieve faster results.

### Nocturnal Emission Can Cause Premature Aging in Young People

— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Aging is an inevitable stage of life. Aging due to increasing age is natural; however, there are also people who, due to careful maintenance, do not show signs of aging despite their increasing age. These people are truly blessed. If someone is already showing signs of aging at a young age, or even shortening their lifespan, according to hygiene experts, this is their own fault! Originally, nature endowed them with aging at sixty and dying at eighty, but now they are aging at thirty and dying before their natural lifespan, is this not the utmost sin!

What causes people to age? The most common cause is the loss of reproductive glands, and the rate of aging is also the fastest. Young people who do not cherish themselves may commit masturbation during the period of spring arousal, and then suffer from nocturnal emissions due to masturbation or early marriage and indulgence. If nocturnal emission is neglected and left untreated, resulting in excessive consumption of reproductive gland fluids in the body, symptoms such as brain decay and forgetfulness, insomnia and excessive dreams, back pain, kidney deficiency and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and neurasthenia are inevitable. As a result, the face becomes sallow, muscles wither, the body and spirit are depleted, and although young in age, the appearance of old age is fully revealed, and even alas, they become short-lived ghosts!

A German medical scientist said: Nocturnal emission is a leaking source of our life force, and we must be alarmed and seek early treatment. According to the medical records of thousands of patients by world-renowned doctors and my own experience, the most effective treatment is taking "Hemitol's Sperm Consolidation Tablets." This medicine can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, and allow for restful sleep, reduce dreams, and stop nocturnal emissions on the same night. If the above-mentioned symptoms have already been caused by nocturnal emissions, it is necessary to also take the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductive Gland Extract" to nourish the brain and kidneys, sperm and blood, and nerves. After continuing to take it for half a month, you will surely be able to restore perfect health and prolong life. If patients can come to my clinic for electrotherapy and injections, a cure can be guaranteed.

Beauty and Health

### The Importance of Breasts in Beauty, Health, and Happiness

— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

No matter what you do, if you don't think about it from the root, you will eventually fail. Now, let's take the example of women's pursuit of beauty. Many women do not think about their own health, but only focus on decoration. What's the use of that? For example, a very young girl, because she is sick and in pain, loses her health, and loses the most valuable characteristic beauty of women - shriveled breasts, thin hips, and withered muscles - then even if she wears the most fashionable clothes, what moving curves can she have? Not only that, but because the clothes are too thin, the whole body outline looks even more ugly and contemptible! Therefore, when entering social occasions, she is often scorned by modern men, or given a cold laugh. Even taking a step back, in the private life between husband and wife, when the sweltering summer night comes and the "unveiling" show begins, this kind of strange shape with flat breasts, as soon as it enters the man's eyes, will undoubtedly drop the 120% enthusiasm from boiling point to freezing point, resulting in unhappiness, disgust in the heart, and creating various evils in the future. Isn't this a very common thing?

Based on the above, it can be seen that breasts are of great importance to women's beauty, health, and happiness. If unfortunately shriveled, one should seek to remedy it as soon as possible, and according to the results of experiments by famous Chinese and Western gynecologists, the most reliable method of remedy is universally recognized to be taking the ovary preparation "Reproductive Gland Extract" for women, which is the most effective treatment for the symptoms. The ingredients of this preparation are extracted from the ovarian essence of extremely strong animals and prepared by scientific methods, so the medicine is peaceful and has great effects. If you continue to take it, not only can it make the shriveled breasts gradually rise, the thin hips gradually become plump, but also adjust menstruation, eliminate all uterine disorders, invigorate metabolism, make the cheeks more radiant, enhance love between husband and wife, and prolong youth.

### Special Treatment for Gonorrhea with Redness, Swelling, and Pain

During the acute stage of gonorrhea, the glans and foreskin become inflamed and painful due to the irritation of the gonococcal toxin, which is a common symptom during the acute stage. The area around the patient's urethral opening will inevitably be red, swollen, and painful. The severity of these symptoms is always related to the intensity of the gonococcus. If the toxicity is strong, the lower part of the urethral opening, the two sides of the frenulum of the penis, and even the entire foreskin will be edematous and shiny. The swelling is accompanied by pain, but the fluid accumulated in this swelling is similar to hydrocele and is not pus. Since the condition has reached this point, the invasion of the bacteria has spread to the paraurethral glands, Littre's glands, and follicles. If these areas are indeed invaded by toxins, small to pea-sized swellings and indurations will occur in these areas, which can be detected by palpation. As a result, the urethral cavity is obstructed by these indurations and narrowed, making urination even more difficult.

To detect this condition, a new-style urethroscope should be used for a detailed examination to understand the true nature of the disease. Then, German lymphotropic electrotherapy is used to directly irradiate the gonococci in the lesion. Gonococci in the paraurethral glands cannot be eradicated by local surgery. Only lymphotropic electrotherapy can penetrate deep into the lesion. On the one hand, chemical therapy and specially made autologous vaccines are used as injections. In this way, all inflammatory and swelling symptoms will completely subside within one week, and the urethral indurations can also be eliminated and restored to their original state in two weeks. This treatment is the crystallization of my experience over the past ten years.

### Japanese Illegally Seize Over 200 Million Yuan in Customs Revenue

— By John Ahlers, Translated by Bo Ming for the Miller's Review

The Japanese authorities have been unilaterally implementing the current customs tariff rates in the occupied areas of China for a year now, as of June 1st of this year. On May 31st of last year, the internationally recognized 1934 Chinese customs tariff rates ceased to apply to the parts of China controlled by the Japanese army. The next day, the current tariff rates were implemented in ports north of Hangzhou Bay and in Xiamen. This Japanese-made tariff rate was subsequently extended to Guangzhou. This year, it was also implemented on Hainan Island and in other small ports in the Jiangmen and Humen areas of South China. Although Japan formulated and implemented this tariff rate, other foreign countries have tacitly acquiesced to its implementation. However, from the perspective of ineffective international law, this tariff rate remains illegal. Japan is acting in the name of the puppet regimes established by the Japanese army in China. These regimes do not possess the characteristics of normal governments and have not been recognized by any country, not even by Japan. The puppet tariff rate is merely a solo act supported by Japanese bayonets. Foreigners pay this tax not because they recognize it, but because they have no other choice. The 1938 tariff rate, as expected, greatly benefited the Japanese in China. With the assistance of the Japanese army, Japan used this tariff rate to gain the vast majority of foreign trade in the occupied areas. Before the war, Japan accounted for only about 12% of China's import trade. Currently, it accounts for more than 40% in all of China, about half in the Japanese-occupied areas along the Yangtze River (excluding the entire batch of smuggled goods), and about 70% in North China. This was recently stated by Japanese Finance Minister Ishiwata. A year ago, the Japanese claimed that their 1938 tariff rates were merely intended to restore the old 1931 Chinese tariff rate levels. However, they had to admit that the 1938 tariff rates implemented many exceptions that differed from the 1931 tariff rates. Most of these exceptions were applied to export goods that were particularly advantageous to Japan. The Japanese also asserted that this tariff rate equally considered the interests of all foreign countries. Today, foreign trade statistics books of the customs office prove that for most goods to which exceptions are applied, Japan either monopolizes their import or accounts for the vast majority of their import. Furthermore, the 1938 tariff rate effectively provided the puppet regime in Peiping under Japanese protection with weapons, which the puppet regime fully used to compete with the commercial interests of Europe and the United States in China. The Japanese seized the right to set tariff rates that legally belonged to the Chinese government and used this power to adopt numerous methods of controlling imports in North China. As a result, on March 11, 1933, export control conditions were promulgated, and Yokohama Specie Bank gained the greatest benefit from the new customs tariff rate. This benefit was the ability to control China's customs, use its income to invade China. Since Japan controls the coastal provinces, it is natural that most of China's foreign trade continues to be transacted in the Japanese-occupied areas. A large part of China's customs revenue is generated as a result. From June 1st of last year to May 31st of this year, 70-80% of China's customs revenue was generated in ports under Japanese control. The revenue for this entire year has been deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. The Chinese customs revenue currently held by this bank totals approximately 200 million yuan, half of which was generated in Shanghai alone. Japan still insists that it is not at war with China, while controlling China's most important source of income, which is certainly a most rare spectacle. It is also a rare spectacle that Japan does not hand over this revenue to the various puppet regimes that it claims are the legitimate government of China. But there is even more to be amazed at. Japan, which has no right to this revenue, brazenly occupies it by force and refuses to repay the bonds of Chinese foreign debts secured by customs duties, which are legally held by third countries. The number of these bonds is quite large, reaching more than 20 million pounds. Recently, it has been necessary to suspend the payment of their principal and interest, all of which is a direct result of Japan's seizure and use of Chinese customs duties. The use of Chinese customs duties to repay Chinese foreign debts secured by them enjoys a legally prior claim to other demands. Previously, these debts required an annual payment of 95 million to 100 million yuan. Since Japan controls about 70-80% of China's total customs revenue, it should repay 70-80% of the maturing foreign debt. To date, the customs revenue seized by Japan is double the debt, but the Yokohama Specie Bank has not allocated a single penny to repay Chinese foreign debts secured by customs duties. If the maturing debt were entirely reliant on Japan, it would have been suspended since June 1st a year ago. In order to maintain its own international credit, the Chinese government, although only receiving 20% of China's customs revenue, still fully allocated the funds needed to repay the maturing foreign debt secured in the past for nine months, only until February of this year, when Chongqing announced that it could no longer continue to strictly fulfill all of China's financial debts. In the past three months, the Chinese government has repaid the maturing debt in proportion to the actual customs revenue received. Even at that time, Japan still did not repay its 70-80% share, so a portion of the debt was suspended. If the debt secured by Chinese customs duties were only reliant on Japan, the debt would have been suspended long ago. Moreover, it is reported that the Japanese authorities have added many Japanese employees to the customs office, especially low-level employees. On the other hand, the customs offices in these ports have been forced to reduce their own salaries and expenses before handing over the remaining funds to the Yokohama Specie Bank. In some places, customs revenue is not sufficient to cover expenses and salaries, resulting in customs employees being owed salaries for a long time. Xiamen is one such place. The 200 million yuan in customs revenue deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank belongs partly to foreign holders of Chinese customs bonds and partly to the central government in Chongqing, but the Japanese handle these funds as if they belonged to the Tokyo treasury. The Japanese pretend that this money is kept in special accounts, managed and not used. In light of the unreliability of other Japanese guarantees, what the Japanese say raises questions. The Japanese have no precise accounts for these funds, and the Yokohama Specie Bank refuses to disclose its accounts and allow representatives of those who hold bonds for Chinese customs revenue to review where and how those funds are being managed. These two points clearly indicate that the Japanese have reasons to conceal the truth about these funds. In fact, Japan has never left this customs money untouched and uses it in various ways, the purpose of which is completely contrary to the legal nature and intended purpose of the funds. Most of the customs deposits in the Yokohama Specie Bank appear to have been partially lent out and partially spent. Japan uses Chinese customs funds for its own political, economic and military purposes through three channels: (1) The Yokohama Specie Bank has provided large loans to the puppet governments in Peiping and Nanking, with Chinese customs funds as "collateral." The funds that belong to the foreign bondholders and the Chinese government have thus been indirectly transferred to the irresponsible political puppets of the Japanese army. The Yokohama Specie Bank has profited handsomely from excessive interest rates, thereby repeating the famous Nishihara Loans transaction of 1918-19, except that the funds being lost are Chinese funds rather than Japanese ones. (2) The Yokohama Specie Bank uses Chinese customs funds to buy foreign exchange on the open market in Shanghai, thereby purchasing military supplies overseas to supply the Japanese army in China. This purchase of foreign exchange puts heavy pressure on the Shanghai currency market and thus helps Japan's policy of undermining the Chinese legal tender and extracting China's exchange reserves. (3) It is heard that the Japanese have seized Chinese customs revenue and directly used it to pay for their military expenses in China. There have been several examples of this. Japanese military and political spokesmen naturally deny this and call it a fabrication, but they should open the books of the Yokohama Specie Bank for the representatives of foreign bondholders with foreign debts secured by Chinese customs duties to thoroughly examine. However, the Japanese army will never allow this to happen. For this reason, the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement of May 1938 may have become one of the worst diplomatic blunders Britain has made in the Far East. Other powers who agreed to it, whether on the surface or otherwise, cannot escape blame. In the mid-19th century, when bandits rebelled, foreigners first acted as "custodians" of Chinese customs revenue. After 1900, when the Boxer Indemnity was implemented, the powers actually controlled China's customs revenue, with Britain in the leading position. However, the powers did not "abuse" China's revenue. After repaying the principal and interest of the debt at the old ad valorem 5% tariff rate, the remaining revenue was handed over to the Chinese government for its own use. After the Chinese government gained tariff autonomy in 1917, the government itself was responsible for repaying the principal and interest of the debt secured by customs duties and faithfully adhered to these debts. Today, it is for the first time in Chinese history that China has been forced to suspend its foreign debt secured by customs duties not due to its own fault. The agreement negotiated in Tokyo by Mr. Patzer, the economic adviser to the British Embassy in the Far East, paved the way for the implementation of the current tariff rate in the Japanese-occupied areas and the "custody" of Chinese customs funds by the Japanese. This agreement has not yet been fulfilled, but the Japanese have obtained all the benefits stipulated in the agreement to be given to them and have abandoned all their obligations. The British authorities agreed to Japan's control of customs revenue for two purposes: (1) to hope to maintain the integrity of the customs office established by the British and staffed largely by foreign personnel, so as not to cause division, and (2) the British authorities hoped to protect the interests of foreign bondholders, most of whom were British. Britain undoubtedly believed that taking measures with the Japanese could guarantee the integrity of the customs office. Other powers that advised their nationals to pay the tariff rate implemented by the Japanese undoubtedly had the same intention. The Japanese officials who negotiated with Mr. Patzer may have had similar ideas, but the inevitable has happened. The Japanese, under the pressure of their military, not only seized the revenue belonging to the recognized Chinese government and diverted it for their own selfish purposes, but also suspended the payment of maturing debt, thereby undermining treaties and international good faith. The authorities clearly did not realize in time that the negotiation of this agreement was a victory for the Japanese, who were able to use it to demand foreign consent to seize China's public revenue for private use. The Japanese portion of the Boxer Indemnity, totaling 300,000 pounds, had long been expected to be refused payment by China in the event of war between China and Japan and is now in a suspended fund at HSBC. On the one hand, China's refusal to agree to the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement was also expected. For these two reasons, we assume that the reason why the Japanese agreed to conclude the agreement and did not brazenly seize Chinese customs revenue, as threatened by their military authorities, was actually to use China's refusal to pay the indemnity as an excuse to justify their failure to fulfill the entire agreement. Thus, their act of brazenly seizing and illegally using Chinese customs revenue is no different from obtaining some kind of permission from foreign countries. This assumption seems logical.

### A Retrospective and Prospective View of the Sino-Japanese Currency War (Continued)

— An Shi

2. The Currency War in North China and the Defeat of the Federated Reserve Bank of China Notes

The Sino-Japanese currency war began in North China. Japanese economists were initially very optimistic about the currency war in North China. According to them, North China was within Japan's sphere of influence. At that time, the total amount of legal tender issued was about 140 million yuan, of which only more than 20 million yuan was circulating in North China. In addition, although there were banknotes from local and private banks, the number was small, only about 60 million yuan. There were very few legal tenders from the Central Bank and the Farmers Bank in North China, and most were from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, so it was easier to deal with. Moreover, the cash reserves of these legal tenders circulating in North China were actually kept at the Tianjin branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, rather than directly in the hands of the National Government. Therefore, the legal tenders in North China could generally be regarded as local currencies based on the economy of North China. If Japan wanted to issue new currency in North China, it only needed to expel the legal tenders from North China and separate the currency system of North China from the legal tenders. There was no need to eradicate the legal tenders completely. Thus, the Federated Reserve Bank of China notes were produced by them. However, no matter what oppressive means they used, the results of the Federated Reserve Bank of China notes were far from their expectations. In particular, the Federated Reserve Bank of China notes once fell to only 70% of the value of the legal tenders, and Japan was defeated in North China as soon as the Sino-Japanese currency war began.

This may have been an accident for them, but in our view, it was expected, because they underestimated the currency system in North China, just as they underestimated the economic power of the entire China before the war.

First, they thought that the circulation of legal tenders in North China was small, so it was easy to deal with. However, they did not know that the amount of legal tenders in circulation was determined by demand. The small amount of legal tenders in circulation in North China was entirely due to the economic situation and needs of North China, and not because the legal tenders did not have a solid foundation and influence in North China, as can be seen from the small amount of miscellaneous banknotes circulating in local private banks.

Secondly, the small amount exactly showed the prudence of the issuer, which in turn was enough to increase people's faith in the legal tenders. If the legal tenders had been over-issued and circulated in large quantities in North China at that time, it might have been very easy for Japan to overthrow them.

Thirdly, the legal tenders, no matter how the Japanese claimed, could still be used to buy foreign exchange, while the counterfeit banknotes and the associated Japanese banknotes could not. Therefore, it was simply a dream to try to drive out good money with bad money.

As for treating North China as a special area and separating it from the central government, this was a specialty of Japanese scholars, and we really have no need to argue against it. In addition, they made a big mistake, which was not (actually could not) consider the malignant inflation in their own country and linked the counterfeit banknotes to the Japanese yen. Before long, the failure of the counterfeit banknotes caused the Japanese banknotes to suffer a great disadvantage. In short, Japan was always defeated in the currency war in North China. To this day, the black market price of legal tenders in North China is far above that of counterfeit banknotes.

3. The Initial Currency War in Central China and Japan's Gradual Retreat

In the Sino-Japanese currency war, Japan was unsuccessful in North China and suffered a setback, so it had to be extra cautious in Central China.

In their eyes, Central China was the base of the National Government, its economic foundation was extremely solid, and its legal tender system was very strong. In addition, international interests were extremely complicated. Before the war, the circulation of legal tenders in Central China was about more than 100 million yuan. It was easy to talk about defeating the legal tenders in Central China. Therefore, opinions among Japanese scholars and politicians were divided on the currency war in Central China. However, in the initial stage, their claims and policies could be roughly divided into three stages:

(1) The Legal Tender Support Period

Shanghai and Nanjing fell one after another, and the Sino-Japanese currency war in Central China began. However, at that time, Japan was fully expecting "China" to surrender at its beck and call, and it was very difficult to defeat the legal tenders. Moreover, the legal tenders were good money that could be used to buy foreign exchange. Therefore, most Japanese scholars advocated (legal tender support theory) that in order to stabilize the financial world in Central China and consolidate the foundation of the puppet regime, nothing was better than actively supporting the legal tenders. If the legal tenders collapsed, the national economic strength of Central China would be destroyed accordingly. Not only would the puppet regime be hit, but the Japanese economy would also be adversely affected. Not only that, if the legal tenders were suppressed and their value plummeted, the result would inevitably be resentment from third countries, which would hinder the "construction of the New Order in East Asia."

This argument is really pitiful! We do not need to criticize whether the theory is right or wrong, because this is tantamount to Japan surrendering to the legal tenders without a fight. However, we must know that at the beginning of the war, the efforts of this faction were the strongest and were reflected in Japan's currency policy towards China: In the eyes of ordinary people, this seems a little unexpected, but in the eyes of people with a little economic knowledge, it is very ordinary and inevitable, because this pitiful cry is a reflection of the fragile and insecure economic foundation of Japan. In this way, in the first sound of the currency war in Central China, Japan unconditionally surrendered to the legal tenders!

(2) The Legal Tender Laissez-Faire Period

Japanese scholars had to advocate the "legal tender support theory" because they knew the fragility of their economic foundation, but this was a great contradiction. Because Japan was fighting with the National Government and was instead supporting the legal tenders it issued, making its economy more consolidated and helping its long-term resistance to succeed: This was really a farce. Therefore, before long, Japanese scholars retreated from the "legal tender support theory" to the "legal tender laissez-faire theory." Their claim was that the legal tenders should not be supported, but there was no need to destroy them. They should be allowed to take their natural course, and as a result, they would collapse and disappear due to the failure of the National Government's resistance.

This claim was very popular for a while. But in fact, it was no different from the previous one, but only fifty steps versus a hundred steps. Because no matter whether you support it or let it go, the legal tenders are ultimately good money with consolidated credit and can be used to buy foreign exchange, and will never collapse as the Japanese dream. Moreover, allowing legal tenders to circulate in the "occupied areas" is not helping the National Government to maintain the legal tenders? It is a credit to the Japanese that they can put on this half-sad and half-happy farce. But knowing that the economic foundation is fragile and the legal tender credit is solid, what can be done?

(3) The Legal Tender Utilization Period

The Japanese realized that it was not good to support the legal tenders, and it was not good to let them go. So, in the absence of a way, they came up with a way: the "legal tender utilization theory." The claim of this faction was that in the past, Japan had pulled "Manchukuo" and North China into the yen group, so Japan's exports to these places were not much different from domestic trade, and the trade that was obtained was adversely affected, because the exports to these places were not much different from domestic trade, and there was no benefit at all in obtaining foreign goods. In other words, Japan's export trade to "Manchukuo" and North China was of no help to improving Japan's international lending and borrowing. Therefore, this time, Central China should be excluded from the yen group, and the legal tenders should be used as currency, so that Japan's exports could obtain legal tenders through this route, and then use the legal tenders to hedge foreign exchange.

This faction's theory also had its merits, and Japan also adopted it as a policy. But it soon failed, because they did not think about the special situation of the yen in Central China. Because the over-issuance of yen and military notes in Central China had caused its controlled price of one shilling and two pence of Japanese yarn to fall to the same value as the black market price of eight pence of legal tenders, and sometimes even lower. No matter who it was, they wanted to get rid of this yen and military notes that could not be used to obtain foreign exchange as soon as possible. Therefore, Japan's trade with China in Central China was in fact mostly settled in yen, and the legal tender utilization theory also fell through. Not only that, in theory, using legal tenders to hedge foreign exchange has both destructive power on the one hand, and can also raise the value and status of legal tenders on the other hand.

In short, in the currency war in Central China, Japan had to admit the stability and value of the legal tenders from beginning to end, so in the currency war, it gradually retreated and unconditionally surrendered to the legal tenders. (To be continued)

### The Problem of Capital Dispersion Amidst Rising Prices

— Wu Zejin

The escalating prices in Shanghai have become the most serious phenomenon here. This publication previously urged scholars and experts to discuss and study the causes and stabilization methods in detail. Many gentlemen have expressed grand theories and insightful opinions, but few seem to offer concrete and practical suggestions and methods.

In my opinion, the high prices in Shanghai are caused by various factors, such as reduced production, decreased supply, concentrated population, and the establishment of the black market for foreign exchange. However, apart from these reasons, the significant expansion of currency circulation in Shanghai is undoubtedly one of the main reasons for the high prices. At the previous symposium, some gentlemen, especially Mr. Nie Guangdi, said, "The circulating capital in Shanghai after the war is not only less than before the war, but also seems tighter." This may refer to the situation shortly after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident. However, since the National Army's westward retreat, wealthy individuals from various places have concentrated in Shanghai, bringing large amounts of capital. The rapid increase in bank deposits after the war and the current atmosphere of prosperity and speculation in the market are clear evidence. Because the capital is concentrated in one place, it has created the current special prosperity, which has also led to the current high prices. Therefore, to stabilize prices, in addition to studying and addressing the other reasons mentioned above, efforts should be focused on how to appropriately disperse the surplus capital concentrated in Shanghai. As for the methods of dispersion, I see two points:

1.  The government should issue a type of short-term financial treasury bond designed to regulate Shanghai's capital, authorizing the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank to promote it. These four banks should use these treasury bonds to absorb general floating capital as much as possible, beyond the circulating capital actually needed in Shanghai. This method is not new. In 1934, Britain also used this method to solve its financial surplus panic at the time. However, in present-day Shanghai, this method faces difficulties. First, Shanghai is an occupied area, although there are concessions. It remains questionable whether the environment allows for the public promotion of government bonds. Second, the promotion of large-scale bonds can easily cause misunderstandings among the people and create doubt about the legal tender.

2.  Various banks should organize a large-scale syndicate to encourage and absorb the capital of wealthy individuals for planned internal relocation. The banks should provide guarantees with appropriate terms and interest rates for this capital, while the government should guarantee the banks' profits. This method can arouse the interest of general asset holders in investing in the interior. In the past, the main reason why their capital remained in Shanghai instead of moving inland was their unfamiliarity and uncertainty about the interior. Now that the banks guarantee profits, they will surely be happy to provide assistance. At the same time, the government's guarantee to the banks is also beneficial and harmless.

In addition, measures such as raising interbank deposit rates by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank to absorb idle capital from other banks, raising term deposit rates by various banks to reduce liquid current deposits, and refusing to lend funds to general speculators and hoarders are also ways to reduce floating capital and stabilize prices.

The above points are merely my personal views and cannot be considered suggestions. I hope those who pay attention to Shanghai's capital will conduct another detailed discussion and study. These are just for reference.

Commercial News

### ### The Food Market: Rice Speculation Heats Up; High-Quality White Japonica Rice Reaches $21.50

Yesterday, the highest price for Japonica rice in Shanghai even reached $22. According to rice merchants, the reason is that sources from various gangs, due to the closure of most areas in the interior by a certain party, and the absence of river cargo for a long time, and the recent news that Suzhou and other gangs are not sending goods, with only about a thousand packages from Changzhou and other places. At the same time, the extremely dry weather has greatly affected cultivation, leading to speculation by unscrupulous merchants. Whether retailers or hoarders, they are purchasing aggressively regardless of the high price. Storefronts are crowded with customers buying rice due to skyrocketing prices. To cope with the situation, stores are also trying their best to purchase supplies. Coinciding with Sunday, banks and warehouses were unable to release samples, resulting in a temporary shortage of supply in the market, pushing prices higher and higher. The price of Japonica rice, regardless of quality, increased by $1 to $1.23 compared to the previous market. The price of Changgao rice even reached $21.50, which was unexpected. Du Yangjian rice and Bopu rice followed closely, increasing by $0.60 to $1. Similarly, the price of silver dollars remained stagnant, with only a slight improvement of $0.20 to $0.30.

### ### Finance: Gold Is Expensive; Silver Is Also Expensive; $2.85, Still Unwilling to Sell

The spot market for gold yesterday was inactive due to the Sunday holiday, with no official prices. However, the off-market situation was largely cautious due to rumors that HSBC would stop supplying gold, which needed to be confirmed today. However, sentiment remained very firm. It was rumored that buyers who wanted to acquire gold had to offer up to $2,700 outside the customs (compared to the closing price of $2,680 the previous night). Jewelers were still exchanging gold ornaments at the Datong Bank at $270 per tael for sales and $262 for purchases. Also, a London cable on the 17th reported that the price of pure English gold had fallen by half a penny per ounce, totaling £7, 8 shillings, and 6 pence.

Silver has also risen following the surge in gold prices. Yesterday, buyers offered $2.85 (per tael), but sellers were still unwilling to supply. However, Datong Bank's exchange rate for standard silver remained at $2.50. It is rumored that the discount on silverware has been raised by 10% to 20% to compensate.

A London cable on the 17th reported that silver market speculators were selling and guessing at buying, with the market flat. The near-term price of large silver bars continued to decline by 0.0625, while the far-term price remained unchanged. A New York silver cable reported that the spot price of American silver remained unchanged. A Bombay silver cable reported that the Indian silver market was weak, with the near-term price continuing to decline by 5 annas.

### ### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Resume Their Upward Trend

According to a London cable, the sugar market recently saw a slight increase of half a penny, with August prices at 6 shillings, 11 pence, and 0.25. The far-term price remained unchanged. The municipal association's planning board indicated a continued upward trend in the market. Spot prices for 24 coarse white sugar were $29.60 at the local warehouse and $29.40 at the foreign warehouse, both up by $0.40. Re-exported customs warehouse goods were traded at prices ranging from $21.20 to $21.60, with initial prices at $21.20 for 100 bags, then $21.30 for 200 bags, and finally $21.35 for 200 bags, with land cargo at $21.60, totaling 500 bags. Taikoo Car White rose by approximately $0.20, with eastern warehouse goods priced at $28.85 for 100 bags, $28.90 for 200 bags, and $28.925 for 50 bags, western warehouse goods at $29.10 for 100 bags, CW mark at $28.80, CX at $28.50, DY mark at $27.70, and HX mark at $27.50. Local cotton white sugar Zhen Ji No. 1 returned to $29, and the situation for national sugar became increasingly tight, with pure cotton red rising to $17, with 130 bags traded. 201 bags of ice flower green sugar from Hong Kong were offered at $16.70. 110 bags of soft and inferior quality green sugar from Nanjiang were also offered at $14.50. Over 200 bags of miscellaneous foreign sugar were offered at $17.30.

### ### Hardware: Black Iron Sheet Prices Are Strong, Sales Are Sluggish

The market for black iron sheets has been sluggish recently, with stagnant sales in various sectors. For example, local thermos bottle factories have experienced sluggish sales of their thermos bottles due to high prices, resulting in weak demand for black iron sheets. Other business sectors have also shown little interest in these goods. However, due to foreign exchange rates, prices have increased by $7 to $8 compared to previous levels, with 26-inch sheets selling for $28 per picul and 36-inch sheets selling for $32 per picul, all produced by Derby.

### The Transition of the Exchange Rate Stabilization Fund (Continued from the 17th)

— Sheng Mujie

In summary, direct or indirect purchases of foreign exchange in Shanghai by the Japanese is indeed a major pressure on Shanghai's foreign exchange market. According to estimates from Shanghai banking circles, nearly 4 million pounds of the stabilization fund have been used in Shanghai, of which 2.5 million pounds have been seized by the Japanese through financial or trade methods. (Note) This estimate cannot be taken as completely reliable, but maintaining the value of the legal tender on the Shanghai black market has actually become a method of attacking the legal tender.

(4) New Levels and Speculation on Restrictions on Sales

Therefore, the Stabilization Fund's temporary suspension of supplying foreign exchange, allowing the legal tender to naturally move to a lower level, is indeed a necessary measure. A Reuters cable on the 8th explained the reasons for the Anglo-Chinese Stabilization Fund's not assisting the legal tender: "The fund temporarily suspended assistance on the 7th to allow the exchange rate of the legal tender to better match the economic price and promote trade balance... A similar step was taken in June 1938, and the exchange rate was satisfactorily maintained at a price of 8 pence for 12 months. It is now believed that a new price has been obtained and can be strongly maintained." The question now is, what is the new level? How will restrictions be implemented in the future?

Based on market prices and the exchange rate quoted by HSBC, in my personal opinion, 6.5 pence for the pound and $16.625 for the US dollar are likely to be the new levels for the exchange rate of the legal tender. First, let's look at the closing prices in the market:

After the 8th, the market price stabilized. Let's also look at HSBC's quotation:

Also, after the 8th, it stabilized with slight movements. If the market sentiment were truly bad, it would not have stopped above 6.5 pence. At the same time, if the Stabilization Fund did not believe that this price had reached a better economic price, HSBC's quotation would not have stopped moving. Based on past experience, last year, the black market exchange rate fell from 14.25 pence to 8 pence, a depreciation of about 40%. Now, it has fallen from 8.25 to 6.5 pence, a depreciation of about 20%, for a total depreciation of about 60%, which is a very low level. Any lower would affect British and American trade with China, something the Stabilization Fund Committee is likely already aware of.

Secondly, regardless of the new level, if anyone applying for foreign exchange with one legal tender were given 6.5 pence, it would improve the trade deficit to some extent, but it would still be impossible to prevent Japanese arbitrage. Therefore, no matter how low the exchange rate of the legal tender is, or how cheap counterfeit currency is compared to the legal tender, the Japanese can always obtain valuable foreign exchange with worthless paper money. Therefore, once a new level is obtained, a new supply method must be implemented immediately. According to reports, after HSBC restricted the supply of foreign exchange to the black market, it continued to supply those with legitimate needs based on order forms. This restriction method is still inadequate. The new supply method should be based on the principle of meeting the most urgent needs without being indirectly exploited by the Japanese. Otherwise, even if one legal tender is worth one penny, the Japanese will still arbitrage. —June 10th—

### Male Infertility: Remedying It with Scientific Methods

— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

For Eastern peoples who have historically practiced a clan system, the primary purpose of marriage is to have children. If no children are born, divorce and other situations may arise. However, according to current medical research, the cause of infertility is not solely with the woman. Diseases such as gonorrhea and impotence in men can also impair reproductive function. Gonorrhea can cause inflammation of the testicles and epididymis on both sides, leading to a lack of sperm and preventing conception. Sometimes, even if gonorrhea is treated vigorously, it reduces the function of the youth glands that govern desire, leading to premature kidney deficiency.

Kidney deficiency is common in the elderly due to physiological reasons, resulting from a decrease in the excitability of the erection center. In young people, apart from excessive sexual activity and harmful masturbation leading to kidney deficiency, the main cause is early licentiousness and drug use.

After suffering from kidney deficiency, men often exhibit a state of mental unease, such as headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, back pain, and chest tightness. They often experience nocturnal emissions. There are also pathological manifestations in sexual activity, such as premature ejaculation and impotence, which ultimately constitute the main cause of infertility after marriage.

Our purpose in procreating offspring is to maintain the love between husband and wife, preserve family harmony, and enjoy family happiness. To achieve this, it is essential to enhance sexual function. If one suffers from the above-mentioned conditions (with irregular menstruation being the most common disease causing infertility in women), the feelings between husband and wife will ultimately not be able to blend harmoniously. However, the treatment of these diseases must be remedied with the latest scientific methods. Now that the damage to the youth glands from these conditions has been understood, the best treatment is to take "Vitaton," a male-specific preparation made from German testicular extract. "Vitaton" was invented by the German physiologist Dr. Müllen. Its ingredients are extracted from the testicles and ovaries of animals. It has remarkable effects on those suffering from premature aging, kidney deficiency, sexual dysfunction, and weak erectile power. It can nourish the brain, kidneys, and blood. Elderly people who take it can rejuvenate. The female version functions to regulate menstruation and promote conception, and it is suitable for all uterine diseases. It is trusted by doctors both in China and abroad and can be said to be an effective remedy for kidney deficiency.

Modern Medicine

### Gonococci Are Approaching Their End

— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Gonococci, which have been rampant for thousands of years, are now approaching their final end. This amazing new medical record should be entirely attributed to the German gonococcal master, Dr. Peter. Before Dr. Peter invented the effective gonorrhea drug "Sterinol," only chemotherapy and percutaneous sterilization therapy dominated the treatment field. However, we clinicians inevitably experience disappointment with these two therapies from time to time. Because chemotherapy has powerful side effects, although it has a temporary sterilizing effect, the gains do not outweigh the losses. Moreover, there are often unpleasant prognoses after taking it. As for percutaneous sterilization, as the name suggests, it only has a slight sterilizing effect on the mucous membrane. However, due to the fierce nature of gonococci, this weak sterilizing effect is like a drop in the bucket and offers no fundamental solution. Therefore, we clinicians often feel it is difficult to handle.

However, after the worst, there is finally the discovery of the drug "Clinon." After taking this drug, all cells in the body develop an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect within a few palmfuls. Therefore, wherever gonococci hide, the sterilizing effect of "Clinon" is also generated. Based on this principle, regardless of where gonococci are distributed in gonorrhea patients, they can be eradicated by this great sterilizing effect. For all gonococcal prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, cystitis, arthritis, and other symptoms, after taking "Clinon," the blood is examined daily with a microscope, and the gonococci invariably decrease day by day, while the phagocytic function of white blood cells increases. Thus, both new and old gonorrhea are completely cured in a short period. As for external medicine, men can simultaneously use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally. Women with gonococcal leukorrhea can use "Carle Sedty Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, following the instructions or diagrams for secret self-treatment at home, which is especially effective.

### Early Summer Therapy for Lung Disease

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

The weather in early summer is suddenly cold and suddenly hot. If one is not careful, the patient's body is easily affected, leading to the deterioration of lung disease. It can also cause complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and acute catarrh of the intestines. To prevent this, patients must be as careful as they are in the autumn, paying attention to changes in the weather at all times and preparing clothing. In particular, drug therapy should not be neglected. In addition to paying attention to health preservation at all times, lung disease patients should take the German lung disease-specific medicine "Pulmonal" daily to enhance their constitution and strengthen their resistance. "Pulmonal" functions to eliminate phlegm and relieve coughs. It can restore the damaged lung cancer eroded by pneumococci to its original state. Because its ingredients are excellent, it can be taken in all seasons. All those suffering from lung disease should pay attention to this.

### Super-Special Therapy for Treating Pathological Seminal Emission

— Dr. Zheng Ling, German Medical Doctor

Seminal emission can lead to the loss of essential essence and blood necessary for our health. For this reason, it is generally considered dangerous and worrisome. However, if it is physiological, the danger is less. Pathological seminal emission refers to the discharge of semen, where erection and ejaculation are not under normal conditions, but an unpleasant leakage of semen. Generally, it starts during sleep, and sometimes the semen is discharged without awareness until the crotch of the pants is wet upon waking. The time intervals vary, with some occurring once a week and others once every three days. If the frequency of emission is high, the health prospects are even more worrisome!

The cause of seminal emission is mostly due to excessive masturbation. Therefore, to treat seminal emission, one must cut off the bad habit of masturbation and then apply targeted therapy. Taking the French seminal emission-specific drug "Nairus Seminal Emission Pills" before bed is highly effective, because this agent functions to strengthen the seminal gate and calm the brain nerves, preventing erotic dreams after taking it. In addition, electrotherapy and prostate massage can also assist in treatment. However, if the patient's constitution is damaged due to seminal emission, or if they suffer from neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, etc., they should also take "Vitaton," a male-specific preparation made from German testicular extract invented by Dr. Müllen, because it has incredible benefits for nourishing the brain, kidneys, and blood. This is the most advanced supplement of modern times.

A Brief Discussion of Gonorrhea

### Differentiation and Treatment of Urethral Gonorrhea

— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

If the differentiation of gonorrhea is inaccurate, it can lead to misdiagnosis and dangerous situations.

Only extremely scientific methods can be used to avoid being misled by the changes in the disease.

The most important thing in treating gonorrhea is the correct recognition of the symptoms. The work of differentiation must be carried out with the utmost care. Considering posterior urethritis alone, one can see that my statement is not false. When gonococci invade the posterior urethra, there are many differences due to the individual's nature and environment. However, if a rapid and appropriate treatment is given when it is about to invade, the area of the bacteria can be prevented from expanding day by day, and various complications can be avoided.

In general gonorrhea, the gonococci multiply on the surface of the mucous membrane from the anterior urethra to the posterior urethra. Although they gradually expand from the front to the back, it is not right to say that the pus flows backward from the front to the back when lying down or when the genitals are erect, thereby expanding the area of the gonococci. In addition, there are many cases in which gonococci invade the posterior urethra due to the patient's lack of health preservation or the doctor's unskilled surgery. Therefore, patients must pay twelve points of attention.

To treat this disease, a precise differentiation must be made before one can cope with it with ease. However, treatment is quite difficult, because it is extremely difficult to differentiate gonococci in our anterior urethra without precise examination. In the past, Mr. Wang Yurun suffered from gonorrhea and had consulted many doctors and taken various medicines, all of which were ineffective. He sought treatment from me, and after using the two-cup test method and microscopic examination, it was known to be posterior urethritis. I immediately used German electrostatic therapy, while prescribing the gonorrhea-specific drug "Clinon" as an internal medicine to completely eliminate the gonococci hidden inside the urethra, which took about three weeks. It has not recurred in the past three years. Consultation hours are from 10 AM to 6 PM. Twenty numbers are given out each day, with a registration fee of only 5 cents per number. A copy of "The Complete Book of Venereal Diseases," worth one day's work, is also given as a gift.

### Rice Prices Surge Again Yesterday – Concessions Authorities Should Not Ignore – Price Increases Entirely Due to Speculative Manipulation – Rice Stocks Are Indeed Plentiful, and Supply from Various Regions Has Not Been Cut Off – – Unscrupulous Merchants Disregard the Livelihoods of Ordinary People and Should Be Severely Punished –

The price of rice in the Shanghai Bean and Rice Market has soared, reaching a new high. Rice industry associations have reported this to the authorities in the concessions, requesting them to promptly devise solutions, crack down on speculative manipulation, and ensure smooth supply, so as not to affect social stability and the livelihoods of citizens. Details are recorded as follows:

Rice Prices Soar – Reaching a New High

Due to speculation and manipulation by hoarders in the bean and rice market, large amounts of capital continue to pour in, causing prices to rise to unprecedented levels. After the market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday, trading was chaotic. Changshu Special White Rice rose to a new high of 21.7 yuan, and all other types of rice increased by about one yuan. The Market Management Committee has been strenuously advising customers not to engage in rice speculation, so as not to affect the overall food supply for the people. However, speculators continue to manipulate the market, preventing rice prices from falling. Moreover, many hoarders are from outside the industry, making it very difficult for the management committee. The situation has been reported to the guild.

Reporting to the Authorities – Proposed Solutions

The Bean and Rice Trade Association has reported the soaring rice prices and the manipulation of the rice market by speculators to the Public Concession's Public Works Department and the French Concession's Municipal Council, hoping that they will promptly take effective measures to: Crack down on speculators manipulating the rice market promptly; Ensure smooth supply from the inland to maintain the food supply within the concessions. Rice industry leaders have held informal discussions, believing that the rice industry association is powerless to deal with outsiders manipulating the rice market, and can only wait for the concession authorities to resolve the situation. At the same time, the Market Management Committee has been instructed to advise customers to sell within its power, to maintain the food supply.

Inviting Firms – Exerting Efforts to Advise

The Market Management Committee convened a meeting yesterday afternoon, advising 105 firms to maintain the food supply, stabilize rice prices, and ensure smooth supply. They also adopted indirect or direct methods to advise hoarders not to continue hoarding, so as not to cause rice prices to surge again. Although the firms have expressed acceptance of the advice, the effectiveness is difficult to predict. As for the rice arriving these days, although it has decreased significantly compared to before, the supply has not been completely cut off. For example, although the supply from the rivers yesterday was very limited, by both land and water routes, a total of 3,500 bags were transported from Changzhou and Kunshan, each bag containing one stone and five dou.

Rice Stocks Exceed 500,000 Bags

A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter specially visited a rice industry leader yesterday. According to him, the soaring rice prices were indeed unexpected, because it is now approaching the plum rain season, making hoarding extremely dangerous. The hoarded rice is easily moldy, so rice merchants within the industry would never dare to hoard. Outsiders, however, are unaware of the reasons and risk hoarding in order to make huge profits. According to investigations, current rice stocks within the Shanghai concessions, stored in various bank warehouses and warehouses, total more than 500,000 bags, with the Bank of China warehouses holding the largest number, followed by the Zhejiang Industry Bank, the China Industrial Bank, and other banks.

No Fear of Overall Food Shortage

As for the rice pre-purchased by residents, although it is impossible to investigate, it is estimated to be 400,000 to 500,000 bags. Therefore, there is no fear of an overall food shortage in Shanghai. The rice shortage situation of the winter of 1937 will not be repeated today. However, the soaring rice prices, approaching 22 yuan, are unreasonable. If speculative manipulation by hoarders can be cracked down on, the rice price in the market can be suppressed. Unfortunately, the rice industry association's power is insufficient and it cannot implement this. It can only hope that the concession authorities will intervene, otherwise, it is feared that rice prices will surge again.

Shanghai Merchants Build Warehouses in Haiphong – Tong Yi Shipping Company Warehouse Completed – Yuan Tai Lin Also Owns Customs Warehouse

Haiphong is now a major hub for the concentration of transshipped goods. The prosperity of cargo transportation is unprecedented. Therefore, in such a small area, goods awaiting shipment are piled up like mountains. Although the authorities are making every effort to ensure smooth passage, the lack of vehicles makes it difficult to achieve this in the short term. As for customs warehouse registration procedures, due to the customs' particular diligence, obtaining registration is also very difficult. Even Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire can only send their own Jianglun to anchor in Haiphong, as floating warehouses, to temporarily store incoming goods. The newly opened in this city

Tong Yi Shipping Company

was jointly established by Chinese employees of Wah Lun & Co., Tian Xiang & Co., and Zhongxi Shipping Company. Xu Lisheng and He Xiyu, two gentlemen of the company, are experienced in shipping and have extensive connections. Seeing the past difficulties in cargo transportation and customs warehousing in Haiphong, they specially entrusted Mr. Li Huo of Weitai & Co. to go to

Haiphong to Find Land

and build a huge warehouse. It has now been completed. In mid-last month and early this month, they continuously opened the Han Lan Li and Anshan ships, directly to Haiphong, carrying more than 8,000 tons of goods.

It is Said That Yuan Tai Lin

Branch, the head office is located in Haiphong, also has its own registered customs warehouse. Recently rented a Anlikai Ma Le ship, carrying a weight of more than 6,000 tons, for the sake of prudence, only limit the loading of 4,000 tons, from today to sign the customs documents, set on the 22nd closure, the 23rd direct release Haiphong,

### "Avenue" Police Station of Great West Road – British Troops Stop Blocking – British Troops Have Also Withdrawn Nearby – Police Department Negotiations Concluded

There is a police substation of Dadao at the intersection of Great West Road and Columbia Road in Shanghai, where puppet police are stationed. After the British military headquarters closed it down, the building was nailed shut, and barbed wire was piled up at the entrance to prevent re-stationing. Until the night before, several armed puppet policemen secretly entered through the back door and removed the barbed wire at the door. The British army discovered this and rushed to stop it. At that time, the situation at the scene was once tense, but fortunately, the police retreated and no accidents occurred. I went to inspect it yesterday afternoon and saw that the gate of the bureau was wide open and the interior had been cleaned up. There were several puppet police officers in the back, and all obstacles at the door had been removed. Judging from the situation, it seemed that they wanted to stay there for a long time. The English-language Da Mei Evening News said that the Public Concession Police Department and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" Police Bureau had concluded negotiations on the status of the "Municipal Government" police substation at the intersection of Columbia Road, Great West Road, yesterday (17th), with both sides satisfied. The British army has withdrawn from the vicinity of the bureau and allows the "Municipal Government" police to enter the building, stipulating that they must not act in front of the building on the road bordering the concession, and use the side door leading to the "Municipal Government" area for access during mobilization. Therefore, the barbed wire in front of the building has been removed.

Zi Lin Newspaper Said

The "Avenue" police station near Columbia Road, Great West Road, was ordered by the British military authorities to be barricaded in January. At 6:10 yesterday morning (17th), "Avenue" police sneaked in to open the door. Until late yesterday evening, British soldiers of the Dongxu Lai team were still stationed on the south side of Great West Road opposite the bureau. It is heard that the British military commander and the Japanese authorities have been negotiating since before yesterday evening in order to reach a compromise. Judging from the situation, the fate of the bureau may be peacefully resolved today (18th). It was found that the British army barricaded the front of the bureau in January.

When the British military authorities, who had a barricade to enter the Public Concession Road, heard the news, they sent

a squad of British soldiers

wearing steel helmets to station near the bureau and order the "Avenue" police to leave. No accidents occurred afterward. Until 1:50 p.m., two trucks carrying 60 "Avenue" police officers with rifles and pistols arrived at the scene and drove into the bureau. The British army then drove to the site again. After a British officer spoke with the Chinese "Avenue" police chief, the "Avenue" police retreated eastward

on foot

along Great West Road. At 3:00 p.m., Brigadier General Simmons, commander of the British forces stationed in Shanghai, also arrived at the scene and spoke with officers standing near the police station for several minutes before returning. At that time, two Japanese military photographers were busy taking pictures from a distance, especially of the sentries in front of the bureau and the four truckloads of British soldiers along Columbia Road. The reserve team of the Public Concession Police Department was also ordered to assemble at the Jing'an Temple police station to await orders, but were not sent to the scene of the incident because it was

not necessary to do so.

In the afternoon, barbed wire was unloaded from two military trucks, and 20 British soldiers wearing leather gloves re-erected the barricade, but the work was ordered to stop as soon as it began, and the barbed wire was removed. In the afternoon, Japanese officers in plain clothes and uniforms drove by the area several times in cars, but did not get out. At 9:00 last night, three British sentries were stationed on the other side of Great West Road. One foreigner and three Chinese personnel from the Police Department

were stationed in front of the bureau.

A camp was set up in an English garden on the south side of Great West Road, and the British soldiers stationed in Great West Road temporarily stayed in the tent. Although pedestrian traffic was not prohibited near the police station, there were very few pedestrians. A barbed wire barricade was erected at the intersection of the police station, but those living in the alleys could still enter and exit freely.

After three and a half months of mooring in Yantai, they will return to Shanghai and sail to the waters off the Philippine Islands for winter training. The 14th Destroyer Squadron is also docked in Shanghai and is expected to leave Shanghai for Yantai next week.

### Safety Campaign – First Day of Promotion Week – Awarding Truck Drivers with No Accident Records – Xinhua Company Filming "Safety First" Movie – Promulgating Eighteen Rules of the Road

The Public Concession's Safety Campaign Promotion Week began yesterday. Trams, buses, taxis, freight trucks, rickshaws, self-owned vehicles, bicycles, and other vehicles operating in the concession were uniformly pasted with slogans or banners. Mr. Pike, Assistant Commissioner of Police and Director of the Traffic Division, together with personnel from the Public Utilities Company and the two Concessions' Vehicle Affairs Departments, inspected various roads by car.

Scouts Set Off – Assisting in Directing Traffic

The authorities also invited storytellers to go to various crowded places to tell short stories, explaining the need to be careful when walking. They also invited older Boy Scouts, dressed in plain clothes and holding flags, to distribute leaflets with concise text at various road intersections, and to persuade pedestrians not to linger on the road to avoid accidents. This can create a foundation of safety, improve traffic conditions in this port, and reduce the number of accidents in the city. In addition, dozens of employees went to public places, teahouses, and restaurants to conduct propaganda. More than 400 students from public and private schools subsidized by the Public Works Department's Chinese Education Department set out, holding "Safety First" command flags, to assist in directing traffic and distribute leaflets on rules of the road at Nanjing Road, Beijing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Avenue Edward VII, and the Bund, and other major traffic arteries, advising pedestrians to pay attention to traffic safety.

Schools Hold Essay Contests

At the same time, the Academic Affairs Department was asked to issue a notice to all schools that teachers should teach a short "Safety First" course during this promotion week, and hold a short essay contest, judged by the teachers, and awarded by the committee. Chinese schools expanded their original lecture methods and studied safety issues. Western schools also added this type of course on a daily basis, and distributed tens of thousands of "Safety First" buttons to students to draw the attention of students' families.

Distributing "Safety" Commemorative Stamps

The association also asked truck owners to give bonuses to drivers with no accident records. The association also printed a large number of rubber stamps with the words "Safety First" and distributed them to various public utility companies and well-known commercial firms to stamp on all outgoing letters for widespread publicity and to achieve a grand effect. There were also announcements and statistical charts posted in the racecourse, dog racing track, and gas stations. At the same time, rickshaw groups and taxi groups dispatched personnel to guide the drivers.

"Safety First" Movie Premieres

In order to popularize the propaganda, the Public Works Department requested the Xinhua Film Company to produce a free "Safety First" film reel, directed by the famous director Bu Wancang. The film was donated by Kodak and Agfa. The film has been completed and was previewed at nine theaters, including the Da Guangming, yesterday morning, with more than 25,000 viewers. It will be distributed to various cinemas for simultaneous public release and printed with multiple copies, welcoming factories, schools, and public organizations to show it for free to facilitate publicity. Those who want to rent it, please call 10704, or go directly to BecK α Swann Foreign Company at 17 Bund and contact Mr. A. Pullen.

Public Works Department Formulates Rules of the Road

The Public Works Department has formulated the following eighteen rules of the road: (1) Do not walk on the road where there is a sidewalk; (2) Do not walk on the sidewalk edge in the same direction as vehicles; (3) When walking from the sidewalk onto the road, pay attention to whether there are vehicles coming and going; (4) When walking on the sidewalk, keep to the left; (5) If there is no sidewalk, walk against the direction of traffic, that is, keep to the right side of the road; (6) When crossing the road, look right first and then left to see if there are vehicles coming and going; (7) Cross the road straight, do not cross diagonally; (8) Be especially careful when crossing out from the front and rear of vehicles, or when there are obstacles blocking the line of sight on the road; (9) When crossing an intersection, cross when the vehicles on the cross street stop; (10) Do not rush across the road when vehicles on the cross street are about to come; (11) In an emergency, know that the safest place is in the middle of the road, do not rush to retreat; (12) Know that cars, bicycles, and rickshaws do not have a fixed route; (13) Do not call for rickshaws on the opposite side of the road; (14) Know that vehicles traveling at high speed cannot be stopped immediately; (15) When crossing the road, it is best to cross at an intersection controlled by traffic lights; (16) Use the refuge station in the middle of the road as much as possible; (17) Do not stop on the road, and be careful when turning; (18) Know that the road is for public use and anyone can use it.

### Foreign Ships Sailing to Ningbo – No Need to Apply for Approval for Each Trip – Still Need to Comply with the Measures for Sealing the Seaport – Passenger Transport Is Absolutely Prohibited, Limited to Loading Cargo

After the Ningbo Defense Command allowed Ningbo to resume navigation in order to facilitate cargo transportation, various foreign shipping companies immediately sent ships to resume navigation. However, they must apply for approval for each trip. The foreign ships sailing include Xin Beijing, De Ping, Ende, and Moufu. Now the Ningbo Defense Command has been ordered by General Liu, Commander-in-Chief of the 10th Army Group, to allow all ships that have been approved to sail to Ningbo in the past to sail freely without having to apply for approval for each trip. However, passenger transport is still prohibited, limited to loading cargo. However, if government officials and public servants have important official business that requires them to go to Shanghai, they will be issued a pass to board the cargo ships. As for those who have been approved to sail to Ningbo in the past, there are 11 routes including Shanghai-Wenzhou-Ningbo, Shanghai-Hong Kong-Ningbo, and Ningbo-Dinghai-Xiangshan, and 47 foreign ships including Nanchang, Ninghai, and Lisheng. All foreign ships sailing must strictly comply with the newly promulgated Temporary Restrictions on the Import and Export of Goods by Sea at Zhejiang Seaports. The Defense Department will notify the Shipping Association and the Customs Brokers Association.

### Two Concession Tram Companies – Already Using Tokens – Ministry of Finance Will Issue and Transport Vouchers to Shanghai for Remedy – Copper Coin Shortage Panic Expected to Subside

The lack of copper coins in the Shanghai market has caused difficulties for all industries. The public bus and tram companies in the British and French concessions have been using tokens since yesterday to facilitate passengers. The Ministry of Finance will issue vouchers for transport to Shanghai to remedy the copper coin shortage, so the copper coin shortage wave is expected to gradually subside in the short term. Details are recorded as follows:

French Tram Company Tokens

Trams and buses in the French Concession have found business difficult because they refuse to accept postage stamps. In order to remedy this, the company authorities have been using tokens since yesterday. These tokens are divided into one-cent and two-cent types, made of cardboard, with Chinese and English translations, and are only valid within the French Concession. The following is a notice from Mr. Viali, the company's Traffic Manager: "The company's one-cent and two-cent tokens are only valid within the French Concession. Each ticket seller can receive a maximum of two yuan, to replace the lack of legal tender, and should not give change arbitrarily unless absolutely necessary."

Public Concession Tram Company

Although the British tram company in the Public Concession does not refuse to use postage stamps after the copper coin shortage wave, it is more difficult for ticket sellers to sell tickets and calculate fares. Therefore, taking the same step as the French Concession tram company, it also issued two-cent and three-cent tokens yesterday. They are printed on thin cardboard, three-cent in light lake green, and two-cent in coarse rice color, which are easy to distinguish. The vouchers are printed with Chinese and English instructions and printed with red Arabic numerals "3" and "2". The Chinese "Three Cents" and "Two Cents" are in hollow characters. The bottom of the voucher is punched with a line eye, and the top is printed with a number. The company stipulates that these tokens can not only be used on the bus, but also be cashed at the company's office at 185 Suzhou Road.

Ministry of Finance Will Issue Vouchers for Remedy

All industries use postage stamps as small change in business, and because it has gradually become accustomed to over time, the panic is not as serious as at the beginning. It has been found that the problem of smuggling copper coins out of Shanghai occurred after the National Army moved west, so the government has long paid attention to this. According to silver industry news, the Ministry of Finance will issue vouchers for transport to Shanghai to remedy the copper coin shortage, so the copper coin shortage is expected to be eliminated in a short period of time.

Shipping from Shanghai to Funing to Open Soon

Shipping from Shanghai to Funing has been suspended since last winter, and it has been half a year since now. Goods in the area are piled up like mountains and cannot be cleared. It is now heard that the Shanghai De Yi Xiang Company has agreed with the authorities and has chartered the Greek ship Li Wu Duo, with a load of more than 2,000 tons, to sail soon.

New Spanish Consul Arrives in Shanghai

The Spanish Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Fei Lianlai, is about to step down and return home. The post of new Consul General has been filled by Mr. Yu Er from the Spanish Franco government, who has arrived in Shanghai for some time. Mr. Yu is a famous Spanish aircraft pilot, and is particularly good at driving locomotives.

### Foreign Trade – Barter Pays Off – Tea for Soviet Union, Tung Oil for US – Major Exports Can Utilize New Transport Lines

Since the trial of barter trade in foreign trade, it has been quite effective. As a result, China's tea exports to the Soviet Union have surged, all concentrated in Hong Kong for export. From January to April, tea exports from Hong Kong to the Soviet Union were 19,903,258 pounds, with a total value of HK$8,227,774, accounting for more than 80% of the export amount. In addition, the export volume of raw silk, tung oil, hog bristles, casings, and fur has not decreased sharply due to the war. It is heard that the barter method will be gradually promoted. It is now being implemented with tea in exchange for Soviet goods and tung oil in exchange for US goods.

Allocating Ten Million to Promote Production

After the Executive Yuan issued an order to all provinces to promote production and instructed the competent authorities to allocate funds, it was decided to allocate 10 million yuan from the competent authorities for the development of inland production. Guangxi, Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangxi, and Yunnan were designated to improve seeds, promote sideline industries, prevent and control pests, study water conservancy, and reclaim wasteland in agriculture. In industry, they would improve technology, promote national goods, promote small industries and handicrafts, develop mining and metallurgy, and revitalize rural finance, and improve the organization of various industries.

Concentrated Exports for Foreign Exchange

Since the Trade Commission implemented export management, it has assisted in exports worth no less than tens of millions of yuan, and concentrated foreign exchange exports of nearly tens of millions of yuan. The tea, oil, and silk stored in Hankou, as well as the silk and tea in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, have all relied on the commission's efforts to clear and rush transportation to reach Hong Kong for foreign exchange. Other coordination of transportation and purchase of materials from various provinces has also been quite successful. Recently, it has also increased the handling of barter trade with a certain country, and its business has therefore developed further. It is expected that the value of managed exports this year will be even greater than in the previous two years.

Opening New Routes to Promote Trade

After the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Shanghai, foreign trade was concentrated in Guangdong and Hubei. After the withdrawal from Guangdong and Hubei, foreign exports were able to be shipped out via Haiphong, all thanks to the encouragement and assistance of the central government. The sharp increase in trade volume in various customs areas in the rear and the continuous increase in the export value of certain commodities could not have achieved such good results without the intervention of the Trade Commission. Recently, the central government accelerated the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway and newly established a certain company, which is a good phenomenon in the war of resistance and nation-building.

Collection Methods for Wartime Taxes – Exempt in Combat Areas – Normal Collection in Areas Close to the War Zone

Since the outbreak of the war, the Ministry of Finance believes that the war zone is expanding day by day, and the tax burden on the people in the war zone and areas close to the war zone should be appropriately reduced and exempted to show compassion. It specially issued an order to all provinces and cities: A. All taxes should be abolished in the combat area, and the people in the area should be advised to refuse to pay any taxes collected by any party; B. Various local taxes in the combat area should be postponed, reduced, or exempted, and the competent authorities of each province should decide separately based on local conditions, and order the financial authorities in the area to implement them. The collection and location should be made as convenient as possible for the people, and the military should be strictly prohibited from directly collecting taxes, apportioning taxes, or illegally requisitioning them from the people; C. All legal local taxes in areas close to the battlefield should still be collected as usual, but excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes must be completely abolished, and apportionment and illegal requisitioning must be strictly prohibited. The above measures should be used to set up a wartime economic commission according to the same plan for research at any time.

### US Fleet Commander Goes to Tianjin – Denies Having a Mission – Will Stay in Tianjin Briefly and Then Go to Qinhuangdao – People Believe He Will Investigate the Situation There

The Mainland News said that reliable news was received here last night (17th) that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the US Asian Fleet, who is currently touring in Beiping, is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin by train on the 20th of this month. Local US naval authorities do not recognize the Japanese claim that Yarnell will go to Tianjin by warship or that there is any special significance. It is said that Yarnell had scheduled his trip to Tianjin before the British and French concessions were blockaded. The American expatriates in Tianjin originally planned to host Yarnell at the American Chamber of Commerce, but because of the Japanese blockade, the procedure has been changed, and he will be entertained at the YMCA on the Outer Racecourse Road in the British Concession. It is heard that Yarnell will stay in Tianjin for one or two days, attend the reception, and then take the train to Qinhuangdao, where his ship Augusta is currently docked, but people believe that Yarnell will take advantage of his trip to Tianjin to directly investigate the situation there, as it is related to the American expatriates in Tianjin.

###梵王渡頭　Visiting Mr. Bu Fangji (Part 1) NC

Before the record of my visit to Mr. Bu Fangji on the island, it is worthwhile to revisit old dreams from more than ten years ago with a childlike heart.

More than ten years ago, Shanghai's two highest institutions—St. John's and Nanyang—always had several football games every winter. The spectacle was like that of Harvard and Yale. Not only the alumni and students of the two schools came to cheer, but people from society also took it seriously, making time to travel far to watch. I remember one year, about two weeks before Christmas, we took turns to go on a long journey. We ate an early lunch, formed a mighty team, and headed west along Hongqiao Road, straight to Xujiahui Station. One by one, we boarded a special train. Half an hour later, our Nanyang cheering squad was already roaring on the football field across the river from St. John's.

This time, in extreme danger, we won a goal. Everyone was ecstatic, hats flew in the air, and the passionate mood still lingers today. I also remember that on the way back, I walked with two classmates, not taking the train. We turned from Yidingpan Road to Xujiahui Road—now Haig Road. We talked and laughed all the way. The winter twilight was especially lovely. From the distant woods, we saw a few streaks of red clouds. In order to enjoy the evening scenery, we didn't feel tired at all.

Of course, St. John's also often won against us. Their students also returned home happily, stepping in a long line.

The most memorable thing in life is the past. Today, standing at the gate of St. John's University, these past events evoke endless melancholy! What about our alma mater?

The trees along Yuyuan Road appeared particularly lush green in midsummer. The road was smooth and lovely, and the car sped along without any unusual feeling. Turning a corner, nearing Shanghai West Railway Station, the scene changed drastically. Flags fluttered in the wind, and the houses were incomplete and dilapidated. I was really afraid to look, and I really didn't want to look out the window. Fortunately, this short stretch of road disappeared in just three minutes. Turning another corner, quietly and windingly, a small road covered with green shade appeared in front of us. At the same time, I saw the Suzhou River again, as if meeting an old friend. My heart instantly calmed down.

S and I always go together. To visit Mr. Bu Fangji, he naturally had to come along too. Nearing the gate of St. John's, the school staff had already opened the two large gates. We took out our name cards and said we wanted to visit Principal Bu.

"Is it Old Mr. Bu?" a uniformed staff member asked.

"Um!" We found it a bit funny. Perhaps that's what they called Principal Bu.

The staff member stood on the footboard, acting as a guide. We got out of the car in front of Mr. Bu's residence.

Looking at my watch, it was exactly 1:50, ten minutes before our two o'clock appointment with Mr. Bu. We wandered around the porch.

"Old Mr. Bu is taking a nap. I don't know if he's woken up yet," one of the staff members inside the house said.

This place is truly beautiful, truly serene. A vast expanse of grass, interspersed with large trees, set off the surrounding environment in a very antique and natural way. This surrounding scenery reveals a peaceful and solemn atmosphere, not vulgar or excessive at all. I fear most the gardens of wealthy families, everything is new, a bit shocking. What is seen here is entirely old. St. John's is indeed a respectable family! Human wisdom is half from talent and half from environmental cultivation. The contribution of St. John's graduates to society and the country undoubtedly largely comes from the ancient environment and excellent training.

In the distance of the grass, we saw a mule pulling a mower, doing the work of cutting grass. We had seen motorized mowers or manual labor, but this was the first time we had seen a mule doing it. In the green field, this mule added a lot of natural interest.

Then we were led into the reception room. This was a room facing the handrail, and the entire layout surprised me a bit. The simple furnishings here were full of antique charm. A long table was of the old Chinese style, appearing elegant. Next to the window was a rattan sofa, covered with light green cushions, which reflected each other with the interwoven green leaves outside the screen window. This room was a bit like a Bungalow on the mountain. This is the life of seclusion in the countryside.

On the wall, there was a wooden couplet, which read:

"Tea Fragrance Purple Bamboo Shoots Dew,

Zither Rhythm White Duckweed Breeze."

As we were admiring it with fascination, the sound of the host coming downstairs interrupted our thoughts.

Old Mr. Bu did not look like a 75-year-old. His hair was frosty white, but he looked energetic. He had a tall figure and a kind face, not much different from how he looked more than ten years ago.

After we exchanged greetings for a while, the host invited us to his office.

In this square office, we could not find a single modern piece of furniture. The desk was quite large, surrounded on three sides. On this table, I don't know how many years Old Mr. Bu has spent?

Next to the stove, there were two rattan chairs standing side by side. Opposite was a more comfortable large chair. The host kindly insisted that I sit on it, saying, "This is the guest's chair!"

On the wall were couplets written by He Shaoji:

"Rice seedlings are green, white egrets descend,

Mulberries are ripe, yellow cranes sing."

In the middle of the two couplets, there was also a horizontal plaque with the words "Joy in Zither, Books, and Interests." Hanging such fine couplets in this antique office was especially appropriate in the current season. We looked around. Aren't the rice seedlings green? Aren't the mulberries ripe?

Next to the door, there was also an authentic Chinese-style long desk, piled with many books. A table of this shape is not easy to find in Shanghai.

S and Old Mr. Bu sat side by side, and the conversation began with Shen Bao.

Old Mr. Bu is an old friend of Shen Bao. He said: "Shun Pao is the best paper in Shang-hai."

He expressed great admiration and regret for Shen Bao's suspension last year. Every year he went to Qingdao to escape the summer heat, he always notified the school to have Shen Bao sent to him daily, so for decades, he met with Shen Bao every day. He believed that Shen Bao was fair in its attitude, elegant in its writing, and constantly progressing with the times. It was China's only leading newspaper. (The following is continued by S)

### On the Upper Floor of Fulo, Guangxi Road: A Woman is Murdered; Corpse Found on Bed; Niece Discovers Upon Visiting; Police Dispatch Officers to Investigate the Truth

Yesterday morning around 8 o'clock, a bloody incident occurred in the pavilion room on the third floor of No. 51 Guangxi Road, at the Zhu Fuxing Buddhist Goods Store. The murderer fled the scene immediately after the incident. The details obtained from the investigation are recorded below.

Sudden Female Guest Rents Empty Room

Zhang Wenxiang, the second landlord of No. 51 Guangxi Road, works as a qin player at the Qunfang Association in the Great World. The storefront of the house is rented to Zhu Fuxing, who runs a sculpture idol store named Zhu Fuxing Buddhist Goods Store, entering and exiting through the front door. Zhang himself lives on the front floor of the second floor, and the rest is rented out to others, totaling five or six households. Because the second landlord himself didn't have enough space, on May 20th, he instructed to build another wooden room on the third floor's platform. While construction was underway, a female guest in her twenties, claiming to be surnamed Gao, said she and her husband wanted to rent the room. At that time, it was stated that the monthly rent was 6 yuan in national currency. On May 26th, the woman moved in furniture, including only a wooden bed and two tables and chairs, nothing else. However, the second landlord never saw a man entering or exiting, nor did she usually cook meals.

Niece Visits; Alluring Corpse Lies Across

Unexpectedly, yesterday morning around 7 o'clock, a woman arrived, speaking with a Changzhou accent. She was the woman's niece, visiting her aunt from the countryside. Pushing open the door, she saw her aunt (the woman renting the room) lying across the bed, covered in blood. Extremely frightened, she cried out. The roommates and the second landlord heard the alarm, got up, and went to see. They immediately reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives. The woman had already died. They immediately sent the deceased to the mortuary for an autopsy. At the same time, they took the deceased's niece back to the police station. According to her, the deceased was her aunt, named Gao Yangshi, 24 years old. Her uncle was named Gao Rongsheng, 28 years old, who worked as a peddler on the boats. Gao Rongsheng fled immediately after the incident. Whether she was killed by her husband or there are other reasons, it is currently impossible to find out. The police are currently investigating.

Pharmacy Boss Forces Maid; Zhou Cuiyun Demands Living Expenses

The defendant has not arrived, so the formal prosecution is underway. Zheng Jialing (67 years old), the owner of Jiahe Pharmacy in Jiyang Lane, No. 6 Henan Road, from Cixi, was recently sued by his maid, Zhou Lingyun (28 years old), from Ouxiangshan, who hired lawyer Feng Song to file a complaint with the First Special Court, requesting payment of 20,550 yuan for living expenses and medical expenses. According to the court records, on the 17th, Judge Wu Shaochang attempted to mediate in the first court. The opposing party, Zheng Jialing, allegedly is not in Shanghai at the moment, and no one received the summons on his behalf, so he did not appear in court. Because mediation failed, the court ordered a formal prosecution.

### Two Major Fires at the Pudong Gonghexing Wharf Last Night; Most of the Two Thousand Bales of Cotton Burned

According to the North China Daily News, yesterday (the 17th) before dusk, two fires broke out at the Pudong Gonghexing Wharf. About two thousand bales of cotton stored there were severely burned. At 6:05 PM, two fireboats received the report and rushed to the scene of the incident. Upon arrival, they saw that half of the four thousand bales of cotton stored in the "B" warehouse were already on fire. They did their best to extinguish the fire to prevent the flames from spreading to neighboring houses. Since 5:30 PM, when the fire was first discovered, the Chinese and foreign firefighters of the wharf's own fire brigade had been extinguishing the fire on the scene. However, because the number of water pipes was insufficient, they could not control the flames. An hour later, a firefighter went to change clothes near the "C" warehouse, 120 yards away from the burning warehouse, and discovered that several bales of cotton in the "C" warehouse were also on fire. The fire brigade rushed to put out the fire. By dawn today (the 18th), the smaller fireboats were still anchored at the scene to prevent the embers from reigniting. Soldiers of the Japanese Marines, armed with rifles and bayonets, remained stationed at the scene throughout yesterday afternoon. Several Pudong police officers also prevented coolies from approaching the fire pit. The cause of the fire is not yet certain and is currently under investigation. However, it is reported that the warehouses were all locked at exactly 5 PM, and the fire was seen thirty minutes later. Many believe that a major fire was prevented due to the immediate action of the members of the in-house fire brigade.

### False "Livestock Market" Attempts to Monopolize Fresh Livestock Industry; Includes Chicken, Goose, and Duck Industries in Addition to Cattle and Sheep; Industry Peers Discuss Response Measures

The so-called "Shanghai Livestock Market" organized by the Japanese puppets originally occupied the Yuezhou Road slaughterhouse as its slaughtering site. Fresh pig merchants, deeply aware of righteousness, refused to cooperate. The Japanese puppets, out of anger, used special forces to detain cargo ships in fresh pig production areas without permission, forcibly transporting them to the Hongkou district for slaughtering and market sales, taking the opportunity to raise pork prices, causing the fresh pig industry to be forced to suspend operations. It is now learned that the Japanese puppets, in order to conspire to monopolize the business, have decided to implement further plans, including slaughtering fresh livestock such as chickens, geese, and ducks, in addition to pigs, cattle, and sheep, providing large quantities, in order to control the market. It is rumored that they have occupied dozens of acres of land on Tongzhou Road to build a large-scale slaughterhouse, and are currently undertaking large-scale construction. If this plan is implemented, all industries will be severely affected, and it will also concern the needs of citizens' lives. Therefore, all industry peers will conduct discussions in the coming days to discuss countermeasures in order to resist illegal behavior.

### Public Bus Smoke Emission Issues; Letter Requesting Company's Attention

Public buses in the concession often emit thick smoke, which is annoying. The Public Works Department has repeatedly negotiated with the British-owned China General Omnibus Company. Recently, the Bureau reported that various public buses still have this unpleasant phenomenon from time to time. Therefore, it sent another letter requesting the company's attention. The police had obtained a report from the London Passenger Transport Board, which contained various facts regarding the issue of smoke emission from buses. The report was forwarded to the bus company by the Public Works Department so that the company could have a basis for solving the cause of smoke emission. It is learned that the company replied in a letter stating that not every bus owned by the company emits unpleasant thick smoke. In fact, this situation has been greatly reduced recently. Some older, low-speed vehicles inevitably emit smoke at times. The main reason is that passengers are crowded, resulting in excessively long driving times. In addition, some vehicles occasionally leak smoke. However, this type of situation is unavoidable by public buses in any country. As for excessive smoke, it is not caused by the long years of driving the vehicles. The company sent a letter to the Assistant Commissioner of Police on December 2nd of last year, explaining the difficulty that all the company's vehicles could not be repaired on time due to the sudden increase in passengers compared to previous years, and said that when new vehicles are added to various routes in the future, the company will be able to increase the number of repairs so that the above-mentioned situation can be improved. The London Passenger Transport Board report attached by the Bureau has been reviewed. The company is well aware of the various reasons stated in the report, and the company has made every effort to adopt various measures to reduce smoke. Part of the new vehicles ordered by the company have arrived and will be put into use soon. The number of repairs will naturally increase in the future, so that passengers will not feel inconvenienced. The Commissioner of Police will submit reports to the Bureau on this issue on time in order to continue to find ways to ban it.

### Gao Lansheng's Condition Unchanged After Being Shot

The details of the shooting that occurred on Shantou Road the night before last have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to news from last night, Gao Lansheng from Hangzhou, who was seriously injured, underwent surgery by doctors after being admitted to the hospital. Because his condition has not yet left the dangerous state, doctors ordered him to refuse visitors. The night before last passed well, and there were no changes in yesterday's situation. However, his condition has not been alleviated. Whether his life is in danger will have to wait for a considerable amount of time. Only if the injury does not change significantly can it be determined. In addition, lawyer Jin Yu and Rong Kun, who were also shot at the same time, were slightly injured and are expected to recover soon.

### Woman Sentenced for Transporting Opium

Liu Zhaonian, a Chinese detective from the Narcotics Division of the Inspectorate General, learned that opium dealers often traded opium with Chaozhou woman Ma Zhengshi at the Beizhan Hotel, No. 43 Jielu. He then pretended to be a client and ordered eight liang of opium from Li Qing, who was at large, for 100 yuan, agreeing to deliver it to Room 2 of the hotel at about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. In time, Ma arrived and was arrested by Liu, along with eight liang of opium, and taken to the Huishi Police Station, where she was transferred to the women's detention center. The day before yesterday, she was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted her for transporting opium. Judge Jiang Shuzi, after questioning her, sentenced Ma Zhengshi to two years and six months of imprisonment, and the opium was confiscated and destroyed.

### Landlord and Tenant Assault Each Other Over Rent; Both Severely Injured

Gu Fusheng, a local from No. 155 Jinxiu Lane, Binlang Road, demanded the rent from Peng Daishi, Peng Zhushi, and other tenants from Tongzhou at about 10:00 PM on the 14th of this month, resulting in a quarrel. Each led their children and daughters-in-law to engage in a major fight. As a result, landlord Gu Fusheng was struck in the left hip with an iron bar, and it is feared that his wrist bone has been broken. Peng Daishi's thigh was also stabbed with a knife, and her injury was also very serious.

Yesterday, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented the case, prosecuting both sides for assault.

### Man Commits Suicide After Being Abandoned by Mistress

Wang Rongfu from Ningbo, 37 years old, residing at No. 4, Lane 217, Gansu Road, Youfu Lane, recently developed a love affair after being abandoned by his mistress.

At 9:00 PM on the 17th, he checked into Room 45 of the Ningyu Hotel, No. 91 West, at the intersection of Edward Road and Mintini Road (opposite the Great World) in the French Concession, under the pretext of staying overnight, and committed suicide by taking poison. The next morning, tea boy Cai Zhigen discovered it and reported it to the accounting room. Wang was sent to Renji Hospital, but because he was deeply poisoned, he died an hour after being admitted to the hospital. The hospital reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate and summoned the deceased's wife, Wang Heshi, to the case.

### Former Police Officer of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Caught with Gun and Counterfeit Money; Claims He Was Asked to Carry It by a Chinese Detective Informant

Li Jingtai (34 years old) from Shandong, residing at No. 162 Yidingpan Road, previously served as a police officer in the Chinese Municipal Public Security Bureau. At about 1:00 PM on the 9th of this month, he was riding a free car with a concealed broken automatic pistol and counterfeit bills of exchange, two for five yuan each from the Bank of Communications, and one for five yuan from the Central Bank, wrapped in newspaper. Near the intersection of Connaught Road and Kesefei Road, he was stopped by Chinese police officer No. 2258 and taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. He claimed that the gun and counterfeit money were given to him by Ge Yuting from Anhui, an informant for the Chinese police officer, to take to a certain place temporarily, promising to pay him 20 yuan, etc. The police station postponed the arrest of Ge and sent him to the court for custody. The day before yesterday, they were sent together to the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, requesting an investigation of the two defendants. Each held to their own words, but Chinese police officer No. 2258 proved that Ge Yuting was indeed working as an informant elsewhere. The case of Li committing the crime of carrying a gun and counterfeit money was reported by Ge in advance. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that they still be remanded in custody pending sentencing.

Automobile Driver Crushed

Yesterday afternoon at about 5:00 PM, automobile driver Xiao Zhenfu (38 years old, from Suzhou), residing at No. 9, Lane Shundong, Ganshi East Road in the French Concession, was driving a black-licensed car to a gas station opposite the Paramount on Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai. While he was refueling the car at the rear, another black-licensed car (No. 3442) also drove to the station to refuel. When the car entered the station, due to excessive speed and unstable brakes, it knocked down the driver Xiao Zhenfu in front, breaking his spine on the spot. Xiao's internal organs were also severely injured. Afterwards, the car that caused the accident took him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. His life is in danger.

Bandit Leader Gao Shunyu Apprehended and Executed

Gao Shunyu, the leader of the bandits in the guerrilla area of western Shanghai, had dozens of followers. Under the guise of a guerrilla team, they openly kidnapped people for ransom under the pretext of extorting donations, rampaging in the area around Hongqiao Road Airport. Farmers with some wealth in the surrounding villages were repeatedly kidnapped and none were spared. As a result, the people hated them to the bone but could do nothing about it. The matter was learned by a certain unit of the regular army stationed there, which immediately issued a warning. However, Gao and his bandits were unrepentant and continued to rampage as before. At about 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Gao swaggered along with two of his accomplices to sip tea at a small teahouse in Wujia Lane. They were detected by the garrison who, without making a sound, suddenly sent a team to arrest them. Gao and his bandits were caught off guard. By the time they realized the situation was bad and wanted to escape, the surrounding area was heavily guarded and the troops were everywhere, making it impossible to escape. They surrendered. The army believed that Gao's crimes were extremely serious and could not be tolerated. After interrogating him, Gao admitted to many cases of kidnapping and was immediately identified. At 8:00 PM that night, he was tied to the execution ground and executed by shooting, and his crimes were announced as a warning.

### COMMEMORATING THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF GORKY'S DEATH

— Translated by Ou Zhi

——Translated from the Soviet "Literary Calendar"——

Three years ago, on June 18, 1936, Gorky, the greatest writer of our generation, passed away. He died on the battlefield and was poisoned by the lackeys of the fascists. Molotov said at Gorky's memorial service: "After Lenin, Gorky's death is the most painful loss for our country and for mankind."

In the early 1890s, when the flames of the proletarian revolutionary struggle were burning more and more brightly in Russia, when the great Bolshevik Party was founded, Gorky came out with his earliest works.

Gorky came from the deepest strata of the people. According to his friend Romain Rolland, he had suffered from childhood "the poverty and humiliation that make up the fate of the enslaved proletariat." He maintained a close relationship with the working class forever, "He is the true founder of socialist literature in the working class society of our country and the world proletariat." (Molotov)

Gorky said: "Writers think that literature is their private affair... This is the most harmful nonsense. Literature has never been the personal affair of Stendhal or Tolstoy, literature is always the cause of the times, the country, and the class." Gorky's creation is the cause of the working class, the cause of the Russian people. At the same time, it is also the cause of the entire progressive humanity, because Gorky is a writer of enormous world scope, belonging to the workers, peasants, and freedom-loving intellectuals of all nations and all countries. No writer's name is more famous among the world proletariat than Gorky's name, and no work is more loved by workers of all countries than Gorky's Mother.

Along with Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, Gorky gave boundless meaning to the creative possession of the literary heritage of the past. Gorky learned a lot from the great masters of Russian and world literature. He was the heir and continuer of the best traditions of Russian and world literature. He was the living link between socialist literature and Soviet literature.

He inherited its humanism from progressive classical literature, as well as its respect, attention, and love for people. But he did not stop at the stage reached in this regard by the most glorious figures of the old literature before the socialist era. He went far ahead, becoming the initiator and ardent protector of socialist new humanism. (Omitted below)

### ON THE LONGHAI RAILWAY (PART 1)

— Le Huan

From Shangqiu to Lanfeng

The countryside is filled with the breath of the night, and stars twinkle in the sky, shining with faint light.

Our party of four, accompanied by a briefcase containing important things - it is burdened by a brother. Relying on the help of starlight, we move on the winding path; wheat stalks grow on both sides, swaying in the starlight. We quickly pass through the wheat fields with intertwined wheat shadows.

The brother carrying the heavy burden is walking faster and faster, and our pace is also speeding up. Strength is concentrated in both legs, and no one has opened their mouth. In the silent space, only the monotonous carrying pole accompanies the brisk footsteps with a squeaking sound. Our destination, Shangqiu Station, is reached in this accelerated pace -

Running into the station, A-Fa suddenly becomes active. He first discovers that a row of trains facing west are lying obediently in front of the station, and he jumps up with joy, shouting loudly: "Our luck is really good!" The quiet air is broken by him!

"Wait a minute, I don't think it will be so cheap!" Lao Yu is not optimistic about this train.

We put our luggage and briefcase aside, and the brother is responsible for guarding, then run close to the train.

There are no lights in the carriages, and a large pile of dark heads flicker in the darkness; they are the cells of the country, and now they are a mass of people who are groping at the beginning of awakening. When asked when they will arrive here, their answer is: It has been two nights!

We ran into the stationmaster's office. The stationmaster is busy working on the telephone, and the pen in his hand is quickly sliding on the paper; he smiles and nods to us, meaning to greet us.

"Excuse me, stationmaster, when will the train in front be able to start?" I asked as soon as he took the microphone away from his hand.

"There is no certain time for this train, because there are too many trains heading east, and they are more needed, so the westbound trains cannot be predicted..."

"Then will there be a wounded soldier train coming down tonight?" I interrupted him and asked.

"Wounded soldier train? -" He flipped through the book he had just written on. "——Yes, probably around twelve o'clock." The words are very certain.

"Then let's wait for this train!" I looked back at the other comrades. From experience, I know that the wounded soldier train is faster and spends less time at each station. They all have no objection.

Waiting for a train is the most boring and impatient thing. We want to make time pass faster, so we chat with the stationmaster casually. He is very eloquent, like a slick, pot-bellied merchant.

But I don't think this method is effective. I desperately smoke cigarettes, one after another, and a large pile of cigarette butts and matches has accumulated. The clock on the wall still does not want to move forward so leisurely.

With great difficulty, another two hours have passed. A pleasant message comes from the phone, saying that the wounded soldier train has left the previous station. But it will take almost an hour to get here.

Four or five carriages are already full of comrades who have been wounded for justice, talking loudly about the things they think are proud of on the front line; some are vigorously waving their injured arms, forgetting the pain of the body; and from time to time they make loud laughter. Although it is midnight, they are not tired.

In order not to infringe on their rights, and even more so not to make them more crowded, we decided to carry our luggage and briefcase to the roof of the car, and people lay down on the arc-shaped roof.

The train moved slowly in the stationmaster's whistle; we drove through the cracks of the trees on both sides, lying flat on the roof of the car, admiring the silvery white sky, the flashing stars, and the hazy countryside. The fatigue of the past few days has been conquered. I thought of the night ferry in Shanghai in summer, and we forgot our situation. I almost felt that I was bumping on the night ferry again.

In the night breeze, I felt a little cold, and I covered the military blanket next to me on my chest. The brother leaning on the briefcase has already started snoring softly, and the car continues to drive straight through the cracks in the trees. (Charity sale donation)

### DANGEROUS BUILDING

### CONFUSED ARGUMENT

— Bian Luo

"Confusion" is generally regarded as a not-so-bad shortcoming in modern society, which seems to be better than "evil"; if someone borrows money to gamble it all away, it is a moment of confusion, if he robs with a knife, it is a bit of "evil". But there is also confusion that is praised, "reading without seeking thorough understanding", "not seeking thorough understanding" is a bit "confused", but after Tao Yuanming's leisurely visit, he won everyone's praise, it seems that confusion also has art. Like the ordinary so-called drunkard, they are mostly a little confused and criticized, but Li Taibai is not. Zheng Banqiao said something like "rarely confused", which can be said to be advocating confusion, and now there are still people talking about it, which shows that things in the world are originally different and ingenious.

Confusion also has true and false distinctions. The confusion of the so-called celebrity hermits is mostly not "true foolishness" but "pretending to be". Li Taibai, in addition to drinking, can also hum something like "clouds want clothes and flowers want appearance", so even today the tavern still wants to use "Taibai's legacy" as a gimmick. And Liu Adou is a practitioner of "life is proud and must be happy". Moreover, "I am happy here, not thinking about Shu" is also his honest words, but he has been laughed at and scolded to this day. In fact, no matter whether your confusion is true or false, if you try to use "purity", "seclusion" or other beautiful names to cover up your confused complacency, it will eventually be in vain. Liu Adou is a confused egg that should be laughed at and scolded, but in modern times, trying to escape by confusion can only prove your own decline.

The most in the world are self-righteous confused eggs. They are not only confused themselves, but also hope that others are as confused as them. "Seeking skin with a tiger" should be an ideal fool. But some people kowtow to the tiger and beg for mercy, or send up some pork and beef or one of their own hands and feet, hoping to give the tiger satisfaction, until they know they have been taken by the tiger, they should sincerely ask the hunter, but they are afraid of killing all the tigers in the world, making the world too quiet. There are many such confused eggs in the world. As for their own clay feet are already unstable, but they still hope to beat others to kneel, their ambition is commendable, but in reality it is confused incompetence.

Also, if you put on a peaceful mask, make a set of nonsense about losing both sides, regardless of right and wrong, and want to use surrender as complacency, such people cannot escape their guilt by confusion. There are many precedents in history, but what is the result? It is said, "Stinking for ten thousand years!"

There is such a joke: "A nosy person took pity on Qin Hui and Wang's statues kneeling in front of Yue Wang's tomb, dismantled them and threw them into the river, so as not to be humiliated all year round. But that night he had a dream, dreaming that Qin Hui and Wang came to thank him. When he woke up in the morning, he thought: Qin Hui is so efficacious, if Yue Wang is efficacious, what should I do? He hurriedly went to the river to pick them up and repeatedly asked them to kneel there, and after that, no one went to dismantle them again, and they became forever damned." The joke is unrefined, but the love and hatred are very obvious. Qin Hui also doesn't look very smart, and the nosy person is not confused to the end, and finally wakes up and understands the truth of what ordinary people call good and evil. I hope that the well-meaning people of today will not be so confused!

### Impressions of a Mountain Tour (Continued)

— Li Jinming

Five

The Taoist priest led us up the stone steps again, preparing to return to the road. Suddenly, he stopped, shouting: "Fa Liu, Fa Liu! What are you up to over there... Hurry up and bring back the firewood!"

We looked in the direction of the Taoist priest's gaze and discovered some movement in the deep weeds, with a child's voice muttering. As we were paying attention, the Taoist priest put on an indifferent air, saying, "It's nothing, it's nothing, let's just keep going."

After walking no more than twenty or thirty steps, a monk, as wild as a buffalo, scrambled out of the bushes and fled down a small path.

Following the road upwards, for no more than three li, there was a nunnery. As we passed the gloomy entrance of the nunnery, I wondered: Why would there be a nunnery here?

Turning past the stone steps, we discovered a pure white stone pavilion, which was "Halfway Pavilion." The reason it was praised was simply because some important people had inscribed it. The pavilion was indeed built well, but it was so isolated and out of the way that it was easily overlooked by visitors.

Crossing the road from Halfway Pavilion, following the Taoist priest's instructions at parting, we climbed up two sets of stone steps and arrived at a villa with an inconspicuous name. The man who came out to greet us was also dressed like a broker, but a strong sense of commercialism made me think that he hadn't worn a cassock for very long. This fake monk showed us around the house for a while and let us stay on the steps outside the window, enjoying the breeze and the mountain view. Soon, tea was brought up, and the fake monk said:

"Our boss is from Jiangxi, runs a medicinal herb store, and has quite a bit of money in hand. This house was built for him to spend the summer."

"We're not planning to rent," said Da Peng.

The architecture of the house was still good, facing the valley between the east and west mountain ranges, allowing us to see the lush greenery and the prosperity of the houses. However, the ingenious "Halfway Suspended Clouds" were lost here; at the same height, from the same viewpoint, there was such a different transformation!

Six

Leaving the Jiangxi man's villa, after a winding mile or so, we found the mountain villa where Li Jing of the Tang Dynasty lived in seclusion. The house was large and had been repaired many times, so it was not ancient. Although the pillars and beams had been freshly painted and the walls freshly whitewashed, we still couldn't feel any modern flavor. The bamboo forest was so elegant, and the mountain cliffs behind the house were so upright and beautiful. When visiting West Lake, the lonely situation of Bao Puzi's mountain hut was much different. But there was no one living in the house; on the steps, there was a handful of straw, two charred bricks, a pile of chicken feathers, and some ashes. I didn't know if some travelers had come here for a picnic, or if it was the traces left by a large number of beggars who had cooked chicken, eating it clean.

Lazily, we walked out of the mountain path and continued along the road.

In the distance, there was the sound of cuckoos, as if coming from the farmers' houses in the valley. But as the journey progressed, the soil content gradually decreased, and the barren rocky layers gradually increased. The density of the lush green gradually became sparse, and the barren cliffs that did not show vitality in spring gradually increased.

"Sir, have a good heart, give us some charity, spend some money."

"Spend a few coins, sir, with great virtue and generosity!"

Beggars wearing long gowns followed us, but they were all poor farmers from this area, strong, dark, and without any signs of illness. It was not easy for them to live on this high, barren land more than twenty li from the ground. We were willing to share some food with them because they were not without hope of survival; they were still healthy and should have a meaningful existence. Sickness, disability, and deformity should be entrusted to the god of death: but we must help human beings with the power to survive.

### Night Question

— Yan Qi

Blue sky, dreamless night,

Rain and wind in the lamp's light,

Picking up a cluster of stars and moon bright,

Shining on a goddess' face of white.

Suppose it's by the lake at midnight,

Where is tomorrow's human light?

A journey of wandering, a journey of thought,

Hanging question marks in the clouds, caught.

### Talking Extra

Yesterday was the third anniversary of Gorky's death. Because this publication is closed on Sundays, Mr. Ou Zhi's translation was published a day late. However, our commemoration of this great world writer is always lasting and new, so even though it's a day late, we still want to commemorate him.

Discussion

### On the Legislative Issues of Ethnic Minorities in Southwest China

— Ding Yuchang

Anyone who has traveled to or delved into the history and geography of the western border regions of our country knows that, in addition to the Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan ethnic groups, there are many other ethnic minorities distributed throughout the western provinces and regions. Roughly speaking, such as the Lieluo and Baiyi in Yunnan, the Ming Fan ethnic group in Xikang, the Miao and Yao in Guizhou, the Yao and Peng in Guangxi, Guangdong, and western Hunan, the Li ethnic group in Hainan Island, and the Yi ethnic group in the old Jianchang Dao eight counties (now under the jurisdiction of Xikang Province) of Sichuan... totaling no less than several million people. Guizhou Province is the most prominent, with the saying that the province's population is "four Han and six Miao." The aforementioned ethnic minorities, combined with the Hui ethnic group in Xinjiang and Gansu, the Tibetan and Fan ethnic groups in Tibet and Qinghai, the Mongolian ethnic group in Mongolia, and the Manchu ethnic group in the far northeastern provinces that have not been sinicized, should total no less than twenty to thirty million people. In our country, due to the large population of the Han ethnic group, it is still a small number in comparison. According to anthropological research, these ethnic minorities are most closely related to the Han ethnic group in terms of bloodline. And due to historical wars and commercial relations, they have close political, economic, and cultural relations with the Han ethnic group, but on the one hand, they still maintain their unique culture and language, and have not been completely sinicized. Even in terms of law, although laws have been implemented in various provinces and regions throughout the dynasties, continuing to maintain their unity, for the aforementioned ethnic minorities, they have mostly been regarded as outside of civilization, and have not been strictly implemented, even to this day.

Throughout the dynasties, the central government's relationship with the ethnic minorities in Southwest China (including the Miao, Yao, Li, Lieluo, and Baiyi) was that it maintained suzerainty, while allowing their rulers to manage their tribes, and had very little direct contact except for tributes and wars. They were also not like the Manchu and Mongolian ethnic groups, who had entered the Central Plains and ruled the Han ethnic group, and had legally placed themselves in a superior position, such as the Jin Dynasty's legal provisions for the three classes of "Zhong Ren," "Han Ren," and "Nan Ren," the Yuan Dynasty's division into the four classes of "Mongolian," "Sèmù," "Han," and "Southern," and the Qing Dynasty's division into "Banner People" and "Han People," etc., in order to oppress the Han ethnic group. Their economic lives were mostly stuck in hunting, nomadic, or early agricultural societies. From the perspective of historical materialism, their ideology was confined to the scope of tribes or feudalism, which was different from our Han ethnic group, which had entered into a commercial society. Therefore, the laws created by our Han people are naturally difficult to apply uniformly to these ethnic minorities. From the Rebellion of the Five Barbarians at the end of the Jin Dynasty to the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the Han ethnic group continuously used force to conquer them, oppressing them to penetrate deep into the mountains of southwest China. After the Tang Dynasty, the surrendered tribal leaders or meritorious generals were often granted hereditary official positions, establishing the Tusi system. The Tusi was the highest and sole ruler within his feudal tribe, while the Han official yamen was in the lowest position. This feudal Tusi had the concept of "I am the law" for his subordinates. Under his rule, the ethnic minorities had the power of life and death at his whim, and the central government or local officials never had the opportunity to advise. As a result, this ethnic group lived in dire straits, and rebellions occurred frequently. After the implementation of the "Replacing Native Officials with Appointed Officials" policy at the end of the Qing Dynasty, the feudal Tusi political system was gradually abolished, the regular local government was reorganized, and this ethnic minority was liberated, placing them among the common people. Wherever the native officials were replaced with appointed officials, most of the ethnic minorities had been sinicized, making it difficult to maintain their culture. However, even now, this feudal Tusi political system has not been completely eliminated in various border areas. Even in places where appointed officials have been nominally established, due to poor management by the authorities, they are still in name only, and the real power is still in the hands of the descendants of the old Tusi, which is not uncommon. Therefore, the status of these ethnic minorities is not equal to that of the Han ethnic group in reality. The Provisional Constitution stipulates that all citizens of the Republic of China are equal, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, or occupation, which has not been implemented in the southwestern provinces, which is by no means an exaggeration.

In the past, Guangxi was the first province in Southwest China to actively seek liberation for ethnic minorities in politics. Guangxi was also the fastest and most widespread to sinicize ethnic minorities. Decades ago, most of western Guangxi was under the rule of Tusi. Today, except for the Yaoshan Mountains between the Liujiang and Guijiang Rivers, where some Yao ethnic groups remain, there is no trace of the Tusi political system. The Yunnan Provincial Government, after the establishment of Xikang Province in the western border areas, is said to be setting up bureaus to influence the Yi ethnic group (located in the old Jianchang Dao eight counties) who have never interacted with the Han ethnic group. This shows that after the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the shift of the political center to the western plateau, the central government is actively promoting the work of liberating ethnic minorities.

We should certainly liberate the ethnic minorities who are under the oppression of feudal Tusi, so that they are in an equal position with the Han ethnic group in law and in fact, but whether we should make them eliminate their inherent written language and thoroughly sinicize them is a question that can be discussed. For the legislation of ethnic minorities in Southwest China, in principle, it should be based on Mr. Sun's legacy, and in terms of technology, we hope that the government will consider the following points:

First, the central and local legislative bodies should have representatives of various ethnic minorities to participate, so that they can contribute their opinions as much as possible on the special legislation for their ethnic groups.

Second, the validity of the written languages and languages of ethnic minorities should be confirmed in law. Ethnic names that contain insults or contempt for Chinese characters should be prohibited from use, in order to harmonize ethnic sentiments.

Third, areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities should be divided into "legal regions" different from those of the Han ethnic group. The current civil, criminal, and commercial laws should be applied in consideration of their economic life and cultural level, and taking into account their inherent good customs, and the scope of implementation should be appropriately determined. Or even formulate separate regulations, so that there is the possibility of implementation.

Fourth, the Tusi system must be abolished. Special legislation must be enacted to assist the development of ethnic minorities' production and construction, education, and culture.

We believe that legislation based on Mr. Sun's legacy will be the beginning of the liberation of ethnic minorities in Southwest China.

Research and Criticism

### Can a Signature on a Negotiable Instrument Be Replaced by a Fingerprint?

— Wang Xiaowen

According to the provisions of Articles 21 and 121 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the issuance of bills of exchange, promissory notes, and checks must be signed by the issuer, and other acts on negotiable instruments, such as endorsement, acceptance, and guarantee, also require the signature of the endorser, acceptor, guarantor, etc. as a necessary condition. This is because, according to the provisions of Article 82 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, when a negotiable instrument is not paid or accepted when it is due, the holder may exercise the right of recourse against the endorser, issuer, and other debtors on the negotiable instrument after exercising or preserving the rights on the negotiable instrument, and according to the provisions of Article 2 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, anyone who signs on a negotiable instrument must be responsible for the text on the negotiable instrument. If the debtor on the negotiable instrument does not express his intention by signing, the holder will have no basis when exercising the right of recourse.

Therefore, the signature on the negotiable instrument should be clear. Ancient Chinese characters are not acceptable. However, according to the provisions of Article 3 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the signature on a negotiable instrument can be replaced by a stamp or fingerprint, which is really incomprehensible. Although using a stamp to replace the signature on a negotiable instrument is different from the interpretation of common characters, it can still be said to be recognized by the general public. However, using a fingerprint to replace the signature means that there is no standard for the type and style of the fingerprint, which will inevitably make it impossible for the holder to know who drew it, which will greatly hinder the circulation of the negotiable instrument and the exercise of the right of recourse. In civil acts, because there are specific parties involved, even if the signature of the parties is replaced by a fingerprint, cross, or other symbol in accordance with the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Code, there is no obstacle. However, it is undesirable to recognize that the signature on a negotiable instrument can be replaced by a fingerprint.

Since the signature on a negotiable instrument can be replaced by a fingerprint, illiterate people can also use the provisions of the Civil Code to make a fingerprint, which is unacceptable. Therefore, in my opinion, the words "fingerprint" in Article 3 of the Negotiable Instruments Law should be deleted. As for the proposal of the Bankers Association to add the words "or" under the words "stamp" to the Legislative Yuan, it is also irrelevant.

Collection of Judicial Decisions

(Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court) When there are the same or similar legal reasons, it should be considered that there are the same or similar legal effects, which is a matter of course in jurisprudence (Shanghai Zi No. 42 in the 28th year of the Republic of China)

Although partners do not need the consent of other partners to transfer shares to each other, if they only transfer shares to the manager and there is no obvious intention to express withdrawal from the partnership to other partners, it cannot be considered a legal withdrawal. The transfer of shares only transfers the proportionate share of the partnership property to others, which has nothing to do with the status of the partner. If the transferor does not perform the procedure of withdrawing from the partnership and notifying, it cannot be considered that the partnership relationship between the transferors has been terminated for other partners. Even for the transferor himself, he is still a partner. The so-called intention to express withdrawal from the partnership to other partners, if only the transferee records the transfer of shares in the partnership resources book, it is difficult to have the effect of withdrawal (Shanghai Zi No. 44 in the 28th year of the Republic of China)

The court should review the facts in accordance with the meaning of the debate and the results of the investigation of evidence, and make a judgment based on free judgment. If the reasons for the judgment obtained are not contrary to the law, the parties shall not make further disputes based solely on empty words (Shanghai Zi No. 53 in the 28th year of the Republic of China)

Important Legal News

### Those Who Are Incarcerated and Drafted into Military Service Should Be Allowed to Serve Outside on Bail

There is considerable doubt as to how to handle cases where criminal detainees are drafted into the National Military Service by drawing lots, as there are no provisions in the Enforcement Regulations of the Military Service Law prohibiting or suspending service, nor is there any other basis to rely on. The Ministry of Justice previously submitted a request to the Judicial Yuan for verification. It is now known that the Judicial Yuan issued Order No. 2663 to the Ministry of Justice on December 19, 27th year of the Republic of China, stating that the Provisional Enforcement Regulations of the Military Service Law have been drafted by the Ministry of Military Affairs in April of this year and submitted to the Military Affairs Committee for instructions to be temporarily implemented. Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the draft amendment to the regulations states that active-duty and age-eligible personnel who have one of the following matters may postpone their enlistment year, which is called postponement of service, and Paragraph 5 states that those who are suspected of criminal offenses and are still in court but have not been convicted shall still receive education and conscription for the National Military Service, etc. According to this provision, criminal detainees who are drafted into the National Military Service by drawing lots shall be allowed to serve outside on bail if they are in the period of receiving education or conscription.

Legal Questions
— (Feng Meixue)

(Question) Jia married Yi in the 24th year of the Republic of China. After the marriage, they did not get along. A year later, Yi left Jia's house and has been missing ever since. (1) Can I apply to the court for mediation and divorce in accordance with Article 1052, Paragraph 5 and Paragraph 9 of the Civil Code? (2) Can the mediation procedure be bypassed? (3) Can the mediation statement or the statement of claim and the application for public delivery be sent to the court at the same time? (4) Can I publish an announcement in the newspaper for three days, limiting the time to express my intention and notify the address within one week? Can this reminder be used as evidence of application for public delivery and malicious abandonment? (5) If Yi returns home as soon as the announcement is published, and Jia is unwilling to take her in and still wants to file for divorce, is it legal? (6) What form should the application for a one-sided debate and judgment be in, a written statement or a verbal statement? (Wang Shan)

(Answer) (1) Article 1052, Paragraph 5 of the Civil Code refers to malicious abandonment. Based on the circumstances described in your letter, it cannot be immediately considered malicious abandonment. Paragraph 9 of the same article refers to those who have been missing for more than three years. Although Bing left Jia's house, she may be at her mother's house, or her mother's house knows her whereabouts, and she cannot be immediately identified as missing. (2) Divorce cases should be applied for mediation first according to law. (3) If mediation is possible, please apply for mediation first, and then file a lawsuit after mediation fails. If the location is indeed unknown, you can apply for public delivery. If Yi is at her mother's house, or her mother's house knows her whereabouts, you should not apply for public delivery. (4) It is difficult to predict whether Yi will see the newspaper that was published, and it is difficult to use this as evidence. (5) Before a legal divorce, Jia has no reason to refuse to take her in. Based on the circumstances described, divorce should not be granted at all. (6) You can apply verbally.

Brief Remarks

### The Cheapest Season for Crime

— (Useless)

Criminal law has "fixed-term imprisonment," "two months or more and fifteen years or less," and the period is calculated in months. Therefore, committing a crime and being sentenced to two or three months, in February of each year, is the cheapest season, because February is a flat month, with only twenty-eight days, and although March has thirty-one days, April has thirty days. If you encounter July, August, or the 13th month of January, they are all thirty-one days, so the difference is two or three days.

Current Affairs

### All Shanghai Cinemas Will Add "Safety First" Movie

— Yun

Han Langan and Sang Shuzhen both worked as extras to explain the humorous "pushing, staring, dangerous."

"In 1938, there were as many as 15,810 road accidents in Shanghai, resulting in 213 deaths and 4,953 injuries." This is a shocking number!

Because of the occasional negligence of both drivers and pedestrians, such shocking and unfortunate events occur, but people never pay attention to how to avoid the occurrence of such unfortunate events. The "Safety First" campaign recently promoted by the Public Security Bureau of the Concession is to pay attention to the cooperation of drivers and pedestrians to avoid the recurrence of such unfortunate events. Since its implementation, they have added patrol posts at intersections to guide and correct pedestrians and drivers' traffic rules, and use wireless broadcasts and various entertainment venues to constantly advise people on the meaning of "Safety First."

Recently, a "Safety First" movie has been produced by the cooperation of Ike Fa Coda and Xinhua Film Company. The whole film is 1,300 feet long and will take about ten minutes to show. From today, all Shanghai cinemas may add this film.

Yesterday morning, the Public Security Bureau first performed it for reporters from various newspapers in Daguangming. Therefore, I also got to see it first.

The content of this movie is the same as the "Safety Campaign" announcement posted in the two concessions, but the actual performance allows everyone to have a deep impression on how these unfortunate events occur, and at the same time, how to avoid them.

Actors from Xinhua Film Company, such as Sang Shuzhen and Han Langan, all worked as extras. The performance of these common comedians on the screen will make people more deeply remember the "Safety" impression.

The narrator is said to be Mr. Chen Dabei, using Shanghai dialect, and quite humorous. For example, it is most dangerous for children to play on the road. The picture shows a group of children kicking a ball. When chasing, a car drives from behind. The children cannot avoid it and are run over. The narrator: "This child is the only son of the three families!"

In addition, bicycles cannot be loaded with heavy objects behind them, otherwise the center of gravity will be unbalanced and the body will be crooked. This is very dangerous when a car comes from behind, so the explanation is: "Why put so many things on the bicycle?"

Other warnings, such as pedestrians not being able to cross in front of vehicles, not being able to call rickshaws across the street, etc., when the picture shows the danger that occurs as a result, it says "Danger?"

"Pushing, staring!"

Therefore, I think that using movies for publicity is certainly more effective than adding patrol posts and posting announcements. Because every driver and pedestrian thinks that nothing unfortunate will happen to their driving and walking before the accident, and after the accident, both sides have to shirk responsibility and think that the fault lies with the other party. Now this "Safety First" movie clearly tells both sides what time and what place is likely to be dangerous, and uses the camera's eye to deeply imprint it into the brain.

From this, we know that the publicity power of movies is greater than that of words. Then, I think that merchants who use this as a profit-making tool, what reasons can they use as "excuses" in the future?

### Mr. Yuan Songnian's Recent Work

### How Painting Can Be Called Vital and Lively (Continued)

— Buddha

During the Kaiyuan period, General Pei Min, while in mourning, visited Wu Daozi and requested him to paint a mural at the Tian Gong Temple in the Eastern Capital. Daozi said, "My painting brush has long been neglected. If the General has divine skill, first dance a sword dance for me." So Min took off his silk robe and galloped like the wind, whirling left and right, waving his sword into the clouds, as if lightning struck down. Min drew his hand to hold the scabbard, pierced through the stopper and the person. All those who witnessed the scene were amazed. Daozi then picked up his brush and painted on the wall, and a gust of wind arose, creating the most magnificent scene under heaven. Daozi's life was dedicated to painting, and he considered this his most successful work.

Wu Fenyang, Zhao Zong, once had Han Gan paint his portrait, and everyone praised its excellence. Later, he had Zhou Fang paint it again. Guo Zhang was present, and they couldn't determine which was superior. One day, Zhao Zong's wife, Madam Ning, came to visit. Fenyang asked, "Which one is more like me?" She said, "Both are similar, but the former captures Zhao Lang's temperament, his way of talking and laughing."

Liu Songnian had an enemy who painted a picture. When the teacher of the painting school went out, everyone was pushing to have a theatrical scene painted, with every posture fully rendered. The enemy, Bao Fu, imitated it. When he came to a boy holding a bamboo pole with spider silk, and the spider was going up and stopping, as if alive, he couldn't help but put down his brush. Indeed, a master has a skill that is unattainable by others.

The righteous Marquis Ma once loved a painting of a cow returning to its pen. One day, he displayed it outside his study. A tenant farmer standing below the steps stared at it for a long time. When he left, the Marquis saw him and called out, "I have a prized painting. Why are you laughing at it?" The tenant farmer said, "I am not a connoisseur of paintings, but I know a real cow. When a cow is returning to its pen, its tail is clamped between its thighs, and even strong men working together cannot open it even slightly. The tail of the cow in this painting is raised, so I laugh at its inaccuracy."

Emperor Huizong of Song loved painting. He once ordered students to paint peacocks ascending a stool on a screen, but none of them satisfied him. He then ordered other students to present their works one after another, but even with the greatest effort, none were accepted. So they went together to ask for instructions. The emperor said, "Whenever a peacock ascends a stool, it must lose its left foot. In all of your paintings, they lift their right foot first. Observe it, and you will see it is true." The artisans were then convinced of his precise understanding of things.

In the past, Meng Chang obtained a painting of Zhong Kui by Wu Daozi. The second finger of Zhong Kui's left hand was digging out a demon's eye. He ordered Huang Quan to change it to the thumb. Huang Quan then used his elbow to paint on silk and presented it. Chang asked him why, and Huang Quan replied, "In Wu Daozi's Zhong Kui, all the strength and spirit are in the second finger, which cannot be changed. Although my painting is not as good as Wu's, all the strength and spirit are in the thumb, which cannot be moved."

Bi Hong, a minor official of the Tang dynasty, was famous at the time. When he saw Cao Zao's painting, he was greatly surprised and impressed. He asked Zao who had taught him. Zao said, "I take nature as my teacher and find the source in my heart." Bi Hong then laid down his brush.

Mr. Jian Chu Tang Zai wrote in his "Mirror of Painting" that the "Night Rain over Xiaoxiang" painting is the most difficult to conceive. Song Fuguo's "Eight Views" are quite difficult to depict. The sound of bells cannot be painted, and in "Night Rain over Xiaoxiang," it is already night, and it is raining again, so what can be seen? It is said that Fuguo first painted and then conceived the idea, only roughly showing the misty and fading scenery. Later mediocre artisans, learning to paint this theme, illuminated the cables with torches and reflected the ships with lonely lamps. Their vulgarity and shallowness are obvious.

### Clear Sky After Rain

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Twelve: Scarlet Beauties Avenge, Difficult to Erase Misdeeds; Green Windows Discuss Love, Renewing a Good Relationship

Pan Peiying received a piece of happy news that came out of the blue today. The person whom she thought she would never see again had been resurrected. This was truly the so-called "reviving the dead and restoring flesh to bone," a joy that exceeded all expectations. Hearing Yuan Shuwen's words, it was clear that Zhao Ertian was not dead, and this was absolutely certain. But Pan Peiying was anxious to ask where Letian was at this moment. Just as she was about to ask, Yuan Shuwen continued, "Mr. Zhao is also in Wuxi. Did you not know? I heard that his grandfather used to run a rice mill, it seems that the place is in Xueyan Bridge. Now Mr. Zhao has inherited his father's business and has a National People's Food Commission. Each province has established a People's Food Protection Committee. Wuxi has always been a place where grain and rice are concentrated. Before the war, it was a place where rice markets gathered, and it has become even more prosperous after the war. I heard that Mr. Zhao has been sent by the Jiangsu Provincial People's Food General Festival Committee to be in charge of rice regulation matters in Wuxi. I only know a rough outline, it was something they mentioned occasionally, but the detailed situation is unknown." Pan Peiying thought: "Sure enough, he is in Xueyan Bridge, then it will be easy to find out. Indeed, the government has recently made a lot of efforts regarding the people's food problem. This problem, in China, has been a major problem for thousands of years. When we were young, we also read a passage from Mencius saying: 'If there is a famine in Henan, then move its people to Hedong, and move its grain to Henan. If there is a famine in Hedong, do the same.' It can be seen that in ancient times, people often migrated to find food, probably because of the inconvenience of transportation. Because transportation was not available, one place was often crowded, and another place lacked. Those who held to local narrow-mindedness would even be suspicious of people from their own country. During the war, it goes without saying that there were also unscrupulous merchants who caused trouble. After the war, the people's food is the first thing, and in view of the famine after the Soviet Union's Great Revolution thirty years ago, we must pay attention to it carefully. This regulation mechanism is to prevent the place where rice is produced from being crowded, and the place where rice is not produced from lacking. And it is also necessary to make transportation appropriate, so that the price of rice in all parties can be balanced. Wuxi was originally a rice-producing area, but the rice it produces each year is only enough for local needs. Because Wuxi is now more prosperous, and it is a factory area, more rice is needed. But Wuxi has always been a place where rice markets are located, a place where grain is concentrated, and all the rice mills and so on are here, so the Jiangsu Provincial Regulation Committee wants to send special personnel to be stationed here."

### "Artificial Cotton"

— Xian Ren

Worn for a few days, it stretches five or six inches; Washed a few times, the material becomes fuzzy.

With the change of the seasons, the clothes that protect the body must also be changed! Fur robes and camel's hair should be put away in boxes, and even lined clothes are no longer suitable. Therefore, these days, single long gowns and single cheongsams are perfect. As long as you pay a little attention to the people coming and going on the road, who isn't wearing a beautiful so-called "Paris" long gown? However, unfortunately, a bad phenomenon is happening at this time.

Originally, people wanted to make some economic calculations. They couldn't afford "real Paris" at more than a dollar per foot (except for a few bourgeois), but they wanted to be fashionable, so they had to look for substitutes. A type of "fake Paris" made of "artificial cotton" became popular for a while. Whether it was men's long gowns or women's cheongsams, it was quite popular in the market. Probably because things made of this "artificial cotton" are quite cheap, only three or four cents a foot, which is naturally much more cost-effective than "real Paris" at more than a dollar a foot. But, please observe carefully, is this "artificial cotton" a domestic product? Is it a domestic product? Humph! Then you've been fooled!

According to a friend who is familiar with this matter, the "artificial cotton" that is being sold as fake "Paris" in the market is not a domestic product. You must not be fooled. They use its low price to win the favor of the general public! It's embarrassing to say, but in fact, many friends have been fooled!

"There is another drawback," that friend told me: "This kind of 'artificial cotton' is fine when you first wear it, but after three or four days, it will stretch out elastically, at least five or six inches longer than the original. At that time, it is not only unsightly, but also inconvenient to walk."

"If you wash it once or twice, the material will become fuzzy, and it won't last long if you wash it more often," he continued. "People are neglecting future troubles for the sake of immediate cheapness."

Friends! What are your thoughts after hearing the above words? If you still have a conscience, you should be aware of it!

### Situation in the Jiangnan Examination Hall

The literary atmosphere in Jiangnan has always been strong, and there are even more candidates this year. Even after adding examination booths, more than six thousand people were still turned away. Those who entered the examination hall in both Upper and Lower Jiang numbered over ten thousand. The first examination hall was sealed early, and the second examination hall was slightly renovated, which led to overcrowding and chaos, almost causing trouble. More than ten scholars died in the examination hall, including a few who died from illness, but many were claimed by vengeful spirits. Countless others were delirious and unable to finish the examination. Here are a few examples to serve as a warning. Heaven's law is immutable; how can we not fear it?

One wrote a four-line, five-character poem on the examination alley: "One, two, three, four, five; the drum sounds on Mingyuan Tower; sister sleeps on the bed; the lover suffers in the examination hall." He went mad and died. One night, a candidate suddenly muttered to himself, as if arguing with many people. The neighbor secretly listened but could not hear clearly, knowing something strange was happening. Later, he heard a loud cry, "I'm leaving!" The next day, he was found dead, his whole body black and blue. One slapped his own cheeks repeatedly, then used a small paper-cutting knife to cut out his own heart, bleeding to death.

One finished his paper and recited it aloud, very pleased with himself, certain that he would pass. Carrying the paper to submit it, he passed by the furnace and suddenly threw the paper in. Others snatched it away, but half of it was already burned. He seemed to wake up from a dream and said, "Walking to this place, someone told me, 'This is the place to submit papers,' so I threw it in." When asked what grievance he had, he remained silent and left.

### Population of London

The King of Persia visited London and asked a British official for the actual population. The British official replied, "According to the population map from two years ago, plus the natural increase of 140,000 in the past two years, the population is 4,025,609. If the streets in the city were connected end to end, the total length would be 19,800 li." The King of Persia was speechless with amazement! The total population of Persia is only six million.
