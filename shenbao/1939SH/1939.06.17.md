### Japanese Army in Tianjin Intensifies Blockade of Concessions, Incitement Activities Become More Intense, Food Shortages in Concessions, British Consul Lodges Verbal Protest, Japanese Side Refuses to Respond, Japanese Veterans' Cemetery Visit Plan Automatically Cancelled

(Hong Kong) External News: The Japanese army in Tianjin has been blockading the British and French concessions for the third day today. No incidents have occurred. Japanese sentries continue to check people entering and leaving the two concessions. For foreign nationals, they only check their passports and the contents of their bags. However, British nationals must undergo the same treatment as Chinese, being checked in order, with some forced to undress and others forced to return after the search. It takes Chinese people seven or eight hours or more to enter the concessions, with some waiting for twenty-four hours. Many Chinese workers have been prevented by the Japanese from entering the concessions and ordered to work in the area under the jurisdiction of the puppet temporary government. Food is still relatively abundant in the French concession, but more difficult in the British concession. Two Chinese vendors attempted to deliver several baskets of vegetables into the British concession, but were shot and killed by Japanese soldiers (Dispatch on the 16th).

(Tianjin) The main events that occurred here today are as follows: (1) Two Chinese people were reportedly arrested and shot for passing baskets over obstacles into the British concession. (2) The activities of agitators have become more intense. (3) Food shortages continue. This morning, several gunshots suddenly occurred near the obstacles at the entrance of Racecourse Road, awakening residents in the southern section of Special District One from their dreams. It was then learned that two Chinese people had been shot for passing baskets over obstacles into the concession, causing widespread panic. The Japanese side claimed that this action was to teach others a lesson. It is reported that yesterday, more than two thousand rioters who failed to break into the British concession were now gathering at several laundry shops in Special District One that serve foreigners, severely scolding the owners and staff for washing foreigners' dirty clothes and advising the laundry workers not to work for foreigners, destroying the baskets used for holding clothes and throwing the clothes around before leaving with a swagger. Today, residents in the British concession are slightly fearful upon hearing that the Japanese are repeatedly trying to enter the concession under the pretext of visiting the graves of Japanese who died in the Boxer Rebellion. The British authorities are currently considering this matter. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

(Tokyo) The plan of Japanese veterans and other Japanese to enter the British concession in Tianjin in a procession to visit the graves of Japanese who died in the Boxer Rebellion has been automatically cancelled upon the advice of the Japanese authorities there (Reuters dispatch on the 16th).

(Tianjin) This morning, the Japanese authorities intensified the blockade of the concessions, making it even more difficult for Chinese people to enter and leave, so very few were granted passage. British nationals, mindful of the insults they suffered in the past two days, do not lightly leave the concessions unless absolutely necessary. A Chinese foreman told a Reuters reporter that this morning he saw a large number of coolies on the French concession side of the Wan Guo Bridge, wanting to enter the British concession, being forced into cargo trucks in groups of thirty and driven elsewhere. He asked a foreigner crossing the bridge what was happening. The foreigner replied that the Japanese were recruiting these coolies to work elsewhere. The food situation has not improved much. Although there were more vegetables in the vegetable market this morning, the prices were high and the quality was poor. Milk was also transported into the concession by truck, but it was still insufficient. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

(Tianjin) According to Japanese sources, the Japanese consulate has refused to acknowledge the British consul's protest against the Japanese soldiers' overly strict search of British nationals and the difficulty in transporting food into the concessions. The British consul's protest was a verbal protest over the phone, but the Japanese side replied, "Japan has its own discretion in maintaining peace and order in Tianjin, and others are not allowed to interfere." However, although today's searches are the same as yesterday's, the stripping of clothes has stopped. Many people here believe that if the United States were to protest, the blockade of the Tianjin concessions would be lifted sooner. Fox Company's photographer, Meier, was released tonight, which relieved the British consul. When American McCain passed the Japanese sentry line on Wilson Street today, he repeatedly stated that he was an American, but he was still searched. McCain then reported to the American consulate, and after the American consulate negotiated with the Japanese side, the Japanese side immediately apologized, considering it a misunderstanding. After that, McCain was no longer searched when entering and leaving the area. Due to the unstable situation in Tianjin, British merchant ships have now changed their berthing to Qinhuangdao. (Associated Press dispatch on the 16th) According to Japanese newspapers' report of the Tianjin situation, the Japanese side must have the following conditions before the British concession can be unblocked: (1) The British and Japanese will jointly search for the perpetrators of previous and subsequent terrorist acts. (2) Thoroughly crack down on anti-Japanese elements in the British concession. (3) All attempts to disrupt the economic measures of the "temporary government" in North China must be eliminated. (4) The silver currently held by Chinese banks in the British concession, worth 50 million yuan, must be handed over to the "temporary government." The Japanese authorities in Tianjin are determined to continue isolating the British concession until the British side accepts and implements these conditions. The Japanese authorities are also preparing to adopt more effective plans to counter new provocative actions by the British side. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The Hebei Provincial Bank recently decided to move out of the French concession on the 18th. The French concession authorities specifically notified the Banking Association, saying that the bank has not been approved by the concession authorities and must not move out on its own. Moreover, the bank has been operating in the French concession for a long time. If it moves out suddenly, it may affect the financial situation within the concession and is not easy to move out. (Dispatch on the 16th) Today, the Japanese army continued to blockade the British and French concessions. Although the situation is tense, it is peaceful and uneventful. Most of the British nationals who went outside the British concession yesterday moved into the concession, reducing the chance of accidents occurring at the obstacles set up by the Japanese army. This morning, the vegetable market was empty. Chilled meat can still be purchased, but vegetables are almost impossible to buy. This morning, the British embassy expressed surprise that the Japanese had not yet released Canadian photographer Meyer, who was arrested two days ago. Although the Japanese promised to release him late yesterday, he was still detained as of 9:30 this morning. (Associated Press dispatch on the 16th)

(Tianjin) Canadian news photographer Mr. Meyer, who was arrested on Wednesday for taking pictures in what the Japanese called a restricted area, was released today. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

(Hong Kong) According to Japanese claims, the British ship Yang Tai Sheng (transliteration) rushed into the blockade area of ​​Gulangyu yesterday, transporting many Chinese passengers and goods. The Japanese authorities have issued a warning, prohibiting any further attempts of this kind from occurring. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)

### London Official Issues Semi-Official Statement, Japanese Claims Involve Treaty Rights of Various Countries in China, If Formal Demands Are Made, a Serious Situation Will Be Created, At That Time, Britain Will Have No Choice But to Consider Taking Positive Action

(London) Responsible persons here say that the Japanese army's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, is extremely serious in nature, and they have issued a semi-official statement explaining Britain's position, stating that the case originated from the Japanese side pointing out that four Chinese people were involved in the Cheng Xigeng case and demanding their extradition, but consistently refusing to present evidence. (The British concession authorities subsequently agreed to refer this issue to an independent advisory committee, but the Japanese side did not agree and decided to implement a blockade of the British and French concessions. A Japanese spokesman then issued a statement involving serious issues in the Far East. It was found that a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement on the 24th of last month, the intention of which threatened the treaty rights held by various countries in China. The British and French governments have made representations on this matter, and the case is still unresolved. However, this decision by the Japanese spokesman in Tianjin has intensified, which shows that the extradition of the four Chinese people is no longer the reason for the blockade of the British concession. What the Japanese side is demanding is "Britain should cooperate with Japan to build a new order in East Asia." In other words, Britain should abandon its policy of assisting General Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang, and not allow any protection for anti-Japanese elements and communists, stop assisting the Chinese legal tender, and stop hoarding various goods from the north." (Havas dispatch on the 16th)

Map of the British and French Concessions in Tianjin

No longer condoning illegal elements in the concessions using money to transmit news, prohibiting schools in the concessions from using anti-Japanese textbooks, all of these broad demands are sufficient to involve the treaty rights held by various countries in China, and the British side will certainly consider them to be serious in nature. The meaning is almost that Britain should abandon its original policy under the threat of violence. The British government had originally proposed to the Japanese government that the Tianjin dispute be made a local incident. Although the Japanese authorities have rejected this proposal, Britain still hopes that it will change its attitude. On the contrary, if the Japanese authorities in North China unfortunately persist in their views and formally make new demands, a serious situation will inevitably be created. At that time, the British government will have to consider taking immediate positive action to protect its interests in China.

### US Will Jointly Protest with Britain and France

(Washington) American businessmen there are similarly affected by the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession, so the United States is expected to join with Britain and France to lodge a strong protest with Japan. This decision was made after a special meeting between Secretary of State Hull and his principal advisors. However, regarding the adoption of economic retaliatory measures against Japan, such as refusing Japanese ships and commercial projects, a cautious attitude will be taken, fearing that strict economic sanctions would be enough to cause war. According to officials, no matter what action Secretary of State Hull takes, it will not put the United States on the front line. (Associated Press dispatch on the 16th)

### Japanese Action is a Show of Support for the Axis Powers

(Paris) According to French officials and diplomatic circles, the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin is a show of support for the Rome-Berlin Axis, as it would prevent Britain and France from focusing on Europe and shift their attention to Asia, so dictators can have a respite. However, Britain, France, and the United States are still consulting incessantly, but nothing is known except that the governments of the three countries are paying close attention to the situation in the Far East. At the same time, the content of the consultations is also unknown. Regarding Britain and France's decision to adopt strong retaliatory measures against Japan, it is still not considered credible here, because the British and French governments' discussions have concluded that economic retaliatory measures may not be effective, because Japan's current position is quite capable of waging economic warfare against Britain and France, and at the same time, it can extend this blockade to other concessions, such as Shanghai. According to those familiar with current affairs, the most worrying thing at the moment is that the Japanese will force the British to take a hard line. It is reported that the French government has decided to stand on the British side regarding the Tianjin incident. Although Japan has specifically chosen Britain as its target for provocation, France will not change its consistent attitude with Britain. (Associated Press dispatch on the 16th)

Editorial

### Suggestions for Traffic Safety Awareness Week

In the past year, there have been as many as 15,183 traffic accident cases in the two Shanghai concessions, with 5,166 deaths and injuries. The concession authorities are worried about human lives and are cautiously seeking ways to prevent accidents. Therefore, they have decided to hold a Traffic Safety Awareness Week starting tomorrow, which is a very good intention. The reason why the number of accident cases has reached an unprecedented record is attributed to pedestrian congestion, which is not without reason. Not only is it congested, but also because refugees from the mainland flock to Shanghai, they are unfamiliar with traffic regulations and do not know how to avoid traffic. When they suddenly see vehicles speeding by, they are often panicked, at a loss, and unable to move forward or backward, resulting in unexpected events. Furthermore, some drivers disregard pedestrian congestion, take it lightly, and assume that people will give way to them, but they do not know that cars can injure people. As for those who neglect their duties and treat human lives like grass; those who are careless and make people know that the road is like a tiger's mouth, which should not be taken lightly, while also strictly adhering to traffic regulations and not treating human lives as a game, making the movement a reality, which is truly a blessing for the citizens.

However, traffic safety awareness is a superficial measure. The reason why there are so many accident cases is that if population congestion is the main reason, it is largely contrary to the principles of urban development. The prosperity of a city lies in the development of industry and commerce, which inevitably attracts refugees from all over the country to Shanghai. Therefore, cities are not worried about population congestion or pedestrian disturbance, but about how to maintain order and ensure the safety of traffic, which should be planned from all aspects of municipal administration.

The prosperity of the Shanghai concessions is generally closely related to China's internal turmoil and external troubles. From the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Small Swords Society to the Boxer Rebellion, the Xinhai Revolution, the Qi-Lu War, and the arrival of the National Revolutionary Army in Shanghai, Shanghai will prosper every time there is an incident. Only the "January 28th" and "August 13th" incidents caused Shanghai to appear desolate during the war. After the August 13th war shifted inland, Shanghai returned to its status as a "safe haven" for refugees. When the two concessions were initially planned for road administration, they were much wider than the roads in mainland China. They did not consider the factors that would contribute to the prosperity of the concessions in the next hundred years or so, or the progress of material civilization as it is today. Later, they also tried to adapt to the needs of the environment, gradually improving over time and location, but ultimately limited by the old equipment, unable to make large-scale improvements. As a result, the population increased slightly, and the original roads were insufficient to cope with the new situation of congested vehicles and pedestrians. This is why the number of accident cases increases with the increase in population.

Before the war in Shanghai, the factory areas were all in the north and south of the concessions, and due to the terrain, there were many roads directly connecting the north and south of the concessions, and fewer roads connecting the east and west. The only main roads in the public concession that can be called east-west connecting roads are Xinzha Road, Avenue Edward VII, Beijing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, and Fuxu Road, which is currently being widened, as well as Weihaiwei Road and Racecourse Road turning into Fuzhou Road. In the French concession, there is only Avenue Joffre and Xujiahui Road. In addition, Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch are now jointly managed by the two concessions. The position of Avenue Dubail, which connects Avenue de Kesseler and Avenue Foch, is similar to that of the future Weihaiwei Road. And when it enters the Xihui area, only Yuyuan Road, Daxi Road, and Connaught Road are left. After the Shanghai War, all factories sought development in Xihui, so the traffic from east to west became more prosperous. Since Nanjing Road is not allowed to carry goods back and forth, Xinzha Road, Avenue Edward VII, Beijing Road, and Avenue Edward VII became the main arteries for vehicles to travel east and west. Most vehicles are concentrated on a few roads, how can they not be crowded and congested, making it difficult to move and cross, and accidents are prone to occur.

The biggest harm to traffic congestion is vehicles loading goods. Small ones are like handcarts, and large ones are trucks and flatbed carts. Although handcarts and small carts are small in size, the goods they carry often extend beyond the body of the cart. They are pushed and pulled by one or two people, and the speed is not high, which is more likely to cause congestion. They also travel alongside rickshaws on the side of the road. When cars and trams pass by, the three vehicles meet, which is most likely to cause danger. This is the first reason. Flatbed carts are heavy and clumsy, and it is already difficult to pull them. They are often located in the middle of the road, obstructing the movement of other vehicles. In addition, the wooden and iron wheels cause deeper friction on the road surface, and the movement is very slow. Recently, the Public Works Bureau has charged particularly high donations for such flatbed carts, and lower donations for flatbed carts that have been converted into steam-powered carts, which also implies the intention of prohibiting them. This is the second reason. Since the prevalence of trucks, in order to load more goods and save costs, the body of the car has become larger and larger. Where the road surface is narrower, one car cannot accommodate other cars. With the current uneven width of the road, it is already narrow and unbearable to drive cars, trams, and rickshaws. In addition to the huge trucks, speeding and reckless driving, how can traffic not be congested and how can accidents be eradicated. This is the third reason.

Therefore, in order for traffic safety awareness to be effective, it should start with the rectification of road administration and vehicles. Otherwise, no matter how careful pedestrians are, the arrival of accidents is truly beyond what can be predicted. For example, walking on the sidewalk should be the safest, but there are also cases where cars drive onto the sidewalk due to poor driving, drunkenness, insomnia, or narrow roads, causing accidents. How can this be said to be "the deceased was not careful." Another example is directing traffic without waiting for vehicles to pass completely, and then releasing vehicles from other roads, making it impossible to stop and dangerous to proceed. How can this be said to be the fault of "not obeying traffic directions." Other examples include bicycles often swooping past pedestrians and vehicles from behind like eagles, suddenly catching them off guard; cars overtaking trams, and when tram passengers are getting on and off, they fly by the trams with a whirring sound, making it impossible for passengers to get on or off. The northeast corner of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road is narrow and has a lot of traffic, and pedestrians often stand by the side of the road, trying to cross, and a little carelessness can lead to disaster. This is the fault of the pedestrians. There are many similar examples. As for the psychological mistakes of pedestrians and drivers, such as one thinking that cars must give way to people, and the other thinking that people must give way to cars, if both sides have such intentions, do not know how to yield to each other, there will eventually be an accident.

There is still something that cannot be left unsaid, which is to protect the safety of pedestrians while striving to take into account the convenience of traffic for the majority of citizens. If it is necessary to restrict the driving of certain vehicles due to narrow roads or road repairs, it should start with the driving or timing of trucks, and should not restrict rickshaws, which are used by the public to travel far away. Even if it is necessary to restrict rickshaws in addition to trucks, to the greatest extent, they should be allowed one-way traffic, and should not be completely restricted, so as to give citizens the impression that only those who sit in cars can go anywhere. It is also hoped that those who direct traffic can always adopt a well-intentioned guiding attitude, be cautious in handling matters, and not abuse their powers, so that citizens will feel satisfied while maintaining traffic.

At the beginning of this Traffic Safety Awareness Week, alarmed by the large number of traffic accidents last year, we sincerely hope that the traffic safety awareness will achieve great results. However, what is stated in this article only shows the complexity of cause and effect, which requires improvement in many aspects. As for the present, cooperation is required between pedestrians, vehicles, and those responsible for directing traffic.

### Tokyo Endorses Blockade Policy

(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun said today that the Tokyo government fully supports the attitude, policy and plan of the Japanese authorities in Tianjin to blockade the British concessions. The Japanese government will not give up its policy of ensuring that Japan's goals are achieved. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

(Tokyo) Japanese Minister of the Army Itagaki and Minister of Foreign Affairs Arita yesterday reported on the situation of the blockade of foreign concessions in Tianjin at a so-called inner cabinet meeting. It is reported that the cabinet decided that the Tianjin concessions will continue to be blockaded until the concession authorities formally recognize the changes after Japan occupied North China. Regarding the British implementation of economic sanctions against Japan, political figures here pointed out that if such a plan is realized, it would violate existing commercial treaties, and Japan would immediately take countermeasures. Japanese public opinion supports the government's tough attitude towards Britain and France, and all newspapers advocate continuing the blockade until the entire concession issue is resolved in principle and finally. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)

(Tokyo) According to semi-official Japanese sources, today's cabinet meeting decided to maintain the actions of the Japanese authorities in Tianjin. Foreign Minister Arita reported to the cabinet that after the British side made representations regarding the Tianjin blockade incident, he replied that the matter should be resolved locally. He also advised the British government to take a cautious attitude and cooperate with the Japanese side to fundamentally resolve the issue. The British side expressed regret for the Japanese actions in Tianjin and requested an explanation of the proclamation issued by the Japanese military commander to blockade the concessions. He told them that he had not received a formal report from the Tianjin authorities, but felt that the matter should be handled locally. The semi-official side learned that the cabinet had also formulated a fixed policy for the government to proceed with this matter. It is reported that the cabinet made the above decision after hearing the report of Minister of the Army Itagaki. It is rumored that Itagaki claimed that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin have adopted various appropriate plans with careful methods and firm determination. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

### Japan Seeks to Force Britain to Submit

(Beiping) The words of semi-official newspapers and senior Japanese officials have clearly indicated that even if the British side completely concedes and hands over the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the Tianjin issue cannot be resolved. The Japanese side here openly claims that the current movement is to force Britain to submit and cooperate with Japan to establish a new order in East Asia. A certain Japanese agency here is now very active in anti-British propaganda and has issued various slogans, such as "Chinese must completely withdraw from the British concession," "Do not trade with British shops and banks," "Recover the concessions," "To defeat the Nationalist government, we must first defeat Britain, Britain is exploiting our fat." Such leaflets are distributed throughout North China, especially in Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)

(Tokyo) According to news received here, the director of the Information Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Kawai, gave a speech in Changchun yesterday regarding the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, stating that the future "central government" of China will eventually recover the concessions, so the first step at present should be to completely reorganize the concession organization. (Haitong dispatch on the 16th)

### Britain, the United States and France are Exchanging Views

(Washington) Yesterday, the authorities of Britain and the United States exchanged information regarding Tianjin and Gulangyu. The attitude of the US Congress has been inclined to implement economic sanctions against Japan. British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, personally visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday, which is deeply worthy of attention. According to Hull's announcement afterwards, Lindsay came to the State Department only for a "social" visit. Both sides also talked about the situation in the Far East, and said that the US authorities had exchanged information about the facts with the British side. From this, it can be seen that the US government may cooperate with the British and French authorities stationed in China, but officials at the State Department are not willing to reveal its scope and limits. Hull then said that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the US Far East Fleet, had plans to go to Tianjin from Qinhuangdao, but he was unable to verify it at present, and the State Department also showed that he did not order Yarnell to go there. He said that US representatives in China had been ordered to cooperate with diplomatic officials from other countries in Tianjin and Gulangyu to handle various issues locally, and to automatically file protests when necessary. Also, since the concessions of Tianjin and Gulangyu have been blockaded by the Japanese army, there is no definite report on how it affects American citizens. Diplomatic observers here firmly believe that the Anglo-American consultation on the concession issue is the beginning of democratic countries jointly dealing with Japan. This trend can be seen from the proposition of implementing economic retaliation against Japan, and in fact, Japan is continuing to infringe on American interests in China. These diplomatic observers all hope that the US Congress can decide on steps to resist Japan. US Secretary of State Hull has already admitted to consulting with Britain on the Far East issue, which shows that the State Department attaches great importance to Japan's attempt to control the concessions. Also, Senator Wheeler (Democratic representative from Washington), an important member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is now demanding direct action against Japan. He told the Associated Press, "Taking a lenient attitude towards Japan is of no help to the facts," and said that if only diplomatic protests are made, it is by no means a permanent solution, and it is time to take direct action. Therefore, the only way to solve the problem is to ban the sale of arms to Japan. Finally, he declared that the current situation is sufficient to make the United States change its existing policy. (Associated Press dispatch on the 16th)

(Washington) The US government today expressed concern about Japan's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull said here today while hosting journalists that the United States, Britain, France and Japan are exchanging views on the Tianjin incident in the capital, but he has not heard of any joint action by Britain, the United States and France. As for what he said yesterday that the US representative stationed in Tianjin would do what he could to ease the situation, he only meant that there was a possibility of intervention. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)

### British Study Retaliation Methods

(London) Regarding the situation in Tianjin, China, sources close to the government here have stated that the British Cabinet will wait two or three days to observe whether the Japanese government will change its current attitude. If it remains stubborn at that time, Britain will economically retaliate against Japan, with the first step being the abolition of the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty. This treaty stipulates most-favored-nation clauses. After its abolition, import taxes on Japanese goods can be increased and the quantity of imported Japanese goods can be restricted in an appropriate manner. The government has this intention. Today, Sir Inskip, Minister for the Dominions, has informed the High Commissioners of the various Dominions in London. The Ministry of Commerce is drafting a report on economic retaliation methods, which will be submitted to the Cabinet or the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee for discussion at the end of this week, and a decision will be made after considering the latest news from Tokyo. In addition, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has submitted a report to the government on his conversations with the Japanese Foreign Minister, Hachiro Arita, stating that Foreign Minister Arita only noted the British views. Therefore, the current situation has not changed. In short, the Japanese government ministers are still deliberating. The concern is that the country may, within a few days, put forward specific demands in accordance with the statement made by the Japanese spokesperson in Tianjin, namely: (1) Britain should agree not to interfere with Japan's intrusion into China in administrative and economic matters; (2) Britain should cease assisting Chinese currency. If the Tianjin dispute is limited to the extradition of the four Chinese, a friendly solution would have been possible. If Japan puts forward significant demands in the future, resistance is essential, regardless of the cost. This is because, after making concessions in Tianjin, the issue of revising the entire concession system within China will arise, and the impact will inevitably lead to the loss of Britain's rights and interests and influence in China. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

(London) The House announced today that Labour MP Adams will question Prime Minister Chamberlain on June 19 as to whether the government, in view of the importance of the principles involved, will maintain the inviolable status of the British Concession in Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

### British Consulate Lodges Strong Protest with Japan

(Tianjin) The blockade of the British and French concessions here has now entered its third day. What action will the British government take? This is the question on everyone's lips. Although the British expatriates in Tianjin are striving to remain calm and resolute, they are deeply concerned about the attitude of London. They eagerly hope that Reuters will transmit news that will help protect their rights and interests, because the lives and well-being of the majority depend on London's actions. The foreigners in the concession were initially shocked by the blockade, but are now gradually becoming accustomed to it. However, the food problem is causing anxiety. The amount of food entering the concession in the past two days has been minimal. The stalls in the vegetable market have nothing to sell, and the shops' stocks are gradually being sold out despite sharp price increases. The British Consul, Mr. Jamieson, has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese Consul-General regarding the following three matters: (1) British citizens are subjected to searches when entering and leaving the British and French concessions; (2) On Wednesday, the Japanese side did not allow some British citizens, including two British soldiers in uniform, to leave the concession; (3) Armed Japanese soldiers and Chinese police intercepted and searched the tugboats of the British merchant Butterfield & Swire Company. In his protest, the British Consul-General requested the Japanese side to immediately take measures to prevent such incidents from recurring in the future, and requested an immediate reply for transmission to his home government. Regarding the search of merchant ships, the protest stated that no one other than customs officials performing their duties has the right to board British ships. If the ship is a larger vessel or is towing barges at the time, sudden interception during navigation could lead to serious incidents endangering lives. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

### British Newspapers Advocate Firm Response

(London) London newspapers are all publishing news of the Tianjin incident on their front pages. This morning's editorial in The Times stated that the British government has always responded to repeated Anglo-Japanese incidents with patience, believing that Japan would not cause further disputes with other countries when it encounters difficulties in its war against China, for its own benefit. However, regarding the issue of the policies of various countries in the Tianjin incident, Britain and other countries must not tolerate it again. The Yorkshire Post also stated that the Tianjin incident is not a local issue, and the disputes caused by aggressive countries in some parts of the world cannot be resolved by concessions. The only way to deal with it is to treat such actions as a disease and treat them accordingly. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

(London) London newspapers today continue to have unusually激昂 editorials regarding the Tianjin incident, all advocating that the government adopt the most stringent sanctions against Japan. The "Daily Telegraph" declared that Britain cannot simply issue protests. Since Japanese provocations continue unabated, Britain must respond with severe retaliatory measures. The "Daily Express" called on the British public to boycott Japanese goods. The "Daily Mail" and "News Chronicle" both demanded that the government take firm steps. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)

(London) Regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, sources close to the Foreign Office here stated that the British government had originally suggested that a committee of three, including a neutral country representative, be formed to handle the case of Japan's request for the extradition of the four Chinese involved in the Cheng Xigeng case. Although Japan misunderstood its nature and rejected it, Britain has not withdrawn this suggestion. Therefore, as of now, if Japan is willing to accept it, it can still be done. In addition, although the British government is exchanging views with the governments of the United States and France, it has not yet suggested to those countries that they jointly adopt economic retaliatory measures to deal with Japan when necessary. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(London) Regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, well-informed sources here stated that the British government now holds the view that if the Japanese authorities believe this matter is merely a local incident, there may still be hope for compromise between Britain and Japan to preserve each other's prestige. Conversely, if the Japanese authorities regard this matter as a preliminary step towards revising the concession system within China, Britain will take severe measures to limit the import of Japanese goods into all parts of the British Empire as a retaliatory measure. Generally speaking, negotiations between Britain and Japan will take another five or six days. If no compromise is possible by then, the British authorities will take economic retaliatory measures. At this time, the British and French authorities are exchanging views to determine a common attitude.

### British and French Naval and Military Representatives to Confer in Singapore, Asian Events Endanger World Peace, Allied Nations Strengthen Contact with Britain

(London) During the debate on the expansion of armaments in the House of Lords this afternoon, Lord Davies, a Liberal Party member, spoke first, saying that it was inappropriate for Britain and France to continue supplying the Axis powers with scrap iron and other metals. For the present, the two countries should conclude an agreement with the British Dominions to restrict the export of various raw materials that could assist Germany and Italy in expanding their armaments. Lord Strabolgi, a Labour Party member, also spoke, expressing dissatisfaction with the matter, and said, "Today's events in Asia are sufficient to endanger world peace, far more than events in Europe. The British government has now taken various measures to deal with the difficulties with its French friends, which are late, but not too late. "Our General Staff should strengthen contact with the General Staffs of various allied countries. Seeing the events that have occurred in Asia, we know that cooperation with various possible allied countries is even more necessary." Recently, the Cabinet Gazette reported that the French naval and military delegations will be traveling to Singapore, and the British military delegation will also be traveling to French Indochina, which is gratifying. Admiral Chatfield, Minister for Coordination of Defence, then delivered a speech, concluding the debate, stating that the staff talks between Britain and various allied countries are important. I know that "this matter is currently in progress and will continue to be held." Especially since the military talks between Britain and various allied countries are after the military talks between Germany and Italy, its progress is naturally less than that of the German-Italian talks. "We are expanding our armaments in peacetime so that we can be prepared for any eventuality in the event of war. This standard of armaments will soon be reached." (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### Deutsche Bank Placed Under Hitler's Control, President Fully Responsible to Board of Directors, Foreign Share Capital All Repurchased at Price

(Berlin) The government gazette recently published the German Central Bank Organization Law. According to the legislative procedure, it must be submitted to the General Assembly of Shareholders for approval on the 30th of this month before it is finalized. There are three noteworthy points in the grammar: (1) The Central Bank is completely placed under national sovereignty. The redemption method is stipulated for the shares currently held by foreigners (total share capital of 150 million marks, of which 35 million marks are held by foreigners). (2) The future policies of the Central Bank are based on the principle of authority. (3) The amount of paper money issued is no longer standardized by the preparation of gold or foreign currency, but is guaranteed by national production. As for the determination of currency prices, the power belongs to the Minister of Economy and President of the Central Bank, Funk. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

(Berlin) The German government gazette recently promulgated a new financial decree, which states, "Deutsche Bank will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Führer Hitler from now on. The Führer's orders will be followed only in matters concerning German currency." Minister of Economy Funk also issued a detailed gazette to the press, clarifying the essentials of the Deutsche Bank's change of administrative structure, stating that, one, in addition to directly ruling the bank and its monetary policy, the highest amount of credit loans and treasury bills granted to the government by the German National Bank will also be decided by Hitler. The new decree authorizes Hitler to appoint the bank's directors, based on the principles of the National Socialist Party, with individual responsibility replacing collective responsibility. Therefore, the president of the bank is fully responsible to the board of directors. At the same time, the new decree stipulates the organization of two advisory councils for the president to consult at any time, composed of the heads of private banks, leaders of the business community, and celebrities in the financial community selected by the president. The share capital of the Deutsche National Bank was originally invested by private individuals. In the future, the shareholders of the bank must be German nationals of Aryan descent or legal entities residing in Germany. The bank's shares shall no longer be used for speculative purposes and the annual dividend is fixed at five percent. However, in order to compensate for the shareholders' losses, the bank's board of directors will announce compensation regulations on June 30, stipulating that the dividend this year can be increased to eight percent as in the previous year. The market price of the stock is fixed at 180, which is an increase of 1.5 percent compared to the market price of the bank's stock on the Berlin Stock Exchange last year. German shareholders holding 500 marks of old shares can not only exchange them for new shares of equal value, but also obtain treasury bills worth 400 marks. The bills will accrue interest from April 1, 1940. Foreign shareholders holding 100 marks of old shares can only exchange them for shares worth 200 marks from the discount bank. According to the Deutsche Bank's stock dividend, which was originally fixed at 12%, 8% will be paid in cash and 4% will be paid in bonds. In the future, the 4% bond dividend will be converted by the discount bank, and the cash dividend will remain the same. The 4% dividend converted by the discount bank will be directly guaranteed by the Deutsche Bank. In addition, the discount bank will pay a dividend of three marks per 200 marks of stock according to the new decree. After the bank issues new shares, the accumulated bond dividends will be exchanged for tax vouchers, which cannot be transferred. Foreign shareholders, regardless of whether they reside in Germany, may also exchange bonds for tax vouchers, except for those without nationality. People in the two protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia are entitled to the same treatment as German shareholders. Foreign shareholders are generally not allowed to transfer discounts in Germany, but may submit a transfer request if they wish to move out of the country. In other words, foreign shareholders will not have the right to transfer discounts for as long as they reside in Germany. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)

The King and Queen Depart Canada, Words of Fond Farewell, Watched by 150,000 People

Halifax The King and Queen arrived here at 3:00 p.m. today. The King was in his Admiral of the Fleet uniform and looked somewhat tired. Canadian Governor-General Tweedsmuir accompanied them. The King and Queen traveled by royal car throughout Canada, covering 8,000 miles. Today, they left the royal train and will board the "Empress of Britain" tonight to return home. After arriving here, the King broadcast a farewell address to the Canadian people in both English and French, expressing his gratitude for the welcome and hospitality he received and wishing Canada unlimited development in the future. He also said that the people of the Americas are all engaged in peaceful pursuits and have no worries about war, setting an example for the people of civilized countries on how to live and work in peace. The Queen also delivered a broadcast speech, expressing her gratitude to the people of Canada and the United States. Later, they boarded the ship and set sail amidst the cheers of 150,000 people. The King presented the Governor-General of Canada, Tweedsmuir, with the Grand Cross of the Victorian Order. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)

Halifax Harbor Sources close to the King and Queen said that the King and Queen's tour of the Dominion of Canada and their visit to the United States lasted 29 days and covered a distance of 15,000 kilometers. Everything went smoothly along the way, which is deeply gratifying to those who prepared for this event. It is said that the King and Queen have greatly won the hearts of the people both in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Canadian people say that the British government has achieved all the goals of the King's visit. In other words, relations between Britain and Canada have now been strengthened. A part of the Canadian people, who had originally intended to gradually separate from the British Empire, have also changed their attitude and support the Empire. In the future, if a second world war breaks out, Canada will be able to provide Britain with greater assistance. As for the United States, the King's visit has created a good impression on the people of that country, and even isolationists have no objections. It goes without saying that relations between Britain and the United States will become closer from now on. In short, the King's trip to the New World has made the people of English-speaking countries deeply understand that they have a bond in terms of interests and traditions. Although this relationship has not formed any special political bond, it can have a significant impact on the international situation in the shortest possible time. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

### The United States Plans to Train a Large Number of Young Air Force Personnel Within Two Years; The Necessary Funds Have Been Approved by the Senate; The Navy Department Recommends Strict Crackdown on Espionage

(Washington) The Senate yesterday passed a bill approving the government to allocate $5,675,000 over two years for the training of 15,000 young aviators. The bill has been submitted to the White House for the President's signature. (American United Press, 16th)

(Washington) The Senate Naval Affairs Committee, with the support of Secretary of the Navy Swanson, yesterday passed a new anti-espionage bill. The bill stipulates that anyone who engages in espionage or sabotage in the United States during peacetime shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no less than five and no more than twenty years. The Naval Affairs Committee issued a statement saying, "Foreign governments, including potential enemies of our country, are dispatching a large number of spies to the United States to collect military secrets and, when possible, interfere with our national defense." The statement also stated, "The actions of foreign spies are extremely obvious not only in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Panama Canal area, and along the Pacific coast, but also along the Atlantic coast and the Gulf Coast. If our country must fully protect its national defense, we must not only increase federal officials to crack down on espionage activities but also increase government power to severely punish spies during peacetime." At the same time, Attorney General Murphy declared that FBI Director Hoover has been appointed as the person in charge of counter-espionage activities. He also declared that the anti-espionage precautions implemented on the West Coast last month have been extended to the Atlantic due to the international situation. (Associated Press, 16th)

U.S. Amends

Neutrality Act

Isolationists Obstruct

(Washington) Regarding the amendment of the current Neutrality Act, twenty-one isolationist senators, including Republican Nye, Democrat Clark, and Borah, issued a declaration today stating, "Implementing the provision of cash-and-carry for arms exports is like burying one's head in the sand. Our country would be more honest to form an alliance with Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, or any other country that has a strong navy capable of controlling the oceans than to sell arms to them during wartime." In essence, we cannot condone the new Neutrality Act allowing the government to automatically lift the arms embargo during wartime and allowing belligerent nations to purchase arms from the United States. There is no room for compromise. The declaration is still seeking signatures from other senators. Republican Senator Johnson also suggested adding three points to the declaration: (1) The President shall not be granted any powers beyond those permitted by the Constitution; (2) In the event of war in the future, no one shall designate an aggressor; (3) If an arms embargo is to be implemented, it should be mandatory and impartial, applying equally to all belligerents. (Havas, 15th)

### British Colonial Secretary Explains Palestine Policy to the League of Nations; Laments the Immense Task of Fulfilling the Balfour Declaration; Does Not Take Sides With Either the Arab or Jewish People

(Geneva) British Colonial Secretary MacDonald explained British policy in Palestine to the Mandates Commission yesterday, saying that Britain did not regard its work in Palestine as difficult but as a great undertaking of sympathy expressed by the drafters of the Balfour Declaration. Britain has spent millions of pounds implementing the mandate and lost many civil servants and soldiers in defense. Britain has suffered these hardships and losses in fulfilling its international responsibilities to the Jews and Arabs, which is as it should be. However, those who support the purpose of the mandate but do not bear responsibility should understand the difficulties encountered by Britain in carrying out this particularly arduous task. The constitutional provisions most suitable for preserving the important interests of both the Arab and Jewish peoples have not yet been outlined. Although the administrative system is still undecided, it is necessary for both peoples to live freely according to their customs and beliefs. Only through this freedom can peace, friendship, and prosperity be restored and placed on a permanent foundation. The British government believes that its policy can achieve this goal in the near future, as the past animosity between the two sides is too deep and difficult to erase in a short time. However, the British government believes that its policy will inevitably lead people to turn around and face a great goal together. The British government's declaration of Palestine policy is the final action after deep consideration of the difficult problem. The British government has repeatedly tried to solve the problem without success. The Balfour Declaration is a promise made to the Jewish people and a guarantee made to the non-Jewish people. It is difficult to achieve a just solution without paying attention to these two obligations. Those who are involved in the Palestine debate either favor the Jews or favor the Arabs, which is enough to make the mandate unfair and lead to destruction. The British government and people have no partiality towards the demands of the Arabs and Jews. Britain treats the Arab and Jewish peoples equally. Past events are there, clearly documented. Britain's highest wish is to be fair to both sides and to help them live in peace and harmony. MacDonald continued that the term "National Home" used in the Balfour Declaration has a vague meaning. Great politicians such as Wilson and Smuts also recognized this possibility. The British government also believes so. This is why the term "Jewish state" was not used in the Declaration or the Mandate. (Reuters, 16th)

Britain Will Continue

The Japanese army used fierce artillery fire to encircle the Chinese army from three sides, repeatedly bombing with aircraft, and releasing large amounts of poison gas, attempting to invade Maojin, Pinglu, and Ruicheng and the areas north thereof, cutting off the Longhai transportation line. In recent days, the Chinese army has been determined to fight to the death and finally defeated the Japanese army separately. The strongholds of Maojin, Pinglu, and Ruicheng on the north bank of the Yellow River are now all held by the Chinese army. The Japanese 10th Division and a part of the 37th Division have suffered heavy casualties, totaling 10,000 men.

A battle occurred with the Chinese army. The Japanese army tried four times to break into the Chinese position but was repelled each time. After fierce fighting until noon, the Chinese army, due to heavy casualties, moved to the line of the Ma'an Bridge (all east of Jiwang) to continue fighting. (15th dispatch)

The Japanese army used eight aircraft to assist in the battle. Because the Chinese army occupied the superior mountainous terrain, they are still in a stalemate. On the 9th, the Chinese army fought fiercely with the Japanese army in Sanchakou and Chen Dian. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Chinese army also made heroic sacrifices. (15th dispatch)

Construction of Chongqing Section of Southwest Highway; Traffic Obstructed

(Chongqing) According to foreigners coming from Guiyang, traffic on the highway between Guiyang and Chongqing has practically stopped for the past few days because the river has risen sharply and bridges have been washed away by the water.

Although there are primitive pontoon bridges and other things for crossing the water, only four cars can cross the water in an hour. However, the road workers are working very hard, working more than 14 hours a day. The government highway department is also able to work effectively, so it is expected that traffic will be fully open soon. Furthermore, according to transportation circles, although foreigners say that the Yunnan-Vietnam highway will be affected and impassable during the rainy season, transportation circles believe that there will be no problems in June and July, because there are still thousands of road workers along the entire road working day and night to strengthen the roadbed to avoid being threatened by water. Therefore, the entire line will be maintained. As for the new railway line from Guiyang and Guilin directly to Annam, it can be completed in October of this year. (Associated Press, 15th)

### Japanese Army in Zhenjiang Forcibly Drafts Young Men to Replenish Puppet Troops; Japanese Army Stationed in Zhenjiang is Made Up of Remnant Troops; Shipping and Commerce Are All Seized by the Japanese

Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Japanese army stationed in Zhenjiang is constantly being transferred to various places to reinforce the suppression of guerrillas along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, so at present, the majority in the city are puppet "pacification troops" and puppet "police." The Japanese army is small. Feeling that their troop strength is insufficient, the Japanese army is actively and forcibly drafting young men in various districts, dividing them into two types: 18 to 25 years old and 26 to 45 years old. Those aged 18 to 25 are provided for training to replenish puppet troops, and those aged 26 to 45 are assigned to take on the role of "road guards" along the Nanjing-Shanghai Road. As a result, residents are constantly frightened and restless, and are moving and fleeing abroad. At the same time, after hearing this news, guerrillas such as the New Fourth Army are working harder to find ways to sabotage and obstruct the drafting. Therefore, the Japanese army's "drafting" work in various rural areas is not proceeding smoothly.

The Japanese army occupying the towns and cities is now an organizational merger of remnants of several different numbered units, named the "Zhenjiang Garrison." Discipline is extremely poor. In the Ximen area, because military police patrol the streets, there are fewer extreme actions. However, in the Zhongshan Bridge, Xin Nanmen, Dongmen, Beimen, and Nanmen Xiaohuoche Station areas, which are remote and have no military police patrolling, there are frequent incidents of robbery of pedestrians' property or obstruction and humiliation of women. Men and women in the city and countryside all regard these areas as dangerous places to avoid. In addition, in the villages outside Xin Nanmen, farmers planted many trees. Recently, members of the puppet organization claimed that guerrillas could easily hide in the forests, so the Japanese puppets went to the countryside and cut down all the trees, loaded them back into the city, and some of them were used as fuel for the Japanese army, while others were privately sold by the puppet officials, and the villagers suffered heavy losses.

Below the Jiangyin blockade line, routes such as "Jiangling" and "Zhenyang" are now being operated by Japanese merchants dispatching ships. Small ports from Zhenjiang to Taiping'an, Zhongzhou, and Liuyi are also operated exclusively by the Japanese Qing Shipping Company. Foreign ships and Chinese ships are not allowed to interfere. As for land transportation, in addition to the Nanjing-Shanghai railway, the Zhencheng and Zhenyang highways have recently been repaired and opened to traffic by the Japanese army, which forcibly orders people to buy tickets and ride the buses. However, there are many guerrillas ambushed on both sides of the highway, and dangerous situations often arise. Residents do not dare to try it. Even the Nanjing-Shanghai railway trains are often delayed due to the constant sabotage of the tracks by guerrillas.

Since the summer of last year, more than 60 Japanese-owned foreign firms and sales offices, such as "Kowloon," "Inside and Outside," "Shimizu," "Marusan," and "Maeda 12," have been opened in the city of Zhenjiang. The streets and walls and telephone poles are covered with advertisements for Japanese goods, medicines, cotton fabrics, daily necessities, etc. Every Chinese store must sell one kind of Japanese goods. Now Japanese merchants are viewing Zhenjiang as a distribution center for goods. Nanjing-Shanghai trains and Japanese merchant ships in the river unload tax-evaded goods, piled up on the roads along the river, which cannot be counted every day. Chinese goods and Western goods are almost completely absent from the market due to various obstructions by Japanese puppet donations and taxes along the way. Therefore, at present, in various places in Zhenjiang, except for local products such as food, all kinds of commercial markets have been seized by the Japanese.

Japanese Army in Daishan Levies Taxes and Opens Gambling Dens; Local Hooligans Participate in Puppet Organizations

Dinghai Correspondence: The actions of the Japanese army in Daishan are reported as follows: 1. A salt tax collection headquarters was established in Dongshajiao, and Takeuchi I was appointed as the commander to forcibly collect salt taxes. 2. Commander You He Yinzou of the 1st Mine Sweeping Command extorted 20 young men and women from the puppet maintenance association on the 11th. 3. The Japanese army recently levied gambling taxes and set up gambling dens in Gaoting, hosted by Gao Asheng. 4. On the evening of the 10th, five residents of Dongshajiao planned to hire a boat to escape from Daishan and were discovered by the Japanese army and brutally killed.

Kunshan Puppet Government Forbids Rice from Leaving the Territory

Kunshan Correspondence: Kunshan is a rice-producing area. The annual output is considerable. At present, after years of war, farmers are fleeing together, and all the farmland in the county is almost completely deserted. The new grain harvested last autumn had an abundant output. However, the Japanese army ordered the puppet magistrate to announce that all rice and grain in the county were not allowed to be transported out of the territory. Therefore, all the rice stockpiled by the rice merchants could not be sold. Since there was no flexibility in circulation, there was naturally no profit to be made. Many people were affected by this and closed their doors and went out of business. At the same time, farmers also suffered considerable losses due to low rice prices. The reason why rice prices in Shanghai are soaring so much is that rice-producing areas are being monopolized by the Japanese army, so they cannot be transported to Shanghai for sale.

Japanese Army in Yangzhou Forcibly Drafts Young Men; Forbids Young Men from the North from Leaving the City

Yangzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army in Yangzhou has recently implemented the forced drafting of young men. All those aged between 10 and 45 are included in the draft. The puppet public offices in the city are required to notify the puppet square heads to circle five people per Bao. After repeated requests from the puppet square heads, the number of draftees in each Bao in the urban area was reduced by two, while the number of draftees in the rural areas remained the same. Since the implementation of this law, young people in the city have left one after another. The Japanese army has tightened inspections at the city gates and prohibited young men from leaving the city.

### Pinghu North Temple Tang Dynasty Scripture Copied, Already Seized by Japanese Troops

Pinghu Correspondence: Pinghu North Temple, built in the Tang Dynasty, is a famous Chinese Zen Buddhist monastery. It contains two ancient pagodas, which housed all of the Tang Dynasty copied scriptures. Shanghai Buddhist believers contributed funds to rebuild the ancient pagodas in order to preserve them. During the recent fall of Pingyi, all of the famous families’ antiques, calligraphy, and paintings in the city were looted. The loss of cultural relics is incalculable. These Tang Dynasty copied scriptures, passed down to the present day, were also targeted by the puppet Education Bureau Chief Wang Lansheng, who suggested to the Japanese troops that the ancient pagodas be dismantled. All of the Tang Dynasty copied scriptures were also tied up and transported away, which is truly hateful.

Hengjing and Lili, Guerrilla Forces Active, Dozens of Puppet Soldiers Killed

Suzhou Correspondence: In the Hengjing Miaogang area of Suzhou, on the evening of the 10th, a mobile team engaged in a fierce battle with the puppet pacification team's Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Squadrons. Dozens of puppet troops were killed. In the Lili area of Wujiang, three regular Chinese army steamboats arrived on the same day, towing more than forty civilian boats, equipped with light and heavy machine guns, small cannons, and other weapons. They encountered Japanese troops and engaged in a fierce battle. The sound of gunfire and cannons was very intense, lasting for three hours before it stopped. The Japanese troops were exhausted and greatly threatened.

Japanese Troops Advance Towards Funing, Japanese Troops Repelled at Dalugang

Taixian Correspondence: The Japanese troops in Funing are increasingly alarmed as the Chinese army advances to the Yellow River embankment area. Now, with reinforcements cut off, they are even more desperate. They only maintain communication between the west gate and Yangsaidian Lake in the Lian District. The other three gates (east, south, and north) are tightly closed, and civilians are prohibited from traveling to prevent Chinese army attacks.

At Dalugang in Funing County, on the morning of the 7th, three Japanese small motorboats were discovered, carrying over a hundred Japanese soldiers. They immediately attempted to land by force. The Chinese army dispatched a team to intercept them. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated back to the motorboats to flee elsewhere.

### Soaring Prices in Suzhou, People's Lives Difficult

Suzhou Correspondence: Since the soaring gold prices and sharp decline in foreign exchange rates in Shanghai, all industries in Suzhou have been greatly affected, especially Japanese businesses. For example, rayon, which used to be sourced from Shanghai, has risen to 400 yuan. No. 120 Golden Star rayon is now selling for 380 yuan, No. 15 retail is 370 yuan, and No. 120 Tianqiao rayon is 390 yuan. The price of cigarettes, such as Mei Li brand, has increased by 50 yuan per carton, and Hua Li by 40 yuan per carton, but there is very little stock available on the market. Lao Gu soap is already out of stock, relying solely on the new Gu soap from the Daimaru Yoko Japanese trading company in Changmen to meet the market demand. For example, Da Bai Yang soap is 9.40 yuan per carton, Xiao Bai Yang soap is 9.60 yuan, Huang Yang soap is 8 yuan per carton, and Xin Gu soap is 8.30 yuan per carton. The prices of all other daily necessities have also increased. The lives of ordinary people are filled with suffering.

### Overview of Physical Education in China (1): School Physical Education Compiling Teaching Materials

(Chongqing Correspondence) Although physical education in China has been promoted in schools and society for decades, the last ten years have been an important period in the development process. The main points of its past experience and the future promotion direction are briefly outlined as follows:

Physical Education Administration: In the beginning, there was no so-called administration of physical education in our country. It was not until August 21st that the Ministry of Education convened the first National Physical Education Conference, and the "National Physical Education Implementation Plan" was passed. After being revised and promulgated, the significance of physical education was gradually valued by the general public. The Ministry of Education then organized a Physical Education Committee in October of the same year as the highest design institution for physical education. Subsequently, in November of the same year, it set up a supervisor in charge of physical education to be responsible for execution and supervision. The following year, it ordered all provinces and cities in the country to organize physical education committees and add supervisors and physical education sections in charge of physical education in order to improve the national administrative organization and facilitate promotion. Unfortunately, a part of provinces and cities could not faithfully comply due to the difficulty of obtaining specialized personnel, resulting in a lack of universal and consistent development. Those who have established committees and supervisors have shown different images.

School Physical Education: Although schools took the lead in physical education, in practice, physical education in each school varied from person to person, making it difficult to produce a consistent effect. It was not until November 20th, when the Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education organized a curriculum discussion committee for physical education in schools at all levels and promulgated the curriculum standards for physical education in schools at all levels, that there were some regulations in principle. Time and methods gradually became unified. In 23rd year, it further improved to seek uniformity in teaching materials, hiring experts to start editing the detailed teaching outlines for physical education for elementary, junior and senior high school boys and girls, which were published successively in 25th year to meet the needs of schools. However, the goal of school physical education cannot be satisfied by two or three hours of coursework per week. It is necessary to find ways to develop students' exercise habits from daily life. The Ministry of Education promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Compulsory Extracurricular Exercise in Primary and Secondary Schools" in 26th year, and the effect has been remarkable since its implementation. Social Physical Education In order to develop public physical education, the Ministry of Education has instructed provinces, cities, and counties to establish physical education grounds to provide the public with opportunities for exercise, promote sports competitions, and in April of 20th year, promulgated the "Outline of Measures for Amateur Sports Games of the Public," stipulating that each county should hold at least one event each year to promote it. For a time, the sports atmosphere in various places was greatly opened. However, in recent years, due to the invasion of foreign enemies, this kind of activity seems to have sharply reduced and should be maintained. The physical education of the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors needs to be actively promoted and encouraged.

Sports Competitions: Ten years ago, except for a few schools (mostly church schools), very few sports competitions were held that were national in scope. In the 19th year, the Zhejiang Provincial Government held an exposition in West Lake and at the same time launched the National Games, which was a complete success. The government deeply felt the significance of promoting it, so the Ministry of Education ordered and promulgated the "Measures for Holding the National Games," stipulating that they should be held in the capital and other provinces and cities in rotation every year. The fifth and sixth sessions held in the capital and Shanghai in 22nd and 24th years respectively were held in accordance with this method.

### Finance Tightening of Credit Foreign Exchange Appears with Spot Arbitrage Forward, Swap Points Therefore Repeatedly Widened

Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. In the unofficial market for British and American currencies, due to the Japanese military blockade of the British and French concessions and Gulangyu, the conflict between Britain and Japan is intensifying. The British pound exchange rate softened, and the British-American exchange rate frequently retraced, resulting in a situation where the British pound was flat and the US dollar was tight at the market's opening. However, after recent foreign exchange fluctuations, general merchants are willing to pay higher interest rates to purchase and hoard commodities, leading to a gradual tightening of credit in the city. Chinese and foreign banks with foreign exchange spot positions are actively selling spot and buying forward, thereby swapping into legal currency, causing the forward market to suddenly tighten, with the tightness increasing the further out the term. Swap points are also widening. The situation is particularly severe for spot this month. External foreign exchange firms will take advantage of opportunities to sell spot and buy July futures, offering Chinese merchants an arbitrage of US$0.3125, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of about 1.65%. In the afternoon, they again sold spot for this month and bought July futures, offering Chinese yarn and cotton merchants an arbitrage of US$0.1875, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of about 1.45%. However, in the spot market, although foreign firms had many settlements, external firms were quite willing to supply, so there was no significant impact. Most transactions were swap deals. As for the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, due to the continued strong selling interest from foreign firms, the market situation continued to ease.

Exchange Rates Tightening the Further Out the Term

Early in the morning, London cable prices for near and far terms both decreased by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained stable. London raw gold continued to rise by nearly half a pence. The exchange rate between British and American currencies was down by a small fraction of a cent. The rates against Shanghai and France were flat. The US dollar depreciated against the British pound by 0.1875, against Shanghai by 0.06, and against France by 0.0125. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The opening spot selling prices for banks were 6 pence plus for British pound and 12.625 yuan for US dollar, slightly higher than the previous close, with the British pound flat and the US dollar tight by 0.03125, due to the continued depreciation of the British pound against the US dollar. After the opening, a Chinese bank, Guohua, sold July British pound futures to a foreign bank, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, at 6 pence plus 0.375.

Yesterday's cash gold market in the unofficial market showed an increasingly narrow range of fluctuations, with a difference of only eight yuan. However, the market trend was quite firm, as a certain gold firm (on behalf of speculators) and currency exchange businesses (on behalf of wealthy individuals) still had strong bullish sentiment. In addition, securities firms had ceased selling, and even showed some absorption. However, midway through, due to the competition between silver rights firms and cash firms to sell, the price once retreated to 2,582 yuan. Ultimately, due to bullish support, it rebounded to close at 2,590 yuan, resulting in a gain of five yuan. Trading was still active, with around a thousand taels traded.

### Grains Active Wheat Sales Flour Market Reverses Dullness

Flour Yesterday, the flour market,客銷, since the Tianjin concession has been sealed off, the major help of the North China region has suffered a major blow, and it is feared that it will be difficult to restore to its original state for a while. However, the Nanyang help's sales were quite lively, because the factories can supply as much as possible, and the market is not as tight as the previous two days. About 30,000 to 40,000 bags were traded in the overall market. No. 2 flour continued to open for 4.8 yuan for exchange, and the market temporarily reported a flat station. It is said that the transaction of foreign flour is flat, and the selling price is also fresh and significant. Today, 7,000 bags of flour are exported to Tanggu, and 500 bags are transported to Qingdao.

Wheat Yesterday, new wheat sources continued to transport truck wheat from the Nanjing area, but the number was small, and the suppliers all said that the production price was rising frequently, the cost was high, and 大牛 was on the stock to wait for the price to be sold. Yesterday, I heard that the Shantou gangs suddenly had a search office, and the mills and households in this street also had fingers, and the market was prosperous again. The price opened 6.6 to 4 yuan, and a total of ten vehicles were transacted. At present, the Shanghai factory has sufficient wheat storage, and another ship of foreign wheat is about to arrive, so the market is popular, and it is difficult to be good. The market will open, roughly after the Dragon Boat Festival, there is hope for a warm

The price of rice is still rising

Du Geng Yesterday, the sources of various gangs, the cargo under the river, was still blocked by a certain party in Minhang, and there was no end in sight. The常錫 of wheeled buns was still difficult to transport. Only the蘇同崑帮 was nearly 3,000 bags, and it had been dry for more than a week, and a sweet rain suddenly fell, and the people were happy and safe, so the situation of early market openings was somewhat soft. Unexpectedly, the market is difficult to predict. Until noon, there was suddenly a large southern office guest pointed, and at the same time, the guests in this street took the opportunity to follow and accept various goods happily, resulting in a chaotic situation for a while, and a sudden tightness. The囤户 followed the wind and shadows, and also passed on to each other, shouting loudly, so as a result, the overall market situation, the fatigue was showing beauty. If the常粳 goods opened 19.8 yuan, and the重固 opened 19.3 yuan. The quotations of each goods have been increased by 23 yuan.

### The Transformation of Exchange Rate Equalization (Continued from 1st/1st)

— Sheng Mujie

(2) The Exchange Market After the Establishment of the Equalization Fund

After the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund, the situation in the black market changed dramatically, and the sluggishness of the exchange market was swept away. For example, on March 8, it was very clear that there were more foreign exchange sellers, and on the 9th, there were more suppliers. The Tianjin help, which had always been known for its absorption, also had sales. The black market price rose from 8.125 and 15.84375 to 8.40625 and 16.4375 on the 10th. Afterwards, it fell back, but on the 17th, the market sent out the first activity of the Shen Ping準 Fund, and the market price immediately stopped at the 8.25 mark. HSBC also stated that it was willing to supply and sell foreign exchange at any time at this price. Subsequently, Tianjin claimed to have purchases, and commercial needs continued, especially the import of cotton was very large. Until the end of March, the exchange market situation was one of prosperous transactions and stable schedules. However, as usual, the supply meets the needs, and there is no twist. However, further observation shows that the merchants' desire for foreign exchange needs is like a bottomless pit, and the export bills are as rare as phoenix feathers. As a result, the market needs more than supplies, which is worth noting.

In April, the foreign exchange black market was long-term stable at the 8.25 pence water準, but there were slight changes in the futures aspect. For example, in the first half of the month, the near-term and far-term prices in the exchange market were almost flat. The difference between April and July was only 1/32 of a penny, and the swap difference for one month was only 1/128 of a penny. However, in the last week of the month, the swap difference for one month was 1/64 of a penny for the British exchange rate and 1/32 of a penny for the US exchange rate. It is impossible to know how much foreign exchange the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund supplied in April, but in the last week of the month, the settlement price of foreign cotton reached as much as £200,000 to £300,000. Although the exchange market is stable, the pressure on the exchange market is very high.

Turning to May, the China and Commercial Bank organized by the Japanese puppet organization was established. Japanese banks and the Tianjin gang secretly absorbed the spot and futures British and American exchange rates. They participated in the market's sales almost every day. HSBC and other banks were willing to supply small settlements for foreign firms, but were unwilling to supply huge settlements. Those who took advantage of the rally turned to attack the futures, but were also unable to achieve their wishes. This situation was seen in late April, and was even worse in early May. As a result, the trend of futures became tight and soft. When the difference between spot and futures was the largest, the arbitrage, excluding commissions, was about 8.6% per month. Later, due to the smooth transfer of supply sources, futures gradually approached the spot. It can be seen that the pressure on foreign exchange is increasing day by day, and it is really necessary to cope with it at 82.5 pence for a long time.

(3) Observing the Bottom of the 8.25 Equalization Price

The listed price of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market was 8 pence by HSBC since June 27, which was actually higher in the market. This year, the exchange rate before the establishment of the Equalization Fund was maintained at 8.125. After the establishment of the Equalization Fund, it was pegged at 8.25. However, it is not dare to speculate whether the 8.25 equalization price, which was discovered in the market on March 17, is really the exchange rate at the water準 that the Equalization Fund Committee believes is suitable for China's economic situation. However, the biggest reason why the Equalization Fund will maintain the supply of the market at 8.25 is probably to adapt to the environment at that time and the trend of the exchange market at that time, and did not consider the pressure on the exchange market. Assuming that the Equalization Association considered the pressure on the exchange market, it must have maintained the exchange market at 8 pence and above for the entire year, because it has been exactly one year since June 27th to the present.

The pressure on the exchange market, from the previous two chapters of observation on the exchange market, can be roughly said to be the needs of trade and the Japanese puppet's purchase. The trade needs are also indirectly making Japan gain foreign exchange. The analysis is as follows:

Regarding the Japanese puppet's purchase, the methods adopted by Japan are various. First, the Jianghai Customs is now almost controlled by the Japanese army, and the customs revenue is entirely stored in the Japanese 行, so it is intended to exchange legal currency for foreign exchange. Second, in the broad Central China region, Japanese banknotes and military tickets are strongly exchanged for legal currency to Shanghai to purchase foreign exchange. Third, the banknotes issued by the pseudo-organized bank are used to transfer legal currency and purchase foreign exchange. The earliest example is the "China United Reserve Bank" in North China, and the most recent example is the "China and Commercial Bank." Pseudo-钞 is fundamentally unprepared, so no matter how low the ratio of the value of pseudo-钞 to the legal currency is, as long as it has value, it can purchase foreign exchange. Therefore, these three aspects have a very large pressure on the exchange rate of the legal currency.

Regarding the needs of trade, the import surplus in the first four months of this year was about 4.5 million pounds in pounds. Among them, the import surplus in Shanghai was about 2.4 million pounds, accounting for one-half of the total import surplus. Therefore, the pressure on the Shanghai foreign exchange black market can be imagined. As mentioned earlier, trade needs are also making Japan gain foreign exchange, which is indeed the case. First, imports from Shanghai from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and "Manchukuo" totaled US$16 million in the first four months of this year, while exports from Shanghai to the above-mentioned regions totaled US$3 million. Undoubtedly, this difference of 1.3 million is of course sought in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market. Second, the amount of Shanghai flour sold to "Manchukuo" is very large, and its raw material - the import of wheat - is from the United States and Australia, and what is paid is foreign exchange, while the income of flour is Japanese yen, legal currency, and "Manchukuo currency." Third, cotton imports account for 20% of Shanghai's total imports, but 75% of the imported cotton is consumed by Shanghai's Japanese yarn factories, which indirectly gives Japan a way to obtain foreign exchange.

### Yarn and Cotton Northern Sales Stagnate, Yarn Prices Fall, There is no Shortage of Floating Longs to Close, Quotations Fall Again by Three Yuan

The yarn market has entered a revolving state. Since the madness, the actual needs have not been fully developed, and they are all in the hands of hoarding and transshipment. Recently, the Tianjin concession has been sealed off, the northern sales have stagnated, and the market situation is even more tired. General wealthy people are still absorbing at low prices. In terms of this situation, the market is dragged by it, but the actual sales are still not smooth. However, the price of raw materials is high, and the Tianjin gang sells 10 coarse yarns.

### Cotton Trade: Foreign Cotton Rather Booming

The market price of foreign cotton, especially New York cotton, showed a rather sluggish state yesterday. Due to sparse transactions at the opening, prices fell by three to five points. Discussions in Washington regarding the agricultural relief bill have yet to yield results, causing the industry to temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude. In these turbulent times, the rise and fall of cotton prices depend entirely on political news from various parties. The fluctuating nature of the New York cotton market makes it difficult to grasp. Yesterday, the closing price of New York cotton fell by five to ten points compared to the previous day's closing. Indian cotton, along with forecasts, also decreased by one rupee. Egyptian cotton rose slightly by three to five points.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, transactions by factories have become increasingly quiet. However, there is a strong consensus among traders, with frequent buying and selling among themselves, making transactions quite busy. Yesterday, due to the softening of overseas cotton markets, traders still inquired with foreign firms about prices. However, there were no orders. The total turnover of foreign cotton traders yesterday was about 2,000 bales. It is expected that Japanese factories will start moving foreign cotton within the day.

Local cotton transactions remain clear. However, the Japanese-owned Yufeng Factory continued to import 400 bales of American upland cotton. Other factories did not have much trading. However, the buying and selling of Indian cotton among traders has resumed flourishing. This business is resold to Japanese factories for offsetting transactions, so the selling price is increasing daily. Tongzhou local cotton has reached 90 yuan for delivery at the wharf, and Dachongji is even selling at 110 yuan. This is a distorted price development, a situation unseen in the history of the cotton industry. The supply from northern Jiangsu remains low, with only 108 bales of Xiassha cotton arriving at the docks. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:

Wholesale shops and hoarders on this street continued to handle over 3,000 pieces of dyed blank twill. Dyed and bleached cloth remained strong in the market, especially for autumn and winter goods. Transactions of thread, wool, serge, printed flannel, and other goods by wholesale shops and hoarders on this street continued with bulk deals being settled.

Buyers from Taizhou and Dongtai in northern Jiangsu handled eight hundred pieces of colored cloth and fine cloth.

Eastern Piece Goods: Yesterday, the spot prices of fine cloth and fine twill continued to soften, mainly because traders from Tianjin were still selling in the market. The morning market price of Longtou fine cloth fell to 14.20 yuan, and the later market price for this month returned to 14.35 yuan. The trading companies still haven't opened their goods. Fine twill also continued to fall by five cents to one dime. However, dyeing sales on this street and transactions among traders still amounted to about a thousand pieces.

### The Secret Key to Obtaining Happiness in Marital Life

In this modern age of medical and physiological advancements, the secret chamber of love has provided us with a key, allowing us to enter and examine the palace of truth at any time. The "hormones" within each person's body, secreted from one organ, affect other organs, affecting the entirety of an individual's life functions, and even more so in the lives of both sexes, affecting everything about the opposite sex, which also requires this kind of influence. Therefore, from the perspective of the lives of both sexes, women are merely a part of men, and men are merely a part of women. Only the combination of men and women can form a complete whole person.

In the lives of both sexes, the union of two people can not only satisfy the mutual desires of both parties, but also produce a kind of "wonderful creation" from this union. This creation not only refers to the children born from the love of men and women, but also refers to all kinds of supernatural entities arising from the complete integration of men and women. After both parties are bound by the threads of love, they become something new, completely different from when they were separate.

A young man and a young woman are moved by the attraction of almighty love, as if there is another vast and beautiful world before them, which can increase their various abilities, which cannot be measured by people who usually live alone. This is so glorious, great, and happy.

However, the number of truly happy men and women in the world is too small. Most people are mired in pain, and although there are many reasons for this, the English writer Mrs. Stopes said it all in one sentence: "If one were to properly study all aspects of marriage, one could achieve immortal achievements, and some people have done such research, but they all linger in the hazy darkness of abnormality, thus neglecting the needs of healthy, passionate people." Her meaning is that healthy passion is the secret key to happiness in the lives of both sexes.

Men and women in the world, because they do not know this secret key, either masturbate to induce nocturnal emissions before marriage, or indulge excessively after marriage, or even seek pleasure and cut themselves short, resulting in the loss of essence and blood. Therefore, symptoms such as forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, sore waist, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, and prolonged infertility arise one after another. If a husband is unable to fulfill his responsibilities for a long time, he will inevitably be resented by his wife, and the lives of both sexes will fall into a painful situation. The only way to remedy this is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Essence." This medicine can generate sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and invigorate the blood within 24 hours after taking it. The medicine is mild in nature and has the greatest effect. The above symptoms can be guaranteed to be treated in a short period. However, if patients have nocturnal emissions, they must also take "Hemet's Semen-Preserving Tablets" to consolidate the seminal gate and stop leakage. Being able to open sources and reduce expenditure will surely yield even more miraculous results!

Beauty

### The Breasts Are the Key to Female Beauty

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Soft breasts and arms, adorned like jade,

Full breasts and buttocks are the most glorious sight,

No wonder everyone loves them so much,

Selecting a new husband who suits their heart.

Aside from the old-fashioned, blind marriages that have been abandoned, modern men choose their spouses based on the other person's "sound physique" as the primary factor. As for their appearance, learning, and character, these are only secondary issues. From the perspective of us medical experts, this view is very important, because the entire undertaking of life, family happiness, and the strength of offspring are all directly or indirectly related to physique. If a wife has a sound physique, she can not only help her husband start a business and build a family, but also in the private life between husband and wife, she has fervent passion, which can also make her husband happy and joyful, and his spirit can obtain unlimited comfort. The family will be full of joy and give birth to clever children, and their happiness will be boundless.

But let's be clear. What counts as a sound physique for a woman? Many people do not yet have a full understanding of this point, but in the eyes of intelligent men, this is something that can be known at a glance. In general, a woman's sound physique can be determined by looking at her breasts and buttocks. If a woman's breasts are raised high and elastic, and her buttocks are plump and round, it can be determined that her gonadal ovarian function is healthy, her metabolism is vigorous, and her whole body is full of new cells. Naturally, she has no hidden diseases. On the contrary, if her breasts are withered, her buttocks are thin, and she has lost her beauty, then she has either committed self-abuse and chest binding, or suffers from menstrual irregularities and leucorrhea. Even if she has a face like a flower, she will be despised by modern men, and her fate will be very tragic! To seek remedy, one must only trust in science. According to world-renowned gynecologists and my own experience, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation "Germinal Essence" for women is the most appropriate and effective treatment. This preparation is carefully formulated. After taking it for one day and night, it can cultivate ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation and produce seeds, and in a short period of time, it can make the breasts rise, the buttocks plump, the cheeks rosy, and youth lasting.

### Nocturnal Emission Can Cause Physical and Mental Weakness

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Thanks to the advancement of medicine, we now know that the gonads in the endocrine system are extremely important to our body. The endocrine secretions of these gonads, in childhood, are irrigated throughout the body through blood circulation, presiding over the development of our body's appearance and weight. When spring feelings are aroused, a portion of these gonadal secretions are injected into the seminal vesicles to perform reproductive functions. If young people are unwise and cannot control the sexual impulses caused by the stimulation of these glands on the mind and body, or commit self-abuse, or indulge excessively in early marriage, leading to repeated nocturnal emissions, then these glands will inevitably be depleted due to massive consumption, and then the developmental function will stagnate, the metabolism will decline, and even though they have reached adulthood, their whole body will be like a child's. Furthermore, their face will be sallow and thin, their body and spirit will be withered, and their age will be young, but they will already be in a state of aging.

Therefore, young people must eradicate nocturnal emission as soon as possible. If they delay treatment or allow it to turn into spermatorrhea, not only will the above symptoms be unavoidable, but I am afraid that symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, sore waist, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, energy dissipation, thin sperm, and infertility will come one after another. Such young people will be abandoned by the opposite sex in the arena of love due to their withered body and spirit, unattractive appearance, and will fall into a tragic situation of unrequited love. Even in the marital life after marriage, it will not be satisfactory, and family life will be even more painful! At the same time, in today's fiercely competitive society, there is only the survival of the fittest, and they will be eliminated! To seek remedy, one must take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emissions, "Hemet's Semen-Preserving Tablets," to consolidate the seminal gate, calm the nerves, and allow for a sound sleep at night. Nocturnal emissions can be stopped immediately on the same night. If the patient already has the above symptoms due to nocturnal emission and indulgence, they must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, promote developmental function, and invigorate metabolism. If they can continue to take it, they will surely recover their beautiful health and be cured of all diseases! If patients come to my clinic for electrotherapy and injections, they can be guaranteed to be cured.

### Special Treatment Method for Redness, Swelling, and Pain in Gonorrhea

In the acute phase of gonorrhea, the glans and foreskin become red, swollen, and painful due to the irritation of the gonococcal toxin, which is a common symptom in the acute phase. The area around the urethral orifice of the patient is bound to become red, swollen, and painful. The severity of these symptoms is always related to the intensity of the gonococcus. If the toxicity is strong, the lower part of the urethral orifice, both sides of the frenulum of the penis, and even the entire foreskin, will show edematous swelling with a shiny appearance, accompanied by pain. However, the fluid accumulated in this swelling is similar to hydrocele of the scrotum and is not pus. If the disease has reached this point, the invasion of the toxin has spread to the paraurethral ducts, glands of Littre, and follicles. If these areas are indeed invaded by the toxin, then millet-sized to pea-sized swelling and induration will occur in these areas, which can be detected by palpation. As a result, the urethral cavity is obstructed and narrowed by this induration, making urination even more difficult.

To detect these conditions, a detailed examination should be performed with a new-style urethroscope to understand the true nature of the disease. Then, German Filtrin Pingliu electrotherapy is used to directly transmit to the lesion. Gonococci in the paraurethral ducts cannot be eliminated by local surgery alone. Only Filtrin electrotherapy can penetrate deep into the lesion. On the one hand, chemical therapy and specially made autogenous vaccines are used as injectables. In this way, all inflammatory and swelling symptoms will completely subside within one week, and the urethral induration can also be eliminated and restored to its original state in two weeks. This treatment method is the crystallization of my experience of more than ten years.

### The Dragon Boat Festival is Approaching: All Industries are Processing Accounts: Banks and Money Shops are Busy with Collections and Disbursements, Discount Rates Rise Sharply, But the Overall Financial Market Remains Stable as Ever

The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and all industries are starting to process accounts. For accounts within the city, invoices have been issued and collections are being urged. For accounts in other cities, the Chamber of Commerce issues certificates and dispatches personnel to collect them separately. The collection and disbursement of banks and money shops is busy due to the Dragon Boat Festival. The interbank lending rate in the market has risen to two cents, but yesterday it has fallen to 1.7 cents. The high interbank lending rate in the market is sufficient to prove the urgency of credit. The main reasons are: (1) The Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and all industries need to cope; (2) The black market exchange rate is tight, and firms hoard goods for profit; (3) Wheat, tea, and spring silk are entering the market, and all industries are preparing funds for purchases. As for the overall finance, it remains stable as ever. There is still a surplus of funds in the Shanghai market, and it is still difficult for banks and firms to use them. Good investment avenues are still narrow. The discount work of the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agricultural is proceeding as usual, with the aim of adjusting finance and supporting the development of all industries. As of the end of April, the loan balance was over 140 million yuan. Loans directly issued by the association accounted for 92% of the total amount, loans handled by the Bank Joint Reserve Committee accounted for slightly less than 4%, and loans handled by the Money Shop Joint Reserve accounted for slightly more than 4%.

Danish Consul General Acts as Senior Consul

The Public Works Department recently received a notice stating that the Italian Consul General and Senior Consul Nilo would be temporarily leaving Shanghai from the 18th of this month. At that time, the duties of Senior Consul will be performed by the Danish Consul General Scheel.

Two British Ships Sail to Tianjin Today

Passengers Disembark in Tanggu After Arriving in Tianjin

Since the British and French concessions in Tianjin were blockaded by the Japanese army on the morning of the 14th, British ships going to Tianjin from this city have stopped loading goods. Jardine Matheson's Ding Sheng was scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Tianjin the day before yesterday (the 15th), and all the Tianjin goods that had been loaded in advance were temporarily returned to customs, as reported in the previous newspaper. Today, two ships, Taikoo's Shengjing and Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng Xin, are scheduled to depart for Tianjin at 10:30 am. The Shengjing is only carrying some goods for Qingdao and Yantai, and no Tianjin goods at all, not even Tanggu goods. However, the Yong Sheng Xin is still carrying several thousand bags of Tanggu flour. Passengers are still allowed, but they must disembark in Tanggu. Therefore, the situation in the Tianjin concession remains tense.

### To Remedy the Coin Shortage in Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance Has a Fundamental Solution: It Will Approve the Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes for Circulation: The Issuance of Vouchers by Businesses Will Be Discontinued: The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association Seeks Opinions

Copper coins and copper cash in the Shanghai market are extremely scarce due to being hoarded by unscrupulous merchants for profit, making it extremely inconvenient for small transactions in various industries. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request a quick remedy. Today, the Ministry of Finance has approved the shipment of new subsidiary currency to Shanghai for relief. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from banking circles that the Ministry of Finance has determined a fundamental relief method for the shortage of copper coins in Shanghai: it will approve the issuance of fractional currency notes by banks, which is the same method used to deal with the shortage of copper cash in the interior. However, the fractional currency notes in the interior are issued by provincial banks or local banks. In Shanghai, they are to be issued by the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agricultural. It is still impossible to find out the details, but the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank said that it has not received any telegram orders from the Chongqing headquarters regarding the shipment of new subsidiary currency to Shanghai and the issuance of fractional currency notes for circulation. As for the plan for various businesses to issue their own vouchers, because the Ministry of Finance has a remedy, they will all be discontinued. The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association, the commercial center of this city, believes that since the reduction of copper cash and one-cent coins, both citizens and businesses have felt difficulty. It intends to print a temporary voucher for distribution to various businesses on Nanjing Road for use in making change. Once the government's new subsidiary currency arrives in Shanghai, this temporary voucher will be canceled. To be cautious, the association has sent letters to various businesses yesterday seeking opinions, with items such as "extremely necessary" and "still manageable" in the inquiry letter, asking the businesses to check and reply within three days so that a decision can be made. As for the name of this temporary voucher, whether it is a voucher or another name, it remains to be discussed and decided. Since the wave of copper cash shortage began, various road public groups have, at the request of businesses, had discussions on issuing temporary vouchers. However, opinions from various parties are divided, as it is feared that unscrupulous people will imitate and deceive, leading to more malpractices and making it difficult to handle the aftermath. However, the efforts of business groups to reduce the difficulties of merchants are worthy of admiration.

Cixi Urban Area Bombed Again

Ningbo Also Has Air Raid Alarm: Japanese Planes Also Enter the Teeth

Cixi was bombed by Japanese planes in the ordnance area on the 1st of this month. After an interval of only two weeks, Japanese planes bombed Cixi City again at noon on the 14th. On that day, there were four Japanese planes taking off from Longshan on the sea in Zhenbei, and they dropped a bomb at the foot of Longshan Mountain, with no losses. After circling once, the Japanese planes attacked the Cixi urban area, dropping bombs successively in the west of the city, at Yongming Temple, and at Cixi Middle School on the bank of Cihu Lake in the northern suburbs. Dozens of houses were destroyed, and the number of deaths and injuries is unknown. After wreaking havoc, the Japanese planes fled back along the original route. When the Japanese planes bombed Cixi that day, Ningbo also issued an air raid alarm, followed by an emergency alarm. Later, because the Japanese planes did not enter the territory, the alarm was lifted at 12:12 pm.

### Columbia University Professor's Impressions of Visiting Western China: Praises the Great Spirit of the Chinese People: Discovers the Determination for Long-Term Resistance Everywhere

Columbia University Professor Auchter, author of famous works on Far Eastern events, recently returned to the United States via Shanghai after visiting western and northwestern China with his wife. Professor Auchter recently made a broadcast speech to the United States in Chongqing, stating that China in 1932 was very different from China today, and that China had the ability to continue resisting Japanese aggression. A few days ago, I came to Huaxi, Sichuan Province, from Hong Kong, hoping to find out how a country that has suffered heavy losses can resist aggressors. Now I have found the answer here in Chongqing. Chongqing used to be the commercial export center of Sichuan Province. Now it suddenly became

Wartime China

The political center of Within a few months of abandoning Hankou, the population increased from 250,000 to over 500,000. Overcrowding is inevitable. Construction of government offices, residences, factories, and university buildings is underway everywhere. Whether building houses or air-raid shelters, the ground must first be leveled manually. Therefore, the sound of hammering and chiseling to remove

The sound of sandstone

Is endless, In addition to cars, rickshaws, and shoulder carriages on the streets, there are also coolies and handcarts transporting the necessary building materials, so pedestrians and vehicles are constantly flowing. Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces are not only the base of political activities, but also the area of ​​industrial revolution. The mineral and industrial resources are now under investigation. The factories that were suddenly moved out of the war zone are also being rebuilt. I have visited several factories and am impressed by their attitude of overcoming insurmountable difficulties.

Quite surprised

It should be known that the equipment of the factory was transported after trekking thousands of miles. At the same time, handicrafts are encouraged to supplement the lack of factory industry. Now I do not want to give the audience the impression that China has solved its economic difficulties. On the one hand, China continues to rely on the self-sufficient economy of these three provinces. On the other hand, it recruits people from other provinces to supply the army, export surplus products, establish foreign exchange, and rebuild a new economy that cannot be completed in one day and night from within. China also needs to obtain more from the outside world than it currently has.

Greater assistance

I found the spirit of the people of Chongqing to be more profoundly impressive than the material achievements. They did not talk about concessions or peace talks. Everywhere I encountered, they were optimistic and had a calm determination to resist indefinitely. I cannot praise the great spirit of the Chinese people in words. The unity produced in the war was not seen when I went to China in 1932. Provincial boundaries have been completely eliminated, and a magnificent and powerful national spirit is being forged. Our feeling is that China is a country of 500 million people who refuse to be conquered.

Occupational Guilds Evacuate Refugees

The Board of Directors will meet today

The International Sixth Shelter was originally located in the Qianye Guild Hall at the intersection of Beihainan Road and Haining Road, which housed more than 600 refugees, women and children, from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Now, the Qianye Guild Hall plans to convert the place into a hospital and school, and has issued a notice preparing to evacuate the refugees in the shelter. The refugees in the shelter have launched representatives Ma Nanshan, Shen Liangjun, Ye Yangwu, etc. to petition Qianye leaders Qin Runqing and others to show compassion for the refugees and exempt them from relocation. It was learned yesterday that the Board of Directors of the Qianye Guild Hall has scheduled a meeting today to discuss and decide on the relocation of the shelter.

### Spring Cocoon Transport to Shanghai Blocked; Silk Factories Completely Shut Down; Failure to Deliver June Futures as Agreed; "Central China Company" Attempts to Dominate China's Silk Industry

Since the "Central China Silk Company" abandoned collecting cocoons in villages and towns and permitted Shanghai manufacturers to set up shops to collect cocoons in villages and towns, various factories, in order to maintain operations, have risked buying spring cocoons from various places. Now, the cocoon season in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has passed, and cocoon shops have successively stopped weighing cocoons. Just as manufacturers were preparing to load cocoons onto vehicles for transport to Shanghai, they were suddenly blocked by the "Central China Company." After various manufacturers negotiated with the "Central China Company," the company initially agreed to handle the matter after its Japanese general manager returned to Shanghai from Japan. Now, although the Japanese general manager has returned to Shanghai, the blocked cocoons have still not been released.

Shanghai Factories Forced to Shut Down

There are thirty-six silk reeling factories within the concession area, all of which had fully commenced operations. Later, due to a shortage of raw material cocoons, they were forced to shut down one after another. It was originally planned to resume operations after the spring cocoons came on the market, but now, because the cocoons they collected are blocked, and their existing cocoon stock has been exhausted, only a few factories, such as Jardine, Yue Hing, Fook Lun, Zhen Lun, and Shanghai, are勉强勉强operating. All other factories have completely shut down. Even those factories that are勉强勉强maintaining operations have a limited amount of raw materials. It is expected that if the problem of transporting spring cocoons to Shanghai is not resolved before the end of this month, all silk factories in Shanghai will be forced to shut down completely.

Failure to Deliver Futures; Disputes Arise

According to past practice, silk factories sell futures contracts for silk produced after the spring cocoons come on the market to foreign firms engaged in the export of Chinese silk. After each factory collects spring cocoons, they reel silk and deliver the goods according to the contract. Factories in the Shanghai concession have sold a considerable amount of June and July futures contracts. Now, because the transport of spring cocoons to Shanghai is blocked, various factories are unable to start reeling silk, and the futures contracts that should be delivered on time cannot be fulfilled as agreed. As a result, minor disputes have arisen between manufacturers and foreign firms. However, because the manufacturers are helpless and the situation is beyond their control, the foreign firms have agreed to postpone delivery until the spring cocoons are released.

Attempt to Dominate China's Silk Industry

In recent years, China's silk reeling industry has shown signs of revival, which the Japanese are extremely jealous of. Now that the silk-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been occupied, they are naturally doing their best to suppress the industry, attempting to dominate China's silk business. The current obstruction of spring cocoons being transported to Shanghai is one of their policies. Currently, in addition to trying to start silk reeling operations in factories in Wuxi, the "Central China Company" is further attempting to seize silk factories in Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Haining, and other places. This is ostensibly called cooperation, but in reality is seizing control. At the same time, they are also attempting to monopolize the European and American silk markets.

### Speculators Manipulate Rice Prices; Nearing the 20 Yuan Mark; Hope Authorities Take Strict Measures to Crack Down; Also Dredge Sources to Maintain Food Supply for the People

Due to the manipulation of speculators, the price of rice in the Shanghai rice market has soared, breaking the 19-yuan mark. After the Market Management Committee advised the speculators, the market stabilized slightly the day before yesterday, and the speculators accepted the advice and released their hoarded rice. However, after the market opened yesterday, speculators took the opportunity to buy back in, causing prices to rise again. Top-grade white rice was 19.8 yuan, nearing the 20-yuan mark. The price of rice in the market has been manipulated by speculators, and the rise and fall of prices depends entirely on the buying and selling of speculators. If this continues, it will greatly affect the people's food supply. Various rice industry associations have stated that, under special circumstances, cracking down on speculators is beyond their power. They can only hope that the concession authorities will formulate measures to curb speculation and also dredge the prevention of rice from being exported from production areas.

Sweden Celebrates the King's Birthday

Swedish Consulate Hosted a Banquet Yesterday

The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that Swedish King Gustaf V is celebrating his 81st birthday today (the 16th). The Swedish Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Cronwall, hosted a banquet at his residence at No. 101 Route Massenet, starting at 7 p.m. tonight, to celebrate with the Swedish community in Shanghai. It is noted that the Swedish King ascended the throne in 1907.

### Japanese Troops Arrested More Than a Dozen Chinese in Zhabei Yesterday; Allegedly Related to Certain Unstable Cases

For days, Japanese troops have been wantonly arresting Chinese residents in the occupied areas, such as Hongkou and Zhabei, and detaining them for interrogation. The details of the cases are not made public. Yesterday morning, at around 9 a.m., more than a dozen Chinese, who looked like coolies, were arrested by Japanese troops and plainclothes detectives in a shed on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei. At the same time, they also conducted searches in the surrounding area, but reportedly found nothing. It is said that some of these dozen Chinese are suspected of being involved in unstable cases and were arrested due to informers.

Ding Le Case Continues to be Investigated

Testimony from Two Witnesses

The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that the British Coroner Haynes continued the inquiry into the Ding Le case this morning (the 16th). Mr. Grant, an engineer at the Lun Chang Company, testified that he saw about thirty striking picketers on the pontoon from the office building of the Lun Chang Textile Factory. He rushed to the factory gate and saw Japanese marines, led by a sergeant, climbing over the wall from the adjacent courtyard into the Lun Chang Factory. They opened the gate to allow striking workers and good workers who arrived at the same time to enter the factory. As soon as they entered the factory, the Japanese soldiers separated the strikers from other workers. At a shout, the strikers rushed to the headquarters of the factory. The witness tried to stop the strikers to prevent the good workers from being harmed, but he was stopped by the Japanese sergeant, who said that both striking and non-striking Chinese workers must be taken away. The witness went to close the factory gate and, when he returned, saw Mr. Ding leaving the factory, led by Japanese soldiers.

Another Witness

Lubetzky, a supervisor at the Lun Chang Textile Factory, testified that he saw a Japanese soldier stab Mr. Ding in the lower left body with a bayonet, while other Japanese soldiers were beating Mr. Ding in front. At this point, the Coroner adjourned the court and scheduled the hearing to resume at 2:15 p.m.

### Shipping Increasingly Prosperous; Shortage of Floating Docks in the Huangpu River; Foreign Ships Loading Foreign Wheat from Australia; Must Wait Three or Four Days Before Entering the Port

Floating docks are important facilities for ships. The city's Huangpu River banks are lined with docks, and there are also many floating docks in the river. Starting from outside the Garden Bridge and extending to the Donggou River surface, the Customs has established forty-four floating docks. From the Bund near 16 Pupu to the Rihui Port on the Huangpu River in the south, the Public Security Bureau's dock warehouse management office has also established more than twenty floating docks, as well as floating docks set up by the China Merchants, Taikoo, and Jardine companies. Therefore, there has never been a worry about ships being unable to enter, moor, or dock.

Pudong Blockade; Cannot Dock

Since the August 13th Incident, the docks and floating docks south of 16 Pupu have been blockaded and cannot be used for docking. On the Pudong side, the Taikoo Wharf in Yangjiadu, the Hongxing Wharf, the British Longmao Wharf, and the Qichang Wharf and Blue Funnel Wharf to the east have resumed docking. Customs floating docks No. 1 to No. 8 and No. 36 to No. 44 are still occupied for military use.

Increased Number of Incoming Ships

Due to the recent increase in the number of incoming ships loading foreign wheat and foreign cotton, there is a shortage of floating docks for docking. Sometimes, there is no space at the docks and floating docks, and ships have to wait three or four days outside Wusong before entering the port to unload cargo. This loss is also considerable.

Foreign Ships to Shanghai; Temporarily Anchor Outside the Port

Recently, the Sithonia and Mount Helmos, two ships managed by the Tianxiang Shipping Company, arrived from Australia with 16,000 tons of foreign wheat on the 6th of this month. Because there was no space at the docks and floating docks in the Huangpu River, they anchored outside Wusong to wait. They only entered the port to unload the wheat on the 9th and 11th. Now, the Rilev, managed by Jardine Shipping Company, has also loaded 8,857.5 tons of foreign wheat from Australia and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. Again, because the docks and floating docks are not available, the company has telegraphed the ship to anchor outside Wusong to wait until next Tuesday (the 20th) before it can enter the port. It can be seen that there is currently a shortage of floating docks in the Huangpu River.

The Municipal Council Wharf is Extremely Crowded

As for the docks of the foreign Municipal Council, only small ferries and barges docked there before the war. Now, ships sailing to various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are all docking at this wharf. Therefore, the Council has specially set up a dock donation office outside Wuma Road on the Bund to manage dock affairs. Therefore, there has recently been a shortage of both floating docks and docks in the Huangpu River, and the shipping industry is greatly affected. The anti-aircraft gunners who shot down a Japanese plane in Zhenhai have made great contributions. Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government has commended them and awarded them a special reward of 10,000 national currency.

Progress in Negotiations with Portuguese Ships

Regarding the detention of more than ten Portuguese merchant ships, including the Tangbei, Tanglu, Tangqiao, Meda, Hailong, Fulu, and Shide, by the Japanese Navy, the former Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Alves, repeatedly protested and negotiated without result. Since Mr. Alves was transferred to New York, the case has been continued by the new Consul, Mr. Melo, who has continued to negotiate on the basis of reason. At the same time, the Japanese Navy has agreed to investigate whether the ships are indeed of Portuguese nationality, and the situation seems to have taken a new turn. According to reports from Daguang News reporters to the shipping industry, the Portuguese Consulate received a notice from the Japanese Navy yesterday stating that the commander of the Japanese Navy has now arrived in Shanghai and asked the Portuguese Consul to meet with him at 2:30 p.m. The Portuguese Consul complied and went to the meeting yesterday. However, the Consulate has not yet released the results. However, shipping merchants speculate that the case may be resolved soon.

### Safe Driving Week to Start Tomorrow; Radio Stations to Broadcast Special Programs; Cinemas to Show Safety Films

The Public Concession's Safe Driving Week is scheduled to begin tomorrow and last until the 24th. In addition to posting slogans on all types of vehicles in the city, the committee has also requested Chinese and foreign radio stations to broadcast special Safe Driving Week programs, featuring Shanghai storytellers and ballad singers. Cinemas will also show films specially produced by the committee. Yesterday, the committee specially posted picture flyers on various roads to attract the attention of citizens, including: (1) Caution can avoid danger, carelessness can easily cause accidents; (2) Do not walk in the middle of the road, use the sidewalk; (3) Only cross the road along the yellow safety line when the green light is on; (4) Do not rush across the road in front of a stopped streetcar or bus; (5) Do not cross the road between parked vehicles; (6) Do not call for rickshaws from across the road; (7) Be sure to look left and right before crossing the road.

### Japanese Warships Burn and Pillage Fishing Boats off the Coast of Zhenhai; Warship No. 1 Patrols the Waters of Hengshanbu; Puppet "Maintenance Association" Established in Daishan

According to shipping industry sources, on the afternoon of the 13th, two Japanese warships searched civilian ships off the coast of Zhenhai. One fishing boat was burned. On Daishan Island, a puppet "Maintenance Association" has been established by traitors since the Japanese troops landed. The details are as follows:

Two Japanese Warships Burn and Pillage Fishing Boats

At around 3 p.m. on the 12th, a Japanese warship sailed to the sea near Chuanshan, outside Zhenhai, near Lindashan, and anchored there. At around 2 p.m. on the 13th, another Japanese warship arrived. After the two warships met, they launched speedboats to search civilian ships in the nearby waters. One fishing boat was seized and then set on fire. At around 6 p.m., one warship weighed anchor and sailed away, while the other remained anchored in place. It was also learned that at 7:25 a.m. on the 13th, a gray Japanese warship with two funnels sailed to the Dongqi Shan waters in Xiangshan Port. At 7:40 a.m., it sailed to Hutou Bay to anchor. It launched a small speedboat to patrol back and forth, but there was no other movement. At 8:30 a.m., it sailed to the waters of Hengshanbu to anchor. At 8:50 a.m., it sailed to Dongqi Gate.

### Shanghai Disaster Area Rehabilitation and Public Bonds; Principal and Interest Repaid on Schedule; The Thirteenth Lottery Has Been Held; The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation to Pay Principal and Interest

Xin Sheng News reporters learned from banking circles yesterday that the fund for these bonds, except for the wharves in the occupied area, is still collected and managed by the fund committee, so principal and interest are repaid as usual. The thirteenth lottery was held at 4 p.m. on the 14th of this month at the Shanghai Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. A total of one lottery was drawn, No. 33, with a principal amount of 60,000 national currency, together with the thirteenth interest coupon, which is allowed to be paid by the bank starting from the 15th of this month, with a six-year limit.

### Hongkou Car Crash Case Verdict; Li Li's Rashness Caused Death; The Japanese Sentry's Rash Actions Were Also a Cause of Li Li's Death; Wimsett Attended Court with a Cane to Testify

The "China Press" reports that Li Li, the headmaster of the Lester School, crashed his car with a Japanese bus near Broadway Road and Minhang Road on the night of April 24. Li Li and a Japanese sentry died from serious injuries. Li Li's wife and Mr. Wimsett, a Western police officer from the police station, who were in the same car, have recovered from their injuries. The case was continued yesterday (the 15th) by British Coroner Haynes. Mr. Wimsett, a witness, testified in court with a cane, stating that at around 8:35 p.m. on April 24, he was on duty at the south end of the Garden Bridge, when a foreign man and woman (now known to be Li Li and his wife) stopped their car in front of him and said that they had hit an obstacle on the north bank of the bridge. The witness got into the car and drove back with them. When they arrived at Broadway Bridge, Li Li's wife recognized that they had collided with an obstacle on the bridge, so they stopped the car and talked to the Japanese sentry at the bridgehead. The Japanese soldier did not understand English. After a while, Li Li agreed to drive to the Hongkou police station and drove slowly to the top of the bridge to indicate to the Japanese

sentry that he was driving to the Hongkou police station. When the car drove off the bridge, it was driving quite fast. Suddenly, two Japanese sentries jumped onto the left and right running boards next to the driver's seat. The sentry on the right grabbed the steering wheel with both hands, and the sentry on the left also leaned into the car window towards the steering wheel. Li Li's left hand left the wheel and pushed him away. The sentry then stood straight on the running board. At that time, Li Li put the speedometer in second gear, and the sentry on the right turned the steering wheel left and right, causing the car to travel in a curved line along Broadway Road. Li Li

tried to correct it. When the car was near the corner of Zha Pu Road, the front and rear wheels on the left side drove onto the sidewalk on the left side and then reversed into Broadway Road. Suddenly, the witness felt a jolt and leaned forward, hitting the back of Li Li's seat with his nose, and lost consciousness. When he woke up, he was in the hospital. At that time, the car was traveling at 15 miles per hour. Li Li was conscious, but did not try to stop the car. At this point, the coroner adjourned the court. According to the English-language "North China Daily News," British Coroner Haynes opened the inquiry into the Li Li case this morning (the 16th).

After reviewing the testimony, the verdict was that Li Li died due to his reckless actions. The reckless actions of the Japanese sentry turning the steering wheel, when he should have stopped the car, were also a cause of Li Li's death. Mr. Haynes also stated that he had asked the Japanese Marines to send someone to testify in court, but unfortunately no one attended. As for the driver of the bus that collided with Li Li's car, he was not at fault.

### The Japanese Side Claims to Have Captured the Leader of an Arson Group

The news agency Shen Wen She reports that the Japanese side announced yesterday that the fires in Hongkou have been identified as the work of an anti-Japanese arson group. As a result of the investigation by the Japanese military police, they have obtained all the information about the group and captured its members, including Wang Genbao and Mao Huzi. On May 27, they captured the mastermind of the group, Yu Yilan, who is 30 years old. He infiltrated Hongkou in early May and recruited workers from various factories as members of his group. On May 9, Yu ordered the members to set fires in various locations, including: Warehouse No. 2 of Shanghai Textile Factory No. 4 at No. 585 Lane, Shenxin Textile Factory on Henan Road, Warehouse No. 37Y of Gonghexian Wharf, Gongqin Iron Factory on Linqing Road, Kangtai Weaving Factory on Huade Road, Meihua Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 640 Hejian Road, and Hengfeng Textile Factory on Huasheng Road.

### Colluding with Friends to Set a Trap, Falsely Accusing Wife of Adultery, Original Sentence Revoked After Investigation, Pang Qingbao Cannot Escape the Law

Pang Qingbao, a native of Nanjing and owner of the Xiao Leyi Restaurant at 490 Zhejiang Road, previously married Cao Fuzhen, a woman from Liuhe, and they had children. However, in recent years, the relationship between the couple had deteriorated significantly, with frequent disputes and complications arising. Cao had previously filed a complaint with the Liuhe County government accusing Pang Qingbao of abandonment, while Pang accused his wife of adultery with a shop employee named Hu. Last year, Pang, at the instigation of his friend Lu Zhicheng, became acquainted with a woman and cohabited with her at a certain address in Dexingfang, Gansu Road. Cao learned of this and, together with her aunt,

went to catch them in the act. However, Pang quickly escaped, and they did not find him, but only saw Lu Zhicheng inside the room. At the time, Cao, angered by Lu's instigation of her husband, slapped him twice. Then, on November 19 of last year, Pang Qingbao suddenly reported to the Old Zha Gate police station, claiming that his wife Cao and Lu Zhicheng were having an affair and were currently secluded in room 320 of the Far East Hotel, requesting their arrest. The police sent detectives to the hotel, where they indeed found Cao and Lu in the room, and

there was still evidence of inappropriate behavior on the bed. The evidence was conclusive, and they were jointly sued in the Special District Court No. 1. Cao testified in court that she had gone to the Far East Hotel at her husband's invitation to take a bath, not expecting that he was setting a trap for her, the real reason being Pang's extramarital affair. Lu Zhicheng not only did not deny the accusation but directly confessed, showing no shame. The judge sentenced Pang, Cao, and Lu Zhicheng to three months of imprisonment each, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day. Upon hearing the verdict, Lu immediately stated that he would waive his right to appeal, while Cao, believing that the entire matter

was a conspiracy between her husband and Lu Zhicheng to intentionally frame her, refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court Second Branch. After a detailed examination by the High Court and an on-site inspection of the Far East Hotel, it was determined that there was various evidence that indicated suspicions, clearly a deliberately arranged setup. The original verdict was overturned, and Pang and Cao were declared innocent. The Procuratorate of the Special District Court No. 1 also took this case very seriously, fearing the consequences if such behavior were to become widespread. Therefore, Prosecutor Song Gunshan initiated an investigation into the false accusation by Pang Qingbao and Lu Zhicheng.

Because Lu's whereabouts were unknown, the summons could not be served, and the proceedings were temporarily suspended. As for Pang Qingbao, it was deemed that there was indeed suspicion of false accusation, and he was ordered to find a guarantor to be released. A public prosecution for false accusation was filed with the criminal court of the same level. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Peishen presided over the second criminal court to conduct the hearing. The Shanghai Municipal Council also sent lawyer Jiang Baolian to attend the hearing. After Prosecutor Song stated the reasons for the prosecution, Pang Qingbao insisted that his wife's adultery was a fact. Under questioning by Judge Xiao, the case was adjourned for further verification.

### Qi Linsheng Accused of Seduction Case, Firmly Claiming Fabrication and False Accusation, Stating Willingness to Behead and Confess if Such a Thing Happened, Court Orders Summons of Witnesses and Adjourns for Further Hearing

Chen Wang, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 1 Wufeng Lane, Lyuban Road, Xiafei Road, previously engaged lawyer Hu Yongsheng to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special District Court No. 2, accusing Qi Linsheng, a medical doctor from Shangcheng, Henan, of abducting her 19-year-old daughter, Chen Sanyuan, on October 7 of last year, persuading her to leave home and concealing her at No. 522 Beile Road for illicit relations until April 12 of this year, when she was finally found on the street and brought home. She requested that Qi be prosecuted for disrupting family morality and also filed a civil suit seeking compensation and alimony of 3,000 yuan. Qi also engaged a lawyer to defend himself and

filed a countersuit for false accusation. After several court hearings presided over by Judge Liao Yuan, the defendant vehemently denied the accusations, claiming they were based on grudges and fabricated. The court ordered an adjournment to summon witnesses for further questioning. This case was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the court held another hearing to continue the trial. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. First, the witness Wang Shuiquan testified that he was 30 years old, from Beijing, and lived in the pavilion room upstairs at No. 522 Beile Road, Shunchang Coal Store. He worked as a performer at the Grand Stage and did not know the plaintiff. He knew the defendant because his wife had been ill before, and he had asked him to see her, owing him some medical expenses. In October of last year, the defendant came to him to rent a room, saying it was for his concubine, who had no place to live,

staying there for a few days, with a bed opposite, paying ten yuan per month for rent and food. The defendant himself often came and went. Qi Linsheng stated that the witness Wang Shuiquan was the plaintiff Chen Wang's younger brother, so of course, he would help her speak, completely fabricating and making things up. He asked the court to investigate thoroughly and stated that if he had indeed committed any illegal acts, he would be willing to behead himself and confess. The defendant's defense lawyer requested that Zhang Shucheng, who had originally introduced the defendant to the plaintiff to prescribe medicine for smoking cessation, be summoned to court for questioning. The court approved this request and adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of the 26th for further questioning of witnesses.

According to the plaintiff, she married the defendant in April 1935 and had a son and a daughter. Initially, their relationship was good, but later, due to the defendant's extramarital affair, he treated her as an enemy.

Not long after returning home, the old habits resurfaced, and he often beat her. On April 3 of this year, she was beaten severely again. After reporting to the police, she stated that the defendant's behavior made it impossible to stay together for the rest of her life and therefore sought permission for a divorce and requested 500 yuan in alimony.

On September 20 of last year, he was instructed by manager Tang Qifu to deliver a Huaqiao Bank immediate payment check for 7,290 yuan to Dasheng Yarn Company on Nanjing Road. However, Wang cashed the check and absconded with the money. Tang reported the incident to the General Police Station, offering a reward of 1,000 yuan for his arrest. He was finally captured by Tang the day before yesterday at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road. Detective Song Yuanxi of the Chinese police arrested Wang and took him to the General Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of Special District Court No. 1. Police lawyer Bo Liangru Bao Yi charged him with professional embezzlement. Due to the need for further investigation, a postponement was requested.

He asked the plaintiff to return home and expressed his remorse to the plaintiff, asking her to forgive him once more. If he beats her again in the future, it will be considered a condition for divorce, allowing her to divorce him and bear the losses. The plaintiff also stated that she had been beaten hundreds of times since marrying the defendant.

### International Exchange Center Unchanged, Shanghai Still Holds Financial Hub, Industry, Commerce and Real Estate Are Quite Active, Inland Funds Return to Shanghai Market

The Shanghai Banking Association Joint Preparation Committee's business report for 1938, as summarized by the Xinsheng News reporter, is as follows: This year, the war spread, and Shanghai's environment was more difficult than ever before. Shanghai, which has always been the national financial hub, has seen its position and situation change. The reasons why it has still been able to maintain its traditional importance are: First, international exchange is still centered in Shanghai, and transactions are still flourishing. Second, the authorities of the two special districts have spared no effort to maintain the city's safety and welfare. Small-scale industry, commerce, and real estate within the concessions are quite active. Third, refugees from all over the country have flocked here, increasing the population within the concessions. Funds that flowed into the interior in previous years have now concentrated in Shanghai again, and bank deposits have all increased.

(A) Joint Preparation Department

Committee Banks: Hengli Bank temporarily suspended business on August 9 of last year and withdrew from the association. On October 4 of this year, the bank reorganized and resumed business in accordance with the law, and rejoined the association on the same day. On November 21, Tonghe Bank announced its closure and withdrew from the association. This year, the number of committee banks remains at 33. Due to the current situation, the regular meeting of the representatives of the committee banks has not yet been convened after the last settlement.

Prepared Assets: According to the total amount of prepared assets deposited by the banks at the end of this year, the amount is 57,715,043.56 yuan in national currency, which is a decrease of 1,932,560.16 yuan compared with the end of 1937. The total amount of all preparations was 62.01% of the total assessed value in the previous settlement and 62.44% of the total assessed value in the next settlement. According to the number of the next settlement, the classification of assets is as follows: real estate accounts for 86.50% of the total amount, foreign securities account for 6.51%, and domestic government bonds account for 6.99%.

Document Lending: According to the total number of documents received by the banks at the end of the year, the amount is 36,014,800 yuan in national currency, which is a decrease of 464,400 yuan compared with the end of 1937. In the upper half of this year's settlement, the total amount of public loan lending was 299,708,000 yuan in national currency, which is an increase of more than 234.6 million yuan compared with the upper half of 1937. In the lower half of the settlement, the total amount of public loan lending was 386,091,000 yuan in national currency, which is an increase of more than 142.6 million yuan compared with the lower half of 1937. The above-mentioned total lending amount is the cumulative number of each day. This year, due to a small number of colleagues continuing to borrow, the total amount is much larger than last year. The interest rate for public loan funds averaged three cents in national currency for the first half of the year, and two cents for exchange transfers. The average interest rate for the second half of the year was 2.58 cents in national currency, and two cents for exchange transfers.

Acceptance Discount: This year, the total discount on accepted drafts by the association was 9,850,000 yuan in national currency, which is a decrease of 860,000 yuan compared with 1937. The discounted bills that have not yet expired by the end of the year total 2 million yuan in national currency. The association's acceptance draft discount rate, based on 90-day drafts as a standard, had an annual average rate of 2.78 cents in national currency and two cents for exchange transfers.

Interbank Lending: Starting on August 17 of last year, the association handled interbank exchange transfers. At that time, the Shanghai war had just begun, and the industry needed a large amount of funds to prepare for withdrawals. Therefore, the amount of lending gradually increased, reaching more than 8.34 million yuan at most. This year, due to the increase in deposits in various banks, the industry's capital was more abundant than before. The association's lending amount has gradually decreased. At the end of June, the association's lending balance was 4,513,608 yuan in national currency. At the end of the year, the lending balance was 3,740,800 yuan. The average lending rate for the whole year was 2.2 cents. The association's interbank exchange transfers were originally complementary to the clearing and exchange transfers handled by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications Four Bank Lending Committee. This year, in order to concentrate on dealing with the situation, all lending applications from various banks were largely entrusted by the association to handle on behalf of the committee. The amount of lending and collateral was still jointly approved by the four banks. As of the end of the year, the total amount of loans made by the association on behalf of the four banks was 1,620,000 yuan in national currency, including 600,000 yuan for clearing loans and 1,020,000 yuan for exchange transfer loans.

Exchange Transfer Discount: Since the fact that exchange transfer discounts and cash-outs occurred in the market, the initial discount per thousand yuan was only six or seven yuan. Since the government announced foreign exchange control in March, the discount gradually rose to thirty or forty yuan. At the same time, the general demand for legal currency increased, and the amount of legal currency in circulation in the market became increasingly scarce. In April, the association was entrusted by the Central Bank to try to adjust the situation as appropriate, but for a time, there was still a shortage of supply. On May 7, the discount per thousand yuan rose to as high as seventy-nine yuan. At that time, the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications entrusted the association to maintain the market as much as possible. The market discount was stabilized at around fifty yuan. The process is as described above. In November, Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another, and people were uneasy, causing the discount to rise to over sixty yuan again. It soon returned to around forty-five yuan, and by the end of the year, it had fallen to thirty-eight or thirty-nine yuan, and the market had stabilized. The association's exchange transfer bill discount rate was determined by the association after reviewing the market at any time in consultation with the three banks.

Interbank Deposits: Banks, trust companies, and money houses other than exchange banks opened accounts with the association for the convenience of clearing bills, either due to loan transfers or for the convenience of clearing bills. This type of deposit is listed in the interbank deposit item in the association's balance sheet. The total deposit balance at the end of the year was 7,523,297.36 yuan, of which clearing deposits accounted for 35.19% and exchange transfer deposits accounted for 64.81%.

(B) Bill Exchange Department

Exchange Banks: Due to environmental reasons, Shanghai City Bank temporarily suspended business on February 5 of this year. The association stopped its bill exchange from the same day. After Guangdong Bank reorganized and resumed business last year, the association originally acted as its exchange agent. On March 1 of this year, it joined as an exchange bank. On July 4, the Coal Industry Bank and Zhengming Bank simultaneously entrusted the association to act as their exchange agent. On October 4, Hengli Bank reorganized and resumed business, and entrusted the association to act as its exchange agent on the same day. On November 21, Tonghe Bank announced its closure and withdrew from the exchange. In addition, some branches of various banks in the city were still closed or merged this year. As of the end of the year, the number of exchange banks in the association remained at 36. The number of banks entrusting the association to act as their exchange agent was 10, an increase of one compared with last year. The number of branches of various banks in the city participating in the exchange was 77, a decrease of 11 compared with last year. (To be continued)

### Kidnapping of Ma Hongji's Accountant; Over 1,000 Yuan Paid for Ransom; Japanese Soldiers Indiscriminately Arrest Innocent Villagers

Ma Hongji, the "Night Soil King" of this city, contracted to transport garbage to Yangjiatang near the Longhua Cement Factory along the Huangpu River in South Shanghai, a place commonly known as the garbage wharf. He built several thatched huts there as an office, and hired two accountants, one of whom was Japanese. They were transported daily by the company's boat, leaving early and returning late, a routine they were accustomed to. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, due to a boat schedule disruption, they were unable to return to Shanghai. They stayed there overnight and were discovered by Shen Shuliang, a local bandit from Shenjiazhai nearby. That night, Shen Shuliang gathered a group and abducted both of the accountants,

hiding them in the home of a Mr. someone in Shenjiazhai, south of Changqiao Town. He then sent a letter to Ma Hongji, demanding 100,000 yuan for their release. Later, Cai Nanqing, the foreman of the office, entrusted Shan Quanlin and others to negotiate with the bandits. As a result, Ma Hongji paid over 1,000 yuan to ransom the two accountants. Jiang Fengtao, a Danyang native who ran a noodle shop in Longhua and was a fake detective for the Nanshi Gendarmerie, learned of the incident. He reported it to the Japanese military police, who, along with puppet police, went and arrested Shen Shuliang, the mastermind. Shen Shuliang confessed that

many of his accomplices were hiding in Changqiao and Huajing. Yesterday morning, Mori San, the head of the propaganda unit in Beiqiao, led Japanese and puppet troops to Changqiao Town and arrested twelve innocent civilians, including Pan Aliuliu. They then went to Huajing Town and arrested fifteen villagers, including Zhang Qiusheng and Li Xiaogou. As they passed through Tangwan, the villagers, having been forewarned, all fled. The twenty-seven arrested individuals are now being held in the Japanese military propaganda unit jail in Beiqiao Town.

There is also the line from Bainangben (Jin Tower City) to Magubalai, which is not connected to the above two lines, but is also an important transportation route in southern Vietnam. In today's situation where domestic transportation urgently needs to connect with foreign countries, the Vietnam National Railway does indeed occupy an important position. We have obtained the prices of passenger tickets, sleeper berths, and meals, which are detailed below for the reference of readers:

### Transportation Briefs

Jawa Company Now Collects Foreign Currency The Jawa Company's postal ships operating between Shanghai and Xiamen originally calculated fares in national currency. Due to the soaring foreign exchange rates, the company has suffered considerable losses. Therefore, starting with the Zhishaluya on the 21st of this month, departing from Shanghai to Xiamen and Hong Kong, all passenger tickets to Xiamen and Hong Kong will be collected in foreign currency. The fares are as follows:

From Shanghai to Xiamen: First class 5 British pounds, second class 2 pounds and 5 shillings, third class 1 pound and 15 shillings, fourth class 1 pound.

Italian Postal Ships Stop Selling Round-Trip Tickets The Italian Postal Ship Company has stopped selling all two-month round-trip tickets from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Xiaoluzong, and from Hong Kong to Xiaoluzong, starting from May 25th. Therefore, passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong can no longer enjoy the company's two-month round-trip ticket优惠。(The return ticket price for the originally scheduled two-month round-trip ticket was only one-third or half of the one-way ticket price.) Six-month round-trip tickets can still be sold, but the return ticket price is only 80% of the one-way ticket price.

Taigu Yihui Increases Prices Due to the recent increase in foreign exchange rates, the above company will also implement price increases from the 21st of this month. The increase rate will be about 10% of the originally scheduled ticket price. The newly set ticket prices are briefly described below:

Shanghai to Hong Kong: Official cabin 60 yuan in national currency, room cabin 42 yuan, bunk 31 yuan, general cabin 24 yuan.

Shanghai to Haiphong: Official cabin 112 yuan in national currency, room cabin 82 yuan, bunk 54 yuan, general cabin 44 yuan (including head tax).

Detailed ticket prices can be inquired from the company and various travel agencies. Passengers who book and pay a deposit before the 21st can enjoy the originally scheduled ticket prices.

French Airlines Increase Prices The Hong Kong-Hanoi section of the company's air ticket prices has been changed from June 1st of this year to 14 British pounds for a one-way ticket from Hong Kong to Hanoi, 25 pounds for a round trip, and 1 shilling and 5 pence per kilogram of excess baggage.

The ticket prices for other stations in the Far East of the company will remain the same.

### Williams Overland New Cars Arrive in Shanghai

### Journey to Guangxi (Continued from Last Issue)

— Kechang

After obtaining the passport, pay a visa fee of one yuan at the French Consulate on the top floor of Alexandra House on Des Voeux Road and apply for an endorsement. Once endorsed, it becomes effective. This type of passport can only stay in Haiphong for fourteen days. If you need to stay longer, a local reputable business must apply for an extension from the police station on your behalf. Otherwise, you will be severely punished. Upon arriving in Haiphong, first take a train to Hanoi, a distance of 102 kilometers, which can be reached in two hours. The ticket price is 2.13 Vietnamese dollars for second class and 1.25 Vietnamese dollars for third class. From Hanoi, transfer to the northern section of the Vietnam National Railway to the Vietnamese border town of Dongdeng, a distance of 167 kilometers, which can be reached in 50 hours. The ticket price is 9.78 Vietnamese dollars for first class, 6.52 Vietnamese dollars for second class, 2.70 Vietnamese dollars for third class, and 1.13 Vietnamese dollars for fourth class, all in Vietnamese currency. In the eyes of ordinary people, to go to Longzhou, one should naturally get off at Dongdeng. However, Liangshan has better hotels and restaurants for accommodation. Dongdeng is just a border town, and accommodation is not easy to find at all. Secondly, the Longliang bus starts from Liangshan, and changing to a bus in Liangshan is also more convenient than in Dongdeng. Therefore, it is still more convenient to get off in Liangshan first. The ticket price from Hanoi to Liangshan is 8.88 Vietnamese dollars for first class, 5.92 Vietnamese dollars for second class, 2.44 Vietnamese dollars for third class, and 1.02 Vietnamese dollars for fourth class, all in Vietnamese currency. From Liangshan to Longzhou in Guangxi, it is 73 kilometers, passing through Dongdeng, Zhennanguan, Aikou, Pingxiang, Nakan, and Yazitan. The bus leaves Liangshan at 2:00 PM (Vietnam time), which is one hour behind domestic time, and arrives in Longzhou at 7:00 PM (domestic time). The ticket price is 6.64 Guangxi currency (every 2 Guangxi currency equals 1 national currency). Free baggage is limited to 20 kilograms per person, and overweight baggage is charged 0.788 Guangxi currency per 10 kilograms. Upon arriving in Longzhou, you can take the Guangxi Highway Bureau's long-distance bus to Nanning. From Nanning, the highway can lead to Guilin via Liuzhou, or to Guiyang via Datang. The Guangxi Provincial Highway Bureau's buses depart from Longzhou and Nanning every day, one from Longzhou at 5:00 AM, and arrives in Nanning around 4:00 PM. The ticket price is 11.21 national currency per person. Free baggage is also limited to 20 kilograms, and overweight baggage is charged 1 yuan in national currency per 10 kilograms. In addition, there is also a direct highway from Haiphong to Longzhou, which can be reached by hiring a small chartered car. The entire journey from Haiphong to Longzhou can be completed in six or seven hours by a small chartered car. If you depart from Haiphong at 8:00 AM, rest for lunch in Liangshan, and depart from Liangshan again at 2:00 PM, you can arrive in Longzhou by 5:00 PM. However, a small chartered car costs about 90 Vietnamese dollars.

According to what has been said above, going to Guangxi now cannot be considered inconvenient, but there are a few things to pay attention to: When entering Haiphong, the passport should be sent to the French Police Department for endorsement and the route of departure must be declared, as the route must match when leaving the country. If the route changes, the police station must re-endorse it. Items such as silk, satin, wool, cloth, clothing, embroidery, cosmetics, and all other newly purchased items that are likely to be taxed may be removed as much as possible, grouped together, and pointed out to customs officers upon arrival to await their determination of whether to tax them. In this way, you can avoid penalties and hope that the inspection of the remaining luggage will be simplified. Do not secretly wrap them in bedding or other places, hoping to smuggle them through, because once they are discovered, not only will the luggage be detained, but also severely punished. When buying a long-distance bus ticket in Liangshan, be sure to show your passport to the station staff for inspection, otherwise you will need a certificate from the head of the village. When the bus arrives in Dongdeng, get off the bus to complete the exit procedures for passport endorsement. Crossing Zhennanguan is Guangxi Province. The Zhennanguan Branch of the Guangxi Anti-Smuggling Bureau will check passports. After another four kilometers to Aikou Town, the Longzhou Customs Branch will check luggage. Upon arriving in Longzhou, you must also go to the Anti-Smuggling Bureau to endorse the passport before entering the city. These procedures must be noted and not forgotten. (End)

### Travel Q&A

Mr. Weng Yuxiang asks about the situation of going to Fujian:

Answer: There were originally ships from the Yihui Company and other Portuguese merchants sailing from Shanghai to Fuzhou, with ticket prices of 30 yuan for official cabins, 20 yuan for room cabins, and 11 yuan for general cabins. Recently, the ships of various companies have all been suspended. Occasionally, there are ships sailing, but there are very few scheduled trips. Therefore, those going to Fujian may take the route through Wenzhou, passing through Qingtian, Lishui, and Longquan, and entering Fujian Province at Pucheng, then taking the Fujian Provincial Highway to Fuzhou. However, anyone going to Wenzhou must hold a local shop guarantee. Letters to Fujian are also transferred through Zhejiang Province, which can take more than ten days to reach.

Mr. Zhang Luo asks about going to Dageng County, Jiangxi

Route:

Answer: If you want to take the route to Shantou to Dageng, Jiangxi, you can refer to the eleventh issue of this magazine. After arriving in Qujiang, you can follow the highway to Dageng, and the bus fare is more than ten yuan. It is inconvenient to carry maps when traveling in the interior. As for a small number of textbooks, there is no problem. Smallpox vaccination, immunization, and identification are all required. The identification should be issued by the agency or school where the person works or studies to be valid.

Mr. Yang Zhendong asks about flights between Hong Kong and Kunming

and ships between Hong Kong and Fangcheng.。

Answer: There are no direct flights between Hong Kong and Kunming. First, take a French or Imperial Airways flight from Hong Kong to Hanoi, Vietnam. The ticket price is 14 British pounds. From Hanoi, transfer to a Eurasia or China National Aviation Corporation flight to Yunnan. The ticket price is 95 Vietnamese dollars and 90 yuan. Free baggage is only 5 kilograms and is subject to inspection. Those who take the route through Vietnam to Yunnan must have a passport before they are allowed to purchase a ticket. To go from Hong Kong to Fangcheng, you can take the French Far East Shipping Company's Xiaoguangdong ship, which departs from Hong Kong on the 10th, 20th, and 30th of each month. The third-class ticket price is 33 Vietnamese dollars, and the fourth-class ticket price is 12 Hong Kong dollars. It takes two days to reach. When arriving in Fangcheng, there is no need to pay tax on the newly made Chinese clothing and children's clothing you bring.

Shanghai Special

### Shanghai Travel Business (Continued) (End)  Zhou Sizhong

The United States: The travel business is extremely developed in the United States. This is because the country is prosperous, and the people lead stable lives, so they are very interested in travel. The money spent by Americans traveling to various countries each year is actually greater than the amount spent by people from other countries traveling to America. In the United States, the travel business is a form of trade surplus for the country, but globally, it is indeed the only country that regulates the world economy. One of its travel agencies is American Express Co., which is also a private company, and its organization and business are roughly similar to those of Thomas Cook in the United Kingdom. Another is the National Park Service, which is funded and operated by the railway sector. Every urban business association has an Information Bureau established specifically to facilitate foreign tourists and solicit this kind of intangible export business.

France: France attaches great importance to the travel business and spends a huge sum of 1.2 million US dollars annually specifically for overseas promotion expenses. Recently, a Secretary of State has been added within the government to specifically handle this matter, in order to promote and develop it. According to official French statistics, in 1937, there were 90 million tourists from various countries visiting France, and the money they spent in France reached 6 billion francs. The power of its publicity is imaginable. As for its travel agencies: one is the Tourism Bureau, which is operated with funds from the government and the Ministry of Transportation; the other is the Travel Alliance, which is organized by local agencies and specializes in research on the travel business.

Germany: Germany's travel agency is funded and operated by the government, railway banks, shipping companies, and others. Its business includes selling train and boat tickets, transporting luggage, and exchanging foreign currency. It sends 2.5 million copies of printed materials to foreign countries each year, which shows that it spares no effort in promoting the travel business. In addition, those who travel to Germany are exempt from passport visa fees, minor landing taxes, and other special taxes, so the total number of tourists to Germany each year can exceed 1.3 million. The 1936 World Olympic Games were held in Berlin, and tourists from various countries reached more than 1.62 million; however, the total number of tourists to Germany in the following year (1937) increased to 1.89 million, which was not less than the number of people during the World Olympic Games. This shows that the development of the travel business in Germany is truly amazing.

Switzerland: Since Switzerland does not produce much and its industrial and commercial enterprises are not as large as those of major countries, what does its government rely on for funding? The travel business has therefore become extremely important to the government. Switzerland is the most beautiful country in Europe, and the number of people from various countries visiting Switzerland is increasing every year. The Swiss government's funding largely depends on this, so it strives to provide convenience for foreign tourists. All travelers to Switzerland are given special convenience, such as not requiring passport visas and offering special prices for railways. All preferential measures that can facilitate travelers are implemented to the best of its ability. The travel agency is the National Tourism Bureau, which is funded and operated by the government and various cities. It strives exceptionally hard to attract foreign guests. According to non-official reports, the number of tourists to Switzerland can reach 3.5 million per year.

Other countries, such as Canada, the Soviet Union, Italy, Sweden, Turkey, Poland, Greece, the Netherlands, Mexico, and New Zealand, all have travel agencies established, and their purpose of promoting travel is also the same, except that their scale is different.

China's Travel Business is Still Undeveloped In contrast, in our country, neither the government nor the people pay much attention to the travel business, and they cannot find ways to attract foreign tourists. The government authorities do not attach importance to this industry or provide much assistance. In addition, national construction has been awaiting progress in recent years, so assistance and promotion of the travel business is beyond its capabilities. According to a reliable survey in 1931, the total amount spent by American tourists in various countries was more than 50.275 million yuan, while China only received more than 6 million yuan, which is the smallest amount among all countries. This proves that it cannot pay attention to overseas publicity work. Otherwise, with our country's beautiful mountains and rivers, abundant products, and gradual progress in industry and commerce, what could attract foreign tourists would be more than this number.

Shanghai's Travel Business However, Shanghai is the most prosperous commercial port in China, and it also has concessions, so its situation is different from other parts of the country, and its travel business is also more developed than other places. However, the establishment of travel agencies in Shanghai was not only not initiated by the Chinese government, but also not operated by Chinese nationals. Although the author has worked in travel agencies for more than seven years, I have always felt regretful when I think of this. Currently, the travel business in Shanghai has developed to a considerable extent, and before the war, this business had an extremely prosperous trend. Although there are many travel agencies, only a few are well-organized and known to both Chinese and foreigners. The more famous ones are Thomas Cook & Son, American Express Company, Japan Tourist Bureau, and China Travel Service, the only Chinese travel agency where the author currently works. The following is a description of the business situation of each of the above companies in Shanghai.

Shanghai's Travel Agencies Thomas Cook & Son is the originator of the travel industry. Its invention was as early as 97 years ago, as I have mentioned in the first chapter. It has a total of more than 360 branches worldwide. It came to the Far East around 1913, and the Shanghai office is the headquarters of its Far East branch. It was also one of the earliest companies to come to Shanghai. It is currently located at the corner of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road. Its business purpose is mainly to sell train, boat, and plane tickets; it also acts as an agent for international passenger car berths, transports luggage, and handles transportation matters. It also issues travel checks in gold pounds and US dollars and operates foreign exchange. Before the establishment of China Travel Service, it was the most perfect travel agency in Shanghai. Recently, its business has been greatly affected by the war.

Japan Tourist Bureau This agency was originally a commercial enterprise. Later, the Japanese government, recognizing the importance of the travel business and its benefits to the national economy, invested in and assisted in transforming it into a travel agency jointly run by the government and private sector. It has a history of 26 years and is dedicated to promoting international understanding and goodwill and attracting foreign tourists to Japan as its sole mission. Almost every country has a branch of this bureau. In major cities and commercial ports in China, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Beijing, Shenyang, etc., there are branch offices. The Japan Tourist Bureau in Shanghai has been established for 15 years. Its business policy is mainly to promote Japanese scenic spots and attract tourists to Japan. Before the war, the number of tourist groups to Japan attracted by the bureau each year was extremely large, and its income was very abundant. Since the outbreak of the war, its business has felt very desolate.

American Express Co. This is an American travel agency. Its headquarters is on Broadway in New York, and it has branches in many countries. The Far East headquarters is in Hong Kong, and it has a 20-year history in Shanghai. Its business situation also contains banking characteristics, so it is divided into two departments: the banking department and the travel department. The banking department specializes in foreign exchange and travel checks; the travel department mainly undertakes tours. Most of the company's tourists are Americans. It also used to sell train and plane tickets and transport luggage. After the war, the number of tourists decreased, and it only uses boat tickets as its main business. Its business has been greatly affected.

In addition, there are also World Travel Service Travel Advisers, which are travel agencies run by Westerners. They also have a considerable history in Shanghai, but their business is not very developed. Also, at the beginning of the war, International Guide Burean emerged in response to the situation, and its business was naturally very developed, but it was ultimately a speculative business and its foundation was not solid, so it was only a flash in the pan.

China Travel Service China Travel Service is a travel agency run by Chinese people. It was established in 1923, and 16 years have passed since then. Examining its history, it is not very long, but describing the course of its business and the motives for its establishment, there is something to be said: Since the European War, the travel business in Europe and the United States has made rapid progress, and the development situation has been discussed earlier. The travel agencies of foreigners in China have also become increasingly developed. Chinese people who travel abroad also gradually rely on foreigners for boats, vehicles, and luggage. People with lofty ideals are worried about this. The founder of this agency was Mr. Chen Guangfu. However, some people may not know what Mr. Chen's motives were for founding a travel agency. Before reporting on the organization of the travel agency itself, I would like to start with this matter, which I think readers will also be happy to hear. Mr. Chen Guangfu is a travel enthusiast. Thirty years ago, he personally visited various places in China and abroad, and his knowledge was broad, and he benefited greatly from travel. However, at that time, there was no travel agency established in China. If he wanted to travel abroad, he had to consult a travel agency run by foreigners. I often think that those who can create great undertakings must have greater intelligence than ordinary people, but the motives for their great undertakings may be in extremely small places, and they can stimulate their great intelligence to create great undertakings. Observing Mr. Chen's founding of a travel agency, I believe even more that Mr. Chen's founding of a travel agency was not based on empty assumptions, nor was it a fleeting idea. The story is as follows: One day, Mr. Chen wanted to travel again, so he went to a Western company to discuss the itinerary. Unexpectedly, after Mr. Chen expressed his intentions to the Western staff member of the company, the staff member talked intimately with a Western woman and did not entertain the customer, as if it was not important. Mr. Chen did not use his anger at this. After returning, countless thoughts gathered in his mind: "Why should there be a travel agency run by foreigners in China's own territory? Why can't Chinese people solve their own travel problems? I am Chinese and want to travel around my own land, so why should foreigners guide me? When foreigners come to China, why don't Chinese people have travel agencies to guide and entertain them? Are Chinese people unable to run travel agencies?" And so on. These questions repeatedly asked himself, and all these kinds of things swirled in his mind and did not immediately dissipate. After Mr. Chen thought again and again, he made the greatest determination and created this only China Travel Service run by Chinese people. After the agency was established, it adhered to Mr. Chen's principle of serving society and engaged in travel matters. At that time, when the Chinese people saw this emerging industry, they all expressed their joy. Those who had contact with foreigners all returned to this agency. Over time, its reputation was established, and even foreign travelers sought only this agency. After more than ten years of hard work by colleagues, it has the foundation it has today. Before the war, all important commercial ports and cities in China had staff serving the agency, because they could contact each other, and travelers felt that it was convenient. Since the outbreak of the war, although the ports that have fallen into war zones have withdrawn one after another, the emerging businesses in the southwest and northwest have increased even more, and everything that can benefit the travel community and the country is done to the best of its ability. As for Shanghai, there is a branch on Sichuan Road; however, fearing that the service is not comprehensive, five branch offices have been established on Yuyuan Road, Baxianqiao, Tongfu Road, Xiafei Road, and in Wing On Company, specifically to facilitate residents in various districts. The company's business:

1. Selling Passenger Tickets All domestic and foreign train, boat, plane, and road passenger tickets are sold at the set price, and no handling fees are charged.

2. Applying for Passports Travelers who travel far feel that applying for passports is difficult. Sometimes they do not understand the procedures, or they may make mistakes in their schedules. In view of this, the agency specially collects passports for customers, strives to simplify the procedures, and strives for speed. Although it is more difficult now, it will still do its best to help travelers.

3. Transporting Luggage Travelers consider luggage to be the most difficult thing. The agency has trucks to transport luggage for customers. Whether it is from the port to the residence, or from the residence to the port, everything can be picked up and delivered.

4. Handling Freight The agency believes that customs declaration is the most complicated procedure for cargo transportation. Although there are many customs declaration businesses at sea, they are all unwilling to make the procedures public and keep special secrets. The agency has specially set up a freight department to handle cargo transportation and customs declaration matters for all sectors of society.

5. Hotels and Hostels in Various Places The agency believes that the facilities of hotels in large cities are very perfect, but it is extremely difficult to find food and accommodation in the interior, so the agency has established hostels in various places one after another. One is located at the hub of transportation, such as Nanjing, Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Beijing, Xi'an, Nanchang, etc.; the other is located in scenic areas, such as Huangshan, Xuebaoshan, Jinhua, Huashan, Hengshan, etc. Strict attention is paid to cleanliness, hygiene, and attentive service. Since the outbreak of the war, the southwest and northwest have become gathering places for Chinese people. Because development has not been long, the transportation network has not yet been completed, and the standard of living is still very difficult. Therefore, a year ago, on the main transportation routes in the southwest and northwest, it can be said with certainty that there was no better travel agency or food station to find for food and accommodation. After a year of hard work, the agency has established hostels along the transportation routes in the southwest and northwest, and has opened branch offices in more important places, all of which are doing their best to facilitate travelers. If we go to the southwest and northwest to travel, we should know that today's southwest and northwest are no longer the southwest and northwest of the past, and today's travel agency is no longer the travel agency of the past.

6. Travel Books and Newspapers The Travel Magazine has been published for 13 years and is mainly dedicated to promoting Chinese scenic spots, advocating travel, and developing the transportation industry. It is published once a month, and it also compiles and prints travel guides, which detail the prices and schedules of trains, boats, planes, and cars across the country, as well as luggage costs, for travelers to refer to. In addition, it also prints special guide books for various places and illustrated books on the general situation of transportation in various places at any time. Everything that can guide travelers to travel conveniently is completed without hesitation in terms of financial and material resources.

7. Guiding Tours Whether a group or an individual travels to various places in China (or even to Europe and the United States), if they do not understand the various situations, the agency can plan and guide the tour for them. Detailed answers are provided for boat, car, food, and accommodation expenses, and various tours and travels are held in various places at any time, welcoming people from all walks of life to join. Therefore, the agency can be called a seller of mountains, rivers, and scenic spots.

8. Travel Checks Carrying travel expenses in boats and cars is extremely inconvenient. The agency purchases travel checks from the Shanghai Bank for customers. They are commonly used in all major cities and are extremely safe and easy to use.

Conclusion Overall, if we look at the current situation of the travel business in Shanghai, we cannot expect its development, but the future is bright and promising. There is much to be done in the future. Today's prosperity and decline is a precursor to the future's decline and prosperity. Moreover, the travel business does not rely on the prosperity of the market, nor does it determine the increase or decrease in business according to the governance or chaos of national affairs. When other industries are prosperous, the travel business can develop to the best of its ability and will never end. However, often when various industries are depressed and the market is simplified, the travel business can have a tortuous progress. In short, those who are in charge of the matter must be able to use their brains to serve travelers wholeheartedly and seek welfare for the public.

### (4) Inner Treasures

A certain gentleman toiled all his life, always wanting to get rich. After he died, his house was mortgaged to others, but someone discovered that there were hidden treasures in the walls of the house. Unfortunately, this gentleman spent his whole life running around, but he did not discover the infinite wealth that was hidden in his own house! Today, many people are rushing about, seeking nothing more than external things, but they do not know their own inner treasures! Reader, have you discovered that what is hidden in you is a soul endowed by God, with God's character and God's holiness? We must not be short-sighted, but be in the arena of fame and fortune, blinded by material desires, so that the inner treasures are forever buried in sin and transgression! Human organization has spirit, soul, and body. The body is the tool of the soul and spirit, the soul is the organ of communication with oneself, and has the sense to know how to protect its own interests. The spirit is the organ of communication with God, and can distinguish right from wrong and know how to glorify God and benefit people. Today, if people can let God dominate the soul and the body, they can restore the status of the original person. Therefore, I hope that my dear readers will discover the precious spirituality in themselves, and rely on God's great love for us. When we are dead in sin and transgression, only believing in God can bring us back to life with Christ Jesus, because we are saved by grace and by faith. ——Shanghai Christian Literature Outreach Association Post Office Box 1227.

### Current Situation of the China Merchants Bureau

The China Merchants Steamship Bureau has now rented the old base of Yisheng Foreign Firm, and is repairing it. It will be completed in half a month and can be moved into. It is found that this bureau has been very prosperous recently, which is very different from the time when it was first established. Many Shanghai silver masters want to join the shares. However, the bureau's capital is already sufficient, totaling one million taels of silver, divided into one hundred shares. The ship was sent to Nagasaki and Kobe the other day, and it is planned to travel between Shanghai and Japan on a regular basis. The ship is named Yidun, but it costs more coal. Fortunately, the price of coal in Nagasaki is very cheap, and it is also very convenient to handle it along the way.

### Yin Gang Night Market

Ten miles southwest of Wusong, there is a place called Yingang, with dozens of households, which is not deserted; and its transactions are all at night. During the day, every household is closed, and even tea houses and wine markets are deserted, with no one there, and the doors are half-open and closed. When the lights are turned on, everything is done, and everything from firewood, rice, oil, and salt to all kinds of crafts is opened for business. The stalls for picking melons and selling vegetables each have a lamp, which is used to weigh things and count money. Villagers who trade silk and cloth also come in droves, and they go home with wine and meat after finishing their goods, and it is past midnight. Although officials have repeatedly banned it, it cannot be changed. The money sold last night was suddenly found to be mostly paper ashes. In the future, it is planned to set up a water basin for each stall to put money in to verify its authenticity. However, it is ultimately impossible to change the normal practice of trading during the day.

### County Magistrate Sacrifices Himself for Rain

A certain county under the jurisdiction of Zhenjiang Prefecture was suffering from a severe drought. Repeated prayers were ineffective. The county magistrate carried the statue of the City God to the hot sun, accusing him of his duty to protect the land. He also wore his official uniform and was exposed to the sun with the statue from morning to night, without eating a grain of rice. However, the City God's clay statue was still intact; and the county magistrate's flesh body could not eat the new grain, because he died of heat stroke after being exposed to the sun for seven days. This official can truly be said to have worked diligently to the point of death.

### The First International Refugee Camp Affiliated Radio Training Class

— Wen Xia

The training period is six months, and there is no problem with the way out.

The recently publicly performed results were not bad.

Hardoon Garden Will Open

The sustenance of Shanghai refugees has always been a problem. Many people in charge of refugee camps are worried about the future funding of the refugees. Recently, I heard that someone is contacting the owner of Hardoon Garden, hoping to open a resolution. After the opening, the tickets can earn at least 100,000 yuan, and the refugee expenses for two months in the summer can be

It is said that Mrs. Hardoon has not yet agreed. For the sake of the food and support of hundreds of thousands of refugees, Mrs. Hardoon, who is good at doing good deeds, does not seem to have to insist any longer. If this plan can be realized, it would be a really good thing.

Hardoon Garden was opened once or twenty years ago (it is said that the scenery inside is excellent). Now, if it is opened again, it is indeed a rare grand event!

The above news can only be regarded as an incidental report.

Yesterday, in order to visit the radio training class for orphans affiliated to the First International Refugee Camp on Masnan Road, I also received an unfortunate message, that is, this refugee camp has been ordered by the General Assembly, and is now evacuating refugees, so that those with hometowns and occupations will slowly leave the refugee camp, and want to end the refugee camp in the near future.

Although we cannot say that refugees must rely on refugee camps forever, the financial difficulties of the relief society are evident here. The address of the First International Refugee Camp was originally the exchange field of Aurora University. Aurora has urged several times to take it back for its own use. It seems that the First Refugee Camp will have to end soon.

When I went yesterday, I saw packages and scattered objects piled up in front of the reed shed door of the refugee camp. Presumably these are the belongings of the refugees who are leaving.

I had a half-hour talk with Mr. Pan, the director of the camp, and Mr. Li Fucheng, the director of the education group. They led me to visit the classroom of the radio class. It was already noon, and the 16- or 17-year-old male and female refugee children were eating their most meager lunch at the desks in their classroom.

On the 11th, this radio class invited the managers of several radio companies in Shanghai, such as Mr. Li Weishou and Mr. Yang Shufen, as judges to hold a radio communication performance.

The method of performance was to use an English manuscript, which was sent by the professor using radio code, and the male and female students received it on the spot; the second step was for the students to send and receive it themselves.

It is said that the performance that day was not bad.

Mr. Li Fucheng said: The students in this training class were originally recommended by the three refugee camps of the International Refugee Camp, and many people were also recommended by other refugee camps.

When it first started, there were 50 or 60 people. Later, those with insensitive vision and hearing were removed, and now the total number of students in the class is 34. There are six or seven girls.

The training steps are divided into two types: first, the primary training class, which focuses on receiving and sending reports; the second is the advanced training class, which focuses on the repair and installation of transceivers. The training time is six months.

According to the current allocation of time and curriculum, six months is of course quite short. If the students can work hard, they can of course cope.

According to Director Pan, the way out can be completely no problem after six months of training, because various places are in great need of this talent.

The coaches are Mr. Zhang Heqing and Mr. Wang Shuling. They are completely obligated and do not receive salaries. This spirit is very admirable.

On the production side of the center, we are also planning to manufacture red and blue ink. After many trials, this plan has been approved by the General Office, and large products will be manufactured soon.

It is said that the difficulties in this first refugee camp are that every person is a productive worker. Some have jobs outside, and some work in the camp. It is indeed very difficult for a refugee camp to do this.

Incidentally, I also visited the nursery set up in the center for the refugees. When I visited, there were a dozen children, six or seven years old, sitting at a short rectangular table eating. They were all fat and chubby. One of them stood up and bowed to me. I smiled and nodded to him. He immediately turned to his partner and said:

"He nodded to me!"

Mr. Pan and Mr. Ji and I all laughed.

The innocence of the children is so cute in these places.

### "The Outlaw" Impressions

— Qi Hua

"Jesse James"

A 20th Century Fox production, showing at the Grand Theater.

The much-touted "The Outlaw" finally premiered at the Grand Theater without raising ticket prices. The cast is impressive: Tyrone Power, Nancy Kelly, Henry Fonda, etc.; the director is King Henry; and it's a color film. However, comparing "The Outlaw" to "Robin Hood" seems inappropriate. First, "Robin Hood" relies on the strength of the masses to defeat the enemy, while "The Outlaw" depends solely on the individual bravery of Frank and Jesse. They roam the American West, leading to Jesse's eventual betrayal by his fellow gang member Ford. Second, Errol Flynn's Robin Hood and Tyrone Power's Jesse are different; this difference is probably determined by physique. In several scenes, Tyrone Power's Jesse does indeed shed his past image as a romantic lead, but compared to Errol Flynn, he lacks his heroic and agile demeanor.

Perhaps because of this, director King Henry doesn't focus on Jesse's actions. These only occupy a small number of scenes: robbing a train, breaking out of jail, robbing a bank. However, his small, exquisite details are handled very vividly and dynamically, such as Frank and Jesse fighting Brazil, Frank's arrangements before the jailbreak, and the portrayal of Chill's uncle, Luo Fushi. These details make many dull scenes come alive.

Conversely, King Henry dedicates almost all his energy to the love between Jesse and Chill. After McCook pretends not to pursue Jesse's past and only imposes a five-year prison sentence, Chill gently advises Jesse to abandon evil and return to the right path. Chill and Jesse get married in a church. After the jailbreak, they hide in the mountains. After Chill gives birth, she resolutely lives with her chivalrous uncle for the sake of her future. Finally, Jesse is betrayed by Ford for personal gain, is injured during a bank robbery, and the two scenes before he is about to go to California are particularly emphasized, making the separation and death of this couple as tender and poignant as possible.

Nancy Kelly's Chill delivers a very profound and moving performance in the aforementioned scenes.

However, I prefer the first half of the movie. It makes people realize that we must eliminate these gangsters to live and work in peace, and that all sweet words are poisonous. We, in "this time, this place," should be vigilant. Even the visual weaving of the first half of the movie is tight and powerful.

Henry Fonda has too few scenes.

As for the color, one scene is particularly lovely: Jesse jumps onto a train, the train is speeding, Jesse is crawling on the roof, above is the azure sky, below the windows reflect the faces under the electric lights, and the carriage is a reddish-brown color. In these three different layers of color, it is not only pleasing to the eye but also demonstrates the special effectiveness of color film.

### How to Define "Qi Yun Sheng Dong" (Spiritual Rhythm and Living Movement) in Painting

— Fo

Traditional Chinese painting is one of the arts, and also one of the national treasures. To love art is inherent in human nature, so to study art is originally a very interesting thing. But whether it is Chinese painting or Western painting, the most important condition is "qi yun" (spiritual rhythm). I don't understand Western painting, so let's talk about Chinese painting.

In the past, Xie He said that there are six principles in painting: first, "qi yun," second, "gu fa" (bone method), third, "ying wu xiang xing" (correspond to objects and depict their forms), fourth, "sui lei fu cai" (apply colors according to type), fifth, "jing ying wei zhi" (manage the position), and sixth, "chuan mo yi xie" (copy and transfer). Among the six principles, "qi yun sheng dong" (spiritual rhythm and living movement) is the first. In fact, how can the two words "qi yun" be a principle? The so-called principle must have rules and laws to follow, and must have standards and signs to adhere to. But "qi yun" is an empty and ethereal thing, which can be understood intuitively but cannot be conveyed in words. So why did the ancients put the two words "qi yun" at the head of the six principles?

From beginning to end, "qi yun" is the most important, and has always been so. A painting without "qi yun" is like a person without a soul. A person without a soul is a walking corpse, not a person. A painting without "qi yun" is just carving and piling, how can it be called a painting? The ancients said that calligraphy and painting come from the same source, so those who are good at calligraphy must be good at painting, and those who are good at painting must be good at calligraphy. But everyone can write characters, and how many people in ancient and modern times can be called good at calligraphy? There are countless painters in ancient and modern times, but how many of their paintings are enough to be passed down through the ages?

The ancients said that the diseases of painters are all related to the use of the brush, namely three: one is stiffness, two is sharpness, and three is knotting. If you suffer from these three diseases, your painting, no matter how elaborate, is not worth seeing. Wen Zhengming said: "Dropping ink on paper is not a trivial matter. You must have nothing in your mind, and then the mist, clouds, and beautiful scenery, and the life-generating energy of heaven and earth will naturally gather." Dong Qichang said: ""Qi yun" cannot be learned, it is naturally given by heaven, but there are also places to learn it. Read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles, and clear the turbidity in your mind. Naturally, hills and valleys will be in your mind, and everything you write at hand will be a vivid landscape." Deng Chun's painting bridge says: "The appearance is very important. The myriad things that fill the world all contain the mystery of thinking with a brush, and the reason why they can fully express it is only one method. What is that one? It is "chuan shen" (transmit the spirit)." This only knows that people have a spirit, but does not know that things have a spirit. This is why Guo Ruoxu deeply despised the many craftsmen, saying that although they are called paintings, they are not paintings, because they can only transmit their form but cannot transmit their spirit. In one word, painting should be a painting with vitality, not a painting without vitality, and it should be a lively painting, not a rigid painting.

Then it can be known that painting should take "qi yun sheng dong" (spiritual rhythm and living movement) as the first principle. But what is "qi yun," and what is "sheng dong"? Although the ancients had these words, they never explained them, and could not explain them. The so-called "qi yun sheng dong" can only be understood intuitively and cannot be expressed in words. The ancients could not convey it in words, so how can I convey it? I will give examples of ancient painters' "chuan shen" (transmit the spirit) to substantiate it, so that those who study painting may have some understanding. (To be continued)

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 12: A Beauty Avenges Her Enemies, But Cannot Erase Her Karma; Love is Discussed in the Green Window, and Good Fortune is Re-established.

After Pan Peiying found these two letters, she could only cry over them, thinking that the person was already dead, so what else could be said? However, she treasured these two suicide notes. She foolishly thought that if she hadn't written that cold and rejecting reply, perhaps he wouldn't have died. "Although I didn't kill Boren, Boren died because of me." At that time, Pan Peiying's father had also died, and her family had scattered and separated. She was free, but she was lonely and desolate, like a goose separated from its flock. Many people thought she was the daughter of Pan Lao Lao, and were unwilling to get close to her. She also seemed to feel ashamed of herself. If people ignored her, she wouldn't bother with them. At this time, she was teaching in a small school, passing these few years. It was two years after China's complete restoration. One day, she returned to Wuxi and accidentally went to Huishan for a walk. At this time, it was in March, a beautiful spring day. Huishan was much more prosperous than before. It was also a Sunday, and there were many tourists. She couldn't help but think of the past when she was in school, and on Sundays, many classmates would often go hiking together. Sometimes she and Zhao Letian would sit here for a while. Time flew by in an instant, and now they were forever separated. She sat in a place, watching many men and women laughing and talking, but she was just staring blankly in a daze. She didn't expect that someone would walk in front of her and gently call out to her: "Sister Peiying, I haven't seen you in a long time, do you still recognize me?" When Peiying looked up, it was an old female classmate, Yuan Shuwen, who had studied in a certain school together and worked together in the student union. Although her complexion was much older now, her facial features were still the same. Pan Peiying quickly stood up and said, "It's Sister Shuwen, how could I not recognize you? Oh my! Have we been separated for seven or eight years?" Yuan Shuwen said, "It's really been many years since we last met. How is Mr. Zhao doing lately? We haven't seen him in a long time either." Pan Peiying was confused when she heard this, and after a daze, she asked, "Which Mr. Zhao?" Yuan Shuwen said, "I'm asking about Mr. Zhao Letian. At that time, we also worked together in the student union. I didn't expect him to give up his pen and join the army later, he was really so brave! I originally wanted to visit you two, but I always procrastinated and didn't get around to it. Today, it's a coincidence that I ran into an old friend here." Pan Peiying was even more confused when she heard her say this. Because she thought that Zhao Letian was already dead, why did she ask me, "How is his health?" And say, "Visit you two," putting me together with him, isn't that Yuan Shuwen seeing a ghost alive? (138)

### The Fates of Hollywood Stars

— Gong Shi

New York's prophet Steve publishes the fates of Hollywood's famous male and female stars every year, which is often miraculously accurate. For example, last year's predictions about Tyrone Power winning the highest honor, and Joan Crawford's third divorce, have come true. Therefore, whenever Steve publishes his annual predictions for movie stars, Hollywood becomes the center of conversation, and the movie stars mentioned, especially those with bad luck, are very nervous, fearing that Steve's words will come true. Steve published his annual predictions for Hollywood stars in early May this year. The following are the most interesting translated notes:

Three Famous Plays on the Screen: After the unprecedented success of Bernard Shaw's famous play "Pygmalion" on the screen, three of Shaw's famous plays will be filmed this year, still by MGM. One of them will star the famous actor Clark Gable.

"The Dictator" Cannot Be Released: Although Chaplin's "The Dictator" has long been announced to be filmed, there is no hope of release this year. It will not be publicly screened in New York until mid-July next year. The female lead in the film will not be Paulette Goddard, because Goddard has divorced Chaplin by then.

### Yan Jupeng Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon

— Mu Yun

After Mao Shilai, the Golden Theater has decided to be taken over by Yan Jupeng, Hou Yulan, Ma Liankun, Wang Fushan, and others. (Arriving in Shanghai on the 25th, performing from the 28th). Hou is a top student from the Peking Opera School. This magazine has previously published a photo of her in "Sacrifice to the River," in which Hou plays Sun Shangxiang, with a graceful and dignified manner and a commendable appearance and voice. In recent years, only Zhang Yizhen has been welcomed by the audience in Shanghai, but she is not from a professional background. Without Hu Tiefen's qin accompaniment, it would be difficult to see her brilliance. Yulan graduated from the Peking Opera School, which is equivalent to graduating as a disciple. Her skills are naturally not weak, and it is rare for female actors to study in a professional school. Yulan and Zhao Jinrong are both outstanding talents in the female roles of the Opera School. It is said that Zhao has already married. This time, Hou's coming south with Jupeng is not only related to her personal future, but also can take this opportunity to contribute the achievements of her alma mater to the ladies of Shanghai. The Shanghai opera audience knows the skills of Ma Liankun and Wang Fushan in detail, so there is no need to repeat them. The Golden authorities also intend to keep Gao Shenglin, Jiang Shiyu, and Qiu Shengrong to play with Jupeng. Shenglin has been in the limelight this time, and has been promoted from the third rank to the second rank. Shengrong is the son of the famous net Qiu Guixian. Although he is slightly small in stature, he takes acting seriously and has a family background. If he co-stars in "Complete Da Bao Guo" with Jupeng Yulan, he will be able to perform happily and win praise. Jupeng has not performed in Shanghai for a long time, and his voice has greatly improved recently. The supporting roles he brings are also very neat. It is expected that this performance will be very successful. (Auction Donation)

### Two Shanghai Opera Troupes Will Go Abroad

— Hai

Since the Chinese Peony Opera Troupe went abroad to perform in Little Luzon and returned with great success, some people in Shanghai are now mobilizing to organize opera troupes to go overseas. As far as I know, there are two troupes in progress. One is organized by Jin Lianxi, who plans to follow in the footsteps of the Peony Troupe to Little Luzon. The import license for the troupe has been obtained by Hua Zhongxia, a female actor martial artist who has married there. If it can become a reality, it will set off next month. The other is Kun Dan Biyu Zhen, who has agreed on terms with the Singapore representative, Mr. Chen, to organize a troupe to go there. She is also actively inviting actors.

### The Person Yu Shuyan Most Respected

— Tian Ci

Speaking of Shuyan, his nature is very strange. He only knows how to do things according to his own temper. Even if celebrities invite him to perform in operas, he often refuses when he "doesn't give face." However, he listens only to the late General Li Zhengwu, the commander of the former Guangfu Army, and dares not show his "master's temper." In fact, his "success" and his rise to fame were all thanks to Li Lao's promotion!

It turns out that before he became famous, his situation was just so-so. Later, his art was discovered by Li Lao, who recommended him to his own student, Zhang Zongchang, the "long-legged general" who dominated one side. Zhang took care of him because of the old gentleman's face. Whenever there were performances at Zhang's mansion, he would be called to go, and he would always get a reward of 18,000, so his life was very comfortable. Therefore, he had to give special respect to Li Lao for "drinking water and thinking of the source."

When Great Wall Record Company was established, the company authorities sent someone to invite him to make a record, but he "rejected it from thousands of miles away." The Wei Cheng company then asked Li Lao for help. Li Lao made a long-distance call to Peking, and he immediately wired back "As you wish," without talking about anything else. This was his way of repaying Li Lao's kindness. And the company's having his records is also thanks to Li Lao. So Li Zhengwu can be said to be the person Yu Shuyan most respected.

### Unofficial History of Paradise

— Xu Muyun

Yaoqing and Liqing's Later Years are Far Inferior to Fengqing's

Wang Cailin's eldest son is named Yaoqing, the next is Fengqing, and Liqing is the youngest. Yaoqing performed with Tan Xinpei, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Satang, and other famous mustachioed actors on the same stage in Tongqing, China Theater, and Fushou Troupe for a long time, so he became famous very early. At that time, Fengqing and Liqing were not famous. Feng Erfang was singing young male roles. (When Yao Xiang and Liu Bo jointly operated the China Theater. Fengqing had already changed to old male roles). Liqing was also learning and acting. In the beginning, the family expenses were mostly borne by Yaoqing. He was originally a loyal and honest person, and he didn't care even if he had to pay a few more dollars each month for these things to support his younger brothers. However, women are narrow-minded after all, and Wang's grandmother is a nosy and talkative person, so bad feelings arose between the sisters-in-law. The Fengqing couple were forced by circumstances, and even though they often heard idle talk, they had to swallow their anger and dare not show any displeasure. Later, Yaoqing suddenly lost his voice, and his voice collapsed (losing his voice in middle age, the term "collapsed voice" is what actors fear most, because it is easier for young people to recover their voice after it collapses, but once it collapses, there is no hope of recovery, and Gao Qingkui has this problem now.). At the same time, Fengqing became very popular after changing to acting in the Pai-style mustachioed role. Compared with the two, it was the opposite of the past. As Lanfang's reputation grew, Fengqing's value naturally increased. Every time Lanfang went to Shanghai and Hankou to perform, the fee would be 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and Fengqing would be able to get a huge sum of 8,000 to 9,000 yuan each time. Moreover, since his eldest son Shaoqing became Lanfang's erhu player, he could also earn two or three thousand yuan a month. Sometimes Mei, Wang, accepting hall performances and Hong Kong film matters, the Fengqing father and son could get extra income, so for many years, Feng Er's private property was almost 100,000 yuan. He is a man of few words and lazy to interact with the outside world. When there is no opera, he stays at home all day long. He and his old wife smoke together. (39)

### The Latest Stage Invites Xun Huisheng and His Son Xun Lingxiang to Come Together

— Yi Yin

—The Second Batch Has Attempts to Connect With Zhao Ruquan—

Dong Yong took over the Latest Stage in the name of Jin Xin Company. The initial plan was to connect with Li Wanchun. Who knew that Li Wanchun had gone to Harbin! This has to change the policy, and to contact Xun Huisheng separately. At present, this matter has been largely settled. Xun Huisheng will bring his son Xun Lingxiang (photo see this magazine on the 9th) to Shanghai to perform at the Latest. In addition, the old team of the Carter Grand Theatre, including Lan Yuechun and Wang Guiwu, will also move to the Latest to perform at that time.

Following Xun Huisheng and Xun Lingxiang, the Latest has the intention to invite Zhao Ruquan's opera troupe. Zhao Ruquan is now in Kunming. Recently, a family newspaper arrived in Shanghai. It is said that the entire team of Zhao's troupe will return to Shanghai in three batches. Zhang Guifen and others are the first batch, Zhao Junyu and others are the second batch, and Zhao Ruquan himself is in the third batch. The Latest has sent a letter to Kunming to inquire about the exact date of return to Shanghai. Whether this matter can be successfully negotiated depends on the results of the consultations after Zhao Ruquan returns to Shanghai.

Dancing World Scenery (27)

### On the Advertising Problem of Dance Halls

Regarding this issue, I think there are several points that should be noted and discussed. I will write them down below for the authorities to consider:

1.  Do dance halls really need to advertise? To study this point, we must first study why we advertise. The answer must be to attract customers. Then, does advertising necessarily bring customers? Conversely, does not advertising necessarily mean no customers? This question is difficult to answer. Some may say that advertising will always bring more customers than not advertising, but this answer seems too vague. What is the principle and what is the basis for this? In my opinion, dance halls do not need to advertise every day, but when there are changes in decoration, dancers, or bands, it is necessary to advertise. The meaning of advertising is to let people know my advantages. As for whether they come or not after knowing, it depends on whether my advantages suit their tastes. However, one thing can be said with certainty: customers knowing my advantages does not guarantee they will come, but not knowing guarantees they will not come. Therefore, we can conclude that advertising is indeed necessary.

2.  The wording of advertisements should be in line with reality: This not only relates to the issue of credibility but also has a significant impact on actual business operations. People will only be fooled once. Even if you cheat them once, they will become suspicious. I remember once wanting to see a movie, and when I looked at its advertisement, it said something like "Come early to reserve your seat, or you will be left standing" (I don't remember the exact words, but that was the general meaning). At that time, it was only five minutes before the movie started. I said that we wouldn't be able to find seats, so it would be better not to go. My friend said that the advertisement was probably just exaggerating, so he dragged me along. By the time we entered, the movie had already started, and we could sit anywhere from the first row to the last. From then on, whenever we saw advertisements for this theater, no matter how wonderful they sounded, we would never believe them.

3.  Choosing which newspapers to advertise in: As the saying goes, "Radishes and greens, each to his own." Each newspaper has its own readers. When dance hall authorities want to publish an advertisement, it is best to first think about the content of the advertisement and which group of people it is most suitable for. Then, think about which newspapers that group of people is likely to read. This way, the advertisement will be more effective. As far as I know, the Shanghai newspapers with the largest circulation are of course the Shen and Xin newspapers. Generally, larger industrial and commercial organizations have both. Smaller shops tend to read Xinwen Bao more often. If it is a respectable family and citizens with purchasing power, they seem to read Shen Bao more. In my relatives' and friends' families, about seven or eight out of ten read Shen Bao, so you can often find them at the Paramount and Ciro's.
