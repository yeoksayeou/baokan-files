Postal and telegraph communications between Qiongshan and Hong Kong have been severed, and cargo transport has also been suspended. Hong Kong merchants have been greatly affected.

London: It is expected that the British government will officially announce its attitude towards the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island in the House of Commons tomorrow. According to well-informed sources, Britain will join forces with France to take action against Japan. The general public believes that because the European situation still requires their attention, the British and French governments may only be able to lodge a formal protest regarding the Hainan Island incident at present. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)

Several French warships are currently patrolling outside the port of Haikou, but there is no action yet. (Express News Agency dispatch, 12th)

Lian County: Relevant parties here received a wireless report from a certain place in Qiongya on the 11th. On the morning of the 10th, more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers landed on Hainan Island at two locations. One unit of Japanese soldiers invaded Chengmai from the Da Chang area of Tianwei Port, 60 miles from Haikou, at 2 AM. Another unit of Japanese warships and armed fishing boats, 22 in total, bombarded Xi Xiuying Fort, 20 miles from Haikou, at 8 AM, and sent troops to land. At the same time, more than a dozen Japanese planes flew low reconnaissance missions over Haikou, Bailian, and Lingao, and dropped dozens of bombs near Bailian to assist in the battle. The [unclear] military commander led his troops to resist bravely. At 3 PM, they retreated to a certain place in the southeast due to numerical inferiority. Chengmai Old City and Haikou fell one after another. The previous rumors that Japan landed on [unclear] Island were actually a misunderstanding of Da Chang. According to those familiar with the situation in Qiongya here, Qiongya Island is vast. It is absolutely impossible for three to several thousand people to occupy the entire island. The current actions of the Japanese side seem to be just a diplomatic test of Britain, the United States, and France. (Dispatch on the 12th)

### Situation in Northern Hunan Turns Tense: Chinese Army Launches Large-Scale Attacks in Multiple Directions; Using Strategy of Attacking and Destroying Piecemeal, Japanese Suffer Heavy Casualties; Fierceness of Battle Unprecedented in Second Stage of War; Japanese Planes Fly Reconnaissance and Bombing Missions Over Xinqiang and Gongxian Areas

(Hong Kong) One regiment each of Japanese infantry and artillery has arrived in Chongyang, Yangxin, and Yueyang. The Japanese army on the frontal line has also increased. The situation in northern Hunan is suddenly tense. (Dispatch, 12th, 10:00 PM)

The Chinese troops in Miluo [unclear] launched large-scale attacks on the Japanese army in the southeast of Yueyang at 3:00 AM on the 12th, in freezing weather. All the Japanese 19th Regiment entrenched at Matang Station and Xinkaitang, and the Japanese 36th Regiment at Xitang Wujiang Bridge and Taolin, engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army. Because the Chinese army took the initiative and used the tactics of attacking and destroying piecemeal, the Japanese army was initially trapped in an isolated situation. Later, because the Japanese army's communications were cut off, they fought like trapped beasts. The Chinese army became more and more courageous and did not easily give up the opportunity to annihilate them, resulting in a fierce hand-to-hand combat, unprecedented in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway during the second stage of the war. By 2:00 PM on the 12th, the battle had subsided slightly. On the evening of the 12th, Chinese troops from all directions became active again and are still engaged in fierce fighting. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, with corpses strewn across the fields. The Chinese army also suffered considerable losses. Also, on the morning of the 12th, the Japanese side sent six naval aircraft to fly reconnaissance and bombing missions over the southeast of Xinqiang, seemingly as a threat to the Chinese army's offensive?

With swift and agile movements, they attacked the key points of the Japanese army. The Japanese were caught off guard and fought back in a panic, resulting in numerous casualties. After annihilating the Japanese army, the Chinese army returned to its original formation after completing its mission. The Japanese army, suffering heavy losses, vented their anger on the Chinese people. The next morning, they conducted a large-scale search in the nearby villages, and any Chinese residents they encountered were brutally murdered. They massacred young farmers in droves to vent their anger. Four Japanese warships are currently docked at Bailu Mountain, and several Japanese warships are docked at Baidie Reef, along with more than 20 speedboats. In addition to occasionally patrolling up and down the river, there are no other actions. (Dispatch on the 12th)

### Japanese Army on the Tongpu Railway Suffers Extremely Heavy Losses

Recently, in order to prevent attacks by the Chinese army, a bunker is built every ten miles along the railway, with an obstacle cable connecting the middle. Each bunker is stationed with a squad of Japanese soldiers. All stations are also equipped with solid fortifications. (Dispatch on the 12th)

On the 28th of last month, two Chinese heroes, Li Zhizhang and Dong Yonglu, were captured by the Japanese army in Yuncheng and forced to work as laborers, transporting ammunition. Li and others, eager to serve their country, secretly conspired with transportation workers Li Wensheng, Song Facai, Song Changcun and others, and launched an uprising that night, setting the ammunition on fire. The Yuncheng garrison soldiers were awakened from their dreams by the sound of artillery, and the order was in chaos. It is estimated that more than 400 boxes of ammunition were destroyed.

### Japanese Army Builds Fortifications and Defends Zaoshi

Positions on Suixian Front Unchanged; Chinese Guerrillas in Central Anhui Extremely Active

After the Japanese army on the Hanyi Highway in Fancheng was defeated by the Chinese army after invading Tianmen, they built fortifications and defended Zaoshi. Although there have been frequent movements recently, they are just bluffing. The positions on the Suixian front remain unchanged. The Japanese army on the Hanma Highway in eastern Hubei is only trapped in strongholds such as Songbu and Shujiaji, and the rest are controlled by Chinese guerrillas. Currently, Chinese guerrillas are extremely active in the Tongcheng, Hefei, Liuan, Huoshan, and Huoqiu areas of central Anhui. There are no traces of the Japanese in Qianshan, Taihu, Sushan, Rusong in western Anhui, and Fuyang and Mengcheng in northern Anhui. (Dispatch on the 12th)

Editorial

### Prospects of the Japanese Army Landing on Hainan Island

This newspaper has already commented on the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island yesterday. Chiang Kai-shek's reply to foreign reporters has also been published in yesterday's newspaper. The meaning and impact of Japan's move have been thoroughly explained. In short, this is not directed at China, but at Britain, France, and the United States, and at the Pacific. If the argument is to cut off the transportation of military supplies, then China does not transport military supplies through Hainan Island. Therefore, what is intended to be cut off is the transportation of Britain, France, and the United States. If the argument is based on military strategy, then the key to Japan's war against China is not on Hainan Island. Therefore, the so-called military strategy is definitely not for the war against China, but for the war against Britain, France, and the United States. A certain American newspaper's observation is wrong to regard this as a decisive measure in the Sino-Japanese War. In fact, this is an initial provocative move against the world. China's comprehensive resistance will not abandon a single island. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek said that the Chinese army and people will do their best to deal with the island and not allow it to be easily occupied. However, China's victory lies in the overall situation and in the final victory. Therefore, what is being contested is not this moment or this island. The landing on this island at this time will absolutely not increase China's sense of threat in the slightest. [unclear] We would like to advise our friendly countries, the disaster is deep, and the enemy has arrived!

We do not want to say more about the meaning and impact of the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island. However, observing the reaction of Europe and the United States to this matter, there are those who are uneasy and silent. It is said that France will make a strong protest, Britain and France will take parallel attitudes, and the United States will wait and see for the time being. It is also said that the content of France's protest is based on the following: First, the Sino-French Agreement of 1897; second, the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907; third, the repeated promises made by the Japanese authorities to France after launching the aggression against China; fourth, the statement made by Mr. Butler, the British Foreign Secretary, in the House of Commons on June 27th last year; fifth, the tacit agreement between France and Japan on not transporting Chinese military supplies through Vietnam. What is questioned and wants Japan to explain is the reason, nature, and duration of the landing on Hainan Island. What is regarded as the key is that if it is a temporary landing, then there is not much relationship. If it is intended to be a long-term occupation, then it must be taken seriously. If France's attitude is like this, how will Britain parallel it? What will the United States wait and see, we have not heard of it yet.

France is protesting, and the content of the protest is as detailed as described above. After the protest, what will happen? And what will Britain and the United States do after France's protest? These are all current problems, and the facts to come will have to provide explanation. For now, let's leave it aside. However, there is something that cannot be forgotten: On December 31st, the United States sent a note to Japan; on January 14th, Britain followed; on January 17th, France followed again. Examining the consistent spirit of the three countries' notes, it lies in accusing Japan of destroying trust and breaking its promises, targeting its destruction of trust and breaking its promises. Therefore, it is not a matter of discussing how to maintain trust and keep promises, but a firm expression that trust cannot be destroyed. Therefore, what the three countries are doing is to correct the facts, not to engage in empty words, because empty words are not credible. A month has passed, and Japan has not replied. This shows the extent of its contempt. Not only that, but it also slapped their faces by replying with the landing on Hainan Island. This is called Japan's ferocity, but is it not the shame of Britain, France, and the United States? Can it be forgotten? But now, they are questioning it with reasons, nature, and duration. I have no way of knowing whether Japan will still ignore it or reply with other actions. Unfortunately, if it is correct, how will those who accuse themselves cope? If not, then speak eloquently. But what is the point of hearing their sophistry and lies again and again? If not, then speak gently and say, "It is a temporary occupation, and after the end of the Sino-Japanese War, they will definitely withdraw." But the words are not dry, and those who brazenly break their promises are the advanced countries of the omnipotent states, such as Mr. Mussolini, the Italian Prime Minister, whom the Japanese military leaders want to emulate. Do the British and French countries not forget Mr. Mo's promises? Will they not wait quietly for the Italian troops in Spain and the Japanese troops in Hainan Island to withdraw at the same time? It is not impossible, but can it be obtained through protests!

Since the temporary cessation of the deterioration of the European situation, although it is said that there are crises everywhere, we still hope that the British and French countries will make good use of the time of diplomacy to save the space of deterioration. Now, as evidenced by the rumor that Germany is again mobilizing troops and plans to take action in the first ten days of next month, and as evidenced by the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, we cannot help but suspect that the omnipotent states are making good use of the time that the British and French are being polite and dreaming of peace to fill the space of their deterioration. We discussed earlier that "Japanese warships are off the coast of Annam, preparing to land in the North Sea of China, echoing the omnipotent states in Europe and peering at Annam" (Editorial on January 30th). Now they have abandoned the North Sea and taken Hainan instead. Do they still say it is against China?

### Soviet Observations on the Japanese Invasion of Hainan Island Incident: England and France Greatly Threatened; When the European Situation Becomes Tense Again, This Crisis Will Surface

French Newspapers Say the Whole Problem Depends on How Long the Occupation Lasts

(Moscow) The Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island was not completely unexpected here. When the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, it showed its intention to expand its military operations to South China, because Japan expected that the democratic countries of Europe would not be able to provide effective resistance. Moreover, the observation here is that the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island has no serious impact on China's position. Japan apparently wants to cut off the connection between Yunnan and Annam and Burma, but Hainan Island has no decisive influence on this matter. On the other hand, French Annam and British sea routes have been greatly threatened as a result. Once the European situation becomes tense again, this crisis can surface. Moreover, Soviet newspapers continue to publish special articles on China's war of resistance. Many newspapers point out that the war situation has already changed, and China is in a favorable position. The development of the war is about to reach a final critical juncture, at which time the Chinese army must implement new attacks. (Dispatch on the 12th)

(Paris) Today, all French evening newspapers said that the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island has made the Far East issue more complicated. Le Temps said that the whole problem lies in how long Japan occupies the island. If it is a permanent occupation, it will obviously violate the spirit of the 1907 Franco-Japanese Agreement, and France will encounter a situation of changing its focus, because the Japanese army is concentrated in a place that hinders France's interests that it cannot abandon. We have to demand that this point be explained. The only thing that the British and French governments can do is to change their position on the Sino-Japanese War. Le Débat said that although the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is not an immediate threat to Vietnam, it will ultimately make us uneasy. The occupation of this island from a military starting point will ultimately become a permanent occupation. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

(Paris) Le Temps recently commented on the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, saying that there is no doubt that the Japanese army, in view of the extremely strong Chinese resistance, has taken a vigorous offensive in South China and introduced it as a benefit. However, with regard to the issue of Hainan Island, China and France exchanged official documents in 1897, stipulating that China shall not cede the island to a third country, and France and Japan concluded an agreement in 1907, agreeing that all actions that are unfavorable to both parties should be avoided. Now that Japan has sent troops to land on the island, no matter what the reason, it will inevitably cause international problems, which can be asserted. It is even more obvious that the arguments used by Japan in this regard are difficult to convince people. "The main principle of the 1907 Franco-Japanese Agreement is to maintain the status quo of Hainan Island. Japan's occupation of the island now contradicts this principle. Moreover, the Japanese government has repeatedly provided assurances to the British and French ambassadors in Japan, declaring that it has no intention of occupying the island." At this point, the newspaper concluded that if the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is temporary, we may consider it not to contradict the exchange of documents in 1897 and the agreement in 1907, but if it is a long-term occupation, the situation will be very different. In other words, the interests that France holds in a certain area, that is, the interests that France can hardly abandon, will be greatly threatened due to the Japanese army's stationing there. Therefore, the duration of the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island must be clarified so that the attitudes adopted by the British and French governments towards the Sino-Japanese War and even the general situation in the Far East can be changed when necessary. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

(Paris) Observers here recently commented on the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, saying that it can be compared with the occupation of Mallorca Island in western Spain by Italian troops in the Mediterranean. These two islands are of extreme military strategic importance to Britain and France, and both sides are concerned and their attitudes will naturally be the same, and they will change from passive to active. In other words, the British and French governments have ordered their ambassadors to Japan to make representations to the Japanese government, informing them that the British and French governments are maintaining neutrality in the Sino-Japanese War, but on the condition that the interests of the respective countries are respected. In this regard, France has agreed to prohibit the transportation of military supplies to China through Vietnam, but on the condition that Japan respects the 1907 Franco-Japanese Agreement. Britain may, together with the United States, exert pressure on Japan's foreign trade and may at any time implement policies that are more favorable to China. (Havas dispatch, 11th)

(Rome) Italian newspapers recently commented on the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, saying that this move is enough to threaten the interests of the major powers in the Far East. The semi-official Italian Daily reported that "after the Japanese army occupied Hainan Island, the two bases of British Hong Kong Island and the French concession of Guangzhou Bay will be useless." Le Tribune reported that "the Japanese government is waiting with a calm and resolute attitude for the major powers to take diplomatic action." Il Giornale d'Italia reported (note, the official newspaper of Foreign Minister Ciano) that "the importance of the nature of the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is far more important than the fall of Tianjin or Guangzhou. The fall of Tianjin and Guangzhou is only enough to affect the economic interests of the major powers. The occupation of Hainan Island can change the entire situation." (Havas dispatch, 11th)

London: French Ambassador Corbin visited Foreign Secretary Cadogan this morning. The Sunday Times recently commented that the move was related to the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island. "The Japanese government had originally promised France that if it prohibited the transportation of military supplies to China through Vietnam, it would avoid occupying Hainan Island one day. Until this point, it has broken its promise and fattened itself, and it is said to be related to Italy's demands on France. The Italian and Japanese governments have been conducting close talks recently, and Italy has almost encouraged Japan to occupy Hainan Island. At that time, the general public still said that Japan had rejected it. Now we know that it is not so." (Havas dispatch, 11th)

### Guangzhou Japanese Army Uprising: Korean Soldiers

Many Japanese Officers and Soldiers Killed: Eight Hundred People Captured and Executed: A Glimpse of the Current Situation in Guangzhou

(Hong Kong) Many soldiers in the Guangzhou Japanese army are of Korean and Taiwanese origin. Unable to endure the oppression of the Japanese army, uprisings frequently occur. On the morning of the 8th, over six thousand Korean soldiers launched a large-scale uprising, killing many Japanese officers and soldiers. Upon hearing the news, Japanese military officer Ando Rikichi urgently dispatched a large army to encircle and suppress them. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting throughout the day, resulting in extremely heavy casualties. Later, with the landing and flanking attack of the Japanese Navy Marines, the uprising was finally quelled. Eight hundred leading officers, including Li, Yongji, and Jin Zhenling, were captured and executed. The rest were escorted back to their place of origin for further investigation. (12th dispatch)

The Japanese army intends to withdraw its troops three miles from Guangzhou after the Lunar New Year, leaving the Japanese military police and the puppet security office to maintain order in the city in order to lure citizens back to the city. (12th dispatch)

(Guangzhou) Various Japanese stores in Guangzhou city are now being established one after another. Several Japanese hotels have also opened, all employing female attendants. It is said that coffee shops will also appear soon. Most Japanese stores are department stores, stocking everything from beer and food to stoves and bicycles. Foreign goods such as Indian tea are also available. Payment is made in Japanese currency, but national currency and Hong Kong dollars can also be used at market prices. Most of the stores are located on Taiping Road. Banks such as the Yokohama Specie Bank have also reopened. It is said that the meat sold in the market has not been properly inspected by the health bureau. The Security Maintenance Association, under Japanese protection, is planning to reopen the municipal slaughterhouse and abolish the additional tax on butcher shops. Restrictions on coded telegrams have now been lifted; senders must submit their codes to the bureau for reference. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(Guangzhou) It has been over three months since Guangzhou fell last October, and there has been no sign of Chinese police officers. Now, these people have reappeared on some streets, as the Security Maintenance Association, under Japanese protection, recently recruited 300 people to form this new police force. New police stations have also been established in various districts. Currently, the city's police affairs will be jointly handled by the new police force and the Japanese military police.

The following is a summary of a conversation between General Wu and a foreign reporter regarding Toihara's three visits to Wu: First time: Toihara said, "Please, Marshal Wu, come out and save us, Japan." Wu replied, "I cannot save myself, how can I save others? The problem now is not who saves whom, but how to save." Second time: Toihara said, "Please, Marshal Wu, come out to mediate peace." Wu replied, "Please have the Emperor of your country and President Chiang Kai-shek both send me telegrams inviting me to mediate, then of course I can." Third time: Toihara said, "Please, Marshal Wu, come out to take on an important position to maintain the Sino-Japanese national problem."

(Valencia) After Republican Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Del Vayo arrived here yesterday, many other cabinet members, such as Minister Without Portfolio Vósboda Le, Minister of Transportation Trós Rivos, Minister of Finance Montañés, Minister of Agriculture Uribe, Minister of Public Works Sinat, Minister of Education Gómes Santos, as well as many ministry officials and members of parliament, have arrived one after another. After attending a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Negrín gave a statement to the press, saying, "After arriving here, I deeply feel the strong morale of the people. After talking with representatives of various parties, I know even more that comrades from all parties are willing to continue the war regardless of all difficulties, until national independence can be preserved and all Spanish compatriots resolve their differences and reconcile. Although the fighting on the Catalan front has ended, we must still use the central region as a base to continue the war and enjoy full power, supported by the people of the whole country."

(Madrid) After the Spanish Republican government moved back to Madrid, it held its first cabinet meeting this afternoon. Foreign Minister Vayo estimates that there are a total of 400,000 refugees from Catalonia in France. (11th Reuters dispatch)

(Paris) Spanish Republican Foreign Minister Vayo issued a declaration last night, answering outside criticisms of the Spanish government. The declaration stated: The Republican government is now completely located within Spanish territory, in a place untouched by the power of the Nationalist army. The Prime Minister and I arrived there and witnessed the spirit of perseverance and resilience that we have maintained for two and a half years. After talking with military leaders from various regions, we saw an even greater determination to unite from top to bottom and face dangers and difficulties, and the belief in continuing the war to seek final victory has never changed. It is gratifying. (12th Haitong dispatch)

(Burgos) The Nationalist authorities were very pleased to hear that Britain and France are preparing to recognize the Nationalist government as the legitimate government, but they believe that such recognition can be delayed a little longer and should not be conditional on the complete elimination of the Republican army's resistance or the complete withdrawal of German and Italian troops from Spain. The Spanish problem has now changed from military to political. The Nationalist army already has civil administrative work in the occupied areas. A Nationalist army spokesperson told a Reuters reporter today, "The situation in Catalonia is already known to the world, and it will be so in the future. We will definitely give the enemy a fair opportunity to speak, and there will be no retaliatory actions. If this sincerity is recognized by the people of Madrid and Valencia sooner, the war can end sooner." People here do not lightly believe the Republican government leaders' talk of fighting to the end, and the Nationalist army does not intend to compromise halfway. (11th Reuters dispatch)

### Germany and Italy Concerned About Franco Defecting

Britain and France Approaching the Nationalists: German and Italian Newspapers Still Express Jealousy

(Berlin) It is widely believed that the Spanish Nationalist ambassador to Germany today presented Emperor Hitler with a copy of General Franco's report detailing the progress of negotiations between Britain, France, and the Nationalist authorities. Officials here have not yet commented on these negotiations. However, it is reported that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop took the opportunity of a private visit by the French ambassador yesterday to ask him to convey to the French government that Germany does not consider itself directly affected by the Mediterranean problem, but it is not completely unrelated. (3rd Reuters dispatch)

### British Ship Sunk by Bomb

Several Nationalist military aircraft from Valencia bombed this port this morning, killing two residents and wounding twenty-five. The British merchant ship Lucky, which was anchored in the port, was hit by a bomb and sunk. (11th Havas dispatch)

(Berlin) The attitude of Britain and France towards the Spanish civil war is still unsatisfactory to the newspapers here, which say that the prolongation of the Spanish civil war is actually due to the actions of Britain and France and Bolshevism. The British policy always seeks to weaken Spain and uses all means to obstruct the country's restoration, thereby maintaining the status quo to protect its interests in the Mediterranean. The French goal is to ensure its transportation lines to its North African territories. The Cologne Newspaper stated, "After the change in the situation in the Spanish civil war, Britain allowed France to benefit from it. The comments made by some British and French newspapers after the Spanish Nationalist army occupied Minorca, regarding the urgent problems in the Mediterranean, and the increasingly tense Franco-Italian relations, are not enough to promote a solution." And the German Observer stated, "It is a crime for civilized countries around the world to want to obstruct the restoration of other nations. It is necessary to redistribute the Mediterranean powers, and this is even more necessary after the red forces suffered setbacks in Spain. This move has major historical implications and should not be taken lightly." (12th Havas dispatch)

(Rome) The Italian newspapers, which used to criticize Britain and France, all pointed to Britain and France as being hostile to the Spanish Nationalist government. However, now, seeing that Britain and France are gradually approaching the Nationalist government and feeling uneasy, they have begun to criticize them one after another. The semi-official Italian Daily stated, "Britain and France have now had to admit the victory of the Nationalist army, but at the same time they are trying to undermine it, trying to destroy the connection between the Nationalist government and Italy and Germany as soon as possible. This plan is actually to despise the spirit of chivalry and the rational of the government of the Spanish people. Inducing people to betray and be ungrateful is close to insult, is this something that the Spanish people would like to do? "We can trust the authorities of the Nationalist government, but we hope that the authorities can also pay attention to the attitude of Britain and France." (12th Havas dispatch)

(Rome) The semi-official Italian Daily commented on the Spanish issue a few days ago, saying that Italian volunteers must wait until the Spanish Nationalist army has achieved a complete victory in military and political terms before they can be recalled to their country. Afterwards, the international reaction was noisy, so today's argument is quite different, slightly saying, "The political victory of the Spanish Nationalist army is still threatened by external forces. If this victory still needs to be guaranteed in the future, then Italy will continue to assist the Nationalist army. However, the so-called political victory does not need to make any new definition, nor is it to force Spain's political system in the future to conform to fascism in a certain way. The political victory we are seeking is only to seek that the political system it adopts can conform to the will of the Spanish people and can eliminate external corruption and deteriorating forces. In a word, Spain belongs to the Spanish people. This is the golden rule that must be implemented." (12th Havas dispatch)

(Paris) Political figures here not only do not admit the possibility of Senator Bera having the determination to go to Burgos, but also believe that the possibility of Bera leaving in the near future exists, because there are still urgent issues to be resolved regarding Spanish refugees. As for the issue of sending ambassadors, it depends on how the situation develops before a decision can be made. It is not yet time to discuss it. (12th Haitong dispatch)

Political figures in Sensibat and here believe that the British government will recognize the Spanish Nationalist government before France. The reason why the French government is delaying the recognition of the Nationalist government is not because of the stubborn attitude of the extreme left, but because of how to deal with the large number of Republican military supplies that have been shipped to France. France has not yet obtained the consent of the Spanish Nationalist government. According to speculation in political circles here, the French government intends to confiscate them in order to compensate for the expenses of accommodating Spanish refugees. The shortfall will be compensated for by Spanish gold stored in France, but this is France's hope, and it will not be possible to agree on it in the short term. Since Britain has no such plans, it can recognize it first without further waiting. (12th Haitong dispatch)

Capital of Switzerland: The Swiss Federal Government intends to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government within the next week. (12th Havas dispatch)

### 240 US Warships Complete Gathering and Begin Major Maneuvers

(Washington) The United States fleet, which is preparing to conduct major maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea on Monday, has now completed its gathering, with a total of 140 warships, 600 aircraft, and 60,000 personnel. It is now based in Guantanamo and plans to depart for a secretly designated location on Monday to launch a large-scale offensive towards the Panama Canal. First, seize the area near the canal, and then control this important transportation route. If this offensive can be achieved, it will show the weakness of the defense forces in this area. Therefore, the result will definitely make Congress feel that the defense of this area cannot be delayed any longer, and President Roosevelt's continental defense plan will also be easily passed. It is reported that the scope of the offensive will start from the equator in the south and New York in the north, attacking key points and not being restricted to any one point.

### Soviet Russian Newspaper: Criticizing England and France

Wants to Strangle the Republic Again

(Moscow) The Pravda stated that the intervention in Spain has entered a new stage. In addition to the aggressive countries of Italy and Germany, Britain and France are also openly attempting to quickly strangle the Spanish Republic. Now the central part of the country has officially declared its determination to fight to the end, and the so-called peacemakers in Munich are using their old tricks to cover up their new crimes of destroying peace and democracy with a deceptive smoke screen. This plan to strangle the Spanish Republic is actually a further development of the imperialist war, a further development of fascist aggression, and its first goal is to harm the interests of the so-called democratic countries of Britain and France. Therefore, it is not without reason that public opinion in Britain and France has recently become increasingly opposed to this openly interventionist non-intervention policy. The British and French masses have more firmly demanded that food and weapons be supplied to the Spanish people. (10th TASS dispatch)

### France Purchased Aircraft from America: Another Mishap

The new twin-engine single-seat fighter plane manufactured by the Lockheed factory in Los Angeles can be called the world's fastest fighter plane, and it can also fly in the stratosphere. It is said that the weapons it is equipped with include several machine guns, but the factory strictly keeps it secret, and the details are not known. This plane recently departed from here and flew to New York, but unexpectedly, when it arrived at the Michael Airfield on the outskirts of New York, it suddenly collided with a tree and overturned, damaging the fuselage and slightly injuring the pilot. As for the speed of this flight, although it has not been announced, it is said that it is still inferior to the record of an average of 323 miles per hour set by the famous wealthy aviator Hughes on January 19, 1937. (11th Havas)

(New York) Lieutenant Bernardis Riley, who was piloting the new twin-engine single-seat fighter plane manufactured by the Lockheed factory, crashed when he arrived at the Michael Airfield here from Los Angeles yesterday. Lieutenant Bernardis Riley sustained minor injuries. The outside world knows nothing about the cause of the accident. One theory is that it collided with a tree, but it has not been confirmed. As for the time spent on this flight, according to official announcements, it was seven hours and forty-five minutes, which is also inferior to the record (seven hours, twenty-eight minutes, and twenty-five seconds) set by wealthy aviator Hughes in January 1937.

### Franco-German Relations

(Berlin) Germany today renewed its invitation to French Foreign Minister Bonnet to come to Berlin to discuss European issues with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In its invitation, Germany specifically hopes to pay attention to the Central European issue. Germany also notified the French government that French Foreign Minister Bonnet's visit to Berlin is a reasonable development that should occur after the Franco-German non-aggression pact. It is said that the French government is consulting with Britain regarding the upcoming Franco-German talks. (11th Associated Press dispatch)

(Paris) German Ambassador Welczek visited Foreign Minister Bonnet today and held talks. It is said that the main topic discussed was the measures taken by the French government against certain German expatriates in Paris. Recently, the French government expelled these expatriates on the grounds that their activities were detrimental to France. At the same time, Mr. and Mrs. Baron, reporters stationed in Paris for the Berlin Stock Exchange Gazette, have been arrested. The reason for this has nothing to do with their profession as journalists. Ambassador Welczek will surely take the opportunity to inquire about this when he meets with Foreign Minister Bonnet today.

### University of Chicago Welcomes Former Czech President to Lecture

Beneš Talks About the European Crisis: England and France Are to Blame for Their Weakness

(New York) Former Czech President Beneš came to the United States to lecture at the invitation of the University of Chicago. He attended a welcome meeting at the university last night and immediately gave a speech, saying that war is unlikely to break out in Europe in the near future, but the European situation is indeed very uneasy and will endanger world peace. We will make a big mistake if we underestimate the extent of this unease. As far as the Czech situation is concerned, our country was in danger of being dismembered due to the issue of ethnic minorities. This kind of tragedy is neither beginning with our country nor will it end with our country. The reason why the European situation is so chaotic is due to the weakening of the national power of the two major democratic countries of Western Europe. "The so-called appeasement policy can delay the disaster of war for a certain period of time. This is not to be denied, but the ideological and political differences between European countries are so profound, and the 'dynamic' countries' political aspirations cannot be satisfied. In that case, it is difficult to eliminate differences and resolve disputes without using war or causing major changes within certain countries." Beneš further analyzed the policies of force pursued by Germany and Italy and their aspirations, saying that these countries violated existing treaties, invaded other countries' borders, and expanded their armies on a large scale in peacetime. How can we hope that this will be beneficial to European peace and how can we hope that it will be compatible with the peaceful development of the democratic system? "In short, the European situation is already politically and socially chaotic, and this situation cannot last for a long time." "It can be asserted that after the European War, thanks to the help of the United States, our freedom and democratic system were able to be preserved, but it is a pity that the democratic countries of Western Europe failed to lead all countries to properly protect this inheritance in the past 20 years." Beneš finally concluded by praising the American democratic system, saying, "The United States is the place where the ideals of freedom and democracy are placed. I am very happy to be able to come and see it in person." (12th Havas dispatch)

### British Military Aircraft Crashes into Civilian House: Woman, Children, and Pilot Killed

(London) Today, an Air Force aircraft crashed into a Brighton civilian house in heavy fog and exploded.

### British Ship Catches Fire

Iron Bridge Nearly Blown Up

(London) Today, the British ship St. David, which arrived in Wales from Ireland, suddenly caught fire. It is widely believed that it was caused by arson. It is said that the fire broke out in the cabin, and it is now suspected that it was done by sympathizers of the Irish Republican Army. The crew, police, and local fire brigade worked hard to put out the fire. The ship did not suffer major damage, and no one was injured. The police detained several passengers on the St. David in Badenton. (11th Reuters dispatch)

(London) Today, three incendiary bombs were discovered on the tourist ship "St. David" which arrived here from Ireland. They had already caught fire and were burning, but because the rescue was early, they were extinguished in time. It is said that there were more than a thousand passengers on the ship. After the police checked them separately, they detained seven suspects. (11th Associated Press dispatch)

(London) Yesterday, two people suddenly attempted to blow up the new Frith Iron Bridge near Frith Hill. The bridge is the key point of the railway from London to Edinburgh. Fortunately, an unemployed miner saw it and stopped it. The worker bravely dragged one person down. While they were entangled, the police arrived, and the Iron Bridge was fortunately unharmed. According to the authorities, this incident was also instigated by the Irish Republican Army. Large numbers of police were ordered to check passengers at Patton Station. Many people who came from Ireland to London to see football matches were checked and nine people were arrested. (12th Haitong dispatch)

### Rangoon Uprising: 14 Killed

The reason was that Muslims opposed Hindus playing music in front of the mosque. The authorities have implemented martial law to prevent further disturbances. (12th Reuters dispatch)

### Some Americans Still Criticize Roosevelt

Internal Affairs Problems Re-Emerge in Poland; Certain Three Countries Invite Roosevelt to Tour Europe

(Washington) Recently, some American newspapers and political figures have been attacking President Roosevelt. This phenomenon has its origins in the long-standing controversy over the Supreme Court reform plan several years ago. The attacks on the president started then, and they are now resurfacing. Viewed in this light, the divisions are still based on differing domestic policy viewpoints, and these divisions are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. Moreover, some recent events have provided new material for the opposition to attack. These events include three aspects: First, during the congressional recess last year, President Roosevelt appointed Roberts as a judge for the Western Virginia District Court. When Congress reconvened, he requested ratification, but the Senate surprisingly rejected the appointment on the 6th of this month with a vote of 72 against 9. Regarding this matter, Senator Glass, a Democrat from Virginia, disagreed with President Roosevelt. Second, President Roosevelt had previously proposed a bill requesting an appropriation of $875,000,000 to implement engineering relief for the unemployed. Both houses of Congress amended and passed the bill, reducing the amount to $725,000,000. The President has already signed this law, and simultaneously submitted a message to Congress requesting approval of the $150,000,000 that was cut. Third, some members of the Senate Army Committee, who belong to the isolationist faction, have expressed dissatisfaction, saying that the President has not fully explained the government's current foreign policy. In short, some Democrats are now attacking the President, saying that the internal party attitudes are increasingly divided. With this lineup, participating in the 1940 election will weaken the Democratic Party's position. It is feared that the President will face strong opposition when Congress discusses foreign policy in the future. Fortunately, the public opinion supports the President, so the impact will not be significant. The opposition may not be able to form a strong group with a clear and firm banner. If the situation continues like this, the amendment of the Neutrality Act will inevitably be delayed for discussion. (Havas, 12th)

(Paris) The continental edition of the London Daily Mail recently reported that the ambassadors of certain three European countries to the United States have inquired whether President Roosevelt could visit Europe. American officials immediately indicated that the President is too busy to travel abroad during his term. Political figures here attach great importance to the phrase "during his term." In New York, it is believed that when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England visited the United States in June of this year, they personally invited President and Mrs. Roosevelt to visit England. Whether President Roosevelt will make the trip depends on whether he will run in the 1940 election. If he does not run, he may accept the invitation. Otherwise, "If the European situation becomes increasingly serious, to the point of potentially causing war, and Europe can convene an international conference to discuss ways to eliminate the scourge of war, then President Roosevelt will probably not hesitate to make a trip to Europe. This is what everyone deeply believes." (Havas, 12th)

### Japan Revises Measures to Restrict Foreigners

(Tokyo) Regarding the regulations for controlling the entry of foreigners, a stricter revised method will be implemented from May. The total number of foreigners coming to Japan each year, including residents and tourists, is between 30,000 and 40,000. The total number of foreigners currently residing in Japan is 30,000, of which Chinese account for 14,000. Under this new regulation, foreigners with bad behavior or suspected of communism or espionage may be deported immediately, which is faster than the old regulations. However, those foreigners residing or traveling in Japan who are considered very appropriate will be given better protection. According to the current regulations, foreigners only need to register at the police station 90 days after arriving in Japan to reside for a long time. The new method in the future stipulates that they must register 30 days after arriving in Japan, and then register a second time after 60 days. In the future, they must register once a year. Those who violate the entry regulations will be sentenced to three months in prison or a fine of 100 yuan. The entry fee will be 20 yuan, and a transit fee of 10 yuan must be paid. (Reuters, 12th)

(Washington) Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha held talks with Undersecretary of State Welles and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau for one hour today, exchanging views on general issues. U.S. officials have refused to disclose how the meeting went.

### Beiping Will Restrict the Circulation of National Currency

(Beiping) According to the proclamation of the "Provisional Government," the banknotes issued by the three central government banks will not be allowed to circulate from March 10, and the banknotes of the banks in Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Shandong provinces will also not be allowed to be used.

### Haiphong's Transit Cargo Transportation Increases Sharply

Haiphong is now the best port for goods to be transported from there to the Chinese mainland. Therefore, business is very prosperous. According to the Chamber of Commerce report, the port's income has doubled compared to before. Currently, there are two British and French shipping companies operating in Haiphong, and several other shipping companies. Due to the impact of the fall of Guangzhou, they have applied for permission for their ships to travel to and from Haiphong. A certain French shipping company has written to the authorities, saying that Haiphong's berthing facilities are limited and have been fully utilized. It is not appropriate to allow other companies to operate in this area. Even in the current environment, goods arriving in Haiphong often have to be stored for several months before they can be transported to the Chinese mainland. The reason for this is partly that the Haiphong-Kunming Railway, with its limited facilities, cannot meet the current needs. As a result, the goods that are shipped in lack warehouses, and thousands of cargo boxes are piled up in the dock. According to officials here, the goods transported to the Chinese mainland are only factory supplies, so they are allowed to be transported without involving any issues of violating neutrality. The authorities are very strict in inspecting the goods that are shipped in. Sometimes, due to excessive examination, the shipping companies often complain that the application for shipping permits is slow and time-consuming. There are now one to two thousand cars, mostly made in the United States, waiting to be transported here. A large part of them are transferred from Hong Kong to Haiphong because they cannot be transported to the mainland via Guangzhou through Hong Kong. Each train on the Haiphong-Kunming Railway can only carry 100 tons, so it will take some time for these cars to be transported to Kunming. (Reuters, 12th)

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Launches the New Life Women's Work Team

### Although the Chinese People Suffer from the Pain of War, They Still Hope to Continue the Resistance War. The Cooperation Between the Military and the People is Firm. Students Participate in Nursing Work. A Western Woman Talks About Her Return from the Battlefield.

The Continental News reports that a Western woman has just returned to Shanghai from a tour of the entire battle line from Shanxi to Guangdong. Yesterday (the 11th), she told reporters that the Chinese military and people have suffered the most from the war, but they are also the ones who hope to continue the resistance.

Regarding military-civilian cooperation, the woman first followed the Eighth Route Army in Shanxi Province across the plains of Hubei Province and a part of Hunan Province, then went straight down to the mountainous area of southern Hunan and entered the northwest of Guangxi. A few days before the fall of Hankou, she and dozens of Chinese male and female students from the War Relief Corps withdrew from Hankou with a certain unit of the Chinese army. She also participated in relief work, taking care of wounded soldiers and refugees. After staying in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces for several months, she was deeply impressed by the close cooperation between the regular and irregular troops and the people. She once participated in a military-civilian gathering held by soldiers in a certain village in Shanxi Province. In addition to expressing a cordial spirit, the soldiers also distributed hundreds of cans of captured canned meat to the villagers. According to the woman, the cooperation between the military and the people is crucial in the Chinese resistance war. This kind of cooperation is most evident in the Eighth Route Army's operational areas because the people in these areas have received better training than in other places. Through the tireless guidance of the army, the people understand that if China wants to win the war, the people must assist the army. The woman also described everything she experienced when she withdrew from the towns that were about to fall. As dusk approached, we urgently needed to find a place to stay, but the villagers in the village would not provide food or lodging. The students were indignant when they saw this situation, but the soldiers immediately comforted them, then summoned the village chief and told him what had happened and promised that they would pay for everything they provided. Thanks to the soldiers' eloquent tongues, we were finally able to get food and lodging. In the areas not far from the front lines, she encountered countless refugees heading west. They suffered a lot, but they had absolutely no resentment towards the war. In Hengyang, she met a twelve-year-old boy who was about to leave for Guangxi. According to the boy, he had been wandering around since the fall of Nanjing, and he almost died in the fire in the Changsha fire.

Sufficient supply. The woman criticized the supply of the Chinese army, saying that the troops she contacted had a fairly sufficient supply of food. In the months she inspected and worked on the front lines of the Chinese army, she never saw soldiers fighting on an empty stomach. On this point, she highly praised the semi-official industrial cooperatives, saying that these cooperatives not only help the unemployed and refugees, but also provide the army with essential supplies. Every time she went to the front line, she encountered countless medical teams and Red Cross workers. The efficiency of the former is increasing day by day, while the latter is engaged in admirable work, not only rescuing wounded soldiers, but also taking care of refugees. Other non-military personnel on the front line include hundreds of students, teams from war relief organizations, and many drama troupes. Male and female students spread the deeds of the resistance war in the countryside, so that the masses would be encouraged to assist in the resistance war. War relief teams set up relay stations and storytellers for the soldiers in the areas closest to the front lines. In the countryside not far from the front lines, there were drama troupes performing patriotic dramas with the background of the resistance war to farmers and villagers. These drama troupes are especially popular with most farmers because they all like to watch the dramas performed by the drama troupes. In many places in the interior, imported goods have almost disappeared, and Guilin can be said to be the most. Due to foreign exchange and government encouragement, people in the interior are now willing to use all domestic products.

### The Past and Present of Yunnan's Finance: More Than Ten Banks Newly Moved In. Three Types of Paper Money Are in Circulation.

Kunming Correspondence: Before the first year of the Republic of China, the financial organization of Yunnan Province was no different from that of other provinces in the interior. At that time, money shops and ticket shops were engaged in deposit, remittance and exchange business, and acted as agents for the national treasury and other affairs, which were exactly the same as today's banks. Among them, Baichuantong of the Shanxi gang and Tianshunxiang of the Yunnan gang were especially known as giants. Yunnan is a province receiving subsidies, and every year subsidies are allocated from Sichuan Province, most of which are remitted by Baichuantong Tianshunxiang and others. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the Daqing Bank was established. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Daqing Bank was renamed the Bank of China, and banknotes were issued in accordance with the provisional regulations on the exchange of banknotes of the Bank of China drafted by the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, Yunnan Province raised 5 million yuan to establish the Fudian Bank. When the National Protection War broke out, the Bank of China was suspended. After that, the finance of Yunnan Province was centered on the Fudian Bank. At the beginning of the bank's opening, the preparations were sufficient, and the credit was stable. The exchange rate of Yunnan currency against foreign currency was often balanced with Shanghai and Hong Kong. Later, due to the wars to protect the country and build the country, Yunnan Province, with the financial resources of one province, had to bear the burden alone, and the expenditures were huge. Due to insufficient financial resources, it had to issue excess paper money, and once restricted and stopped cash payment. As a result, the paper money of Fudian Bank fell to the point where one yuan was only worth one yuan of national currency. This kind of paper money is the old Yunnan banknote that is currently on the market. This is the financial situation before the tenth year of the Republic of China.

Past situation. Until the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the current Yunnan Provincial Government was reorganized and established. In view of the previous financial destruction, due to insufficient financial resources, excess paper money was issued. The lower the currency price, the less the actual fiscal revenue, and the more insufficient to pay for the normal supply. Financial resources were destroyed due to financial reasons, and finance was affected due to financial reasons. It was decided to reorganize finance and finance at the same time. At that time, the method to start was to determine the province's semi-open silver coins as the standard currency. All income and expenditure are based on the standard currency. The old banknotes issued by Fudian Bank in the past were exchanged and destroyed at the rate of five yuan for one yuan of standard currency. Those that were not destroyed were temporarily circulated in the market at this exchange rate, which is actually equivalent to the subsidiary currency of the standard currency. After the implementation of the standard currency, the actual fiscal revenue increased, and the expenditure was reduced as much as possible, and it did not increase proportionally. Millions of yuan of standard currency were saved every year to organize a financial reorganization committee, purchase silver bars, and issue semi-open silver coins at the mint. The Fudian Bank was closed, and the Financial Reorganization Committee allocated 16 million yuan of silver coins to establish the Fudian New Bank in September of the 21st year of the Republic of China, and issued Fudian new paper money to be used at the same time as semi-open silver coins, with unlimited cash payment. Since then, one yuan of the new currency of Fudian Bank is often slightly equal to 50 cents of the national currency due to the silver content and quality. Although there are occasional fluctuations, the difference is very small due to the urgency of the demand for funds in Shen and Dian. Since the implementation of legal tender, the central paper money, the old paper money of Fudian, and the new currency of Fudian are all circulating in the market, and the old currency of Fudian is still used to exchange one yuan of the new currency for five yuan. This is a rough overview of the financial situation in Yunnan Province in the past 20 years.

Current situation. As for the current financial institutions in Yunnan Province, they are as follows: Provincial Government Banks: (A) Fudian New Bank, located on Weiyuan Street, is the financial center of the province. It was reorganized from the former Fudian Bank in the 21st year of the Republic of China. The capital is 16 million yuan of semi-open silver coins in the province, specializing in deposit, loan, remittance, and acceptance business. The head office is located in Kunming, with branches in Gejiu, Xiaguan, Zhaotong, and Shanghai, and offices in Hong Kong, Heijing District, Luoping, Nanning, Xufu, and Hankou. From the opening of the bank in the 21st year to the second half of the 24th year, the total amount of loans was more than 16 million yuan, the total amount of deposits was more than 24 million yuan, the reserve fund was more than 1.2 million yuan, and the pure profit over the years was more than 2.7 million yuan. (B) Quanye Bank, located in Gaoshanpu, was established with funds allocated by the Construction Department and the former Agricultural and Mining Department. The fund is 100,000 yuan of new semi-open silver coins, specializing in deposit and loan business. It was established in the 21st year of the Republic of China. The head office is located in Kunming, with a branch in Jianjiu. (C) Industrial Cooperation Bank, the new address is at Mashikou, South Huashan Road. It was expanded and reorganized from the Industrial Bank Preparatory Office previously run by the Construction Department. The total fund is set at 120,000 yuan of new silver coins, specializing in small loans, assisting industry and commerce, and relieving rural areas. It has been established for five years. (D) Nonggong Bank is currently under preparation and has not yet been formally established. All planning matters are entrusted to Fudian New Bank. Its fund is temporarily allocated 200 yuan of new currency from the National Salvation Fund, and a fund management committee for the bank is temporarily set up to be responsible for the management and use of the fund. Foreign Banks: (A) Banque de l'Indochine, on Jinbi Road, was opened by French businessmen. Before the 18th year of the Republic of China, the finance of the province was in chaos, and the bank's business was once prosperous. Now that the finance of the province has become stable, but because the freight rate of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Annam transit tax must be based on Vietnamese currency, the bank still has a part of its power in Yunnan. As for the exchange and deposit of funds between ordinary merchants and Shengang, they mostly trade in domestic banks and silver shops. Silver Shops: (A) Xingwen Guanyin Shop, located on Zhengyi Road, was originally Yuwendang, established in the 19th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, engaged in remittance and pawnshop business. Since the Republic of China, it has been reformed many times. After the Finance Department joined the official shares, it was changed to Guanyin Shop. Its total capital is 3 million yuan of new currency, and the scope of business is also larger than before. In addition to deposit, loan, trust and pawnshop items, it also handles the collection and disbursement of treasury and education funds, military and political funds, etc. for the Finance Department. (B) Yongfeng Silver Industry Company, located on Zhengyi Road, was established in the 21st year of the Republic of China. The merchant capital operates exclusively in deposit, loan, savings, remittance, trust, and acceptance business, and also handles the agency business of transportation, salt industry, and other banks in Shanghai and Hong Kong. (C) Yihua Yin Shop, located on Zhengyi Road, Yihua Pawnshop was established in the 17th year of the Republic of China, and then reorganized in the 21st year of the Republic of China to establish Yihua Yin Shop, with a capital amount of 200,000 yuan in cash, which is purely merchant shares. The main business is deposit, loan, and pawnshop. (D) Xiwu Yin Shop, located on Weiyuan Street, was established by the Yunnan Xiwu Company, which is jointly operated by the government and merchants, specializing in deposit, loan, and remittance business. (E) Dongchuan Mining Yin Shop, located on Xiangyan Street, was established by the Dongchuan Mining Company, which is jointly operated by the government and merchants, specializing in deposit, loan, and trust business.

The various banks that moved to Yunnan. Since the all-out war of resistance began, the Japanese have used their elite weapons and fierce artillery fire in an attempt to achieve a quick victory. However, the victory or defeat of the war depends on how solid the financial foundation of our country is. After 18 months of the war of resistance, the southwestern provinces have formed an important rear area and a hub for foreign trade. Therefore, various financial institutions have moved to Yunnan one after another in order to develop rich resources, communicate foreign trade, stabilize the domestic market, and consolidate the foundation of the war of resistance. According to statistics, there are eleven banks that have moved to Yunnan successively, including the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, Shanghai, Jincheng, Xinhua, and Juxingcheng. The business operations and general situation of each bank are recorded as follows:

The Central Bank is located on Hukuo Road. The head office is located in Shanghai. After Shanghai fell, it was moved to Hankou. After Wuhan was abandoned, it was moved to Chongqing. Some of the branches in the occupied areas were abolished, and some were reduced. This city is a first-class branch with a manager and a deputy manager. There are seven departments under it: accounting, treasury, document, business, remittance, cashier and tax collection. Each department has one middle-level person and several staff members. The main business is remittance and acting as agent for the national treasury. However, in terms of remittance, due to the current period of resistance war and the control of foreign exchange, those who want to remit funds abroad must first contact the Ministry of Finance. Only after obtaining permission can the bank handle it. The current British exchange rate is still in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, with each yuan being equivalent to one shilling, two pence and one-quarter. As for deposits, there are more transactions with various institutions and fewer transactions with individuals. There is no fixed regulation on interest rates, and the method is changed according to local conditions. However, deposits are not for profit. If there is a need in the market, subsidiary currency will be promoted at any time. The manager of the Kunming branch is Xu Boming, and the assistant manager is Wang Dake.

Bank of China is located on Hukuo Road. Because it is under construction, a temporary business office is temporarily located at No. 10 Qinyan Street. In the past, the head office was located in Shanghai. Because Shanghai fell, a part of it has been moved to Hong Kong and Chongqing. The branch in this city operates international remittance business in accordance with the government's regulations. However, recently, due to the control of foreign exchange, it must first obtain the permission of the Ministry of Finance before it can make foreign remittances. In addition to the business, accounting, cashier, acceptance, insurance, and warehouse departments, the bank also has a savings department to handle various savings deposits. Recently, due to the development of the southwest, it has been making efforts to assist in the industrial and commercial fields. The manager of the Kunming branch is Zhu Zhenfang.

Bank of Communications specializes in developing national industrial affairs. Xu Baiyuan, the manager of the Kunming branch, has arrived in Yunnan to prepare for the opening. He has selected the location of the bank on Jinbi Road and is building a new building. It will open on February 1st. The current preparatory office is located on South Huashan Road.

Farmers Bank. The head office is currently located in Chongqing. Recently, in order to complete the southwest financial network, branches are being established in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Kang and other provinces. As for the bank's business, in addition to the general bank's deposit, loan, savings and remittance, rural loans are mainly aimed at rural cooperatives. In the early days, when the cooperative administrative organs in various provinces were not yet universally established, the bank had assumed the responsibility of guiding the organization of cooperatives. Now it has decided to change this responsibility to the cooperative administrative organs in various provinces. The bank is only responsible for assisting and reviewing loan responsibilities. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, it has made more efforts to promote the cooperative cause. Compared with the loan figures before and recently, the increase has been more than doubled. The manager of the Kunming branch is Xu Shaogu, and the assistant manager is Zhang Boqi.

Shanghai Bank Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank. Its main business is mostly civilian savings, with an interest rate of 4% per week. Loans are focused on daily necessities, such as rice, salt, and cotton cloth, which is also to meet the needs of civilians. Cheng Shunyuan is the manager of the Kunming branch, and Li Mingsheng is the assistant manager. The bank has only been open in this city for more than four months, and the business situation is still good. The address is located on Zhengyi Road.

Jincheng Bank. The bank is a commercial bank. The head office is located in Shanghai. The business policy is to first investigate the local needs as the basis for investment, and then follow the three principles of stability, flexibility and public welfare. The business of the Kunming branch is still developing. The manager of the branch is Wu Xiaoyuan, and the address is located at No. 305 Jinbi Road.

Xinhua Bank. Since the opening of the Kunming branch, the total amount of loans has been more than 100,000 yuan. Recently, the bank plans to invest in Kunming Business Company and advance funds for southwest transportation vehicles. Due to the war, the bank's northern business is not as good as in the past. The head office has now moved to Shanghai. The situation of the branch in this city is still considerable. Xu Zhendong is the manager of the Kunming branch, and Qian Yi and Li Yangxing are the assistant managers. The address is located at Jinma Archway.

Juxingcheng Bank. The head office is located in Chongqing. In order to connect the trade between Yunnan and Sichuan, it has come to Yunnan to establish a branch. Its main business is divided into three departments: bank, savings and trust. The interest rate of the bank's savings department is in accordance with the savings law of the Ministry of Finance. Loans are determined according to local customs. Ma Shuwen is the manager of the Kunming branch, and Xie Wentong is the assistant manager.

Sichuan Provincial Bank. The head office is located in Chongqing. In order to connect southwest finance and facilitate industrial and commercial trade, it has come to Yunnan to establish a branch. The bank's main business is to act as the agent for the Sichuan Provincial Treasury and also engage in all bank business. There are three departments: savings, trust and warehouse. It has not been in Yunnan for a long time and is still in the preparation period. Chen Fengqiao is the manager of the Kunming branch, and the address is on Hukuo Road. The Chongqing head office issues 50-cent subsidiary currency notes that are circulating in the market.

Meifeng Bank was established in the 11th year of the Republic of China and has a history of 18 years. The head office is located in Chongqing. It has recently come to Yunnan to prepare for the establishment of a branch. The address has been selected on Hukuo Road, and the houses are being repaired. Business can be started soon. Zhou Keming and Chu Zhaoxi are the managers of the Kunming branch.

Chongqing Bank was established in the 19th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the real name was the Citizens Bank. It was renamed Chongqing Bank in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Since Kunming has been an important channel for import and export since the war of resistance, it has come to Yunnan to prepare for the establishment of a branch. It has been two months, but it has not yet officially opened. The current address is being searched for, and the remaining houses of the Sichuan Provincial Bank on Hukuo Road are temporarily used as offices. The head office is located in Chongqing. The bank's loans are mostly for goods mortgage and public debt trading. Tu Shaoyu is the manager of the Ming branch. (To be continued)

### Assassination Cases Occur Frequently in Wuxi. Announcements to Eliminate Traitors Are Found in the Market.

The Pseudo-Officials Are All Frightened and Discolored.

Wuxi Express: In recent months, terror incidents have occurred frequently in the society of Muye. For example, Zhong Jihe, a pseudo-member of the Chenli Society, was killed in a downtown area, and Bai Jin destroyed the office of the special agent police in the north of the city of the pseudo-county government, and shot and killed three special agent policemen and two Japanese soldiers. Also, in the Washington Hotel in the Japanese military and police guarded area, two senior Japanese military officers were shot and killed, and recently, Wu Zhengrong, the chief of political police of the pseudo-county government, was killed on January 28 in the bustling market in the center of the city. There have been no less than dozens of cases one after another, so the general pseudo-officials are frightened and live in seclusion.

Japanese soldiers were killed. It has not been half a month since the Wu Zhengrong case occurred. Yesterday (the 10th), at about 6:40 pm, two Japanese soldiers were shot and killed in the southwest and second districts of the city at the same time. One case was at the entrance of Taiping Lane inside the West City Gate. The Japanese soldier who was killed was a soldier of the Japanese garrison team, named "Kawamoto Taro." He was originally responsible for guarding the West City Gate. After leaving work at 6 pm yesterday, as soon as he walked to the entrance of Taiping Lane (80 meters away from the city), gunshots rang out suddenly, and the Japanese soldier immediately fell to the ground in response. The bullet entered from the right temple and exited from the back of the head. Because the injury was to a vital part, the Japanese soldier soon died. The Japanese soldiers guarding the city rushed over upon hearing the sound, but the assassin had long disappeared. When this happened in the West Gate, unexpectedly, a similar incident occurred at the same time near the Heping Bridge inside the South Gate. The person who was killed was also a Japanese soldier named "Matsuki Nagato." The reason why the Heping Bridge is very close to the Yi Fu Ban, so a small team of Japanese soldiers from the Japanese Itaban Headquarters, about 40 people, was stationed in the Hua residence at the north end of the bridge to protect the Yi Fu Ban. "Matsuki Nagato" was just standing guard at the entrance of the team at that time, when a young man aimed a ruthless bullet at him, entering from the left cheekbone and not penetrating. He immediately fell to the ground in response. Seeing that the purpose had been achieved, the young man calmly went to the South Gate. When the Japanese soldiers of the team found out, the murderer had already escaped far away. After two Japanese soldiers were shot and killed in the downtown area at the same time, the social atmosphere suddenly became tense. The Japanese authorities believed that there must be a large number of remnants hiding in the city, so they immediately closed the four city gates earlier and sent a large number of military and police to search every household within 100 meters of the scene of the incident. As a result, the residents were innocently frightened and gained nothing. However, the Japanese side attached great importance to this incident and believed that there must be a well-organized assassination organization lurking in the city. Therefore, yesterday, it ordered the pseudo-authorities to solve the case within 48 hours. The pseudo-authorities felt that it was a thorny issue after receiving the order.

The announcement was found. While the whole city was in panic, this morning (the 11th) at dawn, three announcements were found on the bulletin boards in front of the pseudo-county government and the Chong'an Temple mountain gate, and near the pseudo-police station on Xuefo Road. The texts were the same, but no one knew who posted them or when. Because the gates of the pseudo-county government and the pseudo-police station were closed after 9 pm every night and no guards were set up, the announcement was not discovered until the gate was opened at 6 am at dawn. Later, the pseudo-police immediately tore it down and reported it to the pseudo-authorities. As for the content of the announcement, the general idea is that "This group is ordered to come to Xiyi to handle the work of punishing traitors. All my compatriots, please do not disturb yourselves. You should give the members of our group the same protection. After 9 pm, if there is no special reason, please do not go out, so as to facilitate the work of our group and avoid accidental injuries to life," etc. Since the discovery of this announcement, because the pseudo-authorities have kept it secret, rumors have sprung up in the society, and the rumors are different. The general pseudo-officials are all frightened to the point of losing their souls.

### Jiangxi Province Establishes a Trade Department to Control the Transportation of Rice to Zhejiang.

Cigarettes and Other Goods are Subject to Controlled Imports.

Jinhua Correspondence: In order to promote the sales of Jiangxi products, increase foreign trade, control the import of essential goods, allocate and regulate supply and demand, and develop the economy for all the people, the Jiangxi Provincial Government established the Jiangxi Provincial Wartime Trade Department, which is jointly managed by Yang Chuo'an, the director of the Construction Department, and Wen Qun, the director of the Finance Department. The total capital is more than 4 million, and the central government will assist in the organization. In order to expand business, six offices have been established in important locations inside and outside the province, including: 1. Zhangshu, 2. Ji'an, 3. Ganzhou, 4. Motan, 5. Linchuan, 6. Yunmenling. Each has a manager responsible for presiding over its affairs, and all have started working. As Zhejiang Province and Jiangxi Province are adjacent to each other and are also a transportation hub directly connecting the interior, in order to establish close relations with various trades in other provinces and seek to communicate, a special office has been established in Jinhua, and Hui Xin, a technician from the Jiangxi Construction Department, has been sent to Jinhua to prepare for and start work. At the moment, Jiangxi is a rice-producing area, and a huge amount of rice is exported every year. In order to prevent merchants from manipulating, restrict wartime profits, and suppress the civilian food selling price, a contract has been signed with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to control transportation. Rice merchants from all over the country who transport and export must contact the Trade Department to purchase and can designate the location for delivery, and will be given various conveniences, otherwise the Railway Bureau will not be able to load and transport them. As for the controlled imports to Jiangxi, several types such as cigarettes, matches, cotton yarn, cotton, and oil have been stipulated. The amount required by each province will be uniformly purchased by the Trade Department from outside the province and transported to Jiangxi to meet the demand.

### Lively Mood Among People on the Banks of the Fuchun River

Xiaoshan Correspondence: Linpu Town is the intersection of Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Fuyang in eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, it is the largest commercial market under the jurisdiction of Xiaoshan and Shaoxing counties. It is especially a distribution center for rice from several counties in eastern Zhejiang. The total number of rice bags transported here from various places reaches more than 50,000 per day. It is also a transit area for large quantities of edible salt, so the number of salt boats gathering here daily is at most three or four hundred, and at least one hundred or so. In addition to these, it is also a financial center for Xindeng, Tonglu, Zhuji, Fuyang, and other counties. As for Dayuan, it is a strategically important town under the jurisdiction of Fuyang, located on the bank of the Fuchun River. Because it is across the river from the county seat, it still maintains its pristine state. The national character here is absolutely different from the weakness of the Fuyang people. Both men and women have strong and sturdy bodies. This is a unique gift of the spirit of mountain dwellers. The importance of Dayuan and Linpu seems to be slightly different. Although both towns are located on a winding mountain road line of about seventy miles from Xiaoshan to the Fuchun River, the importance of Linpu, in terms of the current situation, is still mainly commercial. As for Dayuan, it is a major military defense point. Since the fall of Fuyang, the Japanese army has tried to cross over at Dayuan several times, but has never succeeded. Recently, the soldiers stationed in Daoli crossed the river and drove out the Japanese soldiers trapped in Fuyang city in one go. Later, due to strategic reasons, the city was abandoned. The mood of the people here is hotter than fire. Every village and every family has self-defense weapons such as homemade cannons, homemade guns, broadswords, and iron rulers. In the past, there were often armed clashes between villages, but now they are awakened and united. In addition to many brave men volunteering, they are also using the original subsidies for those who died in armed conflicts as funds for organizing local defense. Now, the local defense groups they have spontaneously formed have long been established. Villagers in all villages have already been issued weapons and started training by the Changju. In addition to farming, they receive ample time for military common sense every day.

### Xie Ke Takes Office as Puppet Mayor of Hangzhou

Hangzhou Correspondence: After He Zan, the puppet mayor of Hangzhou, was assassinated, the puppet provincial government initially announced that Xu Shouchong, the puppet director of the Social Affairs Bureau, would concurrently hold the position. Recently, the puppet Ministry of Interior appointed Xie Ke, the former puppet secretary-general, to succeed him. It is reported that Xie took up the puppet post the day before yesterday.

### Japanese Counterattack and Bridge Ambush at Zhou Tie Bridge

Wuxi Correspondence: After the Chinese army recovered Heqiao in Yixing, it withdrew from the town on the dawn of the ninth due to the threat of Japanese aircraft and artillery. It is now holding the line at Dujia, about three miles from the town. The Japanese army, fearing an ambush by the Chinese, did not enter the town until 2 PM on the ninth. Currently, fierce fighting is taking place between the two sides at Dujiaba. Jiling Bridge on the Xiyi Highway is generally still under the control of the Chinese army, and highway traffic is still blocked. Later, the Japanese sent a unit to advance towards Zhou Tie Bridge, intending to cut off the Chinese army's rear. When the Japanese army arrived on the west bank of Zhou Tie Bridge, the Chinese had already set up an ambush and immediately launched an attack. The Japanese army was caught off guard and immediately retreated, and more than eighty Japanese soldiers were killed by the Chinese. More than one hundred rifles, two small cannons, and countless bullets were captured, and a Japanese sergeant was captured and sent to a certain headquarters for interrogation. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses in this battle.

### Japanese Consul Asks for Suppression of Terrorist Activities, Shanghai Municipal Council Clarifies Stance

Rampant Gambling and Opium Dens in the Western District Are the Lair of Gangsters, Repeated Assassinations and Robberies Are Committed by These Groups

The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office issued a statement saying that the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy stated at a recent meeting with the press that the Japanese Consul General had protested to the Municipal Council regarding the recent terrorist acts. In view of this statement, which has been reported in the newspapers, the Council believes that it should truthfully inform taxpayers of the attitude taken by the Chairman of the Board at the meeting with the Japanese Consul General in order to demonstrate responsibility.

Vigilance Measures Are Reported to Be Effective: The Chairman of the Board said that the Council shares the deep regret of the Japanese authorities regarding the recent acts of terrorism, but he believes that the Council's police force has not made any mistakes in vigilance. The Chairman of the Board said that the Council is always prepared to accept and consider any concrete suggestions. However, based on the reports received, the police force has clearly taken all possible measures within the scope of what can be implemented. The police force arrested one hundred and forty-four armed criminals and seized eighteen pistols between the first and eighth of this month. These facts can serve as examples of the police force's implementation of security measures, as pointed out by the Chairman of the Board to the Japanese Consul General.

Outlaw Gangsters Cannot Be Suppressed Outside the Boundary: The Chairman of the Board said that unless the Japanese authorities can further cooperate to clear up the areas adjacent to the roads outside the boundary, the police force cannot achieve satisfactory results in dealing with terrorist acts. The areas adjacent to the roads outside the boundary, i.e., outside the Council's jurisdiction, have more than twenty gambling dens and at least eighteen known opium dens. It is known that most of these places are openly protected by the Japanese. These areas have become the lair of gangsters. These groups operate from these areas and commit acts of violence within the Settlement or on the roads outside the Council's jurisdiction, and then escape back to their original location. This result is inevitable. The police force's report stated that there are at least two large and dangerous gangs. Their activities have been thoroughly investigated using police scientific methods and have undoubtedly caused many acts of violence. One of these gangs was broken up by the Council's police force in Fahua Town, but two of the gang leaders escaped from the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government Police Bureau" under Japanese supervision.

Numerous Cases Committed by Gangsters in the Western District: On August 28 of last year, the Council received the first piece of news stating that an organized gang was active in the Western District. On that day, members of the gang blocked the road and robbed people in an alley near Kainar Road. Since then, there have been eighteen more cases, which have been found to be related to the gang after examining bullet casings or bullets. The assassination of a detective of the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government Police Bureau" on February 2 of this year and the assassination of a member of the "Foil Tax Bureau" on February 7 of the same month are also related to the gang.

Hope for Deep Cooperation from the Japanese Side: The Chairman of the Board of the Council expressed his gratitude for the cooperation that the Japanese Military Police have already implemented, but strongly stated that deeper cooperation from the Japanese authorities is necessary for the security of the Western District. The Chairman of the Board did not mean that the city could permanently eliminate armed crime, but it can be confidently asserted that security in the Western District will improve significantly if it can be cleared up. In large cities, it is obviously impossible to eliminate all crime in a metropolis crowded with refugees. The Chairman of the Board continued that the Japanese Military Police have repeatedly warned pro-Japanese Chinese officials at the request of the Council's police force to try to avoid habitual actions and not to travel the same route every day. The police force has also requested that all gatherings and meetings be reported in advance so that special security can be provided, but these requests have not been complied with.

### Normal Shipping Between Shanghai and Vietnam After Sudden Change in Hainan Island Situation

Shipping routes between Hong Kong and Shanghai will definitely not be affected

According to sources in the transportation industry in this city, the recent activities of the Japanese navy in the waters off Hainan Island have not had a serious impact on the shipping routes from Shanghai or Hong Kong to Haiphong. Only the passenger and cargo transport business in Guangzhou Bay and Beihai ports has been affected. Therefore, foreign shipping companies are still maintaining their voyages, and no accidents have occurred in the past two months. Although the situation in Xuwen and Hai'an, across from Haikou, is very serious after the Japanese navy landed on Hainan Island, shipping operations can still maintain the status quo. Moreover, Haiphong is located in Vietnam, and it is even more difficult for Japanese warships to interfere. Currently, foreign ships on the shipping routes from Hong Kong and Shanghai to Haiphong are still operating normally and will definitely not be affected.

### Failure to Seize and Unload Sand and Gravel, Sand and Gravel Workers Go on Strike

The Guild Sends a Letter Requesting Justice and Assistance, Resolving That Fishing Boats Should Not Barge Sand with Pseudo-Organizations

After the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Industry opposed the use of special forces to organize a monopoly company and illegally detain sand and gravel ships from Sijiao to Shanghai, it incited sand and gravel workers, boatmen, and others to strike. The guild yesterday sent letters to the city's Chamber of Commerce and the Settlement authorities, urging them to stop it quickly. It also issued a letter to fellow traders, urging them not to trade with "Wantai." The Fishing Boat Sand Transport Industry Association immediately stopped loading sand and gravel for "Wantai." Striking workers yesterday prevented "Wantai" from barging sand. The details are as follows:

Preventing Unloading: More than twenty sand and gravel ships from Sijiao to Shanghai, belonging to Qiu Wende and others, were detained in Yangshupu by the use of special forces (boatmen and workers unanimously went on strike, opposing the monopoly). Yesterday morning at 10 AM, the striking workers received a report that the sand and gravel loaded on the detained sand ships had been seized by force and hired barges to transport it to the new garbage bridge in the Suzhou River, preparing to unload the cargo. The workers gathered more than two hundred people and rushed to prevent it. As a result, the sand and gravel could not be unloaded and is still docked at the New Garbage Bridge. Although the seized people hired new workers to try to unload the cargo, they ultimately failed due to the prevention of the striking workers. It is reported that the striking workers have strictly organized to prevent the smuggling of sand and gravel and have notified the Sijiao sand and gravel industry to stop loading sand and shipping it to Shanghai.

Sending a Letter Requesting Prevention: The Sand and Gravel Industry Association yesterday sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, the Central Police Station Political Department, the French Concession Public Works Bureau, and the French Police Station Political Department, stating: "According to a joint letter from our members, recently Jin from Sijiao and other local bullies colluded with a certain party to organize 'Wantai Company,' attempting to control the transport of sand and gravel to Shanghai and benefit independently. Such a motive will inevitably wipe out the livelihoods of the people of Sand, the boatmen, and hundreds of our members. The public is indignant and fears that they will take risks and cause trouble. Therefore, we are writing to request your association to provide assistance." After investigation by our association, the facts are true. The transport of sand and gravel to Shanghai is necessary for the construction and repair of roads in the Settlement and is also relied upon by the poor for their livelihoods. Once monopolized, it will inevitably affect people's lives and may cause unexpected risks. Our association is limited by the environment and is unable to do much. In addition to publishing announcements in the newspaper to call on all sectors to stop it, we are specially requesting your 'Association,' 'Bureau,' and 'Department' to uphold justice, provide assistance, and ensure the livelihoods of tens of thousands of poor people. We are confident that we can rely on you. We are sending this letter accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and handle it accordingly.

Stopping Barding: The Shanghai Fishing Boat Sand Transport Industry Association issued a notice yesterday, stating: "For the matter of notification, it has recently been discovered that Jin Zhengfa and other local bullies from Sijiao have contacted the pseudo-organization 'Wantai Sand and Gravel Company' to try to wipe out the industry and monopolize operations, acting as accomplices for tigers and committing extreme illegal acts. They even dare to seize imported sand and gravel by coercive means. Our association, considering the country's sovereignty and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of poor people, hereby announces that all member sailboats under our jurisdiction shall immediately cease loading and shall not be used by others to attract guilt. Please be aware." Furthermore, the Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association has also notified its members to uniformly cease barging sand for "Wantai Company."

### Products Not Controlled by Japanese Forces Should Not Be Regarded as Enemy Goods

Still Allowed to Be Sold Normally in Various Places: The Ministry of Economic Affairs Explains by Order

Whether products from national goods manufacturers in occupied areas should be regarded as Japanese goods has attracted considerable attention from the general public, especially from overseas Chinese, who are carrying out boycotts of goods, and are particularly concerned about this issue. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now issued an order explaining that products from occupied areas that are not utilized or controlled by the Japanese forces should not be regarded as Japanese goods and should still be allowed to be transported and sold in various places, such as products from national goods factories in the Shanghai Concession area.

All are Allowed to Be Sold: The order is recorded as follows: (Above omitted) The Regulations on Prohibiting Enemy Goods were officially promulgated by the National Government on October 27 of last year. The formulation of these regulations stems from the fact that after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the dumping of enemy goods into the interior did not diminish at all, and the enemy used every means to seize and plunder our country's production enterprises in various occupied areas. Once seized, they immediately used their products to sell to our interior, or even lured manufacturers to resume work, and used their violence to carry out centralized control and manipulation, or set up centralized organizations for local products, forcibly buying up and hoarding them, in order to provide them for cheap dumping and absorb our financial resources. This kind of

Economic Aggression Conspiracy is Extremely Pressing: In order to consolidate the foundation of our country's economy and enhance the strength of the War of Resistance, it is necessary to prohibit the products of enemy countries and the products of factories and shops in occupied areas that have been seized, controlled, or utilized by the enemy. As for others who have not been seized, controlled, or utilized by the enemy, such as factories and shops in the Shanghai Concession, many of which are still being operated by Chinese people, and small industrial products and handicrafts in the interior of Shanghai and Hangzhou, although they come from occupied areas, there are not a few among them that have not been subjected to enemy

Control and Utilization, and they should be allowed to be transported and sold and should not be equated with enemy goods. Overseas Chinese compatriots have always been enthusiastic about boycotting enemy goods. Recently, disputes have arisen over the issue of whether goods from occupied areas should be regarded as enemy goods, which has not only hindered the progress of the boycott but also affected the business of legitimate national goods manufacturers in various places. Now that the Regulations on Prohibiting Enemy Goods have been promulgated and implemented, there are clear regulations on the prohibition of enemy goods in occupied areas, which overseas Chinese compatriots can follow to avoid differences.

### Current Situation in Qingdao: Guerrilla Teams Control the Surroundings, No Market Can Be Spoken of on the Entire Island

Qingdao is an important port in Shandong. Previously, Mayor Shen Honglie destroyed all factories and buildings and retreated with the entire division, changing to defend the Jiaoji Railway line. Qingdao was thus occupied by the Japanese army. According to a person who came from there yesterday, the market is now desolate and unbearable. In order to seek recovery, the Japanese forced residents to return to Qingdao, and if they did not, they confiscated their property. The masses had no choice but to return to Qingdao one after another, but there is still no market to speak of. Only the Zhongshan Road area is relatively prosperous, but the surroundings of Qingdao and the Jiaoji Railway line are controlled by guerrilla teams, so the Japanese dare not take a step beyond. The Jiaoji train also runs only one round trip at 8 AM every day, and does not dare to travel at night. In late last month, a section of the track was dismantled by a guerrilla team, causing the train departing from Qingdao on that day to derail completely, with the locomotive and passenger cars overturning. The locomotive carriages were completely damaged, and many passengers were killed or injured. Although the track has been repaired by the Japanese army, travelers are therefore hesitant to travel there, and the Japanese army there is also frightened.

### Sufficient Rice in Shanghai

Market Prices Will Not Rise Sharply

The Shanghai Rice Industry Association's Rice Market at 550 Fuzhou Road has, in accordance with the resolution of the association, closed the market from February 15 to February 26. The amount of goods arriving from the interior has decreased in recent days. As the end of the lunar year approaches, every household is stocking up on grain for the New Year, so the number of rice shops has increased, and the market has been established for this reason. Rice prices have generally increased by forty-five cents per stone. According to the resolution of the association, the handover procedures between brokers and fellow traders will be carried out from February 15 to 16. Currently, various merchants have started settling accounts with various helper merchants since yesterday. The situation of rice in Shanghai this year is better, and the rice industry has generally made a profit, so no unexpected events should occur. The amount of rice stored in the vaults of various silver shops and banks in this city reaches 670,000 to 80,000 bags, totaling 1.3 million dan. Based on the daily consumption of 10,000 stones of rice in Shanghai, this is enough to maintain the city for more than three months, so market prices will not rise sharply.

### Zhejiang Special Business Tax: Changed Collection Method

Changed to Collect Special Consumption Tax and Prescribed Three Tax Rates

The Zhejiang Provincial War Zone Special Business Tax has been resolved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government to be changed to a special consumption tax. A consumption tax will be levied on the transportation and sale of woolen fabrics, silks and satins, foreign cloth, cosmetics, foreign general merchandise, tin foil, etc. in the war zone. The tax rate is prescribed as three types: 1. Woolen fabrics, silks and satins, cosmetics, and artificial silk toys among foreign general merchandise are taxed at 30% of the value. 2. Textiles, rubber, porcelain and pottery materials, candies, canned food, seasonings, aluminum products, and foreign cloth are taxed at 2%. 3. Candles, soap, buttons, and toothbrushes are taxed at 10%.

### Various Industries Handle Final Closing

Financial Stability: The period for the final closing of various industries in the Republic of China in 1938 is approaching in the blink of an eye. The Money Industry held an executive committee meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the final closing and decided to stop paying interest to all customers by the tenth of the month, but overdue interest will still be added. The market interest rate will be open until the seventeenth of the month. In recent days, due to the stability of the market's finances, the interest rate has fallen to 8%. Due to the abnormal development of various industries after the war, the debts owed to various banks have been repaid separately and will be cleared in full before the final closing. The Bean and Rice Industry Market, etc., is scheduled to start its holiday tomorrow to handle the final closing matters. Personnel have been dispatched to collect outstanding customer accounts. For those in other ports, the City Chamber of Commerce or various industry associations will issue certificates, and personnel from various shops will be dispatched to collect them. The Shanghai financial market remains stable, and various interest rates have rarely changed. The four central banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) are able to recover loans on schedule. As of now, the outstanding balance is 15 million yuan, and the borrowers are banks and money houses, all of which have solid collateral. Therefore, there is no problem for various industries to safely pass the New Year.

Profits of Various Industries Last Year: Among the various industries, the yarn factories of the national goods industry performed the best, with each earning at least more than one million yuan in national currency. Next were silk reeling, cotton textiles, knitted goods, and silk fabrics. In general, various factories in the Settlement after the war were able to obtain considerable profits. Furthermore, various used clothing stores, as well as tobacco exchange shops, hotels, restaurants, and various foreign goods shops, had unusually prosperous business and made substantial profits, which has only been seen in the past ten years. The reason for this is the surge in population and the rise in foreign exchange rates. For example, famous clothing stores such as Tiantian and Fuchang earned 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. The wages of shop assistants in this industry were very low on weekdays, but this year, due to the development of business, their extra income has more than doubled, so the prosperity of the used clothing industry was the best in the city last year.

### Raw Material Panic in Shanghai Silk Factories Due to Japanese Puppet Control

Cocoon Prices Soar Above Silk Prices, Chinese Silk Exports Sharply Reduced Due to Japanese Dumping

The export of raw silk from our country has always occupied a major position in foreign trade, and silk reeling is also one of the important domestic industries. Its prosperity and decline are enough to affect the national economy. After the war, the silk factories in the war zone of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were destroyed, and manufacturers refused to cooperate with Japanese merchants. New silk factories were established in the Shanghai Concession to maintain the position of Chinese silk in foreign trade. Now, due to the Japanese control of the silk industry in the occupied area, the source of cocoon prices in Shanghai is lacking, causing panic. The details are as follows:

Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Almost Completely Destroyed: At the most prosperous time, there were 113 silk reeling factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, with 25,307 machines; 48 in Wuxi, with 14,425 machines; 5 in Suzhou, with 808 machines; and 24 in Zhejiang's Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Haining, with 4,800 machines. At the beginning of the August 13th Incident, only two factories, New Lao Yihe, were operating in the Shanghai Public Concession. The remaining factories were affected by the war and forced to completely shut down.

Raw Silk Exports Concentrated in Shanghai: Raw silk production has always been divided into Shanghai and Guangzhou. Exports from Shanghai include white silk and Ji Li silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and yellow silk from Sichuan and Shandong and gray silk from Shandong. Exports from Guangzhou are Cantonese silk. Since Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Guangdong fell one after another, Chinese silk, except for Sichuan silk that was transshipped to Haiphong for export, was completely concentrated in Shanghai for export. Last year's exports were 3,184,460 kilograms, with a value of 33,600,003,686 yuan in national currency, the lowest amount in the past five years.

Raw Material Panic in Shanghai Silk Factories: Silk factories in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang war zones refused to cooperate with the Japanese forces. New silk factories were established in the Shanghai Concession, concentrated in the western part of Shanghai. Among them, Liancheng, Fulong, Jianye, Lianyuan, and 30 other factories have been completed and put into operation. Later, due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the improvement of overseas silk markets, the silk production of various factories in the Concession caused a trend of demand exceeding supply. Each factory obtained substantial profits and opened day and night shifts to rush the silk reeling. However, there was an unprecedented shortage and panic in raw materials (i.e., cocoons).

Cocoon Prices Soar Above Silk Prices: Since last autumn, cocoon production within the war zone has been affected by Japanese puppet control. Factories within the Shanghai Concession cannot purchase from the producing areas. As a result, cocoon prices in the Shanghai market have soared. At present, the price of improved dry cocoons has risen from 200 yuan to 360 yuan per dan, exceeding the price of Chinese silk. For example, the standard for Chinese silk is 1,500 yuan in national currency per dan. If calculated at 400 catties per reeling, it is impossible to make a profit by reeling silk with the current market price of cocoons, and there is a risk of loss. Therefore, the future of various manufacturers in Shanghai is worrying.

### National Government Issues Order Advocating Food Conservation

Prescribes Milling Degree of Rice and Wheat, Restricts Cotton Fields and Encourages Rice Planting

In order to regulate food in various places during the emergency period, the National Government has promulgated specific measures and ordered them to be followed. In addition to encouraging the establishment of agricultural warehouses, managing grain storage, cracking down on manipulation, and prohibiting smuggling, it has also ordered the promotion of food conservation movements, such as prescribing the degree of whitening of rice and the fineness of wheat flour, prohibiting or restricting the use of major food crops for winemaking and other improper consumption. Local governments or food regulation agencies should encourage the people to automatically conserve food. In addition, they should restrict cotton fields and encourage rice planting.

### Youth in Adolescence

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of Russian Labor University Medical School

Reasons for Easily Being Intoxicated by Love

When young people reach adolescence, due to the vigorous secretion of hormones in the adolescent gland, they gradually possess reproductive capabilities. Therefore, they become aware of love and gradually pay attention to the opposite sex, often developing a strong sense of curiosity. This intense pursuit of love towards the opposite sex can hinder the development of both physical and mental abilities, as it drastically depletes these two major capabilities. Consequently, this leads to kidney deficiency, premature aging, and a shortened lifespan.

Some say that young people in adolescence lack worldly experience and do not understand the true meaning of love between men and women. Moreover, their will is weak, making them susceptible to intoxication by the opposite sex and falling into the trap of love. This certainly has some validity. However, those young people who are harmed by licentiousness or masturbation experience physical decline and premature aging due to a moment of indiscretion, which they later regret!

Therefore, during adolescence, we should absolutely maintain chastity and protect our adolescent gland, ensuring healthy development throughout the body. The adolescent gland is one of the most important glands in the human body. Adolescence is characterized by the vigor of the adolescent gland, which initiates the production of semen, serving the purpose of reproduction. Modern medicine has proven that premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, incomplete development, mental weakness, impotence, and infertility are all caused by excessive indulgence during adolescence.

Now that it is clear that the health of the brain and kidneys depends on the prosperity of the adolescent gland, medical science in various countries utilizes scientific methods to extract hormones from the adolescent glands of vigorous animals to supplement the human body. For example, "Vitacamp," a testicular essence preparation from vigorous animals invented by Dr. Mellen of Germany, is indeed a great invention of modern medicine. After taking it, mental clarity is improved, spirits are invigorated, complexion becomes ruddy, appetite increases, and sexual function is greatly enhanced, with no symptoms of kidney deficiency or impotence. It can also promote reproductive function, aid in the development of sexual organs, and restore sexual potency in middle-aged individuals. It has remarkable efficacy in nourishing the brain, kidneys, and blood. Therefore, I always use this preparation when treating the above-mentioned conditions and have never encountered a case of failure. As for women with irregular periods, prolonged infertility, sallow complexion, and premature ejaculation, they can take "Vitacamp" for women to invigorate their adolescent gland function, leading to complete recovery and significant results in breast development!

### The Harmful Consequences of Habitual Masturbation

— Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany

In the past, the harmful effects of masturbation were not well understood, leading to conflicting opinions. Some even claimed that it had no major harmful effects. However, with the advancement of medicine, it has been proven that most cases of neurasthenia, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, and other conditions are caused by excessive indulgence in masturbation.

Why does masturbation lead to the aforementioned diseases? The reason is quite obvious. Masturbation can make the erection nerves and ejaculation center hypersensitive, leading to unconscious seminal emission during sleep and at other times. As the frequency gradually increases, the essence and blood are depleted, and the metabolic function gradually slows down. As a result, the brain nerves, sexual nerves, and spinal cord are severely damaged, leading to various symptoms of weakness. At this time, patients should not deceive themselves but must abstain from masturbation and seek effective treatment. According to the most reliable treatment, taking "Nersal Antigonorrhea Pills" can stop it. This pill also has the effect of calming the brain and is very effective for those suffering from insomnia and forgetfulness. If masturbation has already caused neurasthenia and sexual dysfunction, taking the German "Vitacamp" concurrently can be very effective.

Modern Medicine

### A Discussion on Experimental Gonorrhea Treatment

— Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States

…Failure is the mother of success, so worry no more about gonorrhea.

…This is completely different from the general transdermal sterilization method!

I have repeatedly written about whether gonorrhea can be cured and when it can be cured. As an internist, I find that the number of patients seeking treatment for gonorrhea exceeds that of other illnesses. With over a hundred patients daily, I have experienced both success and failure in treatment. I would like to share my daily experiences for the reference of patients, which I believe will be welcomed by those suffering from gonorrhea.

I have used many medications for the treatment of gonorrhea, none of which have had particularly outstanding effects. However, the transdermal sterilization method had very little effect. Therefore, I decided to stop using oral medications and instead adopted electrocautery and various surgical treatments. Surgery was complicated, time-consuming, and yielded limited results. The waiting patients were impatient and frequently urged me, which made me increasingly anxious. Previously, Dr. Chen informed me that the "German Koling Medical Journal" contained information on the efficacy of the drug "Clenagon." Renowned scholars from various countries unanimously praised it as a major success in treating gonorrhea. I was already familiar with "Clenagon" in the United States, but since I did not have the drug upon returning to China, I was unable to use it immediately. Upon hearing Dr. Chen's words, I gladly adopted it and unexpectedly achieved remarkable results. It turns out that the miraculous efficacy of "Clenagon" is not accidental. The inventor of this preparation, Dr. Peter, a German gonorrhea specialist, used a mixture of protein body and yellow pigment. Because it has great bactericidal power, it has a remarkable anti-inflammatory effect. All acute gonorrhea complications, sequelae, persistent gonorrhea, morning closure of the urethra, as well as epididymitis, prostatitis, and cystitis, are mostly cured in about three to four weeks. Therefore, patients flocked to seek treatment, and I often prescribed this drug. Regardless of gender, taking it can be effective. It saves the trouble of many surgeries and allows patients to enjoy self-treatment. Therefore, after the invention of "Clenagon," the number of gonorrhea sufferers has greatly decreased. It is no wonder that this drug has spread like wildfire throughout the world and is a beacon of hope in the murky sea.

### Gonorrhea Lecture

— Stated by Physician Yao Juyuan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

Why are Gonococci Active in Spring?

The relationship between seasons and bacteria is extremely significant. Therefore, many seasonal diseases are prevalent during their respective seasons, while they are rarely seen in other seasons. This is largely due to the effectiveness of climatic activity. Now, let's discuss the activity of gonococci. The transmission of gonorrhea is not limited to climate and seasons. However, it cannot be said that the activity of gonococci is unrelated to the climate. When spring returns to the earth and all things flourish, we are also more active in our actions compared to the cold winter. Therefore, the dormant gonococci inevitably take the opportunity to move and wreak havoc. This is why many uncured chronic gonorrhea cases often relapse in spring. Another reason for the spread of gonorrhea is that we are more inclined towards romance in spring than in other seasons. Therefore, it is also a major cause of gonorrhea transmission.

The Opportunity for Easy Recovery However, we should also turn the discussion around. The season when gonococci are most active is also the season when gonorrhea is easiest to treat. This is because at this time, the dormant gonococci are eager to move and have a tendency to attack en masse. Therefore, it is best to seize the opportunity to eradicate them completely. Based on my experience, the best drug to use is the gonorrhea panacea "Clenagon." This is because "Clenagon" has a thorough bactericidal effect. Furthermore, the German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy are used in conjunction, resulting in the rapid eradication of latent gonococci. Therefore, the spring season is the best opportunity to eliminate gonorrhea. Please do not miss this opportunity. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty patients will be seen daily, and each patient will only be charged five jiao.

### Hemoptysis Should Be Cured Quickly

— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

Regarding hemoptysis caused by tuberculosis, due to the fragility of blood vessels in the affected area, exercise and coughing can suddenly cause the rupture of blood vessels, resulting in hemoptysis. Tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and all changes in the disease progress very slowly. However, hemoptysis is a sudden occurrence and requires effective treatment and should not be neglected. In terms of theory and experience, hemoptysis is not necessarily a critical condition. However, it should not be regarded as a minor symptom either. Based on my years of experience, "Pulmo-tol" is the most effective oral medication, which can not only cure hemoptysis but also eradicate the root cause of hemoptysis. The reason why I say that hemoptysis from lung disease is not to be feared is because of this. "Pulmo-tol" has the miraculous effect of killing tuberculosis bacilli, making it the most effective oral medication for lung disease and hemoptysis.

### Local Catholic Community Sends Condolences to the Roman Pope

Masses to be Held in Churches Tomorrow

Following the passing of Pope Pius XI in Rome, the world has expressed sorrow, and the Catholic community in Shanghai is deeply saddened. During his reign, the Pope showed great care for China, first by consecrating Chinese bishops and strongly supporting charitable, educational, and missionary endeavors. His promotion of the Catholic Action movement earned him the title of "Chinese Pope." Bishop Huai Jiliang of the Shanghai Diocese will hold a memorial Mass and will invite people from all walks of life to attend. The Catholic Action Association, represented by Zhu Zhiyao and Lu Yingen, sent a telegram to Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State of the Vatican, Cardinal Biondi, the Prefect of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, and Archbishop Gang Hengyi, the Secretary-General, expressing deep condolences. Yesterday, the association also convened a meeting of its members. During the meeting, all members observed a moment of silence to express their grief and decided to offer a memorial Mass on the morning of February 15th, praying that God would grant him ascension to heaven.

According to the French Shanghai Daily News on February 12th, it is reported that Catholic churches in Shanghai will hold Masses on February 14th in memory of Pope Pius XI. It is also reported that Bishop Huai Jiliang of the Shanghai Catholic Diocese will hold a grand Mass at 10:00 AM on February 16th at the Church of the Sacred Heart on Catholic Church Street in the French Concession to commemorate Pope Pius XI.

### Foreigners in Kuling to be Evacuated to Jiujiang

Escorted by British and American Sailors

Regarding the evacuation of foreigners from Kuling, after a meeting in Jiujiang, the British and American naval authorities decided to send sailors to Kuling to protect the foreigners and escort them to Jiujiang. However, the evacuation date has not yet been determined.

According to the Continental Daily News, as of last night (February 11th), the fate of the 37 foreigners in Kuling was still undecided. Several Japanese naval officers are waiting for the weather to clear so they can go to Jiujiang to directly investigate the situation. As soon as the weather permits, they will fly to Jiujiang to contact British and American officials there. Sources claim that the evacuation of foreigners from Kuling cannot be implemented because there is no

concrete plan. This may be because the British and American sides are trying to delay the issue in order to reach an understanding, or because the current Japanese authorities in Jiujiang have no authority or desire to implement any established plan. In view of the uncertain situation, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai sent several naval staff officers to Jiujiang on Friday to investigate, but they did not depart due to

unfavorable weather. However, the Japanese side declared at a reception for reporters last night that the group of Japanese naval officers will depart from Shanghai for Jiujiang as soon as possible. After their arrival, they are expected to consult with British and American officials and contact the foreigners in Kuling to arrange for those who wish to evacuate the mountain to do so. According to the latest news received last night, the British and American authorities in Jiujiang and Shanghai have been unable to

establish contact but are still hoping that those who have received the broadcast from a local radio station in Shanghai on Friday night will try to report to Jiujiang. It is reported that the American warship Wachusett, which is currently docked in Jiujiang, clearly received the broadcast. Therefore, it is assumed that at least one person in Kuling may have also received it. Previously, it was felt that it was difficult to communicate with Kuling through Jiujiang. Foreign naval authorities are currently trying to contact the Chinese army around Kuling through Chongqing.

### The Pudong Guerrilla Force in the Past Year

— Ying

(1) The Growth of the Pudong Guerrilla Force;

(2) The Development and Current Situation of the Pudong Guerrilla Force;

(3) What Work Has Been Done in This Past Year;

(4) Lessons Learned;

The sacred Chinese War of Resistance to win freedom, independence, and liberation for the people finally broke out on July 7th of the year before last. It has continued for one year and nine months. This has not only shattered the enemy's dream of a quick victory and conquest of China but has also given the world a new understanding of the Chinese nation. It is true that in this year and nine months of fighting, China has lost vast lands and abundant resources. The Chinese people have suffered unprecedented massacres and catastrophes in history. But on the other hand, obviously, there has been accelerated progress in all aspects of China, showing a brand-new attitude. The improvement of the army's combat power, the improvement of political institutions, and the strengthening of national consciousness are all undeniable facts. And the most important thing is the development of guerrilla warfare in enemy-occupied areas. Because these guerrillas lurking behind enemy lines are the vanguard of the future full-scale counter-offensive and the guarantee of ultimate victory. It is now when the war is about to enter the second stage. Developing guerrilla warfare is undoubtedly the most urgent task at present. The Pudong guerrilla force has gradually become active under this major premise.

(1) The Growth of the Pudong Guerrilla Force

Due to its geographical location, Pudong has less military value. However, due to its abundant resources and large population, it is an important supply base for food and military supplies for the front lines during wartime. After the August 13th Shanghai Incident, the central government ordered General Zhang Fakui's troops to be stationed there. The famous Pudong artillery positions played a superior technology and great power, giving the enemy a major blow, creating a glorious page in the history of the Songhu War of Resistance. When the war first broke out, the central government sent special commissioners to various places to organize special operations teams, which were directly under the Military Affairs Commission. They strictly trained the original militia teams in various places separately. But soon, the enemy troops landed from Jinshanwei, and Shanghai was lost. A large number of national troops from various places flowed into Pudong because they failed to retreat with the army in time. Therefore, together with the militia teams and special operations teams from various places, they successively organized troops to maintain the chaotic order at the time. This was the initial establishment of the Pudong guerrilla force and also the foundation of the current guerrilla force.

(2) The Development and Current Situation of the Pudong Jinan Team

When various troops were first established, the components were quite complex, the quality varied, and the discipline was very uneven. There were indeed guerrilla forces organized by intellectuals and regular army soldiers, but there were also many teams gathered by local ruffians and gangsters. With one or two hundred team members and firearms, they could call themselves border defense commanders or ×× county magistrates. Moreover, each one acted on their own, without contact with each other, and the names were also different. However, most of them used the old name "Special Operations Team." At that time, very few were resisting Japan for the people. Most of them took advantage of the chaos in the local area to seek personal gain. Therefore, the discipline was extremely bad. Robbery, theft, and confiscation of firearms from the people were rampant. The general public feared them like tigers, calling these teams "Special Lords." At that time, there was a team whose commander was named Liu ××. One night, he forcibly collected tens of thousands of military salaries from various towns. The dark situation can be seen. Moreover, between the various teams, conflicts often arose due to the pursuit of interests, and they attacked each other, which was called "Special Eats Special." Precious ammunition and countless financial resources were wasted. At this time, the enemy troops in Pudong had already occupied the towns along the Shangchuan and Shangnan railways, established the "Avenue Municipal Government" in Dongchang Road, and established puppet regimes and pacification teams in various towns. They carried out strict household registration, openly sold drugs, and established brothels to numb the general public. Moreover, they established schools in various places, implemented enslaved education, and promoted the Way of the King. These gave a great warning to the general teams. Last spring, the Japanese army on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was transferred north, and they conveniently conducted a "sweep" in Pudong for a week, trying to "eliminate" these teams. All towns in Pudong were visited by Japanese soldiers. They committed rape, robbery, arson of houses, and did everything they could. Fortunately, the entire army withdrew north after a few days. After this, they could not help but cause each team to think more about their relationship with each other, and the result was that they had to tend to reduce internal strife and stop attacking each other in order to unite the forces of all units and fight against the common enemy. So under the slogan "We are all Chinese," they cooperated, joined hands, and worked hard to unite the army and the people, winning the sympathy and help of the people of Pudong. At this point, the Pudong guerrilla force began to move towards a bright future. Discipline improved day by day, the army and the people gradually integrated, the team members were strictly trained, and more attention was paid to political training, preparing to fight for the country and the nation. Afterwards, the central government sent special commissioners to Pudong to reorganize and unify the name to "Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army," which was directly under the Military Affairs Commission's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee and commanded by the Third War Zone. This formed the current strong Pudong guerrilla force, which posed a major threat to the Japanese army in the suburbs of Shanghai. What is said above is the general situation of the Pudong guerrilla force from its birth to the present.

As for the current Pudong Jinan guerrillas, there are roughly the following types: The Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army under the leadership of special commissioners; The security regiments and police bureaus established by various counties; The People's Self-Defense Forces organized by the coastal people. The factions are extremely complex, but they are increasingly unified and increasingly sound. Among them, the most important and strongest force is of course the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army, which has a total of four or five detachments. Its organization is a three-three system. One detachment governs three battalions; one battalion has three companies; one company is divided into three squads; and one squad has three teams. The number of people in each detachment ranges from several hundred to several thousand. The current general distribution is: Ding Xishan's first detachment is stationed in Nanqiao, Xiaotang, Yexie, Tinglin, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway area in Fengxian; there are also traces of its troops in Xiasa, Hangtou, Lujiahui, and other places in Nanhui. With a large number of subordinates and sufficient military fire, its strength is extremely strong, and its power has recently expanded to the Pudong area. It also has a large number of intellectuals and is a leader in the Pudong guerrilla force. Yu Taosheng's detachment stayed in Nanhui County. His subordinate Gu Shouxin's troops are stationed in Xinchang Town; Li Wenyuan's troops are stationed in Sandun Town; Yan Zeng's troops are stationed in Datuan Town. Many of the soldiers are regular troops left behind, and the discipline is the strictest of all the teams in Pudong. They have fought many times and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Therefore, the enemy tried to use political means to induce them, but the result failed. Li Zhiming's detachment is stationed in Fengxian County and Zhoujialong and other places. The combat power is also superior. Chuansha County is defended by Zhang Huifang's troops. The equipment is the most sophisticated, and there are naval units. The strength is quite sufficient. As for the coastal areas, the People's Self-Defense Force organized by Gu Lifeng, Mao Guanyan, and others is responsible for the defense. The organization is similar to the New Fourth Army, and the soldiers and weapons are both well-equipped. Looking at the current Pudong guerrilla force as a whole, there are tens of thousands of people, and they are gradually progressing and unifying. In the future, it will not be difficult to become a strong iron army that will drive the enemy out of the country.

### New French Consul Renault to Take Office in Hankou

Mr. Renault Has a Deep Understanding of China and Rich Experience in Negotiations with Japan

According to the French Shanghai Daily News on February 12th, the newly appointed French Consul in Hankou, Renault, is scheduled to travel to Hankou by Japanese naval aircraft this morning (February 12th) to take office. As for the former French Consul in Hankou, Gao Lin, he has been transferred to another position. The brief history of Consul Renault is similar to that of other French consuls, who have served as consuls in various places in China for a long time. However, Mr. Renault's

understanding of China is probably deeper than that of other consuls. When Renault first decided to come to China, he was ordered to participate in the construction of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Therefore, he traveled extensively between Indochina and Sichuan and was very familiar with the journey from the Lancang River to the Yangtze River. Because inland

transportation was inconvenient at the time, it was necessary to travel by horse or sedan chair, so he witnessed many of the customs of China. From the first time Renault came to China until 1906, he began to work for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was assigned as a translator at the French Consulate in Shanghai. Then he was transferred to Fuzhou. Before long, he returned to France from Fujian to get married, which was in 1910. During the European War in 1914, Renault participated in the war as a reserve officer, but he was soon captured by the Germans.

He was imprisoned for four years before being released and ordered to return to Shanghai, where he served as the chief judge of the Mixed Court. Later, in 1920, he was transferred to Hong Kong as consul, in 1921, he was transferred to Beihai as consul, and in 1923, he was transferred to Harbin as consul. Now he is transferred to Hankou as French Consul. When Renault was in Harbin, he was in charge of the establishment of "Manchukuo" and had many negotiations with Japan, gaining considerable experience. Therefore, the French government transferred him to Hankou as consul, so his diplomacy with Japan is already familiar and he will be able to handle the work.

### Relief for Refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi: Donations Have Been Continuously Remitted

Over 70,000 Yuan Remitted Successively / Fundraising Through Performances Yields Excellent Results

According to reports from various donation collection agencies, the Guangdong Native Place Association in Shanghai's fundraising committee for refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi has received over 80,000 yuan in legal tender. The association has successively remitted funds through the Taihe Xing Bank, Guangdong Bank, and East Asia Bank to its representatives in Hong Kong, including three committee members such as Lin Bingyan, totaling 40,000 Hong Kong dollars.

This converts to over 73,000 yuan in legal tender, designated for distribution to the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, the Red Cross Society in Shaoguan, the Guangzhou Chengxi Charitable Hospital, and charitable organizations in Guangxi, for the purpose of providing relief to refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi. The association has set February 15th as the deadline for the first round of fundraising performance reports. It hopes that those who have not yet donated will actively contribute, and those who have pledged donations but have not yet paid will do so as soon as possible to the various donation collection points. If it is too late to do so but they wish to be listed in the initial announcement, they can notify the association's office in writing through the fundraising committee members of each group for inclusion in the list. Otherwise, their donations will be included in the next report according to the order of receipt. Additionally, the Guangdong Native Place Association in Shanghai is currently inviting Ms. Wei Li Xuefang and the Taishan Cantonese Opera Troupe to perform at the New Stage.

Half of the proceeds from the performances will be given to the association to help disaster victims in Guangdong and Guangxi, while the other half will be allocated to the Shanghai Refugee Association for refugee relief. The association hopes that people from all walks of life will purchase tickets and support this charitable cause. The fundraising performance began on the night before last. First, the deputy director of the association, Guo Shun,

delivered an opening speech, thanking the guests for their enthusiasm in helping refugees. Director Feng Bingnan was unable to attend due to other commitments, so a written speech was delivered on his behalf by Jiang Hechun. Liang Weisi and Cui Pinxi then reported on the preparatory process and donation situation. The theatrical performances then began, featuring three famous plays. "Breaking Through the Copper Pass on an Icy Night" was a masterpiece by Liang Yintang and Hua Lisi. "Who is the Princess Huang?" was performed by Gui Mingyang and Wen Huamei, who complemented each other perfectly. The finale was "Shilin's Sacrifice at the Pagoda," a signature masterpiece by Mrs. Wei Li Xuefang, who played the role of Bai Shi herself. Although she has been away from the stage for a long time, her voice was as clear and melodious as ever, and her expressions were as nuanced as in her prime. Luo Jiaquan played the role of Shilin, and his singing and acting were both extraordinary, truly fitting the character perfectly. Furthermore, six famous Cantonese music masters, Shang Huating, Guo Qian, Peng Guoqi, Chen Guanqian, Huang Bentang, and Ouyang Zhang, joined in the accompaniment, further enhancing the performance. As a result, the theater was packed that night. It is said that requests and letters asking for a repeat performance of "Shilin's Sacrifice at the Pagoda" have been pouring in. The association is considering inviting Mrs. Wei Li Xuefang to perform the play again on the 14th to satisfy the audience's enthusiasm and to benefit refugees in Shanghai, Guangdong, and Guangxi.

### Monument to Fallen Soldiers in the War of Resistance

Central Government Orders Universal Establishment in All Provinces / Establishes Completion Date and Urges Expedited Construction

Following the Central Party Headquarters' order on the anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction on the Double Seventh Festival last year, instructing party headquarters in all provinces to universally establish monuments to fallen soldiers in the War of Resistance in various locations throughout the provinces, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters has found that although the construction of these monuments is underway in various counties, few have been completed after half a year. To ensure their early completion for public admiration, local party headquarters should cooperate with relevant local parties to expedite the process, agree on a completion date, and oversee the construction. The progress should be reported for record. In addition to sending letters to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Committee, orders have been issued to county party headquarters to act accordingly.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Music Band Budget for This Year

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Music Band Committee met on the 27th of last month to pass the music band's budget for this year and resolved to express gratitude to the committee's affairs sub-committee. According to the budget, the band's expenses for this year total 186,450 yuan, an increase of 2,000 yuan compared to last year's budget. This includes a temporary allowance of 17,510 yuan for Western staff and 5,510 yuan for Chinese musicians' salaries, which are new expenses for this year. The subsidy from the Italian government is designated for this purpose, and the amount is appropriate. Another newly listed expense is 2,800 yuan for various expenses related to outdoor concerts (these expenses were previously listed in the park budget). In the future, the income from outdoor concerts will belong to the music band, and the income and expenses can be offset. The subsidy of 20,000 yuan promised by the French Concession Public Works Bureau has been included in the budget. After discussing the above budget, the members of the Music Band Committee unanimously agreed to submit it to the Finance Committee for review, but the Chief of Finance and the Music Director may jointly negotiate changes.

### The Alexander Ship Robbed and Hijacked for the Second Time

Ordered to Tow a Boat of Stolen Goods to Yanglinkou

Only a Telescope Was Stolen, No Shots Fired and No One Injured

According to the Zi Lin News, the Alexander ship of the Jardine Matheson Company was fired upon by bandits on Friday (the 11th), causing a sailboat to sink. Yesterday morning (the 11th), it was robbed by the same gang. The ship only returned to Shanghai at the No. 2 buoy of the Bund yesterday afternoon, six hours later than scheduled. According to the ship's captain, Yin Shu, he told reporters that at 7 a.m. yesterday,

about 20 fully armed pirates suddenly boarded the ship. Fortunately, there were no passengers on board at the time. The pirates held automatic pistols to his chest, ordering him to tow a Ningbo sailboat full of stolen goods to Yanglinkou. The pirates did not fire a shot. Aside from the radio operator's watch and meat worth 20 yuan, nothing else was stolen. Yin Shu recounted

the details of the two robberies. On Friday night, the Alexander ship docked at Xingang overnight. The next morning, pirates boarded the ship and forced them to tow the ships they had robbed to their destination. The pirates told the ship's driver to tell him that if he didn't agree to their demands, they would harm him. They also said that on Friday morning, they didn't want to harm the Alexander ship or disturb the crew and passengers, only

craving the tugboat. By 3 p.m., the pirates left the ship, but before leaving, they stole the ship's telescope. The pirates seemed to be quite experienced, because when they boarded the ship in Xingang, they took away several parts of the radio equipment and the batteries. He asked them to return the most important parts of the radio equipment they had taken. But the radio was already damaged during the first

attack. The reason is unknown. When the reporter asked if the radio room had been damaged by gunfire, Yin said that after investigation, it had not been damaged by gunfire at all. When he encountered pirates and opened fire on Friday morning, he realized that the radio was damaged when he tried to send a radio message to Shanghai for help. At around 10 a.m. that morning, the radio operator

managed to send a message to the shipowner, reporting the details of the robbery that occurred a few hours earlier, but it suddenly broke down before the message was completed. Before this, at around 8 a.m. that morning, the British warship Jiaohao approached the Alexander ship, presumably after receiving a message from the German ship Luan. Five injured passengers on board were

carried onto the Luan at 7:40 a.m. that morning and taken to Shanghai. An officer from the Jiaohao warship

boarded the ship to inquire. Yin praised the respect and adherence of the Chinese crew on board. He also said that there were rumors that some passengers jumped into the river when the pirates approached, but this was nonsense. He was busy taking care of the injured and had no time to ask the crew about this, but he believed that if it had happened, they would have told him. After inspection, the Alexander ship learned that most of the bullets

hit the bridge. The pirates' weapons must have been very powerful, because one bullet pierced a wooden door and then went through the window and into the ceiling. Yin Shu also told reporters that the Alexander ship was towing a tugboat. Of the six people on board, one had been killed and the remaining five had boarded the Portuguese ship He Weimali and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. However, the

rope tied to the stern suddenly broke, so the ship is now missing and has not been found yet. As of late last night, it was still unclear where the five people rescued by the ship were. It was also learned that when the pirates boarded the Alexander ship yesterday morning, the ship's comprador was afraid that the pirates would steal the money he was guarding, so he hid it in the captain's cabin. When the pirates saw it, they asked him who he was. The comprador pretended to be the captain's servant, and the pirates did not disturb him.

### Possessing a Wife and Taking a Concubine Leads to Disputes

An Agreement Had Just Been Established, but Disputes Arose Again

The Wife Accuses Her Husband and Concubine of Adultery

Zhu Xiansheng, a local resident of No. 150, Lane 90, MacGregor Road, West Shanghai, has one wife and one concubine. The concubine, Zhu, has been his concubine for several years and is currently living with him in Zhejiang. His wife, Yao, lives elsewhere with her daughter. Because of their separate lives, there had been no jealousy in the past. Recently, with more contact, the situation deteriorated, and there were several quarrels. After several reconciliations by relatives and friends, an

agreement was reached in a room at the Tianran Hotel on the 27th of last month. The agreement stipulated that Zhu Xiansheng would pay Yao 10 yuan per month. The day after signing, Yao took her eight-year-old daughter to live with him. Unexpectedly, disputes arose soon after. She could not tolerate it and reported to the relevant police station that her husband, Zhu Xiansheng, and Zhu had committed adultery, requesting an investigation in accordance with the law. The head of the police sent investigators to investigate and found that the man and woman had been cohabiting for five years. They filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Court,

and Judge Meng Tingke opened the court on the 11th to investigate the case after subpoenaing both parties. According to the plaintiff, Zhu Yao, she was beaten and driven away after living with the defendant for only two days. The defendant, Zhu, claimed that during dinner that evening, her husband was discussing family matters, saying that his eldest daughter was thirteen years old and born in the Year of the Tiger, and that the one-year-old child was also born in the Year of the Tiger. The plaintiff then said that her husband was thinking of relying on this thirteen-year-old daughter, and they both got drunk, so they quarreled with each other, and nothing else happened. Zhu Xiansheng's statement was similar to that of his concubine. The court then ordered Zhu Yao to submit the document written at the hotel and adjourned the hearing.

### Dinghai Native Place Association Will Ask Shanghai and Dinghai to Resume Navigation

The Dinghai Native Place Association in Shanghai recently plans to transport relief rice and coffins of fellow villagers to Dinghai. However, Shanghai and Dinghai are currently under navigation restrictions, which has caused concern among some gentlemen and people from Dinghai living in Shanghai. Therefore, they are currently planning to send a telegram or send representatives to the relevant authorities in Ningbo and Zhejiang to request a solution to approve the operation of a few special ships.

### Taoist Priests Performing Rituals at Midnight / Police Officers Attempt to Stop Them and Are Beaten

Disturbing the Peace at Midnight and Violating Curfew / Police Officers Attempt to Stop Them and Are Beaten / The Taoist Priests Are Detained Separately

Jin Youxuan, a Taoist priest from Shaoxing who presides over the Taiyi Taoist Temple on Beishan West Road, performed a New Year's sacrifice after 12 o'clock the night before. In addition to setting up an incense table and offering sacrifices in the temple, he also ordered the Taoist priests to sit on both sides of the temple, playing drums and gongs. The noise reached the neighbors. Officer No. 903 was patrolling the area and ordered everyone to stop because it was past midnight and they should be resting in accordance with the curfew. However, the Taoist priests refused to comply and abandoned their instruments to

engage in a full-scale brawl. Although Officer No. 1532 was patrolling the area, he was also unable to disperse them. It was not until a large automobile from the police force, which patrolled every night to check for curfew violators, arrived that Jin and Ma Zhongbao, Jin Yunheng, Wei Wenzheng, Chen Amao, Hu Ayin, Fan Caixiang, and others who participated in the fight were taken to the police station. According to Officer No. 903's report, Jin Youxuan ordered Ma Zhongbao to lead the crowd in attacking him, dragging him from the road

into the Taoist temple and beating him with fists and feet. Jin even held a kitchen knife and tried to stab him in the head, which he blocked with his arm, but his chest was bruised. When the police chief questioned Jin Youxuan, he claimed that he had complied with the order to stop playing music and was burning ingot paper in the temple because he had to send off the gods. The officer chased him into the temple and overturned the incense table. The items offered were scattered all over the ground. It is a custom in Shaoxing to place a new kitchen knife in the offering plate, and he did not admit to trying to harm anyone with the knife or

ordering the crowd to beat the officer. He also claimed that his head had been broken by the officer. The police chief sent the officer and Jin Youxuan to the hospital for treatment. He also went to the Taiyi Taoist Temple to find the remaining items on the ground, and the kitchen knife was also recovered. The police station sent Jin and the other seven to the First Special District Court yesterday. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution against Jin and others, stating the facts of the case and asking to punish each defendant for

obstructing official duties and causing injury. Judge Meng Tingke then questioned the plaintiff officer and each defendant one by one. The defendants' lawyers, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, defended them. The court immediately sentenced Jin Youxuan and Ma Zhongshi to 50 days of detention each, and the other five to 15 days of detention each. They could commute the sentence by paying a fine of two yuan per day. The kitchen knife was confiscated.

### Grass Paper Merchant Rents a House and Is Defrauded

Defendant Found Not Guilty

Civil Lawsuit Also Dismissed

Tao Shanjia, a Shanghai resident of No. 18, Tongle Fang, Yu Garden Road, West Shanghai, (a shareholder of the Chengyu Paper Company, which operates a paper business), and Shu Chunhe, a Ningbo native who runs a cigarette paper shop, were recently sued in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court by Yu Xinfu, a Fuyang native who operates a grass paper business, who retained a lawyer

to jointly sue them for fraudulently obtaining property, requesting an investigation in accordance with the law, and attaching a civil lawsuit to recover the defrauded money. It is alleged that the plaintiff operates a grass paper business in Shanghai and is familiar with the defendants. On December 23rd of last year, the defendants claimed that there were three houses at the intersection of Madison Road and invited the plaintiff to rent them. At that time, they agreed on a monthly rent of 600 yuan and paid a deposit of 100 yuan and a small rent of 100 yuan. The plaintiff was preparing to move into the new house after selling his original

warehouse when, on December 26th, a lawyer named Guo suddenly sent a letter stating that the house had been forfeited for more than ten days and the deposit would be confiscated. The letter made no mention of the small rent. The time between the plaintiff renting the house and paying the deposit and small rent and receiving the letter from Lawyer Guo was only three or four days, which shows that the defendant

deliberately designed to defraud him, which constitutes a crime under Article 339 of the Criminal Law. He requested an investigation and the recovery of the defrauded money. According to the lawsuit, the court held several hearings and summonses, but the defendants did not appear, and the court ordered them to wait for the defendants to be detained before the hearing. Later, because the defendants could not be arrested, the court held a hearing again a few days ago. Both defendants, accompanied by their lawyer Qian Yuzhong, appeared in court to await questioning. First, the plaintiff and

the lawyer representing him stated the purpose of the prosecution. The defendants' lawyer then stated that the case was purely a civil dispute over renting a house and that it was inappropriate for the plaintiff to bring a criminal lawsuit. He also provided various facts to prove that the defendants had no criminal responsibility. After the court questioned both parties in detail, it declared the case closed. Tao Shanjia and Shu Chunhe were found not guilty in the judgment issued the day before yesterday, and the attached civil lawsuit was dismissed. Zhu Xinliang, a Zhenjiang native living in Yangjiadu, Pudong, joined the guerrillas after the "August 13" Shanghai war and worked as a secret agent. At 3 p.m. on December 2nd of last year, he disguised himself as a peddler and fired a gun at Wang Yongkui, the head of the intelligence department of the puppet "Municipal Government," near the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hart Road (Wang once worked as a Chinese detective in the French Concession police station in 1924 and was appointed as the head of the puppet intelligence department through the introduction of the puppet Su Xiwu). He was arrested by the Public Concession police station and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Zhu Xinliang was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for attempted murder and recidivism. Zhu refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court.

Selling Turpentine / Accused of Receiving Stolen Goods / Whether They Are Stolen Goods Still Needs to Be Investigated and Handled

Chen Xueyin, who buys and sells old goods, recently bought 53 barrels of turpentine from the Japanese in the northern district, which has been referred to as a military occupation, for 30 yuan in legal tender per barrel. He then sold them to Zhu Yinsheng for 32 yuan a barrel. Zhu then resold them to Xie A'gen for 36 yuan a barrel. Although Xie hired Zhou Xingchang and Qian Awu to sell them, promising them a commission of one yuan per barrel, they were unable to find a buyer for a long time. So, they asked Pan Ruifu to introduce them to Qian Xiangsheng's house to store the goods, waiting for a good price to sell. At that time, the Furun Oil Company, which was founded by a foreign merchant, reported the theft of a large amount of turpentine to the police station, requesting an investigation. After the Xinza police station detectives learned that Qian's family had stored this kind of goods, they inquired about them, but their origin was unknown. So, they arrested all of the above people. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the police station, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing them of receiving stolen goods. The case was heard by Judge Meng on the 11th. Xie, Zhou, Pan, and Qian Awu all hired Fan Gang and Yu Enliang as lawyers to defend them, arguing that they were not receiving stolen goods. The other three defendants, Chen, Zhu, and Qian Xiangsheng, also claimed that they were normal transactions. The court then ordered the defendants to be released on bail pending a future judgment. The stolen goods were temporarily stored in the police station for investigation.

### Sold Pharmacy Involved in Litigation

Jiang Dan, who has been a military doctor in the military, was recently sued for breach of trust by Lin Xiuhao (30 years old, a Western doctor), a Fujian native living at No. 11, Paris New Village, Luban Road, French Concession, who retained lawyer Ai Zhenlin, requesting an investigation in accordance with the law, etc. The court approved the motion and opened a court hearing on the matter the day before yesterday by Judge Miao. According to the lawyer representing the plaintiff, the plaintiff and his friend invested in a pharmacy near Avenue Joffre, with a total price of 60,000 yuan. In addition to paying 20,000 yuan first, the remaining amount was to be paid on time. Because the plaintiff is a doctor, according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's order, doctors cannot invest in pharmacies. Therefore, the defendant was entrusted to take over the pharmacy. The plaintiff and the defendant have a teacher-student relationship, so they trusted the entrusted agency. Unexpectedly, without the plaintiff's consent, the defendant returned the store to the seller. This kind of behavior shows that the defendant is guilty of breach of trust and requests that the defendant be investigated and dealt with in accordance with the law. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend him. After the court examined the facts of the case, it ordered the defendant to post bail and adjourned the hearing to the 17th.

### Landlord Extorts Tips / Accused of Fraud

Defendant Knows He Cannot Escape Responsibility

Judge Orders Bail of 1,000 Yuan

The Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court of Shanghai recently opened a trial for a fraud case in which a landlord extorted money. The plaintiff, Cheng Tieyin, who owns a photo studio, accused the landlord, Yang Qingbao, of fraud. According to Cheng, in October 1938, he rented a city house from the defendant on Gordon Road. After both parties agreed on the terms, he paid a deposit of 1,500 yuan. Cheng then sent workers to repair and decorate the house. Unexpectedly, at this time, the defendant suddenly demanded a tip of 1,800 yuan from Cheng. After Cheng refused, Yang Qingbao led a crowd to act barbarously, expelling all the renovation workers and closing the house. Cheng suffered this loss and was unwilling to accept it. He hired lawyer Gu Changyuan to file a criminal lawsuit with the court. At the court hearing, the judge was very angry at this illegal extortion and oppression by the landlord. Yang also knew that he could not escape responsibility, so he blamed the Da Hing Company and He Guoju. Whether such a person exists, the court paid close attention to. Therefore, the hearing was adjourned to the 18th, and the defendant was ordered to be released on bail of 1,000 yuan, ordering to subpoena He Guoju to the court for verification.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Budget for Police Expenses This Year

The budget proposals for the expenditures of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the Fire Department, and the Police Department for the year 1939 were submitted to the Defense Committee for review on January 30. Special expenditures are divided into two categories, A and B. Category A includes expenses that the Board of Directors has already reviewed or deems urgently needed. Category B includes expenses that, due to the financial situation or other considerations, should not be spent this year. A summary of the main points is as follows:

(A) Three special expenditures for the Volunteer Corps, totaling $55,090. Replacing two trucks, totaling $11,990. This expense is based on a plan approved in 1936 and is listed under Category A. Emergency equipment expenses of $1,000, listed under Category A. Emergency affairs expenses, including the minimum equipment needed for the engineering corps, totaling $42,800. Of this, $35,000 is for the purchase of sandbags. These sandbags are expected to last at least five years and are also listed under Category A. Regular expenditures total $883,220, an increase of $177,520 over last year's budget, a rise of 25.16 percent. The military equipment expenses for the various volunteer units total $51,300. The total expenditures for each item have increased by $43,440 compared to last year. The expenditures for the Russian unit have increased by $112,640 compared to last year. The main item is the allowance for the unit members. This unit will not be assigned to special duties at the Council's prison for the time being. Therefore, the item of $40,800, which was allocated by the Police Department in last year's budget, has been removed. Under the category of storage purchases, there are two items: car purchase expenses of $4,500 (one old car is beyond repair) and canned food expenses of $3,600. It is estimated that $44,370 will be spent on various military equipment.

### Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Kangding, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi Provinces Promote Vocational Education Plans for Agriculture and Industry

Dividing Nine Provinces into Three Regions to Be Completed Within Three Years

Sichuan-Kangding Region

"Current Situation": Sichuan Province has 22 agricultural schools and 8 industrial schools. Kangding Province's agricultural and industrial vocational schools are currently being prepared. "Improvement Plan": The agricultural and industrial vocational education in Sichuan Province has already taken shape. Since the National Government moved to Chongqing, talents have gathered. In the university sector, there are the agricultural and industrial colleges of National Central University, the industrial college of Wuhan University and Provincial Chongqing University, the agricultural college of National Sichuan University and Private Jinling University, and the reclamation specialization department of Private Fudan University, as well as the agricultural education department of Sichuan Provincial Education College, which makes guidance and promotion easier. However, Kangding Province is located in the western border, and everything needs to be built. It is planned to rationally plan the adjustment of the establishment of departments and the enrichment of content for the original agricultural and industrial schools in Sichuan Province. In terms of industry, in addition to the National Central Industrial Vocational School and the two private industrial vocational schools, Zhonghua and Dagong, the provincial Chengdu and Chongqing industrial vocational schools should be used as a foundation. The establishment of departments must be suitable for the environment, and the equipment should be completed immediately. In addition, a senior industrial vocational school should be established in a suitable location to run departments such as metallurgy, mining, cotton weaving, and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Within the province, ten junior practical vocational schools should be established in appropriate locations. The subjects offered should be limited to those necessary for people's daily life, which should be reorganized from existing junior vocational schools or added as needed. In Kangding, a senior industrial vocational school and two junior practical vocational schools should be established. The departments should include spinning, applied chemistry, and machinery. In terms of agriculture, Sichuan Province has a large number of county-level junior agricultural vocational schools, but senior agricultural schools are still insufficient. In addition to reorganizing the original provincial senior agricultural school, Sanli agricultural vocational school, and Nanchong silkworm vocational school, it is planned to establish two or three senior agricultural vocational schools to run departments such as agronomy, horticulture, aquaculture, sericulture, and agricultural product manufacturing. In addition to thoroughly reorganizing and enriching the content of the original junior agricultural vocational schools, various short-term training courses will be added as needed. In Kangding, three senior agricultural schools and two junior agricultural schools will be established, with departments such as agronomy and animal husbandry. The location and plans for the establishment of the above-mentioned schools in each province should be detailed by the Sichuan Provincial Education and Construction Bureaus and the Kangding Construction Committee, in conjunction with the five universities, National Central University, Sichuan University, Wuhan University, Provincial Chongqing University, and Private Jinling University, and the Agricultural Improvement Institute, in accordance with local conditions, and submitted to the ministry for approval.

Southwest Region

"Current Situation": Yunnan Province has 7 agricultural schools and 1 industrial school. Guangxi Province has no formal vocational schools and only has a newly established junior practical vocational school. Guizhou Province has 7 agricultural schools and 1 industrial school. "Improvement Plan": In the industrial education of Yunnan Province, only Kunhua School is established, with a senior civil engineering department, which is insufficient to meet the needs. In 1938, the Ministry of Education specially allocated funds to subsidize and ordered the school to add a mechanical department. In addition, a senior industrial vocational school or a senior industrial vocational school and three or four junior vocational schools should be established immediately. Senior schools should run departments such as mechanical, civil, electrical, mining, metallurgy, and textile engineering. Junior schools should focus on practical subjects. In terms of agriculture, in addition to reorganizing the provincial Kunhua Senior Agricultural School, enriching equipment, and adding departments, another school should be added to run departments such as agronomy, forestry, and agricultural product manufacturing. In addition to reorganizing the existing schools, junior agricultural schools should also add a school to run agronomy as the main focus. In Guizhou Province, only the provincial Guiyang School of Industry is established, with a civil engineering department. In 1938, the Ministry of Education subsidized the addition of a mechanical department. In addition, a senior industrial school should be established immediately to run departments such as mechanical, electrical, textile, and civil engineering. In addition to the provincial Anshun Junior Practical Vocational School, which has been designated by the Ministry of Education, several schools should be added in accordance with the methods of this school. In terms of agriculture, in addition to enriching the equipment of the provincial Guiyang Vocational School, another senior school should be added to run departments such as agronomy and forestry. The original schools should be thoroughly reorganized, and several schools should be added as needed. Guangxi Province has no formal vocational schools, and the newly established national middle school has not been effective and cannot replace them. It is planned to establish one or two senior industrial and agricultural vocational schools within a time limit to run departments such as machinery, metallurgy, petrochemistry, textiles, ceramics, and horticulture and agronomy. Four junior vocational schools should be added in accordance with the newly established Pingle Junior Practical Vocational School. The establishment of departments should be based on the needs of each region. The location and plans for the establishment of the above-mentioned schools in each province should be detailed by the Provincial Education and Construction Bureaus, in conjunction with the National Southwest Associated University, Zhejiang University, Tongji University, Yunnan University, Guangxi University, and other agricultural and industrial colleges, Private Daxia University Education College, and the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, in accordance with local conditions, and submitted to the ministry for approval.

### The Talents Scholarship Fund Allocates Funds for Interest-Free Student Loans

To Assist Needy and Academically Excellent Students Studying Abroad

The Talents Scholarship Fund previously selected graduates from domestic universities and sent them to various research institutions to continue their studies, so as to deepen their knowledge. After August 13, domestic cultural institutions were destroyed and students could not be sent continuously. It is now found that students studying in Europe and the United States with private funds are facing difficulties, either because their family's finances have changed or because the purchase of foreign exchange is limited, and are almost in trouble. After deliberation by the Board of Directors, it was decided to draw some money from the interest of the scholarship fund as interest-free student loans to assist needy and academically excellent students studying abroad, so that they can complete their studies. Fourteen articles of the detailed rules for interest-free student loans have been formulated and are recorded below. This move is of great help to the advancement of academic studies.

As previously reported in this newspaper, the school held its first entrance exam on the 6th of this month and conducted physical examinations at the New Asia First Clinic on the 7th. Over fifty candidates took the exam. Due to the strict testing, only twenty-six were admitted, causing disappointment among those who failed. They repeatedly pleaded with the school for leniency. It is reported that the school authorities, considering the students' eagerness to learn, have allowed most, except for those with very poor grades, to attend as probationary students. The school has decided to open two classes and will hold the second round of admissions on the 15th of this month.

Qinghua Middle School, located at 384 Fuxu Road in this city, was originally named Yuhua Vocational Middle School. It was founded on Qingyun Road, Zhabei in the spring of the 25th year (1936). Rong Zongjing served as chairman of the board, and Guo Shun, Zhu Zhisheng, and Yang Zhonghua served as directors. At the end of the 25th year, the establishment was approved by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. After the August 13th Incident, the school was located in the war zone and had to be temporarily suspended. In January of this year, to provide relief to the many out-of-school youths, Wang Zhixin, Du Zuozhou, Li Ximou, Zhou Yutong, Wu Yugan, Chen Gaoyong, Sun Ruihuang, Zhang Sumin, Dong Renjian, Cheng Ruilin, Cheng Haifeng, Zheng Zhenduo, and Xu Lun organized a new board of directors, electing Cheng Ruilin, the Academic Dean of Jinan University, as principal.

The school aims to cultivate talent and provide relief to out-of-school youths. With limited funding, tuition is very low, with junior high school costing approximately 25 yuan per semester and senior high school costing 30 yuan, with no other fees. To provide opportunities for disadvantaged children to attend school, they are recruiting 50 students with free tuition and 50 students with half-tuition. To avoid the common abuse of using free tuition as a selling point, they have stipulated that those who apply for free or half-tuition must achieve an average score of 70 or above in each subject on the entrance exam to be admitted as free students, and 60 or above to be admitted as half-tuition students. Those scoring below 60 will not be admitted. The school has selected 384 Fuxu Road (a western-style house at the west end of Chengdu Road) as its location, which is quite suitable. It is reported that the school emphasizes strict teaching and would rather have too few than unqualified students.

### Regarding Refugee Service Regulations

— Dahai

The refugee problem is indeed the most important issue at the moment. As a result of the war, refugees are almost everywhere. And as long as the war continues, the number of refugees will inevitably increase. Although the local authorities and charitable organizations have tried their best to provide relief, it is ultimately not thorough, because the so-called relief is nothing more than providing food, hygiene, education and other passive measures. The planning for refugees to become self-reliant is still a problem.

Take Shanghai as an example, the efforts of various relief organizations for more than a year have indeed fulfilled a considerable responsibility, and people from all walks of life can be said to be quite enthusiastic about the relief of refugees, which shows that "compassion is inherent in everyone." But on the one hand, despite various fund-raising efforts and generous donations, the refugees are full of food all day long and do nothing, which is also a fact that they have developed lazy habits. —Some people call refugees lazy people.—Therefore, after more than a year of lessons, people also feel that this road is not feasible, and they are planning other methods. For example, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has a Rehabilitation Committee. All work such as repatriation, dispersion, job placement, and fundraising for rehabilitation funds are being carried out vigorously, which shows the importance of thoroughly solving the refugee problem.

To thoroughly solve the refugee problem, we can only concentrate relief funds to handle refugee production work, so that they can live independently. And to carry out production work, we must first eliminate the refugees' habit of relying on laziness.

The experience of the past year has not only taught Shanghai, but also the refugees in the interior have the same problem. Therefore, the government, in view of the prolongation of the war, has issued refugee service regulations, ordering all relief areas to follow and implement them, which are recorded below for reference.

All refugees in the shelter stations of various provinces and counties, except for the old, weak, disabled, and sick, must obey the relief organization's assigned appropriate work and perform labor. Refugees who have been assigned appropriate work and who deliberately slack off or refuse to perform it, the relief organization may give the following punishments: (A) For the first time of slackness, extend the working hours and cancel their holidays. (B) For the second time of slackness, confine them for three to five days, and reduce their food by one-half during the confinement period. (C) For the third time of slackness, men of military age shall be ordered to serve in the military, and men and women not of military age shall be deported and not given relief. (D) Those who disobey orders shall be subject to the same punishment as those who commit slackness. Refugees who are confined and who can truly repent during the confinement period may be exempted from the remaining punishment. If the refugee is ordered to serve in the military and has family members, they shall continue to be given relief. Refugees who are punished with no relief must hand over their refugee symbol and other supporting documents.

The above refugee service regulations have been promulgated and implemented by the government. It is hoped that all charitable organizations will be able to handle them effectively in the future and make changes according to the actual situation in each place. For example, running factories, reclaiming wasteland, wrapping roads, introducing occupations, and other work suitable for refugees. Register the refugees' age, origin, ability, and aspirations, dispatch them to work or introduce their work to all walks of life at any time. The service and treatment of refugees should be determined according to their performance. Should be given simple organization and appropriate training to increase the effectiveness of their service. Refugees who are serving for the first time should be given assistance in their lives in the first month, but in the future it must be deducted from their wages.

### Chen Erlang (Continued)

— A Da

In fact, Man Jiang also felt sorry for Erlang when he first saw him. Man Jiang asked, "Where are your parents?"

"They died a long time ago."

"Then who is taking care of you?"

"My uncle."

"Then where is your uncle?"

"He died a few days ago."

"Is there anyone else at home?"

"No one."

"How did you escape?"

"I hid under the corpses."

Man Jiang saw that he was smart and lively, so he took his hand and patted his head, "Hey! Why don't you be my son?"

"Okay, Daddy!" The child acted like a little bird, pulling at Man Jiang's clothes.

"Ha! Little guy, you're very smart," Man Jiang was very happy and ordered the original Manchu soldiers to take care of the young master. In the future, he could take whatever he wanted.

"From then on, everyone called him Young Master."

The young master liked to play, and the Manchu soldiers had to accompany him out for a walk. But what he saw were the ruins of the fire and the corpses of women who had been humiliated. At this time, some people in the city also fled back, so a few families on the streets opened their doors. An old man from a pharmacy, who knew Erlang, suddenly saw Erlang and said in surprise, "Erlang, are you still alive?"

"Yes! Old man, are you well too?"

The old man saw the Manchu soldiers behind him and did not speak much, but shrugged his shoulders and said, "Child, you are very lucky!"

"Of course, old man! The general now recognizes me as his son, he treats me very well! ..."

"Young Master, please sit down for a moment, I'll go to the toilet?" The Manchu soldier suddenly said to Erlang:

"You go, I'll wait for you here," Erlang replied. Erlang took this opportunity to whisper a few words in the old man's ear, and then the old man nodded in agreement, then took out a package and handed it to Erlang. "Your idea is good, child, things should be done this way. I am old and have no relatives to rely on, I will die sooner or later. If things fail, I have my own way, but I hope you ..." Before he finished speaking, the Manchu soldier had returned, and Erlang was still the same as before, happily praising the benefits of his father.

Less than half a month later, the Manchu army broke out in a severe pox epidemic. The speed of the spread was astonishing. The number of deaths every day was several times higher than those killed in battle. Erlang's father and Erlang himself were also infected and fell ill. Therefore, the Manchu camp was panicked. Especially Man Jiang, based on his military experience, determined that this incident must have been a spy, so he ordered a secret investigation.

But if he hadn't investigated, it would have been fine. As soon as he investigated, it was bad, because Erlang's outing with illness had already aroused suspicion, and taking the opportunity to put medicine in the well was discovered by the Manchu soldiers this time. Pitifully, he was taken to his father.

"Little bastard, tell me, what have I done wrong to you, that you did this?"

"You wronged me," Erlang said, "My uncle was killed by you! My aunt was forced to death by you! In Jiangyin City, the people I know are all gone! All were killed by you. Now I want to avenge them, but unfortunately I have too little medicine, not enough to poison you all. It's really ..."

"Take him down!" With a command, Erlang was immediately turned into mincemeat under the axe. Later, the old man from the pharmacy, seeing that the situation was not right, also committed suicide by poisoning himself at the same time. The so-called Chen Erlang is still remembered by the people of Jiangyin today. (The End)

### It's Time for New Year's Eve Dinner, Why Not Share a Spoon with Me?

— Wang Huan, No. 16 Hongqiao Road

Time flies like lightning, like fleeting smoke. In a flash, it's the end of the lunar year again. The gentlemen, young masters, ladies, and misses who live in mansions are preparing New Year's goods and planning to eat New Year's Eve dinner! However, the disaster victims whose hometowns have been destroyed by the war are living in huts covered with reed grass, wearing some tattered old clothes, and suffering the biting northwest wind! Although they receive donations from charitable people at home and abroad and relief from various charitable organizations, there is too little porridge for too many people, so how can there be so much? Besides complaining to the world, who can they tell all their grief and pain to? Therefore, charitable people on the isolated island who are preparing New Year's goods! I have a request, which is to ask you to save only one-tenth of the New Year's goods you prepare and donate them to the refugees. This is a work of immeasurable merit. If you are sure that you have nothing to donate, the refugees can directly benefit from your kindness. I think this is not an excessive request! Perhaps you will not refuse!

### Shanghai Rice Industry Development in the Last Decade

— Chen Ziyi

My country has a vast territory and a large population. For thousands of years, it has been established on agriculture, and among agricultural products, the most complex and intricate problem is rice. Even today, this problem has not been adequately resolved. When grain is cheap, we sit idly by and watch the farmers' difficulties without taking any action; when grain is expensive, we only see merchants hoarding and speculating without being able to stabilize prices. Little do people know that price stabilization depends on the balance of supply and demand. Hoarding will inevitably be difficult to maintain, and exporting will be difficult to smuggle. People do not understand this and often blame the rice industry, leading to situations where both laughing and crying are inappropriate, and advice is often met with blame. There is a general perception that "no merchant is not a profiteer, and no rice is not good," which makes it truly difficult to be a rice merchant. The author has been engaged in the Shanghai rice industry for many years and deeply appreciates Sun Yat-sen’s saying: "The most important thing in construction is people's livelihood." What we hope for is: ① imposing tariffs on imported rice and wheat; ② allowing free circulation of domestic rice nationwide; ③ establishing a warehousing system and facilitating transportation; ④ establishing a specialized agency to investigate production and sales, improve production skills, and encourage production. For more than ten years, we have been proceeding with this, persevering without懈怠, with some successes and some requiring the combined efforts of the national economy, political power, and all levels of government to succeed. Therefore, I inform my fellow countrymen of what I have experienced, which may also be helpful to those who are concerned about the people's livelihood and food problems!

People's Food Before and After the Shanghai War

The great famine in 1930 was actually caused by repeated crop failures from 1927 to 1929, which left the granaries empty. Therefore, in that year, we relied almost entirely on rice imports from Burma and Vietnam to replenish the supply. Shanghai alone imported 12 to 13 million dan. Due to the large orders placed by our country, prices rose steadily, so the price here also rose to more than 18 yuan per hai hu (180 jin) of first-class rice. In the summer of 1931, a major flood affected thirteen provinces, making rice even scarcer and more expensive. Each stone of Jiangsu rice rose to 24 yuan, which was still after the Social Bureau made every effort to limit it. Each si cheng (100 jin) of wheat rose to more than six taels of silver. At that time, orders for foreign rice were uninterrupted until April or May of 1932. However, although the flood subsided in that year, the low-lying areas were still poor, while the high-lying fields were still fertile, and the price of grain began to decline after the autumn harvest.

In early 1932, the Shanghai War broke out. The autumn harvest of that year was exceptionally abundant, unprecedented in previous years. In addition, after the war, the vitality of the country was severely damaged, and the outside world also felt the economic downturn. Fortunately, the government successfully obtained a loan of 50 million yuan from the United States for cotton and wheat. As a result, grain prices plummeted to their previous levels. Moreover, there was still a considerable amount of foreign rice purchased in the past two years that had not been consumed, causing significant losses to rice merchants. At that time, Chairman Ye Huijun of our industry was still alive and believed that the opportunity to impose taxes on foreign rice and promote national circulation had arrived. Therefore, he encouraged Mr. Ye and Mr. Zhu Zixiang to go to Zhenjiang to meet with Chairman Niu Tiesheng of Jiangsu Province and explain the benefits in detail, which was met with approval. After Mr. Ye Huijun passed away, the association re-elected Gu Xinyi as chairman and continued to petition. In the winter, Jiangsu Province issued export permits for 100,000 shi of rice. However, what we were fighting for was comprehensive, not partial. We repeatedly submitted petitions through the Municipal Social Bureau, the Provincial Chairman, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministries of Finance and Industry. Moreover, since that year followed the great flood of 1931, commerce was depressed, and Jiangsu rice fell to less than 10 yuan per stone. Hunan high-quality coarse rice, 150 jin per si cheng, which is equivalent to 180 jin per hai hu, only sold for 5.4 yuan, and high-quality polished rice sold for 6.8 yuan. After deducting donation fees and bag costs of more than 2.5 yuan, the actual value of coarse rice was only 2.5 to 2.6 yuan, and each 100 jin of grain only yielded 1.2 to 1.3 yuan. With such grain prices, how could the rural areas not go bankrupt? Therefore, we jointly requested the provincial grain industry associations and chambers of commerce, as well as the chairmen of the five rice-producing provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Henan, to send a joint telegram to the Executive Yuan. With the joint request of officials and merchants, the Executive Yuan decided on November 15 of that year to lift the ban on the circulation of Jiangsu rice and wheat nationwide. It also ordered on December 15 to impose a 5% import tax on foreign rice and wheat (including surcharges, the total would be 18.81%), but the two provinces with the most imports, Fujian and Guangdong, had not yet complied. However, Jiangsu rice could circulate freely in 1933 without provincial permits. At the same time, we began to build rice warehouses in Shanghai. In the winter of 1932, the Sanyi Wharf had about six mu of land along the Pudong riverfront that they wanted to sell. The location was central and the transportation was convenient, so we discussed it with Mr. Zhu Zixiang, Mr. Yan Xiaoquan, and Mr. Cai Yukun and bought it. Then we hired Mr. Zhang Xiaoliang to design and build a steel-concrete wharf (a total of seven) and a three-story warehouse, which could store 100,000 shi of rice. It was completed in the winter of 1933. The cost of the land and construction was more than 480,000 yuan. In addition to raising public bonds from the industry, we also obtained a mortgage loan from the Bank of China to make up for the shortfall.

In 1934, we were still affected by the global economic recession, and the prices of miscellaneous grains fell even more sharply. Beans and wheat only sold for 2.7 to 2.8 yuan per shi cheng. Farmers suffered in the fields, and businesses suffered in the cities. By the autumn and winter of 1935, the prices of agricultural products gradually increased, and the rural areas showed signs of recovery. Industries and businesses were also thriving. The autumn harvest of 1936 was even more rare in recent years. On the one hand, prices rose again, and the momentum was unstoppable. Mr. Zhang Gongquan, Minister of Railways, and Mr. Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, were both able to work hard and diligently to promote construction, such as reforming the accumulated abuses of the railway system, buying and selling railcars, facilitating production, sales, and transportation, and cooperating with the Central Agricultural Experiment Station to establish the National Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute to improve seeds, enhance skills, and investigate and compile a general overview of national agriculture, industry, and commerce. Their contributions to the regulation of people's food were not insignificant.

According to the investigation, the total harvest of japonica and indica rice in 1936 was 86 million dan, an increase of 25 million dan compared to the previous year, which was only seen in the past four years. It was slightly lower than in 1932, about 74% of the peak year. Hunan Province was the most abundant, about 83% of the peak year. The wheat harvest was 66 million dan, an increase of 35 million dan compared to the previous year, which was only seen in the past six years, about 64% of the peak year. The production of other beans and cotton also increased. It is estimated that the total lowest cost must be more than 100 million yuan higher than the previous year. However, the price of rice in that year was not too low, while the prices of beans and wheat rose instead. High-quality white rice averaged 10.4 to 10.5 yuan per shi of 160 jin. Saigon rice was about 11 yuan per 160 jin. The price of wheat from Jiangbei along the Jinpu Railway rose from 5 yuan to 6.9 yuan per 100 jin. Wheat from Hankou rose from 4 yuan to more than 6.5 yuan. Soybeans from Dalian rose from 5.2 yuan to 6.05 yuan. Soybeans from Henan rose from 4.7 yuan to 5.9 yuan. In this year, Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia, Chicago, and other places experienced droughts. The price of foreign wheat rose frequently. Foreign merchants and flour mills abandoned Australian wheat and turned to Wuhu, Hankou, and Shanghai in our country to purchase it. As a result, the Shanghai Flour Mill Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request a ban on exports. Upon hearing the news, the Miscellaneous Grains Association argued that this year's domestic harvest was particularly abundant, and there were still many stockpiles in the mainland. They requested that the ban on exports be lifted to alleviate the farmers' difficulties. The chairmen of both associations were Mr. Gu, and they submitted the same petition, one requesting a ban and the other requesting no ban, which was almost comical. As a result, in September, the Ministries of Finance and Industry jointly decided to temporarily not prohibit the export of wheat and brought the matter to a conclusion.

Unification of Tariffs on Foreign Rice and Wheat

In 1933, the value of domestic and foreign rice imported into Guangdong was about 80 million customs taels, and foreign rice accounted for more than 70 million customs taels. The huge amount of foreign rice leaking taxes in Guangdong was alarming. In 1935, the Fujian Provincial Government left, and the tax on foreign rice in Fujian Province began to be collected uniformly. However, the total amount of rice imported nationwide in that year was still 12,965,000 metric tons. By 1936, when Chen Jitang left Guangdong, the tax on foreign rice in Guangdong Province was also collected. By then, the tariffs on foreign rice and wheat were unified nationwide. The amount of rice imported nationwide in that year was 3,103,000 metric tons, only a quarter of the previous year. This was because a large amount of rice from the abundant harvests in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui was transported to Guangdong to replace foreign rice.

The U.S. Department of Commerce published a report on China's economic situation, which stated that at the end of 1926, China's economic situation was the best since the founding of the Republic of China. (Omission) At the same time, the reduction in food imports could be slightly remedied. In terms of goods passing through customs, imports were 941,500,000 yuan, a decrease of 17% compared to the previous year. Exports were 705,700,000 yuan, an increase of 23% compared to the previous year. The total trade deficit decreased by 31%. The decrease in imports was mainly due to food, which shows that China's self-sufficiency has improved. Therefore, I believe that the year 1936 was one of the most prosperous years for the people's livelihood in the Republic of China.

In the winter of 1936, Guangdong Province again requested exemption from the foreign rice tax. The government initially did not approve it, but the province repeatedly claimed a shortage of rice and continued to request it. Finally, on January 21, the Executive Yuan decided to allow 300,000 metric tons to be taxed according to the tariff regulations, half in cash and half on credit. Later, it was increased to 1 million dan. In late February, there were rumors of a continued request for tax exemption. The Hankou Miscellaneous Grains Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to inquire about the truth. They received a telegram stating that it had been handled in accordance with the Executive Yuan's decision, allowing half of the tax to be paid in cash and half on credit, and there was no tax exemption, etc. However, in late March, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance had deleted the telegram, in addition to the foreign rice that had been transported in with half tax, it was approved to add 2 million shi of foreign rice, completely tax-free. There were two deleted telegrams, with different intentions before and after, which was very shocking. The association telegraphed the Executive Yuan to inquire, and jointly with the grain industry representatives from six provinces and cities, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, expressed in detail the reasons why the foreign rice import tax in Guangdong should not be exempted from the perspective of the integrity of the tariff, from the perspective of the national economy, it was not possible to exempt it, and from the perspective of the people's food in Guangdong, it was not necessary to exempt it. They requested that the order be withdrawn. The chambers of commerce of various provinces and Chairman Xiang of Hunan and Chairman Huang of Hubei also pleaded on their behalf. The press and public opinion in Shanghai and Hankou also expressed unanimous support. On March 9 and April 4, they decided to go to Beijing to petition. The chamber of commerce sent Luo Qinghua, and the association sent Chairman Yuan and I to petition the Ministries of Industry and Finance and the Executive Yuan. The supplementary documents were prepared in two hours, written by hand. Mr. Luo smiled and said to me, "It can be said that you are making yourself an official and clearing the way for yourself." On the 6th, the Executive Yuan held a meeting to discuss the matter. Due to the significant implications, it was decided to first submit it to the Ministries of Finance and Industry and related agencies for review, and then submit it to the Executive Yuan for deliberation. We then returned to Shanghai. Later, we saw in the newspapers that Guangdong Province had announced that the tax exemption period was from April 1 to August 30. Only then did we know that the general trend was irreversible. However, after this period of running around and appealing, not only had national public opinion been aroused, but the government also recognized that our actions were indispensable. Although it was not successful, I planned to take advantage of the fact that the representatives of the six provinces and cities were in Shanghai to organize a national grain industry association to plan for national self-sufficiency in the future. However, the Anhui representative's visit to Guangdong to investigate was unsuccessful.

People's Food During the August 13th War

With the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, rice and grain had a close relationship with the environment. Therefore, the Municipal Social Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the authorities of the British and French Concessions, together with various rice industry organizations, jointly formed a Food Regulation Committee on the sixth floor of the Pudong Native Place Association. We were also on the committee to handle the certification of the place of origin and transportation, the allocation of sales in the city, and the assessment of market prices. After about two months, rice prices were stabilized, usually between 12 and 13 yuan. By the end of October, the overall situation was gradually unsustainable, and the environment could no longer exist, so it was dissolved.

On November 12, Shanghai fell. More than 300 ships carrying rice from the interior to Shanghai by the industry via civilian ships reached southern Shanghai, with a total of more than 20,000 bags of rice, worth more than 300,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, they were delayed and extorted, and could not be transported to a safe zone for a long time. All of them were destroyed by fire, which was the most heartbreaking thing. Other miscellaneous grains in the stacks in Hongkou, Nanshi, and Pudong that could not be moved in time totaled no less than 4 to 5 million yuan, and also suffered a catastrophe. It is only natural for the people in the rear to sacrifice for the country, but it is meaningless to make meaningless sacrifices that only harm merchants. From then on, the transportation of rice and grain was cut off, and the food supply for Shanghai citizens was in imminent danger. We could only rely on foreign rice for supply. The Public Works Department also ordered a lot, and the market price rose to 21 to 22 yuan per bag. Rice was 22 yuan per stone, and each person was limited to one dou. The rice store doors were crowded with buyers, blocking the way, and some people waited all day without getting a grain of rice. The panic reached its peak. Later, a large amount of foreign rice was transported in, and the mainland gradually circulated again, and the crisis was resolved. From the small to the big, I believe that our country does not lack rice, but we are worried about the lack of self-sufficiency, and the red rot is self-defeating. The transportation is inconvenient, and it cannot be smooth.

The Process of the Transit Rice Problem

There is only one word difference between transit and export, and society is prone to misunderstanding. For example, indica rice from Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang is transported by ship to Shanghai and stored in the warehouse. Then, with the bill of lading, it can be declared and transported to various parts of the country, which is called transit. Jiangsu rice is loaded on sailboats and is not declared. According to the usual practice, it is not allowed to leave the country. Since the export order was issued in the winter of 1933, not only can any rice be transited, but it can also be exported abroad. However, in the winter of 1936, foreign merchants once purchased it. The authorities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces tightened the measures for exporting grain and even intensified their efforts. Each county established its own policies and bans. In November, hundreds of rice ships were detained in Jiaxing, Jiaxian, Pinghu, Xin'ai, and other places in Zhejiang, which greatly affected the food supply in Shanghai. Therefore, we telegraphed the Executive Yuan, and on November 24, the following four articles of the food regulation measures were decided:

Food should be allowed to circulate freely within the country to achieve a balance between supply and demand and gradually tend to be balanced. The measures proposed by various provinces and cities to restrict the export of food are inconsistent with economic principles and the central government's purpose of unified food management. All provinces and cities should immediately stop the ban on transportation. (Omission) For areas where food is insufficient this year, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank should consult with local authorities to transport grain and regulate it in abundant areas. We have now agreed on a method with local authorities in Sichuan Province. We have sent personnel to Shaanxi and Henan Provinces to contact them. Other provinces will be handled separately if they need to be regulated. There is no need to ban transportation. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank should negotiate with the Ministry of Transportation and Railways to reduce railway and shipping costs for the transportation of local food.

In May 1937, six food regulation measures were promulgated:

Food should be allowed to circulate freely within the country. Without special circumstances, and after prior approval from the Executive Yuan, local governments may prohibit or restrict entry or exit. (Omission) If the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Finance believe that a certain type of food must be banned from export, they should immediately submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval. If the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Finance believe that it is necessary to transport grain to areas where food is insufficient, they should designate the Agricultural and Commercial Bank or the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau to consult with local authorities to transport grain from abundant areas. If the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Finance believe that it is necessary to import foreign rice and wheat with tax exemptions or reductions due to domestic food shortages, they should jointly submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval, and instruct the Agricultural and Commercial Bank or the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau to purchase and transport it. Merchants are not allowed to purchase and transport it freely to prevent abuses. (Omission) These measures shall be implemented from August 1, 1937.

The interim measures for food regulation that were circulated for compliance in November 1936 were repealed on the same day. On August 11, the Ministry of Finance ordered a temporary ban on the export of rice and grain to foreign countries and the three northeastern provinces (including Dalian). The above three orders, compared with each other, are both broad and strict, which is quite thought-provoking. They are all adapted to the environment before the rich. There have been no subsequent orders.

In the spring and summer of 1938, Shanghai had a large surplus of rice, and the weather was hot. Fearing that it would become moldy, we agreed to the requests of the North and South Ocean merchants and the industry, and the Bean and Rice Industry Association decided that the price of high-quality white rice should not exceed 14 yuan. We sent a letter to the Customs, the Public Works Department, and the Chamber of Commerce, and with the certificate of the association, we declared the transit. By late June, the limit price of 14 yuan had been reached, so we automatically stopped issuing certificates and sent a letter to the above-mentioned agencies to stop reporting the transit. From June 1 to July 1, a total of 194,959 bags of rice were exported. After the autumn, the market price fell, and various provinces sent letters and telegrams one after another. The industry also demanded to resume the transit. I discussed with Mr. Cai Yukun and the members of the executive committee. The current transportation is difficult, and the environment is different. We must wait for the autumn harvest to be free of change and the late rice to be fully harvested before we can convene a meeting to discuss and handle it carefully. Unexpectedly, the outside world did not understand and mistakenly believed that I and Mr. Cai insisted on opposing it. In fact, what we advocated was entirely for the sake of Shanghai's food supply. When the late rice was harvested, the harvest was still abundant. The North and South Ocean merchants and the industry repeatedly requested to resume it. As late as November 8, a meeting was held to decide that from November 16, the association would still issue certificates for the transit by declaring with the certificate documents of the place of origin chamber of commerce. The Customs, the Public Works Department, and the Chamber of Commerce all followed the example of the first half of the year and sent letters for inspection. On the one hand, the North and South Ocean merchants successively entrusted the industry to process 100,000 bags of rice in preparation for transit. Unexpectedly, the declaration was rejected when the deadline was reached. The association prepared a letter and commissioned Jiang Hongbin to see Mr. Lawford, the Shanghai Customs Commissioner, and said that it should contact the British Public Works Department again. Later, the association commissioned me and Mr. Zhu Zixiang to repeatedly prepare letters to negotiate with Mr. Wu, the chief of the British Public Works Department, and handle some cumbersome investigation department procedures. Then the board of directors decided to hand it over to the Food Committee of the Bureau for review and handling. The resolution of the Food Committee was a double restriction on quantity and market price, that is, in addition to stopping the transit when the highest price of white rice was limited to 14 yuan, the quantity was also limited to 20,000 bags in November and 30,000 bags in the first half of December, and the market conditions would be considered in the second half of the month. The certificate of the association was not required, and the declaration could be made with the permit issued by the Bureau. Unexpectedly, the declaration with the Bureau's certificate was rejected again. When asked about the reason, the Bureau said that it was still waiting to be cleared, but there was no news after waiting for more than ten days. The regulation of transit rice was required to collect a refugee donation of five cents, which had already been lost. One day, I attended the Standing Committee of the Refugee Association and reported the information and asked Lao to ask Tax Commissioner Luo for the truth, saying that indica rice from the ship could be transited, but rice could not be transited. What should be done? Our industry had to inquire with the Customs in detail. The next day, the association again pushed me and Jiang Hongbin, Yang Dingchen to visit Tax Commissioner Luo, but he did not meet us. However, he instructed us to contact another deputy tax commissioner, who was Norwegian. Mr. Yang was good at English, and translated and talked for a long time, but we did not get the point, and the subtext was clearly visible. We only asked to consult with Tax Commissioner Luo again and waited for a reply. Two days later, we were directly led to the office of a deputy tax commissioner, and Mr. Yang translated in English, and he replied that the Public Works Department had no jurisdiction over the Huangpu River, and could not interfere in the customs administration. Since the rice and grain in the non-occupied areas could not come, Shanghai had a large population, and no one was allowed to declare the transit. After exiting, we sighed with each other. After more than a month of running around, we finally realized it. However, our industry only hoped that the 100,000 bags that had already been processed by the North and South Ocean Merchants, if they could be transited, would reduce a standstill dispute over delivery and collection. I would no longer take the blame for others. However, the news collected by the news agencies was not entirely accurate, and the events were greatly exaggerated. There were also rumors that Yu Qiaqing talked about the order from the Ministry of Finance to stop the transit. In fact, the Ministry of Finance had not issued a subsequent order after the order of August 11. It was certain that someone opposed it, fearing that the implementation of the transit of Shanghai rice would greatly hinder the convenience of the imperial procurement, so they used the name of protecting Shanghai's food supply to instigate opposition. However, Mr. Feng Liutang's article on the equal discussion of the national rice transit issue (Shen Bao, November 23 and 24) could indeed deeply analyze and see the point. Mr. Feng was one of the first people to plan Shanghai's food supply and was in charge of food, so he knew the situation in detail. The various circles in this case are still in the fog, and now that things have passed, I will express it out. Since the transit problem was stopped, a large amount of rice and grain in the mainland has been transported out, which is appropriate to see that the opponents are creating opportunities for others, and now the silent people dare not say a word.

Since the transit problem came to an end, the Shanghai Customs did not report the transportation, but the Japanese had already been in various places in the mainland, such as Songjiang, Pinghu, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Changshu, Wuxi, Hupu, and Wuhu, etc., in large quantities, and loaded and exported them from Jinshanwei, Zhapu, Baima Hupu Port, and Bailonggang by transport ships. In the past two months, it has been no less than one million bags, about more than one million shi. The destination is generally for military use, and Japanese merchants trade for profit, and transport them to Japan for Japanese consumption. Chinese merchants used British ships in Hupu and also loaded more than 100,000 bags, most of which were transported to Shantou. As a result, the market price in the mainland has exceeded Shanghai, and Shanghai will not become a dead port. I wonder if the general high-profile people also have a thought about the future crisis of Shanghai's food supply!

There May Be Problems with Future Food Supply

Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has risen from 11 yuan to 12 yuan following the mainland. However, there is currently a lot of grain stored in Shanghai, close to one million bags, about 1.3 to 1.4 million shi. All the stacks are full, and there is no more space. Because the stacks in Hongkou, Nanshi, and Pudong can originally store millions of bags to more than 10 million bags, now there are only stacks in the two concessions and temporary stacks. It is appropriate for those who want to store them, and the supply is in short supply. According to the current population of Shanghai, at least 3 million bags of rice should be stored in order to be prepared for contingencies. Currently, it seems that there is no place for the seven rises in one or two months. However, Japan suffered a major flood and typhoon last year, and with the expedition of 2 million strong men, there were few people farming, and the harvest was greatly reduced. Moreover, the purchase of rice from the Chinese mainland can use Japanese military tickets and counterfeit money, which is actually no different from exchanging waste paper for Chinese rice and grain. Moreover, those who have purchased it from Vietnam in the past cannot continue to purchase it due to the Japanese economic relations. In the future, in addition to purchasing a small number of applications, labor must still continue to purchase the most in the mainland, which will cause the rural goods to be empty and the treasury to be exhausted. The food problem in various places will cause serious panic, and Shanghai's food supply will be even more worrying.

Since June 1, 1938, Japan has unilaterally changed the customs tariffs and restored the old precedents before 1933, and all countries are not at a loss (except for our country). Because foreign rice and wheat have been exempted from taxes, Tianjin and Shanghai have a large number of rice and wheat flour orders. Tianjin has ordered more than 10,000 tons of foreign rice, each bag weighing 200 jin, and the price is 16.5 to 17 yuan. A ship of foreign wheat, totaling 8,000 tons, is priced at 7.5 to 7.6 yuan per dan. Six million bags of foreign flour, each bag priced at 4.2 to 4.3 yuan. Shanghai has ordered six ships of foreign wheat, totaling 50,000 tons, priced at 7.5 yuan. Fifty million bags of foreign flour, priced at 4.2 to 4.3 yuan. Most of the delivery dates are in February and March. The countries are Australia and the United States. The total cost is about 31.2 million in Tianjin and 8.9 million in Shanghai. Although foreign exchange is strictly managed, it can still be facilitated in the black market. Foreign countries are exporting at low prices due to overproduction, and the governments also subsidize their merchants to export. Therefore, under the state of large-scale food items being directly shipped from the Chinese mainland, Shanghai's food supply may be foreign rice for consumption by the summer of this year. Currently, Saigon rice is priced at 16.5 to 17 yuan per 200 jin, which is 13.5 to 14 yuan per 160 jin, which is still more than 2 yuan away. However, if Shanghai rises by 1 yuan, and Saigon falls by a few cents to 1 yuan, it can be close to it, and it can be ordered. I am not worried about the food problem, but the foreign exchange balance of international trade will be a huge loss.

There are still many rice-producing areas in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei in the hands of the National Army. In addition to the areas that have fallen in Hubei Province, such as the counties along the Yangtze River and Gan River in Jiangxi, such as Yugan, Xinjian, Guixi, and Jinxian, and the areas along the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake in Hunan, such as Xiangyin, Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Changsha, Yiyang, Pingjiang, Changde, and Yuanjiang, and the counties along the Yangtze River, Xiang River, and lake in Hubei, such as Tianmen, Hanchuan, Huangpi, Xiaogan, Huanggang, Yichang, Jiangling, Xiangyang, and Gucheng, the government should take this opportunity to prepare military supplies and benefit the rural areas, which is a win-win situation.

Recent Situation of Shanghai Rice Industry

Last year, the life of the isolated island led to the abnormal development of various industries, but our industry had not yet recovered from the respite of the previous year, and added losses last year. There are three reasons: ① Between spring and summer and autumn and winter, there were two times when the price of rice rose at the place of origin, and after being transported to Shanghai, the Shanghai market fell, and some lost up to 3, 4, or 5 yuan per bag. ② A cargo ship carrying 2,000 tons of wheat from Jiangbei along the way was robbed, and 5,000 tons of rice, wheat, and beans from Wuhu were stranded and sunk. ③ Transportation along the way requires a huge amount of money, which is difficult to estimate. For example, in Changxi, Jiangsu, the cost per bag was 7 to 8 cents before the war, and now it is 3.1 to 3.2 yuan. In Wuhu, it was 1.6 to 1.7 yuan before the war, and now it is 5.2 to 5.3 yuan. In Jiangbei, it was 1.3 to 1.4 yuan before the war, and now it is 4.7 to 4.8 yuan. The more transshipment docks, the heavier the exploitation. Among them, the loading and unloading business tax is 4 to 5 cents, and the Shanghai Avenue Donation is 1 yuan. No wonder when the price of rice was the lowest, the farmers in Wuhu and other places only received 8 cents per dan, and the farmers in the four townships of Jingzu Road received less than 2 yuan. The farmers and merchants are in trouble, which can be seen. Alas! —January 1939—

### Commercial News

### New Peep Show

— Golden Tooth

Around the end of the year, there are often peep shows on the streets. A Shandong man, dressed in ragged clothes, beats gongs and drums, and shouts loudly, his golden teeth flashing as he sings loudly beside the pictures. His methods are old and worn, but they can still attract many viewers, making it a form of popular entertainment.

When I have nothing to do, I often spend two copper coins to see what it's all about. Things like Wang the Blind Catching an Adulterer, a Prostitute Soliciting Customers, and Wu Song Killing His Sister-in-Law. In addition to the pictures, there are also mechanical changes. As soon as the mechanism is triggered, heads roll, which is very vivid. There are also a few pictures depicting the Eight-Nation Alliance attacking Beijing and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War, but generally speaking, the content is corrupt and depraved.

However, I also wonder why the peep show cannot maintain the consistent style of the Eight-Nation Alliance attacking Beijing? Why must it be accompanied by obscene pictures? What is the point of that? But on closer thought, there is some reason behind it. Perhaps it has its objective social significance, although I always feel uncomfortable with the peep show, not with the way it's done, but with its content. What a pity!

"If I could also put on a peep show for people to watch, how would I embarrass myself?" I would also ask myself this. "Of course, I'm not a professional peep show performer, so naturally I wouldn't be able to perform it well."

But I can play it in a seemingly correct way! Listen to me:

(Singing) The gongs and drums sound loud, everyone, please listen. I don't need to sing about Wu Song Killing His Sister-in-Law today, I'll just sing about what's happening now, all of it. If you ask me what I'm singing about? (Don't move, don't move, clang) Please sit down and listen to me (Don't move, don't move, clang)

Ah! Look carefully, look closely, the map of China is on the screen. There are high mountains in the west and seas in the east. The surrounding outline is like a crabapple. The land is in the temperate zone with a large population, and the products are abundant and inexhaustible. (Don't move, don't move, clang) Ah! China is really a good place! (Don't move, don't move, clang)

Ah! There are many products, inexhaustible. The Five-Power Republic is prosperous. The people are rich and know etiquette, and everyone is not worried about food and clothing. They work diligently from sunrise to sunset, truly a paradise. (Don't move, don't move, clang) Ah! Every family happily spends their time. (Don't move, don't move, clang)

Ah! Spending time, spending time, makes people feel flustered. They attack in the morning and rob in the evening, and storms rise on the Pacific Ocean. (Don't move, don't move, clang) Ah! From then on, China suffered. (Don't move, don't move, clang)

Ah! Speaking of it, it's a long story. In the year of Jiawu, a war was fought. Ceding land doesn't count, and we had to pay millions of taels of silver. (Don't move, don't move, clang) The paper tiger was exposed from then on. (Don't move, don't move, clang)

Ah! The Manchu Qing Dynasty was so muddled, having an army but unable to resist. Originally, a tiger entered China through the front door, but who knew a wolf would enter through the back door. China was really unlucky (Don't move, don't move, clang) Ah! Sores grew on the bald head (Don't move, don't move, clang) Ah! From then on, it was even more rampant, and inferior goods were loaded into China. The methods of capitalism were strong, and they treated China entirely as a market. (Don't move, don't move, clang) Ah! Machines were brought in to open factories! (Don't move, don't move, clang)

Ah! Bringing in machines, opening factories, the Chinese people suffer the most. They earn silver to make guns and cannons, and when they bump into something, they want to use knives and guns. The suffering is endless, (Urging knives and guns) (Everyone) Slave life is the same for you and me (Moving knives and guns)

(White) It is said that the Chinese people, under the muddled policies of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, have suffered so much hardship until now, leaving the people impoverished and the countryside bankrupt. There are civil wars and famines every year, coupled with rising prices and difficult living conditions. People are reduced to not being able to cultivate their fields and not being able to keep their jobs. The whole of China seems to have contracted consumptive disease, and its vitality is greatly damaged, getting worse day by day. Taking Shanghai as an example, large numbers of unemployed people from the countryside have either gone to work in factories or are doing other hard labor. There are countless people who have nothing to do. Seeing that China's future is very dangerous, and the lives of the Chinese people will be even worse, what is to be done? Listeners, wait a moment, what was just said is still the civilized method of capitalism. The so-called civilized method is to use capital to do business to make China poor, making the people weaker and weaker under their heavy oppression. But after "September 18th," the civilized method was abandoned by the ambitious. They thought it was not applicable. They have another method, which is to rob by force. From then on, they don't need to do business, because the method of doing business is not strong enough. If you don't believe it, look at the facts.

(Singing) In the past, they did business, now they use knives and guns. A country has already become a ghost under the guns, and Western countries are panicking in the midst of infighting. China is also a destination, (Moving knives and guns) Ah! East, west, north, and south are battlefields (Urging knives and guns)

Ah! Guangdong Province, the sound of cannons is loud, and the war is now on the Three Rivers. Landing in Lanzhou to take the rear route, determined to seize Guangxi. Thanks to the brave Guangdong army for resisting (Moving knives and guns) (White) "Ping! Pong!" Damn it, it's either you die or I die. (Moving knives and guns)

Ah! Hubei Province, there is Yueyang, which has become a battlefield after being occupied. A battle was fought a few months ago, and the people fled their homes. People say that the people of Hunan Province have good morale, (Moving knives and guns) Ah! I say that the people of Shanxi Province have the same strong morale. (Moving knives and guns)

Ah! Shanxi Province, the war is chaotic, and the sound of cannons in Hejin is like thunder. After Xiangning and Daning were captured, the army advanced to Zhongyang. Ah! Guerrilla warfare is really effective, (Moving knives and urging guns) Avoiding the strong and attacking the weak is a good strategy. (Moving knives and guns)

Ah! Jiangsu Province and Zhejiang Province, half of them have been occupied and are in a mess. People need passports to travel back and forth, and goods need silver dollars to enter and exit. Ah! There is no need to talk about the hardships of life, (Moving knives and guns)

Ah! Lang dang, lang dang, and lang dang again (Moving knives and guns)

Ah! Each province, each border region, I don't need to talk about it in detail. In short, in one sentence, the mountains and rivers are broken and people are killed and injured. Ah! In the past, the world was green and white, (Don't move, don't move, clang) But now the map is being devoured by silkworms, (Moving knives and guns)

Hey! Everyone, listen to the short and the long, where do you live? Are things going well at home? Are your family members all safe and sound? If there are also long and short, (Moving knives and guns) You should go home as soon as possible. (Moving knives and guns)

Ah! Look inside, look closely, the refugees are reflected on the screen. Refugees used to live in good houses, and refugees used to have good fields. But now, refugees live in shelters (Don't move, don't move, clang) Only getting a lamb that is homeless and without a room, (Don't move, don't move, clang)

Ah! Refugees suffer, suffer so much, refugees live in reed sheds! People have tall houses and mansions, people have cars and Western-style houses, sunshine and air are sufficient, and electricity and water are warm, (Don't move, don't move, clang) Ah! Refugees only seek shelter from the wind and frost! (Don't move, don't move, clang)

Ah! Refugees suffer, suffer so much, refugees eat coarse grains! People have good dishes for their appetite, people have the interest to order wine. The whole family is happy and healthy, playing guessing games and drinking happily, (Don't move, don't move, clang) Ah! Refugees only seek to fill their stomachs. (Don't move, don't move, clang)

Ah! Refugees suffer, suffer so much, refugees wear tattered clothes. Young masters and young ladies come to help, and everyone shows a good heart. Clothing and bedding benefit thousands of families, and saving people accumulates immeasurable blessings, (Don't move, don't move, clang) (White) The peep show is over, (Sing) Please come and give me some rewards. (Don't move, don't move, clang! Don't move, don't move, clang!)

### Doing Good is the Greatest Joy

— Refugee Reporter

"It is better to enjoy with others than to enjoy alone." This is what Mencius said. In modern terms, it should be said that it is better for everyone to be happy than for one person to be happy.

Buying a lot of New Year's fish and meat, playing the New Year's drums loudly, this is the joy of one person, the joy of one family.

But, please don't forget: There are people who don't have porridge to eat, there are people who don't have vegetables to bite. Behind the clanging of the drums, there are sobbing sounds! Suffering compatriots are crying for hunger, then, in your soul, in your spirit, you must also feel unhappy.

How can we make everyone happy? Only "doing good is the greatest joy." If you can do good, so that suffering compatriots have porridge to eat, have clothes to wear, and stop their crying; if they can barely survive their suffering, you will also get the supreme comfort of a clear conscience. Isn't this the "greatest joy"?

### One Week of War

Shanxi Province

In Shanxi Province, the Japanese troops at various passes have been very active in their attacks on the Chinese army in the past week. The Japanese troops in the Zhongtiao Mountains suffered a temporary setback, so more than 2,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry troops from Huo County, accompanied by more than ten mountain field guns, advanced towards Xiang in three routes. After being attacked by the Chinese army, a fierce battle took place in the Yuantou Village area. The Japanese army was again at a disadvantage, so they fired a large amount of asphyxiating gas to assist in the battle. Later, Chinese reinforcements arrived from the north and south, and after flanking the Japanese army, the momentum of the Japanese army decreased. They are now still in a stalemate in the Wangjiali area, continuing the fierce battle. As for the 5,000 Japanese troops in eastern Shanxi, they advanced towards Liaoxian in three routes from Heshun, while firing gas bombs. The Chinese army had no choice but to retreat temporarily for fear of heavy casualties. Afterwards, fresh Chinese troops arrived and launched a brave counterattack, finally forcing the Japanese army to retreat, and officially recovered Liaoxian. They are now advancing towards Heshun.

Guangdong Province

In the Guangdong war, there has not been much change in the past week on the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Yuehan Railways. However, the old Japanese troops in the Sanshui area have made some progress after being continuously attacked by the Chinese army. However, the Japanese troops in Shengang have also launched fierce attacks on the Chinese army, combining infantry and artillery, with a vigorous momentum. After the Chinese army resisted bravely and engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat, they were able to maintain their original front line, and are now adopting an encirclement strategy against the Japanese troops in Shengang, intending to launch a gate attack. On the sea surface around Xuwen and Jeju Island in the southern route, more than 30 Japanese warships are cruising back and forth without any action. However, it is heard that the Japanese army has newly transferred two squadrons of chemical warfare troops from Taiwan, carrying 40 tons of gas.

Henan Province

In Henan Province, there is a brigade of old Japanese troops in Xinxiang, a brigade of Japanese troops in Xiuwu, and a brigade in Boai Qinyang. Recently, there has been no change in the military situation in Boai. The 25th Regiment of the Japanese army in Xinxiang, after capturing the Chinese army's Yuanwu Zhandian, met in Yangqiao in the flooded area on the 6th and 7th to invade, but they have been repelled by the Chinese army and there is no action now. As for eastern Henan, a division of Japanese soldiers occupied Kaifeng, Dafeng, and Huaiyang, and used local bandits to occasionally invade the Chinese army's flooded area to the west. In southern Henan, it is reported that the Migin Garrison Brigade, with a total of 5,000 to 6,000 people, occupied Changtaiguan Juehe, Youhezhen and other places, but there was no major action.

Hubei

Yuekou and Tianmen in central Hubei were successively captured by the Chinese army. Later, more than 2,000 Japanese troops from Jingshan Yingcheng attacked Zaoshi again, launching another fierce attack on Tianmen. The Chinese army took advantage of the remaining power of the new victory, and its momentum was extremely brave. After a fierce battle, it was able to encircle the Japanese army. It is now rumored that the Japanese army is rushing to build fortifications in the suburbs of the city, attempting to resist stubbornly. In southern and northern Hubei, the positions of the Chinese and Japanese sides are still in a stalemate and there is no change. The large Japanese army has adopted a consolidation policy for the outer regiments of Wuhan, because the Chinese side's attacks from all sides are really too much to handle.

### Finance - Joint Reserve Bank Counterfeit Money - Not Successful in Hongkou

Yesterday, this column published an article titled "The Appearance of Joint Reserve Bank Counterfeit Money: North China Has Become a Paper World," with accompanying illustrations and comprehensive explanations. This immediately shocked viewers and caused widespread anger. Worthless pieces of paper, in the thousands and tens of thousands, are circulating in the market, disrupting finance and robbing the people of their wealth. Once "the situation is gone and the monkeys scatter," the counterfeit money and mixed coins are equal to waste paper, without a doubt. What is of hidden concern is the general public in North China, who are forced to exchange valuable legal tender for this useless waste paper, working as slaves for others, which is hateful.

Recently, it has been heard that this "counterfeit money" has also been discovered in a corner of Hongkou in this port. Using coercion and enticement, they are forcing people to use it, as if they were shameless warlords issuing "military tickets" in the same ugly state. At the same time, they are sparing no means to lure the public. Recently, it was stipulated by a certain party that anyone holding "counterfeit money" to exchange for "legal tender" at a certain bank could receive a premium of two cents per yuan, deliberately raising the price of "counterfeit money" to make the public greedy for petty gains and happy to use it. But what is the effect? The local merchants and residents are well aware of the righteousness and see through their tricks. Upon receiving this "counterfeit money," they are terrified. Now that they have heard of this outlet, they are all rushing to exchange it to avoid being implicated. As a result, someone "lost the printing fee and also lost money," paying the premium in vain, but the "counterfeit money" is still difficult to circulate, exhausting their efforts and calling out in vain.

However, in this environment, although "counterfeit money" is not successful in Hongkou at present, the intentions of a certain party are unpredictable and they are using the tiger's might to bully others. It is difficult to guarantee that they will not make a comeback one day and use cunning tricks. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the people of the isolated island will not be lured by profit or succumb to coercion, but will fight to the end with an indomitable spirit. Then the country will be fortunate, and the legal tender will be fortunate. (Pei)

### British Pure Gold Rebounds, Cash Does Not Trade, Jewelry Gold Remains at Original Price

The cash market was sluggish yesterday due to the usual Sunday holiday, resulting in very few people gathering in the market that day. Only a certain money exchange firm still wanted to buy in at 2,054 yuan, but because there were no sellers, no deals were made.

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops has not changed. Dahantong and Laoqingyun, etc., still maintain the original price of 208 yuan, while new firms hang at 206 yuan and buy in at 200 yuan.

London, 11th: Although British pure gold has been stable after being supported by the pound, people's hearts have been panicked by the Spanish civil war, so each ounce suddenly increased by one and a half pence, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 pence.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Rise

London, 11th: Some people covered short positions in the silver market, and there were few transactions. The market was flat, with the near-term contract rebounding to 18.75 and the far-term contract rebounding to 0.0625. New York silver: The American silver price remained unchanged as before. Also, Bombay: The Indian silver market was firm and stable, with both spot and near-term contracts rising by three annas, and the far-term contract also rising by two annas.

### Grain - Hangzhou and Shaoxing Rice Stir the Shanghai Market

Yesterday, there were ten sources of national rice, and there were also more than 3,000 packages of wagon rice. The market was sluggish at the opening of the morning market. Later, the northern merchants heard that there was news that the Hangzhou and Shaoxing merchants in Changshu, Wuxi and other areas of the interior were actively buying rice, and people's hearts suddenly became firm. At the same time, sojourners heard the news and took advantage of the low prices to compete for purchases. The local market was already strong, and the hoarders were also concentrated, resulting in a tight situation and a chaotic situation. Generally speaking, it did not deviate from the atmosphere during the closing period. As a result, the northern merchants raised the price of japonica rice by one cent, and the southern merchants settled the price of japonica rice. Except for the high-grade and original packages of thin rice, which were not affected, the river cargo fell by one or two cents due to the relationship of crushing the husks. Duyangjian and Bujian cargo were scarce and followed the northern japonica rice market, rising by a corner, while the transformer had a wide path and rose by two corners.

### Yarn and Cotton - Indian Cotton Weekend Statistics

Bombay: Indian cotton statistics from September 1st of last year to February 11th of this year are as follows (unit: thousand bales, each bale 400 pounds):

### Changes in Shanghai's Industry and Commerce in the Past Year - Hui

In the past year, Shanghai's environment has been in the so-called isolated island state, and legitimate industry and commerce have suffered tremendous blows, struggling to maintain themselves. On the surface, Shanghai's prosperity has become even more prominent. Because of this, the changes in industry and commerce in the past year are worthy of our attention. Here, let's talk about them below:

Newly Opened

In the past year, a total of 491 new industrial and commercial enterprises have opened in Shanghai; of which only 25 are factories, while commercial firms account for 466. This is because it is very difficult to establish a factory. The source of raw materials is often subject to unexpected obstacles, and the products cannot compete with the special goods that are dumped with heavy taxes. Even if there are capitalists with the ambition to invest, they feel that opening a factory on an isolated island is not suitable, so there are only 25 factories. Although the number of newly opened commercial firms is not small in number, an investigation into the facts reveals that most of them belong to abnormally developed industries. This can be proved by the classification of industry and commerce. Among the 491 newly opened businesses, the catering industry accounts for 129, accounting for more than one-quarter of the total; followed by the daily necessities industry with 85, the clothing industry with 58, the cultural industry with 53, the pharmaceutical industry with 31, the entertainment industry with 27, the decoration industry with 26, the metal and electrical industry and the financial industry with 16 each, special industries with 11, the health industry with 7, the civil engineering industry, the fuel industry, and the transportation industry with 6 each, the transportation industry and the public utility industry with 4 each, the travel industry with 3, and other unspecified industries with 3.

Furthermore, comparing the opening of the 491 new industrial and commercial enterprises in each month, November ranks first with 98, December ranks second with 73, May ranks third with 55, September ranks fourth with 53, October ranks fifth with 50, April ranks sixth with 33, August ranks seventh with 32, June ranks eighth with 31, March ranks ninth with 25, January ranks tenth with 16, July ranks eleventh with 13, and February ranks last with 12. It should be pointed out here that the number of new openings in November and December is particularly large compared to other months, because there were two market openings in those two months, and more than 40 firms participated, so the number of new openings was relatively large. At the same time, it can be seen from the number of new openings in each month that the number has been gradually increasing since March, because the isolated island order gradually recovered from that time onwards, and the population from various places also came one after another. As a result, the deformed commerce developed, and the number of firms also increased. Here is a table listing the industry, category and number of new openings each month.

### Sugar Market - Foreign Sugar Shortage, National Sugar Expected to Stabilize

Last week, foreign sugar saw tight foreign exchange and the approaching end of the year. Various firms sold less, so spot goods suddenly felt scarce, and the market situation tightened. Dutch coarse white rose from 24 yuan to 24.15 yuan, and transshipment cargo rose from 15.775 yuan to 16.2 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B-mark also rose by 6 corners. National sugar, such as Chaoqing and Shaoqing, arrived less, and the production price also rose, all showing a tight situation. The rest were all stable.

The guild's auction had few transactions. For example, the total number of transactions for coarse white and wagon white was about 2,000 packages. Taikoo Company offered 11,000 packages of wagon white for immediate loading. There were thousands of packages of Zhiyang offered by Chao merchants, more than 800 packages of Shanchi, more than 200 packages of Chaoqing, hundreds of packages of Hainan Chi, hundreds of packages of Mianbai, and more than 200 packages of Chi Xingbai and miscellaneous packages of white offered by Min merchants. There were also several dozen packages of miscellaneous white. Arrivals included 3,850 packages of Taikoo Sugar from Hong Kong, 270 packages of red and white sugar, and more than 1,000 pieces of wagon ice. National sugar arrivals included 121 packages of Pianqing, 131 packages of Hainan Chi, and 331 packages of Shanchi.

Observing the recent market for foreign sugar, coarse white and wagon white have both rebounded, and the production price has also been set. For the time being, it is unlikely that there will be excessive fluctuations. However, it is heard that the Minghua Japanese Sugar Factory will have products, and there is talk of someone contracting for sales. At that time, there may be fluctuations due to this, but it is also unknown. National sugar has a very firm foundation and is expected to stabilize. Here is a comparison of recent markets:

### Metals: Recent Situation of British, American, and Italian Tinplate

The tinplate circulating in the market is divided into three types, namely No. 24, No. 26, and No. 28. Their dimensions are all 30 inches long and 36 inches wide. Each case is packaged in two types: 50 sheets and 56 sheets. It is verified that the 50-sheet package is a product of British, Italian, and other countries, and the 56-sheet package is a special product of the United States. Its use is most procured by spinning mills, machine factories, toy factories, hardware factories, etc., and the Tianjin merchants also account for a considerable portion. The individual situations are analyzed as follows: No. 24 is a necessity for spinning mills to make rollers, with annual sales reaching approximately 2,000 cases (but most of it is self-ordered by the factories, and sales among peers account for only about 40%). Other toy factories, gas mask factories, and lock factories also have considerable outlets. In terms of market prices, British and Italian goods are sold at 142 yuan per case, while American goods are sold at 150 yuan per case, both of which are more than 10 yuan higher than the previous market price. It is found that the inventory in this port is already low, and holders are speculating on prices, fearing that there may be a possibility of further price increases. No. 26 has a wider sales scope than No. 24, with annual sales reaching 2,500 to 2,600 cases. Its only outlet is gas mask factories and machine factories, etc., with other sales accounting for only 10% to 20%. The current market price is 128 yuan per case (British and Italian goods) and 134 yuan per case (American goods), which is also an increase of 7 to 8 yuan compared to the previous market price. An investigation shows that there are only a little over a hundred cases in Shanghai's inventory, but no new goods have arrived, and the future market standard is becoming increasingly tight. No. 28, very little of this product is purchased by peers in the market, but most of it is purchased by yarn tube factories. The market price is 105 yuan per case (British and Italian goods) and 110 yuan per case (American goods). Because the entry and exit of this product is rare, the market price is still on par with the previous market price.

### Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms Continue to Trade Tea

Yesterday in the foreign tea market, a total of 815 cases of high and medium-grade "Zhen Mei" tea from foreign firms and six cases of "Bao Zhu" tea were traded. Market prices were quite firm. All tea varieties, except for the sales of "Zhen Mei," also required "Zhu Cha" tea. But unfortunately, the inventory in the market is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Although there were good prices, the transactions were still extremely rare. The transaction quantities of each foreign firm are recorded as follows: Jardine Matheson, "Jin Zhen," "Tian Xiang," and other brands of "Zhen Mei" tea, 370 cases, priced from 88 yuan to 140 yuan. "Xie He Jin Zhen Liu Xiang" brand "Zhen Mei" tea, 175 cases, priced from 92 yuan to 122 yuan. "Bao Long Jin Liu Xiang Yong Zhen Mei" tea, 184 cases, priced from 92 yuan to 105 yuan. "Ren Ji Jin Zui Xiang Chou Xin Zhen Mei" tea, 7 cases, priced at 160 yuan. Also, "Jin Liu Xiang Yong Zhen Mei" tea, 69 cases, priced from 112 yuan to 120 yuan. Also, six cases of "Guo Pin Pai Shi Zhu" tea, priced at 105 yuan.

### Coal: Cooked Coal Actually Replaces Peach with Plum

The cooked coal business, since the outbreak of the war the year before last, due to the soaring prices of white coal dust and coal balls, with actual goods being extremely scarce, has actually replaced peach with plum, rising rapidly to prominence and not declining to this day. Some users are using cooked coal to replace coal balls. It is heard that the daily transaction value is around 200 to 300 tons, with prices quoted at 40 yuan per ton for lump coal and 36 yuan for small pieces. Peers and customers have the same listed price, while door-to-door retail is priced at 2 yuan and 1.8 yuan per load.

### Will Not "Perish Together"

— Fei Ma

Pious Christians, seeing the current world in such great turmoil, with killing and arson everywhere, sadly cite the words of their Lord, saying: "The end is near!" When the end comes, everyone will "perish together."

However, these are just "pious" words, and should not be believed as "truth." Just like in the film "Peter the Great," when Peter the Great removed a large bell from a church in order to manufacture weapons, the foolish people were terrified and shouted, "The end is near! The end is near!" However, Russia not only did not reach the "end," but embarked on a "new path." The reason why Peter the Great wanted to remove the bell was to "defend against insults" and to "strengthen the country." History will not be interrupted, so the world will not have an "end," and even if there is an "end," it will only be for those tyrants who violate the laws of historical evolution! Therefore, it is obvious that "perishing together" does not exist between "truth" and "unreasonableness"!

The war between China and Japan is not a war of "unreasonableness" against "unreasonableness," which no one would deny; but a war of "truth" against "unreasonableness," which is also a universally recognized fact. Only in a war of "unreasonableness" against "unreasonableness" is there a danger of "perishing together." The European War of 1914, in which capitalism exhausted itself in the struggle for colonies and almost ruined everyone's "life," is the best example. But in history, the weak have always achieved victory under the pressure of even the strongest oppressors. Is not the independence of America a fair illustration?

Not long ago, the puppet leaders of the pseudo-Mongolian government, Li Shou-hsin, Yu Pin-qing, Xia Gong, and other four puppets, visited Japan to meet with the leading figures of the Japanese military and political circles, and repeatedly tried to visit Saionji, but were rejected. Later, Prime Minister Konoe introduced them, and they said angrily: "What talk of Sino-Japanese friendship? Anyway, if China perishes and Japan perishes, we will all be slaves of a conquered country." This is because Saionji did not clearly see that this Sino-Japanese war is a war of "truth" against "unreasonableness."

But in the invading country, there is actually a "both-perish" view like that of Saionji. Although it is erroneous, it can already understand the sadness of Japan. However, Wu Peifu, whom the enemy regards as a "treasure," also had the words "...if it is prolonged further, then no matter who wins or loses, we will all perish together" in a written statement recently published by his adopted son. Obviously, these words are in the same vein as those of Saionji, and they have turned history upside down. However, this also explains why "Wu Peifu" is "Wu Peifu," and it is sad that our "friendly country" treats him as a "treasure," forcing him to do things against his will!

We must carry out a long-term war of resistance. China will never "perish," but Japan will not "perish" either. What will "perish" is the Japanese fascist military clique, and some cancerous growths that are harmful to our Chinese nation-building!

### Thrift Bicycle Service Society

— Simon

—The Glorious Struggle of Messengers—

Since the fall of Shanghai, the first transportation organization belonging to the Chinese government that the Japanese targeted was the telegraph bureau. Initially, the employees of the telegraph bureau, under severe pressure, were unwilling to lose their integrity, and finally voluntarily disbanded. This is worthy of our admiration.

After the telegraph bureau employees disbanded, some messengers, together with the messengers who withdrew from the International Radio Station, organized a bicycle service society to deliver items for all walks of life, practicing self-reliance. Their struggle and their efforts are worthy of our sympathy and are very glorious.

If someone entrusts the bicycle service society to deliver an item, a phone call will immediately send someone to your door on a bicycle to deliver what you want to send to the address you specify. The labor cost charged is only 15 cents per hour. If it is a gift and the recipient has a gratuity, you don't have to pay extra.

People who are accustomed to sending telegrams are very familiar with the routes, and they are all veterans at riding bicycles, so delivering things is particularly faster than others. On the other hand, in a city like Shanghai, this kind of service is also needed, because many families do not have servants to send gifts or favors, or if you want a special messenger to send a letter, there is no one to send on your behalf, which can be annoying and troublesome.

The bicycle service society was originally on Kaifeng Road. Now, to make the location more convenient, it has moved to No. 4, Yanqing Lane, at the intersection of North Chengdu Road and Shanhai Pass Road. The author has always expressed respect for this group of valiant and unyielding messengers who would rather rely on their own efforts to survive. Therefore, on Saturday afternoon of last week, I made a special trip to Yanqing Lane to visit.

Walking to the entrance of Yanqing Lane, I found a sign with red characters on a white background that read "Thrift Bicycle Service Society." The fourth house in the alley is the address of the bicycle service society. It is an ordinary residential house with more than a dozen bicycles parked at the door, and a sign is also hung on the door. In a living room, there were more than a dozen people, presumably they were all messengers before, and everyone was chatting. One was even playing the erhu, and everyone's face showed a happy expression.

I casually chatted with one of them for a few sentences, and learned that there were dozens of them in total. They deliver items for people every day, serving the public. Although the labor cost they earn is not much, the lives of a group of people can barely be maintained. Everyone who delivers goods has a guarantee, so entrusting them to deliver goods is foolproof. It is said that last time, during the foreign winter solstice and the Gregorian New Year, many people entrusted them to deliver goods and gifts. Now that the lunar New Year is approaching, most families cannot avoid the custom, and everyone wants to give gifts, so these days, the number of people entrusting them to give gifts is increasing day by day. After chatting for a few sentences, I walked out the door, and I had an indescribable respect for the industry of self-reliance. I deeply hope that the people in the city can express their sympathy to them and entrust them to deliver gifts and items.

### Tour Guide Girl

— Yan Hua

"Service De Luxe"

Produced by New Globe, opening at Cathay Theater

"Tour Guide Girl" is not a remarkable film. This is obvious, because from the title, you can imagine what it is like. The story of the entire film, from beginning to end, is the same as all romance films, immersed in an atmosphere of eroticism and humor. These playwrights do not want the audience to receive any inspiration from this "educational weapon." Its highest attempt is only to make the audience laugh loudly during the hour and a half of the screening. In this way, the film can have 100% certainty in business, and these audiences, in these playful love pictures, forget the world and forget society. The anesthetic nature of American films is concretely manifested in these places.

The composition of this film is just as mentioned above. It is very funny and will make people laugh. In this story, the playwright has arranged a total of five characters painted with humorous colors: an engineer, a rich man, but he likes to study cooking; the second is his daughter, a spoiled young lady who wants to fall in love with any man she sees; the third, a former Russian aristocrat, a prince, who works as a cook in the engineer's house; the fourth, the head of a business agency, a shrewd and capable girl; the fifth, a young man who studies machinery. The entire play uses these five people to string together a complex romantic comedy. Here, we cannot but admit that the personalities of these characters are all written vividly and lively; the engineer's daughter, as soon as she sees the young Bob, shows a "love at first sight" look, and has been pursuing him; it is a very cute technique; that "Prince" cook, after announcing that he was the former Russian prince, the engineer's daughter immediately went to pursue him again, and quickly married him. Here, the psychology of a delicate and vanity-admiring girl is fully displayed. As for writing the engineer's confusion, the business agency girl's affection, and the young Bob's simplicity, all make the entire play full of laughter.

Director Roland Lee has a strong grasp of character personality; writing the business agency girl's (Constance Bennett) stubborn personality, when she receives a call from the engineer asking her to prepare the engagement ceremony for the young Bob and the engineer's daughter, she is so angry that she smashes the telephone receiver, cuts off the main line of the telephone, and then walks around the office in extreme anger. Under a fast-paced tone, it not only shows the female protagonist's angry emotions, but also shows the stubborn personality of a shrewd, capable, and competitive girl. As for the engineer's daughter, who falls in love with any man she sees, the lost soul and slow-moving appearance at the business agency cannot but make you laugh; when she pursues the young Bob in the basement, she is again a "little bird dependent on others" and cute. In terms of action and position, it shows its accuracy.

In terms of actors, Constance Bennett's business agency director is very experienced and skilled; this very urban-type actor is very suitable for playing this role; the male lead, Van Heflin, although a newcomer, is very calm; the others, such as Mischa Auer's Russian prince and Charles Ruggles' engineer, are all very funny and lovable.

### Shanghai Children's Magazines in the Past Six Months

— Li Yuyong

Children's magazines are greatly related to national education, but the world often neglects them. This column once published an article "General Review of Shanghai Magazines," which did not mention them, so I would like to supplement this article.

Shanghai's children's magazines were mainly published by various bookstores. After the war, these children's magazines either moved or closed down, and the Shanghai children's magazine scene suddenly became silent. In view of this, various elementary schools collectively launched them. However, taking a single elementary school as a unit, either there was a lack of talent, or the funds were not enough; the attempts failed, or they stopped publishing after one or two issues, or they stopped after more than ten issues, rising and falling one after another. Although I have only been in Shanghai for half a year, I have seen nearly a dozen types of magazines. Their growth and decline are worth recording for reference.

"Shanghai Children's Weekly" was the earliest seen. Each issue was only a thin volume of thirty pages, but the printing was quite good. It stopped after more than twenty issues because the editor re-entered university to study and had no time to edit and proofread.

"Angel Weekly" was very thin, the printing was not good, it had a lot of local materials, and it stopped after a few issues.

"Good Children" Bi-monthly, pocket-sized, focused on social sciences, and was dedicated to publishing children's works. After a few issues, it was renamed "Children's Reading Materials," increased the size, paid for the content, and focused on adult works. Cartoons and illustrations were the characteristics of this publication.

"Little Master" Weekly, the content was all short and pithy works, printed on wood-free paper, but unfortunately it stopped after more than ten issues.

"Children's Paradise" Weekly, pocket-sized, stopped after a few issues.

"New Children" Weekly, the content was very thin, the print run was not large, it was not easy to buy, and the distribution of materials was quite even.

"Good Friends" was run by some editors of "Shanghai Children," but the style was different from "Shanghai Children." It focused on social and musical works. Except for the recently opened news briefs, Q&A, and good friend photos sections, there was nothing else to recommend.

"Little Youth" Weekly, was the most beautiful in form among all the publications. The version was entirely modeled after "Little Friends," and the materials were all of great interest. Unfortunately, it is no longer published now. It is not known whether it has been suspended or temporarily suspended for vacation.

"Children" is a publication close to the "Family" category. The content includes old-style novels and old-style illustrations, and there are many advertisements. It is the most old-fashioned among all the publications.

Unofficial children's publications include "Children's Paradise," "Glow," and "Olive."

Although there are many children in Shanghai, the sales of each publication are not good. It is not possible to force students to subscribe or hire famous educators as special contributors. From this, we can also know the difficulty of its creation. It can be seen that most publications are typeset in No. 5 font, and only "Little Master" and "Little Youth" use No. 4 font. It is no wonder that there is no successor to children's books and newspapers after the war.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 4: Tracing Past Events, Le Tian Conveys Wonderful Words; Establishing New Friendship, Scenic Spot Makes Pure Tour

The seats in the train now are only first class. There is no such thing as first class, second class, or third class, let alone fourth class military. However, the price is cheaper than before, and the seats are more comfortable. But this refers to short-distance trains that do not require overnight stays on the train. If it is a long-distance train that requires sleeping car facilities on the train, then that is another matter. Now, the two Miss He, along with Mr. Wu Junsu, boarded the train, but found that the train was already full of people, but the order was very good. They were all sitting side by side on a chair, and there was a small table in the middle. According to the current situation, it is impossible for people who bought tickets to not get a seat on the train and have to stand there. If this situation happens again, it is the dereliction of duty of the railway bureau and the poor management of the executors, and they should be punished. Why? First, let me talk about selling tickets. Selling tickets is based on the number of seats on the train. This time, it is determined how many cars are towed and how many seats each car has. It is not like the unrestricted situation in the past. In the third and fourth class cars, people were crammed in as if they were in pig cars. Some did not have seats and sat on their luggage; some stood all the way from Shanghai Station to Wuxi; some were too crowded, the car doors did not open, and they were squeezed in from the windows; some women in the inland bound their small feet, but they had many children, carrying one and dragging a group, and were staggering without seats. But if you go to the first-class carriage, you can see that the glass doors are tightly closed, the silk curtains are pulled together, and people are stretching their waists and legs on the soft leather sofas, dozing off. Or they are with their delicate lovers, leaning on jade and caressing fragrance. Moreover, in the carriage, it is stipulated that two people sit on one chair, and it is not allowed for one person to occupy two seats. If this is the case, someone will say that he does not care about public morality and looks down on him, and he himself will feel embarrassed. Today, the two Miss He, along with Wu Junsu, arrived in the carriage. They chose three empty seats to sit down. Coincidentally, there was a chair that was empty and unoccupied. Junsu asked the two ladies to sit down and went to find another seat himself. But opposite them were two men, one who was already old, about fifty years old. The other was a wounded soldier with only one leg, leaning on two wooden crutches, but he had a medal of honor hanging on his chest. When Wu Junsu saw this wounded veteran of honor, he immediately stood at attention and gave a salute. When the two Miss He saw this, they also immediately saluted. This is the recent post-war custom. Whenever people see wounded soldiers on the road or in public places, everyone salutes them. (38)

### Refugee Production Education

— Mao Lie

Relieving refugees is the responsibility that everyone who is not a refugee should bear. Because the creation of refugees has a special significance, our relief to them cannot be compared with general charitable acts.

For more than a year, the relief effort cannot be said to have achieved considerable results, but because it is biased towards relief, it is inevitably only effective in the negative aspect, not only is it difficult to sustain, but it also loses the opportunity for positive use. Now the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association is starting to raise "Refugee Production Education Fund", this is really the urgent matter! Only by giving refugees production education, refugees will not become dependent, and become starved after leaving the refugee camp. As for having such education, during the period of continuous resistance, cultivating their ability to be self-reliant, and no longer need to rely on relief, that is of course an especially pressing need.

Now this fund movement has been scheduled to start from the education community on the 18th of this month. There are "150,000 elementary school students, 10,000 middle school students, and 50,000 university students and supplementary school students" in the city. I think this amount of 100,000 yuan will always be easy to raise, right? If the faculty and staff of each school can see the importance of this movement and do their best to support it. As for the students, it is still considered fortunate to be able to live and study in peace in such times. Save some of the expenses of the abolished Lunar New Year and make this meaningful donation, I think everyone will be happy to do so.

Of course, this movement should be promoted to all walks of life. I think the business community will surely rise up when they hear the news, and will not let the education community monopolize the beauty in front. At that time, with the collective efforts of the group, we will be able to solve this refugee problem once and for all.

In short, everyone who is not a refugee should have a deeper understanding: there is a close relationship between refugees and us; donating to the refugee production education fund is not just for pitying the refugees' difficulties, nor is it just for accumulating good fortune and planting good deeds to seek good rewards, but it is our responsibility in the War of Resistance. I hope everyone will donate generously and contribute enthusiastically.

### Liujiatan

— Ping Hen

The reeds of Liujiatan have been cut, leaving behind extremely short roots. If a strong wind rises, the waves in the pond always want to submerge them; but when the wind stops, the water is still water, and the reed roots are still reed roots.

Every day, as usual, a fishing boat stops on the shore of Liujiatan. And every day, as usual, two or three soldiers in yellow uniforms always circle around the place where the fishing boat stops in Liujiatan.

It was already late this day, and the sun was about to climb to the middle of the sky. The fishing boat was swaying on the ripples of Liujiatan. An old man, bending forward and backward, was rowing the oars, and the boat slowly approached the shore. Strangely enough, a soldier in a yellow uniform had long been standing at the place where the fishing boat stopped every day. Seeing the fishing boat rowing from the pond waves, a joyful look appeared on his face.

As soon as the fishing boat approached the shore of the pond, the soldier in the yellow uniform immediately jumped onto the boat, looking around on the boat with sharp eyes for a while. The joyful face was temporarily replaced by a dead look; he looked at the fisherman rowing the oars, and the fisherman also looked at him - the soldier in the yellow uniform.

"You," the soldier in the yellow uniform pointed at the fisherman, and made gestures for something long, wide, able to jump, and in the water, and then said, "Do you have any?"

"Yes," the fisherman lifted the hatch board under his feet. Some water was poured inside, and you could see four or five carp in the water cabin. When the soldier in the yellow uniform saw this, he changed back to his original joyful look.

The soldier in the yellow uniform crossed from the front cabin of the boat to the fisherman, squatted down his short body, picked up the carp in the cabin with his hand, raised his head and looked at the fisherman's face and said, "Xin Jiao, Xin Jiao," and continued to tie them together, one, two, three... with a rope. The fisherman looked at him, understood the smile in his heart, gently swayed the oar in his hand, and the fishing boat left the shore.

The fishing boat was more than two feet away from the shore. The soldier in the yellow uniform was still busy tying the fish, not knowing that the boat was close to the center of the pond. The fisherman looked at the shore and saw that there was no second soldier in a yellow uniform. He clenched his teeth, used the strength of throwing the fishing net, lifted the strange soldier squatting on the boat, and threw him into the water. The fish and the soldier went down to Liujiatan together. Extremely large waves rose on the water surface, and the fishing boat was constantly tossing.

When the fisherman saw that the water was calm, he smiled and rowed the boat away from Liujiatan.

The wind rose again, blowing up huge waves, rolling over the reed roots, and splashing white water flowers. Liujiatan is often like this: when the wind stops, the water is still water, and the reed roots are still reed roots. But this time, something yellow floated up, half on the reed roots and half in the water.

Since that day, the fishing boat in Liujiatan has not been found. The soldier in the yellow uniform on the shore could not be seen either.

### Dai Cangqi

### Soldier's Song

— Yang Jinzhen

Flowers

The woods are cover,

My right hand crosses my partner,

Stealthily sneaking.

Withered flowers, under my straw sandals,

Gently cuddling the messy withered grass.

Should have been abused by violence!

Should have been trampled by iron hooves?

Do you have any markings,

Marking out the traces of the enemy?

That light red face,

Is it the blood of brothers?

Do not shrink or hesitate,

The motherland's artillery fire will give you moisture,

Grow strong!

Sprout a brilliant victory.

### Miscellaneous Talk: "Self-Praise"

— Douqin

I don't know who said the phrase, "Scholars are prone to boasting." This is indeed true; scholars do tend to exaggerate a bit.

Let's not talk about things too far back, but just the Qing Dynasty. Yuan Mei was a well-known boaster. He even said that a thief went to steal from a wealthy family, saw a copy of "The Complete Works of Suiyuan," and took nothing else, only carrying off the book. The story sounds nice, of course, but it's really hard to believe. However, even though Yuan Mei told such tall tales, he still made them interesting. Some people, however, are too lazy to even make it interesting. For example, Jin Nong, who was roughly contemporary with Yuan Mei, once used a purely advertising-style method: in the preface to his "Winter Heart Continued Collection," he listed all the praises he had heard from famous people about him since he was a child. Whether those words were true or not, of course, no one investigated.

However, no matter how much you boast, you still need to have some real substance. No matter how much you advertise, you still need to produce some goods. Yuan Mei was, after all, a scholar of his generation, and Jin Nong was, after all, an artist of his generation. The reason is that, in addition to boasting, they also had a genuine side.

If you don't believe it, consider a writer from Shanghai a few years ago: he ran his own publication and printed his own works. The publication featured a "Collection of Praises," a full page of cheers. The works were attached with "Excerpts from Letters," also a full page of cheers. And the preface to his poetry collection openly stated that someone exclaimed "Truly good!" when reading his poems, and another person exclaimed "Truly good!" when reading his poems, and this someone and that someone met and exclaimed in unison "Truly good!" Naturally, it did stir up the literary scene a bit, but the result was that the writer quietly left the literary scene and was never seen again.

The reason was that he had no substance. Without substance and only advertising, business is bound to fail.

This situation is no different in behaviors outside of literature.

Let's talk about something a little further back this time. Wen Tianxiang was a politician, but he also seemed to like playing the role of a scholar. He wrote the "Song of Righteousness," putting himself on par with great figures in history. The air of self-praise can't be said to be anything less than complete. But he himself, after all, died in a Mongol prison for the sake of the Song Dynasty. The reason why the "Song of Righteousness" can be recited to this day is because it unambiguously represents the author's genuine side. Zhang Huangyan was a more recent figure. He was also a politician, but he liked to write poetry and essays just as much. Judging from his surviving works, he was even more like a scholar than Wen Tianxiang. He was very good at expressing himself, and his tone was quite grand. However, despite that, we don't dislike his exaggerations when we read his works. The reason is that he himself was truly fighting for the Ming Dynasty, and he refused to surrender to the Manchu Qing to the very end.

It still comes down to the substance. A little exaggeration is fine; the main thing is whether you're actually deceiving people.

Zheng Xiaoxu also constantly wrote poems, saying that he loved his country and wanted to save it, but in the end, he was just writing poems for the sake of writing poems, becoming a complete braggart. Zhang ×× also patted his chest in Beijing and said that "the Zhang family" would never do anything to betray the country. A scholar acting like a hero did make people's eyes widen for a moment, but later everyone shook their heads. Zhou ×× also put himself on par with great figures in history, saying that everyone should regard him as Su Wu, but soon a young man went to Su Wu's home and fired a shot.

"I have a spirit of sacrifice!" "I'm doing this for the sake of the nation, even if it means facing great difficulties!" "You may scold me now, but you'll eventually know that I am passionately devoted to the nation!" … Saying such things in a string, one might think it's interesting, but if the current reality is completely the opposite, even with a smiling face or tearful sobs, this "interesting" thing can only make people feel disgusted.

"Mistaking disgust for interest" is certainly possible, but in the end, it can't hold people back.

It's very simple: no one wants to be covered in goosebumps!

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

"I'll go to the front to see how the brothers are building the defenses," said Battalion Commander Ye, and he was about to run outside.

"Aren't you going to disguise yourself?" Liang Guofu reminded him.

Battalion Commander Ye smiled, casually picked up some bamboo branches and rice straw from the ground, and tied them to his military cap. Before he could finish tying them, suddenly, the heavy artillery roared a few times with a "boom, boom," shaking the walls of the thatched cottage.

"They're attacking!" Staff Officer Zhu stood up calmly, handed the signed orders to Battalion Commander Ye for review. Battalion Commander Ye looked at them and then ordered the orderly to distribute them, and walked out of the thatched cottage with Liang Guofu and Staff Officer Zhu.

The heavy artillery continued to roar. Standing on a high point and looking east, they saw that the artillery fire had dyed half the sky red along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line. The shells flew like fireballs in the air, bright and green. Some exploded in the air, while others exploded only after landing on the ground. Battalion Commander Ye looked through his binoculars for a long time and couldn't help but frown and say:

"The enemy's artillery fire is so fierce that rushing forward can only lead to pointless sacrifices. Even to defend, we have to see if our defenses are strong enough. I'm going to inspect the defense line now. If the battle gets close, I'll stay there to command and won't come back."

Saying this, without waiting for the two people beside him to reply, he ran forward. A large expanse of fertile plains, fields, woods, small bridges, and flowing water made up this beautiful landscape painting of a Jiangnan village, but now it was all destroyed by war, and it might be ravaged by demonic hands in the near future. When Battalion Commander Ye thought of this, his heart burned with the desire to defend his homeland. He ran to the front line in one breath. Most of the trenches had already been dug. Engineers were busy building defenses with newly felled trees, barbed wire, burlap sacks, sandbags, etc., while laying military telephone lines. In a corner of the trench, he met Zhao Desheng, the battalion commander leading the most elite First Battalion of the entire regiment. Battalion Commander Zhao's dark face was filled with a radiant smile. He greeted Battalion Commander Ye with a military salute and said proudly:

"Reporting to the Battalion Commander, we are all prepared and are just waiting for the enemy to invade. If they can't attack today, we can build our fortifications even stronger."

"The enemy may attack here at sunset. We must not be careless," said Battalion Commander Ye solemnly. Then he asked: "Where is the artillery position?"

"Our artillery position is very well placed. No matter how hard the enemy's planes try, they won't find it," said Battalion Commander Zhao confidently, and then led Battalion Commander Ye to inspect the artillery position. Sure enough, the artillery position was cleverly placed. Two heavy artillery pieces were deeply hidden in the dense foliage of the trees, and an anti-aircraft gun was placed next to the bamboo forest, with bamboo branches tied to the muzzle, like a slender bamboo plant.

Battalion Commander Ye looked at it for a while and was very satisfied. Just then, Artillery Company Commander Xiao Guangyi was nearby, so he asked him: "Have you calculated the range?"

"It's calculated. This is one hundred yards away from our defense line, and the artillery fire range can reach two hundred and fifty yards away."

At this moment, a very loud sound of wings beating in the sky was heard. A squadron of about twelve enemy planes flew quickly towards the defense line, as usual, two fighter planes protecting one bomber. Company Commander Xiao's face changed, and he ran and jumped towards the anti-aircraft gun position. Battalion Commander Ye and Battalion Commander Zhao also followed closely. Before they could get close, the anti-aircraft gun was already roaring "bang, bang." (To be continued)

### Talking About "Short Films" (Part 1)

— Xin Liang

When you go to see foreign films, you must often see short films such as cartoons, newsreels, and musicals before the main feature is shown! Of course, your purpose in going to the cinema is to see the feature film. But in recent years, the confrontation between short films and feature films has been an undeniable fact.

Short films have several characteristics, such as economical performance time, accurate production, and universal themes, which feature films cannot match. Therefore, it is not a lie to say that many people are welcoming these short films. Just look at the times when cinemas are showing Mickey Mouse festivals, and you can see that this is true. Some countries in Europe and the United States even have cinemas that specialize in showing short films!

Let me talk about the nature of various short films here!

News short films—we encounter them most often. It is a living record of our daily lives. The photographers who shoot these short films must have broad knowledge, superb skills, and a brave and alert spirit in order to cope with ease, because there are often difficulties that will come to them. Just like recently, Mr. Wang Xiaoting, a China-based photographic reporter for Hearst News Films in the United States, almost lost his life in order to capture the film of the Japanese atrocities in China, which can make us know that they are supplying us with real news under the threat of the god of death. The most valuable of the short films is this kind of news film. It can not only present President Roosevelt's speeches, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini's military reviews, the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor... etc. in great detail and vividly in front of us, but also, it can make a kind of indelible iron evidence of various important events (such as the sinking of the American Panay gunboat by Japanese aircraft). Because it is so moving and real, almost everyone likes to watch this kind of short film.

Random Anecdotes

### Recording the Reason Why Yang Baozhong Helped Ma Lianliang

— Peiqin

Yang Baozhong, a star. Ma Lianliang, also a star. Although it used to happen that stars would help other stars by playing the erhu, Yang Baozhong's voice was not so damaged that he couldn't sing any opera at all. Before, people like Sun Yiyun changed careers because they were old, so there was some reason. Yang and Ma joining together has a separate background.

Let me talk about Ma Lianliang's side first. When he first came to Shanghai to sing at the Yi Stage, he stubbornly used Hu Ziyuan, and it was always him later. Once, Lianliang and Huang Guiqiu came together. Guiqiu's erhu player was called Zhao Guiyuan, who used to play with Wang Youchen. At that time, Ma Lianliang found Hu Ziyuan's always out-of-tune strings (that is, the outer string was higher than the prescribed sound, and Sun Zuochen also made this mistake) really hard to listen to. Lianliang repeatedly advised him, but he couldn't change. At that time, Zhao Guiyuan, because of the same place, first got the chance to get close. Once in Peiping, he snatched Hu Ziyuan's job. For several years, there was peace, so how did they break up? There are three reasons: First, at a party in Peiping, Zhao Guiyuan dropped the erhu on the ground. Lianliang was singing the long singing passage of "Advise Your Majesty Not to Utter the Word Kill." Lianliang's anger was really extraordinary. Second, it was Lianliang's father's birthday. After the banquet, Zhao Guiyuan said: "How can this kind of dish be for people to eat?" Could this talk sound good to Lianliang? Third, Lianliang's newly married second wife naturally didn't know that Zhao Guiyuan had ever discussed opera with him. He treated him like an ordinary erhu player. One day, after practicing his voice, his second wife said to Zhao Guiyuan: "Have you mastered the tunes? Don't make mistakes later." Guiyuan said: "I can't master them. Otherwise, let the boss change someone to play!" At that time, Lianliang remembered everything in his heart, but there was nothing he could do!

Yang Baozhong was indeed a top student of Yu Shuyan. Although he wasn't as popular as Tan Fuying and Ma Lianliang, he was indeed better than them at singing a few sentences. However, his voice was never loud. He also never really stood out. Baozhong was extremely smart. He wanted to learn everything. He could sing both foreign songs and Chinese songs. He could also play the violin a bit, and he could also play the sihu in the drum tune. He especially liked to play the erhu. Not to say how good he was, but there were few people who could play as well as him. Both the North and the South knew that he was good at the erhu. In 1934, he often played the erhu with the students of the opera school at the Jixiang Theater in the Dong'an Market in Peiping. When he appeared, there were more people holding the erhu than people holding the singer. Baozhong was very proud. Although he was an opera singer, he was still an amateur when it came to the erhu. This kind of behavior can only be seen as him being an amateur. One day, he met Wang Shaoqing. At that time, Wang Shaoqing told him not to show off his erhu skills anymore. He said to Shizhong: "This is not the job for you. It's best to show off less in the future." These words were indeed sincere, but Baozhong thought that he looked down on him and didn't have the ability to make a living on stage, so he decided to change careers and also became a student of Xi Zigang. Lianliang's side, someone knew, so he secretly asked someone to invite him. Lianliang thought it couldn't be done, but who knew it would be done with just one word. It was made clear that each opera was 30 yuan, one opera counted as one opera, as if a three-year contract was signed. Baozhong was also very happy, and Lianliang was even more proud. From then on, he asked Zhao Guiyuan to leave.

### The Successor of "Warner Oland"

After Warner Oland, who specialized in portraying "Charlie Chan," passed away, the 20th Century Fox Company has now found a new actor, named Sidney Toler, whose appearance is similar to Warner. He will continue to play the role of "Charlie Chan." His first film, "Charlie Chan in Honolulu," will soon be released in Shanghai. The picture is a recent photo of the new character "Toler."

### Encouraging Anti-Japanese Sentiment: A Record of the Touring Drama Troupe in the War Zone of Northern Jiangsu

Now that the all-out war of resistance has entered a new stage, it is especially important to inspire and encourage the emotions of the people. There is Qin Kunshan, the former president of the Gengxin Stage in Nanjing, and more than 20 people, including Qin Qiaoling, who are touring and have been performing in Huaiyin, Northern Jiangsu, for more than a month. Recently, they organized a traveling theater troupe in the war zone of northern Jiangsu and went to various counties to perform publicly. Ten percent of the ticket money they made each month was handed over to the local county government for transfer to the provincial government for unified distribution, so as to enrich the strength of the war of resistance, and was submitted to the military and political authorities for the record. The General Political Training Department also sent personnel to guide them. This is truly a good phenomenon for promoting national sentiment.

### Mr. Shang Shouzhong's Longevity Painting

— Junmei

The day before Laba Festival was Shang Qixia (Xiaoyun)'s fortieth birthday. The theatrical world of the old capital, in an extremely desolate situation, suddenly saw excitement. Although it was only a fleeting moment, with beacon fires on all sides and the year rapidly declining, it was enough to add some embellishment. Recently, I received a letter from a friend in Peiping, mentioning the two hundred longevity paintings in Shang's birthday celebration, which are extremely unique. I will transcribe them to provide material for conversation.

Shang's birthday celebration can be called an unprecedented initiative in the theatrical world. On that day, from morning to night, the streets of Baozi were crowded with carriages and horses. The lively situation was rare in recent years. More than 300 tables were used for the banquet, and the theater provided more than 2,000 seats. All the students of the Rongchun Society performed 16 operas together to entertain the guests. What is most valuable is that all the students sang a hundred longevity paintings. When singing, the whole group sang together, like singing in school, or like monks chanting sutras. The melody was melodious and harmonious, and extremely pleasant to listen to. All the guests applauded and praised it, which is a rare spectacle in a birthday celebration.

The second is the new hundred longevity painting presented by Ma Lianliang as a birthday screen. The original words said, "In the auspicious time on the seventh day of the twelfth month of the year Wuyin, I am happy to meet Brother Qixia's fortieth birthday celebration. Little brother Lianliang came to wish you a long life and specially sang a new hundred longevity painting to congratulate you on your thousand years. Brother Qi, please don't laugh at me for praising and praying well. After saying that, I celebrated. When the God of Longevity heard this, he came to Fangxin Studio and respectfully presented the birthday greetings, but he only saw the Antarctic Immortal full of joy. I sent Brother a hundred longevity paintings to hang in the birthday hall, and took advantage of the hundred sons' picture to raise their glasses together. The Eight Immortals offered golden cakes and jade syrup, and the Queen Mother showed up at the Peach Banquet. I wish Brother great wealth, honor and longevity, and I congratulate Brother on having many sons and adding luster to his long spring; I wish Brother a glorious term as our president; I congratulate Brother Rongchun Society for filling every venue; I wish Brother leads the crowd with heroic spirit and charisma; I congratulate Brother and his virtuous wife, Liang Meng, for being happy, peaceful, and healthy." The wording is simple and does not depart from the nature of an actor, and it is also a unique aspect of birthday celebration writing.

### Secret History of the Palace and the Theatrical World of the Old Capital (104)

— Xu Muyun

The hobbies of actors for eating, drinking, gambling, and playing with birds, animals, insects, and fish, etc.

Eating, drinking, and gambling are the hobbies of ordinary people. Actors, except for extremely avoiding the third kind of hobby, "prostitution," have almost the same love for various other hobbies as people of all levels of society. Slightly famous stars all hire one or two famous chefs at home to prepare some delicacies for their daily chewing. Therefore, nine out of ten opera singers like to study eating. When it comes to the word drinking, according to the psychology of outsiders, they always think that they love their voices the most (the voice is their capital) and will never drink excessive amounts of alcohol to damage their precious voices. In fact, this is worrying about them too much. He Guishan, Yu Jusheng, Wang Yufang, Chen Delin, Qiu Guixian, Li Baisui in the past, and Cheng Yanqiu, Ma Fulu, Wang Shaolou, and Li Duokui, etc. now all have extremely large drinking capacities. When it comes to yellow wine, I am afraid that everyone has a drinking capacity of four or five jin. Uncle Nine of the Eyebrows (Yufang) is already 70 years old. However, when I and Mr. Su Shaoqing banqueted him every week (during the Republic of China years 8 and 9, several enthusiasts invited Mr. Wang to talk about opera, in addition to paying monthly remuneration, and also having a public banquet once a week), he was still able to drink five or six jin of yellow wine, and after drinking, he would sing one or two excerpts in a louder voice. From this, it can be seen that there are also many actors who like to drink. Regarding the matter of gambling, in addition to playing small cards as daily entertainment, it is feared that there are not many people in the old capital's theatrical world who gamble heavily like a certain Shanghai star who indulged in gambling dens and spent thousands of gold at a time. Among them, there is only one Yan Jupeng, who lost three or four thousand gold for public bonds over the years, completely losing all his savings for many years. Therefore, whenever he talks to people about this matter, he often jokes and says, "I am an amateur who went to sea, and insiders say that I have no teacher; in fact, I do have a teacher, and I am also very filial to my teacher. No matter how much money I have, I give it to him." Others were very surprised and asked him, "So, who is the honorable teacher of Third Master Yan?" He replied with a bitter smile on his face, "My humble teacher is 'Public Bonds'!" The others also laughed. Besides Jupeng, there are also Xu Biyun and Xun Huisheng, who relatively like to play pai gow (Northerners call it eating dog meat) with slightly larger wins and losses. Besides them, I have not heard of any other existing actors who are more fond of gambling than these three.

### Li Junpan's Compiled Detective Movie Script

— Bu Jie

If we are to strictly talk about Green Treasure Theater's success of today, then of course we must promote several people from the screenplay section. And Li Junpan is one of the strong generals of the Green Treasure Screenplay Front. For example, the previously performed "Modern Girl," "Demons," "Mother's Secret," and "After Losing Love" at Green Treasure were all Li Junpan's heartfelt works. With his rich literary skills, plus the thirty years of drama experience gained in the field, it is appropriate that those screenplays gave Green Treasure excellent selling opportunities. This made all the audience issue awards to Green Treasure for this reason.

However, Li Junpan is after all an old man with white hair. Although he is loyal to dramatic art and not afraid of all sacrifices, an old man's spirit cannot withstand excessive fatigue. Therefore, since he was employed by Green Treasure, because he had to write at least one or two screenplays per month, this rigid and heavy work was like a yoke that bound his freedom, making him gradually feel tired.

According to Li Junpan, "In order to make each screenplay appear rigorous in structure, in order to make each line seem light and interesting, except for sleep time, almost every day's time is immersed in thoughts; even sometimes, I am disturbed in my dreams for all of this! These words are real, and the ten pounds of weight loss that has continued is his only proof.

Because of the above reasons, he recently voluntarily resigned from the Green Treasure authorities, intending to take a break from this. Although Green Treasure retained him in many ways, they could not dispel his intention to resign. So these days Li Junpan is like a free man who has broken free from his shackles. New vitality has swept away the previous silence, and happiness surrounds him; every day he lies on the sofa, smokes a few Red Sister brand cigarettes, and tells interesting stories to his children and grandchildren, with laughter filling the whole room.

But, Li Junpan lives for art, and during his temporary rest he still cannot forget how to work for the future. However, he does not want to return to the drama world. At this time, Xu Xinyuan, who appeared as the Chinese Charlie Chan, was ordered by Xu Xinfu, the authoritative director of detective films, to ask him to compile a detective screenplay, so as to connect Xu Xinfu's consistent style throughout. He naturally felt interested in this request, and he agreed without hesitation.

In this way, in order to make his screenplays have surprising plots, he began to read detective novels, and he also took time every day to sit in the theater showing detective films for two hours, and he referred to this time to make his own mirror.

Now, the story of the detective screenplay has been completed. The general idea is that a conspirator wants to kill the only son of a wealthy family, but he knows that the only son is actually kidnapped by kidnappers. So a suspicious case has to go through two layers of relationships, and in the end it can only rely on Charlie Chan to reveal the inside story.

The plot is indeed bizarre, and it is bizarre in such a reasonable way.

In the future, his second step is to divide the scenes. He said that he will use a free and unrestrained mood to complete this masterpiece; therefore, if someone encounters him, he will not hesitate to spend some time telling you the story of the process and asking the other party for their opinion on the content.

According to this draw, the old manuals do not record it, so there is no fixed sequence of moves. There are three key points: You cannot directly face the chariot. The horse cannot leave the sixth and eighth files. The advance, retreat, and horizontal movement of the chariot must be carefully considered in light of the opponent's intentions, and then adapt to the situation. One must not be careless. Now, the most important moves are extracted and compiled into a rough outline for joint study.
