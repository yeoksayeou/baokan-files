### Grue Ambassador Warns Japan: The United States is Determined to Uphold its Rights in China, Sternly Rejecting Japan's So-called 'New Order in East Asia'. Atrocities by Japanese Troops Deeply Abhorred by the American Government and Public

Tokyo - American Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grue, during a luncheon hosted by the America-Japan Society this afternoon, provided a frank explanation of the relationship between the United States and Japan. The core of his statement was, "The American people are determined to safeguard their long-established rights in China." Grue had recently returned from the United States, and no fewer than seven hundred dignitaries attended the luncheon to hear his remarks. The American ambassador, after stating that he did not wish to dwell on trivial matters to bore his audience, said, "I believe there is no one here who is unaware that American public opinion is greatly dissatisfied with certain actions of the Japanese military in China today, such as infringing upon the rights and legitimate interests of Americans in China." He continued, stating that these facts were well-known by both the American government and public, and that for the sake of future interests between Japan and the United States, such matters must be addressed. Unless constructive steps are taken to change this situation, how can relations between the two countries improve? Grue further stated that Americans believe in equal commercial opportunities throughout the world. While Japan demands and benefits from the Open Door policy in regions outside of China, in China it claims that this principle is not applicable. Even if there are exceptions, they are merely incomplete and lifeless formalities. Grue also said that the Japanese side often accuses the American government and public of not understanding the "New Order in East Asia." In reality, the American government and public understand the meaning of this new order as clearly and precisely as Japan does. Japanese officials explain this "New Order" as an order of security, stability, and progress, which is what the American government and public desire not only for themselves but for all countries in the world. However, this "New Order in East Asia" apparently seeks to exclude the long-established rights and interests of Americans in China, which is what the American people oppose. The American ambassador concluded by stating that his views accurately represent and convey the general sentiment of the American government and public. American public opinion regarding recent developments in the Far East is nearly unanimous, based on facts rather than propaganda. This nationwide consensus is a force that the American government cannot ignore and will ultimately reflect in its policies and actions.

After strongly asserting that the American people are increasingly disgusted with the methods employed by the Japanese military in China, the ambassador continued, stating that Americans are deeply shocked by Japan's indiscriminate bombing. The reason for the shock in American public opinion is not only for humanitarian reasons but also because it directly endangers the lives and property of Americans, causing Americans to lose their lives and become disabled. Americans have become increasingly concerned about the Japanese military in China disregarding treaties and agreements signed by several nations, including Japan, and infringing upon and interfering with American rights. Americans not only feel troubled by the deprivation of their deeply rooted rights, such as equal opportunity and fair treatment, but also feel that the current trend in the Far East, if it continues unabated, will shatter their hopes for the development of an orderly world. The American ambassador continued, stating that American interests in China are currently being damaged and undermined by the policies and actions of the Japanese authorities in China. American property is being damaged daily, and American expatriates are being placed in danger and insulted. If I were to provide a detailed account of the above matters, you would undoubtedly feel that the attitude held by Americans is steady and fully justified. In short, the American people, based on the reliable evidence they have obtained, have ample reason to believe that Japan, for its own benefit, is currently striving to establish control over a vast area of the Asian continent and to implement a closed economic system in that area. The aforementioned situation, coupled with the bombing, insults, and various interferences with American rights, is the reason for the attitude of the American people towards Japan today. It is my belief, and the belief of the American government and people, that many of the harmful incidents inflicted by Japanese personnel on America are entirely unnecessary. We firmly believe that the true security and stability of the Far East can only be achieved without violating any American rights. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)

### Welcomed by People in Chongqing

Chongqing - People from all walks of life here in China have welcomed the speech delivered by American Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grue, in Tokyo, stating that its content frankly clarifies the policy and attitude of the United States in the Far East. It also provides Japanese people with an opportunity to hear the candid opinions of foreigners regarding the actions of the Japanese military in China and the world's opinion on various activities of Japan in China. Ambassador Grue's speech has aroused widespread commentary and left a very good impression among the Chinese people. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)

### Negative Reactions from Japanese Newspapers

Tokyo - Today, various newspapers here criticized the speech by American Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grue, regarding the attitude of the United States towards Japan's policy in China. "Chugai Commercial News" criticized the American ambassador's speech, stating that this formal expression of American views proves that the United States is resolutely and decisively opposing Japan's position and determination to build a new order in East Asia, betting the fate of the nation on it, both formally and substantially. "Asahi Shimbun" stated that while the "frankness" of the American ambassador's speech is commendable, the prejudices and misunderstandings in American public opinion urgently need to be frankly corrected. "Miyako Shimbun" stated that Japan is firmly determined to advance and fulfill its lofty mission of building a new order in East Asia, regardless of American public opinion. "Kokumin Shimbun" strongly asserted that it would be foolish to be intimidated by American public opinion. The Japanese government should assess the situation between the United States and Japan based on the true circumstances and promote the construction of the new order in East Asia. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)

### Rumors of a Sino-Soviet Alliance: Purely Japanese Propaganda

Chongqing - Well-informed Chinese sources from all walks of life stated that rumors circulating abroad that China and the Soviet Union are about to conclude a military agreement and that the Soviet Union is stationing troops in Xinjiang are Japanese propaganda. These rumors were carefully crafted by the Japanese to shake British policy in the Far East and were spread opportunely just before and after the arrival of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr in Chongqing. The timing was particularly clever. The Japanese also spread rumors that the British ambassador is currently urging the National Government to peacefully resolve the Sino-Japanese conflict. This is the ultimate goal of this Japanese propaganda. Seeing that their plan has failed, that Britain is unwilling to act as a mediator, and that it cannot pressure China to negotiate with Japan, they are now trying to intimidate Britain with rumors that the Soviet Union is about to control China. Therefore, the Japanese are currently broadcasting rumors that China and the Soviet Union are about to conclude a military agreement and that Soviet troops are concentrating in Xinjiang, attempting to force China to accept their demands. The Japanese hope to use this to arouse the concern of the great powers about the expansion of Soviet power in China and pressure the National Government to make peace with Japan in order to eliminate the possibility of the Soviet Union gaining control in China. According to well-informed observers, everything Japan has been doing in China has completely failed. Therefore, they are racking their brains to create rumors in order to bring the Sino-Japanese war to an early end. (Reuter's dispatch, [Day unclear])

Washington - Officials in Washington yesterday declined to comment on reports from Chinese sources that China and the Soviet Union may sign a military alliance. According to the report, a Soviet military delegation arrived in Chongqing this week for the purpose of negotiating a military alliance between the two countries. However, well-informed sources here believe that the mission of the Soviet military delegation to China will be largely limited to the role of military advisors. Some believe that China and the Soviet Union may negotiate an agreement stipulating that the Soviet Union will supply goods to China, but they doubt that the two countries will soon conclude a full military alliance. Observers here believe that a Sino-Soviet military agreement would be a major factor in future Anglo-Japanese relations. It is said that Britain and Japan have been considering the new relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany. It is generally believed that if Soviet economic aid to Germany hinders the effectiveness of the British blockade of Germany, then Britain will attempt to move closer to Japan. However, most observers doubt that any new development can cause the United States or Britain to reduce their sympathy towards China. American public opinion towards the Soviet Union is wavering due to two different problems. The eastern states express strong sympathy for the Baltic and North Sea states and therefore want to resist Soviet aggression, but the western states are influenced by the Soviet Union's attitude, believing that the Soviet Union can resist Japan's expansion. (Associated Press dispatch, 20th)

### Sino-Soviet Relations Difficult to Improve: Rumors of New Clashes on the Mongolian Border

The Hague - It is reported that Soviet and Japanese troops have once again engaged in hostilities on the Manchurian-Mongolian border. Observers here are all surprised by this. "Handelsblad" also published an editorial, stating, "The truce agreement on the Manchurian-Mongolian border signed by the Soviet Union and Japan on the 8th of this month has now become invalid. This was not what most people expected. It can be seen from this that all the disputes between the two countries have not been resolved. Here, we cannot help but ask: Did the Soviet Union sign the truce agreement in order to delay time so that it could consolidate its position in Europe? Will it now actively develop in the Far East, driving the Japanese forces eastward, just as it is driving the German forces westward in Europe? In other words, will the Soviet Union actively assist China, forcing Japan to surrender, and thereby seek to gain leadership in Asian politics? In short, it can be asserted that the current actions of the Soviet Union have focused on the Far East." (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### The Netherlands Strengthens Far East Defenses: Adds Aircraft and Warships

Editorial

### British Military Preparations in the Far East

The situation facing Britain today is quite different from that during the last Great War. The fires of war in the Far East ignited two years ago. While the friend who previously served as her Far Eastern "watchdog" is now betting everything on military action on the Asian continent, her mind is still focused on how to strike at British power in order to fulfill her dream of dominating Asia. How to realize her ambition to advance south, so that she can occupy a place in the resource-rich South Seas to compensate for her inherent economic deficiencies. Therefore, Britain has her direct enemy, Germany, in Europe, and another hostile force in Asia. This force is currently bogged down in China, and although its piecemeal looting and oppression cause Britain some losses, it does not pose a major threat to Britain. However, its consistent policy of aggression and its concealed ambitions cannot be said to be a source of future concern for Britain. Because many of Britain's Far Eastern colonies, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, and autonomous territories, such as New Zealand and Australia, are only separated by a narrow strip of water from Japan's naval bases. Japan's fleet can attack these places as quickly as it can reach them. As one New Zealand political commentator said, "We now know that the so-called Far East is just the near north for us. Science is gradually eliminating the limitations of space, and our security will be unreliable due to the policies and actions of the expansionist faction in the Japanese navy. The distance we should estimate for a naval attack is not the distance between Yokohama and Sydney, but the distance between Palau and New Guinea."

Therefore, at this time when the flames of war are raging in Europe, how to protect her eastern territories is a matter of great concern to those in the British government. Before the outbreak of the European war, as many as 8,000 troops were transferred from India to Singapore. Recently, according to Singapore Governor Thomas's report, British defense forces continue to arrive from India. The purpose of this troop transfer, according to British Imperial Indian Affairs Minister Zetland's explanation in the House of Lords, is that "this measure was adopted after the urgent recommendation of the naval and army authorities, because at that time, the security of India seemed to be threatened from the east. From a military point of view, it is necessary to strengthen the points of access to India from both the east and west." The so-called western threat refers to the southward advance of Germany and the Soviet Union, while the eastern threat certainly does not refer to China.

British military preparations in the Far East were decided at the defense conference held in Singapore in June this year. The purpose of this conference was to form a Pacific Defense Committee to coordinate cooperation between the British forces in New Zealand, Australia, and the South Pacific. The conference was composed of three representatives from New Zealand, Australia, and the British Empire, and a military representative was appointed. Thereafter, the forces commanded by this body included the British fleet stationed in China, the Royal Australian Navy and the New Zealand Navy, the Royal Air Force in the Far East, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the military forces stationed in various colonies in the Far East and the Pacific. Another main purpose of this conference was to create an independent Eastern army. In the event of an emergency, it could fight independently without relying on the replenishment of manpower and material supply from the British Empire itself. For this reason, autonomous territories such as New Zealand and Australia have also been accelerating the expansion of their naval and air forces in recent years in step with their mother country. In the naval field, the Australian government currently has five new-style cruisers and five destroyers. There are also two destroyers under construction, as well as a coastal defense fleet. The number of sailors on the ships is approximately 6,000. As for the air force, there are 212 aircraft and 3,000 pilots. There is also an aircraft factory that can produce 400 combat aircraft annually in peacetime and up to 1,000 aircraft in wartime. New Zealand's development of its air force is also extremely rapid, and it also has an aircraft factory.

Another point that deserves our attention is that France participated in this conference and both sides agreed to close cooperation between the two countries' naval, land, and air forces in the Far East. France and Australia also have a tacit understanding that France's territories along the Pacific coast can be used by Australia for defense for military reasons. As for the Dutch East Indies, which has close relations with British colonies in the Far East, although the Netherlands takes a neutral stance on European events, it cannot remain aloof from its East Indian colonies and must join this group to jointly cope with foreign aggression.

Military matters often contain some secrecy, which cannot be fully understood by outsiders. However, given the British national character of pragmatism, we can be confident that the above-mentioned British military deployments in the East are not merely a show of force. In other words, as a result of close cooperation between the three countries of Britain, France, and the Netherlands, as well as their autonomous territories and colonies, there is at least no need to worry about foreign aggression. From this, it can be inferred that although the widely circulated Anglo-Japanese joint declaration and Anglo-Japanese restoration of the alliance have not been acknowledged by the British side, or are considered unworthy of acknowledgement because they are worthless rumors, with military strength as the backing of diplomacy, if the military is confident and fearless, diplomacy does not have to kneel down and beg for perfection. Various rumors are naturally unnecessary to believe lightly. Moreover, looking at the overall situation, first, British compromise with Japan and British expectations for the United States are fundamentally incompatible, how can Britain get both? To say that Britain would rather alienate the United States and befriend Japan is an inconceivable situation. Second, it is good to have more friends. Any country at war seeks to have fewer enemies. This is an iron rule. But the Far East has been at war for more than two years, and the European war is only fifty days old. At a time when Japan wants to end its war against China but cannot, it dares not go to war with Britain or any other country. In fact, it is far more than Britain in the European war dares not go to war with Japan. In comparison, Britain will not kneel down. This is the obvious conclusion after examining the cooperation between Britain and France and the Netherlands and the completion of military deployments in the East!

Corrigendum: In yesterday's editorial, the phrase "zai bu ke wei ri de qu liang zhe" [在不可為日德曲諒者] in the second paragraph, "zai" [在] is a mistake for "suo" [所]. Also, in the third paragraph, "ying ri xuan lian he" [英日宣　聯合] is a mistake for "ying ri lian he xuan yan" [英日聯合宣言].

### Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty Signed; Does Not Apply to the Soviet Union; Chamberlain Announces Victory in Negotiations

Constantinople, Turkey—This afternoon, England, France, and Turkey signed a mutual assistance treaty here, consisting of nine articles and one statement, exempting Turkey from any obligation to engage in armed conflict with the Soviet Union. The articles are as follows: (1) If Turkey is invaded, England and France must assist. (2) If Turkey, England, and France are all drawn into war in the Mediterranean as a result of an act of aggression, they must assist each other. (3) If Turkey is at war due to England and France fulfilling their guarantees to Greece and Romania, Turkey must assist England and France. (4) If England and France take hostile action as a result of aggression by a European country, and Articles 2 and 3 of this treaty do not apply, the contracting parties may consult and Turkey must at least maintain benevolent neutrality towards England and France. (5) If a European country whose assistance is guaranteed by any of the contracting parties is invaded, or if the security of any contracting party is indirectly threatened by aggression, the contracting parties must consult to adopt a common course of action. (6) This treaty is not concluded to confront any particular country. (7) The articles of this treaty are equally binding, creating mutual obligations between England and Turkey, and between France and Turkey. (8) If the contracting parties engage in war as a result of fulfilling this treaty, they must not negotiate peace separately. (9) The treaty is valid for fifteen years. If it is not terminated upon expiration, it will automatically be extended for five years and shall immediately take effect. (Reuters, 19th)

London—Amid cheers in the House of Commons last night, British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced the conclusion of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty. Opposition Labour Party leader Attlee and Liberal Party leader Hore-Belisha rose to congratulate the government. Chamberlain said: "Members of the House, you will recall that on May 12th of this year, I stated that the British and Turkish governments had agreed, for the sake of national security, to conclude a long-term agreement of a reciprocal nature. The two governments, while this agreement was pending, announced that they were prepared to cooperate effectively in certain circumstances. Subsequently, it was decided that the long-term agreement should take the form of an Anglo-Franco-Turkish tripartite treaty. Although the negotiations that continued after May 12th were protracted, there were never any significant differences of opinion and they were conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust. The articles of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty were finalized three weeks ago. The Turkish government hoped that its foreign minister's visit to Moscow might result in Turkey and the Soviet Union concluding a similar treaty, and the British and French governments agreed to postpone the signing. The negotiations conducted by Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu in Moscow have now been temporarily suspended because certain suggestions made by the Soviet Union are incompatible with the points already agreed upon by England, France, and Turkey. However, both the Soviet Union and Turkey have announced that Turkey's relations with the Soviet Union remain friendly. At the same time, the Turkish government decided not to further delay the signing of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this treaty is valid for at least fifteen years. It is therefore not a temporary measure to deal with an emergency, but an affirmation of the three governments' commitment to a long-term policy of cooperation. The long-running negotiations have now been successfully concluded, and we have established a close and amicable relationship with a nation whose people we greatly admire. I believe the House will be delighted to hear this." Labour Party leader Attlee then spoke, expressing his welcome and hoping that the agreement would last and that Anglo-Turkish friendship would become even stronger. Liberal Party leader Hore-Belisha also rose to speak, saying that the successful conclusion of the difficult negotiations was due to the able guidance of Foreign Secretary Halifax and members of the government, and that this was a great victory. Since the end of the European War, Turkey has made remarkable progress in art, culture, and economic development, which is admirable. Now, Turkey and Britain are fighting together for legal order and international events, which is truly satisfying. All members of parliament cheered. (Reuters, 20th)

### Representatives of Three Countries Congratulate Each Other on Restoring Justice

Istanbul—When the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance agreement was signed in the Turkish capital, no ceremony was held. The British signatory was the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, and the Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Near East, Lieutenant-General Wavell. The French representatives were the French Ambassador to Turkey, René Massigli, and the former Chief of the General Staff, General Weygand. The Turkish representatives were Prime Minister Saydam and Chief of the General Staff General Kâzım Orbay. After the signing, the representatives of the three parties each drank champagne to congratulate each other and solemnly declared that the purpose of this new agreement was to restore justice and lasting peace in Europe. The Turkish side believes that this agreement signifies that the three countries will cooperate to protect all small countries from the expansion of certain powerful countries, especially in the Balkans and the Near East. At the same time, all Turkish newspapers solemnly stated that although the talks between the Soviet Union and Turkey in Moscow have broken down, the twenty-year friendship between the two countries has not been affected. (Reuters, 20th)

### Italy Also Welcomes It

Rome—In the new situation created by the Anglo-Franco-Turkish treaty, two factors are welcomed here. One is Turkey's refusal to change the current status of the Dardanelles Strait to benefit the Soviet Union. Italy is particularly unwilling to see the Soviet navy become a factor in the Mediterranean. The other is Turkey's continued guarantee to Romania. Italy believes this is a sign that Turkey is paying attention to resolving the Balkan issues and organizing a Balkan peace group. Fascist figures believe that the conclusion of this treaty is a natural result of the suspension of the Soviet-Turkish talks. The Turkish Foreign Minister had already indicated his independence in relations with the Soviet Union during the Moscow talks. According to opinions here, the situation before the conclusion of the Soviet-German agreement has now been restored. Although this may not have a direct impact on the war, it seems to have a significant impact on future developments that cannot be predicted. (Reuters, 20th)

### German Officials Frustrated and Disappointed

Berlin—After the signing of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty, German officials were both frustrated and disappointed, as can be seen in the comments in various morning newspapers. The Essen National Daily (the mouthpiece of Aviation Minister General Göring) published an article a few days ago strongly stating, "It is time for Turkey to decide its attitude." Now, it has to admit in a pessimistic tone that Turkey has already made its choice, but the direction it has taken is not what Germany had expected, and even claims that Turkey has become a mercenary of Britain. On the other hand, the general public here is extremely concerned about the failure of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. They believe that the Soviet Union has always upheld the German viewpoint and taken its interests into consideration. It is also said that the aim of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty is clearly to resist Germany's expansion in Southeast Europe. It is noteworthy that the Soviet Union was not shocked after the publication of the treaty. The fact that Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has repeatedly held talks with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax recently is also highly suspicious to the general public here. In short, general public opinion believes that Germany has once again been deceived by the Soviet Union. However, German officials say, "Turkey has made the same mistake as Poland," to threaten Turkey. (Agence Havas, 20th)

Berlin—Regarding the signing of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty, the official authorities here have not yet issued any comments. Political figures said that it is aimed at the Soviet Union and Italy, and that Germany will issue comments only after the Soviet Union and Italy have expressed their reactions. (Haitong, 20th)

### American Newspapers Call It an Anglo-French Victory

New York—The New York Times reported that the Allied countries have gained substantial benefits from the Anglo-Franco-Turkish mutual assistance agreement. This agreement is the first real victory for the Allied side since the outbreak of the war. The Allied countries, having experienced repeated disappointments and setbacks, are especially welcoming this agreement. (Reuters, 20th)

### British and French Near East Military Commanders Meet with Turkish Military Authorities; Turkish Foreign Minister Sends Telegram to the Soviet Union to Maintain Bilateral Relations

Constantinople, Turkey—The Commander-in-Chief of French Forces in the Near East, the former Chief of the Army General Staff General Weygand, and the Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Near East General Wavell, jointly visited the Turkish Minister of Defense General Tımaz and Chief of the General Staff General Çakmak this morning to conduct military talks. The content has not been released. The talks will continue tomorrow. Prime Minister Saydam will host a banquet tomorrow evening to entertain the representatives of England and France.

He hereby requests His Excellency to accept his assurance of friendly feelings. (TASS, 20th)

### Southeast Scotland: Three Air Raid Alerts; Enemy Planes Reconnoitered Without Dropping Bombs; Western Front Still Quiet

London—Scotland was raided by German planes this morning. Air raid alerts were issued in eastern and southern Scotland, and the sound of anti-aircraft guns was heard. The alert was lifted half an hour later, but the British anti-aircraft gunfire did not stop. Half an hour after the first alert was lifted, a second alert was issued, which was lifted after ten minutes. (Reuters, 20th)

London—It is reported that several German planes flew towards the Firth of Forth in Scotland this morning. The cities of southeastern Scotland immediately issued three air raid alerts.

In addition, enemy planes were heard flying over the Firth of Forth. (Agence Havas, 20th)

Paris—The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 92, stating, "Last night it rained. Apart from the activity of both sides' scouts, the front was quiet." (Agence Havas, 20th)

Paris—The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 92 in the evening, which, in addition to reporting the situation, also recalled the German attacks on the 16th of this month, stating, "Yesterday, both sides' reconnaissance units patrolled repeatedly east of the Moselle River. Our artillery was very active there. As for the fighting on the 16th of this month, the German army launched attacks in two directions on that day. One was on a six-kilometer front east of the Moselle River, and the other was on a thirty-kilometer front east of the Saar River. However, our divisions, which had reached that area in September, had already been ordered to withdraw the main force to the rear when the enemy began bombardment in preparation for the attack. Only a small number of infantry and cavalry units were left on each front. Therefore, both enemy attacks failed. The small number of cavalry units at that time also retreated to the pre-arranged defense lines according to the plan. The losses were minimal, with only one enemy officer and about fifty soldiers captured by us. However, they resisted bravely and did not yield until death. In short, our army has already deployed a new front line according to the plan, and we have captured many enemy soldiers in most places." (Agence Havas, 19th)

Paris—British Aviation Minister Sir Kingsley Wood arrived here yesterday to hold talks with Aviation Minister Laurent-Eynac. Full understanding has been reached on various issues concerning the mutual cooperation between the British and French air forces. (Agence Havas, 18th)

Berlin—The German High Command declared that after the end of the fighting in the Saarbrücken southeast war zone, the Western Front has become quiet, with only minor artillery battles and reconnaissance activities. (Haitong, 20th)

Paris—Fifty French soldiers were surrounded by a German reconnaissance unit in the front lines yesterday. After fierce resistance, it is reported that they were captured by the enemy. Semi-official sources here recently stated that this did not happen when our outpost troops were withdrawing, but when the two sides' positions were re-established and the outpost troops made contact again. Apart from this, the entire line was very quiet. As for the number of French soldiers captured by the German army, the number they claim is actually far greater than the total losses of the French army, which has been denied by our military authorities. Even in terms of the number of French planes shot down they have claimed, it is also greatly exaggerated. They have reduced the number of enemy planes shot down by us, claiming that they have only lost eleven planes on the Western Front. However, according to the announcement of our General Headquarters, there were as many as twenty-four enemy planes shot down within our military positions in the first half of September alone, not counting those shot down within enemy positions.

### British Preparedness Far Superior to the Past; Naval Power Can Control the North Sea; Confidence in Victory

London—According to experienced observers here, Britain's preparedness today is far superior to that of 1914. Britain has been accumulating military supplies, reorganizing its army, and implementing conscription for a year, and unlike the last war, it does not have to divide its forces to Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Dardanelles. Now, it can use its full naval power to prevent supplies to Germany, and can deploy millions of troops on the Western Front, which are placed under unified command from the beginning. Germany, on the other hand, has insufficient food and supplies for its people at the beginning of the war, and its morale is low. Its supplies are only sufficient for short-term needs, and its hopes of relying on Soviet supplies are dim. Although several countries continue to trade with Germany, Germany has limited gold reserves and cannot afford to pay for the goods purchased from these countries. In view of Britain's determination, all neutral countries now recognize Britain's right to suppress German supplies. Germany's only hope is to win the war quickly, but it is blocked by the heavily fortified Maginot Line and has little chance of success. Although Britain has suffered some losses, it still controls the North Sea, because Britain has many ships and it is easy to make up for the losses. Germany claims to control the North Sea and calls it the "German coast," but there is not a single German merchant ship in the North Sea today. German ships cannot enter the North Sea, nor can they break through the network of British warships and aircraft. British ships, on the other hand, are constantly traveling back and forth in the North Sea. The German fleet has not attempted to break through this steel network, and the German air force's attacks on British ships have only resulted in costly failures. (Reuters, 20th)

### Turkey's New Railway Holds Inauguration Ceremony; Strategically Important

Istanbul—Turkey's new railway from Sivas to Erzurum held an inauguration ceremony today. Many Turkish government ministers attended the grand ceremony. The railway extends to the Soviet-Turkish border in the Caucasus region and is not only economically important but also strategically important. During the last World War, Turkey's war against Russia was severely affected due to the lack of this railway. The railway is connected to the narrow-gauge railway that was built before the war to the Turkish border fortress of Kars. (Haitong, 20th)

### Joint Declaration Issued After Nordic Four Nations Conference; Demands That All Countries Respect Their Neutrality; Unwilling To Take The Initiative In Mediating The European Situation

Stockholm—After the conclusion of the conference of the heads of state of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, a joint official report was issued, the main points of which were to declare the absolute neutrality of the Nordic four countries in the current European war, and to indicate that the Scandinavian countries are prepared to participate in the mediation efforts to restore peace in Europe at any time. The original text is as follows: "1. From October 18 to 19, 1939, the Kings of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, the President of Finland, and the Foreign Ministers of the four countries held a meeting in the capital of Sweden to discuss general attitudes and individual issues of each country. First, it was declared the complete and free determination to maintain a neutral position, and requested that other countries respect it. Secondly, the four countries decided to follow the policy of the joint declaration issued by Norway, Sweden, and Denmark between 1914 and 1918. Regarding the current war, regardless of its time and scale, the Nordic four countries must maintain friendly and trusting relations. Thirdly, various difficulties in commerce and shipping caused by various measures of the belligerent countries were discussed, and it was decided to cooperate with each other for joint protection, to promote the relationship of the Oslo Group, and to take steps to protect joint interests with other neutral countries. Fourth, during the meeting, the King of Sweden received many telegrams from neutral countries in the Americas, the contents of which have been published. The Nordic countries attach great importance to them. Finally, before the outbreak of war in Europe, the Nordic countries sent a telegram to King Leopold of Belgium, expressing their willingness to promote peace. The heart is sincere and unwavering, and the Nordic countries will be very welcoming and supportive if it is possible to reach an understanding between the belligerent countries and establish a peaceful order." (Haitong, 20th)

Stockholm—After the conclusion of the four-nation conference, Finnish President Kallio announced on the radio in the presidential palace here today that the peace-loving Finnish people, while only hoping for peaceful lives in their own country, will unanimously defend their independence. They have always hoped that their strong neighbors will respect the peace treaty signed with Finland, which clearly stipulates that disputes, if any, will be resolved peacefully. Finland abides by its obligations and trusts in God, and believes in the justice of its cause. The Kings of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark who attended the meeting also gave speeches (see yesterday's telegram). (Reuters, 19th)

Stockholm—The "Daily News" recently commented on the results of the Nordic four-nation conference, saying, "The right to national self-determination of the Nordic countries has been reiterated by this conference. It is a good thing that these countries, as expected, did not assume the role of mediator for the current European war, as any attempt to mediate under the current circumstances would be a futile gesture." The "Social Democratic Newspaper" stated, "Unless the belligerent countries accept mediation, neutral countries should not rashly speak of mediation." The "Times" stated, "The front line of the Nordic countries has been strengthened by this conference." In addition, all newspapers have praised the main achievement of this conference, which is that Finland, with the support of other Nordic countries, will maintain neutrality and safeguard its independence with a firm attitude.

### General Xue Yue Talks: Northern Hunan Defense is Strong; People and Army Cooperate Closely; Japan Intends to Resume Offensives to Capture;

Hunan: According to General Xue Yue, Commander of the Chinese Army in the Ninth War Zone, in a conversation with the Associated Press reporter, the Japanese army may be ready to complete preparations and attack Changsha again after three months. However, after my (the reporter's self-reference) inspection of the 30-mile war zone from Changsha, I firmly believe that if the Japanese army attempts to attack Changsha again, they will inevitably take another route. The area north of Hunan that I passed through is entirely a tea-producing region, rich in romance. Every spring, the young women here mostly use the money earned from picking tea as dowry and seek their ideal husbands during the tea-picking season. At the same time, this area was formerly a trade route. As for now, although it has not been invaded by the Japanese, it has become a no-man's land. Except for a few farmers still engaged in farming, most have moved elsewhere. Although some have returned to the area, they mostly come to retrieve belongings. As for the roads in this area, most have been completely destroyed. Along the way, there are traps thirty feet wide and fifteen feet deep dug to prevent the movement of tanks, artillery vehicles, and heavy artillery. At the same time, old-fashioned handcarts are also inconvenient to travel. Some sections of the road have been completely turned into rice paddies, and ponds are everywhere. Tanks and heavy artillery in them would feel unable to move an inch. As for the slopes of the small hills, machine gun positions are everywhere. In this environment, the Japanese naturally have no way to advance. According to General Xue Yue, the Chinese army employs three tactics in the northern area: (1) Destroy all transportation to render the Japanese mechanized units completely useless, while cutting off the Japanese rear transportation; (2) Relocate all the people in the path of the Japanese army to prevent the Japanese from obtaining guides and from obtaining food; (3) Lure the Japanese army into the mountains and annihilate them. The northern Hunan area has such defensive methods and the people have a very practical cooperation with the army. Therefore, the Chinese side can easily repel the Japanese army's attack. The Chinese military officers here also deeply believe that the Japanese army is likely to launch another offensive. According to General Xue Yue, in this kind of terrain, 90,000 Chinese soldiers armed with rifles, machine guns, and mortars can contain the advance of 180,000 Japanese soldiers. But even if the Japanese army manages to capture Changsha, all they will get is an empty city. Changsha used to have 200,000 people, but now it only has 40,000, and they all have special permits. When ordered to evacuate, they can evacuate immediately. The goods in the shops in the city have also been completely moved. There are also very few boats in the Xiang River; those that exist are hired by refugees because Japanese armed speedboats often attack passing ships. As for the Japanese air raids, they have disappeared in the last three days, which shows the great effect of the recent Chinese aircraft bombing of the Japanese airfield in Hankou. Before the Chinese aircraft bombed the Japanese airfield in Hankou, the areas of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi were subjected to at least one Japanese air raid every day. The railways and roads from Changsha to Hengyang have been dismantled by the Chinese side, and countless traps for tanks and heavy artillery have been dug. When the reporter arrived in Changsha, he took a shallow-bottomed steamboat that was less than three feet deep, but the bottom of the boat was often rubbed, because there were a large number of mines and barriers laid underwater. At the same time, the Chinese side has extremely strict defenses on both sides of the Xiang River, so if the Japanese want to advance, they must be assisted by infantry. According to General Xue, if the Japanese come again, the Chinese side can still give them a crushing defeat. The three months of war this year have enabled the Chinese side to gain new tactics, and the combat effectiveness of the Chinese army has also greatly increased. We are now using the lessons we have learned in the past: the best defensive battle is an offensive battle. "For example, recently, the Chinese army had a battle line stretching 250 miles from Nanchang to Dongting Lake, and the Chinese army's position was extremely unfavorable, but we were able to attack the weak points of the Japanese army, so we were able to turn danger into safety. It is heard that the Japanese are now gathering reinforcements and sending another five divisions. We welcome them very much and firmly believe that the Japanese will definitely not be able to cope with us in this kind of geographical environment in northern Hunan, because the Chinese in this area are all soldiers with extremely experienced mountain warfare. At the same time, we will take the offensive in the future and will never only take the defensive. We must cut off the Japanese transportation lines, so we firmly believe that if the Japanese try to attack again, we will win another complete victory." (Report from Martin, special correspondent of the Associated Press, 20th)

### Children's Nursery Opens; Conference of Directors

Chongqing: The Wartime Children's Nursery Association of the Chinese Women's Association for Comforting and Defending Soldiers in the War of Resistance held its first conference of directors of children's nurseries on the morning of the 20th in 淪. A director of a certain branch gave a speech and reported on the progress, saying that today's Wartime Children's Nursery Association is convening the first conference of directors of children's nurseries. In addition to those present, there are still a few directors who have telegraphed for leave due to difficulties in traveling back and forth. Since its establishment, the Children's Nursery Association has had 16 nurseries, housing about 20,000 children, and a total of more than 1,000 service personnel directly participating in the work. There are even more people indirectly participating in the nursery work. The Ministry of Finance allocates a certain amount of subsidies every month, and the insufficient amount is generously raised by Madam Chiang Kai-shek, who appeals to enthusiastic people at home and abroad for donations, which is admirable. Since the War of Resistance, the number of displaced children has been very large, and the nurseries have only taken in about one-tenth of them. It is hoped that all sectors will enthusiastically support the nursery work, which is of great importance to the future of the country and the nation. How to expand the nursery work in the future is a serious issue. How has the past nursery work been achieved? Is it reasonable for us? Where should we improve? What are the shortcomings? What are the advantages? These should all be important issues in this conference. This can also be reported. Moreover, the nursery movement relies on the leadership and promotion of Madam Chiang Kai-shek to have today's scale, so it is inevitable to express our deep respect to Madam Chiang Kai-shek, etc. It was decided to invite Madam Chiang Kai-shek to give instructions and Yan Fuqing, the director of the Department of Health, gave a speech. Finally, the director's representative gave a reply and the meeting adjourned. (Telegraph from the 20th)

### Plenary Session of the Central Committee to be Convened Soon

Chongqing: According to the Kuomintang today, speaking to the Associated Press reporter, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang may be convened soon according to a temporary decision. It is heard that what this plenary session wants to discuss is the determination of foreign policy to adapt to the current domestic and international situation, as a guiding principle for the third year of the War of Resistance. The Fifth Plenary Session was held in January of this year, when it passed resolutions such as continuing the War of Resistance, denouncing Wang Jingwei, and concentrating the will of the Kuomintang to support the War of Resistance. The Fourth Plenary Session was convened in Hankou in April of last year, when it passed the close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as the basis for the long-term War of Resistance.

### Two Italian Sailors Arrested by Japanese

Beiping: On Thursday evening, two Italian sailors were arrested by Japanese military police for fighting with a Japanese person, and have not been released so far. The location of the arrest was in the Luxi Grand Theater (transliteration). According to the Italian side, a Japanese person was rude to a Chinese woman at the time, so he stepped forward to help and punched the Japanese person to the ground. As a result, Japanese soldiers entered the theater, fought with the Italian soldiers, and arrested the two Italian soldiers. (Telegraph from the Associated Press, 20th)

### Yunnan Tea Company Preparing to Expand

### Swede, Su Dupeng, Regains Freedom

Beiping: News was received here from Zhangjiakou that the Swede, Su Dupeng, who has lived in Inner Mongolia for a long time, has been released after being detained in the Japanese military headquarters in Zhangjiakou for three months. One of the conditions for Su's release is that he must not leave the Mengjiang area. The matter seems to have been resolved amicably, because it is heard that the Japanese side has asked Su to lead a Japanese exploration team into Inner Mongolia to search for the Nestorian relics he is most familiar with. It is heard that the Japanese military police suspected Su of working for the interests of a certain third country, so they arrested him in Zhangjiakou on June 24. Now it is heard from reliable sources that the relevant third country is probably the United Kingdom, because some of the guests whom Su entertained at his residence, where he has lived for many years, were British personnel from the British Embassy, which aroused the suspicion of the Japanese side. Lieutenant Cooper, a British translator who was arrested for going to Zhangjiakou to investigate the detention of British military officer Colonel Spear, was also among the guests. According to reports, Guihua does not have a hotel, so for many years, foreign merchants traveling to Guihua have stayed at Su's residence in groups. (Telegraph from Reuters, 19th)

### Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Ordered to Form Cabinet

Baoging: After King Boris accepted the resignation of the Zagev Cabinet, he is still continuing to discuss the formation of a new government with various politicians. It is heard that the reason for the resignation of the cabinet is that, in the current situation where major issues affecting the Balkans are emerging one after another, there should be a government that fully reflects the national will to maintain its position. The figures in the previous cabinet were almost all of the non-partisan faction, so it is expected that the new cabinet will include some politicians. Former Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov has been ordered to form a new cabinet. (Telegraph from Reuters, 20th)

Baoging: There is no surprise here regarding the resignation of the Bulgarian cabinet, because Prime Minister Kyoseivanov had already announced that he intended to completely reorganize the cabinet before the opening of the National Assembly on October 28 this year. King Boris will take advantage of this opportunity to hold consultations with national political leaders, and received Moushanov, the Speaker of the House of Representatives yesterday afternoon. Those who will be received today include former Prime Minister Stamboliyski, former Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nikola Moushanov, and members of the Association party, such as Pastukhov. It is expected that the new Bulgarian cabinet will be formed no later than tomorrow. The candidate for prime minister is still Kyoseivanov. In terms of lineup, in view of the seriousness of the international situation, a broad foundation will be adopted to recruit leaders from all factions. (Telegraph from Haitong, 20th)

### Chao-Shan Chinese Army's Commando Attack on Chaozhou City; Annihilated Over a Hundred Japanese and Puppet Troops; Chinese Air Force Destroys Japanese Warehouse

Shantou Correspondent: The Chao-Shan Chinese Army is actively planning to counterattack the Japanese army. Wu Qiwu, Zou Hong, Hua Zhenzhong, etc., convened a conference of county heads and guerrilla leaders in Lantou Baita, Jieyang on the first of this month to redistribute the commando attack force. At 1:00 a.m. on the 3rd, they completed assembly at Fengling on the Anjie Road and divided into two routes to attack Chao'an City. Goto, the commander of the Japanese army in Chao'an, had his morale reduced after being reinforced. In the latter half of September, he made two breakthroughs, both of which were frustrated. He still held the suburbs and strengthened defensive works. On the Chinese side, Zou Hong commanded the security team to attack the northeast gate from Yixi, while the Xiao regiment of Hua Zhenzhong's brigade attacked the southwest gate from Fengxi. Around 2:00 a.m., the fighting had already begun. A part of the security team crossed the river to the foot of Bijia Mountain and surrounded the Han Shan Normal School. They had bypassed the Shangshuimen dike and attacked the Japanese army's position at the east gate. The Japanese army in the city, hearing the sound of guns and cannons coming from the east gate, Han Shan was on fire, and the smoke filled the Xiangzi Bridge, and they rushed back to rescue the east gate. At this time, the Xiao regiment of the Hua Brigade had climbed over the west gate city wall and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army in Dayin Street and Xinqiao City. The guerrillas who had ambushed in the city suddenly responded and blocked the Japanese army from passing through Taiping Road. As a result, a fierce battle broke out in the city. Until 6:00 a.m., more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops were annihilated, and the Chinese army began to disperse and withdraw from the suburbs of the south gate. Around 9:00 a.m., five new Chinese air force planes flew to Chaozhou City from northern Guangdong. At that time, the Japanese army outside the city was preparing to pursue the Chinese army, but stopped when they saw the arrival of the Chinese air force. The Chinese air force reconnaissance lasted for twenty minutes and flew along the coast of Shantou towards Guangzhou. The Japanese army in Chaozhou City then decided to blow the horns again to gather the team. Another team of the new Chinese air force continued to Chaozhou City and dropped more than 20 bombs on the Xiangzi Bridge in the southeast suburbs. The Japanese army's anti-aircraft guns bombarded wildly. The Chinese air force safely flew north. On that day, the Japanese military warehouses at the Spring City Tower Main Station, East Embankment, Hulu Mountain, and Zhugao Mountain in the South Gate were all hit by bombs. The Spring City Tower, the end point of the dike road, was hit by eight bombs. More than 60 Japanese soldiers were killed or injured, and military treasures were destroyed. It is heard that the five Chinese aircraft that flew to Chaozhou first transferred to Guangzhou City's Bai'etan and Henan Inner Harbor Wharf to drop bombs, destroying eight Japanese warehouses in the Inner Harbor. The Japanese military's ammunition and electric oil stored there were hit and burned fiercely. A Japanese ship in Bai'etan was also hit and sank into the water. More than a dozen transport steamships and cargo boats were bombed and sunk.

### New Grain Enters the Market in Wuxi; Rice Prices Unexpectedly Rise Again

Wuxi Correspondent: Xiyi has always been the concentration point of the Suzhou-Changzhou rice market. There are many firms in the Beidang area, but they all rely on large-scale shipments from Anhui, Jiangxi, and Yili counties to Wuxi to prepare for rice merchants from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Qingjin, and other ports to come to Wuxi to explore and handle them, and circulate them through transshipment. The firms in this area get profits in the middle. However, capitalists often take advantage of the low prices of goods, compete to buy them, store them in warehouses, hoard them, and monopolize them for profit, or take advantage of the high prices and shortages of goods in Shanghai to smuggle them in large quantities and sell them at good prices. This year's rice prices started at 12 yuan in the spring and once rose as high as 25 yuan during the summer and autumn, causing the lower classes to complain endlessly. After the rice merchants dredged the source, although the new rice has been on the market recently, it still hovers around 18 yuan. Combined with the measuring instruments of the past, the price of each stone of rice is still above 20 yuan. Examining the reasons for this, recently, rice boats from Anhui, Wuhu, Nanjing, and other places have successively arrived in port. In the four villages of Muxian County, early rice has entered the market and the harvest is still good. There are also people who come to the city to sell rice and exchange it for goods. Boats from Changzhou, Yixing, Jintan, and Liyang counties are gradually coming one after another. Market prices should have fallen back, but recently someone at the rice market tea party has waved to move thousands of bags of Shanghai rice grains. The general firms have calculated that after deducting the shipping cost of six or seven yuan per bag, there is still a profit to be made. Therefore, they all compete to rush to the market to handle the matter in order to install it quickly. For a time, supply could not meet demand. In a few days, each stone rose by two yuan. Indica rice could not avoid being affected. According to this situation, we must wait for the late rice to enter the market in large quantities and for the influx of tourists from all over the world to be strong before there is hope of a decline.

### Japanese Army from Suzhou Opens to Jiaxing; Ambushed Near Shengze; More Than Three Hundred People Were Annihilated; Xu Minzhong has been Killed in Hangzhou

Hangzhou Correspondent: Recently, the Chinese army in the Jiaxing area has been unusually active. The original strength of the Japanese army was very weak, so the Japanese army was transferred from Suzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places to increase defense. A few days ago, early in the morning, more than 300 Japanese soldiers took three trains along the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway to Jiaxing. The Chinese army heard about this and immediately sent a team to ambush the road corner and buried landmines. When the Japanese army arrived near Shengze, they were ambushed by a landmine. More than 50 Japanese soldiers were turned into powder. The remaining Japanese soldiers were also attacked by the Chinese ambush soldiers. It is heard that they were all annihilated.

After the Chinese army in the suburbs of Hangzhou joined forces with the fresh forces of the Chinese army that arrived from the south bank, its strength has become even more formidable. A week ago, the ×××th Division of the Chinese army destroyed four Japanese military vehicles near Linping Xucun, and more than half of the Japanese soldiers died. Last night, the ×××th Division of the Chinese army attacked the hydropower plant, an important military organ of the Yaokou Army, and a fierce battle broke out. The battle continued until dawn, and the two sides were still fighting, but the hydropower plant there had been burned by the Chinese army. It is also learned that the Chinese army outside the Genshan Gate attacked the Japanese army there late at night a few days ago. The two sides fought fiercely for a day and a night. The Japanese army suffered more than a hundred casualties.

Xu Minzhong, the magistrate of Pinghu County, convened a meeting of Baojia in the Xincang area two weeks ago. Unfortunately, he was captured by the Japanese army and taken to the Pinghu Military Police Team for interrogation, resulting in a damaged body. Later, he was transferred from Pinghu to the Japanese Special Service Agency in Hangzhou. He was repeatedly induced to surrender with benefits, but he refused. It is heard that he was killed outside the Qingbo Gate in Hangzhou on the 19th. It is also learned that Xu could not even walk (because he was injured by torture) when he was escorted to the execution ground, but he was still whipped frequently along the way. Xu did not change his expression at all and shouted slogans loudly, which moved everyone who heard it.

### Golden Gate and Xiamen Daily Nightmares: Japanese Officer Assassinated; Notorious Puppets Flee to Hong Kong and Shanghai

Fuzhou Dispatch: The Xiamen Liaison Department of the Japanese Asia Development Board recently ordered the puppet regime in Xiamen to establish a so-called Fujian Province Peace Promotion Association to promote "peace." The puppet municipal government has already complied and organized its establishment, even holding a propaganda meeting at the Lujiang Theater, which the public was forced to attend, but the number was very small. Furthermore, many officials of the puppet municipal government have recently become aware that the collapse of the Japanese army is imminent, so they are all preparing to escape. Lu Yongchuan, the secretary of the puppet municipal government, Xiao Bingrong, the director of the puppet police bureau, and Jin Fusheng, the director of the puppet finance bureau, have already left Xiamen one after another. Lu claimed to be going to Shantou to contact the puppet organizations there to exchange information, but in reality, he plans to escape to Hong Kong or go abroad. Jin claimed that he wanted to go to Shanghai to bring his family to Xiamen to escape the tiger's mouth. Therefore, the Japanese army has been intensifying its surveillance of the puppets in recent days. Unexpectedly, Tamura Hanjun, an officer of the Japanese Army Ministry, was suddenly assassinated by someone in front of the Taiwan Guild Hall on Minquan Road, Xiamen, at 8:00 AM on September 12, and died on the spot. The order was in chaos at the time. The Japanese army immediately dispatched troops to search, and four speedboats patrolled the docks and prohibited ships from coming and going, cutting off traffic between Xiamen and Gulangyu. It was not until 4:00 PM that traffic was restored. At that time, the Japanese army arrested dozens of innocent Chinese civilians. Tamura's body was cremated by the Japanese Army Special Service Agency stationed in Xiamen on the 16th and transported back to Japan. After the incident, the Japanese army in Xiamen was extremely frightened and imposed martial law day and night, and offered rewards for information. However, one wave subsided, and another rose. The Japanese army installed a cannon on the Dashi Lake Fortress on Heshan Mountain in Xiamen, and fired indiscriminately at Jimei and other places. Dozens of soldiers were stationed there, and they raised the flag every morning. On the evening of September 23, the flag was taken down and many anti-Japanese slogans were found nearby. When the Japanese soldiers saw this situation, they immediately split up and searched everywhere, but found nothing. They then reported the situation to the Naval Command, which ordered all posts to deploy police and keep a close watch. The next day, two Japanese soldiers were found tied up and unable to move at a certain post. The command of the fort interrogated the two Japanese soldiers, but could not get any useful information. The Naval Department was very ashamed and angry, and severely reprimanded them. The Japanese military command therefore became suspicious, saying that the Chinese army along the coast of Xiamen was about to counterattack Xiamen, and there was a general atmosphere of panic in the city. At 10:00 PM, special martial law was imposed, and all key points along the coast were guarded by the Japanese army, without using puppet police. As for the guerrillas on Kinmen Island, they are extremely active, making it difficult for the Japanese and puppets to eat and sleep, and there are often incidents of attacks, assassinations, and poisoning. The Xiamen Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board recently summoned Wang Tingzhi, the head of the Kinmen puppet maintenance association, to Xiamen and severely reprimanded him, saying that he was weak in ability, inefficient in handling affairs, and did not win the trust of the islanders, which led to the guerrillas lurking on the island. In his words, he was stern and ordered the abolition of the puppet Kinmen Security Maintenance Association and the establishment of a puppet administrative supervisory office, which was under the command of the puppet Xiamen municipal government. The entire island was divided into two districts, the first district was located in Shawei Street, and the second district was located in Houpu, each with a puppet district chief. The original small puppets of the puppet association were mostly laid off. At the same time, the Japanese and Taiwanese people living in Kinmen and Xiamen were evacuated in batches, divided into three steps: (1) The bourgeoisie and strong men, women, and children were transported to Taiwan and Japan from Fujian and Hong Kong respectively. (2) The middle class and merchants are under investigation. (3) The common people and hooligans will be the last batch to leave. A large number of Xiamen and Heshan civilian workers were hired to dig trenches, pile sandbags, and install barbed wire and other obstacles at various key points in Heshan and at the intersections of Dahan Road, Jinbang Road, Chenguang Road, Sailboat Reef, Xiamen Port, and Sh坡尾. Searchlights were installed around the positions, as if facing a major enemy. At the end of September, a street battle was held, and the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. For a time, shouts of killing were heard everywhere. The Japanese army resisted stubbornly all the way from Siming South Road and Haihou Road. In the end, the Chinese army became more and more numerous, and fought more and more bravely, fiercely pressing towards the Japanese army's positions. The Japanese army was unable to support and released smoke bombs to cover their retreat. Their embarrassing state was laughable. After the retreat order was issued, the Japanese army divided into two groups and fled in search of a way out. One group retreated from Siming South Road to Dashengli and retreated to the Xiamen University at the foot of Fengyao Mountain and boarded ships at the Shanhai Ice Factory pier. The other group retreated along Zhongshan Road through the Water God Temple to Huyu. They were hiding and panicking along the way. It can be seen that the Japanese army in Xiamen is weak and unwilling to fight. However, after this exercise, the Japanese soldiers and puppet police were deeply impressed and were frightened several times a night and could not live in peace. The people of Xiamen Island were secretly happy. Unexpectedly, as soon as the exercise was over, many Blood Soul Group notices and slogans were found everywhere on Gulangyu the next morning. Although the Japanese army searched in every possible way for these notices, it was difficult to find any traces.

### Japanese Merchants in Changzhou Attacked

Changzhou Dispatch: In the morning before yesterday, near Mishiwan outside the West Gate, two Japanese merchants were selling goods when suddenly a number of Chinese mobile teams came and, suspecting that the Japanese merchants were soldiers, fired several shots, all of which hit vital points. They fell inside the Dingfeng Rice Shop, one person falling at the entrance. The puppet police of Changji Huaide Bridge reported to the West Gate puppet police station. At the same time, the Japanese military police also rushed to the scene. The two injured Japanese merchants were sent to the Japanese military hospital in the city. The area where the incident occurred was searched house by house by the Japanese army, and many nearby merchants and civilians were taken to the Japanese military police headquarters.

### Finance: Hong Kong Banks Sell Foreign Exchange All Day; It Is Not Easy for Hong Kong Commerce to Operate; Funds Continue to Transfer to Shanghai

The HSBC listing of foreign exchange has not fluctuated. The black market of British and American exchange rates has shown a steady but slightly firmer trend, but the situation is still stagnant. Prices have no speculative nature. The process yesterday was initially caused by the fact that overseas British and American exchange rates increased by one point, resulting in the morning opening showing signs of tight British and flat American exchange rates. Subsequently, Hong Kong banks aggressively plugged in, and exporters also sold off one after another. HSBC absorbed as many as possible, but the American exchange rate had risen to 7.75 yuan, but because it was also profitable to buy in, the loose trend was reversed. However, Hong Kong banks continuously threw out all day, reportedly as much as 200,000 pounds (equivalent to over 10 million National Currency), resulting in a flat British exchange rate and a slightly looser American exchange rate. It is reported that Chinese merchants and Hong Kong banks have sold off a large number of chips in recent days due to the extreme stability of the legal currency, the tightening of the European situation, and the various commercial shackles of the war in Hong Kong, making it difficult for funds to operate. Therefore, there is a natural trend for funds to transfer to Shanghai. The potential of futures was originally the same as the spot market, but there was little trading. Apart from Hong Kong banks, there were few transactions throughout the day.

Profits Still Being Absorbed

At the beginning of the morning, London's big deals reduced the near term by 1.25 and the far term by 3.75. New York silver prices fell by 0.25. London raw gold remained stagnant. The exchange rate of British against Shanghai, France, and other currencies was flat. American against British increased by one point, against Shanghai was unchanged, and against France increased by 1.125. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British gold 4 pence 9375 and American exchange 7.6875 yuan. Compared with the previous close, the British slightly tightened by 0.015625 and the American was unchanged, which was due to the increase in the exchange rate. After the opening, Hong Kong sent telegrams to sell off, and exporters also sold off, so the trend was slightly looser. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegrams and exporters sold 625 gold to HSBC spot. At the same time, the spot price of American exchange also rose to 7.75 yuan, but there were few transactions. HSBC's listed prices did not move, and the silver balance tax was reduced by 0.01. After that, there were fewer buyers and sellers discussing transactions, so the market was quite calm for a while. Until after 10:30, profits suddenly came to absorb, the same industry spot British gold 4 pence 625, and the spot American exchange 7.71875 yuan. The situation seemed to be slightly more stable. Extending to the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold 4 pence 609375 and American exchange 7.71875 yuan, compared to the morning opening, the British returned looser by 0.015625 and the American slightly lower by 0.03125.

The state of the market is becoming quieter, and the price is hardly worthy of honor or disgrace. However, Hong Kong telegrams continued to plug in 625 British gold to HSBC spot, and there was no trading in American exchange. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was British gold 4 pence 609375 and American exchange 7.71875 yuan (most of them may be difficult to buy at the above price). This month's price is the same as the above price. November British gold 4 pence 546875 and American exchange 7.59375 yuan. The result is that the current British average is flat compared to the previous day, and the American is looser by 0.03125.

Hong Kong British Exchange Rate Unchanged

Hong Kong, 20th telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The current British exchange rate is unchanged. The spot American exchange rate is looser by 0.0625, at 25.0625 yuan. The forward rate was not issued. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by one yuan, to 322 yuan. The spot Japanese exchange rate was slightly looser by 0.25, to 106.75 yuan. The market was stable throughout the day, and the market was also without honor.

Tianjin Exchange Rate Continues to Loosen

Tianjin, 20th telegram: The exchange market opened this morning and continued to loosen. The spot British exchange rate was looser by 0.0625, at 4 pence 125. The spot American exchange rate was looser by 125, at 6.9375 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate continued to fall by 2.75 yuan, to 110.05 yuan. The "Joint Note" black market was unchanged, still at 86 yuan.

### Cash Market Calm

Yesterday, the spot gold market's sluggish and listless situation showed no sign of change. The small price fluctuations and the lack of interest among operators were already discussed repeatedly in previous reports, so I will not elaborate further. Throughout the day, the market remained weak. Initially, gold firms aggressively pushed down prices, with rumors of a transaction at 1,000 yuan, a drop of nine yuan from the previous day. However, limited-price buyers hesitated to accumulate, and the Hong Kong syndicate's counter-pull managed to raise the price by eight yuan. Subsequently, due to the strength of foreign exchange rates, gold firms sold again. Eventually, relying on currency exchange businesses stepping in on behalf of clients to buy at opportune moments, the downward momentum was prevented from expanding. After a period of fluctuating, the market closed at 1,005 yuan, a drop of one yuan from the previous day. Trading was quiet, with a total volume of over 600 taels. Gold jewelry prices remained fixed, and customs gold prices remained stable.

Spot Gold Only Drops Four Yuan

The opening price for spot gold (ten taels) was slightly firm due to the strength of foreign markets, but the overall situation was weak. A certain gold firm initially offered a price of 4,000 yuan to securities firms for ten taels, a decrease of nine yuan from the previous close. Shortly after, the Hong Kong syndicate initiated purchases, and buying interest suddenly increased, causing the situation to stabilize. A certain jewelry store aggressively bought about 200 taels on behalf of the Hong Kong syndicate, pushing the price up by eight yuan. These purchases were supplied by currency exchange businesses, gold firms, and other related businesses. Subsequently, as the Hong Kong syndicate stopped buying and observed, the market weakened again, dropping another six yuan. Currency exchange businesses sold 30 taels to securities firms for 4,002 yuan. Later, a certain currency exchange business suddenly pulled up the price, rebounding by five yuan. Currency exchange businesses bought taels from a certain jewelry store for 4,007 yuan. At noon, the situation slightly weakened again. Currency exchange businesses conducted 20 taels of transactions, with a bid price of 1,005 yuan, as the midday closing price. Trading became even scarcer in the afternoon, and the trend was extremely calm. Initially, a gold firm bought 10 taels from a currency exchange business, with the price remaining at 4,005 yuan. Subsequently, a securities firm received dozens of taels from currency exchange businesses for 4,006 yuan and 4,007 yuan. Afterward, another securities firm and a gold firm successively sold 20 taels to currency exchange businesses for 4,005 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, the overall price dropped by four yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day saw only an eight-yuan fluctuation. The selling price of physical gold by cash gold firms was ten yuan higher than the spot gold price, while the purchase price was about thirty yuan lower. The actual gold price was over fifty yuan lower than the listed price, with few transactions.

Jewelry Prices Remain Fixed

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael remained unchanged, as the spot gold trend became increasingly sluggish. Da Tong Heng maintained the original price of 405 yuan per tael, with Xin Tong Heng offering the same price. The purchase price was about fifteen yuan lower.

### Securities Market Firm and Stable

The trading of unified public bonds yesterday was very quiet because various parties are in a wait-and-see position. The price continued to hover without significant fluctuations, coupled with a lack of news. Major investors were reluctant to act, and short-term traders were even less inclined to take risks, resulting in a sluggish market. During the morning session, Lianyi and retail investors actively bought at the opening, causing the price to rise by two or three jiao. Afterward, Hengfu, Datong, Tongji, Yongda, and other firms suddenly began selling, and the buying momentum weakened, causing the price to fall again. The fluctuations narrowed further in the afternoon, and trading was extremely scarce. Only No. 49 and retail investors showed some interest in buying, while only No. 42 and Xingyuan sold slightly more. As a result, the market price uniformly increased by five fen to two jiao, except for 96, which decreased by five fen. The transaction volume was over 440,000 yuan.

Stocks: 60 shares of Wuzhou Pharmacy stock were traded at a price of 49 yuan.

The stock market at the Public Industry Exchange yesterday showed a hidden upward trend, but it lacked the strength to break through the high price of the previous night. The prices of many stocks were strongly supported during slight dips. As a result, the transaction volume slightly decreased. Qinghe Yarn Factory, International Trust Company, Yangzi Silver Company, and Telephone Company stocks were the outstanding performers in yesterday's market. Rubber stocks also experienced good demand.

London, 19th - Reuters: Today's listed prices of British Far East companies were generally calm. However, Kulakk Rubber shares fell by eight pence, remaining at fifteen shillings and seven pence. The rest were unchanged.

London, 19th - Reuters: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable. Prices for all types of bonds remained unchanged.

### Sugar Market Quick Rise, Quick Fall

Yesterday, the sugar market experienced a price drop due to negative foreign news. According to a Dutch telegram, granulated sugar had fallen to 11.33 Dutch guilders. The price of Taikoo B Mark, which was quoted at 14 yuan by the factory the day before, was merely a shouted price. Yesterday, there was an actual price of 16.20 Hong Kong dollars for 2,000 bags. Therefore, the association determined that the recent price increase was excessive, and a correction was underway. The spot price was initially 58 yuan, then 58.5 yuan, and finally 58.8 yuan. Imported sugar fell by 4.5 yuan to 46 yuan. Taikoo Granulated B fell by 2.5 to 3.5 yuan to 62.5 to 61.5 yuan. CW Mark was 61 yuan, XC Mark was 60.5 yuan, DY Mark was 59 yuan, HX Mark was 58.5 yuan, H Mark Grade A was 43.5 yuan, down 1.5 yuan. Dutch Grade A was 44.5 yuan, down 1 yuan. Benmian White Zhenji No. 1 was 58.5 yuan, and No. 1 Ice was 70 yuan. Ming Ice was 71.5 yuan, all down 4 yuan. Subsequently, the market weakened again. Gao Huanggang Qing offered 345 bags at a delivery price of 36 yuan, which was lower than before. Yesterday, 500 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.

### Yarn and Cotton The Bullish Camp in Cotton Yarn Collapses

The yarn market continued to decline, and the downward trend showed no signs of stopping. The situation remained weak because there was still a lack of distinctive sales to customers, and the amount of spot goods in the market felt particularly increased. The foundation of the yarn market became increasingly unstable. As for general trading firms, given the poor actual demand and unfavorable environment, there were very few thoughts of absorbing and increasing their positions. Therefore, Shuangma Brand was taken as the standard. In the past, the bullish forces were particularly strong, so the price increases were unusually large. Recently, this had changed, and the downward trend was particularly strong. In the past, 20-count Tiannv yarn from the same factory had risen by over 100 yuan, but now it was declining daily. This shows that the bullish camp had collapsed. However, raw cotton was still relatively stable.

The opening of the spot yarn market in the morning was disorganized, and few people attended. The market only opened at 10:00 a.m., with a drop of 10 yuan. The price of Shuangma was 680 yuan. Shortly after, selling increased significantly, but sales to customers remained stagnant. The price then fell to 665 yuan. However, speculative buying then resurfaced, causing the price to rebound slightly. By the time of closing, the market was still mediocre. The turnover for half a day was 1,295 bales. The prices of 20-count Shuangma fell by 17 yuan, Tiannv by 15 yuan, and Shuangdiqiu by 12 yuan. The amount of spot yarn purchased by various customer groups is listed below: Fellow Traders: 970 bales, Hong Kong: 35 bales, Inland: 100 bales, Total: 1,295 bales

### Cotton Market Dull

There was no new development in the cotton market, and the market conditions were abnormally quiet. Because the yarn market was declining rapidly, with new lows being discovered step by step, factories were using their existing cotton inventory and had no intention of replenishing raw materials. Therefore, business was very slow. However, Qingdao continued to purchase 32-count raw materials, but the amount was very small. Supply from northern Jiangsu was still maintained. 1,500 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, and 680 bales of northern beach cotton arrived. Today, 540 bales of export cotton were shipped to Hong Kong, with a price reduction of 2 yuan. The sales situation of spot cotton is listed below:

Brazilian Special Grade: 186.00-190.50 yuan, 500 bales to fellow traders

Tongzhou Cotton: 134.00-134.50 yuan, another 400 bales

Another report stated that due to the weakness and sluggishness of yarn prices, factories were calculating the cost based on the current selling price of raw cotton, and each bale would result in a loss of 40-50 yuan. Therefore, the purchase of raw cotton was suspended. The goods in the hands of fellow traders were all high-priced goods from before, so they were temporarily unwilling to sell them. Therefore, trading had been very quiet recently. Only the Qingdao syndicate found the selling price of high-grade Brazilian cotton to be still satisfactory, so they purchased 350 bales yesterday at a price of 186 yuan, which was very cheap.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market opened mixed and appeared weak. Fellow traders were still active, but they were affected by a drop of three to four points in overseas merchants. Later, due to the European situation favoring the bulls and purchases by southern groups in the market, prices soared. As a result, the closing prices increased by seven to eight points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market failed to rally, and yesterday it fell by more than two rupees, including forecasts. Egyptian cotton fell by three to five points. Liverpool rose by three pence.

### Grains Rice Falls and Rises Again

Since the mid-day market for Du Jing rice turned strong yesterday, today started with a surge in arrivals, with over 5,000 bags transported by wagons. This caused a sudden sense of uncertainty, and local merchants were also watching, making it difficult for the market to gain a foothold. It turned downwards, declining all the way. Seeing the weakness, buyers felt discouraged and collectively rushed to sell to avoid losses. As a result, the downward trend intensified. New Jing and Mi Zhong Baige suddenly rose by more than one yuan yesterday, causing an uproar. However, at this price, sales were sluggish, and the reaction was strong. The closing price for new Jing was a huge decrease of 2-3 yuan compared to before, while Yao Zhong Baige fell by about 2 yuan. Bosheng and Chen Xin fell by slightly less, around 1 yuan. Yanglu Jian followed the decline of Jing, falling by 1.5 yuan. Sales of Kejian were slower than Jing in the early market, so it fell by 1 yuan right from the start, declining all the way. Until mid-market, there were even fewer inquiries, and prices fell by half a yuan. Until the market close around noon, local merchants and inland groups suddenly stepped in to buy at low prices, causing a dramatic reversal of the situation, and the market became active again. Therefore, the closing prices were: 12 yuan, up to 30 yuan, Zhong Jue 27-28 yuan, New Jing 29 yuan, Jue to 25.5 yuan, Su Tong Kun Po 26-27 yuan, New Jing 28 yuan to 26 yuan, Qingjiao Yaozhong 30 yuan to 29 yuan, Fengjing Baige 28 yuan, Jue to 26 yuan, Special Yangjian 22.5 yuan, Jue to 20 yuan, Lujian Special 23 yuan, Jue to 21 yuan, Chenbian Yun 31.5 yuan to 31 yuan, Xin Yuan 25-26 yuan, Jiangbei Jian Special 19 yuan, 18.5 yuan, Nanjing No. 1 Jian 19 yuan 45 jiao, No. 2 19-19 yuan, 18.8 jiao, Zhong 18.5 yuan, Sub 18 yuan to 17.5 yuan. The total turnover was over 7,000 bags.

Ke Xian had already shown signs of decline the previous day. Yesterday, because Japanese merchants continued to dump 3,000 bags in total, confidence weakened further. Also, the confiscated rice was completely released, and since the released rice had no unexpected expenses, the damaged rice was sold at a discount in the market, further impacting the Ke Xian market. Prices fell sharply again, by another 1-1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. High Ke Xian was only 19.5 yuan, and Jueji Xian was around 18 yuan. Although the price changes were small, confidence remained weak. However, Chinese merchants transporting goods in Jiangbei and other ports had all stopped because a certain party was deliberately manipulating food prices, wanting to make a fortune off the public.

### Flour Sales to Customers Still Active Wheat Prices High, Supply Scarce

Sales of flour to customers in places such as Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Xiamen continued steadily. However, factories were very firm on their selling prices, and warehouse receipts in the market were already scarce. Therefore, only a small amount was being processed, creating a stalemate in the market. The factory price for No. 2 flour was temporarily unchanged, but the price for goods in transit was 7.1 yuan, still higher than the factory price by a few jiao. It was heard that the recent price of the Phoenix brand from Old Mill was around 6.9 yuan, while the future price was 7.3 yuan. The total turnover for all types of flour was 30,000 bags. Today, 2,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.

The supply of wheat had increased slightly compared to before. However, due to transportation difficulties and high costs, suppliers planned to store the wheat in warehouses and wait for higher prices. Therefore, the amount of wheat circulating in the market was low. However, factories were unwilling to lower prices and buy because current flour prices were difficult to raise. Therefore, the market also tended to become stagnant. As a result, only storage firms purchased two carts of Wuyi and Changzhou wheat, with prices ranging from 10.05 yuan to 10.5 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains Sesame Storage Firms Active Soybeans Remain Stable

Recently, the supply of sesame seeds had been slightly scarce. Although exports were observing, storage firms and those making pure goods were very eager. As a result, the market price was rising due to the tight control of goods by suppliers. Yesterday, Yangzhou sesame had opened at 28.5 yuan, Guantian sesame at 32 yuan, and Wuhu sesame at 30.7 yuan. The total turnover for all types of sesame was over 1,300 bags. Arrivals and sales of soybeans were equally matched, and the market conditions remained stable. Sales were mainly handled by local traders on this street alone, with only a small amount being exported. Today, 985 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea White Silk Prices Soar by 400 Yuan

The silk market in this port is experiencing a rising trend. 7-8 silk yesterday sold at an unprecedented price of 4,700 yuan, a sharp increase of 400 yuan compared to 4,300 yuan two days ago. Six firms in Guoli purchased 100 dan each at a price of 2,400 yuan. In the overseas silk market, Yokohama was closed, but the rising trend in New York remained strong. Recent futures prices rose by 1.2 jiao, and long-term futures prices rose by 0.95 jiao. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk rose by 0.05 yuan, and Japanese silk rose by 0.02-0.05 yuan. The future changes in the silk market tend towards a bullish direction. In this port, most silk mills are currently suspending operations, and production is declining daily due to raw material problems. Market sales (including storage) are indeed rising with the rising silk prices. Therefore, silk prices are likely to reach unprecedented heights.

East White Iron Difficult to Surge

East White Iron, which had been stable for a long time, had risen slightly after the prices of various goods soared. However, its rising trend was not very strong. Yesterday, the price had risen from 7 yuan to 7.3 yuan (for 3-7 chi goods) and from 6 yuan to 6.3 yuan (for 3-6 chi goods), an average increase of 0.3 yuan per sheet compared to before. The main sales channel for this good was local construction, and other foreign merchants such as those from Yangzhou, Wenzhou, Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao also purchased 200-300 bundles.

### Market Conditions Summary

Overseas Silver Prices Continue to Decline: London, 9th - Reuters: The silver market continued to contract. Recent prices contracted by 1.25, and long-term prices contracted by 1.75. There were short covering transactions in the near term, and American merchants sold long-term contracts. Trading was light, and the market was calm. After the close, the market remained stable, with a few transactions at the listed prices. Also, New York: The spot price of American silver contracted by 0.25. Bombay: The spot and near-term prices of Indian silver contracted by 2 annas, and long-term prices contracted by 14 annas. The market was calm, and the transaction volume was 50 contracts.

Discount Rate Exceeds 50 Yuan: The discount rate for bill clearing fluctuated and fell again. The discount rate per 1,000 yuan once fell to a low of 50 yuan. It opened at 55.5 yuan in the morning, then gradually fell to 50 yuan. At noon, it began to rebound to 52.5 yuan. The final price in the afternoon was 53 yuan, a decrease of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The Shanghai Money Trade Association's overnight interest rate remained unchanged at 0.17 yuan.

Foreign Currency Selling Pressure Suddenly Intensifies: Yesterday, the foreign currency market was still not easy to rise. Most people were bearish, and selling pressure was still strong. British gold notes fell again by 0.3 yuan, American gold notes continued to fall by 0.05 yuan, Vietnamese notes also fell by 0.07 yuan, and French franc notes fell by 0.002 yuan. However, Hong Kong notes rose by 0.05 yuan, Japanese gold notes rose by 0.01 yuan, and Korean notes rose sharply, with inter-dealer trades at 1.105 yuan, resulting in a gain of 0.025 yuan. The rest were unchanged.

Hai Feng Coal Transactions Scarce: Hai Feng white coal fell due to the price cut by Hong Ji at the beginning of the month. Foreign storage firms, seeing the unfavorable situation, sold off their holdings, causing the market to feel oversupplied. However, recently, given the tense European war situation and the uncertainty of future goods, traders had become cautious again and were unwilling to sell easily. Therefore, transactions were rare. The listed price for fellow traders' warehouse receipts was 170-180 yuan, while the retail price for screened lumps was 16 yuan per load.

### Japan's Domestic Situation Already Encounters Unprecedented Difficulties US-Japan Relations Deteriorate Trade Stagnates Legislators Question When the War Will End

Pieces of Yang Ge's Talk in Shanghai

The Continental Daily reported that Yang Ge, Far East Manager of International News Agency, residing in Japan, had been in Japan for over ten years. He arrived in Shanghai last Wednesday for a short trip and will return to Japan via North China, Northeast China, and Korea. The reporter interviewed him yesterday (19th). According to him, Japan is currently experiencing a dark period because the country has a severe shortage of raw materials, foreign trade has suffered greatly, the political situation is unstable, and its relations with foreign countries are unfavorable.

Lack of Foreign Exchange Greatest Setback

The collapse of Japan's economic order stems from the fact that the Japanese government sacrificed sound national policies and adopted uneconomical plans for military operations in China. Japan has deeply felt or will soon feel the shortage of many items, including coal, electricity, and water. However, the most serious setback hindering Japan's economic system is the lack of foreign exchange, which prevents it from purchasing imported goods from foreign countries.

Soybean Exports to Germany Come to a Halt

The industrial program that Japan is undertaking in the Northeast has been severely hit by Europe. This is because the export of soybeans from the Northeast has been cut off from at least half of its markets due to the European war. Exports have decreased by 4 million tons. These 4 million tons of soybeans were originally intended to be exported to Germany under a commercial agreement signed between "Manchukuo" and Germany. The agreement was scheduled to take effect on October 1st, but it was suspended due to the war. Therefore, the hope of the Northeast obtaining machinery and other necessary imports from Germany has been thwarted and they have been forced to turn to countries such as the United States to obtain the machinery they need. However, neither the Northeast nor Japan can afford this because they have no foreign exchange to pay for the goods.

Foreign Minister Nomura Constantly Hindered

American merchants will not sell their products to Japan without cash. The abolition of the 1911 US-Japan commercial agreement was a serious blow to Japan's economic power. Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura is a personal friend of US President Roosevelt. The Japanese people now hope that Nomura can resolve the outstanding issues between the US and Japan. Nomura's work will be greatly hindered by the different views of "certain parties."

The United States Rejects Japanese Goods

At the same time, the Japanese business community, in view of the recent commercial and diplomatic developments between the United States and Japan, is now worried that the United States will soon refuse to ship any goods to Japan. In the two weeks before he left Japan, it was rumored that the US Treasury Department would soon stop purchasing all of Japan's gold and silver, including those obtained by Japanese in North China. In addition, some American manufacturers have canceled large orders placed by Japanese merchants. Japanese buyers are reluctant to pay cash at increased prices, but American manufacturers still cancel their orders.

Tourism Also Declines

Even Japan's tourism trade is now close to zero because Japanese police authorities impose strict restrictions on tourists visiting Japan. Therefore, there are very few foreigners visiting Japan. He had recently traveled in western Japan and was questioned by five police detectives in less than 200 miles. There are currently 80 detectives in the area engaged in monitoring tourists, and another 70 will soon be added. The reason is that the area is rapidly industrializing and manufacturing military supplies. The Japanese government recently invited 150 American news reporters, magazine writers, and businessmen to visit Japan. When they left Japan, they all expressed dissatisfaction with the inconveniences they had encountered.

Actively Publicizing War Will End Soon

The Japanese government is conducting extensive propaganda work, saying that the war in China has a bright future and constantly reminding people not to forget that the war will end soon and that a "new order" is about to be established. This propaganda work is believed to have given the Japanese people a favorable impression. Although the Japanese government has repeatedly assured that the war will end in the "near future," it is expected that some leaders will soon question the government as to when the war will end. It is now expected that the question will be raised to the government by veteran members of parliament Ozaki and Saito. When Congress reconvenes next January, these two political leaders will express their opinions on government policy. Mr. Yang concluded by saying that he would not be surprised if the current cabinet collapsed and Konoe was brought back to serve as prime minister because only Konoe can now spur on "certain parties." Under Konoe's leadership, Japan may be forced to reach some definite understandings with China and the United States.

### British Troops Armed Patrol Outside the Boundary

The English-language "China Press" reported that British troops in a truck patrolled the roads outside the boundary, near where police officers had been assaulted, this morning (20th). The vehicle was equipped with a Bren machine gun manned by a gunner, as well as eight other soldiers armed with rifles. They closely monitored police officers patrolling the roads outside the British zone.

### The Lanchang Labor Strike Negotiation Underway Not at an Impasse

The Continental Daily reported that senior officials of the British-owned Lanchang Company denied reports yesterday morning (19th) that negotiations to resolve the strikes at the Lanchang factories in Pudong were at an impasse. According to reports, negotiations between representatives of the company and the workers are still ongoing. However, the official did not anticipate what the outcome of the negotiations would be.

### Yu Yuan Road and Yidingpan Road Chinese and Indian Police Ambushed Chinese Policeman Dies Indian Policeman in Critical Condition

At the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Yidingpan Road, the Zujie (Concession) Police Department's Jing'an Temple precinct not only assigned Chinese police to manage the policing of that section but also assigned an Indian policeman to assist. The "Greater Shanghai Municipal Government" also sent four or five pseudo-"police" officers to direct traffic and manage the traffic lights. At around 7:00 PM yesterday, Chinese policeman No. 3378 and Indian policeman No. 459 were on duty when they were suddenly shot and wounded by thugs from the darkness. The Chinese and Indian policemen were very close to the pseudo-"police" officers at the time, but the "police" officers escaped unscathed. At the same time, there were four other pseudo-"police" officers standing guard nearby. Instead of helping to apprehend the assailants, the "police" officers left first. The Jing'an Temple precinct received the report and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to apprehend the assailants, and British troops also dispatched a squad of soldiers to assist, but no clues were found. The wounded Chinese and Indian policemen were rushed to the General Hospital for treatment. However, the Chinese policeman died upon arrival at the hospital because the bullet had entered his abdomen and exited through his back, causing severe injuries. The Indian policeman was shot in the chest, but the bullet did not exit. He is in critical condition and is being treated.

### Displaced Refugees Have Been Resettled Temporarily Residing in Refugee Children's Middle School

The 31st Refugee Shelter on Jessfield Road was established by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association of Avenue Edward VII. Since the issue of building roads beyond the boundaries arose, the association had been trying to relocate the shelter to prevent further incidents. However, due to the difficulty of finding open space within the boundaries, it was unable to do so for a while. It was then learned that the shelter on Dunsing Road still had room to build sheds, so Mr. Kuai Yanfang negotiated with the association to take them in. Unexpectedly, the pseudo-police impatiently seized the shelter. Fortunately, two new buildings had just been built there this summer as school buildings for refugee children. In this emergency, the association actively handled the evacuation and moved some of the elderly and weak refugees to the school. After the sheds on Dunsing Road are completed, they will be moved there. As of press time, the refugees at the shelter were still being supplied with food as usual, and the order was still good.

Another report stated that according to a report from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department on the 19th of this month, there were 29 refugee shelters inspected by the department within the concession, housing a total of 38,158 refugees.

### Jiading Bank Officially Opens Priority Shares Fully Subscribed

The Jiading Bank held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at its new address at 966 Avenue Edward VII yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Chairman of the Board Fan Liangbo first reported the purpose of the meeting and that the 100,000 yuan of 8% priority shares had been fully subscribed by new and old shareholders. Then, the discussion on the scheduled opening of the bank began. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to open on November 14th.

### The United States Still Celebrates Navy Day of Great Significance Does Not Change Traditional Attitude Due to the European War The USS Augusta Will Host American僑民

The North China Daily News reported that the development of the United States Navy, which is now only second in strength to the British, is largely due to former US President Theodore Roosevelt from 1901 to 1904. Therefore, his birthday, October 27th, was designated as US Navy Day. Now, with the Second World War underway in Europe, the American people's celebration of Navy Day this year is of great significance. Although the US Navy authorities have issued new regulations prohibiting the release of information about naval operations and preventing espionage, it is generally believed that the US Navy will still commemorate Navy Day in the traditional way and invite Americans to "board the ship and see your navy." The flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, will be open to American expatriates in this port for tours on the scheduled time of US Navy Day, next Friday, unless Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, issues an order to the contrary.

### Arrest of Master Yuan Ying: Signs Were Present Beforehand; Rumor of Japanese Plans to Organize a Japan-China Buddhist Association; Yuan Ying's Refusal to Serve as Chairman May Be the Reason for His Abduction

Master Yuan Ying, Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was suddenly abducted at 0:30 PM the day before yesterday from the Yuanming Lecture Hall at 443 Daxi Road. His whereabouts remain unknown, causing great shock within the Shanghai Buddhist community. The details of this incident are described as follows:

Native of Fujian

Master Yuan Ying was a native of Gutian County, Fujian Province.

He was 62 years old this year. At the age of 19, he became a monk at Yongquan Temple on Shigu Mountain in Fujian. He subsequently served as the chief monk at Jietan Temple, Tiantong Temple, and Qita Temple in Ningbo, Zhejiang. This is why some mistakenly believed he was from Yin County.

Leadership Position

He has long been known in the Buddhist community as a conservative, in contrast to the reformer Master Taixu. However, in the eight years since the establishment of the Chinese Buddhist Association, Master Yuan Ying held the position of Chairman for seven terms, except for the first term when Master Taixu held the position. He held the position of lifelong leader in the Buddhist community, demonstrating his influence among monks and laity. Some say he was a disciple of Master Taixu, but they are completely unaware of the situation in the Buddhist community.

Visited Southeast Asia

After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the two Buddhist leaders, the old and the new, parted ways. Taixu went elsewhere, while Yuan Ying went abroad to Singapore to preach. The Kek Lok Si Temple in Singapore was originally a branch of Yongquan Temple on Gushan Mountain in Fujian, and he was currently the chief monk (i.e., abbot) of Yongquan Temple. Therefore, he resided there until he returned to Shanghai in July of this year. He originally planned to return to Singapore after the Mid-Autumn Festival, but the sudden outbreak of the European war delayed his trip, leading to his abduction.

Signs Beforehand

Master Yuan Ying built the Yuanming Lecture Hall at 443 Daxi Road, which served as his residence and place for lecturing. Since returning to Shanghai in July, Yuan Ying had lectured there many times. Recently, after hearing rumors that someone was planning something against him, he removed the plaque outside the lecture hall and stopped lecturing as a precautionary measure, which was quite thorough.

Sudden Abduction

The day before yesterday happened to be the period for the Buddhist Seven ceremony at the lecture hall. Starting in the morning, more than 30 men and women who respected Buddhism gathered there. Yuan Ying then led his disciple, Ming Yang (30 years old, also from Fujian), to the hall. As they were preparing to offer alms and have lunch, seven or eight men in Western suits, armed with pistols (among them, it seemed there were one or two Chinese, the rest were Japanese), suddenly broke in, drove the crowd upstairs, and then took Yuan Ying and his disciple Ming Yang away in a car.

Speculations on the Reason

As of this morning, the Chinese Buddhist Association and the Yuanming Lecture Hall have not yet learned of their whereabouts. However, according to Buddhist figures, before this incident occurred, the Japanese planned to organize a "Japan-China Buddhist Association," with the "headquarters" in Tokyo. Now, in areas that have been occupied, such as Hangzhou, there are "branches." At the time, they were brewing to coerce Yuan Ying to serve as "Chairman," but he was ultimately rejected. Therefore, this abduction is clearly related to this matter.

Western Newspaper Reports

The Shanghai Times reported that Master Yuan Ying, Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was arrested yesterday (the 19th) at around 2:30 PM by a group of plainclothes Japanese at the Yuanming Lecture Hall at the corner of Daxi Road and Yidingpan Road and taken to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters at 94 Jessfield Road. He was accused of raising 100,000 yuan in this city during the war to be used by the Chinese government for the war of resistance against Japan. Master Yuan Ying admitted to raising 100,000 yuan and other large sums of money, but insisted that the money was never used for military expenses but to help wounded soldiers. Chinese Buddhist leaders are trying to rescue Master Yuan Ying, but as of last night, he was still being detained by the Japanese.

### British Couple Detained by Puppet Police; Released After More Than Three Hours

The North China Daily News reported that Mr. and Mrs. Abbott, British employees of Butterfield & Swire, were detained by police of the "Special Municipality" on Wednesday. Yesterday (the 19th), a detailed report was prepared and submitted to the British Consulate. Mr. Abbott was detained for three hours and forty-five minutes, while his wife was detained for a shorter time. The incident occurred on Wednesday when Mr. and Mrs. Abbott were riding horses near Warren Road on Daxi Road.

Frightened by a passing car, Mr. Abbott's horse bumped into a Chinese man on a bicycle, causing a scratch on one of the man's fingers. Three police officers from the "Special Municipality" arrived at the scene, none of whom spoke English. Therefore, Mr. and Mrs. Abbott could not explain to them, but they still tried to tell them that they wanted to return to the roadblock on Daxi Road to find an interpreter.

Mr. and Mrs. Abbott eventually went with the three policemen to the British defense zone. A British sentry, realizing the predicament of the two foreigners, notified a Western police officer of the Shanghai Municipal Police, who reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and the British military headquarters. At the same time, several police officers from the "Special Municipality" and a police officer arrived at the scene. Mrs. Abbott attempted

to cross the barricade

and enter the British defense zone, but an officer of the "Special Municipality" grabbed Mrs. Abbott's arm and prevented her from entering. Later, a foreigner intervened, and Mrs. Abbott was able to drag her horse across the barricade and enter the British defense zone. Mr. Abbott was taken to the "Special Municipality Police Station" on Daxi Road for questioning and was not

allowed to return home until 2:45 PM.

### Establishment of Laboratories in Shanghai Must Be Approved; Trademark Bureau's Approval Document Arrives in Shanghai

The National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and other three organizations, previously due to the fact that their member manufacturers were separated from the Central Health Administration in Chongqing by transportation obstacles, resulting in difficulties in submitting various new drugs for testing, and trademark registration was also subject to twists and turns. The associations jointly requested the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to approve the establishment of temporary health testing laboratories in Shanghai by the associations, etc., to hire experts to preside over the testing affairs. After obtaining qualified proof, they would apply to the Trademark Bureau for registration. Once transportation was restored, they would immediately cancel the laboratories and the Central Health Administration would be responsible. It was learned yesterday that the Trademark Bureau had issued a reply to Shanghai, believing that if the Shanghai Association could submit the proof documents of the Health Administration to the bureau, it could be approved.

### French Consulate General Begins Signing Visas for Goods from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia Detained in Haiphong; Extension Difficult to Approve, Merchants Should Pay Attention; Haiphong Chamber of Commerce Sends Personnel to Shanghai

The Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, under the order of Chinese Consul Liu in Haiphong, specially sent Wu Bomin and Chen Shanzhi to Shanghai to contact French Consul General Baudic in Shanghai regarding the release of goods from Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria detained in Haiphong, requesting that they be accommodated to avoid harming Chinese merchants' capital. The French Consul in Shanghai agreed to accommodate them and agreed on the procedures for handling visa applications. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. After Wu and Chen contacted the French Consul, the French Consul did not approve the request for continued extension of registration and still instructed Shanghai merchants to complete registration as soon as possible by the 31st of this month. Those who do not register after this deadline will be treated as goods from Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria and confiscated.

The order has begun for handling visas.

The French Consulate General in Shanghai has approved the request of the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce to handle visas for goods from Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria in Haiphong and has already begun to implement it yesterday. All cargo owners who are Chinese merchants are requested to quickly apply to the French Consulate for visa release. The deadline is the end of this month. Those who request a visa must bring proof documents, such as payment receipts and invoices. If visa procedures are not completed after the deadline, the Haiphong authorities will designate them as enemy goods and confiscate them. This matter concerns the costs of Chinese merchants, so please do not ignore it to avoid unexpected losses.

Requesting an extension

According to Wu and Chen, they have come to Shanghai to contact the French side to handle the release of goods detained in Haiphong and have met with French Consul General Baudic several times. However, regarding the request to continue extending the registration deadline for handling visas, the French Consulate has only approved the deadline to be the end of this month. Because the matter is of great concern to the interests of Shanghai Chinese merchants, they have repeatedly proposed it, but have not been able to get to the bottom of it. Therefore, it is not certain that they will be able to extend it again after the end of this month. They plan to return to Haiphong within the next few days to report the results of the negotiations in Shanghai to the authorities for approval.

Merchants' losses are astonishing.

The number of various goods purchased by Shanghai importers from Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria is quite large. After the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on September 3, the goods detained by France in Haiphong amounted to no less than 70,000 to 80,000 tons, of which about 60% belonged to Shanghai Chinese merchants. The goods have been hoarded there for nearly two months, and the merchants' economy has been stranded, and their suffering is difficult to express. Now that the authorities have approved the release of the goods, the general importers are overjoyed to hear about it. Therefore, today they are asking about transportation methods in order to ship them as soon as possible for sales and avoid losses. However, the French Consulate has limited the registration to be completed before the end of this month, and those who do not register after the deadline will be confiscated. Therefore, they are still requesting a further extension, but it is difficult to predict whether it will be approved. In short, it is hoped that importers will not be too negligent and go to register as soon as possible to avoid invisible losses. If they are confiscated, the amount of losses will be astonishing.

Dispatching staff to Shanghai

The Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce has now decided to send four people to Shanghai to liaise with Shanghai importers on everything. Two people are stationed at the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road, and two people are stationed at the Sino-French Express Company at No. 66 Nong 2, Jiangxi Road, and the Sino-South Express Company on Jiujiang Road. In addition, in order to facilitate commercial transportation, the Sino-French Express Company has opened another transportation line. For goods from Shanghai and Hong Kong that are to be transported to Kunming and then transferred to the interior, they can go through Saigon and directly to Kunming. The company has only been operating for three months, and the goods have reached five or six batches, each batch weighing nearly a thousand tons. Since the goods are shipped from Shanghai, they have never taken more than 40 days to arrive in Kunming. It has now signed a joint transportation agreement with Kunming Guohua United Transportation Company for Chongqing and Guiyang. If merchants want to transfer goods to Chongqing and Guiyang, they can directly contact the Shanghai-Hong Kong Sino-French Express Company, which can reach Guiyang in seven days and Chongqing in ten days.

### United Church Committee of America Relief Fund; 2.75 Million Yuan Stored in New York; For Use by American Advisory Committee

The Continental Daily News reported that, according to the American Advisory Committee stationed in Shanghai by the United Church Committee in China Relief Committee, despite the war in Europe, the United Church Committee unanimously decided to continue its fundraising campaign to carry out relief work in China and has stored more than 2.75 million yuan in legal currency in New York for the use of the American Advisory Committee, which proves the effectiveness of the United Church Committee's work last year and the assistance of the American church. It was also reported that refugee relief organizations in Shanghai received a telegram from the American branch a few days ago, stating that after the United States expressed neutrality in the outbreak of the European war, it still sympathized with the situation of European Jewish refugees in Shanghai.

The association, together with the Red Cross European Refugee Relief Association in Woodberry, mobilized fundraising two weeks ago to appeal for the refugees in China.

### Twelve Women's Fashion Stores Resumed Work One After Another; About 20 More Are Still Under Negotiation

After the workers of women's fashion and ready-made clothing companies in the Fuzhou Road area went on strike due to the failure of their request for improved treatment, in addition to the 18 companies including Rixin that resumed work on the 18th, Changxing, Hetai, Yongxin, Meizuishi, Yongxiangchun, Shanghai Lao Jiulun, China National Goods Company, Lixingxiang, Xie Feng, and other ten companies also resumed work yesterday after labor and management negotiated on their own and accepted the labor's demands. The minimum wage was 3.5 yuan per piece, and a contract was signed, so more than 100 workers from the ten companies also resumed work yesterday. Xin Guang and Huangjia also accepted the demands, but refused to sign a contract, but the workers have been working as usual. The remaining 20 companies, including Maoli, Meili, Daxin, Meihua, Zhongyang, Yixin, Kangxin, Huahua, Fuxing, Hongshang, Zhengchangxiang, New Life, Da Zhonghua, Huali, Huada, Dahua, Xinxin, Fengxiang, Tianxiang, and Dadong, are still in stalemate.

It was decided to continue negotiations this afternoon.

### Empress Liner Operates As Usual; Japanese Empress Arrives in Shanghai Today; Shirala Enters Port Tomorrow Morning

Since the outbreak of war in Europe, the British Nan Changxing Shipping Company has followed orders from the British military to keep the schedules of its ships strictly secret to avoid accidents en route. After the company implemented secret schedules for its ships, it issued a notice to avoid misunderstandings with the outside world, stating that the Empress liner operates as usual, is well-equipped, and provides attentive service, with Chinese attendants to welcome guests. The company's

Japanese Empress

mail ship was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 17th of this month, but due to delays in departing from Vancouver, the arrival date has also been delayed. It is said that it should arrive in Shanghai at 5:00 PM today and is scheduled to dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will transfer to the company's prepared small wheel at about 6:30 PM to land at the New Customs Wharf.

### Portuguese Ship "Dadre" Forced to Change Flag; Portuguese Merchants Express Regret

The Portuguese ship Deyao, represented by the Italian business association Yi Hua Yanghang in this city, was detained by the Japanese Maritime Police on the morning of the 6th of this month. While negotiations were underway, the case was suddenly transferred to the Japanese Navy for handling, and the detention was officially announced. It is now learned that the ship has been moved to the heart of the Yangshupu River the day before yesterday. Although the Portuguese Consul made strong representations, demanding its release, it was unsuccessful. Also, the Portuguese ship Dadre, which was previously detained, has been taken over and cooperated with by the Japanese side and has changed to the Japanese flag. It may be released soon. Portuguese merchants generally expressed regret.

### Aohan Road's Departure and Arrival Stations Shortened; Xiang-Gui Railway Revised Timetable; Xiang-Heng Highway Temporarily Suspended

Currently, due to the war in northern Hunan, the Yuehan Railway is busy with military transportation, and Zhuzhou Station has been closed and temporarily uses Lukou (only one station away from Zhuzhou) and Qujiang (i.e., Shaozhou) as the departure and arrival stations. At the same time, the highway traffic between Changsha and Hengyang has also been temporarily suspended. The Xiang-Gui Railway, from October 1, changed the 21st and 22nd express trains between Hengyang and Guilin to 11th and 12th special express trains (with sleeping car facilities). They depart from Hengyang at 6:30 PM every day and arrive in Guilin at 7:00 AM the next day. They depart from Guilin at 6:30 PM every day and arrive in Hengyang at 7:05 AM the next day. In addition to the special express train, the 41st and 42nd ordinary express trains still run between Hengyang and Guilin every day, with first, second, and third class passenger cars and dining cars. The journey between Hengyang and Guilin takes 26 hours. There are also regional mixed trains on the Heng-Leng (i.e., Lengshuitan) and Leng-Gui sections, which are convenient for travelers. The ordinary express train ticket prices on the line, from Hengyang to Guilin, are 5.25 yuan in national currency for third class, 10.5 yuan for second class, and 15.75 yuan for first class. The surcharge for special trains is 0.6 yuan per 100 kilometers or less for first class, 0.3 yuan for second class, and 0.15 yuan for third class. The distance from Hengyang to Guilin is 360 kilometers, which can be calculated by mileage. If you take the special express train, the berth ticket prices are 3.5 yuan for the upper berth of first class, 4.5 yuan for the lower berth, 2.5 yuan for the upper berth of second class, 3 yuan for the lower berth, 1 yuan for the upper berth of third class, 1.2 yuan for the middle berth, and 1.5 yuan for the lower berth.

### This City's Land Registers Still Kept by the Shanghai Municipal Council; Puppet Regime's Request for Return is Purely One-Sided Propaganda; Shanghai Municipal Council Continues to Be Responsible and Has Not Considered It

Regarding the land title deeds and conveyance deeds of this city, after the Nationalist army moved west, because these registers are the foundation of the citizens' property rights and there are a large number of them, the local government sent them to the Shanghai Municipal Council for safekeeping through formal procedures. After more than a year, the Shanghai Municipal Council, having been entrusted in advance, will definitely return them after a proper solution. However, recently, the puppet "Land Bureau" suddenly issued a notice to handle the so-called "Land Reporting" in this city, and on the one hand, it has been claiming that it is negotiating with the Shanghai Municipal Council to return these registers. According to sources familiar with the matter, this attempt by the puppet regime is only a one-sided hope. In fact, the Shanghai Municipal Council has not considered it at all. The applicant for return is not the agency that requested safekeeping at the time, and the Consular Body must have a legal basis for dealing with it. The fact that the Special District Court is still performing its duties as usual is clear evidence of this. Therefore, these rumors are all one-sided propaganda by the puppet regime and will definitely not be realized.

### Japanese Ships on the Yangtze River Run in Sections; "Military Tickets" Required to Go to Hankou; Guerrilla Areas Are Affected

After the Yangtze River route between Shanghai and Hankou was occupied by the Japanese army, there is still no hope for foreign merchant ships to resume sailing. However, the transportation of Japanese ships is very prosperous. The Yangtze River route was previously operated exclusively by the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, but has now been reorganized into the Japanese-owned East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. It is said that the entire Yangtze River line will be divided into sections, such as the Shanghai-Nanjing line, the Shanghai-Wuhu line, the Shanghai-Jiujiang line, and the Shanghai-Hankou line. Chinese passengers can now go to Jiujiang, but those going to Hankou must be approved by the "Military Department" before boarding the ship. Ticket prices are calculated in Japanese currency. It is now learned that the company recently announced that Japanese and Chinese legal tenders are not accepted upstream of Anqing (i.e., all places above Anqing) and that "military tickets" (i.e., military currency) must be used. Chinese legal tender will be rejected. This move by the Japanese shows the financial difficulties of Japan, but the guerrilla areas upstream will be severely affected.

### Super Giant Liners on the Pacific Ocean: U.S. President Lines Company to Solicit Bids for Construction; Tonnage Exceeds That of the Japanese Empress

A Mainland Press report states that the U.S. President Lines Company will next month solicit bids for the construction of three super-class passenger and cargo liners of 41,000 tons each. According to current plans, these three liners will sail between Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu, various ports in Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila, and then return to the United States via the original route.

Rumors Have Persisted for Nearly a Year

Since hearing that the United States Maritime Commission planned to build 500 new ships over a period of ten years or more to replace old merchant ships, rumors have been circulating on both sides of the Pacific that the United States is building super-class giant liners, for nearly a year. The construction period for these three liners will last three years, but after they begin operations, the size and speed of all other ships on the Pacific will not be able to match them. Furthermore, the three liners will surpass the 39,000-ton "Japanese Empress" giant liner. The three liners have not yet been named, but each will be 740 feet long, have 65,000 horsepower, a speed of 26 knots per hour, and a capacity of 985 passengers, with exceptionally luxurious facilities.

Six New Liners to Circumnavigate the Globe

However, long before these three liners begin operating, the U.S. President Lines Company will have six smaller liners of 16,190 tons each, with a maximum speed of 16.5 knots and a length of 492 feet, completed for circumnavigating the globe. One of them, named the Sea Arrow, was launched in July and may arrive in Shanghai on its maiden voyage in August next year. It is expected that its five sister ships will begin bi-weekly round-the-world service. The United States Maritime Commission plans to send a total of twenty new liners to operate regularly in the Far East. This plan is not far from realization.

Maritime Commission's Overall Plan

As with the Puchi Sant Dongfang Shipping Company (transliterated) freighter "Kurt Block" arriving in Shanghai on Wednesday, initiating tri-weekly cargo service departing from the West Coast of the United States, sister ships include the "Sata Tia," "Capilillo," and "Colin House." The "Sata Tia" arrived in the Far East three weeks ago but did not call at Shanghai, while the other two liners will regularly serve the Far East following the "Kurt Block." It is reported that cargo space on the "Kurt Block" was pre-booked by American shipping companies several weeks ago, and the 2,000 tons of cargo brought to Shanghai were mostly timber. As for the remaining seven of the twenty liners designated by the Maritime Commission to operate in the Far East, the decision is pending.

### Heinous Parricide Case: Two Sons Sentenced to Death, Their Mother to Two and a Half Years in Prison

The Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qixiang parricide case in Red Flower Cave, which shocked the nation with its inhumanity, has concluded its trial in the First Special District Court, as detailed in this newspaper. The facts will not be repeated. Yesterday morning, the case was scheduled for sentencing. Men and women concerned about the case flocked to the court to hear the verdict, and before 9:00 AM, Courtroom Two of the First Special Court was packed, with no space left. Defense lawyers Yang Linzhi, Yang Sicheng, Ye Shaoying, and assistant lawyer Jiang Baolian were all present to await the verdict. At 9:30 AM, the presiding judge Fu Lin, accompanied by the court clerk, took his seat, and the court police immediately brought Zhou Qinji, Zhou Qixiang, and Zhou Jing to the court. After Judge Fu asked the three defendants for their names, he stood up and announced

The Judgment

Both defendants are sentenced to death for the murder of a direct blood relative of senior lineage, and are deprived of their civil rights for life. Zhou Jing is sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for aiding in the damaging of the body. One screwdriver, one saw, two wires, one crowbar, one kitchen knife, and one rope are confiscated. The passbook, seal, and 40 yuan in cash are temporarily kept by the assistant police until the heirs of the deceased (Zhou Yongjie) are determined, and then handed over. After the sentence was read, Judge Fu announced the gist of the reasoning for the judgment, stating that although the motive for the murder by defendants Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qixiang was to save their mother, the deceased was their

Own Father

Furthermore, the two defendants received a considerable education, and after murdering their father, they heartlessly dismembered his body. Regardless of their motive, their malicious intentions and cruel methods are unforgivable and warrant the most severe punishment. As for Zhou Jing, when her husband was attacked and cried out, she heard the cries but did not investigate. One must know that the cries of a person near death are entirely different from the scolding during ordinary quarrels, and her claim of ignorance is unbelievable. However, according to the defendant's testimony, she did not participate in the pre-planning, and Zhou Qinji and others also testified that the discussion took place in French Park. Therefore, it is difficult to conclusively prove her participation in the aiding of the murder based on the evidence, but

After Her Husband's Death

When the two sons discussed dismembering the body, the discussion took place in Zhou Jing's room, and the keys to the room where Zhou Qinji and others dismembered the body were in her possession. Therefore, she clearly aided in the damaging of the body. The sentence was reduced by one-third in accordance with the law. If the defendants do not accept the sentence, they may appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court within ten days after receiving the judgment. After the announcement, the three defendants were taken down by the police and sent to prison for execution. If the three defendants do not accept the verdict, they will still commission the original defending lawyers to file an appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court.

Kidnapping for Ransom

Three Bandits Convicted

Wu Agu's eleven-year-old son, Wu Guorong, residing at No. 5 Niao Qiao Tu, Xinzha Road, Suzhou Wangting, was kidnapped by bandits at noon on August 30 at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Park Road, who demanded a ransom of 5,000 yuan. Later, detective chief Wang Jiaju and Pang Ruiqing of the Lao Zha Police Department apprehended the suspects Xue Kuoming, Zhou Bin, Wu Peng, Wu Shengwu, Mao Apan, and others, and rescued the victim in Pudong. The case was legally prosecuted by police lawyer Ru Bao to the First Special Court, and the trial has concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide announced the verdict: Xue Guanming and Zhou Xin were each sentenced to thirteen years of imprisonment and deprived of their civil rights for ten years. Wu Peng was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for eight years. Wu Shengwu and Mao Apan were found not guilty. Four threatening letters were confiscated.

### Scenic Southwest

The Dynamic Appearance of the Southwest is Fully Revealed

Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the southwestern provinces have undergone vigorous development and construction under the government's efforts, and various undertakings have been flourishing. The China Travel Service, in order to reveal the full picture of the southwestern provinces and their mountain and river scenery, spent more than half a year collecting scenic photographs and images of various local undertakings from various parts of the southwest, which are compiled into a "Scenic Southwest" painting book, with the aim of presenting the southwestern appearance to readers. The entire book is about 200 pages, with more than 200 copperplate illustrations, printed on high-quality paper. The cover is a color painting, and the appearance and content are outstanding. It can be called the only masterpiece since the Sino-Japanese Incident. Moreover, most of the illustrations in the entire book are provided by the famous photographer Mr. Lang Jingshan. The composition and lighting are excellent, making it even more valuable. It is reported that there are two types of editions, a deluxe edition and a popular edition. The popular edition is sold at a price of four national currency units. It is only retailed at the store in this city. The distributors are the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road and its branches in various districts, as well as the Western painting stores of Bye, Sino-American, Evans, and Dahua.

### Lawyer Appointed but Fails to Appear in Court; Introducer Beaten and Injured; Three Defendants Detained and Granted Bail

Zhu Deben, a 49-year-old salt merchant residing at No. 103 Qian Hu Jia Zhai in the Xujiahui area of Shanghai, had a son detained by the Public Security Bureau and brought to the First Special Court for trial on a theft charge. Yang Anming (29 years old), a Chongming native residing at No. 62 next door, offered to introduce lawyer Shi Youfu (principal of Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, No. 162 Fuxi Road) to defend him. Yang requested a fee of 220 yuan, which Zhu paid in advance. Yang then gave Zhu a business card of lawyer Shi Youfu. Zhu agreed to pay the remaining 120 yuan after his son's case was concluded. However, during the three court hearings in the First Special Court, no lawyer appeared to defend him, and as a result, he was sentenced to 18 years of imprisonment. Upon hearing the news, Zhu Deben urgently negotiated with the introducer Yang Anming, who was evasive. Zhu then invited Wang Guoquan and Gao Wanyong, who lived with him, to Yang's house to reason with him. They disagreed and fought, resulting in Yang being beaten and injured. The Xujiahui Police Department was notified and sent detectives to arrest Zhu, Wang, and Gao. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the Eighth Court of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Yao Zhaodi explained the case and filed charges for assault. Since the plaintiff had not arrived, Judge Zhu Chuzhe questioned the defendants and ordered a postponement to the 24th to summon the plaintiff for questioning. The defendants were granted bail pending review.

### Japanese Side Inducing Chinese Laborers to Serve in the Military

Five Hundred People Shipped from Shanghai to Qingdao Yesterday

According to Hua Ji News Agency, the Japanese army, facing a shortage of soldiers, has specially organized the so-called Qingdao Joint Venture Company's Mainland Chinese Labor Company, which specializes in inducing unemployed Chinese laborers from various places to serve in the military. They have successively sent personnel to set up labor recruitment offices in Shanghai, Suzhou, Danyang Town, and other places, specializing in recruiting carpenters and mechanics, offering a daily wage of 2.5 yuan for workers, 4 yuan for foremen, and 1.5 yuan for junior workers, as bait. They also claim to provide food and lodging and advance 10 yuan as a settlement fee, using all possible methods of enticement, so that those who are deceived and enter the trap are countless. Recently, a large number of laborers, about 500, in the Hongkew area have registered in response to the call. It is reported that the purpose of the recruitment is only to repair the bridges and road surfaces destroyed between Qingdao and Jinan. Those who respond do not know the details and are unaware that they are being recruited to serve in the military.

### Gun Threat Against Silver Company Manager Case: Both Parties Offer Conflicting Accounts; Defendant Files Counterclaim; Court Orders Case Closed Awaiting Judgment

Zhang Lingyun, a Ningbo native, 23 years old, manager of Yongcheng Silver Company, which lends money at high interest rates, located in Room 241 of the Zhonghui Building, hired lawyer Sun Shian to represent him in a case in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Bi Haomin, a Zhejiang native residing at No. 420 Siming Village, Fuxi Road (owner of Bide Xing Oilskin Shop, No. 35 Luban Road), for

Forcible Coercion and Intimidation with a Firearm

According to the plaintiff, Yongcheng Silver Company requested the court on August 4 to seal up the movable property in the house at No. 130 Magill Road, owned by the debtor Mao Wenlong, as collateral. At 2:00 PM on the same day, the defendant suddenly arrived with Mao Linshu, claiming that the sealed movable property had been transferred by Mao Wenlong to Mao Linshu, and demanded immediate unsealing. They also ordered the plaintiff to go to a lawyer's office to issue blank papers and have the plaintiff sign them and submit them to the court for unsealing.

The Plaintiff Refused

Upon returning to the company, the defendant also followed, using violent and coercive means, taking out his own firearm to threaten and pressure the plaintiff to sign, threatening to kill him if he refused. Li Linshu stopped and dissuaded him. A request was made for a legal investigation. Based on the petition, Judge Wu Kechou held a hearing, and the defendant Bi Haomin hired two lawyers, Wu Linkun and Xiao Baichuan, to defend him. He denied threatening with a firearm and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The hearing was postponed to summon witnesses for further questioning, as reported in previous newspapers.

Another Hearing Was Held Yesterday Morning

According to the defendant Bi Haomin, when I went to the plaintiff's office to negotiate, the plaintiff was standing inside the counter, and I was outside. The plaintiff hit me first. I wanted to hit him back, but I didn't hit him. It was hot that day, and I was wearing a suit. Because I was hit, I leaned over to avoid it, which exposed the firearm I was carrying, but there was no intention to threaten with it. The witness Zhu Huiming, presented by the plaintiff, testified that he was working at the British Consulate. He went to the plaintiff's company on that day to negotiate a loan and saw the plaintiff being pushed out from behind the counter, and the defendant was outside the counter trying to get inside.

Both Men Used Their Fists

The judge asked if Zhu had seen the defendant holding a firearm. He answered that he had not seen a firearm. The witness Li Linshu testified that he was a partner in the Bide Xing Oilskin Shop and also did business in military uniforms. On that day, he accompanied the defendant to the plaintiff's office. There were verbal disputes between the two parties, but the defendant did not threaten with a firearm. According to Liu Songtang, on August 4, he went to the plaintiff's office for business and saw the plaintiff and defendant arguing over the unsealing issue. The court reviewed the testimony and determined that the case was clear, and ordered closing arguments.

The Plaintiff's Attorney Presented Arguments

Requesting that the defendant be convicted and punished according to law. The defendant's attorney Wu Linkun argued that, according to the testimony of the witnesses, the defendant did not threaten with a firearm, which clearly shows that the defendant did not commit a crime. Moreover, according to Zhang Yimei's testimony in the police department, she also said that the defendant did not threaten with a firearm and was not prosecuted. He requested that the defendant be declared not guilty and that the plaintiff fabricated the facts to prosecute, intending to have the defendant subjected to criminal punishment. He requested permission for a counterclaim and that the defendant be convicted of false accusation. After lawyer Xiao added his opinion, the court ordered the closing of arguments and scheduled a date for sentencing.

### Thugs Attack and Stab Theater Employee

Lu Dalin, a 44-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 220 Baker Road, worked as an employee at a local opera theater near the Xiaocai Market on Seymour Road. At around 8:00 PM last night, more than a dozen thugs went to the theater to watch a free show. Lu Dalin went outside to stop them from entering. As a result, a verbal dispute occurred. Suddenly, the thugs pulled out sharp knives and stabbed Lu three times in the back, causing him to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the thugs dispersed. Afterwards, someone hired a car to send Lu to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries are serious and his life is in danger.

### Shanghai Telephone Company Reorganized

In Accordance with the China Trade Act; Old and New Shares Have the Same Value

The Shanghai Telephone Company yesterday notified its shareholders in the city that the company's board of directors, at a meeting in New York on October 2, 1939, had adopted a proposal to reorganize the company, that is, to transfer all its assets and liabilities to a new company organized under the United States "China Trade Act." It is said that the specific purpose of this regulation is to assist various American enterprises in China and provide them with

Certain Benefits

Which cannot be obtained in accordance with the registration regulations of any state in the United States. This regulation has recently been amended to remove certain obstacles to re-registration. Following this plan, another company has been established in accordance with the "China Trade Act," named "Shanghai Telephone Company" "(Registered in the United States)." The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Concession Council have also approved the transfer of the franchise granted to the company to the new company. Therefore, the proposed new company must exchange its shares for the old company's

Shares Exchange

Share for share, as the price for purchasing all the company's assets, and must assume all the old company's debts. The par value of the new company's shares is 10 Shanghai general currency units. Once the plan is completed, the new company will be the owner of all the old company's assets, assume all the old company's debts, and have the same number of shares as the old company, 1,151,420 shares with the same par value. After the old company returns its assets and Zhao Wu clears them, it will be dissolved. A special meeting of shareholders of the old company is scheduled to be held in

New York Convene

At that time, shareholders will be invited to consider authorizing the sale of all the company's property and the dissolution of the company. If the consent of the statutory majority of shareholders is obtained, shareholders will be notified to exchange their Shanghai Telephone Company shares for the same number of shares of "Shanghai Telephone Company (Registered in the United States)". The board of directors also set October 6, 1939 as the date for determining the company's shareholders at the special meeting and the date for voting rights, and notices and proxies were mailed to all shareholders yesterday. Given the current uncertain overseas postal period, the Shanghai office has found a way to collect proxies from shareholders residing in Shanghai on their behalf and send them to New York by airmail. Therefore, all shareholders must immediately seal the proxy after signing and witnessing it in the pre-printed envelope attached by the company and return it to the Shanghai office of the Shanghai Telephone Company.

### Fake "Consolidated Tax Bureau" Arbitrarily Establishes Affiliated Agencies

The "Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau" has long been dissatisfied with the tax administration corruption by the authorities in the occupied areas. Since the establishment of the various district branches, recently, regardless of local commercial conditions and tax revenue, they have arbitrarily established various sub-bureaus and inspection and verification offices, wantonly exploiting merchants and civilians. "Director" Shao Shijun felt deeply uneasy (there is talk of immediate handover). Recently, in order to cover up the eyes and ears of the outside world, he specially "instructed" the various district branches that no affiliated agencies may be established without approval, which is actually just a piece of paper.

### City Chamber of Commerce Introduces Commercial Maps

The City Chamber of Commerce wrote, having recently received a letter from the Welfare Company, stating that the company recently published the Shanghai Street and Business Directory (also known as a commercial map), with the aim of enabling the city's business community to easily understand the current industrial and commercial situation, as well as the location of roads and public places, in order to help develop its industry. The entire book contains 140 street maps and 53 building maps, all of which are based on actual surveys and detailed drawings, so its content is exceptionally accurate. An advertising index is attached to the beginning, arranged in order of the number of strokes of the first character, making it easy to check. The binding is exquisite and the price is still the original price of six national currency units per copy. This book is necessary for general industrial and commercial enterprises. We especially request your association to promote it. We especially wrote to the various industry associations to widely introduce and encourage purchase among their respective industries. The above was received by the association. The association found that the street directory is a pioneering work in this city, with complete collection and transfer of information to its members, is of utmost importance. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Qi, October 5.

### Letter

Dear Editor, Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, I have been working hard to save the country in my own position, focusing on running a school, and have never heard of foreign affairs. I also feel that empty talk and advocacy movements cannot save the country. Now I see a news item in your newspaper about the Committee for Promoting Integrity and Shame, and my name is listed in it, which is very alarming. I hereby send a letter to declare that I have not joined the organization. Please publish it in the Letters to the Editor column. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Wang Zhicheng, October 18.

Free Talk

### Running, Qin Lao

I happened to see an article by a scholar in an old magazine, saying that he looked down on rickshaw pullers very much, because as soon as they saw the police coming to interfere, they didn't know any reason to talk, they just ran away. The conclusion of the article was: The people only know how to run.

This is very true. When the people see themselves as bare-handed and not organized, when they see people holding weapons who can control their lives, they naturally only run away. What else is there to do besides running? Preparing to be slapped or go to jail means you can't run. But unfortunately, people all have the instinct for self-preservation, even rickshaw pullers would not be stupid enough to accept being beaten or going to jail. Reasoning is naturally the most beautiful move, but unfortunately rickshaw pullers are not scholars, and their ability to reason is not very good. Even if they were good, the other party might not be willing to listen. As a result, there is really no other way but to run.

The people only know how to run. Who dares to say this is wrong? When they are caught, they run. When they are suppressed, they run. When they are bombed, they run even more. Looking at the major events in history, if you only focus on the people running, then it is almost a "history of running": At first, when the soldiers chased, everyone ran into the mountains; later, when the place became bigger, everyone ran to the seaside. Sometimes people in the city run to the countryside, and sometimes people in the countryside run to the city. Now that there are concessions, tens of thousands of refugees run to the concessions.

Scholars naturally look down on these. Because scholars first know how to reason, and secondly, even if they don't reason, they don't need to run. In history, we have seen a lot: when a new master arrives, scholars first offer articles and strategies, or wait for "imperial inquiries" and "recommendations", living very comfortably. Now, there's no need to say it.

However, the scholar's observation of the people is not necessarily correct. He only sees the bare-handed people who are not organized, and does not see the people who also have weapons in their hands and have become a team. At that time, the people will not only know how to run. They only know how to charge.

The running of the people is what we often see; the charging of the people is what we rarely see. But it is easy to see; as long as you force them to run, when they can no longer run, they will charge at you together. At that time, the scholars will probably be so scared that they will run away.

Looking at history, only focusing on the running of the people is naturally a "history of running". But in reality, every new era is charged out by the people. After charging, great men come out, and then the people start to only know how to run. Naturally, at this time, the scholars will come back. Then he goes to the street again to see the rickshaw pullers who don't know how to reason and only know how to run, expressing his contempt.

### Debate Tang Wei

—Jie Hui Shi Ji—

Cheng is a famous debater in the Qianniu Fang. Soon after his arrival, he started another fierce debate.

Old Xiao put down his pipa, his thin lips pursed tightly, his not-so-bright eyes staring maliciously at him. Shi Yu was also listening to Cheng's speech calmly. …Except for Lao Chong, everyone else was like soldiers on the front line, their minds closely connected to their ears.

“This time, regarding the debate about 'Chang Xiang Si' (Note), although Gong Lei's attitude was good, I think Lao Hei failed in the 'Chapter Style' and 'Section System'!” He looked around and added, "Both 'Dream of the Red Chamber' and 'Water Margin' are in Chapter Style. Can you say that their value is lower than Jiang Guangci's works?"

"You can't compare it that way. You should know that the era is not a fixed toy. My article 'Whether Chapter Style Still Belongs to the Scope of Contemporary Novels' also mentioned this issue!"

Today, Old Xiao's demeanor was amiable, and he kept wetting his lips with saliva.

"Then, do you think the value of art has time limits?"

"Of course, there are time limits!" Shi Yu and Lao Xiao replied.

"I don't agree. As long as it's a successful work of art, it has its artistic value at any time."

"There is some truth in that!"

Rong Qiu took a deep breath, and his goldfish eyes suddenly turned a corner behind his glasses.

"Nonsense... You should know that the so-called artistic value has already had compositional differences between this era and that era!"

"You don't understand, you are not qualified to debate."

"The issue is going further and further!" Lao Chong interjected, "In short, a successful work not only has artistry but also social significance! Zheng Xiaoxu's founding declaration has such beautiful writing, but I believe it will never have value at any time!"

He tied a long braid on his head with a red silk scarf, causing laughter throughout the hall.

Although the topic had changed, Old Xiao was still unhappy. After a few minutes, he threw his hat on his head, grabbed his lover's arm, and walked away.

Note: "Chang Xiang Si" is a chapter-style novel written by Gong Lei, a reporter for the Harbin International Association Daily (that is, Gong Gan, a reporter for the Tianjin Mungus Daily). It caused a fierce pen war due to Shu Qun's criticism.

Heading to the Battlefield of National Liberation (This Issue) by Sha Qing

### Hometown Lou Lan

A story I know is actually a true story.

It is said that there was a wanderer who drifted from place to place like a mendicant monk, his long days woven into an endless journey.

Perhaps due to the exhaustion of the long journey, or feeling weary, one day, he suddenly fell ill in a thatched inn. The morning light was hazy, and the rooster crowed at dawn, but he could not continue on his way as usual. What kind of world did the countless nights of dreams bring? Perhaps he picked up something in his dream? After that, he put away his ambition, returned to his hometown, and lived a peaceful life in seclusion.

"The Hu horse leans on the north wind, and the Yue bird faces the south branch," and people inevitably have thoughts of their hometown. Even if he has wandered the world for half his life, like the protagonist in this short story.

When you sit quietly in a chair or stroll in the garden, a common thing catches your attention. You stare at it, and you are transported far away; no matter what, you can't pull back the feet of imagination, and the courtyard and pavilions of your hometown appear before your eyes.

The magic of the hometown lures the hearts of wanderers. Can you forget the scent of your home?

The familiar song "On the Songhua River" lingers in my ears. It pulls my imagination to the distant other side. There once was a nest that warmed me there! The fledgling swallows fly south, and the old home has been destroyed. But how can the deep sorrow of home be dispelled?

I remember my hometown. "Although there are old dreams, I am unwilling to relive them." Indeed, it is a strong and down-to-earth state of mind; however, if nostalgia does not become sentimentality, it can also become a force to support the battle.

The flames of war have spread across the fields, and iron hooves gallop across the land. Friend, where is the pure land? Is your hometown safe?

### Lullaby Liu You

Night

The wise Apollo also gives mankind a tune, making them feel gentle and serene lullabies.

Lullabies are great for young children. Mothers need thousands of songs, this little one is the most important. When their children feel impatient and babble, only hearing the clear, gentle, and beautiful song can make them feel unboring and enter the dreamland.

After losing childhood, sleep is no longer as long as it used to be. People are attached to work, cherishing their careers, and often sacrifice necessary sleep time when they are nervous. Therefore, lullabies are rejected and cannot be included in adult songs.

In order not to waste their precious lives, people love the hard-earned time and are unwilling to waste it in sleep. They feel disgust and hatred when they hear lullabies.

Lullabies seem not to know this. They are used by other people, making them extraordinarily beautiful and containing incredible seduction, using them as a poisoned wine to anesthetize people in order to achieve those people's goals, so that they can oppress others and conquer others.

People moving forward, pay attention to this lullaby!

### Scavenger She Mang

Holding a cotton-padded black broken hook,

Strolling on the dark ring road;

Broken boots silently count the heavy footsteps,

The black bamboo basket behind him is towering.

Shaggy long hair breaks through the broken hat,

Angular lips squirm in the frustrating beard;

Revealing even more greedy eyes,

Eyes like the pupils of a black cat in the night.

Approaching the filthy bushes,

Flies swarmed over, sticking to the body,

Long trousers drag through the puddles of sewage,

Broken clothes are covered with decaying bone chips and soil stains.

Hands use the broken hook to turn over the layers of garbage residue,

Greedy eyes shoot out resentment,

Who can't see the flat and gorgeous street,

But wants to approach this foul-smelling stench.

Who doesn't have a home and hometown,

Who doesn't have the dearest loved ones;

However, everything is burned in the ghost's hands,

Only unforgettable hatred remains in the heart.

Ten thousand knots are tied in the wrinkled brows,

Ten thousand knots express ten thousand hearts.

Not afraid of passersby rolling their eyes and scolding, cursing and kicking,

Even more ignoring the pitying eyes that cover their noses and pass by,

Swallowing a bucket of sour tears,

Tears add hatred and strengthen footsteps.

From dusk to deep black,

The night does not allow the soul to rest in peace;

Risking the night's misery to pick up broken metal from the stench,

Tomorrow, when dawn comes, become a steel knife for revenge!

### Yu Qiaqing Marries His Granddaughter-in-Law

— Southern Tunes and Northern Melodies

——Grand Hall Performance Featuring All the Famous Shanghai Actors——

The 23rd of this month is the wedding day of Mr. Yu Jiqi, the grandson of Mr. Yu Qiaqing (Ji Yun is the eldest grandson of the Yu family, the son of Mr. Shun'en). The wedding will be held at the New Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, busy with national affairs, did not want to overspend and kept it a secret beforehand. Only yesterday did various parties receive his invitations. People in the entertainment industry, knowing that Mr. Yu Qiaqing has always been very kind to them, voluntarily initiated a performance to show their appreciation. Performers from all Shanghai stages will participate. The Tianchan Stage, Gong Stage, and Great Stage are all performing daytime shows due to their own evening commitments (the repertoire is still being decided). On the Golden Theater side, Song Dezhu will perform "Water Flooding Jinshan Temple" with fight scenes. The top star of the Carlton Theater, Zhou Xinfang, and the top star of the Gong Stage, Zhao Ruquan, will co-star in "Battle of Changsha," with Zhou as Huang Zhong and Zhao as Guan Gong. Yuan Shihai, the famous Golden Theater Jing actor from the north and south, is specially invited to play Wei Yan. The cooperation of famous actors from the north and south makes it a perfect match. On the Renewal side, Shan Wu Suqiu will perform Spinning Cotton. These are all confirmed programs.

The entire New Asia Hotel will be booked on that day. The daytime show will start at 2 pm and end at 8 pm. From 8 pm to 12 am, amateur performers will perform. After 12 am, famous actors from various stages will perform until dawn. However, all the performers are participating voluntarily. The costumes, supporting roles, and miscellaneous expenses are all paid for from their own pockets, without the host spending a single penny. This shows how well Mr. Yu Qiaqing usually treats people in the entertainment industry! Otherwise, such a grand hall performance would not be possible, no matter how much money others spend!

The cast will be Jin Yutang, a combination of the Wu Yuehua and Han Jinkui troupes. Jin Yutang is a newly created costume box, complete with all roles and brand-new costumes. Wu and Han are also doing it all voluntarily out of respect for Mr. Yu Qiaqing.

Shanghai has not seen a good hall performance for a long time, and this hall performance for Mr. Yu Qiaqing's happy event is not initiated by him but passively, all voluntarily initiated by people in the entertainment industry, which shows the greatness of Brother Ade even more.

### Isolated Island Drama Talk — Starting with the Battle of Puyang

— Wei Wei

Last week, I saw Wu Yanheng's "Battle of Puyang" at the Golden Theater. "Battle of Puyang" is a unique masterpiece of the Fu Liancheng Opera School. The protagonist, Lu Bu, was originally performed by Wu Xiaosheng. Among the students of Fu Liancheng, Ru Fulan was considered the best in this play. When Ru Fulan was at the school, he originally studied Wu Xiaosheng (he switched to Wu Sheng after graduation). Performing this play, paired with Han Fuxin's (who specialized in Wu Jing and has been in Tianjin for a long time, enjoying a good reputation in Tianjin) Dian Wei, was considered a difficult task. After Ru Fulan graduated, although he switched to Wu Sheng, he still performed "Battle of Puyang." Therefore, over time, the Lu Bu in this play became a dual role for Xiaosheng and Wusheng.

After Ru Fulan, there were two people in the Dang Liancheng Jiao class who performed this play: one was Wu Sheng Yang Shengchun, and the other was Xiaosheng Ye Shenglan.

Shengchun's play was his masterpiece, and he often performed it; Shenglan's play was no less than Shengchun's, but he did not perform it often. In recent years, both Shengchun and Shenglan have come to Shanghai and performed this play at the Golden Theater. However, Dian Wei and Cao Cao in this play occupy the same important position as Lu Bu. The performances of Shengchun and Shenglan in Shanghai either did not have a good Dian Wei or did not have a good Cao Cao (Yang Shengchun's Cao Huan was played by Liu Shengchang, and Ye Shenglan's Cao Duo was played by Zhang Qingcai from the Golden Theater troupe). Therefore, the performances were not very exciting due to the mismatched cast. Yesterday, I watched Wu Yanheng's performance, with Yuan Shihai as Cao Cao and Cheng Shaoyu as Dian Wei. Although Yanheng's performance cannot be compared with Ru Fulan's, it is above Yang and Ye, and the cast is well-matched, so the performance that day was even more exciting.

Yanheng has a voice and a good appearance. He is well-suited to play Lu Fengxian. Shihai's Cao Cao has the true inheritance of Hao Shouchun, which is beyond the reach of other actors. Although Cheng Shaoyu's Dian Wei is not yet proficient in his fight scenes with Yanheng, his facial makeup is beautiful and his appearance is burly, which is fitting for a great general. However, there was no fire on the stage, which reduced Shihai's body movements and made the plot worse. This is a real flaw. Yanheng rarely performs this play due to the supporting roles. In addition, plays such as "Cui Ping Mountain," "Qi Wu Mountain," and "Jia Family Mansion" have not yet been publicly performed.

### Dance Hall Sketches

— Xiao Tian (Forty-Six)

A Casual Talk About Two Dance Stars

In the Peking opera "Zhu Lian Zhai", the Second Wang Niang said to Li Keyong: "When you return in victory, there will be other benefits." Because Li Keyong was the King of the Shatuo Kingdom, he was honorable in status and rich in wealth, so she couldn't mention the word "reward" and had to say there were other benefits. For dance guests and dance hostesses, you could say they give a lot of money, but the actual word is "reward". And the dance hostesses of course only have "benefits" as a relative condition. Everybody be sure not to think about the dirty stuff. The benefits the Second Wang Niang gave Li Keyong, was just a table of wine, with her and her sister drinking together. As for the benefits the dance hostesses give the dance guests, they vary in light and heavy, big and small, with a thousand shapes and ten thousand forms, and can't be talked about in a single instance, and I can't write them all about for the moment, in short, they're "benefits".

The biggest benefit of the two dance stars I'm talking about in this piece, is that they don't take advantage of the guests, and don't treat them as suckers. Although their styles are different, their main ideas are the same. Who are they? One is Zhao Xuefang from the Paramount, one is Ru Aina from the Metropole. Ru Aina is delightful, her appearance is beautiful. She has a grandfather, a mother, and two foreign girls. She tells me about it with much joy. It is said that 2 years ago a guest wanted to enter a marriage alliance with her, and as the primary wife no less, but he wanted her to immediately drop out of the dance hostess life and go to school, study for 2 years, then have the wedding ceremony. As a result, the girl refused. Some people ask me, why do dance hostesses always love being dance hostesses? I say, it's because the well-fed don't know the suffering of the hungry. Try thinking about it, when she drops out of the dance hostess life, where will the household money for family living come from? Zhao Xuefang has bright eyes and a good smile, her deportment is graceful and dignified, she has an old mother, one younger brother, and one younger sister, and their maintenance, as well as the education expenses, all depend on what she earns with her 2 feet. When nobody is watching, her eyebrows are often frowning, with something of the appearance of Xi Shi holding her chest, like she has some kind of hidden worry. They won't swindle any money out of the guests, and they're even less daring to use an axe on them, so their business is pretty good. If the guests give them a fair return, they will also return to you a fair benefit. A friend said, "This isn't right, I've spent a lot of money on Zhao Xuefang, but I never got any benefit." I said, "Your thinking is wrong, she keeps you company while you have fun, keeps you company while you eat and drink, and talks and laughs with you, making you forget your sorrows, making you not feel lonely, is this not a benefit? As long as she's not taking advantage of you, and not swindling money out of you, then your money is well spent."

Finally, I must add a statement, it's not that other dance stars don't have this kind of benefit, and it's not that there are no good people besides Ru Aina and Zhao Xuefang, there are lots of good people in the dance hostess world. I just happened to discover it, and acting on the sacred mandate of hiding the bad and promoting the good, I'm praising them with a few words.

New Movie Introductions

### Until Tomorrow Comes (Part 1)

— Qi Hua

"When Tomorrow Comes"

After watching "Until Tomorrow Comes," it is as if reading a chapter of clear and beautiful poetry, which makes people yearn for it; however, under the cooperation of two excellent actors, Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer, and through the artistic skills of director John M. Stahl, "Until Tomorrow Comes" is also a poignant and sad love story. Is it not? In every quiet and beautiful picture, there is a tongue of fire full of youth.

From the moment Charles Boyer met Irene Dunne, more than half of the film is devoted to depicting the subtle romance between the French musical conductor and the American coffee shop waitress. Throughout this lengthy process, the director firmly grasps the development of their emotions; and gives full play to his strengths, using lyrical strokes, so that the audience can also yearn for the situation encountered by the male and female protagonists. In particular, the two scenes where Charles Boyer accompanies Irene Dunne back to his apartment and spends the night in the church are as exquisite and delicate as possible. For example, in the first scene: after Irene Dunne goes upstairs, she first comes into contact with the photo of Bai Baolan (Charles Boyer's wife), and unintentionally flips to a photo of a child; while Charles Boyer picks up the photo of his wife, accompanied by the sound of thunder, these are all detailed foreshadowing. And when Charles Boyer starts playing the piano, a tracking shot when Irene Dunne goes downstairs is truly filled with beautiful emotion. In the second scene: they take refuge in the church, using lightning to introduce the interior of the church; lighting candles upstairs: when Irene Dunne uses a book as a pillow, Charles Boyer holds her in his arms, until the next day when the repairman goes upstairs to inform them that the downstairs is flooded, all of which shows John M. Stahl's unique lyrical style.

### Anecdotes of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Silver and Gold Problem in the Ulong Courtyard Play

Chao Tianwang of Liangshan and the Luo brothers, because they were grateful to Third Master Song for saving their lives when they seized the birthday tribute, ordered Liu Tang to write a letter, risking great danger, to prepare to invite Song Jiang to the mountain as king, in order to express their sincerity in drinking water and remembering the source of gratitude; at the same time, they brought him a gold ingot as a small token of thanks or travel expenses. In fact, in terms of Song Jiang preserving their seven lives, of course, a gold ingot is still too thin, but with such a gesture of inviting him to the mountain as king, even if the gift Liu Tang hurriedly brought with him was meager, it would not be unreasonable. Moreover, they did not fundamentally believe that a mere gold ingot was enough to express their gratitude, it was just to bring Third Brother Song some travel expenses. However, given Chao Gai's position as the king of Liangshan, since he specially ordered Liu Tang to bring some money to Song Jiang, then a silver ingot would be impossible to present. Moreover, Third Master Song was also a good friend with extensive social connections and generous with money. For the sake of Yan Poxi, he casually spent three hundred taels of silver to buy her home, and then built a Wulong Courtyard, the silver used was also not a small amount. If Liu Tang handed over a silver ingot that was only at most fifty taels after handing over the letter in the restaurant, I think Third Master Song, who had spent money and seen money, would definitely not look at him straight in the eye, and would repeatedly thank him and refuse to accept it. Furthermore, the weight of gold and silver is very different, so the size of the silver ingot is also very different; to say that it was a silver ingot weighing fifty taels, I am afraid that it would not be convenient to put in the Zhao Wen bag, and at the same time, Yan Poxi's delicate jade hands could not casually pick it up with two fingers and casually stuff it into her arms.
