### Halifax Assures Ambassador Quo: British Government Still Willing to Continue Aiding China; Claims Tokyo Agreement Does Not Violate Nine-Power Treaty; Hull Reiterates U.S. Far East Policy Unchanged

(London) Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon to inquire about information regarding British-Japanese negotiations and investigate the truth of the situation. Ambassador Quo lodged a protest, opposing any possible concessions by Britain in North China that would harm Chinese interests. (Reuter, 24th)

(London) According to sources revealed today, Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi had a lengthy meeting with Foreign Secretary Halifax last night. Halifax reiterated the assurances made in Parliament, stating that the British-Japanese negotiations do not include any changes in British policy toward China or a rejection of possible aid to China. (Reuter, 25th)

(London) Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon and immediately expressed dissatisfaction that the preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan violated the Nine-Power Treaty. He strongly urged the Foreign Secretary to demonstrate the agreement's true intentions by continuing to provide loans and credit to China. It is noted that the Chinese government has long expressed dissatisfaction with the delayed payment of millions of pounds in British credit to China. (Havas, 24th)

(London) Yesterday, the British government provided the Chinese authorities with a firm assurance, stating that the Arita-Craigie agreement did not tacitly approve of Japanese troops being stationed in China, nor did it indicate that Britain had changed its Far East policy. This assurance was given by Foreign Secretary Halifax to Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi. Quo had previously requested clarification from the British side regarding the Tokyo Agreement, pointing out that the agreement clearly violated the Nine-Power Treaty and other League of Nations resolutions. Halifax replied that the British side had acknowledged in the Tokyo Agreement that Japanese troops were already stationed in China, but avoided stating that the British side endorsed the Japanese acts of aggression. All provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty and League of Nations resolutions remained unchanged by the new agreement. In the new agreement, Britain did not recognize Japan's belligerent rights. Halifax admitted last night that the issue of Chinese currency would be mentioned in the forthcoming talks, but Britain insisted that the Chinese legal tender issue could not be resolved without the consent of the United States and other relevant countries. According to a British government spokesperson, the Japanese side had originally intended to request that Britain cease providing loans to China, but after Craigie's strong contention, the Japanese side no longer insisted. Therefore, it is generally believed that Britain's new loan of three million pounds to China will soon be finalized. (Associated Press, 25th)

(Washington) Observers here today generally anticipate that Britain will not change its current policy in the Far East. According to State Department officials, even if Japan hopes to sign an agreement identical to the one negotiated between Britain and Japan, the United States has no intention of doing so. (Reuter, 25th)

(Washington) When Secretary of State Hull hosted reporters today, he was asked for his opinion on Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement. He replied that he had already explained the U.S. stance on June 19th and asked the reporters to refer to it. He added that since then, the situation in the Far East had not changed, and the United States had no reason to change its policy. (Note: Secretary of State Hull had stated that the incidents that led to the Tianjin Incident were not the concern of the U.S. government, but "their development and significance, as judged by what has been heard and seen in other parts of China, are extremely broad in scope, and the United States is indeed concerned.") In addition, he had received reports on various recent incidents in China involving Americans. He was watching these disputes with great interest and concern, such as the incident in which Becker, a clerk on the U.S. warship "Guam," was beaten by a Japanese sentry in Hankou. Rear Admiral Yarnell, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, had submitted a report to the Navy Department, stating that the Japanese soldiers were entirely responsible for the incident. (Havas, 24th)

### Chinese Government Authorities Maintain Cautious Stance; Anti-British Sentiment Grows Among Chongqing Residents

(Chongqing) The Chinese authorities are currently maintaining a cautious attitude toward the rumored agreement reached at the British-Japanese conference in Tokyo. The younger, more extreme factions are displaying impatience. This faction criticized, saying that if Japan can engage in anti-British movements, why can't China? They also stated that if Britain refuses to aid China and compromises with Japan, hoping to sacrifice China to protect its interests, then we must warn Britain that if China is destroyed, there will be little left for Britain to protect. This faction accuses Britain of betraying China, saying that when British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr recently visited Chongqing, the Chinese government, to show China's sincerity in cooperating with Britain and France, ordered a cessation of all anti-Japanese activities in the concessions. But look at the current situation in the foreign concessions; anti-Chinese activities have increased. If the situation becomes dire, the Chinese can all withdraw from the concessions and simultaneously begin to take countermeasures, surprising the owners of the concessions and forcing them to reconsider their attitude. (Reuter, 25th)

(Chongqing) Chinese individuals, although previously eager to know the content of the original British-Japanese compromise, are now carefully studying it. Generally speaking, however, they do not overemphasize it, believing that regardless of the wording of the compromise, the fact remains that Britain has compromised with Japan. President Chiang had already discussed China's attitude yesterday morning before the British-Japanese communique was released, indicating that Britain had made concessions. Anti-British sentiment among the Chinese is visibly growing everywhere in Chongqing. The following criticism can summarize the rest: It says that if Chamberlain's explanation is merely about savage force and violence, then we will follow suit in the future. The more prudent elements advocate that from now on, China must completely disregard the possibility of foreign aid and fight the war on its own. (Reuter, 25th)

(Chongqing) The Chinese side here believes that the preliminary Tokyo agreement between Britain and Japan is better than they had anticipated. However, most Chinese are unwilling to discuss future issues, as it remains uncertain whether this agreement can be implemented as Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons. The most satisfying point for the Chinese in the preliminary agreement is that the British side did not offer a promise of strict neutrality, nor did it recognize the existence of a state of war, and did not suspend currency aid and loans to China, allowing for the possibility of not closing the滇緬 (Dianmian) Burma Road. As for whether the so-called "Japanese-controlled areas" include the concessions of various countries in China, this is a question. If it includes the concessions of various countries in China, then all Chinese patriotic activities in the concessions will come to an end, pro-China newspapers may all be forced to close, and Chinese bankers and merchants will also suffer considerable disadvantages. However, concessions may not be interpreted as Japanese military control areas. Some Chinese officials believe that if a European war breaks out, the British can use this agreement with Japan to satisfy Japanese demands, thereby securing its interests in China. If a European war does not occur, then Britain can refuse Japan's various demands by citing the lack of such provisions in the preliminary agreement and threaten Japan with financial aid to China to force it to comply. However, all sectors of the Chinese community recognize that the preliminary agreement has not resolved any disputes between Britain and Japan, so there will inevitably be many conflicts in interpretation and implementation in the future. (Associated Press, 25th)

### Japanese Cabinet Meeting Discusses New Policy Towards China

(Tokyo) This morning's Cabinet meeting discussed the Nomonhan Incident, the situation in China, and the decline of the 法幣 (fabi) Chinese currency. Army Minister Itagaki reported on the new conflicts on the Manchurian border. Finance Minister Ishiwata, after stating the reasons for the decline in the value of the fabi Chinese currency, said that the biggest reason for the decline of fabi was the lack of support from the exchange equalization fund. (Reuter, 25th)

(Tokyo) Finance Minister Ishiwata today predicted that if the current situation continues unchanged, the value of the Chinese fabi will continue to fall, and advocated determining an independent monetary policy to deal with the inevitable decline in the fabi's value. Cabinet members then freely exchanged opinions on the war in China. It is heard that Army Minister Itagaki was unwilling to express his opinion, while Interior Minister Kido advocated determining a new plan based on the "new situation" in China and the implementation of Japan's firm intentions to resolve the China Incident. (Reuter, 25th)

### British-Japanese Compromise Plan Unanimously Supported by British Newspapers; Continued Support for Chinese Currency; Japanese Aggressive Propaganda Should Not Be Lightly Believed

(London) The Times' diplomatic correspondent commented on the British-Japanese plan today, saying that many foreign observers in London last night believed that the second thought on the British-Japanese compromise was not bad. Britain has not abandoned anything in its plan, but rather reorganized the existing situation and provided a basis for future living conditions. This plan certainly does not suggest that Britain has already bound itself in advance and must comply with any demands that the Japanese commander in China may raise. (Reuter, 25th)

(London) Several newspapers today endorsed the Japanese interpretation of the British-Japanese compromise, and many newspapers strongly advocated that Britain should continue to aid the Chinese fabi currency. The "News Chronicle" stated that there is now fear that the Soviet Union and the United States may recognize the Japanese view of the British-Japanese talks as more feasible, because actions speak louder than empty words. Therefore, the British government should seek to lend a large sum of money to China to demonstrate that its words are not false. This is a special way for the British government to express its recognition of China's major war in the East. Recognizing past facts is more important than safeguarding British rights in "this concession or that" concession. Action should now be used as evidence. The "Manchester Guardian" said that, from a generous point of view, the British government is now deliberately accepting a vague plan in the hope that the Tianjin dispute will be resolved soon. If Japan intends to recognize that this compromise will be applied to all of China, equal to the British guaranteeing cooperation with the Japanese conquest, if such an interpretation is entirely wrong, then the best way to quickly remove the damage caused in China, the United States, and Britain. What we should declare is that our aid to the Chinese fabi today is no less important than before. We cannot restrict the export of any materials that we can supply to China to help it continue its resistance. Our aim is to maintain the neutrality of the concessions, which may be justified, but in the broader struggle between China and Japan, cold-blooded neutrality is neither possible nor desirable for us. The "Daily Mail" said that Craigie did well in a very difficult job, and he has safely passed the first difficult hurdle in the British-Japanese negotiations. Now Japanese newspapers have reported eleven demands that hinder Britain's position in China, but Chamberlain has clearly stated in the House of Commons that the talks will be strictly limited to local issues. Britain should not take any action that would hinder the Chinese currency system. There are two kinds of arguments from the Japanese side, the more extreme ones we should ignore, and the milder ones seem to be more authoritative. (Reuter, 15th)

(London) The "Daily Telegraph" stated today that Tokyo has boasted of a great victory for the new order in East Asia, and German newspapers have spread rumors of British capitulation. These are all unfortunate and unavoidable examples of a new diplomatic tactic of covering up calm negotiations with shouting. Although people are inevitably worried that the rumors of British capitulation may be true, there is no reason to worry in the official documents or Chamberlain's brief remarks. Japanese military politicians seem to have hoped that Arita would include proposals to abolish the circulation of fabi, recall the ambassador to China, stop supplies passing through Burma, and recognize the puppet government in the Tianjin incident negotiations. However, judging from Chamberlain's statement that future discussions will be limited to local issues in Tianjin, it seems that the above proposals, even if they were made, have been withdrawn and may not be revived. There are currently no new features in the military situation in the Far East, and the Japanese army's recent attitude towards the British certainly does not require a complete change in British policy. Resolving the Tianjin dispute is not only what the British government wants, but also what the Japanese government needs. For the sake of continuing talks, there is an agreement to make Britain clearly recognize the Japanese invasion, but this recognition inherently contains the realization of China's resistance as an important component. (Reuter, 25th)

### Eastern Newspaper Praises Diplomatic Success

(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers today all congratulated Foreign Minister Arita on his diplomatic success and praised Britain for showing statesmanship in Tokyo. (Reuter, 25th)

(Tokyo) Navy Minister Yonai, referring to the talks between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, warned the nation not to think that as a result of the talks, Britain has completely changed its Far East policy. It is said that now we must pay attention to Britain's attitude towards various issues, including monetary issues. (Reuter, 25th)

### Chinese Currency Stability Issue British Labour Party MP Draws Government's Attention

(London) At the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, opposition Labour MP Bellenger drew the government's attention to the further decline in the exchange rate of Chinese currency and asked whether the Chinese exchange equalization fund had indeed been exhausted. Finance Minister Simon immediately replied, "The status of the Chinese currency and the accounts of the equalization fund must be kept secret, which is no different from the need to keep the same accounts secret in our country or any other country. The distinguished member will certainly understand this. I issued a statement on July 11, and nothing more or less." (Havas, 25th)

(London) The Financial News recently stated that the China Association convened yesterday to consider whether to ask the British government to replenish the Chinese currency equalization fund, believing that the original fund is now running out. The meeting did not reach a decision on policy and adjourned to study Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks on the Tokyo talks. (Reuter, 25th)

### British Aid to China Association Speaks Out Righteously

(London) The Aid to China Committee issued an article today stating that the British-Japanese plan announced by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons is simply an undeniable betrayal of China, which is bravely resisting to defend its national independence and territorial integrity. The terms and obligations of the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations' notice to member states to provide material assistance to China, not to take actions that could weaken China's resistance, and not to recognize situations created by force must be followed. Only by fulfilling these obligations can Britain maintain its dignity and avoid being an accomplice in acts of aggression. (Reuter, 25th)

One of the War-Torn Areas of Guangdong Province

### Japanese Aircraft Attacked Chongqing the Night Before Last; French Embassy Almost Affected; Bombs Mostly Fell in Suburbs with Little Damage; Various Locations in Jiangxi Province Bombed Separately

(Chongqing) Twenty-seven Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing last night, encountering intense anti-aircraft fire and engaging in fierce battles with Chinese fighter planes. The main areas attacked were in the western suburbs of the city and the area north of the Jialing River. Several bombs fell near the French Embassy, the closest being only a hundred yards away. A large fire broke out near the Jialing River, with intense flames illuminating the riverbank. Several bombs fell into the river. The Reuters temporary office in the western suburbs was almost destroyed, as three bombs landed within twenty yards of it, fortunately without exploding. One fell on the tennis court, and the other two fell in a narrow alley leading to the house of a foreign news agency correspondent. The walls of the house shook and collapsed, but the correspondent was unharmed. (Reuter, 25th)

(Chongqing) Last night, twenty-seven Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing. Most of the bombs fell in the suburbs, causing little damage. There was only one fire, located on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Items from the German Consulate in Chongqing have been moved to the new German Embassy to avoid air raids. Several bombs fell near the German News Agency. A German-owned house was slightly damaged when a bomb exploded twenty-five yards away. When the Japanese aircraft came to bomb, several Chinese aircraft took off to engage. The fighters took off quickly and drove away the Japanese bombers before the Chinese anti-aircraft guns could unleash their power. (Haitong News Agency, 25th)

(Ji'an) Thirty-five Japanese aircraft, in batches, attacked Jiangxi on the 24th. The first batch of two aircraft flew to Xingan and Xiajiang at around 8 a.m., wreaking havoc and dropping three bombs in each county. The second batch of six aircraft invaded Fengcheng at around 6 a.m., dropping eleven bombs inside and outside the city. The third batch of six aircraft invaded Xiushui at around 9 a.m., circling and observing for a long time before leaving. The fourth batch of thirteen aircraft passed through Wuning and Xiushui, harassing Hunan. The fifth batch of two aircraft invaded Zhangshu at 4:40 p.m., dropping six bombs inside and outside the city. The sixth batch of six aircraft attacked Zhangshu again at 5 p.m., dropping more than twenty bombs blindly before fleeing north. The city had alarms twice. (24th dispatch)

(Fuzhou) At around 1 p.m. today, three Japanese aircraft flew over Changmen and dropped eight bombs, then invaded the airspace of Fuzhou City, strafing along the river with machine guns before escaping half an hour later. Three Japanese aircraft were also spotted in Gaoshan, Fuqing, at around 3 p.m. (24th dispatch)

(Chongqing) When twenty-seven Japanese aircraft bombed here last night, the staff of the French Embassy and the foreign press corps nearly suffered an undeserved disaster. The Japanese aircraft dropped about sixty bombs, one of which hit fifty yards from the French Embassy, and two others landed in the new hotel where the cadres of the Associated Press, Havas, and Reuters were stationed. The residence of German national Genmuro has been destroyed. (Associated Press, 25th)

(Chongqing) An alarm was issued here at 6:30 p.m. last night, at which time Japanese aircraft had already flown over the border of Sichuan Province, heading towards Hechuan, as if intending to go elsewhere besides Chongqing. But halfway, they suddenly turned to the northwest of Chongqing and flew straight to Chongqing, arriving over the city at 7:30 p.m., dropping bombs on the north bank of the Jialing River, and then turning southeast to bomb the western suburbs of Chongqing. (Reuter, 25th)

### British-Japanese Four-Person Committee Begins Discussing Tianjin Case; Proceeding in an Atmosphere of Compromise; Japanese Foreign Minister Hosts Banquet for Representatives

(Tokyo) It is heard that the committee composed of British representatives Beckett and Herbert and Japanese representatives Tanaka and Ota is discussing the issue of security and maintaining peace and order in the British concession in Tianjin today. There were no records of the discussions, but in a moderate atmosphere and in accordance with the compromise on the general issues of the background of the Tianjin situation reached between Craigie and Arita, opinions were freely exchanged. It is heard that they discussed: (1) suppressing and jointly investigating those who generally violate the law; (2) suppressing and generally searching anti-Japanese and communist elements; (3) establishing a British-Japanese liaison office to maintain peace and order. It is expected that the committee will submit a report to the plenary session of British and Japanese representatives this afternoon or tomorrow morning. According to well-informed Japanese sources, if Britain and Japan reach an agreement on this issue, other issues in the Tianjin situation, including economic difficulties, can be easily resolved. After this morning's meeting, all British and Japanese representatives attended a luncheon at the residence of the Japanese Foreign Minister.

At 6:05 p.m. today, the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following communiqué on the meeting of the British-Japanese roundtable committee today: "The four-person committee assigned to review certain details of the Tianjin situation met at the Foreign Minister's residence this morning and adjourned at 5:45 p.m. All representatives will meet at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow."

Editorial

### Preliminary Anglo-Japanese Agreement

Our newspaper already discussed in general terms the rumored concessions made by Great Britain to Japan the day before yesterday. Yesterday, London and Tokyo simultaneously announced the preliminary agreement concluded by the United Kingdom and Japan at the Tokyo Conference. Let us now examine it:

The content of the agreement was published in yesterday's newspaper. For the convenience of the reporter's writing, it is reproduced again below:

"The British Government fully recognizes the actual situation in China where large-scale hostilities are currently underway, and recognizes that, given the continued existence of this state of affairs, the Japanese forces in China have special needs to ensure their own security and maintain public order in the areas under their control. The British Government will prevent or eliminate any actions or events that may hinder the Japanese forces or benefit the enemy. The British Government has no intention of assisting any actions that may hinder the Japanese forces from achieving the aforementioned objectives, and will take this opportunity to clearly inform British officials and expatriates in China that they should not engage in such behaviors or plans, in order to confirm the British policy in this matter."

There are unexpected points in reviewing this agreement, namely: (1) The word "neutrality" is absent from the agreement. For weeks, in Anglo-Japanese discussions, be it official or unofficial, or even from any other party involved, the issue of concessions and negotiations in Tokyo has invariably centered on the concept of neutrality. Our newspaper has also commented, "It is unreasonable and unauthorized for Britain to maintain neutrality in the Far East." The agreement does not mention neutrality. London newspapers, after the agreement was published, also used the argument that the agreement did not recognize Japan's belligerent rights as a way to justify the situation, which is also based on the agreement's silence on neutrality. We will not elaborate on this point today. What is essential to know is that this is a diplomatic maneuver, a sleight of hand, a tactic of substituting the pearl for the casket. Both the UK and Japan see avoiding the issue in this way as beneficial to their own interests. (2) The agreement does not mention British rights. The general principle of international agreements is reciprocity. Even in a dictated peace, the victorious nation grants the defeated nation some degree of leeway. However, this agreement is only a one-sided acknowledgment from Britain to Japan, a recognition upon recognition. The whole world must want to call this a standard written endorsement. The Tokyo talks were indeed suggested by Britain, and the British even expressed their good fortune that Japan accepted the suggestion. However, the preliminary achievement of the proposer is only "recognition upon recognition," while its own rights are not even mentioned by the other party. This is truly a miracle of British diplomacy!

Next, please analyze the contents of the agreement: The scope of what Britain "fully" recognizes is as follows:

(1) Regarding facts: Large-scale hostilities are taking place in China;

(2) Regarding time: The period during which large-scale hostilities continue to exist;

(3) Regarding the opponent: Japanese forces;

(4) Regarding purpose: The Japanese forces need to ensure their own security, need to maintain public order in the areas under their control, need to prevent or eliminate any actions or events that may hinder the Japanese forces, and need to prevent or eliminate any actions or events that may benefit the Chinese forces;

(5) Regarding passive obligations: The British government will not assist any actions that hinder the Japanese forces from achieving the aforementioned objectives;

(6) Regarding active obligations: The British government shall order British officials and expatriates in China to uphold this intention and act accordingly.

The reporter is confident in the faithfulness and accuracy of this analysis. We sincerely hope that British people and people around the world will compare this analysis with the full text of the agreement, and then cross-reference it with the statement made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the British House of Commons on the 24th, the day the agreement was announced, that "this negotiation is limited to the Tianjin local dispute." Is our analysis faithful? Is it accurate? The reporter humbly requests that Chamberlain remove his umbrella and show his true face to heaven.

Since this agreement is of a preliminary nature, it does not involve any specific issues. However, because there are no concrete problems, some members of the British Conservative Party still defend Chamberlain and deny that it is a failure! However, the scope is clear, the purpose is distinct, and Britain has "fully" acknowledged it in a written endorsement. Therefore, Japan and Germany and Italy are delighted with Britain's submission and Japan's success. However, the judgment of success or failure does not depend on concrete issues. Compared with the Nine-Power Treaty's provisions for the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and administration, based on the Japanese objectives that Britain fully recognizes, and the unilateral passive and active obligations that Britain bears, how can one recognize the conduct of large-scale hostilities? How can one recognize the actions of Japanese forces with this purpose? Compared with Britain's repeated resolutions to demand that Japan open the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, how can one recognize the military needs that Japan claims as its justification? And Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the military attache of the British Embassy in China, can greatly hinder the needs of the Japanese army and violate British obligations and deserve to die; this so-called need and obligation is what Britain fully recognizes. If he does not die, it depends on the Japanese army's permission to forgive the past and deal with him leniently. All of the above points, using today's agreement, to measure the unresolved issues between Britain and Japan in recent years, Japan succeeds and Britain fails, which is already clearly evident in this preliminary agreement, how can it still be denied!

As for developing this preliminary agreement into a second or third step, it depends on future step-by-step negotiations between the UK and Japan. It is not yet time for that, nor the matter, so there is no need to be rashly dogmatic. Certain types of problems and events will be based on the preliminary agreement and what form they will take in the future and what the outcome will be. However, based on the preliminary agreement, to make a general inference, if Britain makes any requests or protests to Japan, Japan can use military needs as an impenetrable shield. If Japan makes any demands or protests to Britain, Japan can use military needs as an impenetrable spear. Spears and shields are sharp weapons, and powerful countries can have them. However, Britain's sharp weapons, at least in diplomacy, have been disarmed against Japan by the preliminary agreement, and are now possessed exclusively by Japan.

Furthermore, step-by-step negotiations are a matter for both parties, and the power to accept or reject each point rests with oneself. Japan can make extravagant demands, but how difficult is it for Britain to refuse them sternly? If the preliminary agreement is like that, doesn't Britain have room to maneuver? Could it be that Britain has used up all of its iron to forge this great mistake? Yes, it is indeed possible; what constitutes a military necessity, what constitutes an obstructive action, all depends on how it is interpreted; Japan interprets it one way, Britain can interpret it another way, there is no definitive conclusion. Those with a sense of justice, who does not pity Britain and hope for it to recover, who would sympathize with Japan and advocate for it? If Britain can grasp the interpretation and reject what must be rejected, it would be welcomed by the world. However, is this to be expected? Judging from Britain's recent actions, it is not only a great defeat and mistake in diplomatic policy, but also a fundamental defeat and mistake in psychology and reason. In a small sense: when the Tianjin concession was blockaded, the British authorities comforted the parliamentarians by saying that British expatriates were fortunate that the milk supply had not been cut off, and so on, three or five times. While the Tokyo negotiations were underway, the British authorities begged Japan, saying, can the anti-Japanese movement not be suspended for a while? What is the meaning of this attitude! From a broader perspective: Britain always and everywhere regards facts as incorrigible, so it dares not clearly distinguish between right and wrong, and has absolutely no faith in justice. It always and everywhere calculates its own interests, and regards immediate and small gains as benefits, and immediate and small harms as harms, so it disregards the long-term and great future. It always and everywhere prides itself on its cleverness, but it is deceived by the most immature and most brutal. In the past, it was concerned about the Far East, but it prioritized appeasing the situation in Europe, so it compromised and sought complete accommodation, but the situation in Europe worsened daily. It appeased Germany with the Munich Agreement, but Germany was insatiable. It tried to alienate Germany and Italy, but Germany and Italy formed an alliance. Now, it makes concessions to Japan through the Tokyo talks, thinking that it can temporarily stabilize Japan and suppress Germany and Italy's囂張in Europe. This is a wonderful trick in diplomacy to defeat the aggressor groups one by one. It does not know that Japan and Germany and Italy, supporting and relying on each other, will continue their policies of aggression to the end and never separate. It does not know that concessions are not a way to limit aggression but actually help to promote aggression. It does not know that the movement or stillness, the civil or military, the alternating rise and fall, or the simultaneous actions of Tokyo, Berlin, and Rome are all aimed at defeating the anti-aggression front one by one! Germany and Italy not only rejoice for Japan, but also congratulate it, and they also rejoice and congratulate themselves. The public opinion in Britain and France points and laughs at Germany, Japan and Italy are worried, doubtful and cry for this. Is this not a great defeat and mistake in psychology and reason!

The above is a general review of the Anglo-Japanese preliminary agreement. As for the impact on the overall situation in the Far East and China's resistance against Japan, it will definitely not be very strong. The Anglo-Japanese negotiations and agreement are not enough to control China and the Far East. On the contrary, the future of the agreement, and the fate of China, and even the fate of Britain in the Far East, will be determined by China's resistance against Japan!

### Japanese Troops in the Yangtze River Basin Withdraw Several Divisions; Japanese Army's Western Attack Along the Pinghan Line Fails; Chinese Troops Recover Several Key Areas in Xinyang and Xihua; Japanese Troops on the Shantou Front Adopt a Defensive Posture

(Chongqing) According to a spokesperson for the Chinese army here, the Japanese army in the Yangtze River basin has suddenly withdrawn several divisions. One of the divisions was withdrawn from the area between Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake. Four divisions were withdrawn from the south bank of the Yangtze River, and three divisions were withdrawn from the north bank of the Yangtze River. Some of the withdrawn Japanese troops went along the Jinpu Railway, and some returned to their home country. Although the remaining Japanese troops are still guarding the transportation lines, the Chinese side has separately recovered Zaoyang, Tongbai, and Tanghe, west of Xinyang on the Pinghan Line. East of the Pinghan Line, Luoshan, Huangchuan, and Gushi in Henan have also been separately recovered by the Chinese army. According to the Chinese army spokesperson, the Japanese army's offensive has also been greatly hindered. In Shanxi, the Chinese army's strategy is to avoid frontal battles and attack its flanks and rear. (American Associated Press dispatch, 25th)

(Hong Kong) The Japanese army on the Shantou front has adopted a defensive posture. The Chinese army is preparing to recapture Chao'an. There are not many Japanese landing troops, and they are under pressure from the Chinese army and feel extremely threatened. According to reliable information, Chinese mechanized units have now moved to a certain stronghold west of Chao'an and Haifeng near Shanwei, preparing to meet the enemy. (Special dispatch, 25th)

(Yichang) The water level of the Hanshui River and the Dongjing River is still rising. The river embankment near Yuekou has breached again. North of Yuekou and Pengshi River, up to Tianmen, the water is more than ten feet deep. The Japanese army has suffered heavy losses. The Chinese army's troops crossing the Hanshui River to launch an attack are actively operating in the Wamiaoji area. A few days ago, the Chinese army encountered more than a thousand Japanese troops near Liujiaji and fought fiercely for a whole day. More than a hundred were killed by the Chinese side, and the Japanese army fled southeast. Furthermore, on the east bank of the Hanshui River, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people is extremely high. They have collaborated with the Chinese army to completely destroy more than ten miles of the highway west of Yanmenkou. The Japanese army's communication equipment has been greatly destroyed by the Chinese. (Dispatch, 24th)

Nanyang The Japanese army in Changtaiguan, Xinyang, advanced northward. Yesterday and today, they were attacked from three sides by powerful Chinese troops. The Japanese army could not withstand it and is currently engaged in fierce fighting near Minggang. (Dispatch, 24th)

Miluo The Japanese army in Yueyang and Linxiang, due to the recapture of Yunxi by the Chinese army and the interruption of communications, dispatched its main force in two routes to counterattack Yunxi on the evening of the 22nd. The Chinese army, which occupied the station and streets of the area, engaged in fierce fighting all night and began a flexible transfer to another location at 6 a.m. on the 20th with prisoners and spoils of war. (Dispatch, 24th)

Nanyang The Chinese troops attacking Xinyang routed the Japanese troops in Weiwang and Guowan, west of the city, on the evening of the 17th. On the night of the 18th, they launched a fierce attack on the North Gate and the railway station of Xinyang. The Chinese army bravely charged and immediately occupied the North Gate and the railway station. The Japanese soldiers in the city fiercely shelled the Chinese army. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the Chinese army voluntarily transferred. On the night of the 19th, they launched another fierce attack and destroyed the Japanese military warehouse. The Japanese side suffered heavy losses. (Dispatch, 25th)

Zhaoqing In recent days, Japanese warships have once again concentrated on the waters belonging to Zhongshan County, seemingly plotting something. It is estimated that on the 24th, one Japanese gunboat, two armored fishing boats, and more than ten motorboats arrived. On the 25th, one Japanese transport ship and armored fishing boat each, and four motorboats arrived. Two Japanese shallow-water submarines arrived from Sanzao Island. The Chinese coastal defense troops have been closely monitoring. (Dispatch, 25th)

Zhaoqing The battle situation in Jiangmen and Xinhui is quiet. The Chinese and Japanese armies are still in a stalemate. (Dispatch, 25th)

### Japanese Plan to Blockade Shameen

(Hong Kong) The Japanese authorities in South China today plan to blockade Shameen (Guangzhou Foreign Concession). The Japanese Navy announced that, from today onwards, all foreign ships are prohibited from sailing on the Pearl River. The announcement stated that the Pearl River is closed "for about two weeks because there are military operations in the Pearl River area." The blockade does not affect the current operations of foreign warships. The announcement also stated that Japan intends to blockade Shameen and inspect Chinese and foreign people leaving Shameen.

### Soviet Newspaper Reviews Sino-Japanese War Situation

(Moscow) A major newspaper in this city wrote an article reviewing the Sino-Japanese war, saying, "In the first half of July, the Chinese side took the initiative on the central China front. The fierce battles in various provinces of North China prove that the Japanese claim that the guerrillas have collapsed is completely unfounded. According to the Japanese themselves, in the past six months, in the Shanghai area alone, the Japanese army and the guerrillas have fought 39 times, and the Japanese army has been defeated each time. The Japanese army is now launching a large-scale offensive in the southeastern part of Shanxi and the adjacent areas of Hebei and Henan provinces, attempting to encircle the regular Chinese army and guerrillas there. The Japanese army participating in the offensive has 120,000 men, with powerful technical equipment. This action has so far been unsuccessful. In many cities and towns, the two sides have repeatedly entered and exited in recent times, with no definite outcome. And in the first half of July, in fifteen days, the Japanese army has suffered 17,000 casualties. The recent war situation further proves the high combat effectiveness of the Chinese army, which is sufficient to resist the Japanese army resolutely." (TASS dispatch, 24th)

### Sakhalin Island Dispute: Soviet Union Firmly Rejects Japanese Protest; Accuses Japanese Government of Protecting Illegal Activities; Loan for the China Eastern Railway Not Yet Repaid

(Moscow) Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Vydanyevsky, invited Japanese Ambassador Togo to meet today. He personally handed the Japanese Ambassador a reply from the Foreign Affairs Committee to the memorandum submitted by Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Nishi, on April 27 of this year.

The Japanese memorandum raised various issues regarding the conduct of Japanese businesses holding oil and coal mining concession rights in Northern Sakhalin. These businesses have consistently violated contractual obligations, even failing to pay rent and violating Soviet laws. The Japanese government has defended their actions and protested against the so-called errors made by Soviet agencies.

The Foreign Affairs Committee's reply resolutely rejects this protest, pointing out that the Japanese government's intention is purely to defend the illegal activities of the concession rights holders at any cost, even though these businesses have violated the contract and Soviet laws. The reply lists all the facts of violations of the contract and laws. It is stated that these businesses have systematically violated labor safety and fire prevention regulations, failing to comply with the repeated advice of Soviet labor inspectors and state fire agencies to take appropriate steps to reduce fire hazards and address deficiencies in labor safety equipment. The inspection of 244 facilities between 1938 and 1939 revealed 457 violations of labor safety and fire prevention laws. Due to poor fire prevention, multiple fires have occurred in the concession areas. For example, on November 2, 1935, two derricks in the Okha oil field were destroyed by fire due to electrical equipment defects. On November 21, 1937, a drilling rig was burned down. On July 19, 1938, an oil depot was completely burned down. The Soviet government cannot tolerate such violations of fire prevention laws, as the oil fields operated by the concession businesses are interspersed with Soviet state-owned oil fields. A fire in the concession area would endanger the lives of nearby Soviet oil fields and even local civilians. The concession agreement clearly stipulates the procedures for drilling, surveying, and mining in each field. However, the concession businesses have consistently evaded fully executing the necessary survey work, thereby violating Soviet mining laws. These technical regulations must be followed by anyone, and the Japanese concession businesses are no exception. These businesses have also violated the provisions of the contract and Soviet laws regarding the protection of labor safety. As a result, many accidents have occurred in the concession area. In 1937 alone, there were 96 accidents. The same is true in the coal mining concession area. Although its scope of work is very small, seven accidents have occurred in three months of 1939. The Japanese claim that Soviet agencies have obstructed the operation of the coal mining concession businesses has no basis whatsoever. The violator of the contract is not the Soviet agency but the Japanese business itself. They had almost completely ceased operations by 1937, thereby causing the Soviet government to lose a portion of the income that these businesses should have paid. On this point alone, the Soviet government has the right to cancel the concession rights before the expiration date based on the contract. The Nishi memorandum claimed that Soviet officials have exerted pressure on Japanese concession businesses. One example cited was that the Soviets ordered Japanese coal businesses to destroy the explosives stockpiled at the concession coal mine on February 15 of this year. In reality, the violator in this matter was also the Japanese business, because they did not comply with Soviet regulations for storing explosives. Since December 14, 1935, Japanese coal and oil concession businesses have not paid the rent due to the Soviet government, totaling 892,457.58 rubles to date. Since 1937, the oil concession businesses have also failed to fulfill their obligations for housing construction. Furthermore, according to the investigation by a special committee, the concession businesses, while requesting the import of goods and food from Japan, secretly stored enough goods and food to last six to seven months in existing warehouses for a certain special purpose. In the warehouses of these businesses, Berdan rifles, gunpowder, field telescopes, and other items prohibited from import into the Soviet Union were confiscated. There were also five sets of equipment for distilling alcohol and several barrels of raw materials. At the same time, the committee also found that the concession businesses had imported rice from Japan to supply illegal distilleries and sold goods to people unrelated to the concession area, and privately smuggled inferior goods and food to sell to workers. Despite accumulating a large quantity of goods and food, the concession businesses reduced the rations of essential foods such as meat, milk, onions, rice, and sugar to workers by 20% to 25% twice, in December 1938 and January 1939. The concession contract stipulates that the concession businesses may employ Japanese middle and lower-level workers, but not more than 25% of the total. However, in practice, these businesses have repeatedly used various tricks to violate this provision. As a result, by August 1938, 43.6% of the workers in the concession area were Japanese. Although Soviet agencies, in accordance with the contract, provided sufficient workers for these businesses to employ, they intentionally evaded and instead hired workers from Japan. For example, in 1937, at the request of the oil concession businesses, the Soviets recruited 1,700 Soviet workers and sent them to Vladivostok. However, the Japanese businesses delayed hiring them for 64 days. The same event occurred in 1938. When using Japanese naval tankers to transport oil through Japan, they also violated Soviet regulations canceling foreign warship berthing and crew landing. The Soviet government has repeatedly protested to the Japanese government about the overbearing behavior of the captains of Japanese warships.

All of the above facts prove that Japanese concession businesses have systematically violated the concession contract, recklessly hoping to create conditions for economic activities in Soviet territory similar to those in Manchuria, which is currently forcibly occupied by the Japanese. The absurdity of this attempt has been fully demonstrated by the Foreign Affairs Committee. In short, the Soviet government will resolutely stop all actions that violate the contract and Soviet laws. Japan has recently spread rumors claiming that the Soviet Union intends to cancel Japan's concession rights in Northern Sakhalin. This is a completely malicious rumor. The Soviet government, as in the past, will continue to faithfully abide by the concession contract and other treaties, without any difference. If the Japanese businesses also faithfully fulfill the conditions of the contract, their businesses can develop. In conclusion, the People's Commissariat rejects all declarations by the Japanese government acting as a defender of the illegal activities of Japanese concession businesses, because they are completely unfounded.

The Japanese government has also shown dishonesty regarding other issues. For example, the Japanese business Matsui Shipyard contracted to build three ships for the Soviet Union in 1936, receiving a deposit of 1,647,650 yen. However, by 1938, not only did they not deliver the completed ships to the Soviet Union, but they also refused to compensate for the losses according to the contract, and even refused to return the deposit. The Japanese government actually defended them.

The Japanese government has also blatantly violated its solemn obligations by refusing to pay the final installment of 5,981,625 yen for the purchase of the China Eastern Railway in March 1938, and has not paid a penny to this day. Although the Japanese government has violated its own obligations and instructed its citizens to do the same, the Soviet government and Soviet economic agencies have consistently abided by their obligations and will not deviate from this principle in the future. The People's Commissariat, while rejecting Japan's unfounded protests, also warns the Japanese government and Japanese concession rights holders, declaring that while the Soviet government abides by its obligations, it will resolutely demand that the Japanese side strictly abide by the laws within Soviet territory.

### Soviet Navy Day: Naval Chief Warns Japan: The Soviet-Mongolian Border is Inviolable; Pacific Fleet Exceeds One Hundred Vessels; More Submarines than Germany and Japan Combined

(Moscow) Soviet Naval Commissar Kuznetsov, in a speech today to 20,000 representatives of public organizations on Soviet Navy Day, warned Japan regarding the Mongolian-Manchurian border conflict, stating that the best guarantee against any danger of armed attacks against the Soviet Union is the ever-growing strength of the Soviet land, sea, and air forces. We know that some frivolous neighbors, such as those in the Far East, now require a lesson in our military might before they realize that our border is inviolable and that we will not allow anyone to infringe upon it. The Soviet Union's naval power is now rapidly increasing, and the shipbuilding industry has reached the stage where it can build all sizes of modern warships for a major naval power. We are currently building destroyers, flagships of destroyer fleets, and cruisers, and are preparing to build dreadnoughts of the Stalin class. The Baltic Fleet has been strengthened annually and will now be augmented with new surface and underwater vessels. The first Soviet warships appeared in the Far East five or six years ago. Today, the number of warships and submarines in the Pacific Fleet exceeds one hundred, not counting smaller vessels such as minesweepers. In view of the frivolity of our neighbors, the Pacific Fleet must maintain special vigilance and is now fully prepared to defend the motherland. The Soviet Union has more submarines than any other country, far exceeding the combined number possessed by Germany and Japan. The Soviet state advocates peace and does not threaten any country, but if enemies force us to use force to defend our homeland, our navy will be the most aggressive, etc. (Reuters, 25th)

(Moscow) Today, the entire Soviet Union warmly celebrated Navy Day. All ocean and inland river fleets held review ceremonies and athletic meets. In the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Fleet), battleships, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and other vessels lined up for several kilometers, inspected by Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Tributs and members of the Leningrad Military District and the Baltic Fleet Military Council. After the review, military exercises followed, with participation from land forces, covered by amphibious tanks, warships, and marines. In the Black Sea, celebrations were held in Sevastopol, beginning with a group swim by several thousand sailors and commanders of the fleet. Commander-in-Chief Admiral Oktyabrsky and key officials of the Crimean Autonomous Republic then inspected multiple warships anchored in formation, followed by a public gathering. A large gathering was also held in Khabarovsk in the Far East, with over 50,000 participants. Simultaneously, a review of the Amur River Red Banner Flotilla was held on the Amur River. In the evening, ships anchored along the riverbank in front of Khabarovsk and conducted tactical exercises. (TASS, 25th)

### Fighting Continues in the Nomonhan Area: Report from the Japanese Kwantung Army

(Tokyo) According to a communiqué released by the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Changchun at 11:35 AM yesterday, the Japanese-Manchukuo forces' counteroffensive against the Soviet-Mongolian allied forces across the Khalkhin Gol River is currently making "smooth progress." On July 11th, the Japanese-Manchukuo forces "repelled" the Soviet-Mongolian forces to a certain point beyond the border, after which they monitored their actions while dealing with the remnants of the Soviet-Mongolian forces in the Nomonhan area. However, the Soviet-Mongolian forces "consistently adopted a provocative attitude," establishing strong artillery positions on the west bank of the Khalkhin Gol River and reinforcing their tank and artillery units, waiting for an opportunity to cross the border again. They repeatedly attempted small-scale attacks on Japanese positions, but were ultimately repelled. On Saturday morning at 7 AM, approximately 2,000 Soviet-Mongolian troops, accompanied by about 100 tanks, crossed the border and launched an attack, whereupon the Japanese-Manchukuo forces initiated a general counteroffensive.

### British Opposition Party Member Questions Negotiations with Germany: Truth of Discussions Gradually Becoming Clear; Germany Also Denies Loan Discussions

(London) Labour MP Greenwood today asked Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons to comment on the statement by Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson to German economic expert Herr Wohlthat regarding a proposal to provide Germany with a loan. Chamberlain replied that there had been no discussion of a German loan. Greenwood then asked whether the cabinet was aware of such discussions or initiated them, and whether the government intended to begin discussions that resembled bribing Germany to buy peace. Chamberlain replied that none of the cabinet members, except the Overseas Trade Secretary, were aware of this conversation and that the government had no intention of initiating such discussions. One MP asked who was responsible for disclosing the conversation, to which Chamberlain replied that this was also what he wanted to find out. Labour's Will Thorne asked whether government officials could freely engage in conversations without prior government consent, and whether the government could solemnly confirm that no government official had spoken to Wohlthat. Chamberlain replied that he saw nothing particularly harmful in this conversation, as it was a private conversation between Hudson and a German official, and that any harm lay in the newspaper disclosure of the conversation. Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson attended the House of Commons as usual today and answered all questions. According to Reuters, there is no question of Hudson resigning. Foreign Secretary Halifax replied in the House of Lords that Wohlthat came to London as a delegate to the whaling conference and that discussing the refugee problem was also part of Wohlthat's mission, with nothing else involved. Wohlthat has visited London frequently in recent years and often met with British cabinet members concerned with commercial and economic issues between the two countries, as considering such matters is Wohlthat's inherent duty. It is therefore not surprising that the Overseas Trade Secretary met with Wohlthat and discussed matters of interest to both countries. The Foreign Office received a report from the Overseas Trade Department stating that the discussions had reached a stage where they could potentially improve foreign trade, but only if political issues were resolved first. The discussions focused on removing existing obstacles to the development of international trade, such as barter agreements, exchange restrictions, and import quotas. The economic issues then led to financial steps to eliminate these difficulties. The Overseas Trade Secretary stated that, in his personal opinion, if international trust were restored, there would be ample room for cooperation on financial issues. Based on this report, the widespread notion that Britain proposed providing Germany with a loan is untrue. (Reuters, 24th)

(Berlin) According to reports from London, Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson, in an address to London journalists, mentioned a British plan to lend a large sum of money to Germany, and that this proposal had been put to the German Ministry of Economics representative Herr Walter. A Havas reporter has learned that Germany has no intention of accepting the loan. Although Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson raised this proposal with Walter during his visit to London, it was purely a private exchange of views on economic matters and not a formal negotiation.

### Multiple British Aircraft Fly to France Three Times

(London) The Air Ministry has announced that today marks the 30th anniversary of the French aviator Blériot's flight across the English Channel. Britain will send multiple squadrons of bombers and fighters, totaling 240 aircraft, to fly over French airspace for the second time for training flights. The French side will also send multiple aircraft for intercept exercises. This is a new development in Anglo-French air force cooperation. Before departure, each British pilot received sealed instructions, to be opened only after take-off, detailing the flight routes for each squadron, including over Paris, Lyon, parts of the Pyrenees Mountains, parts of the Gulf of Lion, and the southern Bay of Biscay, covering a total distance of 1,300 to 1,500 kilometers.

### British-Polish Loan Temporarily Difficult to Establish

(London) During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon reported on the current state of financial negotiations between Britain and Poland, stating that the British government had proposed to the Polish delegation to guarantee a credit loan of £8 million to the country. However, regarding providing the country with actual funds, Britain and France have not been able to agree on the terms, and the British government may not be able to take the necessary legislative steps for approval before the House of Commons adjourns.

### British Press Tycoon Lord Kemsley Arrives in Berlin to Discuss Exchange of Articles Between Newspapers of Both Countries; Rumored to Take Opportunity to Meet with Hitler

(Berlin) British press tycoon Lord Kemsley arrived here today and is scheduled to travel to Beirut tomorrow to hold talks with Dietrich, head of the Information Department of the German Foreign Ministry. Local officials commented that Lord Kemsley's visit is at Dietrich's invitation to discuss the exchange of articles between British and German newspapers. Dietrich had made similar overtures to the press in Britain and America, but was not adopted by the American press. The British side expressed sympathy, so Lord Kemsley is making this trip so that Germany's views on current important issues can be published in British newspapers, and vice versa. Lord Kemsley has no other mission besides this. However, as Hitler is reportedly in Berchtesgaden, Lord Kemsley may take the opportunity to visit him. (Havas, 25th)

(London) British newspaper magnate Lord Kemsley, publisher of the Sunday Times, left tonight for Germany at the invitation of Dietrich, head of the Information Department of the German Foreign Ministry, to discuss Anglo-German press relations. However, according to well-informed sources in the Conservative Party, Lord Kemsley intends to visit Führer Hitler in Berchtesgaden on the 27th of this month, in a private capacity, to convey Prime Minister Chamberlain's views on the European situation to the Führer. Lord Kemsley met with Prime Minister Chamberlain several times at the end of last week and will undoubtedly have a full understanding of the Prime Minister's views. (Havas, 24th)

### Britain Sends Another High-Ranking Official to Moscow to Facilitate Mutual Assistance Agreement

(London) Well-informed sources in the Conservative Party stated that General Ironside, Inspector-General of Overseas Forces, is planning to travel to Moscow in the near future to participate in the Anglo-Franco-Soviet military conference. Regarding the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Chamberlain, in answering questions from members of parliament in the House of Commons today, was extremely circumspect, but the outcome of the negotiations is quite promising. Soviet sources here also stated that the main difficulty in the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union remains the definition of "indirect aggression," but it will not be difficult to resolve quickly, as all parties involved are willing to conclude an agreement as soon as possible so that staff talks between the three countries can be held immediately to formulate technical measures for the implementation of a future political agreement.

### Spain's Nation-Building Incomplete, Internal Strife Already Severe

(Paris) General Tellaño, the "Radio General" of the Spanish Nationalist Army, has been missing since being dismissed from his position as commander of the Second Military Region last week. According to reports from Saint-Jean-de-Luz, the general's attempt to cross the border was unsuccessful and he is currently imprisoned in Vitoria. Several Paris newspapers reported unconfirmed news that General Yagüe, commander of the Madrid garrison, had been arrested for refusing to cooperate with the Axis powers, and that several other generals had also reportedly been dismissed. The French newspaper "L'Ordre" stated that a major upheaval is brewing in Spain, while "Le Temps" stated that General Tellaño's downfall was due to the instigation of Interior Minister Suñer, Franco's brother-in-law, who is known for supporting the Axis powers, and that General Tellaño spoke imprudently during a speech in Seville. (Reuters, 25th)

Bayonne, France: It has been confirmed by officials that General Triaño, commander of the Second Military Region of Spain, has arrived in southern France after his dismissal. Furthermore, according to as-yet-unconfirmed reports from Spain, a car carrying General Triaño, flanked by a security team member on each side, was spotted in the Spanish city of Vitoria, with several other team members following behind in two separate vehicles, indicating that General Triaño has likely been arrested. (Havas, 24th)

(Paris) According to British newspapers, General Yagüe and several other prominent figures in Spain have also reportedly been arrested. While newspapers here are taking a reserved attitude towards the conflicting reports from various sources, they believe that a serious rift has developed between the restorationists and the fascists in Spain. According to reliable sources cited by "Le Temps," General Tellaño is still residing in Burgos. (Havas, 25th)

Gibraltar: According to unofficial sources, General Franco has detained the Seville rebels, and all means of transportation connected to Seville have been completely destroyed. Nationalist troops stationed on the roads have surrounded the city, and the situation is quite serious. According to visitors from Tangier, the situation there is extremely serious, and a strong anti-Franco movement is brewing. There are also rumors that clashes are constantly occurring between the Spanish Falange and the Nationalist Army. (Associated Press, 25th)

Burgos, Spain: General Triaño, commander of the Second Military Region, who was dismissed from his post, is staying at a hotel here. This morning, he met with Foreign Minister Jordana for twenty minutes, after which he quickly returned to the hotel. Neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor Foreign Minister Jordana were willing to disclose the content of the meeting. (Havas, 25th)

(Paris) Spanish Interior Minister Suñer denied reports in British newspapers of a major upheaval in Spanish domestic politics, saying that reports of General Tellaño fleeing to France and General Yagüe being arrested were also untrue. (Havas, 25th)

### German Naval Exercises in the Baltic Sea Focus on Submarine Training

(Berlin) Well-informed sources here stated that the German Navy is currently conducting large-scale exercises in the Baltic Sea between Warnemünde and Swinemünde, closely monitored by Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. The main objective of these exercises is to train submarine crews to attack and destroy a transport fleet. Five submarine flotillas, totaling twenty-five vessels, are participating. The newspapers have devoted considerable space to this news, often claiming the invincibility of the German fleet. The local "Führer newspaper" stated that "these exercises demonstrate the power of our submarines, just as they did during the Great War. This is an effective and powerful factor in defending the homeland." The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" stated that "the people must know that our current submarine strength is sufficient to resist any enemy, and its terror is no less than it was during the Great War. Its equipment is very sophisticated and sufficient to handle any eventuality." (Havas, 25th)

### Germany's Population Increases by Over Ten Million

(Berlin) A census was conducted in Greater Germany this May, and according to published statistics, there are a total of 79,730,000 people. In addition, there are 6.8 million people in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. It is also stated that four-fifths of the Germanic people now reside within Germany. When the National Socialists first came to power, Germany had only 65 million people. (Reuters, 25th)

### Anti-British Movement Intensifies in North China

(Beijing) The Japanese authorities are constantly intensifying the anti-British movement in North China. The Shinminkai has ordered its North China branches to intensify the spread of this movement by using propaganda and theatrical performances of anti-British dramas, as well as screening anti-British films. They are also widely using posters and drawings to urge a boycott of British goods. According to reports from Japanese sources in Jinan, the "Anti-British Committee" there has notified British business firms to withdraw from Jinan within fifteen days. (Reuters, 25th)

### Foreign Correspondents Praise the Effectiveness of China's New Strategy: Chinese and Japanese Forces Have Reached a State of Equilibrium; Chinese People Confident of Approaching Victory

(Chongqing) The soldiers and people in the Chinese interior feel confident that China's continued resistance will lead to victory. China has vast manpower and reserves, and the international situation is gradually becoming more favorable to China and less favorable to Japan. The extended front line has now reached a state of equilibrium with the Japanese army. The basis for "final victory will belong to China" lies in this. In the past six months, the Japanese side has made at least two gestures of peace, but Chiang Kai-shek has resolutely rejected them. Chinese soldiers are convinced that China is approaching the stage of victory and believe that if Japan cannot offer China acceptable terms, Japan will inevitably move towards defeat. However, from a foreign perspective, the longer China's resistance can be prolonged, the more favorable the peace terms it will obtain. China's strategy is extremely simple: it does not engage in decisive battles with the Japanese army. In other words, if the Japanese army launches a fierce attack on a certain point, the Chinese army on the front withdraws and attacks its flanks and rear. At the same time, the Chinese army's attacks are often multi-pronged, making it impossible for the Japanese to draw troops and concentrate them at one point. The Japanese army's inability to capture Changsha after occupying Nanchang is the result of this strategy. The terrain in the western provinces of China is extremely favorable to China. If the Japanese army can eliminate the Chinese guerrillas in Shanxi, it may be able to occupy Xi'an. If the Japanese army is determined to attack Beihai and Nanning, it may also be able to occupy them. At the same time, if the Japanese army is determined to open up the Canton-Hankou Railway, it may also be able to do so. It may also be possible to capture Guilin. However, the Japanese army's lines of communication will be further extended, which will allow the Chinese army's mobile strategy to be even more effective. As for the Japanese army's attempt to capture Chongqing, it is impossible under any circumstances. If the Japanese navy wants to sail up the river, even if the Chinese side offers no resistance, it would be "harder than ascending to heaven." If it takes the route through Hanzhong, it must engage in a long and arduous battle in terrain unfavorable to the Japanese. Even then, the chances of success are slim. At the very least, Japan must first defeat or eliminate China's main force before it has any hope of capturing Chongqing. But in fact, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese have never defeated China's main force. From now on, the Japanese army will have even less chance of defeating China's main force, because the Chinese strategy is not to engage the Japanese army in a decisive battle at any one point. At the same time, since the Nanyue Conference last November, one million troops have been sent to the occupied areas to engage in mobile warfare. More will continue to be sent in an endless stream to "turn the Japanese rear into the front," tying down Japanese troops and communication lines. The Chinese side believes that if this strategy is extended for a considerable period of time, it will inevitably cause the Japanese army to become weary of war, instill terror in the puppets, inspire patriotism in the farmers in the occupied areas, and cause Japan's financial resources to flow out endlessly, ultimately leading to Japan's economic collapse. Chinese economists believe that this economic collapse will likely become a reality within one or two years. According to Chinese estimates, the Japanese army's military expenses in China require 13 million yen per day. To date, Japan has issued 14,000,000,000 yen in public bonds and 2,850,000,000 yen in banknotes. Its gold reserves are nearing exhaustion. In terms of military strength, Japan also lacks sufficient allocation. On the one hand, it must defend against the Soviet Union, but the army that can be mobilized domestically is no more than seventeen divisions. The Chinese side believes that this is clear evidence that the Japanese military is approaching failure. This is the basis for the Chinese side's conviction of victory. The Chinese side also hopes for active international assistance, but the main focus is still on the Chinese side's strategy of attrition. Because it is a war of attrition, it will be a very long period. The Chinese side does not expect the war to end within one or two years. Their plan is to deal with Japan for at least four years, or even ten years, regardless of the years, forcing Japan to accept the Chinese conditions and resolve the Sino-Japanese War. (Associated Press correspondent, 24th)

(Kunming) An editorial in the Yishi Bao, a major newspaper in Kunming, today said that the current war is not only a war in the military sense, but also an economic war. Comparing the economic foundations of China and Japan, the newspaper concluded that China's economy is almost entirely based on agriculture, so the final victory of the economic war belongs to China. Some people are currently pessimistic because of the depreciation of the legal tender, but this is only one effect of the war and does not mean that China's economic foundation has been shaken. The newspaper also called for attention to the unreasonable price increases of domestic goods, saying that it should be remedied for the welfare of the Chinese people. (Reuters, 25th)

### Fierce Battles in Counteroffensive of Chao-Shan; Zhang Fakui Personally Supervises Battle; Wu Qiwai's Troops Capture Chao'an; Cheng-Hai County Town Unfortunatly Falls Again

Dian Dong Dispatch:  The battle in eastern Guangdong is in full swing.  Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth War Zone, was ordered to inspect the Dong River. In mid-July, he commanded Wu Qiwai's troops in a three-pronged counteroffensive against Chao-Shan, regaining Chao'an City on the eleventh night and achieving a great victory. Hua Zhenzhong launched a counteroffensive against Shantou from Sangpu, retaking Pengzhou and Tuopu City with the speed of a gale sweeping away fallen leaves. Yuepu, Anbu, Longwei, Meixitou, and the soldiers and civilians of Ouding in Chenghai joined forces. Shantou's periphery was entirely controlled by the Chinese army, whose main force

had entered Chao City.

The Japanese army stubbornly defended Jinshan Middle School, Hulu Mountain Huatuo Temple, Yingzhou Hotel on Shangdong Embankment, Zhugao Mountain Guanbu Temple, and Bijia Mountain Han Shrine, with only over a hundred soldiers at each location, fighting for three days and nights. Twenty-six anti-war officers and soldiers imprisoned by the Japanese army in the Chao'an County Government were released by the Chinese army. As the Japanese army was becoming isolated, Japanese aircraft quickly came to their aid, dropping packages of dry food and incendiary bombs, causing fires to break out everywhere inside and outside the city. The Japanese army in Shantou rushed to rescue in three routes. At noon on the seventeenth, more than six hundred Japanese cavalry soldiers first charged into the southwest gate from the Hu Di Road, Chao-Shan Railway. Over thirty electric-powered speedboats, fully loaded with artillery, landed on the dike on the north gate. When the Chinese soldiers and civilians saw the arrival of Japanese reinforcements, they retreated towards Anjie Road, Fengxi, and Guxiang. On the eighteenth, fierce fighting broke out

along both sides of the railway.

The Chao'an County Government was temporarily located in Meigang on Anjie Road. The newly appointed County Magistrate, Wu Lutai, officially took office on the eighteenth. Zou Hong, Commander of the Chao-Mei Garrison, personally supervised the oath-taking ceremony. Zhang Fakui deployed the counteroffensive military affairs in the Huang (Fengshun) and Tangkeng (Jieyang) areas. On the eighteenth, the Japanese army went south through the waterway to rescue Shantou. Three hundred people landed on the Beilong Embankment and attacked Cheng-Hai City. The Chinese army garrison in Ouding urgently withdrew to Waisha, and Cheng City fell again. This was the fourth time it had fallen. Hua Zhenzhong's troops continued to defend Anbu and Pengzhou Institute, waiting for an opportunity. At this time, the Japanese army in Chao-Shan was weak, and two thousand soldiers boarded ships to attack Haifeng and Shanwei again.

### Department of Education of Jiangsu Province Drafts Amendments to Regulations on the Establishment of Secondary Schools; Already Submitted to the Ministry of Education for Record and Implementation

Since the successive falls of Jiangnan and Jiangdu, Rugao, Jingjiang, Nantong, and other counties, public and private secondary schools established in these areas have been relocated, either to Shanghai or northern Jiangsu, or the main school was moved to Shanghai while establishing a branch in northern Jiangsu, or the main school was moved north while establishing a branch in Shanghai. Even secondary schools in Shanghai established branches in northern Jiangsu. In northern Jiangsu, some schools were even hastily established in the name of providing relief for students who had lost their schooling and employment, disregarding the registration regulations and the supervisory powers of the county education administrative organs. Some even applied for registration with the Jiangsu Department of Education despite having empty facilities and no assets or funds. Schools and branches that relocated to northern Jiangsu often indiscriminately admitted unqualified students, employed unqualified teachers, had inconsistent curricula, and were on the verge of bankruptcy. When Ma Yuanfang took office as the head of the Jiangsu Department of Education last winter, he was saddened and worried by this phenomenon and urgently sought ways to rectify it. He personally inspected Jiangnan while instructing the secretaries and section chiefs to conduct detailed research based on the findings of school inspectors and to draft appropriate rectification measures for his selection and implementation. Ma returned to the department in early last month and reviewed and approved the measures drafted by the sections and secretaries. The main points are as follows: (1) All branches established by provincial, county, and private secondary schools must be merged and no longer have the situation where the main school is in northern Jiangsu and the branch is in Shanghai, or the main school is in Shanghai and the branch is in northern Jiangsu. (2) Public or private secondary schools in Shanghai that relocate to northern Jiangsu must be entrusted by the Shanghai authorities and be subject to the supervision of the Jiangsu Department of Education and the local county education bureau (section). (3) The registration of newly established private secondary schools must meet the registration conditions with the approved flexible measures. (4) County private junior secondary schools may not recruit senior high school students and add senior high school departments without authorization. (5) All senior high school departments that should be banned under these measures will be allowed to transfer their existing senior high school students to provincial temporary senior high schools or registered private secondary school senior high school departments, but they must undergo strict qualification review and placement tests. It is reported that these measures were submitted to the Ministry and Provincial Governments for record and implementation in late last month. The complete relocation of the main campus of Yangzhou Middle School in Jiangsu Province to Shanghai is being handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of these measures.

### Trends in Secondary Education in Northern Jiangsu; Four Temporary Secondary Schools and Four Normal Schools to be Established

### Department of Education of Jiangsu Province Promoting Compulsory Education; Establishing 1,820 Compulsory Education Classes Within One Year Starting This August

This has been filed with the Provincial Government and the Ministry of Education. The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued an order to the county magistrates to strictly comply with this. The original order is recorded as follows: "The promotion of compulsory education is the most important and fundamental task during the war of resistance. The compulsory education classes to be added in each county in the 24th year should continue to be handled, and the Implementation Measures for the Promotion of Compulsory Education in the 28th year are hereby promulgated for you to instruct the county education bureau to strictly prepare in accordance with the standards for establishing compulsory education classes with reference to the actual situation in the area. The required expenses shall be drawn from the second reserve fund item in the county's local budget for this year, or from the surplus funds of the education fund, and a budget shall be prepared and submitted to the Department of Education for verification, along with a list of the number of classes to be established and the locations where they are to be set up.

### Worth Noting: Japanese Military Leaders Visit Europe. Terauchi, Osumi, and others passed through Shanghai yesterday to go to Germany. The inside story of this trip is to conclude a broad alliance. The new agreement is rumored to involve military understanding to jointly strike against Germany, Italy, and Japan.

Regarding the war clouds on the mainland, two of Japan's top military leaders, who are embarking on a journey to Berlin and Rome to hold historical military and political talks, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (24th) aboard the Kashima Maru. They will continue their journey to Europe today (25th). These two are former commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in North China and current military councilor Terauchi Hisaichi, and former Minister of the Navy and current military councilor Osumi Mineo. A large number of attendants are accompanying them. In addition, Isaka Takashi, one of Japan's leading industrialists and financiers, is also traveling with them. According to reliable information obtained by Continental News, Isaka and the president of the Japan Industrial Federation, along with other major industrialists, will sign a

Broad Commercial Agreement

with Germany in early October. These four Japanese leaders are ostensibly visiting Nuremberg, Germany at the invitation of Hitler to attend the National Socialist Party Congress on September 11. However, it is rumored that they are on a mission to conclude a broad alliance between Japan and its European allies. It is said that the Japanese ambassador to Germany, Oshima, has already obtained a preliminary understanding regarding a German-Japanese military agreement. However, Oshima's proposal was shelved by the army and moderates in Tokyo, fearing that this move would cause unnecessary and significant damage to Japan's foreign relations. However, the

European Situation

especially the start of the British-Soviet talks, as well as the strong pressure from the army's "radical elements", led Japan to change its attitude. As a result, it is said that a decision has been made to bring the informal talks in Berlin and Rome to a conclusion. The visit of these two military leaders to Berlin is not only the first time that Japan has sent a special envoy to Nuremberg to attend the congress, but also the fourth time in Japanese history that high-ranking military officers have been sent to Europe on a special mission. According to indirect news from Japan, Japanese newspapers greatly

Value

this visit to Fascist countries in Tokyo. Newspapers in Tokyo explicitly stated that this trip "will consolidate the Axis" and promote "mutual assistance between countries." News that the two financiers will sign a commercial agreement in Berlin is expected to increase German-Japanese trade as a result. Investigations reveal that negotiations for this agreement began eight months ago by the commercial counselor of the Japanese embassy in Germany. A preliminary agreement was reached in March, but negotiations

Stalled

due to the army's opposition to importing certain German goods. Now, the army seems to no longer oppose it. According to private news from Tokyo, most of the German goods imported by Japan will be military equipment, mainly cannons and airplanes. Currently, Japan is connected with Germany and Italy at least on the surface through the Anti-Comintern Pact and cultural agreements. The new agreement will link these three countries through far-reaching military and naval understandings. Yesterday morning, Terauchi and the other three representatives boarded the Izumo warship. The commander-in-chief of the Japanese forces stationed in Gonggu, Lieutenant General Oikawa, and the Japanese consulate and army and navy authorities in Shanghai also hosted banquets separately.

### Restrictions on Women and Children Leaving Ningbo and Hong Kong are Relaxed, but the Export of Young Men is Still Strictly Prohibited. Emphasis is placed on procedures, but there is no limit on the number of people.

After the Shanghai-Ningbo route was changed to load and unload passengers and cargo outside the Zhenhai estuary, it has been quite smooth. The German merchant Mou Fulun of the Lihe Foreign Company began his third voyage on the Ningbo line yesterday morning, leaving Zhenhai to return to Shanghai, arriving in Shanghai tonight. According to news from the Lihe shipping department, the ship is scheduled to continue sailing to Zhenhai the morning after tomorrow. Currently, the Ningbo defense department's restrictions on passenger entry and exit, except for the strict prohibition of young men leaving the country, have been relaxed compared to before. Therefore, for all ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, there will be no limit on the number of passengers traveling from Shanghai to Ningbo if the procedures are complete. The Haifu ship of the Lihe Foreign Company, which previously carried fellow villagers from Wenzhou to Shadi, stayed in Wenzhou waters for two days due to encountering a storm midway. It returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday morning. When the ship sailed to Shacheng, it carried a small amount of cargo. However, upon arriving in Shacheng, all passengers and cargo could not be loaded or unloaded due to obstruction by Japanese warships. Therefore, it has been transported back to Shanghai on the original ship. The plan for the ship to operate regularly on the Shacheng route has also been cancelled.

### The government is determined to maintain the legal tender in Shanghai with all its strength. The drastic changes in the foreign exchange market are being manipulated by speculators. Within the possible scope, it will still be maintained appropriately.

The Ministry of Finance has announced measures to prohibit the import of goods, measures for exporters to settle foreign exchange and receive exchange rate differences, and rules for applying for foreign exchange for imported goods, aiming to restrict the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods, encourage the export of major local products, and is determined to maintain the value of the legal tender with all its strength, and provide legal foreign exchange as much as possible. Regarding Shanghai in the occupied area, due to the government's inability to exercise power, speculators are manipulating and monopolizing the market, causing drastic changes in the black market for foreign exchange and gold, as well as improper operations such as exchange rate markups. Full preparations have now been made for the exercise of the legal tender in the occupied areas, and it will be firmly maintained. However, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai will still be maintained appropriately by the Stabilization Committee within the possible scope, and will be terminated if necessary, because it is detrimental to China's war of resistance. The situation in the Shanghai financial market is recorded as follows.

Foreign Exchange Trends Towards Stability, Speculative Arbitrage

After being maintained, the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai has stabilized. Yesterday morning, HSBC's listing was 4 shillings for the pound and 7.75 yuan for the US dollar, remaining the same as before, without any change. Although Japanese companies continued to push prices up, fortunately, due to Hong Kong's maintenance, the actual market rate was still relatively stable, with the pound at 4 shillings and 5 pence and the US dollar at 8.75 yuan. However, the arbitrage between forward and spot rates reached an astonishing level of adding one yesterday morning, that is, one yuan can be profited for every ten yuan. Those with strength are all engaged in this arbitrage speculation.

Securities Black Market Rises Across the Board

Because all parties confirmed that the principal and interest of the unified public bonds due at the end of July, although the Ministry of Finance declared that payments were suspended, the four banks of Zhongzhong, Jiaonong, etc. allowed discounts and borrowings, so the black market rebounded. At the close of trading yesterday morning, Type A unified bonds were 51.9 yuan, up 1.3 yuan; Type B was 43.3 yuan, up 1.15 yuan; Type C was 42 yuan, up 8.5 cents; Type D was 41 yuan, up 8 cents; and Type E was 41.55 yuan, up 7 cents.

Gold Gradually Levels Off, Markup Returns

After the gold black market meeting opened yesterday morning, prices still fluctuated drastically. The morning closing price was 3,570 yuan, down 30 yuan compared to the morning closing price the day before yesterday. The afternoon closing price was 3,670 yuan, up 120 yuan compared to the afternoon closing price the day before yesterday. The Hangpai of Yinlou Datongxing was 355 yuan in the morning and 370 yuan in the afternoon. As for the exchange rate markup, it was between 220 yuan and 230 yuan yesterday.

### Municipal Bank Deposits Begin to be Returned

Entrusted by the Shanghai Banks United Preparatory Association Bill Exchange Office, the Shanghai Municipal Bank and the Shanghai Industrial and Trust Company are acting as agents for the bank and company to return deposits, with as many as 3,300 households. Currently, most depositors have completed registration with the office, and payments have begun at the office since July 21. All deposit principal and interest are paid in legal tender, and the interest on various deposits is still generous, so depositors are not at a disadvantage. However, the board of directors and supervisors of the bank and company previously approved by the Ministry of Finance that all deposits above 300 yuan must be returned in installments in accordance with the measures to stabilize finance, and deposits below 300 yuan will be returned in one lump sum. Therefore, the office can only strictly verify the payments. However, according to staff at the office, the thousands of depositors in the Municipal Bank and Xingye Trust Company mostly have small savings deposits, so most of them can be paid in one lump sum.

### The Rickshaw Pullers Association Requests Rent Reduction

The "Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Association", organized by representatives of rickshaw pullers in various districts of the city, in order to oppose the illegal increase of rickshaw rent by rickshaw owners, and to request the implementation of a 30% rent reduction, as well as the abolition of the rickshaw puller registration "application form", specially sent four representatives yesterday morning at 9:00 am, carrying a petition, to the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors on Jiangxi Road, Sanma Road.

General He briefly delivered a few words after he read the order issued by President Roosevelt appointing him as commander of the Asiatic Fleet, and warmly shook hands with General Ya. General Ya then met with his successor. About half an hour later, General Ya had taken off his military uniform, put on a light yellow casual wear, and wore a light straw hat. He left his flagship for the last time, accompanied by his staff member Conner in casual clothes. When he entered the speedboat, the band played and the officers and soldiers cheered. General Ya is scheduled to take the President Coolidge wheel back to the United States on August 2."

### The Market Closed Early, the Rice Market Experienced Black Market Trading, The Market Was Chaotic and Hoarders Did Not Care, The Authorities Sent Personnel to the Scene to Give Earnest Explanations

Due to hoarders pushing up prices and people outside the industry speculating and manipulating the market, insisting on not selling the purchased goods, the transactions were chaotic. All grades of rice were uniformly raised to the current price, which was not in line with the principle of separate arrangements stipulated by the authorities in the concession. Top-grade and special-grade rice were nowhere to be found in the markets, and black market transactions occurred. However, those engaged in black market transactions were completely private, with no transaction receipts, aiming to avoid punishment by the authorities. At 9:00 am yesterday morning, the Fuzhou Road Rice Market of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association opened, and people were crowded and noisy. The whole market was filled with shouts of pushing up prices. The market price rose yesterday morning, and the number of transactions was only two or three tenths of the usual amount, almost having a market but no transactions, and the market was at a standstill. The management committee members took turns to persuade people, but the hoarders were calm and unmoved, causing the market to be forced to close early.

Retail Sales in Stores, Unified Price

According to a reporter from Dagangshe, the Shanghai Rice Dealers Association, in view of the fact that the transaction price of rice in the Shanghai rice market has exceeded the maximum limit, making it impossible to purchase, the price of rice sold retail in the rice stores is now the same as when it was purchased in the market. If the retail price is increased, it will affect people's food, and if it is too low, the cost will be a loss. Therefore, in order to take into account the livelihood of ordinary people, the association, in addition to reporting the current market situation to the concession authorities for correction as soon as possible, also unifies the retail price of rice in the stores of its members, distinguishing the quality of the rice, and includes military commissions, etc., in order to maintain business.

Concession Authorities Go to the Scene to Explain

Since the Public Concession Engineering Bureau stipulated the price limit for Guomi, the highest grade of white rice should not exceed 20 yuan, and the highest grade of Ke Xian should not exceed 16 yuan. In view of the soaring price of rice in the market, in addition to sending personnel to strictly investigate and allowing anyone to report the facts at any time for the purpose of taking action and prosecuting the matter, at 11:00 am yesterday, it sent personnel to the market to explain the meaning of the authorities' price limit to 105 firms and hoped that rice merchants would abide by it consistently.

Anhui Province Embargo, Jiangsu Smoothly Flows

The amount of rice arriving in Shanghai yesterday (1) There were more than ten ships coming down the river, (2) Five or six trains came, (3) More than 3,000 packages were loaded by ship, and the total was about 5,000 packages. However, the rice merchants from Wuhu were not allowed to issue removal certificates due to Japanese obstruction. Although the rice merchants repeatedly negotiated, it has not been resolved so far. Therefore, the rice shipped from Wuhu to Shanghai has disappeared. However, although the bottom line of Shanghai's entire people's food has slightly decreased, the season for new rice to enter the market is approaching, and there will be no panic of shortage.

### The Situation Suddenly Became Tense in the Counterattack of the Chinese Army on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line, the War in the Xichang Area Was Quite Fierce, and Highway Traffic Was Obstructed

Since the East Battlefield Military Authority actively equipped the guerrilla army along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Line, trained strong soldiers, eliminated the old and weak, and assisted the masses to thoroughly eliminate bandits, it has been very active in various counties and districts near the line, which has caused extreme unease to the Japanese side. Frequent mobilization has been carried out in recent days to strengthen the road protection force. The Japanese army in various county and city defenses has closed the city gates in the evening due to insufficient manpower.

Joint Counterattack on All Routes

The number of counterattacking troops in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, Taicang, Kunshan, and Qingpu is more than 40,000, led by Mei Guangdi, Zhu Shouhua, Ren Tianshi, Wang Shilai, etc. The Chinese army on all routes, currently commanded by Deng Muyin, the commander-in-chief of the Jiangsu guerrilla army, has begun a counterattack since the 23rd of this month. The war has been quite fierce, and the progress of the three counties of Xichang and Tai has been the fastest. The vanguard commando of the Chinese army has advanced to the surrounding area four or five miles away from the city to deploy defenses, and will make a plan to attack the city after responding to the rear troops. Slogans of the Chinese army have now been found inside and outside the city, and the Japanese puppet army is extremely panic-stricken.

Traffic Obstruction, Commercial Depression

After military operations occurred in various counties along the line, traffic suddenly became blocked. The traffic on the Shanghai-Xichang Highway, from Baimao Station in Changshu to Yangjian Station in Wuxi, and on the Qingkun Highway has been cut off from time to time. Automobile and transportation companies carrying goods have stopped one after another, and Japanese merchants have also shortened the distance of their passenger and freight cars, mostly changing to water transportation. Due to the serious situation in the interior, residents have moved away, and business is extremely depressed. All goods that have been ordered in Shanghai have been notified to postpone shipment.

### New Port of Northern Jiangsu Will Soon Be Recaptured

People from Northern Jiangsu said that in the past month, the guerrillas in Northern Jiangsu have been cooperating with the regular army to fight against the Japanese army, and the fighting has been exceptionally fierce everywhere, with victories in every battle. The Lianshui and Huai'an areas have been recaptured successively, all because General Li plans day and night and personally commands the front line in every battle, so the soldiers and generals are willing to work hard and have repeatedly made great achievements. Recently, in order to take the real to attack the unreal, they have turned to the area along the river. The Japanese army is weak and exceptionally panicked. The Chinese army has taken advantage of the victory to seize various port strongholds and is invincible. The new port has been occupied by the Japanese army for a long time. It is said that our army is now actively advancing.

### Methods for Exchanging Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan Local Currency Notes Now in Effect; Payment Made with Drafts from Original Locations or Chongqing; Other Foreign Currency Notes Still Accepted at Full Value

Following instructions from the head offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications regarding the exchange of local currency notes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan, the Shanghai branches of the two banks issued a notice yesterday to comply. Regardless of small or large amounts, all notes will be paid with immediate drafts from the original issuing location or Chongqing, and holders will be allowed to use the drafts to purchase local goods in the interior. However, notes from other regions will continue to be accepted as usual. Details are as follows:

Two Banks Issue Notice: Two Measures

After verification, the following measures have been approved: (1) All unredeemed notes with the names of China, Communications, Tianjin, Shandong, and Communications Bank Wuhan notes will be paid with immediate drafts payable in the original issuing location or Chongqing (without exchange fees). (2) To facilitate noteholders' purchase of local goods in the interior, we will also consider offering free remittance services to the interior." We will comply accordingly. This notice is issued on July 25th, the 28th year of the Republic of China."

Currency Notes from Other Locations: Accepted Universally

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications that the exchange of currency notes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan is handled by all branches and offices in Shanghai, in addition to the Shanghai branches of the two banks. However, this is limited to Tianjin and Shandong Province, including Jinan, Yantai, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Wuhan. As for currency notes from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other locations, they can still be used as usual and are not subject to the above two measures. All banks and financial institutions in Shanghai also fully accept and circulate currency notes from regions other than Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan.

Methods for Nanyang Bank Currency Notes

Currency notes issued by various commercial banks have been taken over by the Currency Issuance Reserve Management Committee: (1) The Central Bank has taken over the Zhongnan, China Agricultural and Industrial, and Siming banks. (2) The Bank of China has taken over the China General Chamber of Commerce and Agricultural and Commercial banks. (3) The Bank of Communications has taken over the Zhejiang Xingye, China Reclamation, and China Industrial banks. The currency notes of the above banks are still allowed to be used as usual. However, currency notes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan can also be exchanged at the three banks (China, Communications, and Central) that have taken over, with the same procedures.

Zhejiang Currency Notes: Accepted at Full Value

Currency notes issued by the Zhejiang Local Bank in Hangzhou should be accepted at full value as usual. Since the rejection of currency notes from North China, there has been a misunderstanding about the bank's currency notes, and they have also been rejected. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the Shanghai branch of the bank that, in order to maintain its credit, the bank has instructed its Shanghai branch to redeem the notes without limitation. Therefore, noteholders who wish to exchange for Shanghai currency notes can apply at the branch at 381 Jiangxi Road. Furthermore, the bank's currency notes are accepted by all banks and financial institutions in Shanghai.

Various Banks Accept for Remittance to the Interior

Various banks in Shanghai, such as Xinhua Bank, have accepted remittances in currency notes from North China and Wuhan. Businesses or individuals who wish to remit money to the interior can use currency notes from the above locations to remit to the interior. The same applies to purchasing local goods in the interior. In addition, it has been reported that some small financial institutions are taking the opportunity to accept currency notes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan, charging a discount of 5 cents to 20 cents per yuan. After collecting these notes, these small financial institutions then exchange them for remittance to the interior, aiming to profit.

Public Confidence Stabilized After Implementation

Yesterday morning, some people still went to the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications requesting to exchange currency notes from other locations. The two banks, in addition to handling Tianjin, Shandong, and Wuhan currency notes according to the two measures instructed by the head office, continued to exchange currency notes from other locations as usual. After explanations from the two banks, noteholders understood deeply and changed to remitting to the interior. As a result, the amount of remittances to the interior received by the China and Communications banks yesterday increased slightly compared to previous days. Preferential treatment was given by waiving remittance fees. After the morning, no noteholders requested exchange, proving that public confidence has stabilized.

### Regarding the Newspaper Attack Case: Japanese Sources Claim Attackers Were Supporters of Chongqing, but Fail to Provide Concrete Evidence

The China Press reports that regarding the shooting on Edinburgh Road (now Nanjing East Road) that resulted in four deaths and twenty injuries, a Japanese spokesperson made statements at a press conference yesterday (24th) that contradicted newspaper reports. According to the spokesperson, the Japanese authorities received information that the attackers were terrorists supporting Chongqing, attempting to create friction between the Shanghai Municipal Council (under British influence) and the Japanese authorities in order to hinder the smooth negotiations currently taking place in Tokyo. A reporter asked what the motive would be for terrorists supporting Chongqing to attack newspapers that enthusiastically support

the Chongqing Government.

The spokesperson replied that the matter is currently under investigation by the police. However, it has been said that the attacks on the two newspapers were the result of their recent reduction in anti-Japanese sentiment. A reporter pointed out that one of the attacked newspapers had received numerous threatening letters from a group claiming that if the newspaper did not change its attitude, its building would be destroyed. The attack occurred a few days after the newspaper published articles from the Chongqing authorities. Another reporter asked if the Japanese authorities considered

this matter serious.

The spokesperson replied that considering the widespread rumors that Chinese were planning to assassinate British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr in order to obstruct the successful conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo, this matter is serious. A reporter asked, if any evidence is obtained proving that the terrorists are related to a certain group, will the Japanese authorities cooperate with the police to arrest the perpetrators? The spokesperson replied that it is first necessary to have proof. As stated repeatedly, the Japanese military authorities are deeply concerned about maintaining

peace and order

in the concessions. If any individuals are found to be in conflict with the Japanese policy and their guilt is proven, the Japanese authorities will naturally cooperate in suppressing them. A reporter asked if the spokesperson had more concrete information regarding the claim that the terrorists were instructed by the Chinese government. The spokesperson replied, "Why don't you ask the police where they obtained their information?" Or ask if the terrorists in question are hiding in the demilitarized zone next to Edinburgh Road.

This fact,

do the Japanese authorities know it? The spokesperson replied that they did not know, and denied that the Public Concession authorities had discussed with the Japanese authorities the arrest of armed rioters hiding in the "Great Way" area. Or ask, did Japanese military police and the police hold a meeting the day after the armed rioters fired on a police search team on Edinburgh Road on July 2nd? The spokesperson replied that the Japanese authorities received a report of this meeting. A reporter asked if the seriousness of the shooting on Edinburgh Road was sufficient to allow the Japanese side to implement its policy of participating in maintaining peace and order in the Public Concession. The spokesperson replied that in this sense, the case is not serious. However, the details of the matter are not yet clear.

### Vigilance Line Near Chang Geng Li

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that special police guard teams and plainclothes personnel recently set up a vigilance line at the scene of the Edinburgh Road (i.e., near Chang Geng Li) shooting on Saturday and Sunday nights, due to a letter warning that riots may break out there again this afternoon (25th).

### Ministry of Economy Announces List of Prohibited Goods

The Ministry of Economy recently issued a notice to the provincial and municipal governments and chambers of commerce, stating that the goods in Article 2, Section 1, Item 2 of the Regulations on the Prohibition of Japanese Goods should be investigated and announced by the Ministry in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of the same article. The list of these goods, trademarks, etc., has been compiled and published as a category for prohibition. It has now been further verified that fifty companies in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other locations, including Mitsui & Co., Ltd., are all invested and operated by Japanese merchants, and the goods they produce should be announced as prohibited in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations on the Prohibition. In addition to listing the locations of the manufacturers to be prohibited, product trademarks, etc., and submitting them to the Executive Yuan for record, and issuing a ministry order to announce the prohibition, the Shanghai industry associations should inform their members that they must not purchase these goods. If there are any violations, they are allowed to report to the government for investigation.

### Earnest Handling of Draft Applications

After the Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee handled the issuance of drafts for interbank use, various banks and financial institutions provided property reserves to apply to the committee for issuance and circulation in the market. In order to prevent general hoarding of goods, which leads to soaring prices and affects people's livelihoods, the committee decided to handle the issuance of drafts for interbank use earnestly, depending on the asset and business conditions of each bank and financial institution. Regarding the allocation of a total of 50 million yuan in drafts, it is limited to the actual needs of each bank and financial institution. However, there is no designation of how much for the China, Communications, and Central banks, and how much for the commercial banks. However, it is tentatively assumed that 10 million yuan is for the financial industry. The financial industry association has sent letters to its member financial institutions, limiting them to report the required amount within two days. It is reported that 42 financial institutions have filled out forms, with the maximum being 500,000 yuan and the minimum being 200,000 yuan. As for the remittance preparation inspection committee jointly formed by the municipal chamber of commerce and other five organizations, it is about to convene a committee meeting to implement the inspection.

### Garbage Transported to Zhabei, Suddenly Detained; Shanghai Municipal Council, at the Request of the Japanese Side, Transported the Garbage to Fill Land; Detained by the Pseudo-Regime Under Direct Order; British Consul Demands Release of Detained Western Employees

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Works Department, at the request of the Japanese Marines, dispatched a large working team yesterday (24th), consisting of 28 trucks and one private car, carrying garbage from the Public Concession to Zhabei to fill low-lying land. Before dusk, they were suddenly detained under the order of "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an. The people were detained at the Jiangwan Police Station of the "Shanghai Special Municipality," including English supervisor Ross, German Bielutz, and a White Russian driver who rented a truck. The trucks were detained at Bazhi Bridge, and are still being detained this morning (25th). The whole

Background of the Incident

is that the "Special Municipality" demanded payment of fees. Personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Council, with the assistance of officers from the Japanese Marines, negotiated last night in order to release the people. It is reported that the filling of low-lying land with garbage from the Public Concession has been going on for many months. One of the low-lying areas, the one that crosses the railway line from Jiangwan and enters Hongkou Park, is one of them. The Shanghai Municipal Council used to pay the Shanghai Municipal Government 120,000 yuan annually, with a special permission to dump part of the garbage into the Huangpu River. Since the Municipal Government moved, the Shanghai Municipal Council has

Stopped Paying This Fee.

However, two weeks ago, Chuan made a request, not only demanding this fee, but also demanding the "arrears" for the past two years. Therefore, the Works Department stopped dumping garbage into the Huangpu River. Now, although Ross and others are working on behalf of the Japanese Marines, they are still being detained, which is a deliberate move by the "Special Municipality" to extort 240,000 yuan from the Shanghai Municipal Council. The detained vehicles include 12 trucks from the Works Department, 16 rented trucks, and one private car. The keys to start the engines of each vehicle were

Taken Away Yesterday.

British Consul Kitson protested to the Japanese Consul General today regarding the illegal detention of Ross, in order to ensure Ross's immediate release. It is reported that filling low-lying land with garbage is an extremely safe and hygienic measure. For the past fifteen years, the Shanghai Municipal Council has been doing this at the request of the landlords, otherwise the landlords would have to purchase sludge to fill the land. Recently, a large number of artificial hills in Zhao Feng Park were also built using this method. The Works Department uses

Garbage for Filling

and mixes it with sludge and a thick slurry made from dust from yarn factories. This slurry can prevent insects and their larvae from escaping. After being poured into low-lying areas, the heat under the slurry can not only kill insects and their larvae, but can truly eliminate past ills. Therefore, if one thinks that garbage is simply placed on the ground and attracts flies and insects, then one is completely mistaken.

### Postal Worker Subsidies

The Bureau Agrees to Provide Relief Funds

Recently, the price of goods has become expensive, and the impact on the lives of the general public is not insignificant. Even postal workers, who have always been known for their relatively good treatment, are feeling the pinch. Therefore, they submitted a request to the Postal Administration a month ago, which was forwarded to the Ministry of Communications for approval to allocate living allowance funds to help them. It is now heard that the Postal Administration has telegraphed Shanghai, but the amount has not been determined. It is reported that the Shanghai Postal Authority, sympathizing with the suffering of its employees, has agreed to temporarily issue temporary relief funds at the end of this month before the Postal Administration determines the amount to be issued, while awaiting instructions from the Postal Administration. All employees, although in this difficult situation, still maintain their long-standing firm belief, deeply understand the difficulties of the times, and can also understand the sincere efforts of the Shanghai Postal Authority. Various rumors are absolutely inaccurate.

### The Communication Office of the Employees of the Two Railways: Never Fails to Work

The Communication Office of the Employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways was established by representatives elected by all the evacuated employees of the two railways. It has been working for nearly two years and has achieved remarkable results. Previously, there were rumors that the office would be closed due to financial problems, and the employees were all afraid. In reality, the representatives in charge have consistently implemented the spirit of struggle and strived for the welfare of all evacuated employees. Currently, there are more than 5,000 employees trapped in the isolated island, and their lives are extremely painful and their situation is miserable. It is heard that Lin Kanghou and Yu Qiaqing have expressed deep sympathy for the plight of the evacuated employees of the two railways and the enthusiasm and facilities of the office in running around to seek help. They are now appealing for relief on their behalf.

### Brief News

The China Foreign Relief Society Resolves The China Foreign Relief Society held a board meeting yesterday at the Renji Road, chaired by Father Jacquinot de Besange, the Western President.

### Lawsuit Between Two Branches of Brothers Over the Estate of the Ancestral Righteous Estate; Continued Hearing Yesterday Adjourned

Cheng Zhonghan, Cheng Zhongjie, Cheng Zhongqi, Cheng Zhonggan, and Cheng Hongji, five brothers from Suzhou who are currently staying at the Wanyuan Hotel, jointly hired lawyers such as Huang Jiyuan to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court against their cousins Cheng Zeheng (a lawyer residing at 533 Avenue Haig), Cheng Huting (residing at 41 Avenue Foch), Cheng Yinwu, and Cheng Fuchen for jointly

Breach of Trust and Embezzlement

of more than 100,000 yuan of the common property of the Righteous Estate. According to the indictment, their ancestor, named Lan (Chongzhai Gong), established the Chengxun Righteous Estate during his lifetime to provide relief to the poor and support the clan. At that time, the amount of property set up was quite large, but since the first defendant took over, no notices were ever given to the clan members, and the contents, annual income and expenses, were never accounted for. Repeated requests to check the accounts were always

excused and delayed.

Only in 1935, after the plaintiffs requested to issue the surplus funds of the Righteous Estate of 150,000, was it distributed to each branch. As a result, only 30,000 yuan was received, and 120,000 yuan was withheld by the defendants and not delivered. Before 1935, when the mother of the first defendant, Wang, managed the estate, she withdrew 110,000 yuan without authorization to establish An Ding Middle School. This action was not approved by the clan members and not only violated the rules of the estate, but the school is still

operating in the occupied area,

and the accounts are never disclosed, which is even more obviously using the name of running a school to raise money and enrich oneself. The total amount of Righteous Estate funds embezzled is about 400,000. In addition, the interest from the Yanyi Gongxian two public fields managed by the defendants has always been issued monthly to support the lives of clan members. Now they have been repeatedly urged to no avail. According to the fixed amount, there are more than ten months, amounting to more than 3,000 yuan. A request is made to investigate according to the law. The case was heard once, but because the defendants did not arrive, the hearing was adjourned. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Kechou

Continued the Hearing.

Only Cheng Zeheng and Cheng Huting, two defendants, arrived in court. The plaintiffs and their lawyers arrived in court and stated the previous situation. According to the first defendant, Cheng Zeheng, he took over in 1935. Since August 13th, the Righteous Estate has had no income. The account book was handed over in January of this year. After the court inquired in detail, the hearing was adjourned to another date. The defendant was released on bail, and the defense lawyer was allowed to bail him out.

### Married Daughter Sues for Property Division; Claims Sister-in-Law and Nieces Embezzled

Zhou Fuguo, a local woman residing at 8, Lane 111, Avenue Road, near hired lawyer Zhang Deqin, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against her nephews Fu Zuxin (currently residing at 3, Mingde Village, Rue Kim), Fu Zufeng, Fu Zuyuan, and her sister-in-law Fu Houqin (the legal representative of the defendant), to

Divide the Estate.

It is said that the defendant Fu Zuxin's father, namely the husband of the defendant Fu Houqin, Xiangxian, and the plaintiff were siblings born to the same father. Because their father died early, all family affairs were first managed by their grandfather, Guiyuan Gong. After the grandfather passed away, all family affairs and estate were managed by Xiangxian. Unexpectedly, Xiangxian passed away on December 8, 1938, and the defendants

Illegally Embezzled

the property left by Guiyuan Gong and ignored the life of the plaintiff's mother, Tao. It is found that the estate should be inherited by the plaintiff and her late brother Xiangxian in equal halves, and should not be arbitrarily seized. Now, in addition to the fields and properties in the occupied area, which are temporarily difficult to manage, the share of 10,000 yuan in the Yuyuan Heng Foreign Goods Company and the share of 16,500 yuan in the Yongfeng Grain Company in the special area should not be further seized. Therefore, she requested to be granted

Half of the Estate,

18,250 yuan, etc. According to the indictment, the court was presided over by Judge Li at the Civil Division Seven Court yesterday. Neither party was present. The lawyer representing the plaintiff stated the previous situation. The lawyer representing the defendant then responded to each point. The court then stated that it was necessary to summon witnesses and adjourned the hearing to August 11.

### Arrested for Carrying Guns

At 7:30 yesterday morning, detectives from the French Police, while searching pedestrians at the intersection of Rue Cardinal Mercier and Avenue Road, noticed two men riding bicycles. Due to their hurried appearance, they stepped forward to search them. They found a pistol on each of the two men, so they returned to the police station to detain them for investigation. It is heard that they were planning to take action at a certain number on Rue Cardinal Mercier. The truth of the matter is still being investigated by the police.

### Gangster Sentenced for Extortion

Song Xigen, an unemployed gangster, invited his apprentice Wang Jinfa (i.e., Xiao Ma Pi) on the 11th of this month. That night, they carried back a small coffin from the wilderness. A threatening letter was glued to the coffin lid and placed at the entrance of the Juji Zhuangyuan Restaurant on Avenue Edward VII in an attempt to extort 50 yuan in national currency from the restaurant, but failed. They were arrested and sent to the Special First Court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang sentenced Song Xigen to one year and two months in prison for attempted extortion, and Wang Jinfa to six months in prison, to be sent to a reformatory.

### French Police Crack Down on Gambling Den; Arrest Three Criminals for Investigation

Pan Xuezhi, a Jingjiang native who trades in duck and chicken eggs, recently transported a large batch of duck and chicken eggs to Shanghai from his hometown for sale, receiving more than 6,000 yuan. This was learned by Tang Yiming (39 years old, from Nantong), Shi Jinquan (45 years old, from Nanjing), and Tian Zanliang (30 years old, from Zhenjiang), who specialize in gambling for a living. Taking the opportunity, they tricked Pan into gambling in a room at 2, Lane 10, Hongyu Fang, Zhengjia Bridge, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, on the pretext of asking about the route to Jiangbei. Xiao Zhang, a person from Anhui, claiming to be Young Master Ma, also entered the game. For the first ten or so rounds, Pan Xuezhi won. But by the eighteenth round, Pan was heavily in debt, losing more than 1,000 yuan. The French Police learned of this and dispatched detectives to arrest Tang and the other two, and seized more than ten bundles of legal tender in a small leather suitcase in the room. Only the top bill was genuine, and the rest were waste paper. There is no doubt that this was a planned fraud. The case was sent to the Criminal Division One of the Special Second Court yesterday. The police lawyer requested a postponement, stating that Xiao Zhang, an accomplice from Anhui, was at large and that the case still needed to be investigated. Judge Miao asked the three defendants briefly and announced that the hearing would be adjourned to August 3.

### Pharmacy Employee Forges Invoices, Embezzles Money, and Flees, but is Arrested

Shen Hexiang, a young man from Chaozhou, only 19 years old, was a salesman at Heji Pharmacy, Room 105, Qingyun Building. The pharmacy had dealings with Huamei Pharmacy at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road. Usually, after Heji sent goods to Huamei, the person in charge of Huamei would sign and stamp the invoice, and then Heji would take the invoice to the accounting room of Huamei to collect the payment. This was the usual practice. Recently, Shen became addicted to dancing, which led to insufficient income and heavy debts, which he could not make up for. So he recently forged an invoice from Heji for 1,403 yuan and 20 cents, and at the same time forged the signature of the person in charge of Huamei, and fraudulently obtained the money from the accounting room of Huamei, and then disappeared without a trace. After Huamei discovered this, they reported it to the General Police Department. After investigation by Detective Feng Qishan, Shen was arrested on the previous day in Room 204 of the Dachunghua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division One of the Special First Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a lawsuit according to Articles 210 and 339 of the Criminal Law. After interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, he announced that the hearing would be adjourned for one week.

### Enticing Women From Good Families To Prostitute; Zhang Changgui Sentenced to Six Months

Zhang Zhuqing, also known as Zhang Changgui, from Zhenjiang, opened a brothel at 5, Lane 35, Xinzha Road, forcing prostitutes to receive customers and taking profits from them. On October 10 of last year, when Zhang returned to his hometown, it happened that a woman named Wang was too poor to make a living. So, she mortgaged her 17-year-old daughter, Wang Xiuying, to Zhang, stating that the term was three years and the price was 180 yuan. At the same time, Zhang also tricked a 35-year-old woman, Wang Xiufeng, into coming to Shanghai and placed her in the brothel he opened, forcing her to live the life of a prostitute. From then on, both women fell into hell, suffering deeply, and all the money they earned was taken by Zhang. Wang Xiufeng found this kind of human hell unbearable, so she took the opportunity to escape and reported to the police. West Patrolman Fangte and Hua Sandao Tou No. 1013 went to investigate and found out the truth. On the previous day, they arrested Zhang Zhuqing and Wang Xiuying together and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division Two of the Special First Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang charged Zhang with the crime of disturbing public morals according to Article 231 of the Criminal Law and stated the facts of the case. He also presented the testimony of Wang Xiuying and Wang Xiufeng about being forced to receive customers. When questioned, Zhang's confession was evasive. Judge Chuan sentenced Zhang Zhuqing to six months' imprisonment for attempting to profit by enticing a woman from a good family to commit adultery. If he converted it to a fine, it would be calculated at one yuan per day. Wang Xiuying was temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for care, pending her mother's arrival to claim her.

### Jewish Refugee, Lauter, Employs Launch to Commit Suicide in River; Jewelery Business in Shanghai Suspected of Financial Difficulty

The French Shanghai Daily News on the 25th reported that a foreign gentleman, elegantly dressed, hired a launch at the Customs Wharf on the Bund yesterday at 3 pm, with a clear rental of four hours for 20 yuan, which was paid immediately. The captain of the launch then set off downstream of the Huangpu River. Initially, it was thought that he was an officer from a foreign warship. Unexpectedly, the foreigner suddenly jumped into the water in the middle of the river. Consequently, the captain of the launch took the foreigner's underwear left behind and reported to the police ashore. The police found a passport in the underwear, revealing the foreigner's name as Lauter (transliteration), a German refugee registered at the Shanghai Refugee Shelter as number 2386. His residence was located at 1376 Avenue Joffre. Furthermore, a business card from a Mr. Medison, residing at 1132 East Broadway Road, was also found in the clothing. The Public Concession police authorities, knowing that this person resided in the French Concession, transferred the case to the French police for investigation. The French police immediately sent detectives to Mr. Medison at Broadway to inquire, who revealed that the person who drowned himself was his brother-in-law. According to the French police's investigation, Lauter, who drowned himself, was in the jewelry and diamond business. Lauter's wife stated that her husband often claimed to have a lot of money, but she had never seen his bank deposit slips. After this incident, various German and Russian jewelry stores in this port have been buzzing with rumors. Last night, many people reported to the French police that they had sold goods to Lauter on credit, with significant values. One Russian even lent him 600 US dollars. It was also reported that Lauter had purchased a Ford car for 450 US dollars two months ago.

### Shanghai-Kunming Through Transport: First Batch of Goods Arrives in Saigon

Goods to be Loaded Tomorrow for Direct Transport to Kunming; Second Batch of Goods to be Shipped Soon

Maitong Customs Brokerage at 12 Yonganfang, Yongan Street, French Concession, and Jinyuan Customs Brokerage at 24 Yonganfang, have jointly launched the Shanghai-Kunming through transport service, which has officially commenced.

Yesterday, both firms received a telegram from Saigon stating that the first batch of through-transport goods had arrived in Saigon and will be loaded onto trains tomorrow (the 27th) for direct transport to Kunming for delivery. Therefore, Hakka merchants, upon hearing the news, expressed satisfaction and praised the two customs brokerages for their diligent work. It is now reported that the second batch of through-transport goods is scheduled to be shipped on the French Post Company's General Joffre, departing from Shanghai on August 1st for Saigon. Hakka merchants who have been entrusting goods in recent days have been flocking to the two firms to register for shipment. Therefore, the goods to be shipped this time are expected to be much more than the previous batch. As for the section from Saigon to Kunming, it is fully the responsibility of the Sino-French Express Company, with personnel assigned to take care of the goods along the way.

Science and Life

### Science and National Liberation

— Heshan

The Middle Ages in Europe were a dark period. At that time, tyrants, corrupt officials, warlords, and landlords ran rampant, preying on the people. The autocracy of religion was enough to make society lifeless and stagnant. Anyone who reads the history of medieval Europe knows that the people lived in dire straits, and their suffering was beyond human endurance. Since Copernicus emerged and discovered the system of celestial bodies, and Galileo followed, the physical phenomena of the universe have become increasingly clear. The thinking of the European people has undergone a great change. The superstition of religion and the power of monarchs were no longer able to bind them. Thus, the doctrines of freedom and equality arose, and the countries of Europe gradually moved towards reform. Therefore, the subsequent success of Rousseau, Montesquieu, and others in advocating revolution was actually based on the foundation laid by Copernicus and Galileo. When Newton, Darwin, and others emerged in response to the times, deeply pondered and researched, and wrote books for the world, almost all the people in the world were influenced by them. As the sciences of quality, force, number, etc., have become clear, the cause of utilizing resources and benefiting the people has also been promoted. The theory of natural selection and the survival of the fittest has especially penetrated into people's hearts, making the true outlook on life struggle daily on the path of evolution and dare not slacken. Therefore, those who observe the national situation often say that the rise and fall of a country can be determined by the efforts of scientists in that country. France was greatly aided by Pasteur's efforts in research. In the middle of the 19th century, Britain completely reformed the old system of medieval education, making the whole country scientific. Huxley's advocacy of scientific education was the first merit. Germany and Soviet Russia, after the fragmentation of the country, rose vigorously in a relatively short period. Their power is enough to influence the world. Numerous experts in the country have exerted their utmost efforts to save the country with science. Therefore, if a nation wants to survive in the world for a long time, flourish and grow, and not be conquered by other nations, it must rely on its people to work hard in science. Today, when our country is in this critical moment of survival, if we want to resist strong enemies, preserve national sovereignty, and become a permanently independent nation, we rely on those who are determined and patriotic to devote their efforts to the development of science.

### Metals and Plants

— Xinshan

More than 150 years ago, people in Europe and America began to pay attention to the metals existing in the soil in order to understand how plants grow. In fact, not only does the soil contain many metals, but the plants themselves and their fruits also contain trace amounts of metals. However, these metals cannot exist independently and can only become various compounds with other elements, such as oxides, sulfates, phosphates, etc. Moreover, plants can only utilize metal compounds dissolved in water to achieve metabolic functions.

In the past, everyone thought that plants only need ten elements, namely carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and iron, from germination to maturity. After further precise research, it was discovered that at least eight other elements, namely manganese, copper, zinc, boron, barium, iodine, and arsenic, are needed to help plant growth in appropriate trace amounts. However, if the amount is excessive, it will be harmful to plants or even cause them to wither and die.

For example, if you analyze the ash obtained by burning a shellac tree sap, you will know that the ash actually contains 2.5% manganese. If a solution containing one part per 100,000 of manganese sulfate is used as a fertilizer for barley, the barley seedlings will grow particularly lush. If the manganese liquid is partially sprinkled on the shells of plant seeds, the embryos will grow particularly plump. Furthermore, if plants such as rice, wheat, oats, soybeans, peas, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, spinach, and lettuce are cultivated entirely with soil and fertilizers that do not contain manganese, the branches and leaves will inevitably be withered and lifeless. From this, we can believe that the chlorophyll in plant leaves, as well as the outer shells and inner embryos of plant seeds, cannot do without an appropriate amount of manganese.

Copper, arsenic, and zinc also significantly help plant growth: For example, spraying copper liquid on the branches and leaves of sweet potatoes can kill pests and increase the quality of sweet potatoes. Arsenic can increase the activity of ammonifying, nitrifying, and oxidizing bacteria, making the land fully utilized. Calcium arsenate, etc., can also be used to poison weevils and leaf-eating insects. Furthermore, although various zinc compounds are toxic, some can accelerate nitrification and greatly increase crop yields.

Many people are continuing to conduct research. The scope of research can be divided into three categories: analysis of soil and plants, scientific management of plant growth, and prevention and treatment of plant diseases. If there are amazing achievements in the future, they will greatly benefit mankind. Because in this way, we can improve the quality of plants and increase their yield in agriculture and horticulture, and vegetables, fruits, rice, wheat, etc., can be obtained at low prices. At the same time, in engineering and industry, we can accelerate the growth of wood, increase the supply of raw materials, and open up a new source of fuel.

Scientific Strange Tales

### Ghost Voice

— Jiqian

Years ago, I lived in Nanjing. As the end of the year approached, my family was busy preparing for the New Year. One night, we went to bed later than usual. Suddenly, I faintly heard groaning sounds in the guest room, which were very miserable. However, when I paid attention to listen, I could not hear them anymore. And if I relaxed my attention a little, the sound would come again. My family was afraid, suspecting it was a ghost. I knew it was not true, but I didn't know where it came from, so I held a flashlight and searched everywhere in the room, checking all the desks, tables, and beds. Then, I tried my best to explore the courtyard and behind the house, but there was no trace. I also suspected that there might be a beggar lying sick outside the wall. I went out to look for it everywhere, but there was still no sign. When the method of observation was exhausted, this confusion could not be solved. Some suspected that there might be an ancient tomb underground, and the ghost sound came from it. However, digging the ground and springs was not easy, and it was already late at night, so I had to go to bed. I decided to wipe the table in the morning. When I accidentally pulled its drawer, I suddenly heard the sound again. Upon closer inspection, the old cat raised in the house was lying in the table cavity. The ghost sound last night was made by it. This drawer was carried and played by the child, and the cat was hiding in the table. Since the cat was old and sick, it was imprisoned and could not get out, so it made a distressed sound. Are all the strange phenomena in the world, if we fail to find out the truth, and then suspect them to be ghosts, all of this kind?

### "Cupping" Treats Severe Colds

— Peisheng

Chinese folk methods use fire cupping on the forehead, which is said to treat headaches. Use a small porcelain can, burn a strip of paper into it, and when the fire has not completely gone out, immediately press the mouth of the can on the forehead, wait a while, and it will be sucked on. This is because the air in the can is driven out by the heat, the pressure is reduced, so the atmospheric pressure outside the can presses the can on the forehead and the can does not fall off. Also, because the blood pressure pushes the skin on the forehead into the can, so when the can is removed, a red circle appears on the forehead, because the blood is flowing.

This method is now adopted by Turkish baths to treat severe colds, with the aim of increasing blood circulation. This method sucks many small glass jars on the patient's back, as shown in the figure. First, heat the can on an alcohol lamp to reduce the air pressure in the can, and then combine them one by one on the back. The absorption effect sucks the blood to the epidermis. After the can is removed, there are red marks. According to the use of this method, there is absolutely no pain.

Free Talk

### Titles

— Moxie

What shops rely on is signs, and what individuals rely on, besides appearances, are titles. Signs are valued for being old, and titles are naturally valued for being grand. As long as the title is grand, you don't need any real skills to scare people, just as a shop only needs an old sign, no matter what you sell or how you sell it, others can believe that your goods are genuine and fairly priced. This has almost become a common practice, and there is no need for me to say more.

However, as far as I know, just as signs are sometimes valued for being new, titles are sometimes valued for being long or wide in addition to being grand… In order to comply with the scientific spirit and no longer talk nonsense, I have extracted evidence as follows:

Obituaries or funeral signs often have such formats: "...B.A. from ×× University, graduate of ×× Middle School, graduate of ×× Elementary School." On top of this kind of detailed academic history, there are naturally also detailed official histories, which can even range from "Grand Preceptor to the Crown Prince" to "×× Patrol Inspector." The higher the rank, the more it is placed at the front; and the higher ranks are all later events, so it forms a real "later comes first" situation. This is what titles are valued for being long.

We can also often see business cards with many titles arranged around his name, for example: "President of ×× Society, Liaison Officer of ×× Company, Secretary of ×× Association, Director of Academic Affairs of ×× Elementary School, Manager of ×× Industrial Company, Editor of ×× Bookstore, Receptionist of ×× Shopping Mall…" This is really "wide"! Because they are arranged side by side, it has to be "wide"!

However, long or wide titles are not easy for everyone to have. Those who are enthusiastic about titles, or those who have something to gain from titles, still have to think of other ways. What are the other ways? Borrow!

It is said that there was once a distant relative of a prime minister who was traveling in Suzhou and wrote everywhere on the walls: "××, second cousin of the Grand Prime Minister, once traveled here." A humorous man named Li Zhang wrote next to him, saying: "Li Zhang, a 37th generation descendant of the Primordial Emperor, followed." This can be said to be good at borrowing. Similarly, "The funeral of Grandma Wang, the owner of the tofu shop opposite Wang Wenshao, a Grand Scholar of Wenhua Hall, a Co-managing Grand Scholar, Minister of the Ministry of Revenue..." Using a long string of Wang Wenshao's official titles can be said to be making the most of them. As for the past practice of borrowing the title plaques of relatives and old friends in weddings and funerals, arranging them in front to show off, it seems that this custom has not completely disappeared to this day.

But "if you borrow something for a long time and don't return it, how do you know it's not yours?" After all, borrowed things are not your own, and you always feel a little uncomfortable psychologically. Therefore, those who are enthusiastic about titles, or those who have something to gain from titles, have come up with a way to buy them.

In the past, as long as you were willing to study hard and had real talent and learning, you could pass the exams to become a xiucai, juren, jinshi, or Hanlin, no matter who you were. Now, however, it is not the case. A child has to spend hundreds of yuan in tuition fees to obtain the title of elementary school graduate, and this child's hard work and talent have little to do with it. By analogy, from elementary school graduate to university graduate and calling oneself a scholar, is not different, and the money spent increases later and later. As for studying abroad and returning with a foreign degree, that is entirely the power of money. Wouldn't I be exaggerating too much if I said that these scholar titles were bought? Moreover, throughout history, there have been examples of donating to get titles; donation also involves paying money, which is no different from buying. Therefore, what I said about buying is actually just the meaning of donating.

However, long or wide titles are always better if they are grander, and the borrowing or buying of them is of course to seek grander titles. Therefore, valuing titles for being grand is still an unbreakable truth. Some people, in order to have grand titles, do not hesitate to create them in addition to the above methods, which is even less surprising:

Doctors are called doctors, the owner of a cigarette paper shop is called the manager of a department store; insurance company runners are also managers; the "cadet pump operators" of gasoline company branches are also managers; the owner of a barbershop is a manager; the back-scrubbing elder in the bathroom is the director; the owner of a chicken and duck shop is the president…

Why does everyone like titles? Originally, titles, like appearances, have various advantages, so it is no wonder that everyone wants to obtain them. Moreover, appearances are for people to see, while titles are for people to hear. Those who see are few and those who hear are many, those who see are near and those who hear are far, so appearances are naturally not as good as titles. If a person has a grand title during his lifetime, once it is publicized, he can seize the initiative and make people respect, fear, and cherish him. After his death, he can be included in history books in a grand manner, or in genealogy books in a smaller manner, leaving a lasting reputation for generations. If it is said that the advantages of signs are profitable, then the advantages of titles are purely for fame. It is common for fame to lead to fortune, so there is nothing better. In one's life, who is not for fame and fortune!

Even emperors like certain titles, which shows how deeply titles penetrate people. For example, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang called himself "Li Daolong, a tribute student from the countryside," Emperor Huizong of Song called himself "Moral True Lord," and Emperor Wuzong of Ming called himself "General of Divine Might." Therefore, I also like titles very much. But I have no background. There is no place to borrow here, I have no money to buy, and I don't know how to create them, so I have to give myself the title "common people" of the Republic of China to amuse myself.

### No Border Defenses Between the U.S. and Canada

— Bering

—— A Model of International Amity

At a time when the public is focused on the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line, suddenly discovering a border stretching over three thousand miles with absolutely no fortresses or artillery positions is truly inspiring. This is the border between the United States and Canada, a monument to the common sense of two great democratic nations.

This border begins east at New Brunswick, proceeds along a portion of the St. Lawrence River, and, with the exception of Lake Michigan, passes through all of the Great Lakes. It traverses the Great Plains, crosses the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, and extends west to Vancouver. In many of the more remote areas, there isn't even a single strand of wire to mark the end of Canadian territory and the beginning of American land.

Although this great border is not defended by military means, it is constantly patrolled, though the number of patrolmen, at just over three thousand, seems small. Patrols are necessary to prevent smuggling and illegal entry. Neither the United States nor Canada wants the other's "undesirable elements" entering their country, but as long as proper identification is presented and there are no suspicious signs, people can cross the border from the United States or Canada to the other side without difficulty. In some places, thousands of people cross the border every day to go to work. The authorities provide them with long-term passes, and the workers simply show their passes, just like someone with a monthly pass at a train station. In Detroit, thousands of Canadians who work in American automobile factories cross the border by ferry.

During the Great Depression, many people tried to cross the border illegally from one side to the other. At that time, both Canadians and Americans believed that "the other side" offered better opportunities for development than their own country. As a result, patrolmen employed special interrogation techniques, rarely failing to detect illegal immigrants. For example, if a Canadian claimed to be an American, the patrolman would ask him the name of his city's mayor or similar questions. He might even suddenly ask, "Where did you buy the clothes you're wearing?" If the answer was New York, the patrolman would turn up the person's collar to look at the label and see the name of the clothing store. If it was a Canadian clothing store, the patrolman would send the person back.

One place where people often tried to cross the border was the famous Peace Bridge over the Niagara River. There, people would often claim to be Americans returning to their country and would be allowed to proceed to the Canadian end of the bridge. However, when they reached the American authorities on the other end, they would be denied entry. These people were naturally not allowed to return to Canada immediately and were forced to remain on the bridge. On one occasion, such people stayed on the bridge for several days, unable to go forward or backward, with friends bringing them food. Finally, the two authorities suddenly came up with the idea of flipping a coin to decide the nationality of those whose ancestry could not be determined. For example, the Canadian side said, "If it lands heads, the person is ours; if it lands tails, the person is yours," and they decided the person's nationality in this way.

Tourists traveling by train or car do not encounter such frustrating procedures. Customs officials are adept at quickly inspecting cars, simply having the car drive over a mirror to check that no luggage is strapped to the underside. The inspection procedures on trains are also very convenient. Those traveling by train from New York to Chicago via Niagara are allowed to proceed with ease. In fact, most of these trains stop at convenient locations for inspection, and passengers have about a quarter of an hour to admire the local waterfalls.

In some parts of the West, there are ranches that straddle the border, and people can cross the border a dozen or twenty times a day. In the Rockies and the Sierra, there are deep canyons that are impassable to pedestrians, serving as natural barriers. There are also solitary high mountains on the border that have never been trodden by mountaineers, let alone patrolmen.

It has often been suggested that Canada should unite with the United States. For example, two years ago, someone in the United States introduced a resolution to the House of Representatives to that effect. However, the two countries live together so harmoniously, with so little friction, that such suggestions arouse little interest on either side. (Translated from the New York Evening Express)

### Shanxi's Eldest Brother Watches

### Still Optimistic

— Zhi

Pessimism only spoils things; it doesn't accomplish anything. Optimism is better because it can stimulate the spirit, increase courage, and generate intelligence and physical strength, far surpassing pessimism, which corrodes the heart, discourages people, causes them to retreat, and renders them useless.

In calm seas, one should certainly be optimistic and not engage in morbid moaning or unwarranted pessimism. However, in stormy and dangerous times, it is even more imperative to be optimistic and absolutely not pessimistic. Only optimism can save people from danger and help them reach their destination. Pessimism? It's simply out of the question!

We have always been optimistic, which makes me even more consistently optimistic. Now, some unexpected blows seem to be falling upon us, and I know that many people will inevitably lose their optimistic courage and fall into the trap of pessimism. I want to shout to them: Don't be pessimistic! Remain optimistic!

Under these small blows, pessimism is certainly useless. If we do not want to be slaves of a conquered nation, to be slaughtered by others, we must still strive and work hard to achieve our great goal of building a free and equal country. We can only regard these blows as insignificant, as inevitable setbacks in the process of life, no, of national construction, with optimism. We have our goals, our methods, our determination, our conviction. We are not afraid of any blows; we can overcome anything.

Moreover, the current blows cannot yet be considered blows. First, the impact is small, and second, the truth has not yet become clear. Furthermore, the current international situation is extremely complex. What is lost in the "east corner" can be gained in the "mulberry elm." As the saying goes, "If this place doesn't keep a man, there's always another place that will." I say, "If this place doesn't help a man, there's always another place that will." To put it more plainly: "If this person doesn't help me, there's always someone else who will." Looking at it from both sides, what reason do we have to be pessimistic? Pessimism is just worrying about something that might never happen!

Taking ten thousand steps back, even if we are ultimately going to fail, to perish, I would still like everyone to gloriously, worthily, with a smile, shed our last drop of blood! We will never be pessimistic!

However, as long as each of us is willing to shed our last drop of blood, we will never fail, we will never perish. I want everyone to stand tall, take a deep breath, and continue to struggle, continue to work hard!

Remain optimistic! Each of us must have such firm conviction in our hearts!

Words and Deeds

There was such a time, perhaps in the era of Rudin, when words, beautiful words, held noble meaning. Eloquent oratory and astonishing rhetoric seemed to represent everything.

Action became insignificant; it was as if one did not need to consider deeds when speaking. As a result, one felt as if one were constantly surrounded by magnificent arguments, never lonely, but ultimately uncomfortable.

However, I say that in the face of facts, words are a superfluous existence—naturally, this is just a new way of stating an old saying.

This is the current era: the era of action. We demand something more practical. Let us have less empty talk and more of the power that each of us possesses! Everyone should use their hands to support this suffering nation, "Give one share of heat, emit one share of light." Even if it is meager, it is genuine.

### Finance: Wealthy Merchants Concentrate on the Gold Market, Speculation Actively Rises

Yesterday, the spot market for cash speculation in this city, although foreign exchange had stabilized, the gold rush was still actively developing. Although the daily fluctuations were not as large as in the previous days, it was still easy to rise and difficult to fall, with a difference of 170 yuan. It soared from 2,500 yuan to 3,670 yuan at closing. Continuing to rise another 140 yuan was actually due to the Tokyo Conference, which saw the British attitude soften and a compromise reached between Britain and Japan. Wealthy merchants in this city turned their buying interest away from foreign exchange and foreign currencies, focusing on collecting gold, leading to a sudden depletion of circulating funds. In the early morning, reports that President Chiang had made responsible statements regarding legal tender and foreign exchange greatly stabilized public sentiment, and foreign exchange was stable with a slight upward trend, which caused some selling. It once fell twice from the opening price of 3,530 yuan to the 3,500 yuan level. However, soon, money exchange businesses, certain jewelers, gold dealers, and stock market groups began to actively search for goods on behalf of pawnshops. In a situation of only buying and not selling, the upward trend suddenly became fierce, soaring close to the 3,600 yuan mark at noon. In the afternoon, it was heard that foreign exchange had turned from loose to tight, and buyers became even more aggressive, soaring to a high price of 3,670 yuan at closing. Public sentiment had changed from fatigue to firmness, and trading was slightly clear, with a total of about 2,000 taels in the morning and afternoon. Gold jewelry was once quoted at 5 yuan less, but ultimately 370 yuan, up 10 yuan. Chinese and English pure gold continued to fall, and customs gold remained flat.

Gold Prices Are Easy to Rise and Difficult to Fall

Since the morning, the initial price per bar (ten taels) lacked change due to the relatively flat foreign exchange market. Initially, a certain cash shop released twenty taels to a gold shop, and a certain bank released thirty taels, with the price still at 3,530 yuan. Subsequently, upon hearing news of firmer foreign exchange rates, public sentiment became anxious and immediately fell by thirty yuan. A certain money exchange business sold fifty taels to a gold shop at a price of 3,500 yuan. Shortly after, a certain money exchange business immediately repurchased fifty taels from a certain bank at a price of 3,510 yuan. At this time, another money exchange business suddenly came to sell, heavily dumping downstream, selling fifty taels to a certain bank at 3,505 yuan. Subsequently, it crammed a total of fifty taels into a cash shop at a price of 3,500 yuan, which was the lowest price of the day. Although foreign exchange rates were reported to be loose at that time, a certain speculator from Hong Kong suddenly entrusted a certain money exchange business and a certain jewelry store to search for goods on their behalf, totaling more than 300 taels. In addition, the jewelry store group also bought more than they sold, and the upward trend suddenly began, soaring to ninety-five yuan. A gold shop released ten taels to a stock market group at a price of 3,595 yuan. The above were all supplied by another money exchange business and cash shops. Near noon, due to slightly weaker buying interest and another money exchange business continuing to sell, the situation slightly improved. Another money exchange business released ten taels to a stock market group at a price of 3,580 yuan. Later, the jewelry store group also released twenty taels to a certain broker at 3,570 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. In the afternoon, a certain gold shop absorbed a considerable amount on behalf of speculators, and the opening price was five yuan higher. A certain gold shop took in fifty taels from a money exchange business at 3,575 yuan. After opening, hearing that foreign exchange rates had softened, sellers suddenly became scarce, and it immediately冲out beyond the 3,600 yuan mark. A certain gold shop took in thirty taels from a jewelry store group at 3,605 yuan. After this, stock market groups also came to track and search for goods, and the market situation became even firmer, soaring sixty-five yuan. Money exchange businesses mutually traded fifty taels at 3,670 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening. As a result, it rose sharply by 140 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total fluctuation of 170 yuan throughout the day. The quoted price of cash shops was 10 yuan higher. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there were a few transactions.

Quoted Gold Rises Another Ten Yuan

The兑出price of gold jewelry in jewelry stores initially remained unchanged. At 9:50 AM, because speculation had slightly weakened, it was also quoted at five yuan less. Later, at 11:36 AM, it returned to five yuan higher. At 2:13 PM in the afternoon, it was quoted five yuan higher, and at 3:50 PM, it was quoted another five yuan higher. As a result, it was quoted ten yuan higher. It is estimated that major firms changed to 370 yuan, while new firms were at 368 yuan. However, there was no fixed price for the purchase counter.

Pure Gold at a Small Halfpenny

London, 24th – English pure gold continued to fall by a small halfpenny per ounce, reaching £7, 8 shillings, 5 and a half pence. As a result, the Bank of China's cash buying price also continued to fall to 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold remained flat at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold also continued to fall by 4 jiao, estimated to be 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.

### Gold Pounds Continue to Rise, Australian Gold Notes Also Rise Three Yuan

Yesterday, foreign currencies fell in the morning due to loosening foreign exchange rates. In the afternoon, the exchange market softened, speculation激涨, and the market was very firm and rising. In reality, foreign currencies were scarce, and the supply was not smooth. English and American gold pounds and gold notes rose sharply. Japanese gold notes also rose with the market. The evening price was 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 3 and a half fen. Korean notes were in high demand and rose sharply. The evening price was 9 jiao and 4 fen.

### Sassoon Actively Closes Forward Positions, The Foreign Exchange Market Suddenly Turns Tight, Swap Interest Rates Reach More Than Nine Points

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the exchange rates listed remained unchanged. Although the dark market for English and American exchanges considered the news of a compromise between Britain and Japan, President Chiang's responsible statement regarding legal tender and foreign exchange initially calmed public sentiment. The chaotic situation was extinguished, and the situation stabilized. In addition, Hong Kong telegraphs were抛塞before, and Sassoon and the Bombay Banking Corporation followed with sales. Therefore, the market situation had a slight softness. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that Japan would make further demands on England, so speculators became active. In addition, Western merchant Sassoon also aggressively absorbed in the futures market. As a result, the situation suddenly tightened, and the closing price was finally 4.5 jiao for English gold and 8.8125 yuan for American exchange. There were some swap transactions in the middle. It was heard that a certain bank塞出 cash and 套进 August, estimating that it paid Shanghai Textile Factory's American dollars 875, with a monthly interest rate of about 9.13%. Conversely, it would not be possible to贴出 a monthly interest rate of less than 1 jiao and 1 fen. Overall trading was still strong. There were few transactions for the Hong Kong exchange. The selling price was about 31 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen.

The Morning Market Was Quite Stable

In the early morning, the recent London big bar回縮0.0625, the forward price remained flat, New York silver prices remained stable, London raw gold continued to be a small halfpenny, the exchange rate of English to American was unmoved, to Shanghai fell 1.875, to France did not change, American to English unmoved, to Shanghai a big triangle, to France grew 0.0625. The central listed exchanges remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 4.5 jiao 53125 for English gold and 8.8125 yuan for American exchange. Compared to the previous closing, English was slightly tighter by 0.03125 and American was slightly looser by 0.0625. After opening, Hong Kong Telegraph first 塞予 foreign firms such as HSBC spot English gold 4.5 jiao 5625 and spot American exchange 8.875, making the situation quite stable. When the exchange listing was announced, it remained unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was announced to still be exempt. After this, Western merchant Sassoon suddenly came to sell, and the Bombay Banking Corporation also came to供塞, so the market situation was stable with a slight firmness. It is estimated that Sassoon and the Bombay Banking Corporation successively sold spot English gold 4.5 jiao 5625 and 59375 and spot American exchange from 8.875 to 96875 to HSBC and other foreign banks and a certain American bank. It was heard that foreign firms and speculators also absorbed, mostly American exchange. Later, the English bank was able to absorb the American firm's August American exchange at 8.0625 yuan. At times, there were some swap transactions. It is estimated that a certain bank塞出 cash and 套进 August, estimating that it paid Shanghai Textile Factory's American dollars 875, with a monthly interest rate of 9.13%. Nearing noon, the Japanese Bank's regular gold suddenly came to扒进 the foreign bank's August American exchange at 8 yuan, and the situation turned flat. At the time, it was heard that the Hong Kong exchange was状带 soft. The bank's spot selling price was only 31 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. By the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were estimated to be 4.5 jiao 59375 for English gold and 8.9375 yuan for American exchange, which was tighter by 0.25 and looser by 0.125 compared to the morning opening.

August American Exchange Enters the 8 Yuan Mark

Although the Japanese bank came to抛塞later, Western merchant Sassoon suddenly came to猛吸 futures, and foreign firms and speculators had a good appetite, so the market situation gradually returned to flat. It is estimated that the Japanese bank sold spot English gold 4.5 jiao 5625 and spot American exchange 8.875 to foreign firms. Later, Western merchant Sassoon aggressively扒进 the foreign bank's August English gold 4.03125 and 4 jiao and the same month's American exchange for 7.84375. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 4.5 jiao for English gold and 8.8125 yuan for American exchange. Compared to the previous day's evening closing, both English and American exchanges were tighter by 0.0625.

### Cash Released, Discount Rates Rebound and Fall

Yesterday's exchange draft discount rate has begun to rebound and fall. The price per thousand yuan lowered from 240 yuan in the morning to about 230 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, cash continued to be released, further lowering to 220 yuan (the exchange draw for cash is still at a 70-80% discount), a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry's interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 1 jiao and 6 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.

### Securities: Domestic and Foreign Bonds Have Shown a Turnaround

The dark market for securities slightly rebounded yesterday. After the trend of bank withdrawals expanded, the financial community was forced to sell off its old foreign exchange and gold reserves to obtain legal tender for adjustment. Banks, in turn, profited from this. Previously, the only tool for adjusting finance was public bonds. At this time, selling public bonds only yielded exchange drafts, and at a very low price, requiring a very large discount to obtain legal tender. As a result, foreign exchange and gold were able to achieve a small康, and the pressure on public bonds could also be reduced. Yesterday, due to President Chiang's statement, public sentiment was stabilized, and market prices rose by about 1 yuan. It was heard that it rose another 1 yuan or so after closing. These were relative transactions between individuals, so the difference could not be logically explained. Buyers in the market were the 14th and 16th, and also Yongfeng, Daqing, and Renchang. The sellers were Lianhe, Hengfu, Defu, and the 11th, and Maochun sold a considerable amount on behalf of Le Mao. Therefore, the market was still volatile. The future still has多头出脱, so there may still be twists and turns. As a result, the market price improved by 7 jiao to 1 yuan and 3 jiao, with a trading volume of about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing　Compared to Previous Day

Unified A　51.60　50.80　51.60　Up 1.20

Unified B　43.40　45.00　43.30　Up 1.20

Unified C　42.50　41.50　42.00　Up 0.85

Unified D　41.10　41.00　41.10　Up 0.90

Unified E　1.80　41.50　41.55　Up 0.70

The listed prices of London's Chinese foreign debt on the 24th of this month (Monday) slightly increased. The English-German continued loan and the English-issued debt note rose by 2 pounds, with a price of 40 pounds. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway's original continued issuance of loans rose by 1 pound each, with a price of 12 pounds. The Beining Railway loan rebounded by 5 pounds, with a price of 45 pounds.

The Kailuan Mining shares fell by 9 pence, with a price of 16 shillings and 9 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

### Cotton Yarn: Small Cloth Factories Close One After Another, It Is Difficult to Expect a Revival in the Yarn Market

The yarn market is slightly softening. In fact, prices have entered a high realm, and digestion only relies on the south of Jiangsu. Apart from this, there is little hope for development. Investigating the reasons, one half says that financial tightening and the tightening of bank funds are increasing daily. The other reason is that funds from the interior are strictly prohibited and not allowed to be remitted to the occupied areas. From this point of view, there is no hope for loosening funds in the future. The other half is that the sales of cloth are narrow. Weaving the yarn into cloth not only does not generate profits but also incurs losses. Therefore, the sound of cloth factories closing their doors and stopping work is rampant.

Regarding the current yarn situation, the market atmosphere was scattered in the early morning, and everyone was generally bearish and held a搶帽子principle. As for the brokers shouting to sell, the opening price fell by 10 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse was 545 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 532 yuan. Although there was some做作among them, shortly after, it was heard that the opening of foreign exchange had stabilized, and浮言 disappeared. Buyers also increased, and market prices slowly rose. In an instant, the warehouse price of 20-count Double Horse foreign yarn was 552 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price also reached 541 yuan. There were no major changes along the way. According to the statistics of half-day transactions, 825 bales were traded. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 4 yuan compared to the previous day, Five Sons fell by 10 yuan, and coarse yarn fell by 45 yuan. Only 20-count Shepherd rose by 2 yuan, due to its lower base. The factory opened 10 bales of 10-count Special Jincheng from the Yong'an Factory at a price of 598 yuan. Today, there were 90 pieces of cotton yarn transported to Hong Kong and 95 pieces transported to Xiamen. The amount purchased by each group is listed on the left:

Hong Kong 395　Yunnan 10　Inland 20

Industry 400　Total 825　Previous Day's Transactions 140

The Japanese yarn market is still depressed and sluggish. Because of the lack of banknotes and cash flow, and because small cloth factories have closed down completely, there are few outlets for the yarn. Therefore, the selling price of現紗is still in a stagnant state. However, most are extremely bullish on next month, and prices are surprisingly high. In addition to asking for twenty yuan higher than the current price, the current asking price for 20-count Yueqin yarn is 410 yuan, and the price for next month is estimated to be 431 yuan.

### Factories Are Canceling Forward Contracts for Foreign Cotton

The cotton trade has seen some transactions, but factory appetite hasn't expanded significantly due to tight credit. The market situation remains unchanged. As for foreign cotton, factories are increasingly abandoning previously ordered forward contracts. This is due to the drastic shrinkage of exchange rates and the shortage of legal tender funds, to avoid future difficulties when the goods arrive in Shanghai. The supply from Northern Jiangsu continues uninterrupted, with 289 bales of Tongzhou cotton recorded. The current cotton conditions are listed below:

Changyinsha packed cotton: 113.00

"Fire Engine" cotton: 85.000

"White Rock" cotton: 101.00

The "Duck" shipping vessel, "Shetland," managed by the Great Britain Company, arrived from Calcutta this morning at 9:00 AM, carrying 1,300 pieces of cotton. It docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is rumored that a large quantity of Indian cotton is also expected to arrive in Shanghai this month.

Regarding foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai, the announcement of US cotton export subsidies yesterday translates to a reduction of 23-24 yuan per picul in legal tender terms. However, due to unresolved exchange rate and financial issues, only previously purchased cotton can be settled with foreign firms. Although this yields a profit of over ten yuan per picul, the future shortage of raw materials leaves only the option of reducing production to cope with these difficulties.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was excited due to the weekend's government export subsidy report. The opening saw a jump of over ten points. Later, booming spot transactions in the South and adverse weather reports from cotton-growing areas triggered purchases by new accounts. By the close, due to profit-taking by bullish investors, the market still ended up ten points higher than the previous day's prices. The Indian cotton market was affected by the US cotton export subsidy, with yesterday's prices and predictions falling nearly two rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by over ten points.

Defeng Factory imported 20 pieces, transferred by draft to the factory.

Fellow traders imported 85 bales, delivered through the currency exchange.

Also, 10 pieces. In addition, several hundred pieces of fine twill, coarse cloth, and colored cloth were imported. Dyeing factories imported over one hundred bales of satin gray and twill gray fabrics. Sales of these fabrics are better in Southeast Asia. There were transactions for 3,000 bolts of colored cloth and bleached twill. Sales offers from factories have mostly switched to current yarn prices, causing significant fluctuations. In the past, orders were placed at fixed exchange rates, with factories relying on a premium of 50-60 yuan at the time to purchase raw materials. Recently, the premium has unexpectedly surged, leading to substantial losses. Yesterday, the Dyeing and Weaving Factories Association discussed demanding that customers discount to 95% for cash payments, but customers insisted on the original agreement and refused to concede. Disputes are escalating.

Eastern Piece Goods

Yesterday, the market for fine cloth and fine twill remained stable. The spot price for "Dragon Head" fine cloth remained at 14.3 yuan per bolt, with a decrease of 0.1 yuan for next month, at 14.9 yuan. Sales to customers were minimal. Local merchants are holding 500-600 pieces of current and forward orders for fine cloth and fine twill, but traders are not opening sales. The market is quiet but firm.

Today, 115 pieces of finished cloth were exported to Xiamen and 60 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Refined White and Coarse White Both Down Slightly

According to yesterday's London telegram, nearby August sugar was at 7 shillings 1.25 pence, up 0.25 pence. December remained unchanged. Next March saw a slight decrease of 0.5 pence, to 6 shillings 2.25 pence. The association's price: 24.4-24.5 yuan for coarse white. Our warehouse: 34 yuan. Other warehouses: 33.7 yuan. Transit goods: 25.5 yuan. Taikoo refined white fell similarly. B mark, Western warehouse: 36.5 yuan. Eastern warehouse: 36.3 yuan. Western warehouse CW mark: 36.3 yuan. CX mark: 36 yuan. DY mark: 35.4 yuan. HX mark: 35.2 yuan. H mark crude red: 22.5 yuan. Spot Dutch red: 27.5 yuan, unchanged. Transit goods fell slightly, from 20.8 to 20.6 yuan. Our factory's crystal small: 0.5 yuan. Grade 1 crystal: 37.5 yuan. Jingming crystal: 39 yuan. National sugar: Guangbang offered 300+ bags of Huizhou white, priced at 36.75 to 36.3 yuan, settled at 32 yuan. Over twenty bags of Hainan ocean sugar at 29.2 yuan. Youtoubang offered over one hundred bags of sliced cyan sugar at 16.5 yuan.

On the 25th, 32 cases of sugar slices arrived from Hong Kong, and 1,780 bags of sugar arrived from Xiamen.

### Finished Cloth: Discount Rates Rising Daily; Factories Demand 95% Cash, Customers Insist on Original Exchange Rate

National Cloth

Yesterday, the cloth market was quiet. Tight credit conditions significantly restricted spot sales and hoarding activities. Weihaiwei traders offered over one hundred bales of 16-pound Double Elephant and Kui brand coarse cloth. Guangdong traders offered 50-60 cases of colored cloth, colored twill, and serge, as well as thirty-plus bales of 16-pound and 14-pound Earth brand coarse cloth. Local hoarders...

### Grains: Customer Sales Unabated, Flour Market Stable

Flour

Yesterday, the flour market stabilized. Factory prices, after rising by 0.2 yuan over the weekend and the first two days of this week, have been considered high. Moreover, factory sales require cash payments, causing some issues for customers. Therefore, sales have not been particularly strong. Yesterday, traders from both northern and southern provinces maintained their sales appetite, with transactions of several thousand bags each in Tianjin, Weihai, Shantou, and Xiamen. However, large-scale disposals are not yet occurring. Currently, most factories have reduced production, and production is limited. Given the high prices and the increasing cost of foreign wheat, those holding goods are unwilling to compromise to sell them off. Hence, the market is fairly stable. Grade 2 flour stood at 4.85 yuan, unchanged. Transactions totaled over 30,000 bags, all jointly handled by local and northern/southern traders. Today, 28,200 bags of flour are being shipped to Xiamen.

Wheat

Yesterday, the supply of new wheat continued uninterrupted. Most of the newly arrived goods were placed in warehouses for sale. Currently, flour mills are experiencing poor sales. Although some hoarders are interested, this is not a normal sales channel. Therefore, sellers are unwilling to compromise to sell off their goods. Yesterday, 1,200 bags of wheat from Suzhou, Kunshan, and Taicang were sold, priced at 6.7 to 6.8 yuan. The market was relatively stable.

### Where Will Rice Prices Rise To? Speculation Suggests 23 Yuan, Saigon Rice at 26 Yuan

National Rice: Yesterday, due to price controls, prices could not rise further. Although there were rumors of private deals at 23 yuan, concerns persisted, leading to a lack of supply from merchants. The market was essentially stalled. Only South Port early and late rice was traded, at 20 yuan, but only thirty dan were sold. Wuhu polished rice was traded at 16 yuan, and Su hot rice at 15.4 yuan. Other varieties, such as thick japonica, Duyang pointed rice, and others, saw no market activity. Rice merchants are truly pushing millions of people to the brink, causing unrest and giving others a reason to worry about Shanghai's security. Total city transactions amounted to only 375 bags and 30 dan. However, sources from various routes arrived at South Port, including 12 early/late rice, and nearly 3,000 bags of Qigao, Chelnin, Baozi Laiqingjiao, and Fengjing goods.

Customer Rice: Yesterday, store hoarders maintained their appetite. Traders from inland provinces and rural areas also inquired. As the price of polished glutinous rice was low, customer traders competed to purchase it, driving up the price by 0.5-0.6 yuan. Glutinous rice also rose to the 16 yuan limit. Polished glutinous rice was only directly allocated to customers, with no formal market trading. Customer traders moved over 1,000 bags, and local merchants moved 4,000 bags.

Foreign Rice: Sellers insisted on higher prices. New Saigon rice was unwilling to sell easily, with prices called at 26 yuan. Buyers found the price too high and no agreement was reached. However, old Saigon high-quality rice, previously approved by the Public Works Department, also reached 25 yuan. Total city transactions amounted to over one hundred bags.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Steadily Rising, Sales Volume Declining

Recently, the soybean market has been steadily rising. However, sales volume has inevitably declined. Export activity has been lively, but mostly handled by foreign merchants for transit. Yesterday, only local traders inquired about the market, with a total of three cars of Dalian Sipingjie soybeans traded, with prices frequently rising from 10.096 yuan to 11.2 yuan. Also, 176 bags of Bengbu soybeans at 9.5 yuan, 160 bags of Wuhu soybeans at 10.07 yuan, and 100 bags of Hankou first-crop soybeans at 10.02 yuan.

On the 26th, 210 bags of soybeans and 10 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Xiamen.

### Dried Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Rises by 25 Yuan, Still Insufficient to Meet Demand

Longkou vermicelli has been out of stock for a long time. It is rumored that over four hundred pieces have arrived, but most are for transit. Therefore, only about one hundred pieces were offered for sale, resulting in extremely high demand and prices. Previously sold for 70 yuan, it now reaches 95 yuan, a sudden increase of 25 yuan, which is still insufficient to meet demand.

### Coal: Slack Coal Sells Briskly in Under-the-Table Deals

The slack coal business is typically slow during this time of year, but due to the sudden shrinkage of exchange rates, demand has surged. However, the supply from producing areas is limited. Although there are several thousand tons in stock in Shanghai, they are controlled by a certain foreign firm, leading to a perceived shortage in the market. Under-the-table prices have risen repeatedly. Grade 1 Kailuan slack costs 44 yuan per ton, and Grade 2 costs 36 yuan. Traders are conducting cash transactions, selling from warehouses, with local merchants adding a 4 yuan commission.

### Seafood: Black Moss Stocks Dwindling

The previous stock of black moss has gradually dwindled due to continuous sales. There have been no new arrivals recently, so lion's mane moss is out of stock, and prices are firm. Xilan and Longya moss are both selling at a cash price of 29 yuan.

### Hardware: New Galvanized Wire Prices Rebound

The new galvanized wire market has been active recently. Local factories are aggressively purchasing it, and hoarders are also buying in large quantities. Yesterday's transactions totaled an estimated 500-600 dan. Prices are rising due to limited spot availability and high costs. Grades 21 to 25 sell for 60 yuan, while Grade 25 single-strand fancy wire requires 80 yuan. Coarse fancy wire also requires around 40 yuan. Mid-range goods are priced below 40 yuan. Due to low inventories and high demand, the market is exceptionally brisk.

### Medicinal Materials: "Shan Nai" Grade Goods Nearing Depletion

Since the fall of Shantou, the source of "shan nai" has been cut off for a long time. Current inventories are limited to a few merchants. Recently, traders have shown strong interest, but sellers are unwilling to release their goods easily, leading to mutual hoarding. This may create unprecedented high prices.

### The Evolution of Woolen Fabric Patterns: Dislike the Old, Love the New... Prolonged Use Means Outdated; Trendy Patterns... Mostly Renovated Old Styles

The popularity of woolen fabrics and textiles has truly grown with each passing year. The changes in their patterns and the rise and fall of sales are too numerous to describe. Thinking about the buying, selling, and ordering aspects of this industry, I have gathered some real historical information to write about, and I offer it to all circles.

Around 1917-19, the woolen fabric business boomed like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Yellow-green tweed and printed tweed for overcoats sold very well, with strong buying power from traders in South and North China. Rongtai and Hanli were the most famous for tweed, while Heji's double-color brand was the oldest for printed tweed. Later, due to the outbreak of the European War, goods could not be delivered as scheduled, and the British exchange rate rose to 8-9 shillings. Some woolen fabric firms in Shanghai went bankrupt due to losses. After the storm passed, patterns and sales had already changed. At this time, five-color overcoat fabrics were popular, with the Haohua brand being the most prestigious, followed by Anli Luhuatang. Melton cloth was also very popular, with Deji Dulanxiang being the leading brand. Velvet fabrics such as black "qiang," yellow "qiang," silver "qiang," sable, leopard skin, long-haired, yellow-black otter velvet, large and small sea otter velvet, and double-sided yellow camel velvet were selling well. Double-sided yellow camel velvet was best known for Rongtai's "Recruiting a Son-in-Law" and Deji Foreign Firm's "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats" brands. The popularity of pearl velvet and cloud-patterned velvet was very strong. Northern traders favored these fabrics because the climate was colder than in the South, leading to the popularity of Chinese-style overcoats.

In 1927, the Northern Expedition unified China. Thick fabrics with large plaid and solid colors were popular, while thin fabrics with blended colors and plaid Walter tweed were popular. Felt fabrics were also popular, with strong demand from local customers for shoe uppers. At that time, Yuanzhigong cloth was known for Rongtai's 15330, Hefeng's 21127, and Deji's 1336, as well as Anli's Jubao Basin and Public Welfare Gold Pagoda brands, all of which were widely sold. As for colors, those suitable for Chinese clothing materials, blue-gray colors were most popular; foreign red and ash-gray mixed colors were also briefly popular, but sales were far less than blue. Later, dark green and snuff colors became popular, with snuff colors remaining popular for a longer period than other colors. At the same time, Chinese jacket materials were eliminated, and the sales of Chinese jacket fabric, snowflake fabric, and zhigong fabric declined sharply. Starting in 1929, newly arrived riding breeches fabric became very popular. (Riding breeches fabric had already been sold to piece goods traders in earlier years. It was originally intended for making riding breeches, hence the name riding breeches fabric. Now, local traders have innovated and promoted it as a material for lined overcoats.) Chinese overcoats all rushed to use it, because it was durable and suitable for spring, autumn, and winter, resulting in a sharp decline in the sales of thick overcoat fabrics. At that time, domestic wide and narrow camel velvet was launched, with Wei Yi and Wei Lun being the first. As a result, velvet fabrics such as "qiang," otter, sea otter, and leopard skin fabrics gradually fell behind and disappeared. Polish plain thick cloth suddenly became popular, due to the need for military uniforms. Yellow serge also saw increased sales. The changes in woolen fabric patterns at this time also included iridescent Walter tweed, herringbone small plaid serge, patterned gray serge, small hat patterned fabric, and plaid mottled fabric, which were also very popular. Those that fell behind and became unsalable were miscellaneous serge, pearl tweed, plaid Walter tweed, and plaid overcoat fabric.

After 1931, women's colored overcoats became popular, leading to a surge in the sales of women's miscellaneous-colored overcoat fabrics. Chinese clothing materials, regardless of color or pattern, saw few changes. However, cheap inferior goods also flooded the market, and customers bought them because of their low prices, causing the sales of Western mainline serge and robe fabric patterns to decline. Another difference was that domestic yarn-hair backing cloth was refined, with increased production and lower prices than imported goods, which customers welcomed, and the market was completely taken back by domestic products. (Imports have been seen to disappear in recent years.) Horsehair sleeve lining and feather yarn, as well as black charcoal lining, also saw a sharp decline in sales. Because silk-gloss feather yarn was invented, it was extremely popular. Horsehair sleeve lining also had domestic products available, and black charcoal lining could be replaced by Ningbo Jiangshan horse tail lining, resulting in a 50% decrease in imports. After the January 28th Incident, wearing Western suits became like a rising tide. The opening of Western-style clothing stores in this port city increased continuously every year. The patterns of Western suit fabrics changed, including new Hanlimeng, Palisi, Fan'erding, herringbone woolen fabric, white canvas, and Hailisi, etc. The colors changed fleetingly, including stripes, large plaid, medium plaid, small plaid, solid colors, herringbone, "ban si," and oblique patterns, and were not fixed. Because Western suit fabric patterns were unusually numerous, most were selected by customers.

In recent years, the trends in woolen fabrics have changed. In terms of colors, those that sell well include Chinese clothing materials' dark, common, gray, camel, and blended colors, and Western suit materials add a vegetable green color. In terms of patterns, stripes are the most popular, followed by small plaid. The rest depend on the proper mixing and weaving. Patterns that are not too bright, but generous and elegant, are best. For Walter tweed, blended colors are popular for robe fabrics, dark blue is popular for Western suit sets, yellow is popular in military circles, solid serge is popular in dark blue, and patterned fabrics, in addition to large plaid coarse patterns, are best when they are delicate and clear. The most fashionable women's overcoat fabrics are seahorse white and screw velvet, and Western suit fabrics with Western characters on the edges are popular. Riding breeches fabric and camel tweed are popular for lined overcoat fabrics. For Western suit overcoats, Houms four and Hailisi are popular in spring and autumn, and heavy gray solid hair cloth is popular in winter. Flannel feather yarn fabrics, fat leather 巴勒呢 , white serge, white zhigong, hemp glue cloth, and white canvas are popular in summer. Single-sided waterproof raincoats made of dark gray 开水米 are consistently popular.

International Financial Market

Financial issues are extremely complex. Since transportation is convenient and the market is widespread, the world is united as one. Therefore, a change in the financial situation of one country can have an impact on the entire world. There is undoubtedly some organization involved in this, and financial markets such as those in London, New York, and Paris hold the key, implicitly wielding control over the world's financial markets. Markets everywhere seem to listen to their commands. Since the major upheaval in international finance in 1931, countries such as Britain and the United States have successively abandoned the gold standard. Gold, which for decades had been the supreme and highest quality currency material, has lost much of its luster. The news spread, and other countries followed suit, creating the current situation. Today, if one does not understand the situation in the international financial market, they may be caught off guard by events, leading to unpredictable consequences. This book covers the causes and consequences of financial panics in various countries, the forced abandonment of the gold standard, and the organization and operation of major financial markets in London and New York. It thoroughly investigates the facts, providing detailed analysis, research, and accurate descriptions. The translator, Mr. Liu Kongjun (Fuzhong), has worked in the financial industry for many years and is very fond of research. He has translated the original book by John T. Madden and Marcus Nadler, professors at New York University in the United States. It details the functions and operations of the world's major financial markets, as well as the systems of major national banks and the international financial tasks of various markets. It can serve as an aid to those who aspire to research. The book is published by the Zhengzhong Bookstore on Sima Road.

### Shanghai Children's Hospital Established

— (Yi Su)

Creating Welfare for Sick and Impoverished Children is a Great Virtue; We Hope All Sectors will Enthusiastically Donate for Free Beds

The Shanghai Children's Hospital, founded by Shanghai elders, was established the day before yesterday (the 24th). Its address is a clean and quiet Western-style building with about twenty rooms, located at the intersection of Moore Road and Fuxu Road.

It was transformed from the Shanghai Refugee Children's Hospital and the Weihaiwei Road International Red Cross Infant Hospital. The reason for the merger, it is said, is that the number of refugees in Shanghai is gradually decreasing, and the authorities of the two hospitals believe that the two hospitals can be merged. They held a meeting in May and resolved to establish a new hospital, named the "Shanghai Children's Hospital." Its current address is the former Shanghai Refugee Children's Hospital.

A relative of mine, Miss Zhang, works there as a doctor. With her guidance and permission, I accompanied her on a tour. The top-class ward has one large bed and one small bed, with the large bed for the patient's parents to accompany them. The first-class room being toured did not have any children occupying it. Only a foreign girl doll was placed on the small bed. Near a table was a wooden model of the foreign house. There are five such rooms, each bed costing four yuan per day. The second-class room being toured has three large and small beds, occupied by sick children, and parents accompanying them. There are five such rooms, each costing two yuan. The third-class rooms have ten beds each, costing one yuan per person per day. I heard that this fee is not for profit, but only to cover expenses. The hospital has a total of one hundred beds, with eighty free beds. These free beds are donated by charitable organizations and enthusiastic individuals. Those who donate for a full year will have their names hung on the bed. For example, donors who donate in memory of Dr. Niu Huisheng will have "In Memory of Dr. Niu Huisheng" printed on the plaque in Roman characters.

Almost every ward is filled with sick children. The older ones are six or seven years old, the younger ones are one or two years old. There are also newborns.

When walking into a ward for lung diseases, I asked why those with infectious diseases were not isolated. Miss Zhang replied, "We don't admit infectious diseases here. These are mild lung diseases." She pointed to a sick child as an example, "This child's heart is on the right side..." Hearing these words, I felt relieved. Not all of these sick children are poor, because the granddaughter of the great scholar Tang Wenzhi is lying on a second-class bed.

The hospital pays attention to the diet of the sick children. Walking to the entrance of the kitchen, a smiling lady in charge said, "Welcome, please come in." The stoves use electricity. The utensils, such as bowls and cups, are very clean and tidy. Record sheets and recipes are hung on the wall.

Miss Zhang led me to the X-ray room and pointed, "This X-ray machine was originally prepared by Tongde Hospital, worth seven thousand yuan. Li Yunshan's family and friends contributed five thousand yuan to purchase it from Tongde and donate it to this hospital in memory of Mr. Li. Tongde lost two thousand yuan, meaning they made a donation." The operating room has not been completely decorated. The lights in the room shine like daytime, and the floor is covered with rubber. All major and minor operations are temporarily performed by consulting doctors, with surgical fees charged appropriately. Touring the outpatient clinic, I learned that consultations are held every afternoon from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Poor and sick children sent by shelters are treated and given free medicine. Other outpatient children are charged one corner, with medication priced at cost. Outside the textile supplies room, Miss Zhang said, "This area stores clothing and other items donated by the hospital's women's auxiliary..."

Currently, there are still many refugees in Shanghai. In this cold and hot weather, disease may inevitably befall them. If they are not treated, their lives may be lost. However, the Shanghai Children's Hospital has not filled its quota for free beds. We hope that enthusiastic people in society will donate generously to benefit those poor and sick children.

### Introducing a "Subsidy Method for Employees"

— Small Employee

Recently, the soaring rice prices in Shanghai have greatly affected the general population, especially those on salaries. Therefore, banks and major stores are finding ways to subsidize their employees, but each has its own method, and the standards are inconsistent. Here, I would like to introduce a relatively reasonable subsidy method for everyone's reference.

This is a method used by a major bookstore to subsidize its employees:

(1) Take the highest rice price published daily in the newspaper as the standard. If the monthly average reaches 16 yuan in national currency, all employees will receive a subsidy of 1 yuan in national currency; if it reaches 17 yuan, a subsidy of 2 yuan; if it reaches 18 yuan, a subsidy of 3 yuan; and so on. Trainees receive half.

(2) If the rice price gradually falls, the subsidy will also gradually decrease. No subsidies will be given when the price returns to within 16 yuan.

(3) This method is limited to one year, from July of this year to June of next year.

The following points are worth noting in the above method:

(1) The original highest rice price set by the department was 14 yuan, which has been in effect for several years. Therefore, an increase of one yuan has a small impact and does not require a subsidy, but an increase of two yuan (i.e., to 16 yuan) is already felt, so the subsidy begins, which is very reasonable.

(2) Designating the highest rice price published daily in a certain newspaper as the standard, and using the monthly average rice price as the standard for subsidies, is very scientific. Moreover, increasing and decreasing subsidies according to the rice price indicates that this is a genuine subsidy and not a disguised salary increase, which can eliminate all kinds of unnecessary concerns.

(3) All employees are treated equally. Of course, the proportion of the subsidy is smaller for those with higher salaries, and the proportion is larger for those with lower salaries. (For example, if someone making 100 yuan receives a 5 yuan subsidy, it is only 5%; while someone making 20 yuan also receives a 5 yuan subsidy, it is 25%.) "The great have great difficulties, the small have small difficulties." High-level employees seem to be at a slight disadvantage here, but their daily lives are generally easier to maintain. Therefore, this is another method of particularly considerate to low-paid employees, especially since workers are treated the same, which is truly rare! As for trainees, because they are still young and have not yet started a family, halving the subsidy is also very fair.

(4) This method is limited to one year, which is also very reasonable. Because in these years, things change rapidly, and no one can predict the future, so a limited-term method seems to be more appropriate.

### Rain After the Storm

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 14: Fireworks in Thousands of Homes, Rural Cooperation, Waves of Ten Thousand Li, Overseas Flight

Why say it's nonsense? Those who come to China for inspection are all experts. How can we dismiss it with a single stroke? However, regarding the so-called hundreds or thousands of years, we must see how the world uses coal in the future. Who knows, in a few decades, a revolution in world fuel may occur, not affecting these coals? Some scientists are trying to find ways in the sunlight, without having to dig out the black gold from the mines piece by piece! On the day of the year 2000 AD, we don't know what the scene will be! But at this moment, the coal in Shanxi can always be said to be inexhaustible and inexhaustible. The reason why the country wants to control it is because China's coal exports have been very high in recent years. As for rural areas, they still burn mountain firewood, thatch, and other natural fuels, which are left to the people's freedom and are not subject to control. Today, the two He family sisters came to the countryside for a tour and found it very interesting. They had never been to the countryside to play before, and this is a new village, they feel that the fun of the countryside is more interesting than the city. Zhu Ai'ren also bid farewell to his grandfather, mother, and the He sisters and returned to Anle Town. They rested for one night and will write to their father tomorrow, informing him in detail about accompanying Ai'ren to Freedom Village to visit Ai'ren's grandfather, Village Chief Wei, and going to inspect the factory site. They are discussing several things with their father: one is the construction of the house. Because the factory site has been decided in Freedom Village, they must prepare to build factory buildings. The land that Village Chief Zhu led them to see yesterday is a place with convenient land and water transportation. Although it is said that it can only be decided after being approved by the village council, this is not a problem. However, there are various differences in the design of the factory building. Each factory has its own style, and each factory has its own suitability. A machine factory cannot be built in the same way as a textile factory. Because these are all to place machines in the factory building, the factory building and the machine are very related. However, contemporary construction engineers have a clear plan in mind for those methods, and they are not wrong at all. Haven't the two He family sisters said long ago that if they build a factory building, there is a ready-made engineer here? Isn't that ready-made engineer Lin Jiancheng, the fiancé of Jin Danyu? After deciding on the address, they can make a decision and go with Lin Jiancheng to see it. Not only Lin Jiancheng, but also Jin Danyu. However, their wedding is near, don't disturb them because of this matter. (163)

### Directed "Deferred Debt Repayment"

— Xia Xia

When I pick up the pen, I simply don't know what to write. Is it because there is nothing to write? No, on the contrary, it is precisely because there are so many thoughts in my heart that I don't know where to start?

Since Shanghai fell as an isolated island, many pioneers in the theater industry, those who are capable, have left one after another. Therefore, in this period of "Shu has no great generals, Liao Hua fills the vanguard," even a low-energy person like me has actually become a director. This is really as awkward and slippery as forcing a duck onto a shelf. I can't help but feel my heart beating, sweating, and ashamed when I think about it. But can I say that because of my incompetence, I should give up the opportunity to do my best and contribute a little effort to the suffering compatriots? No, no, a thousand noes, ten thousand noes, even if I am 120% incompetent, useless, even if the heart and effort I can contribute are as small as a sesame seed, it is always better than nothing, because even though sesame seeds are small, when gathered together, they are still useful, so I decided to do my best in this charity performance. I would rather shamelessly and immodestly agree to direct the play "Deferred Debt Repayment." I am willing to be embarrassed, make a fool of myself, be disgraced, suffer, and I am prepared to hear people scold me for not being qualified and too presumptuous. I am waiting to accept all bad criticism about the play, but I am not willing to give up this opportunity to do my best for the suffering compatriots.

Now is no longer the era of national prosperity and ruin, but every man is responsible. The country does not belong only to men, but to every citizen. Patriotism does not distinguish between men and women, young and old. What men can do, we women must also do, because we are the same people, we are the same citizens, and we are equally responsible to the country.

A wave of emotion rushed, and I couldn't stop myself. I don't know what else I would say if I continued to write. In order to maintain my consistent principle of "talk less, do more," let's stop for now. Fortunately, the day when I can happily and thoroughly say everything in my heart is not gone, so let's leave it for then.

Now I only hope that my friends who care about me can give me more strict guidance and criticism on this play "Deferred Debt Repayment" that I directed, because I need your guidance and encouragement to improve.

Finally, let me ask all the Chinese people in Shanghai for those suffering compatriots: "Dear compatriots! Come! Come to the Golden Theater to see the play! Because this play is not only for entertainment, but behind the entertainment there is a greater significance. Every Chinese citizen should come to the Golden Theater to see the play without hesitation! Come on! Everyone come quickly!"

### Lively Scene by the Sea

Lord Jin, the magistrate of Nanhui County, has been in office for more than a year. He resigned from his official post last month and was transferred to Wujiang. A few days before his departure, the gentry all prepared farewell banquets. For days, they flew cups and sang drunk, almost like Zheng Station retaining guests. Those who sent plaques and those who sent tablets were endless on the way. When he set off, the carriages and horses filled the streets, and the voices of people were boiling. When the magistrate composed a farewell poem and boarded the carriage, banners and flags stood in rows along the way, flying in five colors, counting several pairs of plaques praising his virtuous administration, eight canopies of the people, and items such as clothing of the people. Among those who sent him off, there were those with white hair, those with white beards, those in yellow clothes, and those in red shoes, all holding incense and kneeling to see him off. The magistrate immediately got out of the carriage and leaned over to lift them up one by one, giving them reward silver. At this time, the viewers were like walls, and everyone had the desire to cling to the wheels and the feeling of lying on the tracks. However, there was one thing that spoiled the scenery, that is, a person carrying a grass basket filled with paper money for the dead, and also using several bundles of silk paper, burned it to the right of the South Gate, alas! These are probably people who have failed to exploit the people. On that day, various kinds of tricks emerged. Men and women crowded to the scene, almost more than two thousand people, and the seaside suddenly became a lively scene.

### Four Courtesans of Yan City

There are many famous courtesans in Yan City, but not as many as in the past. However, there are four courtesans who all have nicknames. One has snow-white skin and a flower-like face and is called White Bread Cake; one is like a peony painted entirely in ink and is called Black Bread; one has a face like a full moon and is called Mantou Wu'er; and one has a pair of sharp jaws and is called One Nest Cake. A certain vice minister was intimate with all four beauties and hated One Nest Cake for being too self-important. Therefore, he wrote a bamboo branch poem to mock her, saying: "Don't boast that the white bread cake's face is heavily covered with silk gauze, she has had her neck fondled by the Mantou; after all, it is not as good as the black bread, the most boring is the two One Nest Cakes." When One Nest Cake heard this, she was furious and asked a hooligan to bring the vice minister to her, counting his faults to his face, and then they argued with each other. The vice minister had long harbored resentment, so he smashed all the objects in the house, the pearls were broken and the jade was shattered, the mirror was broken and the bottle was overturned. After people persuaded them to disperse, One Nest Cake sobbed all night and hanged herself on the bed, but fortunately, the madam woke her up, otherwise, she would have died a tragic death.

### Big Boss, Second Boss - A Tale of Rivalry in the Wilderness (2)

— Li Feishu

—Miscellaneous Memories of the Plum Blossoms—

Originally, their feelings were not harmonious, and there were many opportunities for conflict. Whenever it was triggered, just as they were about to fight, they were always persuaded to stop, unable to do what they wanted, and both felt regret in their hearts! Unspeakable disappointment!

One day, because of a small matter, the two quarreled again. Fortunately, there was no one else around, so the two decided to find a quiet and uninhabited place and have a good time, decide who was superior, so as to avoid being depressed all the time! After the two agreed, they clapped their hands to show their great faith. On that day, both were overjoyed, shook hands respectfully, and bid farewell.

The struggle of the strong men began the next day. After the performance that day, they walked out of the backstage together. As they walked, they discussed with each other: "Where shall we go today?" "How about Heilongtan in Nanxiawazi?" "Okay!" So the two walked towards Heilongtan.

Heilongtan: It is the most desolate place outside the South City, with lonely graves piled up and weeds stretching endlessly! There is no human habitation nearby, and it is a place rarely visited. Except for the corner of the battlements hidden far away in the "clump of decaying willows," and the cold and clear "Taoranting" like a "Xiao Temple in the deep mountains," all that can be seen is only the "white clouds floating in the sky" and the "emerald mountains of Western Beijing"! It is truly "unlimited flat sand, no one to be seen," a good battlefield!

They reached their destination, took off their tops, and revealed the beauty of the muscles of men! They began to fight with force. Their fighting method was very special. It was not like boxing, with the two twisting into a ball. They first had one person take off his top and stand still, not moving, except for the parts that could be fatal, and the other person could hit him however he wanted, without being allowed to fight back. When the person being hit felt satisfied with being hit, and the hitter was exhausted, they would rest for five minutes, sit on the ground, and still talk and laugh as usual. After the rest, they would repeat the process, changing people to hit. The two had agreed in advance that if anyone shouted "Ouch!" in their mouth first, then they would "show weakness"! They would tacitly admit that they were "defeated"! They would not be considered "heroes."

After the first day of fighting, no one made a call of weakness, and without a winner, it was considered a "draw." The two reaffirmed their determination to continue their efforts! Come again tomorrow. On the way home, they talked and talked, as if nothing had happened. Only a few crows flew back and forth in the shadow of the setting sun, constantly calling, as if praising them as "good men"! "Good men"! Besides, no one knew about this "humorous secret."

In this way, they fought for a month, and still could not determine who was superior. Nor was it ever discovered by a third party.

### Miss Chen Yanyan Speaks Tearfully and Sadly: Movies Are My Life (Middle)

— Cold Fragrance Notes

A History of Film with Eternal Regret

...A Chance Encounter When Entering the Screen

A relative of the family is the owner of the "Zhongtian Cinema" in Beiping City. I have loved movies like crazy since I was a child. Because my relative's family opened this theater, I had many opportunities to watch movies. At this time, I watched almost all Chinese and Western films, without exception. Many works by Ms. Yang Naimei, Ms. Zhang Zhiyun, and others made me watch them as if drunk and fascinated, to the point of watching five or six episodes in a row; - especially Ms. Zhang Zhiyun, I admired her the most, and can be said to be her most loyal believer. However, I didn't have any thoughts of entering the screen in my heart at that time. Later, in the early spring of 1931, I was eighteen years old: I suddenly encountered an extremely coincidental opportunity: Mr. Luo Mingyou initially founded the Lianhua Film Company in Shanghai, and he personally led Mr. Sun Yu and the late Ms. Ruan Lingyu and other staff to Ping to shoot the real scenes of the ancient capital for the first film "Dreams of the Ancient Capital"; at the same time, they happened to live in the hotel "Dongan Hotel" jointly opened by my father and uncle. From this, I gained a special opportunity to get close to them, following them around to watch filming during the day; and talking with them in the hotel room in the morning and evening; talking like that, they said that "you are also very good at filming and are a promising talent on the screen." One word moved me, and I was overjoyed, and suddenly ignited my fiery passion, and started further negotiations with them.

...Strict Father Lost Happiness and Died with Regret

The Lianhua authorities sincerely recruited me, and we hit it off as soon as we talked, and the terms of the five-year contract were also negotiated. Unfortunately, my father was extremely opposed and could not allow it. His old ideas thought that movies were not a very proper profession, and girls mixed in it were very easy to learn bad habits. Originally, I also knew my father's intentions. In the past, in order to study, he was unwilling to let me run to school, and to leave home to film movies was certainly impossible. However, I really liked movies too much, and no matter what, I must fight for this move to do this job. Therefore, I cried and cried at home and resisted very fiercely. I said to my father: The quality of people is uneven, that is always the case, not only in the film industry; people only need to make up their own minds, even if the environment is bad, they may not be assimilated. If I go there and I am determined to come back as a good person, I will not come back if I am not a good person.

My father was very sad to hear this. My mother did not add any opposition, but said: Wherever my daughter goes, I will go with her. Later, after many people persuaded him, my father just shook his head and sighed, and he also disliked the contract period of five years as being too far away, and he did not agree. And my opinion was that even if I signed a ten-year contract, I still had to go. Lianhua's contract, as a rule, had to be signed by the parents to be valid; under my father's firm insistence, it became the biggest obstacle in reality. Until the Lianhua foreign scene team finished their work and left Ping, I followed them on the train regardless of everything; my father rushed to the station immediately, watching me shed tears non-stop; an elder of the family was with him at the scene, seeing this stalemate, it was difficult to reverse, so he used a forced method to hold my father's right hand on the platform, and forced him to sign the contract by the car window, and then it was over. However, although my mother and daughter were full of joy when they arrived in Shanghai, and thus entered the film industry; my father was lonely and unhappy, and also always thought it was very wrong, and after only half a year, he became ill for me and died with lasting regret. (Speaking of this, tears fell, and I sobbed incessantly.)

### Anecdotes from Liyuan

Because Yan Jupeng's popularity reminded me of Guan Dayuan's frustration.

Since things are rare, they are valuable. Although Guan Dayuan's performance has nothing particularly amazing, he can always be described as stable. He would never be like a certain old actor (also a amateur who became a professional) invited by a certain stage this spring, who sang out of tune and out of sync, and was booed off the stage by the audience several times. How could the owner of the opera house invite such an actor? Isn't this too much of an insult to the audience? No matter how unsellable Guan Dayuan is, he is still a person with more than thirty years of stage experience. Moreover, he has been taught by famous teachers and has many plays in his repertoire. If he really comes to the south, he can also perform some old plays that are not often seen, to change things up. Plays and actors are the same, there are those that are timely and those that are not. In recent years, I have really been discussing "Catching and Releasing Cao", and these timely plays have made the audience's heads dizzy. If the wrong actor is allowed to sing the out-of-date plays that have been shelved for many years, it may make the actor popular and the play popular. What's so amazing about "Second Entry to the Palace"? Because there are a few more old words (fishermen, woodcutters, farmers, readers, counting the four seasons of flowers and the names of ancient people), it can actually cause a sensation. Even I, who don't listen to an episode of opera in a year, ran to taste the freshness, which shows that the friends in the opera circle also like the new and dislike the old. In fact, to put it bluntly, is not the new still dug out from the old stuff? Now I boldly say a word. If someone has a good voice and can sing plays like "Chopping the Son," "Xiaoyao Jin," and "Taking Chengdu," as long as he can make the audience feel happy, who will care about your Liu or Sun school? But the most important thing is not to use strange tones to please the audience, so as not to lose the status of a famous actor. (67)

### Behind-the-Scenes of the Movie Star Photo Exhibition

— Yu Zhengyong

The Chinese Movie Photo Photographers Association, in cooperation with the Shanghai Refugee Skills Training Center, held the Chinese movie star photo exhibition at the Daxin Company on the fourth floor yesterday (the 25th) at 10:00 am. At that time, it was drizzling, but the guests were still very enthusiastic. I also went to visit. I will now record the behind-the-scenes of the opening in a jumble to enrich this publication.

At eleven o'clock, in front of hundreds of guests, Mr. Lin Kanghou first gave the opening speech, and movie star Yuan Meiyun cut the ribbon. Ji Zhiyou, Shi Yuejuan, Gu Lanjun, Li Hongzai, Miss Yang and others entered the venue one after another, and the audience rushed to the door to see the style, surrounding the movie stars in a circle. Although the staff tried their best to maintain order, they still had the pain of not being able to move. So Miss Mei Jun was left alone (because it was her day to sign autographs for movie fans who bought photos), and the rest hurried away.

On this day, Mr. Lin brought four children to the meeting, and watched the movie star photos on the wall in order. Especially when they walked to the towels, toys, embroidery and other products displayed by the Refugee Skills Training Center, they watched them very carefully, and asked the reception staff from time to time, looking very concerned.

What caught the eye in the venue were ten thirty-inch large color photos, with mirror frames, which were very pleasing to the eye. These photos are priced at one hundred yuan each, but if there are more than two people competing to buy, then the person with the highest price will buy it. Now a picture of Lu Ming has been ordered by Zhujiang Daily in Hong Kong via telegram, and Yantai Zhangyu Winery has ordered a picture of Zhou Xuan, but whether there are any bidders will have to wait until the end of the conference.

There are about five hundred other fourteen-inch photos, and dozens of them have been booked. For example, "Anonymous" ordered two copies of Chen Yunshang, one copy of Yue Cuiying, and a total of five papers. And many people had already ordered photos of Wang Yang the night before the opening. These gentlemen can be said to be very enthusiastic, and Miss Wang can also be proud of it.

Finally, I would like to ask movie fans not to give up this rare exhibition, and to order more to benefit thousands of refugees, so that they have the opportunity to learn skills and become independent. It is truly a great merit!

Free "Mulan Joins the Army" Book Cards: The Shanghai Amateur Theater Charity Joint Performance will be held at the Golden Theater from the 24th to the 30th of this month. The plays will be performed in succession every day, and the grand occasion will be unprecedented. At that time, there will also be a kind of small book card of the woodcut book "Mulan Joins the Army" written by Chen Hejun, which will be given away during the performance of "The True Story of Ah Q" by Gonghualian. The small book card is extremely exquisite and beautiful, and is rare. Spectators should pay attention.
