### Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Telegram to the Nation: Hoping that Local Gentry and Elites Will Serve Their Hometowns to the Best of Their Abilities and Personally Lead the Way in Promoting Military Service and Developing the Economy

(Chongqing) Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the gentry, elites, and educators throughout the country on the 19th, hoping that they would serve their hometowns to the best of their abilities and personally lead the way in promoting military service and developing the local economy, to make up for the inadequacy of government decrees and to accelerate the completion of tasks. The original telegram is recorded below. All provincial governments, provincial party headquarters, municipal governments, and municipal party headquarters should forward it to the gentry, elites, and educators throughout the country for their consideration. The War of Resistance has entered its later stages. Success or failure, rise or fall, all depend on whether we can promote national integrity to strengthen the power of a protracted war. In particular, it depends on people of high reputation in counties, districts, townships, and villages throughout the country to bravely take on the responsibility for the fate of the nation. For thousands of years, our country

Has taken loyalty and filial piety as the foundation of the nation.

Cultivating oneself and benefiting the world is seen as the basis. It is known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Those who conform to this are admired by the world, and those who violate it are despised by the nation. This is indeed what our ancestors and sages painstakingly promoted to form a social atmosphere, especially unifying the will of the nation as a whole to strive for survival. Books and famous theories expound on the morality of our nation, especially highlighting loyalty and filial piety. Today, when we are in a period of life-and-death struggle with violent enemies, everyone must vow to be loyal to the country and do their best to be loyal to the nation in order to revive our country and protect our nation. As the saying goes, "When the wind blows, the grass bends." From ancient times,

The success of implementation relies on the strength of the masses,

And the responsibility of promotion lies with local heroes and outstanding people. If we do not rise up in time today, personally practice and do our best for our hometowns, and exhaust our responsibility to defend the country and the nation, and preserve the heritage and undertakings painstakingly created by our ancestors, then we will inevitably sit idly by as our descendants are slaughtered and enslaved. Without loyalty or filial piety, we will not only have no face to face our ancestors, but we will also be despised by the people of the world.

Master or slave, honor or disgrace, is a matter of a moment.

This is what all our compatriots, especially the wise men in various places, should deeply and thoroughly reflect on. The Japanese pirates have invaded our country and committed atrocities to the extreme. From the four northeastern provinces to North China and Southeast China, wherever the Japanese pirates' blades reach, they slaughter, rape, burn, and plunder property, implement poison gas, and destroy production. Tracing their obvious evil intentions, they not only want to destroy our country, but they also want to eliminate our race. Fortunately, since the War of Resistance, relying on the military and civilians throughout the country, we have deeply understood the great meaning of loyalty and filial piety and vowed to fight to the death with the violent enemy. Some are racing to carry guns, fighting with flesh and blood on the front line, or donating wealth and destroying their homes without hesitation, or exhausting their labor and braving dangers to engage in increasing production and saving the destruction during the war.

Fighting for nineteen months,

Although the enemy's invasion is deep, the more deeply they fall into the quagmire, the more difficult it is for them to advance or retreat. The enemy country's international situation is deteriorating day by day, and domestic measures are exhausted. The whole country is in panic, filled with the terror of impending doom. All the changes will not be beyond our expectations. The final goal is getting closer and closer to us. On the other hand, it is precisely because the enemy knows that it is on the verge of danger that it will inevitably try its best to make a final attempt. If the compatriots throughout the country relax even a little at this time, then not only will all previous efforts be in vain, but the tragedy of defeat and destruction will be imminent. If we can

Clearly see the difficulties and increase our efforts,

Relying on our vast land and population, we can strive to replenish human and material resources, and the great task of overcoming the enemy and completing the national rejuvenation can also be achieved soon. This is truly the time for all of us, from top to bottom, including local sages, to serve our country in time, and it is also the fate of our country for thousands of years to come. Regarding ways to replenish human and material resources and strengthen the power of the War of Resistance, the central and local governments should step up their efforts to organize and promote them rapidly. I, Generalissimo, hope that the virtuous gentry, elites, and educators in various places will serve their hometowns to the best of their abilities, personally lead the way, to make up for the inadequacy of government decrees and to accelerate the completion of tasks. The main points are as follows: (Telegraph on the 19th) (To be continued)

Editorial

### The Notes of the United States, Britain, and France to Japan

On December 31st, the United States presented a note to Japan regarding the overall situation in the Far East; on January 14th, Britain followed suit; and on the 17th, France followed suit again; their voices echoed each other, and their momentum was like a string of pearls. It has long been rumored that the world's democratic powers will take parallel diplomatic actions against the aggressor in the Far East, and it is only now that it has begun. Looking at the notes of the three countries, the wording is different, but their meanings are all the same; there are five main points: 1. Their rights and interests have been greatly infringed, and they can no longer tolerate this; 2. The promises that Japan has made in the past have lost all credibility; 3. The so-called new order is exposed as merely a pretext for closing the door; 4. The state of affairs changed by force cannot be regarded as valid; 5. The Nine-Power Treaty and other international treaties cannot be unilaterally abandoned and must still be respected. The tone is firm, and the meaning is serious, which is rarely seen in international documents; considering that for several years, countries have pretended to be deaf and dumb, and have responded to each other with superficial diplomatic rhetoric, it is indeed a step forward.

How Japan will respond to the notes of the three countries is still unknown. According to what has been revealed by their opinion leaders, the Japanese government will use three conditions as the basis for negotiations with Britain and the United States: 1. Complete liberation of the Eastern countries, including the elimination of China's colonial status and the freedom of Eastern people to travel and reside; 2. Complete freedom of trade in the world, including the cancellation of existing economic groups, the abolition of tariff barriers, and import quotas; 3. Fair redistribution of raw materials, including the freedom to purchase raw materials that are indispensable for national survival and the protection of natural resources necessary for national defense. It is said that only in this way can all disputes be naturally resolved. Is this what the Japanese authorities think, using propaganda as a probe, as a prelude to negotiations? No. Why? Japan is the culprit of aggression, definitely not the protector of the weak and small. Judging from the path of their thoughts and actions, there is absolutely no such conclusion in logic. Furthermore, it is said that Japan, because of its failure to invade China, will also automatically give up its control over Korea, Taiwan, and the Pacific mandated islands; this is also something that cannot be believed in terms of common sense and reason. Even if we analyze the meaning of the freedom mentioned in their first and second items and the dominance mentioned in the third item, it is easy to find their contradiction and prove their insincerity. Some say that when things are exhausted, they change, and when they change, they become unblocked; how can we know that Japan is not suddenly changing its plans? Some say that if you lay down the butcher's knife, you can become a Buddha on the spot; how can we know that Japan is not suddenly awakening? This must be a politician with great wisdom and insight to be able to have such a grand vision; Japan has intellectuals with wisdom, so there is this saying; Japan has no politicians with wisdom, so there is no such thing. Otherwise, after launching a military invasion since September 18th, it can be proved everywhere that their actions are wrong, and there are opportunities to rein in the horse and pull back from the precipice at any time; this is also the case after July 7th and August 13th; however, they are stubborn and have fallen into a stalemate where they cannot stop. This is固以以 the fact that there is no one politician in their country who has the benevolence and courage to reverse the situation. Moreover, giving up aggression and tying it to conditions that are not related to each other at all, can this be regarded as a sudden awakening or a change of plans? Playing with the tricks of counter-attack propaganda, still regarding answering back as a gain, then we know that the normal path implied by the three countries is still something that Japanese politicians cannot make good use of!

In fact, it is originally a luxury to suddenly expect a change in the Far Eastern situation due to the notes of the three countries. The talks by US Secretary of State Hull yesterday and the day before, as well as the commentary in the London Times and the telegram from its Tokyo reporter, can be said to have seen through its hidden meanings. What we cannot let go of is: since the countries deeply regret that Japan has only used empty words to perfunctory, and they also clearly know that the Japanese authorities can also understand that empty words are not enough to solve the problem; however, they still do not thoroughly confirm that empty words are the inevitable response to empty protests, and they do not vigorously implement effective methods other than empty words; this is extremely uneconomical from any point of view. Some believe that the countries have separately protested to Japan, then separately provided aid to China, and then taken parallel diplomatic actions against Japan. Each stage has taken a considerable amount of time; then, from the beginning of parallel diplomatic actions to effective practical methods, there must also be a distance of time. This is indeed true. Therefore, we can imagine Japan's response to the notes of the three countries: to fully utilize its diplomatic time and strive to expand its space for aggression. In China, it will carry out its military actions to show its strength in occupying and destroying; it will carry out its political actions to exhaust its skills in dividing and anesthetizing; it will carry out economic actions to satisfy its desires for plundering and exploitation. Internationally, it will use international contradictions, contradictions between regions, races, political parties, classes, and agriculture and industry within countries, and contradictions within the news industry in various aspects of diplomacy, propaganda, and social movements to carry out its tricks of threats and enticements, and sowing discord to disperse the power of international parallel actions. Didn't we hear yesterday that there is a secret organization in Japan called the Ziyun Society, which published advertisements in newspapers to threaten US President Roosevelt; knowing that President Roosevelt will never be intimidated by threats, yet they still do it, which also shows that Japan in the near future will definitely do everything possible.

Chinese reinforcements have now arrived to counterattack. The Japanese troops have also increased to more than 2,000 men, with seven or eight artillery pieces. The Japanese troops who collapsed from Sunqiao on the 17th joined forces to attack the Chinese side. Also, more than 2,000 Japanese troops in front of Zaoshi are also advancing towards Jingshan, including a unit of more than 400 men, with two artillery pieces, who have bypassed to the rear of Sunqiao and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops.

### The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is Approaching; Party and Government Officials Arrive in Chongqing One After Another; The Agenda of the Conference Will Be Announced After the Opening; The Government Held Meetings to Exchange Views

(Chongqing) Although the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is about to open, the time and place of the meeting are kept strictly secret. Special badges have been issued to the representatives attending the meeting and the staff of the venue. Leaders from the party, government, and military circles from all over the country are arriving in Chongqing daily, which is the only symbol that the session date of January 20 is approaching.

### Spokesman of the Ministry of Finance Talks About the Issue of Interest Payments on Foreign Debt; People in London Expressed Welcome; Prices of Public Bonds Rose by One Pound

(Chongqing) According to a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Finance, the temporary suspension of interest payments on foreign debt by China is not a deferment of payment. As soon as China regains control of the customs revenue in the Japanese-occupied areas, it will immediately prepare to resume interest payments on foreign debt. The total amount of foreign debt owed by China is 2.5 billion yuan, and the monthly interest required is only 18 million yuan. If it were in peacetime, there would be no problem in paying this interest. Last year, the average monthly revenue of the customs was still 20 million yuan, four-fifths of which would be enough to pay the interest on foreign debt. But now, four-fifths of the ports are occupied by the Japanese army, so the Chinese government has to instruct the Central Bank to use the customs revenue from the ports still under Chinese rule to pay part of the interest on foreign debt. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 19th)

(London) The remarks made yesterday by the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Finance regarding public bonds secured by customs duties were welcomed by people in London today. The prices of Chinese public bonds all rose by one pound and there was a slight demand. Chinese people from all walks of life believe that the announcement that China cannot continue to pay is partly intended to draw the world's attention to the fact that China is still trying to raise funds separately to pay off debts even though it is engaged in the war of resistance against Japan. People here generally believe that the remarks of the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Finance are an indication that the Chinese government is now making efforts to seek a satisfactory solution.

### Zhou Enlai Discusses Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; Communist Party Made Two Suggestions; Fifth Plenary Session Will Discuss

(Chongqing) Leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang are currently seeking closer political cooperation to consolidate the nation's united front. Regarding this matter, Zhou Enlai, the sole Communist Party official in the National Government, made a statement to an Associated Press reporter, stating that the current war of resistance has made the cooperation between the two parties closer. Although party members of the two parties may have different political views, their ultimate goal is the same: to fight in the united front and build a new China. To achieve this goal, the Communist Party wants to make two suggestions: First, it requests that the Kuomintang allow Communist Party members to join Kuomintang youth groups and other organizations. The Communist Party will submit a list of those who join to the Kuomintang authorities, and will prohibit Communist Party members from enticing Kuomintang members. Second, a joint committee should be organized between the two parties to promote cooperation between the two parties. These proposals will be submitted at the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee meeting to be held in the middle of this month. If the first point cannot be accepted, then the second point should be acceptable. Zhou believes that there is no major conflict between the Chinese Communist Party and capitalism. He said, "The most important land and capital issues have already been handled by the government, which may greatly satisfy Communist Party members. The method of handling it is not confiscation, but rather disposal in a legal manner. If disputes arise between landlords and tenants, the government will come forward to arbitrate and adjudicate. Therefore, before the Xi'an Incident, some land in northern Shanxi was confiscated, but it was immediately returned. Almost all large enterprises during the war are managed by the government. This experience can prevent major social and economic problems from occurring in China when it becomes a truly democratic country in the future. China's nationalization of major enterprises and undertakings is sufficient to avoid the social problems encountered by the United States, Belgium, and France." Regarding the point that Britain and the United States are unwilling to assist China because they fear China becoming communist, Zhou Enlai said, "The Soviet Union has no political ambitions towards China. If Britain and the United States assist China to protect the rights and interests of the South and Northeast, and the Soviet Union continues to help China in the Northwest, then China will surely win." If Britain and the United States abandon their aid to China, then we will definitely ask the Soviet Union to give us more assistance. Although the Soviet Union has given us the greatest assistance, we currently have two difficulties: First, to make Britain and the United States understand that the Soviet Union has no ambition to interfere in China's internal affairs, and its purpose is only to protect itself and prevent Japanese aggression. Second, maintaining Sino-Soviet transportation is quite difficult." Zhou said that arming farmers to continue the war of resistance will not lead to civil strife after the war of resistance is completed. He said, "Chinese farmers will not use their arms to confront the government, because in addition to implementing military education, we also implement political training. In the future, we will pay attention to land tenure, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and usury problems, so that all difficulties between the government and the people can be permanently avoided."

### League of Nations Appoints Subcommittee to Discuss Chinese Proposal; Gu Weijun Also Appeals to the United States, Hoping for Powerful Action Outside the League

(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations held a secret meeting at 3:00 PM today. Gu Weijun, the chief Chinese representative and Ambassador to France, immediately submitted a draft resolution, the content of which included the various suggestions already listed in yesterday's speech. The most important of these include: (1) Member states of the League of Nations should provide financial and economic assistance to China; (2) Imports of Japanese goods should be prohibited; (3) The transport of aviation kerosene to Japan should be prohibited; (4) The Chinese government should be provided with all kinds of conveniences in the transportation of arms purchased from foreign countries; (5) The Council of the League of Nations should appoint an adjustment committee to handle everything, composed of representatives of countries with special relevance to the Far East issue. The Council has submitted this draft resolution for discussion, but has not made any decision, only appointing representatives from China, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Yugoslavia, and Latvia to form a subcommittee to discuss it from a technical point of view and report to the Council tomorrow. According to well-informed sources, the Council may reject the various suggestions put forward by the Chinese representative and instead pass a resolution stating the League's connection with China, and reaffirming the resolutions previously passed in stronger terms, namely that member states should individually assist China, and that all actions sufficient to weaken China's resistance to aggression should be avoided. Some quarters here believe that the resolution put forward by Ambassador Gu Weijun has included China's maximum demands, and China may not expect the Council to accept them all. In addition, British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet expressed sympathy for China when they met with Ambassador Gu a few days ago, which has satisfied Chinese people here. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)

(Geneva) Today, Gu Weijun, the chief Chinese representative, appealed to the United States to urge the European powers to implement joint action to boycott Japan. According to authoritative reports, Gu, citing President Roosevelt's message to Congress, stated to the US Minister to Switzerland, Harrison, that China could still win if various countries boycotted Japan. Rumor here is that Britain and France are hesitant to get involved in the Far East dispute due to the current situation in Europe. According to usually reliable sources, the secret meeting of the Council of the League of Nations has in fact rejected China's most important request to the Council - to organize an adjustment committee. Most observers here believe that France, due to Italy's ambitions, and Britain, due to Germany's development in Europe, are unwilling to interfere in the Far East. Gu believes that the United States is the most sympathetic country to China, so he hopes to obtain joint action outside the League of Nations to boycott Japan.

### France Finds it Difficult to Recognize Unilateral Treaty Revision; Document Delivered to Japanese Foreign Ministry

(Tokyo) This morning, an official from the French Embassy, representing French Ambassador Henry, delivered a document from the French government to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The document was drafted by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is heard that it was transmitted to Tokyo at night. The document followed the precedents of the United States and Britain, stating that it was unwilling to endorse the unilateral amendment to the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing China's territorial integrity and administrative sovereignty. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)

(London) The London Times recently published a dispatch from a visitor to Tokyo, stating that after the governments of the United States, Britain, and France successively submitted notes to the Japanese government regarding the need to respect the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, the reaction issued by the Japanese side was very subtle, and did not seem to be officially authorized. Although the Japanese government may not submit a reply quickly, some illusions have been shattered by the submission of such notes by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. "Now, to transform China into a Japanese colony is not considered an easy task even on the Japanese side, but the country's army has already won victories, and the omnipotent countries have also achieved success in Europe, which is where Japan's bewilderment lies. The economic and military security that Japan wants to obtain today can only be obtained in a way that is less severe and more mitigating. It is impossible not to reconsider. Although this is a difficult task, how can Japan's plan to encompass East Asia to complete its self-sufficient group be reconciled with the demands put forward by various civilized countries? It is still difficult to say so far. It is expected that Japan's first step in the future will be to re-provide empty guarantees, stating that once the 'New Order in East Asia' is established, the trade interests retained by the countries concerned will not only not be damaged, but can also be expected to increase."

### Prominent Figures From All Walks of Life in the United States Oppose Japanese Aggression; Stimson and Others Establish a New Association; Advocate for Embargoing War Materials to Japan

(New York) American people who oppose Japanese aggression against China have recently organized an association called the "American Committee Not to Aid Japan in Violence," and elected former Secretary of State Stimson and former Consul-General in Hankou, Green, as chairmen. The purpose of the association is to absolutely prohibit the export of military equipment or raw materials that can be used for military needs from the United States to Japan. Not only metals such as steel and copper, but also large trucks for transporting goods are on the list of prohibited items. The members of the association are mostly well-known people in society, such as Harvard University President Lowell, former Ambassador to Germany Dodd, and others who are most well-known. In addition to directly contacting American exporters, the association will also conduct publicity work in newspapers to encourage members of Congress to propose legislation to ban the export of ships. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 19th)

(Washington) New York State Republican Congressman Fishcher recently submitted a bill to the House of Representatives, advocating that all military equipment be prohibited from export, with offenders subject to imprisonment for no less than one year and no more than five years, and a fine of $6,000. The military equipment transported will also be confiscated. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)

### Shigemitsu Aoi Promotes to Britain; Full of Goodwill and Peace

(London) The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu, delivered a tactful speech at a banquet held by the Japan Association last night, strongly stating that he firmly believed in open diplomacy, and that many propagandists who write about the situation in Japan mostly do not know Japanese or are not familiar with the Japanese language, which is a pity. This kind of lack of understanding will inevitably lead to unpleasant results, because the true facts are almost all arbitrarily distorted. If he could discuss recent events, he could make listeners understand the truth of the situation, but other places have not fully paid attention to this. Now, I only have one word to tell you, that is, we are now wholeheartedly following a path, wanting to create lasting peace and prosperity in one part of our world. Friendly relations with China are especially our wish. We earnestly try to eliminate all suspicions and doubts, and replace them with mutual understanding, in order to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, so as to introduce a new era of lasting cooperation and reconciliation. He meant that now is the time for the two island nations in the East and West to jointly form their increasing peace policy, because the friendship between Britain and Japan is the main pillar of world peace, and without this, peace is in danger. British-Japanese friendship is a major and inseparable part of the structure of peace and appeasement. There are certain elements who wish to see the British-Japanese relationship fall into hopeless tension. The two countries each have their extremist factions, but if we can understand and trust each other, these people will not be harmful. Therefore, the two countries should observe the situation with real sincerity, and no matter what happens, we should remain friendly as before. We must also deal with the current political situation calmly and rationally, and not allow temporary impulses to disrupt our ability to judge, because once the clouds clear and the sun appears, we will see our lasting friendship shining like the Alpine peaks in the sunlight."

Afterwards, he also made a statement to the newspapers, saying, "China's war of resistance continues as before. China and Japan will still continue to fight for a long time. One thing can be asserted: The essence of aerial bombardment is not enough to bring victory." The morale of the Chinese people is still very strong, and they are very optimistic about the future. Cities that have been bombed by airplanes can resume their daily lives as soon as the alarm is lifted. The vitality of the Chinese people is such that the entire territory of China has not been universally affected by the flames of war. Ambassador Johnson is scheduled to visit President Roosevelt tomorrow. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)

### League of Nations Council Meeting Discusses Spanish Events; Aerial Bombardment of Undefended Cities; The Actions of the Aggressor Country Are Inhumane; Spanish Foreign Minister Expresses Determination to Resist

(Geneva) After holding a secret meeting this afternoon to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Council of the League of Nations immediately opened a public meeting to discuss the issue of the aerial bombardment of undefended cities in Spain. The representative of the Spanish Republican government, namely the country's Foreign Minister Del Vayo, immediately delivered a speech, stating that according to the report submitted by the British investigator, the incident of rebel planes bombing ordinary people in the territory under the jurisdiction of the Republican government was obviously intentional. I believe that these planes belong to Germany and Italy. If you ask the Spanish people to disregard this brazenly and even slaughter innocent compatriots in their own country, I really "cannot believe it." Seeing that the Italian newspapers often publish articles praising the achievements of the country's pilots, it is known that what I said is not false. Although the Spanish government army will never retaliate against ordinary people in the occupied areas, "The humanitarian policy pursued by the Republican government will never be changed." As far as the issue of the withdrawal of foreign volunteers is concerned, the Republican government has decided to withdraw all foreign combatants under its command, and some of them have already left Spain. On the Italian side, it is announced that aid to the rebels will be stepped up until final victory is obtained. The difference in attitude between the two is as such. At this point, Foreign Minister Del Vayo concluded, "The people of Spain have decided to resist aggression, and this determination will never waver." After Del Vayo finished speaking, the British representative, namely the Foreign Office official Butler, stated that the aerial bombardment had created a catastrophe in Spain, and hoped that it could be corrected. The Soviet representative, namely Ambassador to France Suritz, continued to speak, praising the heroic spirit of the Spanish nation in resisting "unprovoked aggression," and said that the League of Nations should take action to make international law respected. The Soviet government is prepared to participate in all measures to end the Spanish civil war. The Chinese representative, namely Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, also expressed sympathy for the Spanish people, and said that "Air warfare is not enough to destroy the determination of combatants. It is one of the most useless forms of warfare." It is necessary for all countries to ban the transportation of aviation fuel to Spain. The French representative, Chaflia, finally spoke, condemning various "barbaric warfare methods" and saying that France is prepared to participate in all actions aimed at stopping such acts.

### Italy Openly Violates the Non-Intervention Agreement; The Spanish Government Protests to Britain; Fierce Fighting on the Catalan Front

The document cited the "Jane's Fighting Ships Information" stating that the National Army government had purchased four destroyers and two submarines from Italy in 1937. The document stated at the end that the sale of warships was an open violation of the non-intervention agreement by the Italian government. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)

Barcelona: According to an official report released by the government army's Ministry of Defense last night, there was fierce fighting on all lines in Catalonia yesterday.

### France's Non-Intervention Policy in the Spanish War Remains Unchanged; The Communist Party's Request to Open Border Restrictions Is Rejected by the House Committee

(Paris) Responsible figures here recently announced that Foreign Minister Bonnet will attend the House of Representatives tomorrow or Friday to explain foreign policy, and will announce that the French government has decided to continue to implement its non-intervention policy in the Spanish civil war. Afterwards, the House of Representatives will submit a motion proposed by Radical Socialist Congressman Zschelle for a vote, which advocates maintaining the non-intervention policy, but also maintaining the freedom and security of France's communication with its territories. Although the Socialist Party and the Communist Party hold opposing views, the government can still win a large majority of votes. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)

(Paris) The House Army Committee yesterday overwhelmingly rejected the Communist Party's motion requesting the government to open the Spanish border and transport war materials into Spain.

### Report to the Cabinet by the British Prime Minister: The Course of the Talks in Rome. Attlee Requests Assistance with Arms for the Western Government; Prime Minister Chamberlain Replies That It Is Inexpedient to Comply.

(London) According to a Reuters Parliamentary correspondent, Prime Minister Chamberlain's report to the Cabinet on his visit to Rome was generally in line with the well-informed intelligence released by British sources in Rome at the conclusion of the visit. Cabinet members appeared satisfied with the general effect of the trip. The government seemed to have no doubts that the Anglo-Italian agreement would be fully implemented. The correspondent also stated that regarding the situation in Spain, the Italians are unlikely to withdraw before Franco achieves victory. There seems to be no concern about any future intervention in the Spanish Civil War by any party. (Reuters, 19th)

(London) Following a letter from Major Attlee, leader of the opposition Labour Party, to Prime Minister Chamberlain requesting an immediate convening of Parliament to discuss the Spanish issue and for the British government to join other nations in assisting the Spanish Republic, Chamberlain has replied, expressing his opposition, stating: "If the ban on the shipment of arms to Spain were to be lifted, the scope of the civil war in Spain would inevitably expand as a result. While the consequences of this are difficult to foresee, they would certainly be very serious. The British government does not consider it expedient to comply. Moreover, Parliament will reconvene within two weeks, and it is not clear what benefit would be gained by convening it earlier under the current circumstances." However, the British government will provide assistance to relief efforts conducted by various non-governmental organizations to facilitate the shipment of food to Spain to prevent famine.

### Rajchman Reportedly to Resign; His Technical Cooperation to Aid China Is Deeply Resented by the Japanese.

(Geneva) According to inquiries made by reporters with the League of Nations Secretariat, Dr. Rajchman, founder and head of the League of Nations Health Organization, is likely to be dismissed by the League of Nations Secretary-General, Avenol, under the pretext of budgetary constraints and staff reductions. Rajchman has headed the League of Nations Health Organization for seventeen years and is the initiator and representative of the League's technical cooperation with China. As a result, the Japanese side has frequently attacked Rajchman, accusing him of being biased towards the Chinese. In recent years, Fascist elements have criticized Rajchman's advocacy of collective security and democratic politics. Although the order for Rajchman's dismissal has not yet been formally announced, it is understood that he generally plans to leave the League of Nations Secretariat in early February. (18th)

### US to Build Defenses on Guam; Japan Expresses Extreme Panic, Saying It Is No Different Than Pointing a Gun at a Neighbor's Door. US Naval Base Expansion Plan Approved by the President.

(Washington) President Roosevelt has approved a proposal by the Navy to establish new naval bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The *New York Times*' Washington correspondent has learned that the plan has been approved for an appropriation of US$60 million to begin construction of a major naval port on Guam Island. (Reuters, 19th)

(Washington) Representative Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, stated that he would be introducing a new measure today to implement the proposed establishment of forty-one small air and naval bases. He also stated that he did not know whether the proposal included the proposed fortification of Guam. Japan attaches particular importance to the proposal to fortify Guam. Representative Vinson said that the proposal is now in President Roosevelt's hands, and he does not intend to disclose its contents before the full text is made public, reportedly to avoid unnecessarily provoking Japan. Local circles are paying close attention to Tokyo's report that a Japanese naval spokesman stated that the fortification of Guam is an unfriendly act towards Japan, no different than "pointing a gun at its neighbor's door." Naval experts also say that establishing naval bases far from the mainland is intended to attack Japan from nearby. (Associated Press, 19th)

(Tokyo) Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesman for the Navy Ministry, stated today at a weekly press conference in response to a question from a foreign journalist about the US fortification of Guam, that Guam is very far from the US but very close to Japan's mandated islands in the South Pacific. The islands under Japanese mandate are surrounded by US territories, such as Hawaii, Midway, Guam, and the Philippines. If Guam is fortified, Japan will not be able to defend its undefended mandated islands in the South Pacific. Japanese naval policy is based on the principles of non-threat and non-aggression, so it must pay serious attention to this situation. Japan aims to have a fleet that can adequately defend the Western Pacific, but it is hardly sufficient to take offensive action. The spokesman also stated that it should be very clear, even to the average person, that the Japanese Navy cannot engage in any long-distance transoceanic warfare. Although rumors abound, Japan will never be able to build a great navy overnight for the purpose of crossing the ocean and fighting. Rear Admiral Kanazawa concluded by saying that he did not understand the policy of the US naval authorities to plan to establish air and submarine bases on Guam as a forward station for transoceanic warfare. Japan has no unfriendly sentiments towards the US, and it seems unlikely that the US would plan to treat Japan in an unfriendly manner. However, if the US does fortify Guam, Japan will not be able to defend its mandated islands in the South Pacific, so this type of action is not only unfriendly but also a very serious threat to Japan. (Reuters, 19th)

(Washington) Republican Senator Borah stated that the US does not intend to strengthen the defenses of Guam for the time being and make it a naval base. (Reuters, 19th)

(Washington) Representative Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, stated that he supports the Navy Department's proposal to strengthen the defense of Guam, located among the islands under Japanese mandate, making it an impregnable air and naval base. According to information revealed by Vinson, his recently proposed naval bill allocates $5,000,000 to begin the work of defending Guam. Vinson said, "I personally strongly support defending Guam, but I don't know what the Bureau of the Budget will do with the $5,000,000 appropriation." President Roosevelt warned Washington reporters today that it would be best to wait for naval experts to make a formal request for funding before talking about defending Guam. State Department officials and members of Congress criticized the proposal to defend Guam, taking the position that it would not harm Guam. Army Air Corps Captain Arnold told the House Military Affairs Committee yesterday that for the US to make proper defenses, it would need to build new air bases in Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii. Two new bases would also be needed on the American continent. He said that building these five bases, preparing 3,000 new aircraft, and increasing the training of a large number of personnel were all urgent matters. Other military officials warned the Congressional committee that an indestructible line of defense should be built on the Panama Canal to ensure that the American fleet could move freely on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts in the event of war. (Associated Press, 19th)

### US Congress Discussing National Defense Plan; General Arnold Explains the Necessity of Strengthening the Air Force.

(Washington) The first of President Roosevelt's fourteen massive armament plans was submitted to the Congressional Military Affairs Committee for discussion yesterday. The plan recommends increasing the US Air Force to 6,000 first-line aircraft and 51,000 Air Force personnel, and also stipulates an outline for improving the US aircraft industry. (Haitong, 19th)

(Washington) Democratic Congressman General Arnold, the current head of the Army Air Corps, stated today that the US should build four new air bases in the next two years to complete the defense of the American continent: one in Puerto Rico, one in Alaska, and two on the American continent. The air base in Hawaii should be expanded. Arnold emphasized the importance of increasing the nation's large-scale aircraft manufacturing capacity and specifically proposed that Congress should approve the abandonment of competitive bidding for private aircraft manufacturing so that the aircraft manufacturing industry could start manufacturing as quickly as possible and increase the number of aircraft by at least 3,000, as requested by President Roosevelt. They would abandon competitive bidding in an emergency. He meant that we are now facing an emergency, and Congress should change the law. (Reuters, 19th)

### US Government Reduces Silver Price; Production Decreased Last Year.

(Washington) According to a government announcement today, the total amount of silver produced in the United States in 1938 was 61,560,000 ounces, worth $39,796,000. Compared to the production in 1937, last year's production decreased by 15%. In terms of value, it decreased by 29% compared to 1937, because the government's silver price in 1938 was 64.64 cents, while in 1937 it was 77.3 cents. (Associated Press, 18th)

### Germany and Hungary Strengthen Relations; Hungarian Foreign Minister to Visit Berlin to Discuss Economic Cooperation Between the Two Countries.

(Berlin) When Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky repaid his visit to Germany, he consulted with German leaders on everything. Now that things have been accomplished, the German government has issued a communique stating that the talks between the Hungarian Foreign Minister and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have shown that the two countries' foreign policies are completely consistent. The friendship between the two countries will be even deeper in the future. The close unity between Germany and Hungary is the best guarantee for the continued development of appeasement efforts in Europe, just like the close relationship between Hungary and Italy. (Reuters, 19th)

(Berlin) According to reports here last night, German officials are very satisfied with the results of the German-Hungarian talks conducted during the Hungarian Foreign Minister's visit to Berlin. Although the details are not yet known, it is understood from reliable sources that Csáky informed the German government that Hungary would soon decide to withdraw from the League of Nations. At the same time, there will be a new agreement regarding the status of the German minority in Hungary. The Hungarian government will pass laws based on this agreement to protect the political, cultural, and economic rights of the 600,000 German minorities. It is even possible that the German ethnic group will have representation in the Hungarian government. (Haitong, 19th)

Prague. The Czech Foreign Minister is scheduled to visit Berlin on the 21st of this month to repay a visit.

(Xi'an) King of the Shara Banner (Ikh Zhao League) and his entourage, numbering over thirty, traveled south a month ago, passing through Yulin and other places, and arrived in Xi'an by car at 2 p.m. on the 19th.

### Salt Stored on the Zhejiang Coast Is Transported Inland in Its Entirety.

(Nanchang) Since the War of Resistance, the important salt-producing areas of the Chinese coast have largely lost their effectiveness. Only the Zhejiang area is still able to produce salt. However, because the salt fields are mostly close to the battle lines, Japanese warships harass them from time to time. Furthermore, it is inconvenient to transport the salt inland, and it is inherently difficult to sell it abroad. Normally, the salt produced in the Zhejiang area is only used to supply the food needs of the province. Now, after several months of effort, the Zhejiang Transportation Office has transported all the salt stored in the coastal fields to the interior, not only maintaining the food supply for the people of Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, but also increasing the national treasury's revenue by 30 million yuan.

### Han Guojun Asks the Executive Yuan to Allocate Funds for River Dredging.

Huaiyin. Officials and gentry of Jiangsu Province have repeatedly telegraphed the Central Government, requesting that the Yellow River breach be blocked. Subsequently, they received a telegram from the Executive Yuan stating that the breach could not be blocked and the river water would not recede, and that the ten counties of Gaobao would become a swamp. A committee was specially formed to dredge the waterway to the sea, and Han Guojun was appointed as the chairman. He is now actively proceeding with the work. The total estimated cost of the project is about one million yuan. Because the people of the province are impoverished and unable to raise this large sum, Han has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, earnestly requesting an allocation of funds to complete the great work.

### Guangdong Guerrillas Threaten the Japanese Army; The Japanese Army Vigorously Retracts Its Defense Line on the East River; The Main Force Is Stationed in Dongguan to Protect Humen.

Hong Kong Correspondence: The war in Guangdong Province has recently become a seesaw battle. From the perspective of the overall situation, the Japanese army is in a passive position. Although it occupies the Guangzhou area, it is being attacked everywhere. Where the military strength is weak, it cannot defend against the guerrilla warfare of the Chinese army units. Where the troops are concentrated, it must defend against air raids by the Chinese Air Force. Therefore, the Japanese army stationed in various districts has been constantly transferred. Even the transportation of military supplies is done using auxiliary vehicles. Often, when transporting ammunition, the boxes are filled with broken bricks and tiles to deceive and confuse and prevent guerrilla teams from intercepting them, a cunning plan. As for the Japanese warships blockading the coast, they are also frequently transferred or have their numbers repainted to confuse the Chinese army. As for the Japanese steamers sailing into the inland rivers, when they forcibly enter, the first few ships have no soldiers, only a driver is responsible for driving. The soldiers on the side of the ship are mostly disguised or planted with plastic human figures to make the Chinese army mistake them for living people and shoot at them. The above points demonstrate the emptiness and cowardice of the Japanese army. Conversely, after withdrawing from Guangzhou, the Chinese army gathered in advantageous areas, waited at ease, and took the opportunity to attack. It first used guerrilla teams for large-scale active warfare, and it has recently been successful. It is said that the guerrillas in the East River area are the most active. The recent abandonment of Huizhou, Boluo, and Zengcheng by the Japanese army was due to the pressure from the guerrillas in the Luofu Mountain area and the fear that the battle line was too long and that the rear would be cut off. Therefore, the Japanese army in Huizhou, Boluo, and Zengcheng gradually retreated to the line west of the Kowloon Railway, one way to defend the city of Dongguan to protect Humen, and the other way to defend the south of Zengcheng, forming a mutual defense with the Japanese army in Conghua and Huaxian. At the same time, they increased troops in Shilong and Shitan to resist the Chinese army on the east road from driving straight down to Humen and attacking Guangzhou. They also increased troops to more than 5,000 people in Shitan, Xintang, and Nangang (all stations on the Chinese section of the Kowloon Railway) below Shilong. They further tightened the construction of defensive fortifications below Shitan. The headquarters of the Japanese army on the east road is reportedly located in Nangang. From Guangzhou Dasha Tou Station to Shitan Station, the Japanese army uses the military train to transport troops, and their activities are frequent. At the moment, the Chinese army on the east road is waiting for the northern road in Conghua to succeed before launching a large-scale attack on Shilong, attacking Shitan, and also attacking the back of the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou from Conghua along the Guang Fan Hua Road. Then, the Japanese army along the Kowloon Railway will not be difficult to cut off and solve in segments.

The Japanese army is also aware of the tense situation east of Guangzhou. On the one hand, it is shortening the defense line step by step. On the other hand, it is stationing its main force in the city of Dongguan to check the Dongguan-Taiping Highway and prepare to cover the Japanese when they retreat and escape from Humen and board ships. In early this month, the Japanese army regarded Humen as an important stronghold and sent a team to search for weapons in Shiqiao and Shawan, which are outside the defense of Humen. They were severely attacked by the local self-defense forces. However, the Japanese army still did not hesitate to use the force of a lion fighting a rabbit and used the air force to bomb. As a result, hundreds of houses were destroyed and hundreds of innocent people were killed in Shawan and Shiqiao. At that time, the self-defense forces dispersed, and the Japanese army could not pursue them, only looting civilian property. Shiqiao and Shawan are not important areas, but the Japanese army is eager to invade them to prevent the guerrillas in the two places from raiding Humen and had to send a large army to their location to implement their plan of preemptive action.

### Chinese Army in Taihu Lake Makes a Surprise Attack on Puppet Troops; Puppet Squad Leader Is Killed.

Suzhou Correspondence: On the night of the 15th, 60 or 70 guerrillas arrived at Xiangshan Zui Town on the west bank of Taihu Lake and attacked the 7th Company of the 3rd Garrison Brigade of puppet troops stationed there. The puppet captain Song Junlong fought in a panic in the dark. When the battle lasted until dawn, the Chinese army retreated to Taihu Lake after completing its mission. In this battle, the puppet squad leader Xu Chunfa and more than ten puppet soldiers, including Wu Jixiang, were killed. The puppet army lost one machine gun and many rifles. The puppet captain Song Junlong was also seriously wounded by bullets. The Japanese army stationed in Suzhou is currently transferring troops to assist.

### Wuhu Under the Iron Heel of the Japanese Army: Major and Minor Traitors Rely on Their Power and Run Rampant; Unharmed Houses Are All Occupied; Chinese Troops Control Areas Outside the City

Wuhu Correspondence: Wuhu is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River, upstream from Nanjing, and is the only major commercial port in Anhui Province. Major local products from southern and central Anhui, such as rice, tea, silk, and eggs, are all exported from here, and imported goods such as silk, satin, oil, sugar, and foreign goods are also transferred to the interior from here. The city is prosperous, with a population of about 200,000. Important main roads in the city, such as Zhongshan Road, Beiping Road, Erjie, and Siming Road, have all been widened and rebuilt, and have become modern roads. There are highways such as the Jingwu Line (from Nanjing to Wuhu) and the Wutun Line (from Wuhu to Tunxi), the Wuwei Line (from Wuhu across the river to Wuwei County), and railways such as the Jingsun Line of the Jiangnan Railway (from Nanjing to Sunjia in Xuancheng) and the Yuhe Line of the Huainan Railway (from Yuhan across the river from Wuhu to Taifei). Various shipping companies on the Yangtze River have set up lighter wharves and warehouses in Wuhu, and water and land transportation is very convenient. At the beginning of the August 13th Resistance War, a large number of people from along the Nanjing-Shanghai line fled to Wuhu, so before the city fell, the population increased and the market was prosperous. When Guangde fell and Yicheng was suddenly bombed, the people of Wuhu were greatly panicked. Then Wuhu was also bombed, and the people fled in all directions, the situation was extremely tragic. The Administrative Commissioner's Office withdrew to Wuwei County. Soon after, the vanguard of the Japanese army, from Gaochun in Jiangsu, via Shuiyang and Wuxi (under the jurisdiction of Dangtu County), arrived in Wuhu and carried out large-scale arson, looting, rape, and murder, with endless cruel acts. Later, under the instigation of the Japanese army's pacification team, corrupt officials, corrupt bureaucrats, treacherous merchants, local bullies, and vagrants established the so-called "Autonomous Committee." The puppet chairman was Zhu Xiufeng, and the puppet members were Zai Mengshou, Yu Shuoping, Xie Xuelin, Zai Zidong, Wang Xiaofu, Wang Shancheng, Wei Minqiang, Song Jiemei, Li Huinong, etc. These puppet members, seeing that the local area was scarred and the population was sparse, with nothing to do, pleaded with the Japanese side for permission to confiscate all the salt stored in the salt merchants' warehouses, the rice stored in the local granaries, and the goods from the unguarded shops in the whole port, as well as the clothes stolen by the poor, etc., and sell them collectively. The organization for selling stolen goods was euphemistically called a cooperative, headed by Zai Shancheng. Because Wang's younger brother, Zidong, had studied in Japan and was familiar with Japanese, he was able to get close to the Japanese side. The proceeds from the sale of stolen goods, in addition to most of them being reported to the Japanese side, were divided among the puppets. Although Zhu Xiufeng, as the puppet chairman, had no actual power, the remaining puppets had internal strife due to conflicts of interest, which led to Wang Xiaofu, Wei Minqiang, and Song Jiemei being detained and dismissed by the Japanese side one after another. At the same time, local thugs such as Ren Fengchang, who practiced boxing and performed arts, Tao Xifen, a former employee of the Japanese Consulate in Wuhu, and Peng Yangwu, who had been an interpreter at a Japanese hospital, were all employed by the Japanese army, held puppet positions, and relied on their power to run rampant. At present, the order in the city is extremely chaotic, because the Japanese army has no discipline, breaking into people's homes to molest women, demanding items, etc., has become commonplace, so nine out of ten residential areas in the city are empty, and no one dares to live there. The houses along Zhongshan Road are mostly occupied by the Japanese to open shops. The types of businesses, in addition to cotton yarn, tobacco, groceries, and sugar, also include many brothels and restaurants. Each Japanese merchant also sells drugs, so the atmosphere of drugs is everywhere, and more and more civilians are addicted. In addition to Japanese businesses, most are peddlers. Formal shops are one in a hundred. All the houses in the port, except for those that have been destroyed, the better and larger houses, whether public or private or agency residences, are occupied by the Japanese army or the Japanese. The owners not only cannot recover them, but are not even allowed to inspect them inside the houses. Japanese military vehicles in the streets and markets crash and speed at extremely high speeds, and the number of wronged souls under the wheels is unknown. Although the Japanese army occupies Wuhu, it can only be stationed in the city, and five miles outside the city is completely under the control of guerrillas. The Japanese army stationed in Wuhu had previously attempted to establish contact with the Japanese army in Wanzhi, 20 kilometers away from Wuhu, but failed due to interception by the New Fourth Army and other guerrillas. The Wuhu County Government is now located in a certain place in the southeastern township of the county, and the administrative system has not been interrupted. The puppet Autonomous Committee has now been reorganized into a puppet "County Public Office," still headed by Zhu Xiufeng as the puppet county magistrate, and Zai Mengshou, Yu Shuoping, and Bao Guangqing as puppet section chiefs, who took office shamelessly on New Year's Day. It is said that they are planning to levy various harsh taxes and levies to fund the puppet government. The people, under the double oppression of the Japanese army and the Chinese traitors, are all complaining bitterly.

### Japanese Troops in Jiangyin Stationed in Various Townships; Puppet County Office Attempts to Collect Land Tax; Civilian Houses Outside the City Are Demolished

Jiangyin Correspondence: After the establishment of the Cheng County puppet government, the major and minor puppets, seeing that the expenses were quite large, pleaded with the Japanese army to be stationed in the townships and towns, block the ports, and oppress the peasants, in order to collect land tax for relief. At present, there are Japanese troops stationed in various townships and towns, such as Qiaoqi, Beiguo, Nanguo, Qingyang, Nanzha, Lujiaqiao, Hucaogang, Zhangjiagang, and Shiyiwu Port, with twenty or thirty soldiers in each place. These Japanese troops go to nearby villages every day to search for chickens, pigs, eggs, and beef. If there are young women, they even want to rape them, changing from the kind of gentle policy and small favors they had a few months ago to a hideous face. In the areas occupied by the Japanese army, sentries are stationed on all transportation routes by water and land. People passing by, if they forget to bow, are slapped and kicked, or even stabbed and shot, and may lose their lives at any moment. Moreover, people are forced by life to engage in small businesses, and even a piece of firewood or a grain of rice passing through the towns and townships where the Japanese troops are stationed is forcibly extorted. If they are slightly dissatisfied, danger will come immediately, so people regard walking as a fearful journey. The guerrillas are all outside the southeast gates of the city, which the Japanese hate very much. A few days ago, they ordered the puppet county government to demolish all the civilian houses near the city outside the south gate, fearing that the guerrillas would hide there and be detrimental to the Japanese troops in the city. Even the Shui Guan fence wood was newly made, and the gate was lowered every night, showing a ridiculous state of fear.

### Chickenpox Rampant This Year: The Issue of "Hair-inducing Foods"

— You Xuezhou

Regardless of the type of rash-related illness, when the rash is about to erupt or is not fully erupted, one always feels epigastric fullness, restlessness, and an indescribable feeling. Once it has fully erupted, one feels slightly better, and only when it is completely erupted does one feel comfortable. Therefore, when encountering rash-related illnesses such as chickenpox, measles, varicella, scarlet fever, etc., the main task is to promote eruption. In the case of chickenpox, there is a custom of eating "hair-inducing foods," the purpose of which is to promote rapid eruption. However, the eruptive methods of food and medicine are very different in their effects. The current outbreak of chickenpox seems unsuitable for the "hair-inducing foods" approach, so I am pointing this out specifically.

"Hair-inducing foods" are divided into meat and vegetarian categories. In the case of chickenpox, vegetarian foods are used when the spots appear, and meat foods are used when the blisters are forming. Vegetarian "hair-inducing foods" include winter bamboo shoots, bamboo shoot tips, shiitake mushrooms, and straw mushrooms. The principle of vegetarian "hair-inducing foods" is not very clear. It is generally believed that their fresh flavor promotes certain secretions and activities, causing the rash to increase. As for the blister fluid, it is entirely brewed from qi and blood. Therefore, when qi and blood are abundant, the fluid is sufficient; when qi and blood are weak, the fluid is thin. Chicken soup and similar foods have a nourishing effect, which can increase qi and blood.

The current outbreak of chickenpox is characterized by its violent nature and its symptoms as being substantial. Clearing heat and detoxifying is the main task. When the spots appear, hair-inducing foods should not be used. If the spots are already densely distributed without gaps, adding hair-inducing foods would be like adding fuel to the fire. When doctors use ingredients such as schizonepeta, cimicifuga, and peucedanum at this time, it is not solely for the purpose of promoting eruption. Rather, the medicinal properties contain clearing and detoxifying components, which are different from winter bamboo shoots and bamboo shoot tips and cannot be equated. In my experience, when the blisters are forming in chickenpox, they often appear scorched and purplish. The insufficient fluid is caused by internal heat and stagnation. Qi and blood deficiency is rarely seen. If clearing and detoxifying are not enough, how dare we tell patients to drink chicken soup or mutton soup? Even if a patient asks about eating hair-inducing foods, I would definitely refuse to prevent any complications. If the condition is qi and blood deficiency and the fluid is clear rather than turbid, then "meat-based hair-inducing foods" may be given. Patients should pay close attention to this!

### Treatment of Insomnia

— Ye Jinqiu

Speaking of insomnia, it is really very painful. Those who have not experienced it simply cannot imagine it. "He seeks her sleeping and waking; he tosses and turns." This is because of longing, which leads to neglecting sleep and food. This type of insomnia will eventually be compensated with a sweet state. Moreover, insomnia caused by something one is thinking about is not as embarrassing. Only the insomnia of neurasthenia, that kind of dispirited state, is truly the most painful thing in the world. Neurasthenia is a modern disease of the times. Those who truly want to cultivate themselves should return to their true nature and quickly leave the city. Because the stimulation of sound and light, the dazzling colors, the temptations of lasciviousness, and the pressure of life, even the young and strong will inevitably suffer from dizziness, blurred vision, and unclear hearing.

Insomniacs with neurasthenia are mostly those who overuse their brains. Its manifestation is that the more it gets to the evening, the more energetic they become. Once they undress and go to bed, all kinds of miscellaneous thoughts will immediately come to mind. The more they try to quiet their minds, the more impossible it becomes. Then, they count their own breaths, but soon start to daydream, like a wild horse that cannot be restrained. Listening to the ticking of the clock pendulum makes them even more irritable and unable to rest. One moment their mouth is dry, the next moment they urinate. It is not until dawn, when they are extremely exhausted, that they can close their eyes and fall into a dazed, hazy sleep. After getting up, they are listless, reluctant to speak, hate hearing noises, and are easily angered. I have been through this myself, so I am very clear about this situation.

There are many causes of insomnia. The prescriptions of our country are not as consistent as those of specific tranquilizers, and there are different established methods. Regarding this, I would like to write another article. What I want to introduce now is an effective prescription for neurasthenic insomnia, which is relatively more common. This prescription has a great origin and a long history. It is Huanglian Agiao Jizihuang Tang (Coptis, Donkey-hide Gelatin and Egg Yolk Decoction) from Zhang Zhongjing of the Han Dynasty. The medicine uses coptis, scutellaria, white peony, donkey-hide gelatin, and egg yolk. It contains a lot of gelatin. Using gelatinous medicine to treat neurasthenia is definitely appropriate. People with the same disease, please try it!

### How to Adjust Diet Based on Hot and Cold Body Types

— Yan Cangshan

People's physical constitutions are different, and can be roughly divided into two types: hot and cold. If one does not have medical knowledge and indulges in food according to personal preferences, it often leads to an imbalance of hot and cold, causing illness unknowingly. I will explain them separately below:

(1) How to distinguish a hot body type and what foods to avoid: Those who are naturally prone to heat will often have constipation, yellow urine, a preference for fruits and tea, are not very afraid of the cold in winter, have a stronger pulse than average, and are prone to toothache, eye pain, throat swelling, sore throat, hemorrhoids, blood in the stool, oily ears, heat boils, dizziness, facial flushing, teeth grinding during sleep, hives, nocturnal emissions, insomnia, and red phlegm. In women, they often suffer from leukorrhea and metrorrhagia. Seeing one or two of these symptoms indicates a heat condition, and it is not necessary to see all of them. They should avoid eating a lot of chili peppers, fried foods, fragrant and dry foods, mutton, sorghum wine, and various wild game. Simple tonics such as longan, red dates, lychee, deer antler glue, tiger bone glue, and Biezhicang ginseng are also forbidden.

(2) How to distinguish a cold body type and what foods to avoid: Those who are naturally prone to cold will often have loose stools, clear and long urine, no thirst, abdominal pain or vomiting of clear water when eating raw or cold foods, cough with a lot of phlegm and shortness of breath in winter, a white and slippery tongue coating, a slower pulse than average and weak to the touch, and spontaneous sweating when moving. Even in summer, they dislike fans. These are all signs of visceral cold and dampness. They should avoid eating a lot of gypsum tofu, jellyfish skin, ark shells, crabs, oyster meat, soft-shelled turtles, eels, carp, cabbage, fresh radish, tea beans, fruits, yellow wine, and other cold foods. Simple tonics such as bird's nest, white fungus, turtle glue, donkey-hide gelatin, and American ginseng are also inappropriate.

If there are no signs above, it means that the person is normal and can eat anything without restriction. As for Hunan, Shandong, Sichuan, and Fujian, people are naturally fond of spicy food, which is due to local customs. These should be discussed separately.

### Hoarseness After a Cold

— Zhang Zanchen

After a cold, the voice is hoarse and not clear. The reason is that the cold has not cleared, and the pathogenic heat lingers in the trachea, causing the lesion to spread to the larynx and vocal cords, causing inflammation. Therefore, although the cough has healed, the hoarseness is not easy to recover for a while. The treatment method is to use one or two egg whites, add a few scallions (including the white part), fry them together, and mix in a little maltose to take. The voice will gradually become clear. The nature of egg white is sweet and fishy, slightly cold and non-toxic. It can enter the lung meridian and treat swelling and pain of the throat and hoarseness. The Treatise on Cold Damage discusses sores in the throat and inability to make a sound, which is also the Jibaikejiu Fang (Egg White and Bitter Wine Decoction), which eliminates swelling and pain and produces sound. Adding maltose can quench thirst and moisten the lungs, and adding scallions can unblock the yang qi. The combination of the three can effectively eliminate inflammation and unblock congestion, and the vocal cords are moistened, so they can restore their original clarity. Moreover, the three items are daily food and ingredients, which seem insignificant, but taking them when one loses their voice has a special effect.

### Magic Congee for Dispelling Colds

— Sun Zonghai

Since the beginning of winter, the weather has been very cold, and it is easy to suffer from colds and flu. This is because most of the houses and offices on the island are equipped with water radiators or stoves, which are as warm as spring. The climate indoors and outdoors is very different, and if you are not careful, you will easily suffer from this disease. Moreover, the houses on the isolated island are as narrow as pigeon lofts, and most families gather together. If one person gets sick, the whole family is infected, and both spirit and economy suffer. Now there is magic congee, which specializes in treating colds, flu, headaches, bone pain, and various epidemic diseases. The cooking method is simple and everyone can eat it. When you first get sick, taking this will solve it. Use half a cup of glutinous rice, five large slices of ginger, and two bowls of clear water, and boil them in a casserole for one or two rolls. Then add five or seven scallions with the roots, cook until the rice is cooked, then add a little pepper and mix well. Eat the congee while it is hot, or just eat the congee soup, and sleep in a windless place to sweat. This uses glutinous rice to support the righteousness as the monarch, and ginger and scallions to dispel as assistants, one to replenish and one to dispel, and also uses pepper to penetrate, which is very meaningful; and it has been repeatedly tested, which is by no means comparable to ordinary releasing agents. It is called magic congee, who says it is not appropriate?

### Cockle Shells

— Zhang HuaiLin

"Cockle shells" are commonly known as Ma Hanqian, and those produced in Ningbo are the best. There are two types: the larger one is called Ma Han; the smaller one is called Ning Han. From autumn to spring, they are sold in the market. They are slightly cold in nature, and people with cold bodies should not eat them. People with weak digestive power should not eat them. However, they can calm the liver and nourish the blood, and are a food for women to soothe and nourish the liver. The meat is eaten during meals, and the shell is used for medicine and decocted after calcination. It is most suitable for people with yin deficiency and liver hyperactivity, who often have dizziness and tinnitus. Cockle shells nourish yin and blood. For those with liver yang exuberance, this thing can both subdue liver yang and nourish blood, which is very suitable.

Also, cockle shells are cold in nature, and people with deficiency and cold should not eat them. Eating them often causes abdominal pain, which is a sign of coldness. Women should also avoid eating them during menstruation.

Ginseng, Velvet Antler, and White Fungus

### Bird's Nest (II)

— Cao Bingzhang

Origin: Natural bird's nests are produced on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia. The Book of Yi states that on the coast, the rocky cliffs have many caves. Thousands of seabirds nest in the caves. There are no fewer than dozens of places such as Bantam, Batavia, Sambolong, Jielishi, Nanwang, Marcin, and Maoli Ba. They are all controlled by powerful Dutch people. Natural bird's nests are built on cliffs and precipices overseas, such as Siamese bird's nests and hairy bird's nests. Recently, in Java and other places in Southeast Asia, it is difficult to collect natural nests, so they have built houses to cultivate nesting, such as Dragon Tooth bird's nests and Dazhi bird's nests. Their color is white, tender, and loose in texture, because they are not exposed to sunlight. Borneo produces the most. Later, they were imported into our country from this place. According to statistics ten years ago, the annual import value was as much as 3.5 million taels of silver.

Morphology: The swiftlet is as big as a nightjar, shaped like a swallow, and smaller than an ordinary swallow. This is the morphology of the swiftlet. The bird's nest is the nest built by its saliva.

Efficacy: It is sweet, neutral, and non-toxic in taste. (Feng Yuan) It is sweet, bland, and neutral, greatly nourishes lung yin, resolves phlegm, stops cough, replenishes and clears, and is the holy medicine for treating deficiency and consumption. All diseases due to lung deficiency and inability to clear and descend can be treated with this. It opens the stomach qi, stops dysentery, benefits children's measles and varicella, can be added to decoctions, or taken alone in juice. (Tea Talk) It can stop frequent urination. (Physical Knowledge) It strengthens yang, benefits qi, harmonizes the middle, opens the stomach, adds essence, replenishes marrow, moistens the lungs, and stops chronic malaria, chronic diarrhea, and resolves consumptive phlegm. (Food Taboos) Red ones treat bloody dysentery. (Lingnan Miscellany) Remove the core of a white pear and put in one qian of bird's nest, first soak it in boiling water, then add one qian of rock sugar, steam it until cooked, and take it every morning without interruption. It has a miraculous effect in treating phlegm and asthma in the elderly. (Wentang Qi Yan Fang) Two qian of white bird's nest and four fen of ginseng, add ten parts of water, stew in a double boiler until cooked. Eat it slowly to treat anorexia with dysentery with immediate effect. (Saving the Suffering Seas) Two qian of bird's nest and one and a half qian of rock sugar, eat immediately. It treats malaria in the elderly and infantile malaria and fetal heat in children with prolonged malaria. (Trial Prescription) Persistent vomiting and anorexia, take it with milk and eat bird's nest to recover. (Wentang Collection of Prescriptions) Two qian of bird's nest and one and a half qian of raw astragalus, decoct into a thick juice and take it to treat insufficient qi and fluid in children and sunken pox. (Experience Prescription) Sudden cough, vomiting blood, take white bird's nest and rock sugar and cook together, take it continuously, take its mild tonifying lung and stomach, and there is no harm in stopping the problem, but those who have phlegm and dampness in the stomach, make people want to vomit, because of its sweetness and greasiness. (Feng Yuan) (The End)

### Changes in the Condition of Typhoid Fever and Dietary Regimen (Continued and Completed)

— Chen Cunren

(C) Third Stage Symptoms: Alternating chills and fever do not subside, and the high and low temperatures seem to be regular. The temperature is in the range of 102-103 degrees Fahrenheit, the ears gradually become deaf, the eyes are slightly red, the mouth is slightly bitter, the throat is slightly dry, the eyes are slightly dizzy, there is discomfort in the chest and hypochondria, silence, disinclination to eat, restlessness.

In this period, in addition to the changes in the previous period, the symptoms are more common, but the prolonged alternating chills and fever make people anxious and uneasy. Seeing this phenomenon in typhoid fever, one must know that the disease will be prolonged. The diseases in the second and third stages of typhoid fever often occur in combination, and it is better if there is no loss of consciousness or fainting.

(D) Fourth Stage Symptoms: At this time, one gradually enters the state of decline, and the alternating chills and fever are still unresolved, with loose stools and diarrhea, abdominal fullness and vomiting, and hidden abdominal pain. This kind of phenomenon obviously shows that the physical strength is insufficient. It is also the commonly known "leaking the bottom of the bucket" typhoid fever.

(E) Fifth Stage Symptoms: The physical strength is extremely insufficient, drowsy, and only wants to sleep, the hands and feet are not very warm, the breath is exhaled from the mouth, and there is also diarrhea. At this time, if the diarrhea stops and the hands and feet warm, it is a good sign. Curled up and restless, wanting to take off the clothes, is also still curable. Sweating and dizziness are not good, and bleeding from diarrhea is likely to lead to death.

(F) Sixth Stage Symptoms: This is also the most terrible phenomenon, the tongue curls inward and is shorter than usual, the testicles and scrotum shrink and disappear, fainting, restlessness, vomiting and hiccups, even vomiting of roundworms, cold limbs, pale complexion, loose stools or hard stools that are black.

The changes in the condition of typhoid fever seem to have a certain process, as described above. If the treatment is appropriate, the disease often passes through one or two stages to three or four stages and is suddenly cured. The symptoms of stages five and six are rarely seen, so the mortality rate is less than 10%. The important thing is for the family to know the condition, resist for a long time, and not change the doctor's treatment plan early in the morning. The so-called "belief is power," and one must not doubt their physical strength or worry endlessly. The so-called "self-confidence can survive." Typhoid fever is often eliminated naturally through "long-term resistance." Therefore, "the final victory must belong to me." Even if the disease has become bone thin, but as long as the diet is properly nourished, it can easily change from thin to fat, and the physical strength is doubled compared to the past. Is it similar to the medical country doctor?

### The Issue of Dietary Restrictions

— Qin Bingyi

National medicine has the theory of dietary restrictions. Because of this, gluttons think it is an unpleasant talk. One must know that dietary restrictions and diseases are indeed closely related. This journal advocates dietary therapy, and I am deeply sorry for the neglect of dietary restrictions by patients. Please allow me to discuss it in detail for everyone:

Food enters the mouth and all goes to Xiao. The stomach exercises its power to transform things, separating the dregs and taking the essence to nourish the blood vessels and replenish the internal organs. The stomach acts like this: how important is the relationship between food and the human body? It is natural for normal people, let alone patients? Furthermore, pure water changes quickly according to what is mixed with it. How can the response of food to the stomach and to the human body be outside of this? But ordinary people have strong digestive power, which does not cause drastic changes quickly. However, in the case of patients, things quickly become unmanageable! This is why dietary restrictions cannot be ignored. In general, external diseases require complete dietary restrictions, and even grains cannot be taken lightly; because grains help the stomach qi, and the external pathogenic heat is strong, more grains are easily attached, and the heat does not subside. As evidence, in the case of cholera after recovery, one must fast. As for internal injuries, the scope is wider: heart disease avoids roasted and spicy foods, liver disease avoids glutinous rice noodles and greasy foods, spleen disease avoids sticky and thick foods, lung disease avoids tobacco, alcohol, and stimulants, and kidney disease avoids shrimp, crabs, and irritating foods. These are obvious and more important. In addition, we must also pay attention to carbuncles, sores, and large illnesses that have not yet recovered. Otherwise, mild illnesses turn into serious illnesses, and serious illnesses turn into danger, which is inevitable and reasonable. In short, the matter of dietary restrictions, in the positive aspect, is to help the progress of medicine, and in the negative aspect, it is to prevent the expansion of the lesion. I hope the readers will examine it.

### School Overview: The Downtown Business School of Shanghai University

The private Downtown Business School of Shanghai University, located at 209 Yuanmingyuan Road, Shanghai, was established in the spring of the 21st year of the Republic [1932].

There were more than 200 students. Since then, it has gradually developed to what it is today, spanning seven years. Initially, it was planned to be named the Night University. Later, because its main purpose was to promote work-study programs, study business, and cultivate business talents, it was named the Downtown Business School of Shanghai University.

### Li Huitang Agrees to Come North; Other Famous Hong Kong Players Will Come to Shanghai Together; Zhou Shoushen's Reply Arrives in Shanghai; Hong Kong Public Opinion Supports

For the charity football match initiated by the International Relief Committee and the Refugee Association, in order to arouse the interest of all sectors and raise more funds to relieve refugees, Li Guiyong, a member of the Standing Committee, sent a special letter to Mr. Zhou Shoushen of Hong Kong, inviting Li Huitang, the captain and king of our World Games team, to come to Shanghai to participate. The International Committee received a reply from Zhou yesterday, saying that Li is very willing to come north to serve. According to the opinions of the sports circles and people from all walks of life in this city, it is hoped that Mr. Li can fulfill his promise to come here, and it is hoped that Hong Kong can send more famous players to join the Chinese team, so that the Western team can be severely defeated at that time. As for Mr. Li's concerns about public opinion, this event is purely for the refugees, so there is naturally no problem. The original letter from Zhou to the International Committee is recorded below: Mr. Guiyong, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, Greetings. After receiving the letter sent on the 19th of last month, I immediately wrote to Mr. Li Huitang, inviting him to participate in the competition. I recently received his reply, saying that in the small team leader cup competition a few days ago, public opinion was critical at the time. His trip to Shanghai this time is similar in meaning. I don't know what public opinion is like. If the Chinese people all say it is okay to go, then he will not hesitate to go through fire and water. Now, looking at Mr. Huitang's words, his enthusiasm is overflowing. However, he is afraid that social people will misunderstand and blame him. Reading the newspapers in recent days, they all advocate his participation, which shows that public opinion is consistent. And Mr. Li has always followed public opinion as his guide, so his trip to Shanghai should be realized. However, I don't know when your committee has scheduled the charity football match, how many days the competition will last, how many days you need to stay in Shanghai, and how many players you need from Hong Kong. Please let me know the above information so that I can inform you. Zhou Shoushen bowed, etc.

### Securities: Domestic and Foreign Bonds Rise Steadily; Domestic Bonds Rise by 35 Cents; Foreign Bonds Rebound by 12 Pounds

In the securities market, yesterday's gray market situation, while relatively stable, still appeared chaotic. According to reports, the new reform measures have become clear, namely that the sixth interest payment due can be divided into six installments and paid in legal tender in Shanghai. This is a considerable improvement compared to previous rumors, but in general, those holding physical bonds are still mostly apprehensive due to a lack of understanding of the true situation and are somewhat disappointed with the reforms. However, considering the overall financial situation of the country, the sincerity in safeguarding the interests of the people is felt to be very thorough and painstaking. The market price of public bonds, although inevitably slightly affected by sales from a few skeptics, is expected to calm down soon. Yesterday, at the opening in the morning, the "46" bond was quite heavily bought, and the market price suddenly rose by 67 cents. Subsequently, Xinfeng Water again had some selling, and the downward trend and fluctuations did not stop. However, retail selling was relatively less. Afternoon trading was relatively quiet, with some retail buying, but Xie Da still had some selling. In recent days, there have been many speculative transactions on both the buying and selling sides, so market fluctuations are not natural. The afternoon results were slightly better, and after the market closed for the whole day, it had risen slightly by 35 cents to 55 cents compared to the previous day. However, the "D" bond was traded very little, down slightly by 2 cents. The total transaction volume was about 560,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing　Compared to Previous Day

Unified A　56.60　55.90　56.40　Up 0.55

Unified B　50.00　49.10　49.90　Up 0.50

Unified C　49.10　48.20　48.85　Up 0.55

Unified D　48.15　48.10　48.10　Down 0.20

Unified E　48.65　47.85　48.35　Up 0.35

96　7.00

——

7.00

Up 0.15

Stock trading was still dominated by public utility stocks. Yesterday, 300 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded at a price of 6.60 yuan, and 200 shares of China Merchants Electric were traded at a price of 4.95 yuan.

London Chinese foreign bonds on the 18th of this month (Wednesday) were listed. After two consecutive days of declines, various types of bonds have rebounded by 12 pounds or more. The Anglo-German continued loan and British bonds rose by 2 pounds, with a price of 72 pounds. The Reorganization Loan and British bonds rose by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 48 pounds. The Sino-French US dollar bonds with imprinted bonds and the Crisp bonds each rose by 1 pound, with the former priced at 67 pounds and the latter at 31 pounds. London still has supplies of the Sino-French Bonus and Reorganization British Gold bonds, but the owners are asking for very firm prices. The Sino-French US dollar bonds with imprinted bonds are priced at 68.5 pounds, 1.5 pounds above the market price. The Reorganization British Gold bonds and British bonds are priced at 48.5 pounds, half a pound above the market price. The French imprinted bonds are priced at 46 pounds and 5 shillings, 5 shillings higher than the previous day. The German imprinted bonds are priced at 44 pounds and 5 shillings, 15 shillings higher than the previous day.

Also, the stock market listing prices of various Far Eastern companies in London on the 18th of this month (Wednesday) were stable without change.

### Finance: Scarce Supply and Demand; Cash Price Remains Stable

Yesterday's gray market for cash silver ingots was stable and consistent. The quietness of trading was unprecedented this year, mainly because major players were mostly holding a wait-and-see attitude. However, the market price, amidst the quietness, had slight ups and downs, generally starting flat, then falling, and then rebounding. Initially, a certain gold firm's interest was strong, but because the supply was not scarce, the supply and demand positions were balanced, and the market situation lacked change. Then, suddenly, after hearing that foreign exchange was heavily blocked by Hong Kong telegrams, it became slightly tight, and a certain money exchange business was eager to sell, so it once broke below the 20 yuan mark. Later, due to a certain gold firm suddenly buying, coupled with the lack of supply, it rebounded above the 20 yuan mark. In the end, there was no difference, and the sentiment of all parties was still stable. Silver jewelry shops did not see any changes. Customs Gold, Fengzhong British Pure Gold, etc., fell slightly again.

Major Ingot Traders Observe and Do Not Move

From the morning, there was no trading for each bar (ten taels). It was not until 9:50 that a certain gold firm bought 50 taels each from the money exchange business and the cash firm, with an opening price of 2003 yuan (the buyer made up for what they had sold the previous day). After this, because the buyers heard that foreign exchange was slightly tight after being heavily blocked by Hong Kong telegrams, they mostly observed cautiously, making it even more difficult to trade. The price then retreated to between 20 yuan. Later, until about 10:45, because a certain money exchange business was eager to sell, it depreciated and sold 50 taels to the silver jewelry industry at a low price of 17 yuan. Later, it was extended to 11:15, and another 50 taels were sold by the money exchange business to the silver jewelry industry at a noon closing price of 19 yuan. In the afternoon, trading became even quieter. Only at 2:30, the silver jewelry industry sold 50 taels to the gold firm at a price of 22 yuan. After this, a certain firm suddenly had the intention to sell and shouted as low as 20 yuan, but it was difficult to find buyers, so no trading was done. Therefore, the evening closing price was 2022 yuan, with no difference from the previous day's evening closing price. The total range for the day was 6 yuan. The selling price of the cash firm's own gold brand was 2030 yuan, and the buying price was 2015 yuan. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading.

Silver Jewelry Still Held at Original Price

The exchange rate for silver jewelry per tael did not change. Da Tong Heng, Lao Qingyun, etc., still held the original price of 205 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng still held 203 yuan, with a buying price of 197 yuan.

British Pure Gold Continues to Shrink by One Penny

An 18th London telegram stated that British pure gold shrunk by another penny per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 7 pence and 7 and a half farthings. The central bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold ingots also decreased to 1213.3 yuan. The listed Customs Gold also decreased by 2 li, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen and 7 li. The Shanghai listed standard gold price also fell by 7 jiao, totaling 1208.6 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Trading is Low; Prices Also Gradually Decrease

Yesterday, British pure gold fell by one penny, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 0.25. The demand for foreign exchange was slightly strong, and the supply was not smooth. The process was stable, and the trend was weak. Ingot trading was not strong, major players were watching, and retail investors slightly emerged to settle. Speculators were uncertain, and the market price hovered and tended to soften. Foreign currency trading was very scarce. The demand for British gold pounds was very strong, and foreign banks collected more than 100 pounds. Dutch bills and Philippine bills were scarce on the market, and the prices were slightly higher. Other currencies showed a slight decrease. The process was calm, and the trend was slightly soft. The guild did not start trading. Yesterday's market prices: US dollar bill price was down 1 fen, Hong Kong bill was down 3 li, Singapore bill was down 1 fen, Dutch bill was up 3 fen, Philippine bill was up 2 fen, Italian bill was down 1 fen. Other currencies did not change.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Decrease Again

An 18th London telegram stated that speculators sold, there was a lack of maintenance, and trading was limited. The silver market was still flat, and after the close, it was flat and dull. Finally, there were a few transactions, and the buyers were satisfied. The near and far terms of large silver bars continued to decrease, with the near term shrinking by 0.1875 and the far term shrinking by 0.125. A New York silver telegram stated that the US silver price still had a market but no sales. Another Bombay silver telegram stated that the Indian silver market was still flat, and the spot price had not changed. Near and far terms both continued to fall by one anna.

### Spot Discount Gradually Increases

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills and notes was still gradually increasing. Initially, it was 37 yuan per thousand, and at noon, it rose slightly to 37.25 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to climb slightly to 37.75 yuan, and finally, it was 37.5 yuan, half a yuan higher than the previous day.

### Hong Kong Continuously Sells Foreign Exchange; Exchange Rate Continues to Rise, British Flat, US Loosens

Although foreign firms still have frequent settlements in the foreign exchange market yesterday, the situation is gradually stabilizing because Hong Kong telegrams continue to sell vigorously, and Chinese speculators are also emerging. However, when squeezed, the British are flat and the US loosens, which is because the British-American exchange rate is squeezed long.

In the early morning, London large bars continued to shrink near and far, and New York spot prices did not move. London raw gold fell by one penny, and the exchange rate of British to American continued to rise by 5 li 6, did not change to French, and was still flat to Shanghai. American to British rose by 0.25 again, rose by 0.375 to French, and remained the same to Shanghai. The central listing prices for various exchanges remained unchanged. Banks opened early spot selling prices: British exchange was 8 pence 296875, and American exchange was 16.1875 yuan. Compared with the previous close, British shrunk by 0.015625, and American had no ups and downs. After opening, although Datong, British, Dutch, and American banks competed to buy spot American exchange at 16.12875 yuan, and HSBC Magali purchased spot shillings at 8 pence 3125, the potential was slightly tighter because Hong Kong telegrams repeatedly exerted pressure, and Chinese banks also started selling favorable January shillings also at 8 pence 3125. HSBC's listing price was revealed and did not move. The silver balancing tax was revealed and continued to shrink by 0.125. After that, foreign firms bought HSBC Magali spot shillings at only 8 pence 28125, and also bought and settled Dutch Datong spot American exchange at only 16.1875 yuan. In addition, Huayi, Anda, and Holland competed to absorb spot Hong Kong exchange from money exchange businesses at 55.75 yuan, so the situation gradually turned flat. The noon closing prices were British gold at 8 pence 3125 and US dollars at 16.21875 yuan.

In the later market, although Huabi American Bank Datong Holland's appetite was still healthy, and they continued to buy spot shillings at 8 pence 3125 and spot American exchange at 16.21875 yuan, the situation tended to loosen because Hong Kong telegrams' selling intention never weakened. Finally, foreign firms bought spot shillings from British Bank again at 8 pence 25. In addition, the supply of funds from banks was not smooth, and the appetite was healthier. Huabi Holland bought spot Hong Kong exchange at 55.75 yuan, causing the trend to return to stability. The evening closing selling prices of banks were British exchange at 8 pence 325 and US exchange at 16.21875 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, British was flat and US rose by 0.03125. Hong Kong exchange shrank by 0.25 compared with the previous day's transaction price.

### Silver and Money Businesses Make a Fortune: Thanks to the Government and the Blessings of Clients Fleeing Disaster; It's Really a Huge Wartime Profits Tax

In 1938, HSBC Bank made a great fortune, and other banks, such as Huabi, also made a fortune. Not only did foreign banks make a fortune, but also Chinese banks, without exception. Not only did Chinese banks make a fortune, but also money shops, even the small money shops in the Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road areas, all made a fortune, some with tens of millions or hundreds of thousands of yuan, and others with tens of thousands of yuan. Bank managers and directors all laughed, while bank employees had tears and laughter, and some were unable to cry or laugh. Employees in foreign banks had monthly surpluses and could receive foreign exchange, thanks to the foreign bosses and, in fact, thanks to the government, so everyone smiled. Chinese bank employees initially used the national crisis as a pretext to lay off employees and reduce salaries, with discounts of 30% or 20%, and everyone felt pain. However, some were favored by the bank authorities and secretly received allowances. Those who ate meat ate meat, and those who ate bones ate bones. The bitterness and joy were uneven, and there were also many who were unable to cry or laugh.

Where did this rolling legal tender come from? (1) It was foreign exchange. The words "foreign exchange" were the shortcut for banks to make a fortune. As long as the statutory exchange rate and the black market exchange rate were compared, it would be clear, not to mention "getting the wind first" and buying and selling at any time. (2) Restricting withdrawals and promoting remittances, the original intention was to maintain finance, but unexpectedly, it became a way to make money. Buying and selling legal tender and discounting at exorbitant rates, the profits in this were immeasurable. (3) Real estate transactions, due to the concentration of refugees in Shanghai, suddenly became active. For example, one bank completed 6 million yuan in this transaction in one month in June, and the others can be imagined. (4) Buying and selling gold. Last year, the trend was upward, and every transaction made a profit. Just buy and just sell. In and out, a bar of gold did not talk about surplus, but only the handling fee was already more than ten yuan. (5) Those who did remittances in the north, such as Tianjin, were given a great opportunity for profit due to the difference between "counterfeit money" and legal tender. (6) Deposits increased sharply. Last year, the refugees who fled to Shanghai were mostly wealthy people from the mainland, who came with huge sums of money and all used banks as a place to store them. On the one hand, due to the sharp increase in population, the market was abnormally prosperous, and banks used this to make payments and use capital, benefiting from the situation.

So, banks and money shops made a fortune. Where did the money come from? Who did they rely on? The government's maintenance of the statutory exchange rate and the assistance of customers who came and went. How much benefit was there for the country? Only a wartime profits tax, but it needs to be fair and collected according to the amount. However, it will again use wartime losses as a trick to cover the books in order to escape it.

### Yarn and Cotton: Hoarding Intensifies; Yarn Prices Rise Again by 67 Yuan

The yarn market is increasingly firm, and the rising trend is particularly strong. Although actual demand does not have wholesale development, it is more than the previous day, and various groups show signs of activity. The Yunnan group continues to purchase, and the Jiangxi group's buying appetite is particularly strong, making the market even more upright. As for the Tonghui and hoarders, their intentions are originally to watch for higher prices. With this actual sales support, their absorption in the market is doubly strong. Therefore, the market price is moving forward vigorously. According to the reporter's repeated investigations, why is hoarding cotton yarn so enthusiastic among those who are generally economically prosperous? According to public opinion, (1) the raw materials are monopolized by a certain party, and there is no hope of a decline in the future. The raw cotton for spinning 20s yarn must be priced at 80 yuan per dan (horse scale). Three and a half dan make one package of yarn, and the cost is 280 yuan. Adding various opening fees and other miscellaneous expenses of 50 yuan, plus a unified tax of 10 yuan, the net price is a total of 340 yuan. At the current yarn price of 390 yuan, there is only a profit of more than 40 yuan. (2) The securities market is erratic. Many people who release public bonds and invest in cotton yarn. With these two major reasons, the market remains firm and does not loosen. The future is that we will continue to move forward and break through the high price of 403 yuan, still relying on sales to drive it.

Looking at the situation of the current yarn market yesterday, the market opened in the early morning due to news of activity in the demand of customer groups. The Yunnan group had a telegram to purchase goods, and the activity of hoarders became even stronger. The opening price of 20s Double Horse jumped by 8.5 yuan to 393.5 yuan. Fellow traders transacted 30 bales. Shortly after, the Shantou group also came to purchase 20 bales, adding another 0.5 yuan, and the atmosphere was tight. After the price was high, some profit-takers took advantage of the rise to sell, but major players still absorbed, and there was a slight pullback. Double Horse was transacted at 391 yuan. Then, the industry continued to buy, and the price rose again. The closing price of 10s Double Horse was 392 yuan. As a result, 1427 bales were transacted in the morning. The Double Horse price rose by 7 yuan, the Special Jincheng rose by 7 yuan, the Double Earth rose by 6 yuan, the Tiannv rose by 6 yuan, and the 10s coarse yarn rose by 3 yuan. The Yong'an Factory opened 50 bales of 20s Jincheng at a price of 397 yuan. The Hongzhang Factory opened 200 bales of 10s Shi Yi at a price of 285 yuan. The Dasheng Factory opened 100 bales of 10s Hong Kuixing, priced from 277 yuan to 275 yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that the Tongyi Factory opened 20s Jinji at 393 yuan and 10s Jinji at 302 yuan, totaling more than 200 bales, which were purchased by Yunnan. The amount purchased by each group is recorded below:

Fellow Traders　987　Jiangxi　230

Yunnan　125　Mainland　90

Fuzhou　15　Shantou　20

Total　1,427

The Japanese yarn market is following the rise of Chinese yarn, but demand is still not smooth. The ball trading this month is relatively popular. The current spot price of 20s Shuiyue yarn is 314 yuan. The price for this month is 3123 yuan. 20s Lanfeng is 311 yuan, and this month is 310 yuan to 308.5 yuan, up 2.3 yuan or more from the previous day. 42s and 32s have particularly tight momentum.

### Sales of Fine Velvet Rise Sharply; White Bales Sell at High Prices

The cotton business has become more prosperous. The Tianjin fine velvet cotton, which had been sluggish for a long time, suddenly launched yesterday. However, the amount is scarce, and it is purchased by the Hua number to offset the factory quota that has been dumped. The Japanese factory is still purchasing 700 pieces of Indian cotton, which is the raw material for 32s, at a price of only 88 yuan. China Merchants Yong'an purchased 200 pieces of bundled cotton, and Tongyi Factory purchased 1,000 bales of Yao clothing. The remaining factories are still as depressed as before. However, the industry's entry and exit are still lively, and the market is calm. There is not much difference from the previous day. Only the selling price of white bales is still outstanding. From the overall trend of the cotton market, the price has reached a point where it cannot rise any further. However, the source of the northern route has disappeared, so the purchase of American and Indian cotton by various factories in China and abroad has increased rather than decreased. There are 1,500 bales of Tonghua and fine velvet arriving at the pier, 390 pieces from Xingang, and 250 pieces from Beisha, which have not yet been opened. The current cotton transaction amount and market conditions are listed on the left:

### Difficult to Resolve American Cotton Production; Intention to Convene World Cotton Production Conference; American Cotton Market Prices Therefore Stagnate

The foreign cotton market prices, the National Assembly held in Washington and the meeting of cotton producing area congressmen held since the previous day, are particularly concerned by people in the world cotton industry. The meeting of cotton producing area congressmen is due to the severity of the cotton surplus problem, which is not easy to solve, so the meeting has been temporarily suspended since yesterday and will be continued after a few days. American Agriculture Secretary Henry Wells, seeing that the American cotton surplus problem cannot be solved by the American government alone, is now planning to try to convene an international cotton production conference of various cotton producing countries in the world to jointly discuss how to deal with this surplus of loan cotton and future cotton industry policies and other issues. Recently, cloth is still selling well, with a total of more than 6 million yards sold in the past two days, so the entry appetite of various factories has been unusually strong recently. However, the congressional discussions have not yet been resolved, and the market price is therefore very stagnant. Yesterday, New York saw mixed ups and downs. India, including forecasts, fell by half a 比, and Egypt rose by 35 pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate was firm, and the legal tender cotton prices all fell. American cotton and Brazilian cotton each fell by 0.7 yuan per dan, Egyptian fell by 0.9 yuan, and Indian cotton fell by 0.3 yuan.

The trading of foreign cotton in this city is due to the high price of fire machines and the scarcity of sources, and the amount of bales cannot be large, so various factories have been opening a lot of Pingguo'er Omarra for days. Yesterday, Shenxinfu entered 700 bales of Indian cotton Bairok, which can be spun into 32s, and the factory price was 88.25 yuan. The transaction amount is recorded below:

Shenxin　Entered Indian Cotton　700 bales

Tongxing　Also　500 bales

Gongda　Also　500 bales

Neiwai　Entered American Cotton　1,000 bales

### Piece Goods: East Piece Rising Trend Becomes More Intense; Speculation Rises Suddenly and Goods are Hoarded; Market Prices Rise Steadily and Additional Purchases Continue

National Cloth: Yesterday, the rising trend of East Pieces intensified, and the prices of Hua Factory greige also rose, affecting the cost of dyed cloth, and the selling prices were uniformly raised. The atmosphere was upward, and the demand appetite was more intense. Distant and nearby customers continued to add orders. The Ningbo group and eastern Zhejiang inland original pieces and white cloth dismantled pieces shipped out more than 500 pieces yesterday. The Ou group and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway also reached more than 400 pieces, mostly blue cloth, miscellaneous twill, and native cloth. The purchase of printed goods, bleached cloth, greige, was also large. The Sichuan-Yunnan group also made progress, purchasing more than 100 pieces of innerwear factory 9-pound coarse cloth, 84 greige, Peacock fine cloth, etc., and more than 3,000 pieces of bleached cloth, blue cloth, colored twill, poplin, and printed goods. The Haikou group entered 30 boxes of colored twill and 30 bales of fine twill. The Hong Kong group entered more than 40 bales of 12-pound three rabbit coarse twill, 16-pound coarse twill, 9-pound coarse cloth, and fine twill. The Yangkou, Shaxian, Xinghua, Quanzhou and other places in Fujian Province entered thousands of pieces of original color miscellaneous color twill serge. The Shantou group entered more than 200 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. The selling price of printed, dyed, and bleached cloth rose by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan per piece. Only 84 cloth rose by 0.1 yuan for white goods. The prices of coarse and fine cloth and coarse and fine twill are still flat, and the trend has been slightly active. White goods continue to be outstanding.

East Cloth:

Sales are becoming increasingly prosperous. Yesterday, the selling prices of fine cloth and fine twill rose steadily. For example, the closing price of fine cloth from the Dragon Head and Color Ball brands was 11.4 yuan per piece, and the market price was still 0.1 yuan higher per piece. The total number of current and futures orders for Dragon Head, Color Ball, Flying Fish, Trumpet, Double Fish, and other fine cloths was about 2,000 pieces. In addition, there were also 4500 pieces of Yanghe, Dragon Head, and Baby fine twill opened. Although this was due to the high spirits of fellow traders and their strong entry appetite, there were also some non-industry hoarders who, in view of the active trend of East Pieces and the convenience of entry and exit, were not without speculators. Therefore, in addition to the sale of futures by various foreign firms, the spot trading in the market was also very lively. The local dyeing and sales and mutual sales among fellow traders also amounted to 1,500600 pieces. The Tianjin group's entry intention was even better, and they continued to purchase more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill from various brands. The factories were tightening their prices, hoarding goods to make a profit. The original cloth of 84 Flying Fish and other brands also increased by 0.10.2 yuan yesterday. For transportation and export, 454 pieces of Chinese and foreign piece goods were transported to Tianjin yesterday.

### Food: Imported Wheat Arrives in Shanghai; Flour Becomes Mutually Exclusive; Wheat Shows Signs of Collapse

The current sales of flour decreased yesterday, and both the northern and southern groups had not yet cleared the goods they had previously purchased. Moreover, after the factory's fixed wheat arrived in Shanghai, the raw materials gradually became sufficient, and buyers were thinking of suppressing prices to purchase, while the factories were thinking of holding on to the original prices, but they were not too accommodating, resulting in mutual exclusion between the two parties. As a result, in addition to the 7,000 or more bags of No. 2 flour of various brands that were punched out at the original price by the local street, the remaining customers only had 2300 bags and 12,000 bags of scattered decorative transactions. There were rumors that the selling price of returned goods was revised downward, so the market has shown signs of secret loosening. As for the current flour export, there were 21,000 bags transported to Tianjin yesterday, and there will also be 1,000 bags transported to Tianjin and 7,000 bags transported to Yantai today.

The wheat market showed signs of collapse yesterday. The source of cartwheel wheat was about 2,000 bags each, including 1,200 bags from Xingang. The factory's orders for foreign wheat are arriving one after another. Although it still needs domestic wheat, the eating plate has been given importance. The cargo side is still struggling because of the difficulty of transportation and high costs. As a result, it has been reduced by 0.030.04 yuan. A total of 5,000 bags of Jiangbei, Puzhen, Wuhu, and other wheat were opened. Fuxin Factory purchased 3,000 bags, and Fulan Factory purchased 2,000 bags, with a highest price of 6.67 yuan. With the sound of foreign wheat arriving in Shanghai, the future of domestic wheat has been significantly affected.

### Keqian Cartwheel Arrived with a Thriving Source; Jingmi People are also Discouraged

Ke Qian: Some local customers took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the market was quite prosperous. However, cartwheel arrivals were all surging. In addition to Jingwu Zhenjiang Keqian, there were also 1,500 bags from Hupu and 3,000 bags of Taizhou Jiqian newly arrived. Therefore, the Chinese goods continued to shrink by nearly jiao, and the high-end goods also had a soft count of several fen. Nanjing high-end Keqian shouted 11 yuan, but the market only opened 10.09 yuan. Although the newly arrived Taizhou cargo products were better than the previous arrivals, the market price was only 10.03 yuan. Zhenjiang Qian was 10.08 yuan, and Wu Qian was 10.065 yuan to about 10 yuan. A total of more than 2,000 bags were transacted in the unified market.

Jingmi: The source of Heda has not arrived, but there are quite a few wheel carts and buns, totaling more than 10,000 bags. However, many of those who suffered rain damage on the way in the past two days were not few. The sellers could not help but be discouraged and all held the intention of quick release. Moreover, the street and hoarders saw that the source was slightly more, and their thoughts were also set, so the market conditions were very different from the previous market, and the situation suddenly softened. The market immediately went down. As a result, thick and thin Jingxi were all down by a small angle. Du Yangjian Pu Jian was also difficult to stand firm, falling by several fen to one jiao. Only Bian Yuan's scarce hot orders were still firm.

### Miscellaneous: Jute Bags are in Short Supply; Selling Prices are Rising Daily

The jute bags needed for sugar, rice, and miscellaneous grains in this city have always relied on imports from India. Due to the tightening of exchange rates, the source has gradually decreased. There is only one Japanese company with a relatively large scale of bag-making factories in this port, but it must supply military needs for that country. The old bags in the market have been purchased in large quantities by the Chinese and Japanese armies successively, so merchants often feel that the need is insufficient. At present, the selling price of large market goods of blue line single Mai is 750 yuan per thousand, and single Mai Chongxin needs 850 yuan per thousand, which is very different from the 4500 yuan per thousand before August 13.

### Seafood: Mingfu a Batch; Newly Purchased by Hong Kong Gang

Mingfu: Due to the lack of both arrival and storage, the way out is smooth. It is heard that a batch of fathers were installed in the Asia Rounds this issue, which was purchased by the Hong Kong Gang, so the market situation is expensive. For example, the upper village of Zhoushanfu needs 68 yuan to 65 yuan, Ningbofu ordinary 33 yuan, new goods 345 yuan, Shandong goods 48 yuan to 50 yuan, up 35 yuan or more each compared with the previous one.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Sesame is Expensive and Charming; It is Sold as Soon as it Arrives

The sesame dark plate market is still outstanding. Because the transportation is difficult, the source is decreasing day by day, the bottom accumulation is empty, it is sold as soon as it arrives, and the market conditions are straight up to Qingyun. Yesterday, it was heard that the foreign village's net goods sesame would open to 21.5 yuan, because there was no supply of goods, the rising energy was very fierce.

### Medicines Sparse Sales for Premium Almonds

Premium almonds come from Qingdao. Their sales, primarily to pharmacies, have been sparse recently. The market is sluggish. Previously, the price was 80 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Yesterday, a certain firm offered them at 75 yuan, a decrease of 5 yuan compared to the previous price.

### Silk and Tea Silk Price Increase Slower Than Dry Cocoons

Yesterday in the silk market, overseas markets were firm. The morning markets in New York and Yokohama were slightly lower than the previous day. New York spot prices fell by one cent, and forward prices by half a cent. Yokohama spot prices decreased by four yuan, and forward prices by two yuan. However, by the afternoon, Yokohama's closing price soared by approximately 10-12 yuan. Local trading was brisk. White filature silk reached a new high price of 78 fen but was not yet offered, as the eastern market's surge caused Shanghai's improved dry cocoons to jump by 20 yuan (320-330 yuan). Based on this calculation, the white filature silk market should have risen by 80 yuan (calculated based on a reeling yield of 400 catties), but the rate of increase in the silk market did not reach this level. Therefore, white filature silk trading temporarily stalled. Only high-grade, fine-strand filature silk had a market with British firms, with prices being very expensive. Seven-star grade sold for 1530 yuan, which is an example. Other American and Indian Chappah silks have been very active recently, and prices have also increased by 10-20 yuan. A total of 50 dan were traded yesterday.

Yesterday, 100 barrels of silk waste were shipped to Italy.

### Import and Export Diesel and Candles Shipped to Beiyang

Today, 400 cases of diesel oil were shipped to Weihaiwei, and 2,000 cases of white wax and 2,000 boxes of candles were shipped to Tianjin. Also, yesterday, 1,000 pieces of native paper were shipped to Tianjin, and 100 barrels of tung oil were shipped to Italy. Additionally, today, 11,000 pieces of native paper are being shipped to Qingdao.

### Metals Customer Sales Show Renewed Activity

Yesterday in the metals market, due to the Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Tianjin, and Qingdao communities purchasing goods for the New Year, trading showed renewed activity. Openings for various iron products reached more than 3,400 dan, with new galvanized iron wire, white galvanized iron wire, yellow steel wire, local factory nails, and Huisi iron being the most abundant. The market was very firm due to the tightening foreign exchange rate. New galvanized iron wire was priced at 18.5 yuan, white galvanized iron wire at 16 yuan, yellow steel wire at 19 yuan, local factory nails at 16.25 yuan, and Huisi iron at 55 yuan. Other items such as British steel plates, angle iron, electrical wire, and black iron nails also had openings, with no major changes in prices. Trading on this street remained peaceful yesterday, with openings for over 1,000 dan of various goods, with tinplate being the most abundant.

### Sugar Market Taikoo Refined White Sugar is Indeed Tight

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The association's benchmark price for current stock of No. 24 Dutch coarse white sugar was 24.6 yuan, with some even quoting 24.65 yuan. Local warehouse sugar was 24.8 yuan, Big Golden Coin brand was 25 yuan, re-export sugar was 16.5 yuan, current stock of Dutch red sugar was 16.6 yuan, re-export sugar was 11 yuan. Taikoo refined white B mark sugar from the Western warehouse was 23.95 yuan, and from the Eastern warehouse was 23.95 yuan. CW mark was 23.7 yuan, CX mark was 23.65 yuan, DY mark was 23.6 yuan, and HX mark was 23.5 yuan. The market is expected to tighten. Chaozhou brokers opened with high-quality Huanggang Qing at 13.12 yuan, totaling two hundred and several tens of packages. Over six hundred packages of old refined red sugar were priced at 15.05-15.1 yuan, and odd white sugar was quoted at 18.5 yuan, with high-tech foreign sugar at 16.5 yuan. Guangdong-Hong Kong brokers opened with over seven hundred packages of Hainan red sugar at 11.9 yuan, and over a hundred boxes of high-quality slab Qing at 11.8 yuan. Jian brokers opened with several tens of packages of miscellaneous roadside white sugar at 21.9 yuan, and Da Gong powder was quoted at 22.5 yuan, and tribute red sugar at 15.1 yuan, but no deals were made.

### Dried and Preserved Goods Tong'an Dried Longan Increases by Another Yuan

Tong'an sun-dried longan, the dozens of boxes that arrived previously, due to customer insistence on a price increase, were held up for a long time. Yesterday, it was heard that a deal had been reached, with an increase of one yuan compared to the previous price. The goods were distributed to various firms proportionally. It was also heard that production prices remain tight, and the market may rise again in the future.

### New Tangerine Peel Candies Market Appears Weak

Xiamen Dou New Tangerine Peel Candies, imported via Taikoo Company's Xinjiang ship, continue to arrive in dozens of barrels. Samples were seen yesterday, with excellent color and size, and the candy base is also very soft and glutinous. However, due to recent slow sales, there are signs of slight weakness.

Previously, 300 packages of dates were imported from Tianjin, and 7,230 packages of shelled peanuts and 600 packages of peanuts were imported from Weihaiwei.

### Municipal Party Department and Various Organizations Congratulate the Fifth Plenary Session and Request the Arrest and Prosecution of Wang Jingwei to Warn Traitors

The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department and various leading organizations in the city jointly sent a telegram to the Central Government yesterday to congratulate the opening of the plenary session. They also stated that Wang Jingwei's collusion with the enemy and advocacy of surrender should be subject to arrest and prosecution to warn traitors. The original telegram read: To Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Kuomintang of China, and the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees: The grand meeting has begun, and all the talented individuals are present. New strategies for resisting Japan and expelling the Japanese invaders have been determined, and nation-building strategies to revitalize our nation have been decided. We are deeply gratified and congratulate you. However, at a time when the war of resistance is entering a new phase, Wang Jingwei dared to collude with the enemy and advocate surrender. His intentions are not only to shake people's hearts but also to undermine the foundation of the nation. Our Central Government, with its magnanimous heart, only gave him the punishment of expulsion from the party and removal from his post, hoping that he would repent and start anew. However, he hid in a foreign land and continued to publish absurd theories, which are truly unforgivable. We request that the meeting issue a clear order for his arrest and prosecution to warn traitors and rectify discipline. We send our thoughts via telegram and pray without end. Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department and various leading organizations in Shanghai respectfully send their regards.

### London Chinese Bonds Rebound Japan Bonds Plummet

According to a reliable source from British merchants in this city, when the London Stock Exchange opened this Monday (the 16th), due to the Chinese government's announcement that Japan had seized tariffs in the guerrilla areas and stopped overdrafts from the Central Bank, bonds secured by tariffs fell by as much as 5 to 1.5 pounds. However, bondholders holding Chinese bonds in the market firmly believed that China's economic foundation was solid and that the war situation was improving, so no one sold them off. British merchants received a telegram from England again yesterday morning. There were no ups and downs in the market this Tuesday (the 17th), and no transactions. By yesterday (the 18th), it finally rebounded. The Anglo-German 4.5% loan (issued by Britain) soared by 2 pounds, and the Post-Reorganization 5% public bond rebounded by 1.5 pounds. As for Japanese bonds, after falling by 1.5 pounds this Monday, they did not rebound at all in the past two days. This is enough to prove that although this countermeasure of the Chinese government suffered a temporary reaction, it is actually more beneficial to the entire national economy of China.

### US Fleet Commander Inspects the Yangtze River Significant Implications Perhaps Related to the Opening of the Yangtze River Japanese Side Unwilling to Have US Ships Sail to Hankou

The Continental News reports that the Commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, and the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, left Shanghai at 8:30 AM yesterday morning (the 18th) to inspect the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. They traveled on Admiral Yarnell's private yacht, the Isabel. If their plans do not change midway, they are expected to travel as far as Wuhu. They are expected to return to Shanghai in the afternoon of the 22nd or the morning of the 23rd. Before leaving Shanghai yesterday, Admiral Yarnell and Consul General Gauss rarely mentioned the purpose of this trip but strongly stated that the trip had no political significance. Although there has been no official explanation, observers in this city believe that this trip must have some important political implications. This can be seen from the fact that all plans for this trip were carried out in an atmosphere of secrecy. Some observers believe that their trip may be related to breaking the current blockade of the Yangtze River and believe that American residents in Wuhu are often obstructed by the Japanese. They may investigate this matter. Also, a news report stated that a Japanese spokesperson said yesterday that the US Asiatic Fleet Commander Yarnell and the US Consul General in Shanghai Gauss's decision to inspect the situation on the Yangtze River, if they want to go upstream from Wuhu to Hankou, the Japanese naval authorities have decided to refuse to send warships to escort them. However, it is still unknown whether Yarnell and his party intend to go directly to Wuhan. Furthermore, when the USS Luzon returned to Shanghai from Hankou last time, it was escorted by Japanese warships along the way. Officials from the USS Luzon told reporters in detail that Japanese warships fired aimlessly at both sides of the Yangtze River along the way, the purpose of which was to deceive the Americans into thinking that navigation on the Yangtze River was still unsafe. The Japanese side has protested to the US side about this matter.

### Ministry of Finance Determined to Maintain Credit This Announcement is Actually in Line with Common Sense Uniform and Reconstruction Bonds Paid in Full as Usual

The Ministry of Finance is determined to maintain credit, and the National Debt Fund Management Committee will continue to conduct lotteries for principal repayment as usual. The Uniform bonds due at the end of this month and the Reconstruction bonds due at the end of February will be paid in full in Chongqing. This announcement that tariff-secured debts will no longer be overdrafted is actually in line with common sense. The Shanghai bond market has stabilized. The details are as follows:

Government Determined to Maintain Credit

Although our government is under extremely strained wartime finances, it has always maintained its credit. Therefore, the market prices of domestic and foreign debts have remained very firm over the years. Since the Ministry of Finance announced that customs duties securing various debts would no longer be overdrafted, the market has misunderstood, and there has been a sharp reaction in foreign exchange, the bond market, the gold market, and cotton yarn. The sharp rise in foreign exchange and gold prices this Monday shows the market's false alarm. The government has always fulfilled its debt repayments on time. In the past, although tax revenues were occasionally short due to natural disasters, man-made disasters, and economic panic, the government would definitely transfer huge amounts of funds to repay them on time. The amount of overdrafts from the Central Bank reached as high as 175 million yuan, which shows the soundness of the government's financial policy and its determination to maintain credit.

Tax Revenue Seized Stop Overdrafting

In the past year, customs revenue has not decreased by much, and there has been dedicated funding that has not been remitted. The government has still generously allowed overdrafting, and its consideration for maintaining credit has exceeded the general circumstances. This, compared with the Japanese side's seizure of tax revenue, shows the greatness of the government's attitude. Bonds that already have dedicated funding are different from those that are secured but have insufficient revenue. There are even huge amounts of dedicated funding accumulated due to guarantees. Therefore, the government's recent suspension of overdrafting is actually in line with common sense. Since the customs agreement published by both Britain and Japan, the transfer of tax revenue to the Japanese side, our government has protested to Britain, which has caused the current lack of funds for some debt interest. People in China and abroad should also be aware of this and know where the responsibility lies.

Domestic Public Bonds Lottery for Principal Repayment

The government's response to this situation is very appropriate. In addition to announcing that customs duties securing various debts will no longer be overdrafted, it also declared that for all long-term debts secured by customs duties that were borrowed before the war but have not yet been repaid, the government will allocate funds from the customs revenue outside the war zone in proportion to the amounts due and deposit them in the Central Bank for dedicated use. It also stated that when customs stations in the war zone remit the arrears of allocated debt repayments in the future, they should still allocate funds for debt repayment. It can also be seen that the government maintains its credit attitude. The National Debt Fund Management Committee will continue to hold lotteries for principal repayment of domestic debts as usual. The public bonds that should be drawn on February 10 are Class A bonds of the Uniform Public Bond.

Uniform and Reconstruction Bonds Paid in Full

The Central Bank has received an order from the head office to allow the full payment of principal and interest of the five types of Uniform Public Bonds A, B, C, D, and E due on January 31 and the Reconstruction Public Bonds due on February 28 in Chongqing. However, in order to facilitate bondholders in Shanghai, the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Trust Bureau are specially authorized to handle payments on behalf of the Central Bank, but payments will be made in six installments, with each installment lasting one month. The detailed rules for installment payments in Shanghai have been promulgated. It is reported that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank will inform the branches of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in both locations and the Shanghai office of the Central Trust Bureau to take note and handle the matter. As for the repayment method for the interest of 421.875 yuan and the principal of 1.125.000 yuan of the 17th-year Financial Long-Term Public Bond due on March 31, the Central Bank has not yet received an order from the Ministry.

Public Confidence Restored Bond Market Stabilized

Since the Ministry of Finance was determined to maintain credit, the bond market in Shanghai's informal trading market stabilized yesterday. The change to paying at the Chongqing head office proves that there is no delay. These two types of public bonds, Uniform and Reconstruction, which are about to mature, will be repaid in full as usual. As a result, public confidence in the market has been restored. Yesterday's closing prices were: Class A 56.35 yuan, Class B 49.9 yuan, Class C 48.85 yuan, Class D 48.1 yuan, and Class E 48.35 yuan, an increase of 0.15 to 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day.

### West Shanghai Guerrillas Active at the Front Lines Four Japanese Soldiers Killed in Xujing Town Japanese Soldiers on Hongqiao Road Under Threat

The situation in West Shanghai has become more tense recently due to the activity of Chinese guerrillas. According to information gathered yesterday from Chinese sources who arrived in Shanghai from West Shanghai, four Japanese soldiers in Xujing Town along the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway were killed by Chinese guerrillas the day before yesterday (the 17th). Yesterday morning, the Japanese sent over a hundred soldiers from Shanghai to conduct a large-scale search. Guerrillas went to Chengjiaqiao on Hongqiao Road and arrested

a Chinese traitor.

The day before yesterday (the 18th), a Japanese man in plainclothes was killed by guerrillas near the Public Works Department garden, east of the Daitoa Bunka Gakuin on Hongqiao Road outside the Western District of the concession. According to foreign sources, on the afternoon of the 18th, a Taiwanese man hired a truck to transport rice for the Japanese army. When the truck traveled to the

vicinity of the nursery

on Hongqiao Road, it was suddenly encountered by a squad of Chinese guerrillas, who arrived on bicycles. They immediately ordered the truck to stop. The Chinese guerrillas took the rice and the truck, and shot and wounded the Taiwanese man. However, the Chinese people in the truck with the Taiwanese man were not harmed. Afterwards, the Japanese army imposed martial law on Hongqiao Road, but the Chinese guerrillas had already calmly retreated. It is believed that the Chinese guerrillas are clearly

approaching the concession

area outside the Western District, so the Japanese army in West Shanghai is extremely panicked. Yesterday morning (the 19th) at eight o'clock, the Japanese army dispatched 400 to 500 soldiers from the city center, along with tanks and armored vehicles, and carried many small steel cannons, to conduct field exercises and demonstrations in the area of Zhongshan Road, Lincoln Road, Bailinan Road, and Hongqiao Road, which will continue for several days. The section of the exercises is located near the British and French defense areas, and the time of the exercises is from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM.

Its headquarters

is located in Zhenjia Township. All areas west of Zhongshan Road, north of Lincoln Road, east of Warren Road, and south of Bailinan Road are within its exercise range. Also, in Huojia Town near Xujiahui, the Japanese army has another exercise every day from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM. It is also heard that Hongqiao Road will be closed to all traffic for the next few days to facilitate martial law. According to the North China Daily News, several roads in West Shanghai were closed from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM yesterday.

### Orphanage for Refugee Children Building New Facilities Preparatory Meeting Held Yesterday Donation Methods Established

The Shanghai Relief Orphanage for Refugee Children, located at No. 9, Shengde Lane, Xiafei Road, has taken in 207 refugee children since its establishment. The orphanage has recently experienced an increasing number of refugee children requesting admission, and the existing facilities are insufficient. In addition to the pharmacy, hairdressing, knitting, music, and drama departments, which have already been established, other major departments have been unable to start on schedule due to the lack of buildings to establish workshops. The orphanage authorities plan to build new facilities and expand operations. They recently sent letters to seek assistance and have obtained support from participating organizations, including 18 trade associations from the pharmaceutical, weaving, freight transportation, steel bar and scrap iron industries, as well as 20 organizations from the Shanghai opera, opera, research association, and entertainment association. A preparatory meeting was held yesterday. The details are as follows:

### President Pierce Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Many Incoming Mails and Goods Sailing to Manila this Morning

The President Line of the United States, in order to restore Sino-US navigation to facilitate passenger and cargo transportation, the head office decided to send the President Pierce to sail from San Francisco, USA on December 25 last year.

### 工部局 Taxpayers' Grievances Over Salary Increases: Weak Police and Firepower, Unjustified Salary Increases for High-Ranking Officials, Taxpayers to Take Action

According to the English-language North China Daily News, taxpayers and other residents have been exchanging various opinions regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's (工部局) salary increases. Suggestions have been made that the Council should allocate funds to hire police, firefighters, and public works personnel, rather than continuing to add substantial salaries to already highly-paid senior officials, which wastes funds. Preparations are underway to initiate a public investigation into the entire affair. Furthermore, they

Criticize the Bureau's

division of staff into different grades, alleging that it is intended to prevent joint action among employees, and mock the Council's motto of "Union is Strength." They criticize the Council's salary cuts and layoffs. The Council previously established an economy committee that reduced the personnel and equipment of the Fire Brigade to below safe standards, resulting in frequent fires last winter, necessitating the recruitment of untrained individuals to

Assist in the Work

The Council continues to congratulate itself, claiming savings of over one million yuan. However, as a result, the Western District of the Public Settlement is filled with factories, all plans for which must be inspected by the Council. The Public Works Department and the Fire Brigade are extremely busy due to staff reductions, the busiest they have ever been. During the construction of these factories, there are no

Sufficient Police

to supervise or prevent the unauthorized addition of buildings. However, because of the inability to prevent it, unauthorized buildings have indeed been constructed. Should carelessness occur, it will be difficult for the Fire Brigade to extinguish the flames. The tragic fire on Avenue Edward VII (愛多亞路) last Saturday is one such example. As for the inadequate protection of the roads outside the Settlement by the police, this has been the case for several years. The police force in the outposts in that area has been weak for at least seven years. Now, it is necessary to borrow a large number of personnel from

Other Police Stations

to patrol in the Western District. If the area north of the Suzhou Creek is opened up, the insufficient personnel in the police force will be a major obstacle, but the Council may not be particularly concerned about this matter, as the area south of the Suzhou Creek already generates substantial revenue. Therefore, the opinion of taxpayers and residents is that the sixty thousand yuan spent on salary increases for a small number of highly-paid officials should be given to lower-paid staff or used to hire more personnel. Now is the time for taxpayers to take action. They have established a group called the Shanghai Municipal Council Taxpayers' Investigation Committee, which has begun its work.

### Taiwan Sugar Smuggling Confirmed: Only 20,000 Piculs Inspected by Customs, Japanese Newspaper Claims One Million Entered Shanghai

According to the Continental Daily News, accurate information regarding the quantity of Taiwan sugar imported under customs control was obtained yesterday (the 18th) from the Statistics Department of the Jianghai Customs. It revealed that from January 1st to 17th, only 110,000 kilograms of Taiwan sugar, valued at 77,000 Customs Gold Units, were imported through customs. For the entire past year, only 3,000 kilograms of Taiwan sugar, valued at only 2,040 Customs Gold Units, were imported through the Jianghai Customs. The total of both is 115,000 kilograms, equivalent to

Approximately 20,000 Piculs.

However, according to the Japanese-language Continental New News published in this port on January 11th, the Taiwan sugar that has already been imported into this port amounts to one million piculs. The amount that has not been imported through customs reaches a huge 980,000 piculs. This figure is undoubtedly the amount of Taiwan sugar smuggled into Shanghai. Now there can be no doubt, and the Continental New News’s report of one million piculs of Taiwan sugar imported is of course absolutely true. On January 13th, a Japanese spokesperson stated at a press conference that the previous article exposing the smuggling of Taiwan sugar into Shanghai was not based on accurate figures, but that

This Large Amount of Taiwan Sugar

was shipped to Shanghai in late last month. However, the customs report for last month did not record any Taiwan sugar imports. The Japanese spokesperson first said that they would investigate, and then claimed that the sugar would be inspected by the Jianghai Customs, but this statement clearly contradicts the news of the Continental New News that one million catties of Taiwan sugar had already been imported into Shanghai. What the Continental New News reported is absolutely true, without any doubt. According to the customs report of this port, the import of Taiwan sugar was very small last November, and has increased relatively since January 1st. However, Taiwan sugar has been

Dumped in Shanghai

since last February. There are both retail and wholesale distributors of Taiwan sugar in Hongkou (虹口), as well as throughout the entire Jinghu Hang (京滬杭) area, and it is even smuggled into the two settlements. A few days ago, the reporter met with personnel from the Dutch trading companies who were importing Java sugar to Shanghai for sale. They all stated that the smuggling of Taiwan sugar into Shanghai has caused the Java sugar trade in this port to decline sharply. Therefore, the

980,000 Piculs

of smuggled sugar is a fact. This large quantity of Taiwan sugar is valued at 16 million yuan, and the unpaid customs duties amount to several million yuan. Foreign reporters in this port have suspected that the interpreter at the Japanese press conference may not have accurately conveyed the words of his "master," and this seems to have cleared up the doubt.

### Headquarters of the 10th Army Group Expedites Cargo Transport: Exported Goods Must Be Approved, Jardine Matheson & Co. and Butterfield & Swire Carry Hong Kong Cargo

After the Headquarters of the 10th Army Group Commander-in-Chief adjusted the Zhejiang Eastern sea routes and approved the sailing of the Valley Line, the loading of cargo must be approved by the Zhejiang Product Agency and the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters. Tung oil and other goods transported to Hong Kong are carried by the vessels of Jardine Matheson & Co. and Butterfield & Swire. The measures are as follows:

Export Requires Certificate

The Ning County Customs Brokers Association and others have received a reply telegram from Commander-in-Chief Liu, instructing that all goods intended for export should first be reported to the Zhejiang Provincial Product Adjustment Office for review and certification, and then submitted to the Headquarters of the 10th Army Group for approval. Exported local goods that have been approved and issued a certificate may be transported for export by approved and registered vessels. Now, the Ning Shao Paper Sales Office has decided to hire the Yongfu vessel of the British company Wah Hing Co. for transport. The Ning Shao District Cotton Sales Office has decided to hire the Kaibo vessel of the British company Wheelock & Co., and the Ende vessel of the Italian company Sino-Italian Co. for transport. The cotton stored in the Shanghai Fusheng Yongzhuang has been hired for transport by the Xinxiang vessel of the British company Inamine Co.

Foreign Vessels Sail Zhejiang-Hong Kong Route

Local products controlled by the Trade Commission, such as tung oil and tea, which must be transported to Hong Kong for centralized export, are designated to be transported by five vessels of the British company Butterfield & Swire, namely Nanchang, Chengdu, Niuzhuang, Yingzhou, and Nanning, and two vessels of the British company Jardine Matheson & Co., namely Hengsheng and Fusheng, directly from ports such as Yongwen and Tai. As for the tung oil purchased in eastern Zhejiang by the Central Trust Bureau entrusted by the Ministry of Finance and the Trade Commission, it is also transported to Hong Kong on the vessels of Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson & Co.

### Danish Vice-Consul Transferred to Europe

According to the North China Herald, Mr. Møller-Christensen, the Danish Vice-Consul stationed in Shanghai, has served for five years, during which he acted as Consul-General for one and a half years. He will return to his home country with his family on the 27th of this month. After a vacation in Denmark, he will go to Beijing as the secretary of the Danish Legation. On the evening of the 17th, forty key Danish residents in this port held a farewell party at a certain association, and six Danish residents presented Mr. Møller-Christensen with a silver cigarette case engraved with their names. According to reports, Mr. Møller-Christensen married in Shanghai three years ago, and both he and his wife are skilled riders. Upon leaving Shanghai, he will take a certain Japanese vessel to Singapore for a week of sightseeing, and then go to Europe. Mr. Andersen, Mr. Møller-Christensen's successor, is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of March.

### British Community Council Re-elects Officers

### Various Groups Commemorate Wang Yiting: Held the Day After Tomorrow, Staff of the Preparatory Office Appointed, Condolence Messages Sent to Renji Hall

After the death of philanthropist Wang Yiting, all circles deeply mourned his loss. The central government, cherishing his virtuous labor, has issued a clear order to commend him and will publish his life deeds in the History Museum. Various fellow villagers' groups from the Lake region in this city have also held a memorial service on the 15th of this month. The memorial service prepared by the Central Relief Committee, the Charity Relief Society, the Refugee Relief Association, and more than a hundred other groups, is scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on the day after tomorrow (the 22nd) at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road. In recent days, the preparatory office has received many condolence messages, elegies, and eulogies from key figures in the central government and from both within and outside of this port. The ceremony will be extremely solemn. The staff of the conference has also been appointed by the preparatory office. If various circles wish to send eulogies, elegies, couplets, etc., please send them to the Renji Hall Memorial Service Preparatory Office on Yunnan Road.

### New Life Movement Association Cares About Fellow Sufferers: Stipulates Standards for Implementing Relief, Adjusts the Structure of Charity Groups to Promote Relief Work, Continues to Raise Winter Clothing and Rewards Overseas Chinese for Donations, Orders Local New Life Movement Branches to Comply

Chairman Chiang of the New Life Movement Promotion Association, in view of the fact that nineteen months have passed since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, and that the need for assistance for soldiers at the front and fellow sufferers in various places is indeed urgent and imminent during this severe winter season, has specially promulgated four standards for implementing this winter's relief campaign, continuing to raise relief funds and materials such as cotton clothing and vests, and has also stipulated that those who donate the most will be commended. He has already ordered the New Life Movement branches and offices in various places to comply. The four standards for implementing the relief campaign are recorded below:

Jointly Promote Relief Work

(1) Regarding refugee relief, the Refugee Relief work has been specially handled by the Relief Committee, which has established a Refugee Relief Committee for Extraordinary Times to take charge of the work. Branches, sub-branches, relief districts, transportation terminals, sub-stations, and reception centers have been set up in various places to implement the evacuation, distribution, accommodation, management, and relief of refugees, and to plan the improvement of refugees' lives, the introduction of occupations, the establishment of factories, the implementation of land reclamation, and the education of refugee children. The work is complex and requires powerful parties to jointly promote it. All our New Life Movement associations in various places should give full assistance to all the above-mentioned work of the Association at any time according to the local situation, and should especially strengthen efforts in publicity and guidance to promote it together and achieve substantial results. As for those New Life Movement associations where the above-mentioned various relief agencies have already been set up, they should adopt close contact, divide the work and cooperate in case of emergency, and give full play to their own functions, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Continue to Raise Winter Clothing

(2) Regarding the raising of winter clothing, the winter season has arrived, and severe cold is imminent. The need for winter clothing for soldiers at the front and fellow sufferers in various places is extremely urgent. The work of raising winter clothing is being actively carried out by the National Winter Clothing Campaign Association, which has established branches in various places to carry out its fundraising plan, raising four million cotton vests for distribution to soldiers at the front, and five million pieces of old cotton clothing for distribution to refugees in various places, and is allowed to convert one national currency yuan into one cotton vest, and five corners into one piece of old cotton clothing for fundraising. Since then, various places have enthusiastically donated and delivered materials, and considerable results have been achieved. However, the need for this winter clothing is extremely urgent, and the number is also extremely large, and it depends on the joint efforts of all parties to achieve complete success. All our New Life Movement associations in various places should assist in a timely manner, and use sincere guidance and powerful publicity to promote justice and fulfill their duties.

Adjust Charity Groups and Organizational Structure

(3) Regarding charitable organizations, there are quite a number of original charitable organizations in various places. Although the organizational work and funding conditions are different, their work purposes are all within the scope of relief. However, because the establishment has been different, and the causes are not uniform, the implementation of the work is inevitably uneven, and while there are not a few who have achieved significant results, there are also many who are not worthy of their name. In the current situation of prolonged resistance and frequent relief efforts, it is appropriate to effectively improve the work efficiency of these organizations, so that they can work together and seek truth from facts, and contribute to the country and the nation. All our New Life Movement associations in various places should carefully consider the local situation, and convene consultations or individual visits to the extreme with a sincere attitude, to urge them to clarify the mission of relief in the period of the War of Resistance and national construction, and strive to automatically adjust the organization, closely unite among each other, and work together and help each other, so as to promote cooperation and achieve practical results.

Encourage Overseas Chinese to Continue Donating

(4) Regarding overseas Chinese, since the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese in various places have enthusiastically donated and delivered materials for various fundraising relief items. The facts are there. The current situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the demand for relief forces is becoming more and more urgent. This large and reliable source must be worked hard to ensure that it is inexhaustible, so as to overcome difficulties together and strengthen the War of Resistance. All our New Life Movement associations for overseas Chinese should actively promote and guide them in a timely manner, and promote the patriotism and love for their hometowns of the local overseas Chinese, so as to continue to donate and promote the former beauty. We should also find ways to start an investigation, and list the names, resumes, and actual achievements of those overseas Chinese who donate or collect relief funds and materials particularly generously, and report them to the Association, and give them honorary awards to encourage them.

### Suggestions for Frugal Donations

— Chen Jie

The nation and its people have reached a critical juncture of survival; no negligence or neglect of personnel is allowed. To be miserly with money and not donate is to risk our descendants becoming slaves.

Dear compatriots in adversity:

Our motherland's sacred national self-defense war has been raging for eighteen months. Apart from those who are insane and soulless beasts in human clothing, every citizen of the Republic of China eagerly anticipates the arrival of final victory. However, this arduous and great task cannot be achieved through empty talk or reliance on others. Every compatriot must dedicate their utmost effort towards this goal to achieve success and complete this unprecedented task in history!

A nation is formed by each and every compatriot. In other words, every compatriot has a stake in the nation. We must not merely blame the soldiers on the front lines for risking their lives to fight the enemy while forgetting our own responsibilities. Although we may not be able to directly take up arms and defend the country, at the very least, we must contribute as much economic power as possible and practice the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength" in the process of resisting aggression and building the nation, in order to support this long-term war that will determine the survival of our country. We are well aware that in the current environment, our meager income is barely enough to make ends meet. However, we also understand that this is indeed a critical moment for the survival of the nation and its people. No negligence or carelessness is allowed, and no neglect or delay of any person or matter is permitted. We must concentrate the human and material resources of all compatriots to jointly drive out the tyrannical enemy. Therefore, even though we are poor, when we think of the clear teaching that the rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual, and that personal matters are small while national matters are great, we are willing to further engage in frugal living in our already difficult circumstances, and dedicate whatever we earn entirely to the nation, to fulfill the duties of a citizen!

We must not think that individual efforts are insignificant and of no benefit to the overall situation. This is a despicable excuse to shirk responsibility. It is important to understand that even a small contribution has an effect. If each of our 450 million compatriots contributes one cent, we can obtain over 5.6 million bullets. If each person contributes ten cents, we can obtain over 1,000 tanks. If each person contributes one yuan, we can obtain over 2,000 fighter planes. Can such strength still be considered small? The saying "many grains of sand form a pagoda, many fox furs make a robe" clearly teaches that accumulating small amounts can lead to great things.

We must not be clever and think that resisting aggression and saving the nation is someone else's business, and that we do not need to concern ourselves with it, and instead seek personal comfort and enjoyment in the present. This is a most shameful and corrupt thought born of a slavish mentality. It is important to understand that if the nation perishes, individuals and their descendants will only live a life of slavery, with no freedom or room for enjoyment. Are the Jews not a famously wealthy people in the world? However, the Jews could not exchange their wealth for a stable life, and instead were exiled to foreign lands, living a displaced and inhuman life, often being driven out and oppressed. They were not only unable to enjoy comfort, but even their lives were not guaranteed! Does this not prove that a slave of a lost nation has absolutely no freedom or enjoyment? The Jews and other people who have lost their countries are struggling daily in a tragic situation of suppressing their voices and tears, trying to accomplish the great task of restoring their homeland. But alas, they have already been tightly bound. When their country was being invaded, their ancestors lacked the determination to resist and were unwilling to sacrifice their personal wealth to safeguard the survival of the country, leading to their descendants being trapped in the pit of slavery forever, unable to be reborn. Tracing the root cause, it is all because their ancestors were greedy for temporary comfort and made a big mistake. Dear compatriots! They made a fatal mistake due to a momentary thought, leaving endless regret for their descendants. When we think of this, can we not feel our hair stand on end and shudder? Now we still have the opportunity to defend our country. Our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, is leading all compatriots in a long-term war of resistance, striking back at the aggressors. Moreover, the enemy's feet are sinking deeper and deeper into the mud, and the day of their collapse is within sight. The key to our final victory is hanging by a thread. Can we bear to be slaves of a lost nation and miss this only opportunity to revive our nation? Dear compatriots! Wealthy compatriots! Wake up quickly! Do not only seek personal comfort, do not be stingy with money and value it more than protecting the country. You should also think about your descendants.

The soldiers on the front lines are fighting bravely and regarding death as home, using their flesh and blood to resist the enemy's guns and cannons! They are offering their most precious lives to the nation and its people. What is it for? It is only to defend the beautiful rivers and mountains left behind by our ancestors! We are also part of the nation, can we bear to stand by and shirk the responsibility we should bear for the country? No! Never! For the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation! In order to wash away past humiliations, in order to avenge the compatriots who were killed and the loyal and brave soldiers who sacrificed themselves to defend the country, we must take out the strength condensed from everyone's sweat and blood. We should establish a voluntary commitment to frugality and donation, remembering that contributing even a little strength can increase our chances of victory. We must condense the strength of our 450 million compatriots into a brand new, independent, and free New China!

Outline of the Frugal Donation Group:

(1) Purpose: To encourage each other to overcome national difficulties, save financial resources, and contribute to the country to support the war of resistance to the end.

(2) Members: Anyone who agrees with the purpose of frugality and is able to fulfill it may join.

(3) Organization: Based on relationships such as residential area, hometown, school, and classmates, form a group of ten people. Each group will have one secretary responsible for liaison and presiding. All donations will be collected by the secretary and submitted to the receiving organization (newspaper office or bank). All receipts must be publicly announced or circulated at any time to ensure credibility. If there are too many people, another group can be formed.

(4) Meetings: Each month, rotate holding meetings in the form of family tea parties, dinners, or other gatherings, to report on progress and discuss the promotion of work.

(5) Work: Conscientiously practice frugality (each member should encourage everyone to save at least one cent of national currency per day, the more the better, each according to their ability), try to use domestic goods, persuade relatives and friends to be frugal, and make them participate in promoting the work and promote the spirit of saving the nation.

(6) Creed: We cannot survive without saving the country, we cannot save the country without organization, ten people with one heart will become a basic organization of iron.

(7) Commandments: Do not waste ambition on dancing, do not waste money on prostitution and gambling, do not be stingy with money to contribute to the country, and do not buy or sell enemy goods.

### Young Woman Secretly Poisons Stepmother, Stepmother Dies Tragically, Mother and Daughter Often Quarrel, Leading to Malice, Girl Reveals Hidden Truth, Case is Finally Discovered

Zhuang Xu, an old woman from Songjiang, residing at No. 146, Lane 572, Peng Road, is 60 years old and has recently been suffering from stomach ailments and coughing. She lives with her adopted daughter, Qian Zhuang, who is 32 years old and already married. The daughter is known to be fond of wandering and extravagant, leading to frequent quarrels between mother and daughter. Before the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the daughter was severely scolded by her mother for something. In a moment of anger, she wanted to commit suicide and went to a Japanese pharmacy on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, paid three yuan, and bought a bottle of poisonous pills, a total of ten pills, and brought them home, intending to swallow them and end her life, so as to avoid

All sorts of troubles

There was no interest in living in this world. At that time, because she could not abandon her four children, two boys and two girls, she did not perform this tragedy. She secretly hid the bottle of pills until now. Her husband, Qian Wenbiao, knew nothing about it. Over time, there were frequent quarrels between the mother and daughter, and Qian Zhuang, feeling that her adoptive mother, Zhuang Xu, was old and garrulous, suddenly had malicious intentions. Taking advantage of the fact that her mother was decocting herbs to treat her stomach ailment and cough drops in the courtyard on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 8:30, she secretly took out the ten pills and put them into the medicine pot. After the mother drank it, on the morning before yesterday

At four o'clock, the poison took effect

Gasping for breath on the bed, she was rushed to Guangren Hospital for treatment but it was too late and she died after a while. Guo Cai, Zhuang Xu's niece, noticed that the deceased's palms were black and saliva was flowing from her mouth. Knowing that her aunt's death was definitely due to accidentally drinking some kind of poison and being secretly harmed, she questioned Qian Zhuang's biological daughter, Yu Zhen (11 years old). Yu Zhen said that she had seen her grandmother's cough medicine pot, and her mother had put a package of pills into it. Guo Cai then learned that Qian Zhuang had

Murdered her adoptive mother

And hurriedly reported it to the Huixin Detective Office, which dispatched Chinese Detective Fang Qingyun to No. 34 Maber Road to arrest Qian Zhuang and take her to the police station for detention. At the same time, Zhuang Xu's body was taken to the Jiaozhou Road Mortuary for examination. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Qian Zhuang to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested an extension to keep the defendant in custody. Following this, Guo Cai and the defendant's

Eleven-year-old daughter

Qian Yuzhen, provided proof. According to the deceased's son-in-law, Qian Wenbiao, the mother and daughter often quarreled in the past, blaming his wife for loving to travel and spending money, with no other matters. Unfortunately, such a thing happened. When asked of Qian Zhuang, she directly admitted that she had put the poisonous pills into the pot of cough medicine that her mother had drunk, without denying it. Judge Huang Risheng ordered that she remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days later.

### A Paper Package Under the Armpit, Smuggled Opium Found, Totaling 124 Taels, Two Masterminds on the Run

Chief Detective Ye Yuxi and detectives Guo Shouxin of the Seventh Criminal Section of the General Patrol Room learned that opium dealers were transporting opium and waiting to make contact in the Datong Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, Datong Lane. They secretly waited in Datong Lane at 10:10 on the morning of the day before yesterday and arrested Zhang Fugui, a resident of Ningbo. A paper package was found under his armpit, containing 124 taels of opium. He was taken to the Xinzha Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court. Police station lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, prosecuted him in accordance with Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Opium Prohibition, and requested a postponement in order to arrest his accomplices. Zhang Fugui confessed that this matter was entrusted to him by Wang Youxing and Bao Afa, who are on the run, to buy MSG, and he did not know it was opium, and he also hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. Judge Liu reviewed the confession and ordered Zhang to remain in custody and reschedule the hearing for seven days later.

### Smuggling Opium, Japanese and Puppets Compete, A Large Amount of Opium Intercepted on the Takasho Shosho Maru

After the implementation of the public sale of opium in Shanghai West, the uneven distribution of profits between the Japanese and puppets has caused fierce undercurrents. The puppet authorities are now intercepting the transportation of opium in Pudong, except for those with armed protection. On the morning of the 16th, the puppet "Water Patrol Team" confiscated more than 1,600 taels of opium on a Shosho Maru small steamer on the Takasho Pudong surface, and detained seven smugglers including Shen Abing (namely Blind Abing, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison by the court for making red pills before the war, and was released after the Shanghai War). Yesterday, they were sent to the puppet "Judicial Department" for disposal. It is heard that the puppet authorities took this action to retaliate against the Shanghai opium trade for not reporting their income, it is said.

### Husband and Father-in-Law Abusing Each Other, Young Woman Sues for Divorce, Marriage Forced by Parents, Never Lived Together in Eight Years, Court Recommends Reconciliation and Reschedules Hearing

Wang Changfu, a native of Huzhou, residing at No. 23, Lane 228, Tongfu Road, Shanghai West, runs a silk business and is quite wealthy, owning real estate in Jiangwan. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, his property has fallen into the war zone and his business has also suffered a setback, and his livelihood is not as prosperous as it used to be. His eldest son, Jiajun, is now twenty-eight years old and is still studying at university. As the national army retreated westward, most of the schools were moved to safe areas in Xiang, Shu, Dian, and Qian, and Jiajun went to Chongqing to study at Tongji University. This time, he asked for leave and came to Shanghai last month, and was immediately

Sued by his wife, Ling Juanhua

Lawyer Zu Yufu, sued the First Special District District Court for permission to live apart and ordered Changfu and Jiajun, father and son, to jointly pay alimony. The marriage of Jiajun and Juanhua was arranged by the parents of both parties at that time. At the time of the engagement, Jiajun was still studying at Jiangwan Lida Academy. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, a auspicious date was chosen. Jiajun, upon hearing that his father Changfu would also remarry, showed that he did not want to marry. Then, Changfu told him that if he could marry the woman on schedule, he would dispel the idea of remarrying. Jiajun then followed strict orders and held a wedding with Miss Ling at Hongyun Restaurant. At that time, his family was still at the San Tai Pier in Nanshi. That evening

Guests filled the door

During the feast, a guest suddenly said to Jiajun, "In half a month, those of us who congratulate you tonight will congratulate your father again." Jiajun was shocked to realize that his father's words were untrustworthy. In anger, he left home for school the next day. Since then, he did not often return home. When he did, he showed very little affection for his new bride. For seven or eight years, he did not change this attitude. Juanhua initially thought that although she was subjected to her husband's cold shoulder, she was fortunate to be favored by her father-in-law, so she did not feel pain. However, two years ago, due to a lawsuit with her father-in-law over a deposit, she actually won the case, but the father-in-law and daughter-in-law became estranged from then on and returned to her mother's house. When Huzhou fell, she still returned to live in Shanghai. Changfu could not help but speak harshly to her, and Juanhua felt that

Her husband and father-in-law were abusing her

Making it really unbearable to live together. Last month, Jiajun came back and told relatives and friends that divorce was the only way to relieve the pain of both parties. Therefore, Juanhua believed that she had reached the end of her rope and there was no way to recover, so she filed a lawsuit with the court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ni Zheng Ao opened a hearing and summoned the defendants Wang Changfu and Wang Jiajun, father and son, who did not appear in court, but only sent lawyers to represent them. The plaintiff, Ling Juanhua, explained the facts of the years after the marriage, stating that she had never lived with Jiajun for a single night. In recent years, the treatment of the elders has become increasingly cold, and she is not even full. At this point, she burst into tears, and her attorney then presented a more systematic statement of the

Abuse situation

To the court and requested that she be separated from the defendants, and that the defendants, father and son, be ordered to withdraw 12,000 yuan and deposit it in the court as a fund for the plaintiff's living expenses of 100 yuan per month. She also requested that the defendants be summoned to court, so that the facts of the abuse could be clearly questioned. Then, the defendants' lawyers refuted each of the points of the plaintiff's accusation one by one, stating that the plaintiff still had thousands of yuan from the lawsuit stored in the bank. The plaintiff claimed that she had lost it on the way to escape, which was not true. There must be resources to maintain her life, and the defendants did not admit to the abuse. Judge Ni

Encouraged reconciliation outside the court. He then ordered a rescheduling of the hearing.

The court approved the request.

### Japanese Trading Company Interpreter Falsely Reports Plot to Harm, Claims Someone Accused Him of Being a Traitor, Mostly Due to a Guilty Conscience

Feng Guoji, a native of Tongzhou, is thirty years old and lives at No. 345, Kunming Road. He works as an interpreter for the Japanese trading company Ishii on Sichuan Road, No. 330. Recently, Feng suddenly became nervous, often feeling that someone was accusing him of being a traitor and plotting to harm his life. At 7:00 on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Feng suddenly went to the Wayside Police Station to report to interpreter Situ Guanghe, stating that four Chinese had come to his house, knocked on the door, and accused him of being a traitor. Observing their behavior, they were actually plotting to harm him, so he came to report. However, after investigation by Chinese Detective Gu Zhongshu, it was discovered that Feng's report was actually a psychological effect caused by neurological disorder after drinking, which was completely untrue. He was detained because Feng should not have made such a false report. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Police station lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted him in accordance with Article 214 of the Criminal Code and presented the fact that Feng had also reported to the police station last year that someone had thrown bricks at his house. After questioning by Judge Zhan Liangce, Feng was given appropriate punishment.

### Shanghai Special Edition: Shanghai Schools During the War of Resistance - Education - Chong Gan

Shanghai is China's largest metropolis, covering an area of 49,469 square kilometers. According to pre-war statistics, it had a population of 3,264,229, not only being the center of national industry and commerce and economy, but also the most developed in the country in terms of education and culture. After the start of the War of Resistance, due to its crucial location, it was the first to fall into the war zone. Although the damage suffered by educational and cultural institutions from artillery fire has not yet been statistically analyzed, it can be described as an unprecedented catastrophe. Fortunately, the education administrative authorities and educators at all levels have been able to uphold public loyalty and support the country, enduring hardships. A portion of the schools in the war zone have moved into the concessions to start classes within possible limits, while those originally in the concessions have continued teaching without interruption to this day. Furthermore, due to the sharp increase in the population of Shanghai after the war and the large number of young people attending school, many schools have also been established to meet social needs. In addition, due to the expansion of the war zone, many schools from neighboring provinces have relocated to Shanghai to resume classes. All of these efforts are sufficient to barely maintain the lifeline of education. This article briefly describes the general situation of higher education, secondary education, primary education, and compulsory education during the War of Resistance, in order to inform those concerned about Shanghai's education during the War of Resistance.

1.  Higher Education

Before the war, there were a total of 31 schools above the junior college level in Shanghai. A list is provided below:

Shanghai Pre-War Junior College and Above Schools List

National: Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Jinan University, Shanghai Business College, Shanghai Medical College, Sino-French Engineering College, Music Conservatory, Transportation Department Merchant Marine School, Ministry of Finance Taxation Academy Shanghai First Branch and Second Branch, Sino-French University Pharmaceutical College. Private: Datong University, Daxia University, Aurora University, Shanghai Baptist University, Fudan University, Guanghua University, China Institute, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Shanghai Law College, Zhengfeng Arts College, Soochow University Law School, Shanghai College of Law and Political Science, Tongde Medical College, Chih Tze College, Southeast Medical College, East Asia Physical Education College, Xinhua Art College, Shanghai Art College, St. John's University.

Municipal: Shanghai Municipal Physical Education College.

Among the above 31 schools, their pre-war distribution was as follows: 4 in the South Shanghai District, 3 in the Zhabei District, 4 in the First Special District, 7 in the Second Special District, 1 in the Yinyin District, 2 in the Wusong District, 4 in the Jiangwan District, 2 in the city center, 2 in the Zhenru District, and 2 in the Fahua District. According to this calculation, of the 31 schools in the city, with the exception of the 12 schools in the First and Second Special Districts, the remaining 20 schools have all fallen into the war zone. Even among the schools in the Special Districts, some have relocated to other safe locations for classes due to the special environment of their original sites. The extent of the losses can be generally seen. Fortunately, with the hard work of the school authorities, one after another, they moved into the concessions and successively resumed classes. As of now, except for five schools that have been suspended, including Merchant Marine School, Taxation Academy Second Branch, China Institute, and Municipal Physical Education College, and Tongji University, which has moved to the inland areas, the rest continue to operate. Although the material losses are great, the spirit of dedication is even greater. The current status of each school is listed below to show a general overview.

### Letter

To the Editor,

Having read the Shanghai Special Edition column on page 14 of the fourth section of your newspaper dated January 15 of this year, which contained the system table of Toyo Cotton Mill Co., Ltd., and included the phrase "(Acquisition said… Tianjin Beiyang Cotton Mill 27.000)", we have verified that the factory is managed by our company and remains as before, with no acquisition having taken place. The statement made is not factual. We would appreciate it if your newspaper would correct this. We are very grateful for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Chengfu Trust Co., Ltd., January 19.

### European Rogue Commits Numerous Crimes - Jewish Woman Deceived - Gold Ring and Gramophone Both Swindled - Sentenced to Six Months, Returns to Prison Life

As a result of Germany's drastic anti-Jewish policies, the Jews in Germany were like homeless dogs, fleeing in all directions. Among them, many crossed the ocean to Shanghai. Therefore, today, the refugees living in the "isolated island" consist of Chinese and foreigners. The cause of their displacement was created by the invaders. Therefore, we should have sympathy for these Jewish refugees. However, there is a European rogue of uncertain nationality, Morton Lauren Baron, who had just been released from prison. On the day when a ship carrying Jewish refugees arrived in Shanghai from overseas last month, he waited at the pier. When the refugees disembarked, he

Expressed Great Diligence

Acting as a self-appointed guide, he volunteered to be their guide, directing them to places of lodging. Among the refugees, those who were new to Shanghai and had no relatives to turn to thought that they were all people who had fallen to the ends of the earth, and there was no need to know each other upon meeting. They listened to him and followed him, especially a young Polish woman named Hella Lawson Schwiek and another refugee, who were both taken by him to a Westerner hotel on Yuwei Road. Later, he told the two women that they needed to exchange their foreign currency for legal tender in order to use it. The two women agreed, and one gave him one pound of English gold, and the other gave him four pounds, asking him to exchange them for usable legal tender, but they were all embezzled. On

Christmas Eve

The Baron was staying at the Paramount Hotel. He used the excuse of celebrating Christmas to ask the Polish woman to bring a gramophone that she had brought with her from Europe to his residence for them to enjoy together. From then on, the item was never returned. Although the woman sent a letter requesting its return, he ignored it. On the 4th of this month, the Baron was evicted by the hotel owner for owing more than 140 yuan in room and board. The gramophone, along with the Baron's leather bag, was seized. Last week, the Jing'an Temple Police determined that the Baron had not only repeatedly committed fraud against women in Shanghai, for which he had previously been sentenced to imprisonment by the Detention Court and had just been released after serving his term, but also had committed numerous crimes in the United States, Germany, and Italy in previous years. He was indeed a

Scourge of Society

Therefore, he was re-detained and sent to the First Special District District Court. At that time, it was not yet known that he had defrauded Jewish refugees of their property. He was only accused of defrauding the Paramount Hotel of room and board. He had claimed to be an advertising businessman from overseas and a Canadian pilot when he first arrived at the Paramount Hotel. The accusation had already been investigated and was awaiting judgment in custody. The day before yesterday, the Polish woman, Schwiek, reported to the police because the property she had demanded was not returned. However, the other woman who was defrauded of four gold pounds did not request the police to investigate. Therefore, when the sentence was announced yesterday, police lawyer Qian Xunjiu appeared in court to

Add Additional Charges

For defrauding Schwiek of her gold pound note and gramophone, and explained the circumstances of the defendant's fraud, requesting that he be punished accordingly. Questioned, the Baron confessed that after exchanging the gold pounds for legal tender, in addition to expenses such as the woman's luggage transportation costs, the remaining funds were used to buy wine and meat to celebrate Christmas with the woman's consent. The gramophone had been seized by the Paramount Hotel, and he requested to be sent elsewhere to avoid being unable to make a living in Shanghai. After the hearing, the court sentenced him to six months in prison, and he entered prison again to live his prison life. It is said that in the fraud cases he committed in various countries, both in China and abroad, the victims were all women, which shows that he considered women to be easily deceived.

### Five Robberies

At around 9 PM last night, a Japanese man was walking on Tianjin Road in the Public Concession. At that time, four or five thugs jumped out of a dark place on the side of the road and stopped him. Without saying a word, they searched his body. The Japanese man was unable to resist and had all 45 yuan of Japanese currency stored in his pocket robbed and the thugs escaped. Due to the dim streetlights in that section of the road, the appearance and clothing of all the bandits could not be identified. He went to the police station in charge to report the incident.

At around 6:30 PM yesterday evening, a residence at No. 59, Lane 974, Changping Road was robbed by twelve or thirteen bandits, four of whom were armed. However, the homeowner did not have large savings stored at home, so only clothing and other items worth more than 400 yuan were stolen. The victim provided a detailed list of the stolen items and reported the incident to the police for investigation.

At around 6:10 PM yesterday evening, a cloth shop at No. 48 Wuhu Road was suddenly visited by six bandits. At that time, three armed bandits guarded the people, while other unarmed bandits ransacked the shop. However, because the shop did not have large sums of money, only several tens of dollars were obtained. The bandits, feeling unsatisfied, continued to rob several bolts of cloth stored in the shop and escaped. The total loss was more than 120 yuan. The shop reported the incident to the police and requested a strict investigation.

At around 7 AM yesterday morning, a resident at No. 17, Lane 627, Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai was robbed by four bandits while the victim was still in bed. One bandit held a handgun and threatened everyone, while another bandit held a sharp axe and made a show of force, forcing them to hand over the box keys. The unarmed bandits searched the house and robbed more than 400 yuan in cash and escaped. After the incident, it was reported to the police in charge for record and investigation.

At around 7:20 AM yesterday morning, three bandits broke into No. 4651 Robison Road in West Shanghai. Each bandit held a handgun and threatened the men and women in the house, prohibiting them from making any noise, and forced them to hand over the box keys to ransack the house. However, the house did not have much stored, so only cash, items, etc., worth more than 130 yuan were robbed. The victims reported the robbery to the police and requested an investigation.

### Across from the Continental Hotel in an Alley - Drug Trafficking Organization Cracked - 120 Pounds of Opium Seized - 21 Suspects Arrested Separately

Ye Yuxi, a Chinese detective of the Narcotics Division of the General Police Station, detectives Liu Zhaonian and Guo Shouxin, etc., learned that someone was organizing a large-scale opium trafficking organization at No. 4, Lane 49, next to the Continental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. The opium was secretly transported to Shanghai from Tianjin. Therefore, they immediately coordinated with Western detective Nanyingte, etc., and went to the address the day before yesterday to search. They seized three boxes of opium, totaling 120 pounds,

Worth 20,000 Yuan

At that time, there was only a sick woman and a maid in the room. According to the maid, who was named Bao Meihua, the opium belonged to her master (the sick woman)'s husband, Little Anhui. Her master was currently in Room 228 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, etc. The detectives ordered the maid to lead them to Room 228 of the Oriental Hotel, where they arrested Ji Yunfa (Little Anhui), Wang Wenfu, Chen Xiaogouzi, Li Fengming, Zhou Xinhai, Xu Arong, Li Yonghua, Wang Longquan, Chen Asi, Wang Guansheng, and other ten people. Then, they arrested Wang Yinzhang, Zhu Yungao, Li Chunqing, Zhu Xinjie, Song Changqing, Wang Xitang, Xia Xiaosanzi, and other seven people at No. 4, Lane 49. Subsequently, it was learned that there was still

The Main Culprit in the Case

Named Teng Jingshan, in Room 227 of the Zhonghui Building on Edward Road. They went to the address to arrest him, but Teng had already fled. They only arrested Zou Yaodong, Zhang Enhua, Hu Chengzhai, Yu Xiling, and other four people and brought them to the Chengdu Road Police Station. After investigation, the sick woman and the maid were released as they were not involved. The remaining 21 people, including Ji Yunfa, were all detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan detailed the circumstances of the case and requested permission to detain them for investigation. Judge Fu Lin briefly questioned Ji Yunfa and others and ordered that they be detained for seven days for further review.

### Foreign Young Woman Uses Deceptive Tricks - Swindles Diamond Ring

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, a foreign young woman, lavishly dressed, came to the Alexander Russian Jewelry Store on Nanjing Road the week before last Sunday and selected

A Ring

Asking someone to wait at the Cathay Hotel for her husband to bring the money. However, when she arrived in front of the store, she suddenly said that she did not want the ring and ordered the person to take it back. After the ring arrived at the store, it was discovered that it had been switched. It was too late to report to the police. It is said that the ring was worth 955 yuan.

### Two Men and Women Commit Suicide by Hanging

Zhu Yao, a young woman from Ningbo, 26 years old, wearing a blue silk cheongsam, went to Qinghe Inn, Qinghefang, Guangdong Road, with her husband the night before last and booked Room 127. The name Zhang Jun was written on the register. Yesterday afternoon, the couple had a quarrel. Shortly after, after her husband went out, she became depressed and took her own life by hanging herself in the room. The body was taken to Renji Hospital and transferred to the coroner's office to await examination.

Zhou Xiting, a 27-year-old man from Changzhou, lived at No. 10, Tongchang Lane, Haining Road. Zhou went to Tongshang Hostel at No. 42 Avenue Edward VII a few days ago and rented Room 81 to stay overnight. Yesterday, he suddenly committed suicide by hanging himself in the room without anyone knowing. At around 5 PM, his brother-in-law, Chen Asong, came to visit and discovered the body. He immediately called an ambulance to send him to the hospital for treatment. Because he could not be saved, he was transferred to the coroner's office to await examination. It is said that the reason for his suicide was due to economic pressure.

### Resistance and Freedom

— Bai Ying

The American writer Roger William Ries recently published a short essay in the American magazine "Forum" entitled "The Ideal of Liberty." His opening remarks are quite worthy of our contemplation. He said that a professor at Columbia University in the United States once quoted the following passage to a group of people:

The nation and its institutions belong to the people of that nation. Whenever they feel weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right to amend it or their revolutionary right to overthrow it.

He asked if the above statement was "Red." Some in the audience thought that these words came from Lenin or Stalin, and they expressed great disgust. When he told them that the passage was originally said by Lincoln, the audience nodded in agreement, considering it the truth. The United States is one of the few democratic countries in the present world where people can enjoy freedom of thought and freedom of speech. But in the above example, we can see that the American people—at least a part of them—have not yet obtained true freedom, because in their minds, there is still a prejudice against the enemy of freedom. If this passage were not said by Lincoln, but by Lenin or Stalin, they would express disgust. This attitude indicates that they cannot obtain the true essence of freedom in thought or speech.

However, this does not mean that the United States has no freedom. The United States is one of the countries in the present world that gives its people the most freedom. Originally, if the concept of freedom is understood without the epistemology of practice, this freedom is empty, it is false freedom. A small part of the American people (and other countries as well), because they have been poisoned by fascist propaganda, view the words of Stalin and Lenin as untrustworthy. They seek truth based on personal prejudice, and as a result, they spoil the freedom they can enjoy and should enjoy.

We know that the United States is a highly capitalist country, where the freedom that is valued is individual freedom. They believe that the freedom of democracy lies in developing individual freedom as much as possible. This is like Christianity believing that developing the good side of individuals can create a paradise on earth. But this view of placing too much emphasis on individual freedom is open to criticism.

Materialist philosophy tells us that the category of freedom maintains a relative relationship with the recognition of practice. The deeper our practical understanding, the greater our realm of freedom. But the so-called practical understanding refers to the understanding that progresses along the path of truth. The relationship between understanding and freedom is also applicable to the relationship between understanding and truth.

If we depart from a certain degree of the category of truth and only focus on the development of individual freedom, then individual freedom will inevitably run into a wall, as the aforementioned situation in the United States is an example.

In the case of China during the war of resistance, the situation is exactly the opposite. During the war of resistance, the individual freedom of the Chinese people seems to be quite restricted. Many soldiers who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield lost not only their individual freedom, but even their individual lives. The general pacifist arguments against all wars in the international community stem from this individualistic point of view.

In fact, the freedom we lost in the war of resistance is only false freedom. What we are fighting for with our blood is true freedom—truth. When a nation is under foreign aggression, the entire nation has no freedom to speak of, let alone individual freedom. But precisely because the war of resistance is a struggle for truth, a struggle for the true freedom and survival of the nation, it is the practice of recognizing the category of truth, so the freedom obtained during the war of resistance and at the end is the true freedom of mankind.

Let me give a practical example as evidence for the conclusion of this article: Let us rationally reflect on ourselves, haven't the most important freedom of speech and freedom of thought made amazing progress before and after the war of resistance? This is an iron guarantee that the war of resistance gives us freedom.

### An Ordinary Story

— Hu Kan

(1)

When the flood of war was about to spread to Village X, the whole village was greatly disturbed. Everyone tried to avoid this pervasive flood, hoping that this flood would not flow here.

(2)

—Morning! Father Fugeng.

—Morning! Little Duck.

One morning, at the entrance of Bajinzi's house, Father Fugeng and Little Duck met.

—Did you hear it last night? Ah! I was scared to death!

—Where didn't I hear it? I'm afraid the city has already been captured!

The yellow sunlight climbed onto their faces, fully revealing their fear.

At this time, people gathered from all directions, gradually increasing in number. Just like yesterday, they were chatting about the terrifying situation last night, with each person saying a sentence or two.

—We don't need to talk about the past. Now the most important thing is to send someone into the city to inquire about information.

Father Fugeng said angrily.

Little Duck bravely stood up.

—Father Fugeng! Let me go.

—You go? ... We really don't have anyone else, so you go, be careful.

Little Duck stepped forward and left without any hesitation. Everyone's eyes followed him from afar, until his back disappeared behind the sorghum stalks.

(3)

Time passed quickly... The sun had already set, but Little Duck was still not to be seen, so everyone began to panic.

—Alas! He hasn't come yet at this time!

Father Fugeng was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot, pacing back and forth in front of the crowd with his hands behind his back. Everyone was silent, silently looking at the distant fields.

(4)

The rumbling sound of cannons still came through the overlapping houses and the wide fields, and sometimes mixed with bursts of rapid machine-gun fire. Flickering starlight flashed at the entrance of Bajinzi's house. From the half-extinguished firelight, a group of dark heads could be seen.

—Father Fugeng! Do you see what's flashing over there in the wheat field?

Sure enough, the black shadow in the wheat field gradually approached. It was not until the dim light of the lantern could illuminate it that it was recognized as Little Duck, whom everyone was looking forward to.

—Little Duck!

—How is it?

—Has the city been lost?

People swarmed up, wrapping Little Duck tightly.

—The city was lost last night….

Little Duck was panting, wiping the sweat from his forehead as he spoke.

—I almost lost my life. Luckily, Rongsheng was there.

—What about that little rascal Rongsheng?

—Father Fugeng! Speak a little lighter, we can't call him a little rascal anymore!

Mentioning Rongsheng, everyone's mind seemed to conjure up that habitual rogue who specialized in robbing things.

—Why?

—Now he's rich. This morning when I entered the city, I was seen by the Japanese, and he said I was some kind of "fried bean." Luckily, Rongsheng was sitting next to the Japanese, saying something, and they released me.... Later, I heard people in the city say that because Rongsheng led the Japanese into the city, they invited him to be the chairman of something. He spoke with a lot of spittle, as if he felt very honored.

—Who cares about him! This traitor, rogue chairman! He can let you go, but he can't let everyone go.

—Hmmm...

Little Duck shrank his head and neck, looking like a plucked duck, unable to speak.

—I knew he would do this. Look how lawless he was?

—That short-lived rascal... everyone said subconsciously.

But some people finally thought of their own village, and a chill ran down their spines:

—If Rongsheng becomes an official, what will happen to our village...

The elderly Father Fugeng was very confused. He couldn't give everyone an idea.

—Hey: Tomorrow we'll go to the city and ask him to tell the Japanese not to come down to the villages to harass us, okay?

(5)

Tomorrow someone brought news from the city that the newly appointed Chairman XX was shot by some "fried bean."

### Surviving Writings from Mount Qi (Part 2)

— Yun Jun

—Folk Novel Analysis

The book also pointed out various factors that led to the failure of the resistance at the time, such as the lack of fighting spirit among the officers and generals of the government army, who defended themselves with their troops and fled in panic after a defeat. General Zheng in the fourth chapter and Hu Laigong in the eighth chapter are typical examples of this kind of person. Some even used the pretext of raising troops to create a false appearance, specializing in extorting money and food and robbing the wealth of the people, as recorded in chapters 20, 21, and 23. The people's army, except for Yan Shi's troops, mostly took advantage of the chaos to avenge themselves, resulting in a complete lack of discipline, even killing each other (as recorded in chapters 40 to 43). When faced with war, they either remained stationed and did not move, or dispersed one after another, such as Hu Longguang, who had no intention of defending the city and watched Qing troops attack the city without firing an arrow (chapter 28), and Shi Ziqiu's troops, who scattered completely as soon as they heard the news of the city's fall (chapter 31). Those in charge were either scholars who talked about military affairs without any preparation, such as Jin Bin, who went to Jiangyin's rescue without any prior contact and without any plans during the war (chapter 18); or they seized the opportunity to raise troops without any national identity, such as Shi Ziqiu in chapter 26 and Ling Si in chapter 42. At that time, government officials and gentry did not hesitate to lose face and surrender to the enemy, acting as accomplices, such as Qian Qianyi, Xiao Shien, and Magistrate Ma, who were all used by the enemy one after another. Even those who were responsible for defending the land, such as Cao Yuanfang, fled alone before the city fell. The common people, in addition to seeking to preserve their lives, did not care about the safety of the nation. What is most heartbreaking is that there were even traitors in the people's army who were willing to be guides for the enemy, such as Zhao Botao, who was like Wang Bamei and Xu Hongfa at the time. These are historical relics, but the painful lessons will make us, who were born more than 200 years later, feel indignant!

The entire book seems to revolve around Yan Shi's uprising of local troops, but because there are so many characters and such a complex plot, the status of the main characters has been reduced a lot. The story of Yan Shi is only recorded in five or six chapters, and there are only two instances of him using troops, which clearly loses the unity of the entire book. Furthermore, the war of resistance by Vice Magistrate Yan and the heroic sacrifice of all the people of Jiangyin are both excellent subjects, but the author did not make good use of them. Instead, he only gave a few perfunctory sentences of light description, and instead worked hard to write about the private fights of the people in the countryside and the stories of escaping from death, which occupied a quarter of the entire book (such as chapters 22, 28, 30, 34 to 36, 38, 40 to 43, 50, 51, 53, and 54, a total of 15 chapters), which inevitably reversed the importance of things. The author witnessed the Qing troops' massacre. He should have had some good feelings towards the uprising of the local troops, but he didn't. Instead, he thought it was meddlesome. For example, in chapter 22, Chen Mengli, who dared to speak out, said: "Changshu is only a small place. The Qing Dynasty is powerful. It is better to send someone to negotiate with them and observe their movements. If we start a war rashly, it is like trying to stop a cart with a mantis's arms." In chapter 37, the author himself actually came out and said: "They are all just bamboo spears and wooden sticks, wrapped in white cloth. To fight with the Qing Dynasty is truly like trying to stop a cart with a mantis's arms." This is exactly the same as today's advocates of "weapons only." The author was a person of the Ming Dynasty, so he should have had thoughts about the fallen state of the Ming Dynasty, such as in chapter 55, which records the text being changed to Manchu, there should have been at least some sentiments or the like, but other than "and the customs have also undergone a major change," he said nothing. Finally, he praised the alien rulers and their meritorious dogs: "Since then, General Yang's prestige has become increasingly prominent, and the soldiers on the sea (referring to the soldiers of the Ming Prince Yiyang) dare not invade the territory, and the people have once again enjoyed peace." The author completely forgot about the insane massacre a few months ago! People like Qifeng Qiaodao Ren, who are so willing to live in peace and forgetful, are probably not uncommon now. Perhaps someone would pull him in and consider him a confidant from more than 200 years ago. To avoid this bad influence, it depends on the reader's sense of proportion. In the same series of books, its value is several times lower than "The Painful History."

### Please—

— Lin Zhiguang

Please bring me that gun, comrade!

This gun, this bayonet, accompanied me at dusk.

In just a moment, I will be leaving it,

Let me stroke it once, just once!

Please write a letter home for me,

Tell my elderly mother:

The enemy's bullet hit my chest,

Please don't grieve for me, don't grieve.

Please sing a song for me again,

Like the one we sang before we set out:

Cross over the bodies of the martyrs and advance,

Step on the blood of the martyrs and advance!

Please don't remember me anymore,

Remembering a dead person is useless!

Please remember the enemy's cruelty,

A great hatred, to be avenged on the battlefield!

Now I am smiling,

Look, I am smiling!

### A Comparison of the "Four Great Dan Actresses" in Peking Opera (Part 1)

— Xuehong Zhaizhu

Peking Opera actors have always been divided into four roles: "Sheng, Dan, Jing, Chou." In the past, there were many talented actors in the Sheng role, and they often performed as the main characters, so they had an extraordinary status. However, since the Republic of China, the Sheng role has gradually declined. The older generation are either old or dead, and very few younger actors have emerged. In addition, Mei Lanfang's sensational performance in the Dan role, followed by the emergence of Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, Shang Xiaoyun, Xu Biyun, and Zhu Qinxin, although the name is still the same as "Sheng, Dan, Jing, Chou," in fact, the status of the Dan role is far above the Sheng role. Among them, Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, and Shang Xiaoyun are particularly accomplished, and they have earned the honor of being the "Four Great Dan Actresses" in the Peking Opera world. As for the art of the four of them, various circles have long made their assessments. Now, I will comment on them based on my personal views. If there are any errors, I hope that drama experts will correct them.

Mei Lanfang

In the past, he was respected as the "King of the Performing Arts World." After traveling to the United States, he was even awarded the honorary title of "Doctor of Literature." This favored one of heaven is enough to be proud of in the performing arts world. As for his art, he does have many unique features. In addition, his natural talent is sufficient, which has given him a lot of help. Now, let's observe his singing and acting aspects: His voice belongs to the Gong tone, which is broad, bright, and sweet, and very pleasant to listen to. In addition, his speaking and reciting are clear and crisp, and his Beijing dialect is fluent, so it is no wonder that he is so popular. As for his acting, it is graceful and generous, without any procrastination. Moreover, his appearance is delicate and beautiful, and his expressions are subtle. He can understand the plot everywhere, and every move is just right. It is certainly not a coincidence that he is the leader of the Dan role!

Cheng Yanqiu

The voice is the capital of a singer, and Yanqiu suffers from this capital. However, smart people have their own methods. He abandoned the dead singing without a voice and worked hard on the tune. As a result, he became very popular in this "Cheng tune." It can be seen that everything in the world depends on human effort. Yanqiu's voice belongs to the Shang tone. When he sings, it is as high as a monkey's cry and as fine as a gossamer, which is both sad and moving. In addition, his appearance is pure and beautiful, and his actions are upright, which is most suitable for playing tragic Dan. Moreover, his stage steps are very steady and skillful. It is said that he walks in a T-shape, so his small feet are never exposed outside his skirt. This kind of superb skill is probably not something that ordinary vulgar actors can pay attention to. In addition, his beauty in the running garden scene, his skill with water sleeves, and his deep skill with the buttock pad are all beyond the reach of others. Therefore, Yanqiu is the only one who can compete with Lanfang.

### Recent News from the Silver Screen

— (Qiuwen)

The Twentieth Century Company has decided to produce a full-color historical film with all children as actors in its 1939 new film program. The script is based on the great deeds of King Louis XIII of France. The film is titled "The Red Sable." Minium Mink Company has prepared to use all its efforts to produce the film and participate in the International Film Exhibition held in Paris this autumn. However, child star Shirley Temple will not participate in the film.

After being ordered to close down by Hitler in 1936 for producing anti-fascist films, the German Dengbao Film Company reopened last spring and produced the martial arts film "The Red Knight." Because it was a box office success, it was produced from the first episode to the fifth episode, and the profit reached 5 million marks in mid-October. Recently, it was once again nationalized by the German government. It is now engaged in the production of "Son of the Iron Man." After the film is completed, it will be used as an annual international propaganda exchange item for the Allied countries (naturally Italy and Japan).

Tolstoy's posthumous work "The Dwarf" has been adopted by the British Gaomeng Company as a script, and with the consent of the Soviet government, it will be filmed on location in Russia. Some of the actors are planned to be recruited from Russian film actors. In order to appeal, the Soviet People's Committee will provide practical assistance at that time. It is still the first precedent for the British and Russian film industries to shake hands.

The war newsreel "Madrid and Spain," jointly produced by Paramount, Universal, and United Artists in Spain, has completed 120,000 feet since it began filming and has been shown in the United Kingdom and the United States for as long as seven months. Recently, it was decided to trim and reorganize the newsreel, divide it into two parts, and ship it to various countries in the Far East for public screening this spring. It can go from China to India and other places in March.

In early November last year, US President Roosevelt held a private banquet at his presidential residence for film producers across the country. Roosevelt delivered a speech to the producers at the banquet, hoping that each company would produce more scientific films starting next year to serve as extracurricular reading materials for students. All scripts will be collected by the Ministry of Education and provided free of charge, he said.

### A Record of the "Diao Chan" Vocal Performance

— Xin Ren

Many literati and artists gathered at the Diao Chan Teahouse the night before for a grand banquet and a vocal performance. The event was hosted by Fan Songfeng and Lu Yifang, who invited guests. At the same time, it was a banquet to introduce Ms. Zhou Meiyan, a Kunqu opera actress, to literary friends.

That night, a grand banquet was held, with many distinguished guests, no fewer than sixty people. Literary and artistic figures such as Ding Muqin, Zhang Xiaoyan, Wu Guanli, Zhou Lianxia, He Zhushi, Chen Lingxi, etc., were all outstanding talents of the time. Female guests: Gu Han, sisters Tan Jinlin, sisters Weng Hongsheng and Yu Ying, Liu Qinxin, Wang Xueyan, Pan Xueqin, Zhu Junpei, etc., were mostly famous artists in the singing world.

At the banquet, wine glasses were exchanged, the atmosphere was lively, and laughter was like pearls. The veteran actor You Yunqing played a melodious flute. First, the host, Fan Songfeng, sang a piece of "Pipa Ji." In the past, he taught at Jinan University and presided over the Kunqu opera lectures for a long time; his performance of famous family tunes was extraordinary, and the whole audience tapped their fingers in time. Ye Yangwu, a famous Kunqu opera amateur, continued with a section from "Making a Scene at School," which was also very good. Zhang Xiaoyan, a famous Peking Opera critic, sang four lines from "Scolding Cao" in the original rhythm, which was accurate in pronunciation and full of Tan's style. Ms. Liu Qinxin's long section of "Farewell My Concubine" imitated Wan Hua and showed great skill. Next, famous Kunqu opera artists Gu Chuanjie and Zhang Fufang took turns playing the flute and singing a section from "Pipa Ji" and "Thinking of the Mortal World," respectively, which was a perfect combination. Ms. Zhou Meiyan and Fan Songfeng and Tang Yunshang sang a section from "Small Banquet" and "Farewell Kiln" each, which were excellent in both Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera. Yu Ru Tang Yunshang's style of Qi Qilin, singing and acting "Chasing Han Xin," Wang Xuechen's dignified "South Tianmen," etc., also had their own merits and won a lot of warm applause.

The gentlemen and ladies who participated in this grand event each prepared a gift to present to Ms. Meiyan to show their encouragement and to help her enjoy the elegant atmosphere. For a time, they were displayed all over the table, with all kinds of items, which were beautiful. Ms. Zhou Lianxia specially painted a pine and plum blossom frame and inscribed it with the following short sentences: "Since making a home with the green pine, shadows slant in the incense of the jade furnace, rouge is used to dye the pen that pities talent, carefully writing the first flower of the east wind." The three arts of poetry, calligraphy, and painting were combined, which added even more color.

The vocal performance was lively enough.

### Wang Xueyan Zhou Lianxia

The banquet ended near ten o'clock, and it was indeed an unusual grand elegant gathering.

### Xia Peizhen Stops Returning to Shanghai

— Mu Mu

Three Theaters in Beiping Compete to Hire Her

Xia Peizhen, with the "Kuide Society" drama troupe, performed at the Beiyang Theater in Tianjin. It is said that the results were not very good, and Xia Peizhen also resigned from the troupe due to her weak body and inability to adapt to the local climate. She will sell off and return to Shanghai. This matter was recorded in the newspaper on the 15th. Yesterday, someone close to Xia Peizhen returned to Shanghai from Tianjin and talked about it, saying that the so-called inability to adapt to the local climate was all false. The poor attendance was a fact. At first, she sold 70-80% of the tickets, but then it gradually declined. On the most miserable day, there were only 22 tickets. The highest ticket price was 70 cents, how could that be enough for expenses? Xia Peizhen did not adopt a revenue-sharing system but took a monthly salary, but under these circumstances, there was also a sigh of "it is difficult to continue," so she had to use her inability to adapt to the local climate and her body as an excuse to resign from the troupe. At the same time, the "Qing Le," "San Qing," and "Kai Ming" theaters in Beiping heard this news and believed that Xia Peizhen had performed a free play in a certain entertainment center in Beiping when she came to Beiping with the Mingxing Company to film "The Love Story of Laughter," and the magic power was quite great. This time, hearing that she was going back to Shanghai, they believed that the opportunity was no longer there, so they each sent people to Tianjin to contact her and asked her to perform in a short-term performance on the first day of the Lunar New Year. After leaving Tianjin, there is plenty of time to rest, and the box office of the Lunar New Year will not be bad, not to mention it is a short-term performance. They are currently proceeding separately, and I don't know who will "get there first." It seems that Xia Peizhen will not return to Shanghai for the time being.

### News from the Pear Garden

The first day of charity performance by the Shanghai Performing Arts Association was held at the Ling Gong Stage yesterday. The attendance was full, and the situation was very grand. The performances of the actors were very wonderful. Zhou Xinfang arrived backstage early. Lin Shusen and Zhang Wenqin finished performing the play "Jiang Duo Dou" and chatted with Zhou for a long time, calling Zhou the leader of the performing arts world and unanimously supporting him.

The rehearsal of "Five Books of Zhang Guolao" at the Tianchan Stage is scheduled to begin on the 23rd (next Monday). It will be directed by Zhang Defu, the director of the play. The content includes the three plays "White Peony" and "Chopping the Vine Bridge," which are quite wonderful. The roles are assigned to Xiao San Mazi as Lu Dongbin and Xue Youqin as White Peony.

Opening Method Sixth Game

Black First

Screen Horse vs. Center Cannon (Straight Chariot Method)

Explanation of Moves

Chariot Two Advances Six or Advances Four are both official moves, but the intentions are different. Advancing Four is not aimed at charging forward, so it seems not as effective as directly Advancing Six for attacking the center. Pawn Five Advances One attacks the guard, Guard Four Advances Five covers, Cannon Two Advances One is a key move, which can resist the pressure of Chariot Two Advances Six. Pawn Five Advances One sends the pawn. Whoever wants to attack the center must first send out the center pawn, and then borrow strength to send out the horse. Chariot Two Moves Three to catch both seems to gain the initiative on the surface, but in fact it loses the initiative. This is called a false initiative. Horse Seven Advances Five to capture the chariot. If the chariot retreats at this time, there is still no major problem. Cannon Five Advances Four is a move that loses overall effectiveness and weakens the momentum. Chariot Two Moves Three, change to Chariot Two Retreats Two. Although retreating the chariot is also an official move, Cannon Eight Advances Two protects the center, Horse Seven Advances Five forms a pinning horse cannon attack, Soldier Seven Advances One forms a screen horse defense.

### Art Forest Weekly Theater

Second Performance

After the performance of the three famous plays "Red Lantern," "Executioner," and "Third Master Liu" by the Art Forest Weekly Theater last Sunday, it received good reviews from the audience. The prosperity of the attendance broke the record of the previous Weekly Theater.

It is heard that the theater will still be held at the Carlton Theater this Sunday (22nd) morning. The names of the plays are (1) "Bright Moon Rises in the East" (written by Mrs. Arlai) (2) "Seeking Marriage" (written by Chen Baichen) (3) "People Riding Horses to the Sea" (translated by Tian Han). The three major plays have been rehearsed for three weeks. The director is a famous person in Shanghai. A string orchestra will participate in the accompaniment this time, conducted by Zhang Zhengfan. Those who love drama should not miss this good opportunity.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden in the Former Capital (80)

— Xu Muyun

Cui Ruisen Suffered Beatings from Fu Ying and His Descendants for Three Generations

To play the role of a "teacher master," the first requirement is to perfectly imitate the demeanor of one who bullies the villagers by relying on the power of others (to put it elegantly, leveraging influence like a fox). Only then can one add color to the play. Wang Shuanzi had a thin, long braid coiled into a circle on his head, two patches of headache plaster on his temples, a long robe half-buttoned and half-tucked, a metal health ball rolling in his palm. When he appeared on stage, he held his head high, pushed his stomach out far, furrowed his brow, and stretched his mouth wide, moving sideways like a crab to the edge of the stage. His expression made everyone laugh. Moreover, this old fellow was a versatile performer, adept in both martial and comedic roles. His boxing stances were indeed proper, and his recitation of the names of the Grand Hong Fist, Second Hong Fist, and the eighteen weapons was clear and fluent. As for the crispness and brightness of his voice, no one could match it.

Cui Ruisen's performance, though not excellent, was still passable. He had even performed with the elder Tan in the past. Several years ago, when Fu Ying performed "Killing the Fishing Family" at the Kai Ming Theater in the foreign concession, Wang Youqing played the role of Guiying. I had the opportunity to watch it. Cui Ruisen was almost sixty years old then, and the weather was very cold. When he played the teacher master being beaten and scolded by Xiao En, he half-seriously, half-playfully took advantage of his age and seniority to say to Fu Ying: "Your Tan family has really bullied me, Cui, thoroughly! Your grandfather started beating me, and I didn't mind that. But how can you call me 'Second Uncle'? The more I associate with your Tan family, the lower my seniority becomes!" Before he could finish his sentence, Guiying's board struck his buttocks. Ruisen then said to Youqing: "My buttocks are used to being beaten by your grandfather. Fine, I'll go find Wang Yaoqing to settle the score!" (Note: Youqing inherited Yaoqing's role; Yaoqing used to play Guiying opposite the elder Tan).

Anecdotes from the World of Medicine

### Always Maintaining an Authoritative Position. What is the Reason? It is Because: Proven Through Difficult Animal Experiments (This is an Advertisement)

— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Faculty of the Russian Labor University

### Testicular Endocrine Can Indeed Save from Premature Aging

That humans cannot live forever is indeed regrettable. However, the progress of medical science today is advancing rapidly. Although research on the art of immortality has not yet matured, a method for preventing premature aging in humans has already been discovered.

Among all anti-aging remedies, the most noteworthy is the testicular endocrinology advocated by Dr. Meulen. Dr. Meulen first conducted experiments on white rabbits. When white rabbits reach about five years of age, their bodies begin to decline, their appetite decreases, they walk with difficulty, and their fur becomes sparse, showing a state of weakness. At this time, he extracted the essence of the testicles of young animals and fed it to them. As a result, their spirit recovered and became lively, their appetite increased, their fur became shiny and dense, and their health was restored, thus achieving the goal of returning to youth.

Based on the same principle, this research developed rapidly. As a result, it was decided to extract large amounts of endocrine from the testicles of chimpanzees, cattle, and sheep, and to incorporate ingredients beneficial to the human body such as minerals and plants, to create the drug PANticome (Buti Kang). It has achieved very great success in treating premature aging.

Premature aging in the human body is entirely caused by excessive indulgence and violation of physiological life, such as excessive licentiousness, excessive labor, addiction to masturbation, or nocturnal emissions. The symptoms include pale complexion, listlessness, muscle wasting, frequent feelings of heaviness and headache, palpitations, night sweats, and insomnia and forgetfulness.

If a patient with premature aging is treated with the testicular endocrine agent "Buti Kang," it can certainly cure the patient. However, if the lifestyle is not brought back to normal and one continues to be licentious and masturbate, it will still be ineffective.

"Buti Kang" is a metabolic agent that is especially beneficial for the elderly. After prolonged use, it does indeed have the effect of restoring youth. Women can also take "Buti Kang."

The white rabbit in the picture above had already lost its fur and was extremely aged. After being fed with testicular endocrine by the German physiologist Dr. Meulen, its spirit became lively and its appetite increased. Its full and shiny fur is sufficient proof of the omnipotence of medicine.

### The Perilous Signs of Increased Frequency of Nocturnal Emissions

— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany

Although nocturnal emissions are harmful, if the frequency is not high, or only occurs once a month, it may not be necessary to treat it. However, if the frequency gradually increases, the essence and blood will be depleted, the function of metabolism will gradually decline, and as a result, the brain nerves, sexual nerves, and spinal cord will be greatly damaged. All the symptoms of weakness will then arise.

After the frequency of nocturnal emissions increases, one can quickly perform local cold water friction and take French "Neris Nocturnal Emission Pills" to stop it. The "Neris Nocturnal Emission Pills" also have the effect of calming the brain nerves, and are very effective for treating insomnia. The thoroughness of its medicinal power is indeed unmatched by similar preparations. In the event that nocturnal emissions have already caused neurasthenia, sexual dysfunction, and back pain, taking the animal testicular essence preparation "Buti Kang" daily is very effective. In addition, electrotherapy and injections are also effective treatments for the above symptoms, but their efficacy is not as good as actively taking "Buti Kang." Because "Buti Kang" contains three ingredients, it does indeed have the three major functions of nourishing the brain, nourishing the kidneys, and nourishing the blood, so it can gain the trust of doctors, and is recommended as the best among endocrine agents.

Modern Medicine

### The Husband After Contracting Leukorrhea

— Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States

Marital love is often destroyed by leukorrhea.

Married men and women must be cured quickly.

After contracting leukorrhea, one must pay close attention to the development of gonorrhea. There are two reasons for this: one is to ensure the safety of one's own illness, and the other is to prevent the wife from contracting leukorrhea. However, these two conditions have a profound contradiction. Because if leukorrhea is not cured in a short period of time, it will inevitably turn into a chronic condition. Once it becomes chronic, if a good treatment method is still not obtained, one must lead a long-term life of abstinence. Mentally, one cannot avoid becoming depressed or overly excited. However, if one is married, it is often difficult to live a monastic life of abstinence due to environmental reasons. As a result, the wife will inevitably be poisoned.

According to statistics from various medical experts, among venereal disease patients, gonorrhea is the most common, and those who become infertile due to venereal disease are also mostly gonorrhea patients. This is especially important for husbands who have contracted leukorrhea to pay attention to. Originally, gonorrhea is extremely difficult to cure. If one indiscriminately takes medicines on the market that claim to be able to eradicate the disease in three to five days, or if the ingredients of the medicine are still very old but are given a new name, the so-called "changing the soup but not the medicine" refers to this type of trickery. And the result is not only not effective at all, but the gonococci penetrate deep into the internal tissues and blood from the local urethral mucosa of the urethra. When a man contracts gonorrhea, the testicles are damaged. When a woman contracts gonorrhea, the ovaries are destroyed. Therefore, the vas deferens and fallopian tubes of men and women are destroyed and cannot perform reproductive work, resulting in a tragic situation for the couple. To save this kind of pain, only "Klinon," invented by a German gonorrhea expert, can do the job. Because "Klinon" has the effect of resisting gonococcal bacteriophages, its eradication of gonococci adopts a surrounding method. Therefore, gonorrhea that has been cured after taking "Klinon" has never recurred. This is the unique efficacy of "Klinon" in treating gonorrhea. All men, whether married or unmarried, can only take "Klinon" to have no regrets.

### A Warning to Those Suffering from Lung Disease!

— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang

If a lung disease patient suddenly experiences hemoptysis or blood in the sputum, the patient and their family will be greatly shocked, thinking that their life is hanging by a thread. In fact, although there are many dangers, if the patient can remain calm and composed, and wholeheartedly trust the doctor's diagnosis and treatment, the danger can be turned into safety. In fact, lung disease relies entirely on appropriate treatment, and taking the lung disease specific medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" internally will definitely have excellent results.

Originally, this preparation is made by collecting the main ingredients for killing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It can eradicate all pulmonary tuberculosis, promote appetite, and invigorate the body's metabolic functions, so it has great efficacy in treating colds, whooping cough, and senile phlegm and asthma.

### Self-Treatment for Stomach Problems

When people have stomach problems, all nutrition deteriorates, such as vomiting, acid reflux, loss of appetite, and severe pain. To seek a radical cure, it is advisable to modify the stomach function. Gastric disease can be cured well, and the world has proven that it can be radically cured in a short period of time (available in Asia, Chinese and Western pharmacies).

Gonorrhea Lecture
— Stated by Doctor Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

### What Method Can Cure Cystitis?

Changes in Symptoms: The inflammation of gonorrhea most easily invades the inner urethral opening from the posterior urethra, and affects the adjacent bladder mucosa, and further invades the remaining bladder parts, thus causing cystitis. Patients feel frequent urination. Pain when urinating and turbid urine, high fever, and loss of appetite. General discomfort. Only those who suffer from pure acute cystitis urinate once every one or two hours, or even once every two or three minutes, so they cannot sleep peacefully at night, resulting in insomnia and unbearable suffering. In addition, the upper part of the pubis and the perineum also feel pain, especially after putting suffering powder into the urethra. The pain of cystitis is not limited to this. Often after urinating, it is followed by blood drops. This blood drop is called Terminal Haematurie, so the treatment of this disease should never be local therapy. For example, a ready-made medicine that claims to cure the disease in three to five days will not work, because the scope of this cystitis is very large, and the gonococci have scattered in all directions, so it is difficult to eliminate them in one place.

Effective Treatment: After years of careful exploration of various treatments for cystitis, I know that this disease can only be treated with oral "Klinon" to stimulate the body's cells and produce an anti-gonococcal toxin to phagocytize gonococci and then eliminate inflammation, reduce swelling, and promote diuresis. On the one hand, agile surgery is adopted, and German static electricity therapy and X-ray electrotherapy are used in conjunction to exert the power of destruction. Then acute gonorrhea can be cured in two or three weeks, and chronic gonorrhea can be completely cured within five weeks.

Clinic hours are from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. From today onwards, 20 patients are sent to the clinic every day, and each number only costs 5 jiao.

Spring and Autumn

### Three Poisons

— Yan Gong

Someone said: "Wherever the Japanese flag goes, the spread of drugs closely follows." These so-called drugs, of course, only refer to opium, morphine, heroin… and so on. In fact, under the cover of the rising sun flag, is there any place that is not filled with opium dens, gambling dens everywhere, and brothels everywhere? One can say that the three poisons are all present.

"Opium dens," "gambling dens," and brothels represent the local prosperity, and are also the easiest way to extract wealth. But in reality, the greatest and highest achievement lies in destroying the national consciousness and lofty aspirations of the general public; and in creating the degenerate concept of shamelessness and lack of integrity in the general public. To the extreme, it can make demons and beasts everywhere. Then those self-proclaimed masters will drive and employ them at will, and no one will resist anymore, and no one will have the strength to resist anymore. The plan is indeed extremely brilliant! Extremely evil! Extremely poisonous!

In order to promote the three-poison policy, the so-called puppet regime also obeys orders respectfully, and in fact uses this as the only way to support themselves. Recently, a report载:"The Wen Shui County Office of Jin Province issued an instruction, the first character number, ordering the village chief and deputy of Nanxian Village. Regarding the instruction, it was found that the brothel in Hejia Alley in the city was originally set up to maintain good people... Recently, by order of the Imperial Army, the number of people must be increased within three days. There is no other way. It is now stipulated that in addition to the selection and delivery from the city gate, each village with more than 300 households shall select and deliver one prostitute, with the standard of being around 20 years old, having no diseases, and being quite attractive. It must be sent to the county within the fastest time for inspection and acceptance. All treatments are provided by the Maintenance Association for each person per month with 50 catties of flour, 5 sheng of millet, 2 catties of kerosene, and more than 100 catties of black charcoal, and one ocean yuan is given to one person at a time... The matter is urgent and must be handled quickly. If there is any delay, I am afraid there will be inconveniences. Do not neglect it, the knowledge of the matter, Song Yuying." This is truly an unprecedented and wonderful instruction, and it is also an immortal achievement of the pseudo-government under the pseudo-public office.

Naturally, in the near future, the puppet government can also create several public "opium dens," "gambling dens," and "brothels," and instruct all villages and towns to promote them universally. Then the "three poisons" will be successful, and demons and beasts will be very happy.

### Old Stamp Market

— Xin Meng

If you walk south on Henan Road, this bookstore street, after passing the two major bookstores, Zhonghua and Commercial Press, you will see many old stamp stalls along the side of the road. A glass frame contains many old stamps, and several stamp albums are piled on the ground below. If a customer walks over, the person running the stamp stall will pick up the stamp album and let you choose. After bargaining, perhaps a deal will be made.

Originally, in this city of Shanghai, people who run stamp stalls are scattered on various roads and are not concentrated. There are not many people doing this business either. For some reason, the gunfire of January 28, 1932, actually made these people who run stamp stalls concentrate on Henan Road, and the number of people also seems to have increased. Perhaps many unemployed people are also using this business of selling old stamps to maintain their lives during this difficult time. In addition to Henan Road, there are also several stores selling old stamps on Jing'an Temple Road, Avenue Edward VII, and Avenue Joffre, but most of them are operated by foreigners, and the customers are of course mostly blue-eyed and yellow-haired.

We know that in European and American countries, many people like to collect old stamps. Even among kings and presidents, there are many who have a passion for stamp collecting. The late British Emperor George V loved stamp collecting the most, and the current US President Roosevelt also collects many stamps in his residence in Hyde Park. In addition, people from all walks of life, including business and academia, also like stamp collecting. As for the Chinese, they have never been very interested in stamp collecting, but in recent years, many people in Shanghai have suddenly become fond of collecting stamps, especially young students, and there are also many elementary school students. As a result, as the number of stamp collectors increases, the number of people selling stamps also increases day by day.

Because most of the stamp collectors are young students, the stamp market is concentrated on Henan Road, because most of the students often enter and exit Henan Road, buying books and stationery from Commercial Press, Zhonghua, or other bookstores, and then casually look at the stamp stalls. If they find a stamp they like, they buy a few back and paste them on their albums. Sometimes we can see young students or elementary school students taking a few stamps as samples and going to the stamp stalls one by one to match a complete set. However, most of the stamps that can be seen on Henan Road are common. There are not many rare ones. The price of each stamp is a few cents for the low ones, a few jiao for the expensive ones, and there are not many that are above a few yuan. Thinking of the overseas stamp market, a rare stamp can be worth tens of thousands of yuan, which is truly like a small wizard meeting a great wizard.

Since there are so many stamp stalls, where do these many old stamps come from? This is also a matter of interest. As far as I know, there are people who tear off the stamps from letters and take them to these stalls to sell. Among them, especially the Westerners in foreign firms are the majority, because they have the opportunity to collect envelopes in the wastepaper baskets and sell the foreign stamps one by one for money. The people who run the stamp stalls buy them, and after some sorting, they determine which one is valuable and which one is not. Those that are the same are arranged into complete sets and pasted on the albums, and then sold to customers for a few cents or a few jiao each, or a few yuan a set. Wholesale in, retail out, as long as someone comes to buy, of course you can make a lot of money. It is just that you must have a considerable understanding of old stamps, so as not to sell rare stamps at a low price without realizing it.

### Hunting for Old Books

— Ciyun

After the August 13th War of Resistance broke out, books suffered another great "劫 (robbery)". Not only were precious cultural heritages subjected to the "friendly" grace, but even more regrettably, they were cremated. Other complete volumes were scattered in pieces, and thus lost their original value. This is so regrettable! Therefore, assuming that someone who understands a little about ancient books can occasionally discover a rare or out-of-print book in the old book piles, and thus collect a part or several parts of ancient books, that would also be fulfilling a national duty in the work of preserving national essence. Although the national essence has qualitative advantages and disadvantages, we cannot let people take it privately to prop up their reputation.

Gunfire is diffuse in the sky above Shanghai, along the south side of the Suzhou Creek, by the Pontoon Bridge and the New Gate Road Bridge, many old book stalls are deployed in piles here and there along the road. Old goods stalls are filled with various kinds of books, Western-style, ancient-style, paper-bound, book covers; sizes of 16mo, 32mo, 64mo; English, Chinese, illustrated, literary, theoretical, translated, all kinds of content. These are mostly stolen from various bookstores, so the prices are still cheap.

In recent years, many newly emerging old bookstores and stalls have opened. The Culture Street, which has always been known for buying new books, has seen its book sales affected by various reasons since the start of the War of Resistance. Some bookstores have either shrunk their storefronts or moved inland to seek development. Therefore, it is the newly emerging old book stalls that are supporting the scene on the Culture Street. At one time, the Culture Street had a trend of one stall every ten steps. Recently, it has been reduced, probably to avoid obstructing the sidewalk. Several stall owners have gathered capital and jointly operate a half or one-room bookstore.

Around the area of Carter Road and Avenue Edward VII, old book stalls are scattered on the side of the road. Since the war, this place has become a concentration of large, medium and small schools, so business can really be done, especially during the school season, when students from various schools compete to buy textbooks. Since textbooks have been increased by 30% across the board due to the high cost of paper, textbooks on old book stalls have a trend of not being able to be found quickly.

The tastes of people who hunt for old books have changed with each passing year. Since the War of Resistance, books on social sciences have sold much better, which is a good phenomenon that should exist. Young people are making efforts to choose the most urgent and powerful field of knowledge.

Someone is willing to buy a copy of "Popular Political Economy" at a 30% discount, and a copy of "Lectures on Political Economy" with a torn cover for 8 jiao. Haggling is not business, books that are popular among these young people will not be cheap. Other old editions of "Iron Flow" and "Coal King", out-of-print "Cement" "Armored Train" "Destruction" these books are sold at the marked price; a book translated by Lu Xun and written by Karlsky "On Art", it is said that this book was initially banned. Except for the recent collection in the "Complete Works of Lu Xun", the original separate edition is not common. Someone bought it for a few cents; Engels' "Private Property and the Origin of the State", there are many people who want to find this book, but it is not easy to find on the market. Books about Shui Mo Bookstore are easy to find in the book piles. Shui Mo Bookstore was opened between 1929 and 1930, and its output of books was relatively advanced.

Some friends who run old bookstores use the service section of various newspapers to make non-expensive advertisements, publishing the catalog of his books. This facilitates people who hunt for books and saves time, and you can call him to deliver the books, the price is about the same. With this kind of relationship, he often brings books to your door for you to choose the books you love. If you entrust him to find books, he can also help you, which can save effort.

### Street Artists (Continued)

— Zhang Zhenshan

Embroidery: The main product sold by embroiderers is patterns embroidered with specially made thread and needles. The second is needles and thread. This specially made needle has a thread connected to one end, and a sharp hook at the other end. According to the pattern lines drawn on the cloth surface, it is sequentially passed through. Because the needle is pulled out, the end with the sharp hook will have a hooking effect. Therefore, the thread on the cloth surface can be inserted with a needle, and at the same time it can be pulled up from below, interacting with each other to form a pattern. It is said that large-format hanging scrolls can be embroidered; the daily income is also quite considerable.

Cutting Patterns: This is also a business mainly aimed at women. These patterns are mostly used on shoe uppers, handkerchiefs, and children's bibs. They are various flower and bird patterns made of white paper. Although the price is low, the daily income is 7 or 8 jiao. Skilled technicians can cut this kind of pattern without using a mold. A pair of scissors can twist a few twists on white paper to make a pattern. Those who are ingenious also have "aviation to save the country" patterns for sale now.

In addition, engraving seals, selling songs, and blowing sugar bubbles are also tricks to exchange skills for food on the street. However, these arts are not limited to the street, so they are omitted. Unemployed friends! Remember: If you have a skill, you won't starve. Go ahead and strive to be a lucky one in the tide of unemployment! "The End"

### Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later

— Ruhua

Produced by Xinhua Film Company, shown at the Jin Cheng Grand Theatre

A long, long time ago, I watched an American film "Just Imagine," which was an ideal film like "Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later." I can't completely remember the story, it seems that the new world fifty years later has developed to a new level, such as humans have abolished names and are called No, A, or B... Houses are high-rise buildings of dozens of floors, private airships are as numerous as cars are now, and food has been made into pills... Finally, it seems to be traveling to the moon, using photographic techniques to present the strange and bizarre new world to the audience.

Science is progressing day by day, and some parts of the "assumptions" in "Just Imagine" may be possible. However, because it is a fun film, it is inevitable to follow the "assumptions" of the screenwriter, and relying on superior equipment, it was made into such a sensational film.

"Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later" also has similar points, such as the free movement of airships, mechanical haircuts, psychological testing instruments, and even the ability to dominate the wind, rain, thunder, and lightning of nature.

The equipment of Chinese studios is naturally far inferior to that of Hollywood, so of course it cannot be compared with "Just Imagine." However, "Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later" was still completed before the war, otherwise even such a large scene would not be possible.

The script is slightly loose, and Han Lan Gen and Liu Jiqun's fear of their wives is too old-fashioned.

In short, "Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later" is just a fun film.

### Rain Clears to Blue Sky

Chapter Two: Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization, Director Jin Eloquently Discusses Equality

Miss Jin said, "Is it really possible for someone to enter the wrong room?" Lin Jiancheng said, "Because the layout of each floor is the same. When stepping out of the elevator, it's hard to tell which floor it is. I heard a story about a worker, a bachelor, who lived in room 14 on the fifth floor. Room 14 is very close to the elevator, just around the corner. One day after work, he had a few drinks somewhere and came back. He intended to return to his own room, but when the elevator stopped on the fourth floor, he mistakenly thought he was on the fifth. Stepping out of the elevator, the direction of room 14 was the same, and when he opened the door, the furnishings inside were very similar. Without thinking twice, he jumped into bed and began to snore loudly. When the owner of room 14 on the fourth floor returned, a newly married couple, they were surprised to find someone asleep on their bed. They pulled him up, but he was still confused, mistaking them for friends visiting him, and said in his sleep: 'Please sit down! Please sit down! Where did you good people come from!' Isn't that a perfect example of a standardization joke?" Lin Jiancheng's words made the two He sisters laugh uncontrollably. Miss Jin said, "There's a loophole in your story." Lin Jiancheng asked, "What loophole?" Miss Jin said, "Room 14 on the fourth floor and room 14 on the fifth floor would naturally have locks on their doors, and they would certainly lock them when they left. How could someone just casually push the door open and enter?" Lin Jiancheng said, "If I may add another point, that's also related to standardization. There are four or five hundred rooms in this building, and naturally all four or five hundred rooms have locks, but it's inevitable that some keys will be the same. Who knows if the keys to room 14 on the fourth floor and room 14 on the fifth floor are the same? Furthermore, the morals of the workers these days are much higher than before. It's common for them not to lock their doors. Look at those who live in large communal rooms, with many people living together, how can they lock their doors?" Just as they were talking, they arrived at the martyrs' cemetery. From afar, they could see a large white stone memorial archway with the four green characters "碧血丹心" [Loyal Hearts Shed Crimson Blood]. Looking through the archway, they saw that both sides of the path were lined with pine and cypress trees, which, although not very tall, already presented a verdant sight. This place was once used as an airfield during the war. Now, however, there was a small market, which thrived on the proximity of the martyrs' cemetery. Because people new to Shanghai often come here to pay their respects to the martyrs, and especially during the spring and autumn, many people come here for outings. (17)
