Xingning: After Japanese troops landed at Nantou, Bao'an, they were repeatedly attacked fiercely by Chinese forces, suffering heavy casualties and huge losses. For several days, more than 150 corpses were transported to the vicinity of Shenzhen for cremation, while the wounded soldiers were sent back to Japanese warships. (20th dispatch)

Wengyuan: Japanese troops who have occupied Shenzhen have been constructing fortifications to guard against Kowloon for several days. (20th dispatch)

Hong Kong: The local authorities consider it serious that the Japanese military spokesman in South China stated, "Since the British side continues to assist the Chinese side, the Japanese side finds it necessary to blockade the periphery of Kowloon," because most of the fresh food here comes from mainland China. (20th, Associated Press dispatch)

Hong Kong: The authorities are actively deploying various wartime facilities in Hong Kong, and all truck drivers, whether unemployed or not, must be registered. (20th dispatch)

Hong Kong: According to foreign news, the US President is planning to redistribute the Pacific Fleet in order to enhance the US position in the Far East when Japan takes retaliatory measures against the US for abolishing the treaty. It is further reported that the US will allocate some warships to be stationed at British and French naval bases close to China.

Hong Kong: The Japanese army in South China declared that the Japanese army has seized the border line of Hong Kong, and if Britain does not stop its aid to China, Japan will blockade the area around Hong Kong. (20th Special Dispatch)

Tokyo: Today, a military spokesman here declared that the Japanese army in South China feels that if Britain continues to aid the Chinese government, it will have to isolate Hong Kong from mainland China. The spokesman expressed regret for any inconvenience this may cause to the citizens of Hong Kong, but said that as long as Britain does not stop aiding the Chinese government, this Japanese action is difficult to avoid. The spokesman also stated that in the area of Shatoujiao, a British border area occupied by the Japanese army on August 17th, there is a newly built automobile highway between Menjiang (transliteration) and Sanshui in mainland China, and military supplies and other goods are imported into mainland China from Hong Kong along this road.

If Britain tries to compromise with Japan again, Singapore will also be threatened by Japan. (20th, Associated Press dispatch)

### If Chinese Troops Are Resolved to Counterattack, They Will Certainly Gain an Absolute Advantage: Opinions of Foreign Military Experts; Generalissimo Chiang Is Busy Preparing Air Force and Mechanized Units; A General Offensive Will Be Ordered When the Training of Three Million New Troops Is Completed

Chongqing: According to the opinions of Chinese observers, it seems unlikely that the Japanese army will continue to launch a large-scale offensive into the Chinese interior. The Japanese army will garrison key points with a small number of troops, while at the same time tightening the blockade of the coast and establishing the so-called "Federal Government" to undermine China's economic and financial system. The Japanese army will continue to carry out air raids on Chongqing, military bases, and industrial centers in an attempt to destroy the production efforts of free China. Today, the focus of the problem is whether the Chinese army has sufficient artillery, mechanized units, aircraft, and other weapons of war to take the offensive and achieve victory. Today, it is only necessary to recover any truly important major city or to defeat the Japanese army greatly to destroy the Japanese army's adventurous work. Since the fall of Hankou, all sectors of Chinese society have speculated whether the Japanese army will continue to advance into the interior, or be satisfied with obtaining the rich Yangtze River basin and various parts of North and South China at present, and then devote their energy to economic and political fields. Those who believe that the Japanese army will continue to advance into the interior think that there are three possibilities: (1) to attack northwest in order to cut off land communication between China and the Soviet Union; (2) to attack southwest, aiming to cut off railway and highway communication between China and Vietnam and Burma; (3) to attack directly west, aiming at Chongqing, the wartime capital of China. The various signs in the past ten months are sufficient to prove that Japan has decided not to expand its military activities in China, but to use economic and political methods to trap free China. The war against China's legal tender, the attempt to establish a so-called "Federal Government," Wang Jingwei's peace movement, and the large-scale withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Yangtze River basin are all sufficient to support the above-mentioned opinions. Generally, people believe that the success or failure of Japan's policy depends entirely on whether the Chinese army can take a strong and effective general counterattack. The Japanese military authorities believe that the Chinese army does not have this ability, so they are currently garrisoning the cities and towns along the Yangtze River with only a small number of troops, and their strength is particularly weak. According to the opinion of foreign military experts, if the Chinese army is resolved to launch a counterattack, it will certainly be able to recover all the cities and towns on the south bank of the Yangtze River from Hankou to Nanjing. However, this type of counterattack must be assisted by aircraft and artillery to be successful. The Chinese military authorities do not want to disclose their military plans at present. According to claims from all circles in China, it is obvious that Generalissimo Chiang has not ordered any large-scale counterattacks, but is preserving his military strength and weapons of war in order to use them for a major decisive battle when the time comes. It is heard that there are a total of three million new troops currently in training, in addition to the approximately 200,000 people who have already taken up arms. Generalissimo Chiang is currently busy training soldiers for the air force, artillery, and mechanized units. When these three million people have completed their training, and the air force, artillery, and mechanized units are all ready for action, Generalissimo Chiang will definitely order a general counterattack. As for where the Chinese army will launch this major attack, whether it will take the province of Shanxi to enter North China, along the Yangtze River in Central China, or in South China to attack Guangzhou, it is still too early to make this prediction now.

### Japanese Planes in Four Waves Raid Jiangxi; Shangrao Savagely Bombed Twice; Various Locations in Guangdong Also Bombed

Ji'an: Twenty-four Japanese planes, on the 20th, in four waves raided Jiangxi. The first wave of six planes flew over [blanks in original text], dropping several incendiary bombs, killing and wounding more than 20 people. The second wave of six planes patrolled the area around [blanks in original text]. The third wave of six planes invaded Shangrao, dropping bombs. The fourth wave of eight planes, at around 5 PM, passed through Fengcheng and fled towards Zhangshu, dropping several bombs before fleeing. (20th dispatch)

Shaoguan: Three Japanese planes, on the morning of the 20th, raided various locations in Guangdong, dropping bombs in counties such as Wengyuan and Lianping, and then raided Qujiang, dropping six bombs, killing and wounding one person each. (20th dispatch)

Shangrao: Fifteen Japanese planes, this morning, in two waves savagely bombed this place.

The second wave of six planes, at 2:15 PM, again fled to the skies above Rao, dropping more than ten bombs, destroying more than 100 civilian houses, and killing and wounding more than 100 innocent civilians. (20th dispatch)

Chongqing: Mr. Lai Bojun, a missionary with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, witnessed the situation of the Japanese plane bombing of Jiading southwest of Chengdu yesterday. According to him, a large fire broke out in the commercial area of Jiading after the Japanese planes dropped bombs, and the loss of property must have been very heavy. Furthermore, there are very few air-raid shelters in the Jiading area, and the city walls have not been demolished, so it is extremely difficult for civilians to evacuate after an air-raid warning is issued, so the number of casualties must also be heavy. It is heard that the only hospital in Jiading is the one established by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. The New Life Movement Headquarters in Chongqing has now dispatched two doctors and two nurses to provide medical assistance. As for Mr. Lai Bojun's witnessing of the Japanese plane bombing of Jiading, it was also accidental. When an air raid alert was issued in Chongqing yesterday, Mr. Lai Bojun happened to be at the airport of China National Aviation Corporation. In principle, the safest way for a commercial aircraft to encounter an air raid is to take off and patrol. Mr. Lai Bojun was able to board the aircraft and arrive in the sky above Jiading after the Japanese planes bombed it, and witnessed the bombing situation in Jiading. Also, Haikang, 40 miles southwest of Guangzhou Bay, and Lianjiang, 40 miles northwest of Guangzhou Bay, were also bombed by Japanese planes yesterday. (20th, Associated Press dispatch)

It is heard that government banks are now planning to establish more branches along the Yunnan-Burma Road to facilitate finance and commerce and assist in construction plans. It is heard that since the war, the number of Chinese banks has increased to 158, including overseas Chinese banks, of which 54% are located in East China, 11 are located in West China, 10 are located in North China, 8 are located in South China, 7 are located in Central China, 2 are located in Northwest China, and 8 are located overseas.

### General Feng Yuxiang Broadcasts: China's Dangerous Period Has Passed; The People Must Not Hesitate to Sacrifice and Endure Difficulties; Maintain Internal Unity and Carry Out the Mission of Resistance

Chongqing: Tonight, General Feng Yuxiang delivered a broadcast speech entitled "How to Strive for Victory and the Second Phase of the War of Resistance." Feng asked the people of China to not hesitate to make necessary sacrifices, to endure all kinds of difficulties, to maintain internal unity, and to carry out the mission of resisting Japan. Feng stated that today, China's chances of defeating Japan are greater than at any time in the past, while the difficulties of the Japanese army are increasing day by day. One is the decline in the fighting spirit of the Japanese army, the second is the increase in the anti-war sentiment of the Japanese army, and the third is the exhaustion of Japanese manpower. All of these are signs that Japan is bound to be defeated. However, there is no such phenomenon in the Chinese army. Feng stated that the cooperation between the army and the people is the main factor for military victory, but this spirit of cooperation is not accidental. If the people have no army, they will be completely trampled upon by others. If the army does not have the support of the people, its power will be difficult to exert. Therefore, the cooperation between the people and the army is an inevitable trend and a guarantee of victory. Feng further stated that China's dangerous period has passed, and what China needs from now on is to accomplish the mission of resisting Japan. Feng strongly condemned Wang Jingwei and his ilk, and said that during the current period of national crisis, everyone should take the interests of the nation and the people as a prerequisite, and should not undermine the war front with personal ambitions and desires for leadership.

Editorial

### The Future of Britain's Tough Stance

Seeing Britain floating and sinking in the adverse current, the world is sometimes worried and sometimes happy, unable to restrain itself. World opinion is sometimes praise and sometimes disparagement, and cannot come to a consensus. What will Britain do to deal with itself and the world? Who does not want to get to the bottom of it?

British Prime Minister Chamberlain, regretting that his actions were not understood by critics, once angrily said to his parliament, "Our painstaking efforts are often wantonly criticized by irresponsible people." How sad and angry his words are. However, judging by the momentary changes in worry, happiness, praise, and disparagement, it can be seen that the world, towards Britain and towards Chamberlain, did not initially have any preconceived notions that they must be spoken ill of. The reaction is like this, it is actually self-inflicted. Did you not see the scene after the surrender of Czechoslovakia? How can Chamberlain's so-called painstaking efforts be sought to be understood by people? Recently, for the issue of the Free City of Danzig, he repeatedly stated that he must fulfill his obligation to guarantee Poland. Yesterday, he further stated that he must avoid anything that smacks of mediation. Words of praise from all over the world came back unexpectedly. Did you not see the issue of the four suspects in Tianjin? As soon as the extradition was mentioned, it was not justified by world opinion, and public opinion in both China and Britain was in an uproar. However, for refusing to hand over the Tianjin savings to Japan and refusing to discuss the currency issue in the occupied areas, world opinion suddenly allowed it as a tough stance. Beneficial to the overall situation. All cause and effect; as the echo responds; worry, happiness, praise, and disparagement, are they accidental? The world has its own eyes and ears, and justice resides in the hearts of the people, and cannot be deceived. Can one not be awed, or can one know where to struggle.

Those who allow Britain's attitude to be tough and believe that it is beneficial to the overall situation: in addition to the Danzig issue and the Tianjin savings and currency issue, such as the recent increase in the army in the Singapore military port, such as the mobilization of warships in Hong Kong, not allowing the Japanese side to transport supplies in transit, and such as yesterday's widespread rumors of preparing to declare the abolition of the British-Japanese commercial treaty in response to the Japanese anti-British movement, these are all signs of toughness. While the situation in Europe is becoming more and more tense, the world believes that Britain may not be able to avoid yielding to the Far East, but now it is the opposite, which is a unexpected theme to praise Britain. Or not only that: such as regarding the four suspects, when it expressed its preparation to extradite, the critics believed that Britain had abandoned its traditional fairness, and abandoned its founding rule of law. But it meets the strong and violent, and nothing is unsacrificable, and it also contains shame and humiliation, and there is nothing to spare. However, based on the request of the people, London has already allowed the use of the "Habeas Corpus Act." This measure is not only about the safety and happiness of the four suspects, but also shows that the British government can still take care of fairness and respect the rule of law. The importance of this in meaning far exceeds the issue of extradition and non-extradition. As for the Tianjin savings and the currency in the occupied areas, from the beginning of the negotiations, it never hesitated to establish a so-called preliminary agreement. This form seems to be only seeking temporary peace, and nothing cannot be promised. Now it can resolutely reject unreasonable demands, indicating that the Tokyo negotiations have been stopped, or even completely broken down. This measure is not only enough to comfort the world with the savings and currency issue, but also shows that Britain can still maintain its national free and independent policy, and there is a bottom line for concessions and compromises. This is also an answer that those who have been seeking oppression of Britain have not discovered for a long time, and it is what those who cherish Britain are happy about.

Although, all the problems in Europe and the Far East still exist, and they have not ended because of Britain's ability to be tough. The meaning and value of Britain's tough stance have not been determined by today's stage. The world's praise of Britain is also based on the matter, just right, and cannot be relied upon as a constant. It must be clearly recognized that the encounter after the tough stance may be an intensification of oppression. Will Britain not repeat its knees because it cannot bear the oppression? Or will it be moved by the sweet words and heavy profits of temptation and delve into the trap? All these questions are not to say that they distrust Britain; only to believe that those who overcome such questions, rather than saying that they are tied to trust in Britain, are better said to be tied to Britain's determination in the future. The determination is where it is, and it is not enough to show a tough posture, and it is not enough to be satisfied with the effect of the tough posture; it must not hesitate to be difficult and dangerous, and not try to be lucky, and take the preparation and action of being tough as the backing of the tough attitude. Today's international community is not a competition of propaganda, not a competition of posture, but a measurement of interests and strengths. As a result of the measurement, we firmly believe that Britain has its own interests to protect, and has its own strengths to rely on; however, those who gamble with it are using the pain of the moment as a bet, and Britain must be prepared for a corresponding sacrifice. Although we suspect that the aggressors do not have the courage to open a dispute with Britain, as far as Britain is concerned, this is the basis for determination and the capital for determination.

The British authorities may think that they have always had determination, but the various signs in the past are not enough to be clear evidence of determination. We also sincerely hope to respect what the British authorities have declared and believe that they have always had determination, but the various signs in the past at least lead people to mistakenly believe that they are hesitant. The British authorities may think that the responsibility for the misunderstanding does not lie with Britain; however, in fact, other countries have failed to understand Britain's determination. The misunderstanding that Britain is hesitant has caused considerable damage to the dignity of the British state, the credibility of Britain in the international community, the material interests of British merchants in the Far East and elsewhere, and the feelings and friendship of China and several other nations towards Britain. This is what the British authorities should carefully examine in addition to handling determination and showing a tough stance. If it is said that being tough is only a posture, and it is not a determination; then the British authorities must have other determination: that is, those who oppress Britain, it is not that Britain takes a step back, or takes two or three steps back to be satisfied, nor is it any compromise in the British mind that they can be satisfied. Then, if Britain is still unable to abandon its intention of compromise and retreat when it shows a tough stance, it can only resolve to kneel down, withdraw its flag and stop its drums and return to the British Isles. Europe and the Far East are one and the same, and the situation is no different.

### Tianjin Water Shortage Reaches Emergency Status; British Concession Water and Electricity Supply Halted; Racecourse Road South Flooded to 18 Inches

Due to rising water levels, the supply of electricity and water to the British Concession in Tianjin was halted tonight. However, the French Concession still has electricity, so the British Concession is negotiating with the French Concession about connecting electricity. In the former German Concession, the water level reached three feet. Japanese sentries at the end of the racecourse also retreated due to the rising water. Furthermore, many areas within the Japanese-occupied zone were flooded, so many Chinese refugees carrying luggage and utensils entered the British Concession. The Japanese side was especially accommodating and did not obstruct them. At the same time, many of the milk sheds run by White Russians also moved into the British Concession, so the milk needed in the British Concession can be spared inspection by Japanese soldiers. There are also many other horses being transferred into the British Concession. The Japanese military road surrounding the British and French Concessions is now also in danger of being flooded, as the water level is only eight to ten inches away. The Asahi Road in the Japanese Concession was flooded today. (Associated Press, 20th)

The southern section of the Tianjin racecourse is already 18 inches underwater, so an emergency state will likely be declared tomorrow. The city's low-lying commercial areas are in immediate danger of being flooded. (Reuters, 20th)

The flood in the southern section of the Tianjin racecourse is spreading rapidly. The terrain there is relatively high, so the sudden flooding was quite unexpected. The British Concession power plant was flooded at 3 PM this afternoon, resulting in an interruption in the supply of electricity and tap water, causing great anxiety among the residents. Emergency arrangements are currently being made, hoping that the tap water supply can be restored. It is reported that the British authorities have contacted the Belgian power company supplying electricity to the French Concession to temporarily supply electricity to the British Concession. Today, no fewer than 50,000 refugees have fled to Tianjin. The British Concession Municipal Council has telegraphed the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Bowater, requesting him to raise funds to aid the refugees. Some of the wealthier refugees have come to Tianjin by oxcart or mule cart, carrying large amounts of furniture. In addition, a considerable number have come to Tianjin by boat. The Japanese sentries at the various checkpoints seem indifferent to these displaced refugees. Some Japanese soldiers are wearing rubber boots, while others have rolled up their trousers to their knees. The Japanese sentry posts are surrounded by thick earthen walls. At present, five or six hundred cattle have been transported into the concession, all in good health. Although there will be no problems with the milk supply thereafter, there is clearly not enough open space within the concession to accommodate this large number of livestock, which is a cause for concern. Several sections of the electrical grid around the concession have been submerged in water. People generally hope that the Japanese have turned off the electricity. Looking out from the end of Racecourse Road, several houses outside the concession can be seen partially submerged in water. A Reuters reporter patrolled along the border of the concession and saw that several low-lying areas had become a vast expanse of water. The French Concession authorities are currently working to strengthen the levees around their territory. Japanese engineers are also participating in the construction of earthen dikes to protect the Japanese Concession. (Reuters, 20th)

The residents of the British Concession in Tianjin woke up this morning to find their area still dry, but the area flooded by water from the ditches is gradually expanding. As far as is currently known, Special District One has not suffered serious flooding, because the water from the breach in the southern dike is flowing northwest, endangering the area near Nankai University. The new military road built by the Japanese on the high dike is now only eight inches above the water surface. The water level has risen only a few inches since last night, but the water has reached the mud wall built along the riverbank, so the Hai River now presents a magnificent view, resembling a large river. It is rumored that the former Russian Concession is deeply flooded, with some places three feet deep, but this has not been confirmed. The southern section of the British Concession, which has not been fully developed and still has many grasslands, is now almost a pasture, with cattle and horses grazing there. It is reported that the Japanese allowed cattle and horse owners last night to drive their livestock from the flooded area through the blockade into the British Concession, and also allowed some refugees to enter the concession. The disaster victims each carry the few items they can hold, mostly wading through the water, soaked below the waist, a truly pitiful sight. (Reuters, 20th)

### Huai River Rises Sharply; Anhui Dikes Collapse

The Huai River in a certain area of northern Jiangsu has risen sharply. The dikes in various places have not been properly repaired since the National Army withdrew to the west, making the situation very dangerous. Five sections of the dikes on the southern bank within Anhui Province have collapsed. (20th dispatch)

### Anti-British Movement Intensifies

According to news from Beiping today, the Japanese have established the so-called "Beiping Citizens' United Congress" here, with the aim of expanding the anti-British movement to various Asian countries. It is reported that those hoping to join as comrades are teachers, journalists, merchants, and workers and peasants. The inaugural meeting was held here today, passing various anti-British resolutions and requesting the "Beiping Provisional Government" to implement them. All movie theaters must screen anti-British cartoons before the start of the show. The cars of the British Embassy and other British people no longer display the British flag. At the same time, the Japanese also have an organization called the "Salvation Army" that sends letters to the servants of British expatriates, urging them to resign quickly, or they will be put to death. (Associated Press, 20th)

Hong Kong, 19th of this month, the Japanese Air Force aviation unit raided Leizhou (Haikang), the main city of the Leizhou Peninsula, twice at 9:30 AM and 10:00 AM. (Domei News Agency, 20th)

### Chinese Aircraft Fly to Yuncheng to Drop Bombs

On the 13th, the Chinese Air Force flew over Yuncheng and dropped many bombs, then returned safely. The Japanese in Yuncheng are now very panicked and have been holding air defense exercises for days, preventing Chinese aircraft from attacking again. (18th dispatch)

### Wartime Guilin Construction Plan

Chongqing, according to a telegram from Guilin, the capital of Guangxi Province, the area has drafted a "Wartime Construction Plan" and requested the National Government and the Guangxi Provincial Government to allocate one million yuan to build a new Guilin. Since the capital of Guangxi Province moved from Nanning to Guilin in 1937, all government agencies have been makeshift and temporary in nature. After the outbreak of the war, Guilin suffered repeated indiscriminate bombings by Japanese aircraft, and most of the buildings were destroyed. The current wartime construction plan drafted by the province is to build "scattered buildings" in the suburbs of Guilin to avoid major losses during bombing. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)

### Regarding the Tianjin Four Chinese Cases, Writ of Habeas Corpus Granted by British Supreme Court

London, Justice Cassels of the Supreme Court granted yesterday the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus regarding the four suspects in Tianjin, which will be returned for rehearing next Tuesday. At that time, the propriety of this application will be argued in the judge's office, and then it will be decided whether the writ should be issued. The petitioner will be represented by Sir Monckton, Attorney General of the Duchy of Cornwall, and the Crown will be represented by Sir Somerwell, Attorney General. According to this ancient British legal procedure to protect the freedom of the people, once the writ is returned, the propriety of the application will be debated, and then it will be decided whether the writ of habeas corpus should be granted. If the petitioner obtains this writ, it will instruct the person detaining the prisoner to hand over the prisoner to the British court or release him. (Reuters, 19th)

### A Brave Warrior of the New Fourth Army

Fights Seven Japanese Soldiers Alone, Suzhou Correspondent, several New Fourth Army soldiers arrived in Donggangjing, the border between Suzhou and Changshu, a few days ago. When they were about to set off for another place, a soldier named Wang was ill and unable to set off with them, so he stayed in the area to recuperate. He was then reported to the Changshu Japanese military headquarters by a local. After receiving the report, the Japanese army dispatched seven soldiers to surround and capture him. Fortunately, Wang's actions were extremely secretive. When the Japanese army arrived at Donggang, he had already left the place. The Japanese army searched fruitlessly, so they searched nearby. Unexpectedly, Wang had hidden in advance behind a tomb west of the town. Seeing the arrival of the Japanese army, he fired first. The Japanese army was caught off guard and immediately fought back. After less than fifteen minutes of fighting, Wang, taking advantage of the terrain, killed two Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers became more panicked and fled with the bodies. Wang, with one person fighting seven Japanese soldiers, can be called brave.

### Britain's Attitude Towards Japan is Firm, Policy Closer to U.S.; Japanese Anti-British Movement Unrestrained, Likely Forcing Britain to Abolish Trade Treaty

Paris, the French semi-official newspaper "Paris Soir" today suggested convening a conference of relevant countries to resolve the Far Eastern economic problem. The newspaper supported the British action in Tianjin and said that Japan has consistently refused to consider the conference method. However, if there is sincerity in avoiding the danger of conflict, the conference is indeed the only way to clarify the situation. (Reuters, 20th)

Washington, State Department officials here believe that Britain's hardening attitude towards Japan may be a sign that British aid to China has become more active than before. International experts here believe that the British claim that the silver issue and the circulation of legal tender must be agreed upon by other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty is extremely justified and sufficient. However, among the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, except for Italy, all oppose Japan, so it is highly doubtful that Japan will agree to the convocation of a conference of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. (Associated Press, 20th)

London, Foreign Secretary Halifax had just returned to Beijing on official business a few days ago and returned to his Yorkshire villa for vacation two days later. However, he suddenly came to London again today. A diplomatic problem reporter for the Sunday Dispatch recently commented on this matter, saying, "News from Tokyo claims that the negotiations between Britain and Japan have broken down. It is noteworthy that the Foreign Secretary returned to Beijing at this time. It is reported that the Tokyo negotiations were 'suspended' by the Japanese representative Kato. After discussing with the Army and Foreign Ministry authorities for several hours, he met with British Ambassador Sir Craigie and informed him of this intention. Diplomatic circles here originally thought that European countries are now conducting a 'war of nerves,' and Britain's attitude in the Far East may be weakened as a result. In fact, Britain is dealing with Japan with a firm attitude, which is fortunate for the diplomatic community." (Havas, 19th)

London, Britain adopted a new tough attitude towards Japan, which was endorsed by the British press yesterday, even by those newspapers that usually advocate appeasement in the East. According to people close to the Japanese Embassy in London last night, if the anti-British movement in China becomes more intense, Britain intends to abolish the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce as retaliation. Neutral observers believe that the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce is another indication of Britain's tough attitude towards Japan. Britain's adoption of this attitude is clearly an effort to make British and American policies in the Far East more harmonious. (Associated Press, 20th)

North China Japanese Army to Take Independent Action to Deal with Situation After Breakdown of Negotiations

Tokyo, according to Japanese semi-official sources, General Sugiyama, commander of the North China Japanese Army, conferred with various commanders today and decided to take effective plans to deal with the situation arising from the actual breakdown of the talks in Tokyo. The North China Japanese military authorities will take independent action to eliminate the "enemies" among the British authorities in China. It is reported that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin are now considering submitting a time-limited telegram to the British authorities regarding the Japanese financial demands in Tianjin, which includes handing over the Chinese silver deposits in the British Concession in Tianjin and prohibiting the circulation of Chinese legal tender. All sectors of the Japanese public feel that the complete breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese talks is imminent. (Reuters, 20th)

### Germany Does Not Eagerly Hope that Japan Joins Military Alliance

Fearing it Will Facilitate the Alliance of Britain, France and the Soviet Union, Contrary to Italy's Views

London, news here today that Germany does not eagerly hope that Japan joins the Italo-German military alliance. Although Italian Foreign Minister Ciano welcomed Japan's joining the military alliance, it is said that Germany fears that Japan's joining the alliance will increase the possibility of the Soviet Union signing a military alliance with Britain and France. It is reported that German leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop opposed Ciano's proposal to urge Japan to join the Axis powers' military alliance when they met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Salzburg and Berchtesgaden. Italy supports Japan's joining the alliance because Italy hopes to weaken Britain's naval position in the Mediterranean. (Associated Press, 20th)

### Japan Poisons China; Opium Mostly Comes from Persia

Washington, according to Anslinger, director of the U.S. Narcotics Bureau, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, opium production in China has been greatly reduced. In fact, no Chinese opium has been imported into the United States. As for the opium in the occupied areas of China, it is now mostly purchased by the Japanese from Persia and resold to Chinese for consumption, making huge profits. According to statistics, 3,300 boxes of opium were imported through Macau into mainland China last year. (Associated Press, 20th)

### U.S. Asian Fleet Strengthens Its Power; Six Submarines to Be Replaced with New Ones

Washington, according to responsible sources, six of the U.S. Asian Fleet's 800-ton submarines are of outdated construction, and the Navy Department plans to recall them next spring and replace them with six new 1,300-ton submarines. However, this does not mean that the U.S. Asian Fleet is being strengthened, as the older submarines in the U.S. Panama Canal Zone are also often replaced with new submarines. (Havas, 19th)

Manila, it is reported in naval circles here that the United States will send one battleship, several destroyers, and a submarine squadron to the Far East to join the existing Asian Fleet, while recalling several old ships to the country to improve their armament. (Associated Press, 21st)

### Canada Promotes Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement

Toronto, the Toronto City Council in Canada will pass an order next week instructing all departments of the city to purchase goods produced in the city to boycott Japanese goods. The order was proposed by Mayor McGregor during a discussion of taking action to refuse to buy German goods. (Associated Press, 20th)

### German Military Aircraft Forced to Land in French Territory

Verdun, France, a German military aircraft landed at 5:30 PM yesterday two kilometers from Montfaucon near here. Soldiers from the 155th Regiment of the Army stationed at the Verdun Fortress saw it and immediately arrested the German pilot and escorted him here to report to the superior officer. The pilot, named Heiner, claimed that he intended to fly from Hanover, Germany, to Wiesbaden, but lost his way and ran out of fuel, so he had to land. (Havas, 20th)

### Hungary in Dilemma, Internal Cracks Have Begun; Leader of Agrarian Party Advocates Neutrality, Foreign Minister Has Left Rome

Hungarian Capital City, Eckhardt gave an impassioned speech here today, stating that he has resigned as leader of the Farmers' Party, and said, "We must do our best to resist any threat to Hungary. The German theory that Hungary is included in their living space cannot be accepted. We have other valuable friendly nations besides Germany, whose interests are connected with ours." (Reuters, 19th)

Hungarian Capital City, Fekehart of the Hungarian Agrarian Party said in a speech to the party yesterday that we should not favor either Germany, Italy, or Poland, and should maintain friendship with the three countries. In the unfortunate event that war breaks out between Germany and Poland, we should not be involved in it under any circumstances. Since March 15, Germany has clearly attempted to drag all of Central Europe into its so-called German "living space." I dare to say on behalf of the Hungarians that Hungarians will not participate. (Associated Press, 20th)

Rome, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky flew from here to northern Italy today, not back to the Hungarian capital. He will stay in northern Italy for a short period of time and may leave the country on Monday. His conversation with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last night was extremely secretive. However, judging from the Italian side, the main event discussed was nothing more than Germany exerting pressure on Hungary, which Italy has been assisting. (Reuters, 19th)

Rome, it is rumored that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop again in the shortest possible time, and then return to Rome to hold talks with Italian authorities. (Havas, 19th)

Hungarian Capital City, well-informed sources here recently declared that Foreign Minister Csáky has left Italy for home and arrived in Graz this evening. He may return to the Hungarian capital tonight or tomorrow, but this information has not been confirmed. (Havas, 19th)

### Spain is Willing to Maintain Neutrality, Military Representatives Arrive in Rome

Madrid, Spain's foreign policy has not been officially announced since the end of the civil war, but judging from the current situation, Spain seems determined to avoid being drawn into the vortex of the European war. General Franco and other leaders have expressed their willingness to adopt a neutral construction policy. Madrid's important newspaper ABC reported that Spain has no ambition for adventure or aggression. (Reuters, 19th)

Madrid, the post of Commander of the Gibraltar Garrison, which was abolished by the Republican government, has now been decided to be restored by General Franco. Military circles here have interpreted it as not being opposed to Britain or to the country's occupation of the Port of Gibraltar. The area under the jurisdiction of the Garrison Commander is limited to the border between the Spanish mainland and British Gibraltar, and his duties are not mainly military, but focus on banning smuggling, especially the smuggling of tobacco and alcohol. (Havas, 20th)

Rome, a Spanish military delegation, led by General Triano, former commander of the Second Military Region, arrived here this afternoon. (Havas, 19th)

### de Valera to Visit the U.S. Next Month

### The Crisis in Danzig is Urgent; the Key to War and Peace Can Be Decided at the End of the Month; Diplomatic Contacts Between Countries are Very Busy; Hitler Again Advocates Direct Negotiations; Britain's Policy Decided to Prepare for Any Eventuality

London, according to the diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times, the cabinet will not make new decisions at the meeting on the 22nd of this month. Similar to the crisis last year, it is now beginning again. The British government's actions today will be different from last year, which is very clear. Last year, important policies were hastily decided when the overall situation developed. Today, there are already resolutions in place to deal with all emergencies. One of the most disturbing points in the overall situation is that German newspapers are now demanding the unconditional surrender of Danzig, which makes it difficult for Germany to retreat without losing face. Today, it is generally believed that the crisis will reach its peak before the Nuremberg Congress convenes on September 2. Hitler's speech in Tannenberg on August 27 may decide the issue of war and peace. It is now hoped that Hitler will be fully aware that Britain and France have decided to fulfill the guarantees they have made to Poland. Germany only considers that 80% of this is possible. Recently, those around Hitler mistakenly believed that before Britain and France could make any impression on Germany's western border, Germany would be able to destroy Poland. Thus, Germany could conduct a separate peace with the democratic countries. However, the formal Anglo-Polish alliance treaty currently under negotiation stipulates that Britain must not conduct a separate peace or truce with Germany, which can serve as an answer to the above arguments. (Reuters, 20th)

London, Foreign Secretary Halifax, who was originally on vacation in York, suddenly returned to Beijing this afternoon and immediately reviewed the reports of ambassadors stationed abroad, and paid attention to the report on the talks between British Ambassador Henderson and German Foreign Minister Weizsäcker. (Havas, 19th)

Berlin, according to reliable sources, leader Hitler recently met with Italian Ambassador Attolico and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at Berchtesgaden. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had previously proposed several suggestions and plans when he was talking with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Salzburg. As soon as Foreign Minister Ciano returned to Rome, Ambassador Codorico was summoned back to the country to report on his duties, and arrived in Munich only yesterday. He probably carried the Italian government's answer. However, the German official refused to express his opinion on this matter, insisting that he knew nothing. (Havas, 19th)

Munich, it is generally believed that Italian Ambassador Adoshago has now set off for Rome to report to Mussolini. It is rumored that Mr. Ado had an audience with Hitler to convey Italy's reply to the questions raised by the German side during the meeting of the German and Italian foreign ministers in Salzburg. It is said that this reply is quite unfavorable. (Reuters, 19th)

Rome, the outcome of the Danzig issue became more pessimistic at the end of this week. It is generally believed that Italy supports holding a conference to resolve the outstanding issues, so that a solution guaranteed by the four major powers can be obtained, and the turmoil can never be repeated. However, Germany and Poland do not believe in holding a conference, fearing that the conference will not satisfy them and will only damage their dignity. It is believed that Hitler made it clear to Ciano when he met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Salzburg that he could not accept a compromise solution, and that only direct negotiations between Germany and Poland could be beneficial. After Danzig is incorporated into Germany, Germany may not seek to provoke Poland again. However, fascist circles also have no illusions about the democratic countries' decision to oppose the invasion by force. It can also be seen from the consultations between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and military leaders that Italy is preparing for the outbreak of war. (Reuters, 19th)

Paris, French Ambassador to Italy Ponsot returned to Rome today after discussing with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet. He will visit Italian Foreign Minister Ciano on Monday. There is a rumor in Paris that Ponsot carried special documents to transfer to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, but reliable sources said that this statement has no basis. (Reuters, 19th)

### Germany and Danzig Increase Military Preparations

London: According to diplomatic sources, there are 400,000 people gathered between the Polish Corridor, Frankfurt, and Utrecht (US Associated Press, 20th).

Berlin: Saxony Province, near the northwestern border of German protectorates, is scheduled to hold large-scale mechanized troop exercises from September 10th to 18th. Roads in various towns reserved for army transport will now warn the public not to use them. Commercial conferences originally scheduled during this period have received advice to postpone or advance their dates (Reuters, 20th).

Berlin: Local newspapers recently reported that the German army will hold autumn exercises, and all highways leading to Bohemia and Moravia must be fully utilized by the army. All other people must obtain permission from the authorities to pass through them (Havas, 20th).

Berlin: Germany's recent military preparations are on a grand scale, and newspapers continue to fiercely attack Poland, but it seems that no immediate action has been decided. Rumors say that the Tannenberg memorial ceremony on August 27th has been canceled, and the annual Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress in September is also not planned to be held. However, the relevant authorities deny this, saying that the Tannenberg memorial ceremony has been prepared, and the speech by Führer Hitler will be broadcast everywhere by radio. Preparations for the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress have also begun, and invitations have been sent to foreign dignitaries. There is no cancellation or postponement of the above two events. Political figures also deny the rumors, saying that if the Nuremberg Congress is indeed canceled, it would be extremely serious (Havas, 19th).

Danzig: The authorities are now actively making military preparations. Trenches have been dug and barbed wire installed at the border between the city and Poland. Airfields and important strongholds near the city seem to have been equipped with anti-aircraft guns (Havas, 19th).

Danzig: The Deputy Speaker of the Danzig City Council presided over the inauguration ceremony of the new bridge in East Prussia yesterday. The bridge occupies an important position militarily. In his speech at the inauguration ceremony, the Deputy Speaker said that since 1920, Danzig has always been respectful and loving to Germany and its compatriots. Now, an invisible monument has been deeply engraved on this new bridge, with the inscription, "We eagerly hope to return to the motherland." This is clearly seen by the people of Danzig (US Associated Press, 20th).

### Italian Press Ridicules Poland for Negotiating with Germany

Rome: Local newspapers commenting on the European situation all say that the tension has reached its peak, and it is hoped that Poland can directly reach an agreement with Germany. The headlines they use either say, "The Danzig issue is enough to directly cause war," or "The European situation is increasingly tense," or "The seriousness and acuteness of the Danzig issue has reached its peak. If a solution is not sought quickly, it will fall into an irreversible situation." The Roman People's Daily reported, "The influence exerted on Poland by Britain and France is not without deception. For the sake of Poland, it should quickly get rid of it, and approach its western neighbors frankly and publicly, and establish an understanding with them in a spirit of loyalty and friendship. Only in this way can war be avoided. It is difficult to predict the outcome once a war starts." A journalist, Gaeda (known as Mussolini's spokesperson), published an article in the Italian People's Voice, stating, "A decisive period is approaching. The tension caused by the issues of the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor should not be allowed to drag on. Poland must decide whether it wants to use violence or reason." As it stands now, Poland should abandon Britain and France and not cooperate with them, but, based on the speech made by Führer Hitler on April 28th, re-negotiate with the German government on the issues of Danzig and the Polish Corridor. This, even if done at the last minute, is not too late. If it is resolute, then the issue constituted by the power of the German nation can be resolved, and Poland's independence can be guaranteed. That is, its rights to freedom and survival, as well as its great status that is budding, can also be respected. Wouldn't that be great? Time is pressing, and Poland needs to make a decision urgently. Otherwise, I fear it will be too late in a few days (Havas, 21st).

### Polish僑민 in the US Pledge to Defend the Motherland

New York: Polish僑民 in the United States have recently sent a telegram to the President of Poland, Mościcki, stating that there are 5 million Polish僑民 in the United States, all of whom are prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend the independence of their motherland (Havas, 19th).

### Japanese Christians Advise Hitler to Read the Bible

Bern, Switzerland: A local newspaper reported that a certain important Japanese figure recently traveled to Germany to investigate the situation of Christian churches. Afterwards, some Japanese Christians sent a Bible to Führer Hitler, with a letter attached, requesting him to read the Bible carefully, so as to clearly understand the mission of Christianity and no longer persecute German Christians. The Japanese government heard about this matter too late to prevent it in advance, but it has revoked the passport of this important figure so that he cannot go abroad again to conduct investigations (Havas, 19th).

### The European Situation is Serious: British Cabinet Members Return to London

London: Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to depart from Scotland this afternoon and arrive in London early tomorrow morning to preside over Tuesday's cabinet meeting. According to Reuters, Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, who is currently on vacation in Cannes, has departed today and will arrive here tomorrow, and will also attend the cabinet meeting. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax returned to his home in Yorkshire this morning and is scheduled to depart for London tonight (Reuters, 20th).

London: Although all departments appear to be extremely calm on the surface, they are very active internally. The sound of typewriters is incessant. Colonial Secretary MacDonald arrived at his department at 11:00 AM to work. Prime Minister Chamberlain is also scheduled to return to London from Scotland this afternoon and arrive here tomorrow morning. He will convene a cabinet meeting on the 22nd. Foreign Secretary Halifax returned to his country villa this morning and will return to London in the afternoon or evening (Havas, 20th).

London: Foreign Secretary Halifax's sudden return to London today has surprised many. Government officials commenting on this matter said that regarding the Danzig issue, Britain is now determined to fulfill all its commitments and prepare for all eventualities. Any actions involving mediation are resolutely rejected. After Sir Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, met with German State Secretary Weizsäcker yesterday, the report he submitted has been conveyed to the Polish government by the government. At that time, Weizsäcker attacked Poland extremely fiercely, and Ambassador Henderson immediately replied in a firm tone, stating that the British government is determined to fulfill all its commitments. This is the same as the attitude expressed by French Ambassador to Germany Coulondre to State Secretary Weizsäcker on the 15th of this month. As for whether Germany is still just engaging in intimidation or will act recklessly regardless of everything, it is difficult to determine at this time. However, according to recent intelligence from Germany, the country may launch an attack at any moment, and Britain should prepare everything to deal with it. According to reliable sources, Romania has once again stated that it maintains a relationship of solidarity with all democratic countries and has also stated that if Germany attacks Romania, it will destroy all oil mines to prevent them from being used by the enemy. This is taken very seriously here (Havas, 19th).

London: Britain's attitude towards the European situation is extremely firm, as can be seen from the comments of various newspapers. The foreign affairs correspondent of the Sunday Times declared, "Foreign Secretary Halifax, who was originally on vacation at his villa in Yorkshire, suddenly returned to London due to the increasingly serious European situation... Britain's position is very clear at this time and does not need to make new resolutions. In short, it is welcome for Germany and Poland to conduct direct negotiations, but if Poland goes to war with Germany, then Britain and France should help Poland. Military plans have already been drawn up and will take effect immediately, with no room for further delay." The political affairs correspondent of the Sunday Times also said, "If there is any further violence, similar to that inflicted by Germany on Czechoslovakia and by Italy on Albania, then Britain will definitely join the war." The Sunday Express reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to return to London from Scotland tomorrow evening and hold meetings with Foreign Secretary Halifax, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, and Secretary of State for Home Affairs Hoare. At that time, the ministers of the three departments of the navy, army, and air force may also attend. It is heard that the result of the meeting will be the issuance of various orders to prepare in a timely manner and deal with everything in the coming weeks. "In addition, the mutual assistance agreement between Britain and Poland and the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey can be signed and established within days. The British government will send new instructions by telegram to Sir Seeds, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, instructing him to step up negotiations and ensure that the political agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is established as soon as possible. As for Hungary, there is now talk of joining the alliance treaty between Germany and Italy. "Even if Germany obtains Hungary's consent to send troops into Hungary and use Hungary as a military base, if Poland believes that its independence is threatened, then Britain and France should implement their guarantee obligations and provide Poland with assistance (Havas, 19th).

### French People are Not Anxious

Paris: Informed sources here recently commented on the European situation, saying, "The political truce" has ended in the past week. Political figures said that although the general public knows that the situation is serious, they do not have anxious or fearful thoughts. All newspapers, including the far right and far left, which usually attack the government, are now unanimously praising the firm attitude of Britain and France. In addition, the general public knows that Germany's goal is not only to annex the Free City of Danzig but also to raise the entire eastern border issue for that country, and even to destroy Poland (Havas, 20th).

### German Finance Minister Goes to Rome

Berlin: German Finance Minister Krosigk left here last night for Rome and Florence, where he will stay for a few days. The purpose of this trip has not been ascertained, but senior officials of the Ministry of Finance, Dr. Schult and Dr. Gaylhoffer of the German Central Bank, are traveling with him, so there must be important matters to discuss (Haitong, 20th).

### Military Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Turkey

London: According to diplomatic sources, Turkey has agreed with the Soviet Union that once Turkey is attacked, Soviet land and air forces can enter Turkish territory, and at the same time, the Soviet navy can pass through the Dardanelles Strait (US Associated Press, 20th).

### Egyptian Military Representative Visits Turkey

Istanbul: An Egyptian military mission, led by General El-Azizi, arrived here today and was warmly welcomed. The mission will go to Ankara to consult with Turkish army leaders, study the Turkish military organization, and attend the final scenes of the Turkish army exercises in Antalya. The large-scale exercises are currently underway and are unprecedented in Eastern Thrace. Following the visit to the Turkish capital by former Egyptian Foreign Minister Ishia, the Egyptian military mission has now followed closely to hold military talks. Political circles here believe that this is of great significance. Commentators here say that Turkey and Egypt have joined the peace front and mutual assistance system and will join forces with Britain and France to act together as guardians of the Mediterranean (Reuters, 19th).

### US Observes No Immediate Change

New York: The major newspapers here are commenting on the European situation. Although they say the situation is becoming increasingly critical, the tone is still calm, which is quite different from the anxious situation in September last year when the Sudetenland issue caused a crisis. A Washington correspondent for the Republican New York Tribune reported that members of Congress and political figures are not overly anxious, and most cabinet members have gone on vacation. President Roosevelt is fishing off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, and Secretary of State Hull is on vacation somewhere in California, and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau is traveling in Europe in a private capacity. All of this proves that the European situation is unlikely to change drastically. The Democratic New York Times reported, "It is commendable that the democratic countries can deal with the aggressor countries with a firm and calm attitude. This calm and courageous attitude of the countries that maintain peace is the most powerful factor in upholding justice. These countries have already won a victory in the 'war of nerves'," (Havas, 19th).

### Southern Premier Encourages National Unity

Southern Capital: Yugoslav Premier Cvetković spoke today at the Zebrnjak battlefield during the 15th anniversary of the Serbian military victory, urging all Yugoslav people to unite to ensure that the country has the ability to resist foreign aggression. The Prime Minister, after recalling the battle in Zebrnjak where a small number of Serbian troops defeated an enemy force with better equipment and a larger number, encouraged the people to always strive and not be unworthy of the heroes of Zebrnjak (Reuters, 20th).

### US Express Train Derails Again

Chatsworth, New Jersey: The "Blue Comet" special express train traveling between New York City and Atlantic City derailed suddenly near here this afternoon, with approximately one hundred people killed or injured (Havas, 19th).

### US Opinion Poll: 75% Support Aiding Democratic Countries

New York: According to an opinion poll, if Britain and France go to war with Germany and Italy, the United States may not be able to stay out of it. 76% of Americans hold this view. As for how the United States should help European democratic countries, opinions vary. 25% support sending troops to Europe to participate in the war, and 40% support the United States only supplying arms to democratic countries (Havas, 19th).

### The Abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty Endangers Japan's Entire Foreign Trade Structure

The current issue of Millard's Review publishes an article by John Ahlers, discussing the impact of the United States' abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty on Japan. The translation is as follows:

The great shock suffered by the Japanese due to the US government's notification of the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty seems to have subsided slightly on the surface. The Japanese authorities seem to have ordered the newspapers to feign a rather optimistic view of the overall situation and to encourage the Japanese people to believe that the US's actions will not have an excessively serious impact on Japan and its adventurous warfare in China. Although the Japanese people have been appeased and have a false sense of security, the vast Japanese business community is still filled with fear.

As soon as the news of the abolition was announced, raw silk prices in Yokohama and Kobe plummeted, and trading in futures silk was particularly difficult. Raw silk accounts for one-third of all Japanese exports to the United States, and almost eighty percent of Japanese raw silk exports go to the United States. Japanese porcelain manufacturers are also greatly disturbed because the United States is also their most important export market. The Osaka cotton industry anticipates danger for its cotton textile exports to the United States and the Philippines. Other Japanese business circles have also expressed great concern about this matter. Cotton can be purchased from British India and Brazil, and unrefined kerosene can be supplied from the Dutch East Indies and Mexico, but many of the machines used in Japanese industry rely entirely on special machine oil from the United States to operate smoothly. This can only be purchased from the United States. Much of the expansion of Japan's war industries also relies on the continuous supply of metal machinery from the United States. Certain high-speed steel that Japan urgently needs can only be manufactured by the United States, and the scrap iron and steel needed by Japan also has the United States as the most important source.

The treaty is still in effect until January 26, 1940, more than five months from now, but it is difficult for Japan to make huge forward extra transactions in advance to avoid the various impacts after the treaty expires. The supply of raw silk is currently severely restricted. The amount of raw silk stored in Japan is not enough for even one month's exports to the United States, so it is impossible to store large amounts of raw silk in New York. In other respects, the shortage of foreign exchange prevents Japan from purchasing and storing large quantities of extra US machine oil, metal machinery, and scrap iron. Even if Japan attempts to make small-scale purchases and storage, it is feared that it will be difficult to succeed due to the US Department of Commerce's determination to oppose it.

The importance of Japan's commercial relationship with the United States can be seen at a glance from Japanese trade statistics. In the first five months of this year, of the goods exported by Japan worth 115.8 million yen, those transported to the United States accounted for 16.6 million yen. However, almost half of Japan's total exports go to countries in the Yen Bloc and cannot generate foreign exchange. Exports to other countries are only worth 59.7 million yen, with the United States accounting for 27.7% of this number. If we include Japan's exports to the Philippines and Hawaii, the percentage of the United States in Japan's exports increases to 30%. Even more noteworthy is the position of the United States in Japan's import trade. In the first five months of this year, Japan imported goods worth 121.36 million yen, of which 28.76 million yen came from other countries in the Yen Bloc. Imports from countries outside the Yen Bloc amounted to 92.6 million yen, of which 42.52 million yen came from the United States, accounting for 46% of Japan's imports from non-Yen Bloc countries. Including the Philippines and Hawaii, the figure reaches 48%. Two-thirds of all military supplies imported by Japan come from the United States, and for some of them, Japan can only import them with the goodwill of the United States.

After the current US-Japan Commercial Treaty expires, what changes will there be in this trade? It is difficult for Japan to induce the US government to conclude another treaty with it in a timely manner. Recently, the Japanese side investigated the seriousness of this possibility, and the results are quite disheartening to the Japanese. Therefore, Tokyo may not even make a proposal to negotiate another treaty. Therefore, from January 26 next year, there may be a situation of no treaty between the US and Japan, and both countries have complete freedom to treat each other's trade at will. Japanese goods in the United States will lose the benefit of the most-favored-nation clause in the current treaty and will have to pay the highest import duties. The United States, in view of the Japanese government's current subsidies for the production of export goods (such as silk) or the export goods themselves (such as porcelain), may cause Japan to pay special punitive taxes in addition to the highest import duties. Japan's suicide competition with the United States' high-value labor using low-value labor is another motive for punishing Japanese goods entering the United States. According to reliable estimates, the wages lost by American workers are ten times the value of Japanese goods imported into the United States because such goods, if not imported, must be manufactured in the United States.

Raw silk, which accounts for the majority of Japan's exports to the United States, is indeed in grave danger. Today, the United States still relies heavily on Japanese raw silk to manufacture silk stockings, but when the treaty expires, two new factories of DuPont Nemours, which can be completed early next year, will begin large-scale manufacturing of new American hosiery silk substitutes, called "Nylon". Japan's hope of maintaining itself against Nylon has been greatly reduced due to the abolition of the treaty. Japan can certainly retaliate to some extent and prohibit the import of all US goods that are not absolutely necessary, but the number of these goods is small and they account for a small portion of US exports to Japan because Japan's current trade and foreign exchange control systems have already reduced these US exports to a minimum. If Japan imposes punitive taxes on US cotton, kerosene, machinery, and scrap iron, Japan itself will have to pay these additional taxes.

What the Japanese fear most about the abolition of the treaty is that the United States may no longer be prepared to sell raw materials, kerosene, metal machinery, airplanes, and various other military supplies to them. The US government has clearly made up its mind about this action and can stop the export of certain items to Japan, not only by revising the US Neutrality Act or passing Senator Pittman's proposal to embargo arms to countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty. President Roosevelt and his government have various other ways to achieve this goal. This policy may not even require formal approval from Congress. The recent ban on the export of US airplanes to Japan, due to the strong insistence of the US State Department, shows what kind of actions it can take.

If we ask why Washington has not yet taken these measures, then it must be understood that the US-Japan Commercial Treaty is an almost insurmountable obstacle to these procedures. Article 5 of the treaty clearly stipulates that any commodity of either contracting party cannot be prohibited from being exported to the other contracting party unless its export to other countries is prohibited. This obstacle will be eliminated when the treaty expires. After that, Japan's position will no longer be able to protest the US's export ban with the force of mutual obligation.

Japan is a country that relies entirely on overseas commerce. The abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty has caused Japan to encounter the most difficult foreign trade problems it has experienced in modern times. The commerce of Japan with countries that generate foreign exchange is endangered by no less than one-third, and Japan's most important source of foreign military supplies may be cut off due to the abolition of the treaty. Furthermore, Japan also faces the danger of not obtaining understanding with Britain, and the British government may follow Washington's lead. Britain also accounts for a quarter of Japan's trade with foreign countries outside the Yen Bloc, so almost sixty percent of Japan's trade is transacted with the two Anglo-Saxon countries. The positions of Germany and Italy are not able to replace the Anglo-Saxon countries to a noteworthy degree in Japanese commerce. Manchuria and the areas occupied by the Japanese army in mainland China will not be directly affected by the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty. We will wait and see in the future. The United States does not have a commercial treaty with "Manchukuo." The United States has not recognized the Changchun puppet regime, but there is a commercial treaty between China and the United States, and in the Japanese-controlled areas, this treaty has suffered large-scale interference from the Japanese side for a long time. It is possible that the United States will no longer tolerate this interference. For example, the products of North China are now subject to foreign exchange control by the semi-official Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank. The US authorities can easily refuse to issue export certificates for North China products. If the Japanese are cut off and cannot freely obtain certain weapons and other supplies from the United States, they will of course seek to obtain them through various indirect routes. They will try to import these American goods into China, within their new sphere of influence, allowing them to indirectly purchase through Shanghai what they can no longer purchase directly from the United States. The US authorities in this port will have to carefully monitor the market in this port to prevent this kind of abuse of the strong trading position of the United States in Shanghai. Although Shanghai has been a great help to the Japanese for many years, this city should not become an active base for plotting to undermine the intentions of US trade policy.

### The Seriousness of Infectious Diseases in Fujian Province: Malaria Spreads Throughout the Province, Plague Becomes Increasingly Rampant

Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the War of Resistance, the people of Fujian Province, especially those along the coast, have moved inland together. Consequently, their lifestyles have suddenly changed, inevitably affecting their physical health. Various diseases have taken the opportunity to occur, among which malaria, meningitis, and plague are the most prevalent. According to statistics from the Provincial Health Department, the areas where malaria is prevalent cover all counties in the province, with no fewer than four million sufferers, reaching one-third of the total population. If each person needs fifty quinine pills to be completely cured, a total of two hundred million quinine pills are needed. The amount of quinine pills currently stored by public and private sectors is no longer plentiful. If sufferers want to seek treatment, they may be unable to find medicine. As for the plague in more than twenty counties along the southeastern coast and inland western Fujian, due to the lack of medical institutions and medicines, the epidemic is becoming increasingly rampant. In Yongchun, Hui'an, Longyan, Liancheng, Putian, Xianyou, and other counties, there are countless deaths, and coffins in urban and rural areas are sold out. Some people even simply bury the dead due to the inability to purchase coffins. Furthermore, meningitis, which has spread to thirty counties from last autumn to this spring, accounts for half of the province. The extent of the epidemic area is unprecedented in the history of infectious diseases. The Provincial Health Department has set up isolation wards and quarantine stations in key locations to accommodate patients and ordered the health bureaus of various counties to make every effort to prevent the spread. By mid-May, the epidemic had gradually been suppressed. In addition, there is also a disease called hydrocele, which has been found in more than ten counties along the eastern coast of Fujian. As many as forty-two percent of the young and middle-aged people suffer from this disease, which is quite alarming. After inspection by the Provincial Health Department, it was found that it is caused by mosquitoes. The mosquitoes carry a kind of filarial worm. When mosquitoes suck human blood, they transmit the worms into the human body. After maturation, they block the lymphatic system, resulting in this disease. In summary, these four diseases are indeed serious and pressing problems for the health of the people of Fujian Province. However, due to the lack of medicine, they cannot be prevented and treated. Moreover, such a large-scale disease is beyond the capacity of the limited manpower and financial resources of the local government. Therefore, the authorities of Fujian Province hope that domestic and foreign health and charitable organizations, as well as overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, will raise donations or donate large quantities of medicine for widespread treatment.

The Japanese troops stationed in Wuxi learned of this and dispatched more than two hundred Japanese soldiers.

### Shanghai Subsidiary Coin Problem Solved; Subsidiary Coin Notes to Be Issued Tomorrow; Chamber of Commerce Suggests Disposal Method for Stamps; Post Office Is Seriously Considering; Promissory Notes Issued by Various Companies Should Be Recalled Immediately

The Central Bank, under the order of the Ministry of Finance, will issue 1-fen and 5-fen subsidiary coin notes.

Regarding the stamps currently circulating in the market, which will become a problem, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has proposed a disposal method and suggested it to the Post Office. It is heard that the Post Office is seriously considering it. The details are as follows. The Ministry of Finance previously agreed to the request of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to issue 1-fen and 5-fen subsidiary coin notes by the Central Bank in order to alleviate the shortage of copper coins in Shanghai. The bank signed a contract with Yongning Printing Company in Hong Kong. The first batch of 500,000 yuan, including 300,000 yuan for 1-fen notes and 200,000 yuan for 5-fen notes, has been printed in accordance with the contract and will be issued by the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank. The issuance method is the same as that of subsidiary coin notes. One hundred 1-fen notes or twenty 5-fen notes can be exchanged for one yuan of legal tender at the bank. The reserve is 100% legal tender.

Post Office Considers Disposing of Stamps

The Shanghai Post Office has received a formal letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce suggesting a disposal method: (1) All stamps that are slightly soiled due to repeated circulation should be used by the Post Office as much as possible without penalty. (2) The stamps accumulated by major companies, banks, and stores should be retained for their own mailing purposes and not be recalled. (3) The Post Office should repurchase the stamps in the hands of peddlers and rickshaw pullers at the original price to avoid losses and set a deadline for repurchase. It is heard that the Post Office is seriously considering it.

Promissory Notes Already Issued Should Be Recalled

### False Police Shoot and Injure West Control Search Case; Municipal Council Lodges Protest; Content of Protest Letter Divided into Three Main Points; Will Be Sent to the Japanese Side by the Bureau Today

On the 10th of this month, an "Avenue Police" and plainclothes detectives holding weapons broke into the concession near Xinkangli, Jessfield Road, Shanghai West. Kimluck (KINLOOK), a West Detective on duty patrolling in the area on the police patrol car, thought that these people did not understand the boundaries, so he went forward to explain and persuade them to withdraw. Unexpectedly, these people made things difficult and opened fire to resist arrest while the West Detective turned around to call the police, and shot at Kim, the bullet entering from the back, forming the most serious stalemate. It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council is very angry at Kim's unwarranted shooting by the "Avenue Police" and drafted a strong protest on the night of the incident. It is heard that the content of the protest lists three main points, such as the "Avenue Police" entering the Public Concession to perform their duties. The protest has been approved by senior officials and will be submitted to the Japanese side today.

Protest to Be Filed Today

The Continental News reported that the Municipal Council began drafting a strong protest to be submitted to the Japanese authorities last night (19th) regarding the shooting incident of trainee West Detective Yu Luke. It is heard that the protest will be based on three factors, namely, opposing the illegal activities of the "Avenue" police on the roads of the concession, the "Avenue" police obstructing the duties of a police officer of the Police Department, and Kim Luke being shot. It is heard that the protest has been approved by two bureau officials and will be submitted to the Japanese authorities today (20th). Also, the English-language Great American Evening Post said that the Municipal Council will protest to the Japanese authorities tomorrow (21st) against the "Avenue" police patrol team shooting and injuring Kim Luke, a trainee West Detective of the Public Concession Police Department, at 5:30 p.m. yesterday (19th) on Jessfield Road between Connaught Road and Carter Road. According to reports, although Kim was shot in the back, he ran into the No. 9 armored car and opened a hand-held machine gun. Subsequently, the two sides exchanged fire, killing two "Avenue" police officers and seriously injuring two others. The other three were slightly injured. Kim is currently in the hospital and is not in danger.

Defense Forces Discuss Security in the Western District

The China Press reported that the commanders of the foreign defense forces in Shanghai held a meeting yesterday afternoon (19th) to discuss the illegal incidents that occurred in the Western District. If serious shootings occur again in this troublesome area, the result may be the declaration of martial law.

Yesterday's Security Was Extremely Tight

Yesterday, the area along Jessfield Road, Brennan Road, Roberts Road, Yanping Road, Connaught Road, Jiaozhou Road, Singapore Road, Xinzha Road, Avenue Edward VII, YuYuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, etc., in Shanghai West was densely guarded by Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives and Italian garrison troops. Patrol teams shuttled back and forth. All suspicious pedestrians and vehicles were subject to inspection. Public buses on Route 1, Route 10, Route 7, Route 9, etc., which crossed into the concession to the east, were particularly strictly inspected. Red alert vehicles were also dispatched throughout the day, galloping on the roads, and the security was extremely tight. It was even worse at night. Military police and detectives were stationed on all roads.

### Negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese Side Regarding Free Rice Transportation to Shanghai; Business Firms Issue Letters to Prevent Hoarding; Strict Restrictions on the Resumption of Rice Market Operations

Due to rampant under-the-table dealings and chaotic transactions, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Market decided to suspend operations from the 18th. It is now permitted to reopen today. However, to rectify market operations, all market activities after resumption must register the owners of goods and the consignees, to ensure that transportation and sales are compliant and easy to report. Since the Shanghai rice supply problem became severe, the Shanghai Municipal Council is currently negotiating with the Japanese authorities regarding the free transportation of rice to Shanghai. They are also advising rice merchants to sell their stored rice at fair prices. The following is a record of yesterday's situation:

Letter Requesting Publication of Rice Inventory Survey

A letter from the Bean and Rice Trade Association to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council states, "Regarding the 'Rice Inventory Survey,' it began with the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee. After the committee disbanded, our association continued to handle it. All survey forms from each period have been sent to your bureau for review and record. Recently, there have been rumors from outside claiming that the inventory numbers self-reported by the rice industry may not be reliable, which is used as propaganda to mislead people. According to the scope of this survey, it is based on reports from each warehouse and limited to warehouses within the concessions. It does not include stores outside the concessions, rice stored in rice shops, or rice purchased by households. The purpose of the survey is to understand the abundance or scarcity of food for the people to assist the authorities in planning and regulating measures. This is what your bureau understands. As for the accuracy of the survey conducted by our association, we heard that your bureau also sent personnel to investigate. We now request that the results of the investigation be published to show whether the numbers match, to clarify the reality. Our association will continue to work on this matter in the future, but we will no longer publish it publicly, except for sending it to your bureau for review or direct publication by your bureau, to avoid suspicion. We hereby declare this. We hope you will consider it."

Letter to Taxpayers' Association to Prevent Hoarding

Children's Bookstore, Yu Sheng Xiang Weaving Factory, Yonghua Printing Bureau, Lianghua Printing Bureau, and others sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday, stating, "The rice price in this city is soaring endlessly, mainly due to the control in the producing areas and the manipulation by capitalists. As a model for the citizens, your association should address the public safety of all citizens with the rise and fall of rice prices. It is requested that you, representing all citizens, send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, requesting that it jointly establish a city-wide rice inventory registration office with the French Municipal Council. Rice merchants and other hoarding households should be ordered to register the actual amount of rice in storage within three days. The registered rice will be numbered by the registration office, with the last registrant being No. 1, and ordered to submit it to a temporarily designated public sales place at a limited price until it is sold out. At the same time, representatives from each neighborhood should be allowed to form a rice inventory reporting committee to search each household and nearby shops on the day after the registration period expires, to prevent anyone from escaping. If it is found that the amount of rice stored without registration is more than ten shi, or if the amount actually registered exceeds ten shi, it will be regarded as concealment. All such rice should be confiscated, with half of it used as a reward and half of it sold at a reduced price. The proceeds should be used to subsidize the needs of refugees. By doing so, we can achieve two goals. We hereby send this letter, hoping that your association will investigate and implement it. We are extremely grateful. Furthermore, please also request the Shanghai Municipal Council to find ways to dredge the source of rice supply. This is a combined request."

Kui Yanfang's Views on Price Stabilization

Kui Yanfang, Chairman of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, expressed his opinions on handling price stabilization in Shanghai to visitors yesterday, saying, "At a time when foreign exchange is shrinking sharply, residents within the concessions are already suffering greatly, and the soaring rice price is of great concern to the people's livelihood. I advocate that price stabilization is an urgent matter. However, according to reports, only 8,000 bags are being handled for price stabilization, which seems too small. The rice market has been in panic for a long time, and the people's needs are urgent. If there is a sudden relief, everyone will rush for it. If the distribution is not proper, it will inevitably affect public order. Those in charge should have a detailed plan to prevent accidents. If economic factors make it difficult to popularize, then there are many public-spirited people in the Chinese and foreign banking circles who can unite and plan together. The number of bags for price stabilization must be no less than 200,000 to 300,000 to be effective. As for the old plan proposed by Old Qia to use the tax-free surplus of more than 300,000 yuan from the tax-free foreign rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council last year for deficit compensation, I strongly agree with it. The Shanghai Municipal Council has a special responsibility to maintain local order and should not be stingy and refuse to grant it."

Rice Riot on Changping Road

Due to speculation and hoarding, the city's food supply has been soaring, making life unbearable for the people. At around 8 p.m. last night, about 500 men and women, poorly clothed and haggard, suddenly appeared in front of Ni Yixing Rice Store at No. 81 Changping Road in western Shanghai, each holding a small amount of legal tender, hoping to buy a small amount of rice to maintain their lives. At that time, the store replied that there was no rice. This aroused public indignation, believing that it was intentional difficulty. With many people talking at once, a rice riot broke out. However, the store was indeed out of rice, so only about 100 bags of flour were looted. By the time the detectives arrived, they had dispersed and arrested three men and one woman for investigation.

### Postal Workers Request Pay Raise; Bureau Approves Allowance

Since the black market exchange rate plummeted and everything soared, the cost of living has been unprecedentedly high. Due to the difficult living conditions, the postal staff of the Shanghai Postal Administration jointly submitted a request to the postal workers' union, requesting the director Mr. Cha Peilin to approve a pay raise of several percent. After repeated consideration by Mr. Cha, it was agreed that starting from the eighth month, each postal worker from Grade B to messenger would receive a uniform allowance of 7.5 yuan per month. However, the more than 30 guards used by the bureau continued to request the same treatment to maintain their livelihood.

### Rickshaw Guild Proposes Increasing Fare by Two Cents Per Rickshaw Per Day

Approval is still required from the Public Concession. Since the foreign exchange rate plummeted, the prices of goods made from foreign and foreign raw materials have all soared. The price of rubber and hardware materials used for rickshaws has also more than doubled. The Rickshaw Guild specially convened a meeting to discuss ways to increase rickshaw fares. The result was that the pre-war "small meeting" (i.e., those operating in the Nanshi and French Concession areas) fare was 55 cents per day. Later, due to the closure of Nanshi, it was changed to 40 cents. However, the cost of rickshaw materials at that time was only four or five tenths of the current cost. Now the cost of living is getting higher and higher, and the burden on rickshaw pullers and owners is also increasing. Therefore, it was decided to adjust the fare and uniformly charge 42 cents per day from the 20th to take into account the interests of both labor and management. Regarding the rickshaws in the Public Concession, because the Shanghai Municipal Council restricts rent increases, the Special Zone Rickshaw Guild is required to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council for reconsideration to allow for a discretionary increase in rickshaw fares to maintain operations.

### Tianjin Four Chinese Cases; Powers of Attorney, etc., Sent to Shanghai

Reuters Tianjin, 20th - American lawyer Fusi Sang here has prepared various documents related to the four Chinese suspects in the assassination of Cheng case for the Shanghai Ellis Law Firm and will mail them to Shanghai soon. Among them are powers of attorney and affidavits from the four Chinese, and copies of the arrest warrants for the four Chinese. After the Ellis Law Firm obtains these documents, it can represent these four Chinese to apply for a writ of habeas corpus.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Will Hold a Meeting Today to Discuss the Issue of Jewish Refugees; Consuls from France and Japan Will Attend; The Location is the Shanghai Municipal Council Building

Regarding the issue of Jewish refugees flocking to the Shanghai Concession, the Municipal Council has always been at a loss due to lack of funds and land. In addition to French Consul Baudicci, Shanghai Municipal Council Director-General Felippe, and Japanese Consul General Miura holding consultations for days, it has also been decided to organize a board of directors, which will be responsible for organizing by French Deputy Consul General Gaitant, Jewish Refugee Society Jin Jun, Japanese Consul Itsu Garlo (transliteration), and Shanghai Municipal Council representative Naishe. It is learned that the board of directors will hold its first meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Council Building this afternoon to comprehensively discuss and resolve difficult issues.

### The Japanese Army Implements Brutal and Cruel Governance; The People in the Inland Areas Are Suffering; They Exhaust Their Ability to Extract Economically; They Arbitrarily Intimidate and Slaughter Farmers; Young People Are Forced to Undergo Military Training

The China Press reported that Chinese merchants from inland towns now residing in Shanghai have investigated the situation in their hometowns and obtained news about the Japanese army consolidating its position in inland towns. These merchants are now living off their meager savings in Shanghai, so they are eager to return to the inland areas to do business again. They first studied the possibility of selling rice and found that they could buy 100 jin of rice from farmers for 5 to 7 yuan and sell it in Shanghai for 20 yuan. After deducting transportation costs, they could still make a profit of two or three times. They also sold cloth and other goods to the inland areas and made twice the profit. However, according to a merchant, he sold several shipments between a small town in the inland area and Shanghai and made a considerable profit.

Japanese Army Manipulates Rice Grain Trade

One day, he was suddenly arrested by a puppet police officer, thrown into prison, and suffered greatly. His property was confiscated, and he had to abandon his business and flee to a large city that was not noticed. Given this precedent, other small merchants engaged in similar businesses decided to stop selling. The rice grain trade was then exclusively manipulated by a group controlled by the Japanese army. Therefore, the Japanese army gained a lot because they arbitrarily demanded rice grain transported to Shanghai and other consumption centers before allowing passage.

Chinese Guerillas Secretly Restrict

This ingenious method of extraction was known to the Chinese guerrillas in the rural areas of the rice-producing areas, and they ordered that no rice should be sold to the people sent by the Japanese army. On some roads, guerrillas did not allow each person to transport more than 40 jin of rice per shipment, which was only enough to purchase the needs of their own family. This method greatly reduced the amount of rice and other products falling into the hands of the Japanese. It appears that the number of guerrillas around the Beijing-Shanghai area and other areas along the railway line is rapidly increasing, and the economic program of the Japanese army in the occupied areas is now in danger.

Chinese And Japanese Troops Mutual Purging

Also, according to a gentleman who talked about the situation in a certain city in his hometown, the Japanese army has established a puppet government in the city and is using the city as a base. Now it has begun a "purging" movement against the guerrillas in the area. Guerrillas in other areas have also begun a movement to purge the Japanese garrison and are forcing the Japanese garrison to retreat into larger cities along the railway line. Therefore, the current result seems to be definitely in favor of the guerrillas. This is largely due to the large number of guerrillas.

Indiscriminate Arrests and Torture of Villagers

However, the guerrillas cannot prevent the Japanese army from repeatedly dispatching one to three hundred soldiers with machine guns and small mountain cannons, as well as three days' worth of food, to attack the towns where the guerrillas are based. When the Japanese army arrives, the guerrillas are already at a slightly farther place, looking for favorable opportunities to launch a night attack, or to annihilate sentries and small teams of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army then arrests several civilians and escorts them back to the headquarters, where they are severely tortured, forcing them to reveal information about the guerrillas active in the vicinity.

A Terrifying World In Human Hell

Both the guerrillas and the Japanese soldiers often wear plain clothes, especially when engaged in reconnaissance. Villagers often do not know who the other party is when someone points a gun at them, leading to mistaken words, and being killed or suffering. This is the chaos and terror that the Japanese army has brought into the entire occupied area. The Japanese widely posted posters in the occupied areas, calling this the "New Order in East Asia" and "East Asian Peace." The hard-working Chinese farmers live this life, no less than a human hell. They suffer and dare not tell the outside world.

Young People Join Guerillas

Recently, the Japanese army has repeatedly forcibly conscripted Chinese people in the occupied areas and subjected them to large-scale training. In a certain area, the Japanese army forced men aged 18 to 25 to undergo military training. These young people, unwilling to fight against their compatriots, flocked to the guerrilla areas, and many enthusiastically registered to join the guerrillas. A certain unit suddenly increased by as many as 3,000 volunteers.

Changing Tactics Want To Fight The Soviet Union

In order to appease the fears of young people and faced with strong opposition from the puppets, the Japanese army changed its tactics and announced that young people do not have to fight against their compatriots, but will be sent to the three northeastern provinces to fight the Soviets. Because the young people have almost all fled, the Japanese army plans to forcibly conscript older men aged 25 to 30 who have not fled. The Japanese army is not yet ready to set its trap to lure these men into its net, but it has already leaked the news, so these men are also fleeing.

Middle-Aged Men Forced To Train

However, tens of thousands of those who could not escape are now being trained in Nanjing and other places. The policy adopted by the Japanese army is to keep young people as far away from their hometowns as possible, making it difficult to escape. If they try to escape, it will not be difficult to find out because of the different dialects. Because the border of the three northeastern provinces is threatened by the Soviet Union, the Japanese army is now carrying out a large-scale plan to train Chinese people to fight the Soviets. The Japanese army originally planned to train these young people when it had pacified the whole of China.

People In Eastern Two Provinces Forced To Come To Shanghai

However, because the Soviet Union did not intend to sit idly by, the Japanese army accelerated the conscription of young people in the inland areas of central China, and its implementation of the anti-communist movement was to conquer China and then use China to conquer the Soviet Union and other places. Many people from Lu Province who migrated to the three northeastern provinces have been forced by the Japanese army to come to the inland areas of Shanghai to fight against the guerrillas. How can the Japanese army make these young people quickly form an army by forcing them to train in central China, and use them to occupy vast areas and drive the white people out of Asia?

### Yellow Sand Is Under Unified Control; Construction Is Halted; Thousands Of Workers Are In Urgent Need Of Relief

The various yellow sands needed for construction in Shanghai were purchased from Sizhou by members of the Shanghai Sand and Stone Industry Association, and then transported to Shanghai for sale by various gang transport merchants. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai environment was special, and the local products in the four suburbs were all under unified control. The Association has petitioned the concession authorities to find ways to dredge the source, but so far, the source is still scarce. As a result, the entire construction industry in Shanghai has been affected and has been declared halted and cannot be carried out. All sand and stone firms have also temporarily suspended business. However, it is hoped that the concession authorities will urgently find ways to maintain normal business so that it can continue. According to the person in charge of the industry yesterday, the capital of the members of the industry is very thin and the scale is small. Moreover, the profit from operating sand and stone is very low. Now that business is suspended, thousands of workers are suffering from unemployment, and the cost of living is high. If this continues, there will be no place to stand. The situation is urgent and cannot be delayed. It is deeply hoped that the authorities will do their best to provide relief.

### The Consuls Of The Consular Corps Bid Farewell To The Chilean Consul General

The China Press reported that Chilean Consul General to Shanghai, Vega, has been appointed as the Counselor of the Chilean Legation in Tokyo. The consuls of the Shanghai Consular Corps hosted a banquet for Vega at the French Club on the 17th of this month and presented him with a silver cigarette case signed by all the consuls. Vega will go to Japan in mid-September after his successor, Mr. Narin, arrives in Shanghai to take office. Before his departure, there will be many private banquets to bid farewell to Vega. It is reported that Vega came to Shanghai to take office on October 7, 1935. Health Forum

### The Influence And Value Of Physical Beauty On Love Between Men And Women

--- Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Regarding everything about physical beauty, of course, facial beauty is necessary, but the overall must also be taken into account. Now we want to promote "healthy beauty." That kind of "romantic" and "poetic" "pale-faced scholar" has lost its sense of the times, so the conditions for physical beauty are: "correct posture" and "developed muscles"; in short, the physique must be "strong and solid"! An unhealthy body will not have enough spirit, and the fun of family questioning after marriage will not be strong, and it will also affect future children, so you must pay attention to the other party's habits of sports, hygiene, entertainment, etc.

At the same time, we cannot deny that the foundation of marriage is love, and the driving force of love is "beauty", so it can also be said that the first condition for choosing a spouse is "beauty." But when it comes to beauty, it is easy to think of appearance, and in general, women often use "appearance" beauty as the standard for matching spouses, which is really wrong. Beauty should focus on reproductive instinct to be infinitely happy.

Speaking of the beauty of reproductive instinct, this is also related to physical beauty, because after the body is healthy and beautiful, the body must be healthy and disease-free, so the reproductive function is full and strong. In terms of love, this kind of man is always loved by women. In terms of fertility, the children produced by this kind of man must be excellent and strong. As for himself, he must also feel infinite happiness, full of spirit, ruddy complexion, and rich intelligence, unlike the thin ones who suffer from neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, impotence and infertility, and other reproductive power disorders. Since the combination of men and women belongs to reproduction, these problems should be treated quickly.

Regarding the cultivation of reproductive beauty and healthy beauty, it is best to avoid self-indulgence during development, avoid licentiousness before marriage, and avoid indulgence after marriage. If the innate is insufficient, or those who commit this due to weak will, the German genuine lift ball essence preparation for men "Bu Ti Kang" should be taken during treatment. This has a definite therapeutic value in clinical practice and is trusted by our doctors, so we dare to introduce it to patients. It is most suitable for those with incomplete development, neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, and premature ejaculation. Its female "Bu Ti Kang" has the effect of developing breast peaks, regulating menstruation, and sowing seeds, and has unparalleled effects on physical beauty.

Modern Medicine

### Consuming Opium is Like Borrowing Money with Usurious Interest!

— (Authored by American Medical Doctor, Huang Zhongchang)

Our human energy is originally limited and should not be excessively used. If energy is used excessively, future energy cannot be as ample as before. We often see many people who, due to excessive fatigue during the day, feel that their energy is not sustained and often want to use temporary stimulant drugs to compensate. The most common is opium. People who smoke opium do not necessarily use it for stomachaches, heartaches, or any other pain, eventually becoming addicted. However, most of them are physically fatigued and want to use opium to stimulate themselves. It is also true that those who indulge in lascivious pleasures have to borrow the stimulant properties of opium to pre-consume tomorrow's energy in order to seek immediate gratification because their energy is depleted. This is no different from borrowing money from someone at usurious interest rates, which must be repaid with both principal and interest to the creditor in the future. Therefore, the more opium a person smokes, the more exhausted their energy becomes, and the more they need to smoke. The result will inevitably be physical and mental exhaustion. This is like debtors who accumulate a high debt platform and eventually go bankrupt, which is the same reasoning. Therefore, smoking opium is the same as borrowing money with usurious interest from a red-headed Indian.

"Quitting opium" is originally not an easy task, but it requires strong and effective support. The medicine "Bu Ti Kang" (Body Supplement Kang) is the greatest tonic for saving all exhausted energy.

Originally, smoking opium cannot increase any energy; it only invigorates energy temporarily. "Bu Ti Kang," on the other hand, is entirely made from the youth glands of strong animals. After taking it, it can promote the development of cells and accelerate the function of metabolism. All those whose cells have lost elasticity due to opium, are weakened, have reduced blood, are thin in muscle, have short energy, or have nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and kidney deficiency due to excessive sexual activity can experience special effects from taking "Bu Ti Kang." It can also enable opium smokers to automatically quit after taking "Bu Ti Kang" because "Bu Ti Kang" also contains a kind of egg yolk substance, which is of great benefit in terms of quitting smoking.

### The Main Points of Treating the Lungs

— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

The lung is an unconscious organ, so it is unaware when it is invaded by tubercle bacilli. Even if it is eroded into a cavity, there is no specific pain. Only when tubercle bacilli attack the pleura and cause pleurisy is there a feeling of stabbing pain in the chest, or the chest cavity accumulates water due to pleurisy, or death occurs due to tuberculous meningitis. Therefore, to treat lung disease, one should pay attention to recuperation, such as air circulation and sufficient sunlight. For diet, one should especially take nutritious and easily digestible foods and avoid stimulants such as tobacco and alcohol. The main aspect is to rely on the special medicine for lung disease, "Bu Fei Yi Na Er" (Lung Supplement One Er), to increase the calcium content of the lungs and kill tubercle bacilli. Therefore, lung disease, no matter what stage it reaches, can be completely cured from the root. Therefore, the popularity of "Bu Fei Yi Na Er" in various countries is by no means accidental.

### The Damage of Masturbation to Brainpower

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

Regarding masturbation, medical scientists have conducted countless investigations and researches, which have proven that this behavior is easy to become unrestrained, and once committed, it is generally difficult to quit.

However, which part of the body is most susceptible to the harmful effects of such behavior? Dr. Henry Havelock Ellis, a famous British sex expert, pointed out that the brain marrow is the first part to suffer, followed by sexual function, and finally the spinal nerves. Because the motivation for masturbation arises from erotic fantasies in the brain marrow, it must consume a large amount of imaginative power, and then use various methods to achieve the purpose of masturbation. Therefore, people who suffer from masturbation will first suffer from insomnia, and then memory loss, headaches, heaviness in the head, and other morbid states will appear one by one. Therefore, there are many middle school students whose academic performance declines due to excessive masturbation.

To treat this disease, one must first prohibit the bad habit of masturbation and strive to go to bed early and get up early, be pure in heart and few in desires, and then take the "Bu Ti Kang," a male preparation made of testicle essence that nourishes the brain, kidneys, and blood. It can completely cure brain injuries and loss of libido and infertility caused by masturbation. However, if there is a phenomenon of nocturnal emission, three "Nai Er Si" (Niles) nocturnal emission tablets should be taken at the same time.

Gonorrhea Chat

### The Truth and Treatment of Gonorrheal Discharge

— Narrated by Physician Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

The truth of gonorrheal discharge, the forms it takes are different. Generally, this kind of gonorrheal discharge is not paid much attention to by patients during the acute phase because the purulent fluid in the urethra during acute gonorrhea flows copiously, so there is no need to distinguish the truth of the gonorrheal discharge. However, after gonorrhea passes through the acute phase and becomes chronic, this kind of gonorrheal discharge, which is most irritating and annoying to patients, persists for a long time. In fact, wherever there are traces of gonococci in the body of gonorrhea patients, inflammation occurs, and this inflammation is often a necessary condition for the production of gonorrheal discharge. Therefore, patients with gonorrhea who have not cleared their gonorrheal discharge have not yet cured their gonorrhea. However, there are also cases where the gonococcal toxins have been cleared, but the epithelial cells have peeled off, or other pyogenic cocci are causing trouble. Therefore, it cannot be generalized. In short, this kind of symptom must be treated by an experienced physician with complete equipment in order to obtain the truth and be cured.

The shape of the gonorrheal discharge is also very inconsistent, some are shaped like dots, and some are shaped like strokes. Most of them appear in the morning and in the urine of patients with chronic gonorrhea. Generally, all symptoms of chronic gonorrhea have them, and the residual inflammation of posterior urethral gonorrhea is most common. Other conditions such as prostatitis and cystitis also have this symptom. Therefore, to eliminate this kind of gonorrheal discharge, a comprehensive treatment must be used. Therefore, among oral medications, the drug "Ke Lin Nong" (Gram-Negative Nong) has to be recommended as a giant. Physical therapy, German static electricity therapy, is the leader of various electrotherapies. In addition, surgical operations are used. Therefore, the gonorrheal discharge that is difficult to eradicate can be completely cured in three to five weeks. I have repeatedly tried it with success in my clinical practice for more than 20 years.

Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 registrations are sent out every day, each registration costs five jiao, and two copies of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases," worth one yuan, are given away.

### Increasing Rent at This Time is Tantamount to Accelerating the Collapse of the Market - A Person in Charge of a Certain Public Organization Expresses the Need to Stop It - Thousands of Tenants of Jianye Company Firmly Oppose It

The soaring prices in Shanghai have affected the vast majority of citizens, making it difficult to maintain even the minimum standard of living. However, at this time, some property owners still want to propose rent increases to tenants and continue to implement oppression. Recently, rent disputes have occurred successively in places such as East and West Siwen Lane on Xinzha Road and Zunde Lane on Xiamen Road. According to a person in charge of a certain public organization, the post-war Shanghai market has formed a superficial prosperity due to the surge in population, but consumption exceeds production. We have long expected that it would be difficult to maintain for a long time. In recent years, unprecedentedly high prices have made it difficult for refugees to live for a long time. Western newspapers have even speculated that if this situation continues to worsen, in six months, Shanghai will have empty houses but no one to rent, as was the case before the war. At this time, property owners are still increasing rents, which is tantamount to adding insult to injury and accelerating the collapse of the entire market. The authorities should come forward to stop this abnormal situation in order to maintain public life and the entire market. It is also reported that the China Jianye Real Estate Company, on the pretext of foreign exchange contraction, recently notified the tenants of various lanes under its jurisdiction, such as Wanyi Fang on Luban Road, Paris New Village, Bugao Lane on Albert Road, Huayuan Fang on Father Jin Road, Renji Lane on Ximen Road, Jianye Lane on Fuli Road, Xilin Lane on Jiasiyi Road, Xingshun Lane on Ganshidong Road, and houses in Bailbu Road, Pushi Road, and Dapu Bridge, to increase rents by 30% from September 1. Most tenants believe that this rent increase is the second time since the war. At this critical time, the lives of residents in the isolated island are generally difficult. If rents continue to be increased again and again, they will be stretched to the limit and unable to bear the burden. Therefore, all tenants unanimously resolutely refuse and jointly send a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession requesting assistance in mediation. However, it is learned that the company does not sympathize with the requests of thousands of tenants and will still implement the rent increase. Therefore, all tenants are extremely angry and determined to unite and carry out reasonable resistance. In addition to sending representatives to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association to request assistance in mediation, they have also hired Chinese and French lawyers as legal advisors and will appeal to the court for handling if necessary.

### The Property of the "Manure King" Will Be Sealed Up - Heirs Involved in Litigation Due to Debts - Each Holds a Different View, the Court Orders Another Trial

After the death of Ma Fuqi, the "Manure King," his estate was worth 100,000 yuan. Initially, it was managed by his wife (nicknamed Sister Agui), who established the Ma Gui Ji accounting firm. After Ma's wife died, it was jointly managed by his sons Ma Hongkui, Hongsheng, and Honggen. Not long after, Ma Hongkui also died of illness.

Regarding the issue of estate management

Hongkui's wife, Ma Chen, along with her children Ma Lusen, Luzhen, and Luying, litigated with Ma Hongsheng and Honggen in the Second Special Court. After nearly two years, it was resolved through mediation by relatives and friends. In addition to the equal division of all the estate among the three families, the 21 houses and land in Kangji Lane on Malang Road and the 8 houses and land in Shunyang Lane on Caishi Road were also assigned to the three families of Ma Hongkui, Hongsheng, and Honggen.

Common Property

As the ancestral property of Ma Zhu Ji, no family may dispose of it individually. Recently, Ma Luying, the daughter of Ma Hongkui, stated that her mother Chen and her siblings Ma Lusen and Luzhen were involved in a loan dispute with a Mrs. Zhou, and Zhou petitioned the court to seal up the above-mentioned two properties. Ma Luying expressed her dissent and hired lawyer Xu Yinrong to submit a statement to the Civil Division of the Second Special Court

Opposing the Sealing Up

Stating that the properties on Kangji Lane, Malang Road, and Shunyang Lane, Caishi Road, are the common property of the plaintiff's late father, Ma Hongkui, and uncles, Ma Hongsheng and Ma Honggen. The plaintiff's late father should have received one-third of the total, and the plaintiff, her mother Chen, and her siblings Lusen and Luzhen each received one-quarter of this one-third. Zhou, on the pretext of a loan dispute with the plaintiff's mother and siblings, etc.

Loan Disputes

Sealed up the above-mentioned two properties, which damaged the plaintiff's interests. Because the plaintiff never borrowed money from Zhou, she could not but declare her objection to the sealing up of all the property. The court accepted the statement. The case was briefly heard by Judge Wu in the Civil Seventh Division the day before yesterday and then ordered a postponement for another trial.

### A Den of Opium Smokers Was Cracked Down

According to the Ningbo Newspaper, the French Concession Mailan Police Station received information that someone had established an opium-selling agency at No. 11 Baoyu Lane, Ningyu Street, a three-story building. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 19th (the day before yesterday), they secretly dispatched Chinese and French detectives to arrest them. Unfortunately, these people were well-informed and had already fled. Only a den of opium smokers was found on the third floor, and five men and one woman who were addicted to smoking opium were arrested, along with their smoking paraphernalia. They were all taken to the police station and detained for further investigation.

### On the Day Before Yesterday, a Japanese Warship Caused Trouble in the High Tide of the Huangpu River - A Jardine Matheson Lighter Was Hit While Turning Around in the High Tide - The Stern of the Ship Turned and Sank Two Sampans

According to the North China Daily News, the turbulent currents of the Huangpu River caused another accident yesterday (the 19th). The No. 17 Giru (transliteration) Maru of the Japanese Navy destroyer sank two small river boats in order to avoid a lighter belonging to Jardine Matheson. Then it drove straight towards a tugboat and a lighter of the Muller Company, causing the tugboat and lighter to turn around and hit a wood-carrying boat. Previously, the warship was at

10:05 AM

Turning around in the high tide, preparing to berth at buoys No. 2 and No. 3. When the ship turned sideways in the river, the Jardine Matheson No. 8 tugboat towed a No. 16 lighter downstream towards the Japanese warship. The tugboat captain was quite frightened and attempted to avoid getting caught in the Japanese warship, which was lying horizontally in the river. He then

Cut the Cables

Released the lighter, but the lighter still touched the port side of the Japanese warship, breaching the oil tank. The Japanese warship quickly turned its stern to avoid the lighter, but unexpectedly, the stern crashed into a group of sampans, sinking two of them. The Japanese warship then moved forward towards Pudong, moving the stern of the ship away from the sampans. At that time, there was a

Muller Company

A tugboat towing a lighter was going upstream, near buoys No. 2 and No. 3, when it was in great danger of being hit by the Japanese warship. It turned to avoid the Japanese warship, causing the lighter towed behind the wheel to hit a Chinese ship carrying timber, causing it to be severely damaged. The tide was running high at the time, so it was difficult to attribute blame to anyone for the collision.

Tugboat Captain

Apparently thought that by cutting the cables, the lighter would be able to float past the Japanese warship, but the river tide caused it to hit the port side of the Japanese warship directly. The Japanese warship Girumaru is now berthed at buoys No. 2 and No. 3 on the Huangpu River, with a small hole on the port side of the oil tank caused by the lighter.

### A Young Woman Died Tragically - Stabbed Forty or Fifty Times

Jiang Zhao, a young woman from Jiangbei, 24 years old, residing at a certain number in Lane 103 (i.e., Chunyang Lane) on Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, wearing white linen pants and a linen waistcoat, was stabbed all over her body with a sharp knife in her room at around 9:25 last night, totaling as many as forty or fifty stabs. Blood gushed out like a spring, and she died on the spot. The murderer took the opportunity to escape. Neighbors discovered it and reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate the scene, called an ambulance to transport the body to Renji Hospital, and then transferred it to the autopsy station, pending notification to the court for examination.

### A Child Fell and Died

Jiang Shen, a woman from Ningbo, 38 years old, residing at No. 66 Xiafei Road, her 7-year-old son, Jiang Futong, was playing on the sun deck of the four-story apartment at around 8:00 AM on the 19th when he accidentally fell from a height onto the cement ground at the back door, injuring his head. Shen discovered it and immediately sent him by rickshaw to Yongchuan Hospital, across from the Empire Theater. He died of his injuries at 6:00 PM that afternoon. It was reported to the Second Special Court today to send someone to examine the body.

### Wang Junqing's Fraud Case - Jia Bonian is Innocent

Juli Foreign Firm's Shanghai branch is located at No. 9 on the Bund. A man named Wang Junqing, in the name of a comprador of the branch, collected a deposit of 1,000 yuan from Le Xiaofu of Hubei (resident of No. 9, Lane 118, Huanlong Road) on May 26 of this year, promising to appoint Le as the director of the shipping department of the foreign firm in Hankou. Later, the head office of the foreign firm suspended the business of the Shanghai branch, and Le's position also came to nothing. Wang Junqing was charged in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for collecting deposits from various liaison officers. Le Xiaofu believed that Jia Bonian, who worked in the shipping industry, was in collusion with Wang Junqing to defraud him of the deposit. Recently, he submitted a statement to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Jia of fraud. Jia hired two lawyers, Yang Ruinian and Wu Chuliang, to defend him. The case was investigated by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, and Jia Bonian was declared innocent yesterday.

### Two People Were Beaten While Negotiating Special Goods

Yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM, two yellow people of unknown nationality wearing purple-red suits (one evening, Korean) went to a certain number in Pingkang Lane, Kangti Road, French Concession, to negotiate special goods. While passing in front of No. 318 Caishi Road, several people suddenly talked to the two people of unknown nationality. It cannot be proved that these people and the people of unknown nationality knew each other before. Later, the two sides quarreled from the negotiation, first verbally, and then physically. At that time, many people on the road stopped to watch. As a result, the two people of unknown nationality were slightly injured. When the nearby patrol guards heard the alarm and rushed over, the people involved had already dispersed into the crowd. The patrol guards took the two people of unknown nationality to the police station to investigate the incident and then sent them by car to the hospital to treat their minor injuries.

### The Former and Current Principals of Juxun Primary School on Hartung Road are Involved in Litigation - The Court Ruled to Suspend the Trial Before Confirming Their Identities

Chen Binzhang, currently residing at No. 13 Beigaoshou Lane, Averquin Road, recently submitted a statement to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Cao Chinian (i.e., Cao Ziying, 31 years old this year), a native of Jiading, the principal of Juxun Primary School, No. 32 Cihou South Lane, Hartung Road, of embezzlement and breach of trust. The gist of his accusation is that Juxun Primary School was founded solely by the plaintiff, who served as its principal. In the past two years, due to being busy with other matters, he left the affairs of the school to the defendant, Cao Chinian. Unexpectedly, Cao betrayed his trust and

Occupied the School

Therefore, he had no choice but to file a lawsuit, etc. After receiving a copy of the accusation of embezzlement and breach of trust, the defendant Cao Chinian immediately hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to write a reply, raising several points: (1) Stating that Juxun Primary School was founded by the respondent in the autumn of the 25th year of the Republic of China. At that time, in order to cope with the environment, he hired the plaintiff to serve as honorary principal. The rent of the house and all expenses were borne by the respondent.

School Administration

Was also handled by the respondent. Starting in the autumn of the following year, the board of directors elected the respondent as principal. This situation was known to the school staff and students' parents. The plaintiff recently suffered from economic depression and kicked a friend out of his house. He took advantage of a misunderstanding between the school and Hartung Foreign Firm over rent increases and repairs to the school building, falsely claiming that the school was founded by the plaintiff, which is not allowed by law. Because the plaintiff is neither the actual tenant of the school building nor the taxpayer of the house, nor does he have any documents to prove the establishment of Juxun Primary School.

Documents Available for Verification

And the Shanghai Education Overview and the Shanghai School Survey Record all indicate that the respondent is the principal of Juxun Primary School, which shows that the facts alleged by the plaintiff are fictitious. He requested that the respondent be declared innocent. The court accepted the statement. Judge Huang held a court hearing the other day, and both parties held their own opinions. The court decided that the case could not proceed until the plaintiff Chen Binzhang's identity as the principal was confirmed. Therefore, the court ruled to suspend the trial of this case.

### The Murder Case of a Tenant at No. 1 Yuanshang Lane - The "Morphine King" Was Arrested - The Main Culprit's Wife's Confession Attempted to Deny It - Ma Pi Abiao Shirked Responsibility and Denied It

At No. 1 Yuanshang Lane, East Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, the second landlord was Auntie Chai Gong, a native of Shaoxing, who lived on the mezzanine floor. The second floor was rented to He Jingqing, the owner of the Lao Zhengxing Restaurant on Fuzhou Road, who lived with his son-in-law. The third floor was rented to the car driver Zhang Xiaomao and his wife, both from Chaozhou. However, disputes often arose among the cohabitants. At around 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month, Zhang Xiaomao brought out

The "Morphine King"

Shen Abiao (nicknamed Ma Pi Abiao) residing at No. 553 Averquin Road, gathered dozens of hooligans, together with female hooligan Yang Yashi, and the escaped robber Lao San and four or five others, each holding wooden sticks and knives, and swarmed into He Jingqing's room, destroying all the debris. They also stabbed He's partner, Li Binghuan, with a knife, causing blood to flow like a torrent, and he fell to the ground. He himself was also injured internally by wooden sticks. The murderers and others, seeing that their goal had been achieved,

Scattered and Fled

After the incident, He reported the injuries to the police station, which sent detectives to Qunleju Tea House on Gongguan Road and arrested six male and female hooligans, including Shen Abiao, Su Shichang, Chen Bingsheng, Li Julin, and Yang Yashi. However, the main culprit Zhang Xiaomao had already fled after hearing the news. Only his wife, Zhang Chen, was arrested, and they were all taken to the police station and handed over to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for investigation. The victim He Jingqing and Li Binghuan, accompanied by lawyer Zhang Fukang, arrived at the case to provide information about the incident and to attach a civil lawsuit, requesting

A Judgment Ordering Compensation

For medical expenses, etc. Subsequently, the defendant Zhang Chen confessed that the incident was caused by the second landlord and her son-in-law forcing them to increase the rent. Her husband, Zhang Xiaomao, only agreed to increase it by two or three yuan per month, but He and others insisted on increasing it by ten yuan. At that time, her husband refused, so He and others often provoked trouble. Therefore, she could not bear it and asked a friend to go and take revenge, etc. When questioned about Shen Abiao, he shirked all responsibility and denied it. After verifying the confessions in court, the judge ordered a postponement for retrial on the 22nd of this month. The defendants were remanded in custody.

### The Murderer Was Released Due to Insufficient Evidence

Wang Huorong, a native of Liuhe, was assassinated in Zhao Wang Temple, Liuhe, on June 13 of this year. Recently, his adopted brother, Guo Wenhua, learned that his brother's death was caused by Zhou Huaiqing, a fellow villager. Recently, he met Zhou on Sichuan Road, Hankou Road, and reported him to the police, who arrested and escorted him to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. However, during the postponement, the evidence that Guo could produce was only Wang Huorong's wife's statement that she heard rumors that her husband was killed by Zhou. However, how could the police station use hearsay as evidence? Because Guo could not provide any further conclusive evidence, the police station's lawyer, Jiang Baolian, applied to the First Special Court to stop the detention of Zhou and release him. Judge Feng Shide approved it and ordered Zhou's release.

### Anecdotes

— Yong

The people of Xikang never eat fish. It is said that this is because, in Xikang, when a person dies, their family throws the body into the river for the fish to eat, considering it a water burial.

Eskimos consider "eating" the happiest thing in life. They have a very large appetite. A young man under the age of twenty can eat eight and a half pounds of seal meat and one and one-sixth pounds of bread in a single day.

The current President of the Control Yuan, Mr. Yu Youren, likes to wear cloth shoes and socks and has never worn gauze or silk shoes and socks in his life.

The Mongolian people like to eat raw meat, just as the people of Hunan like to eat spicy food. Furthermore, the Mongolian people do not bathe or wash their faces year-round.

When Mr. Wu Zhihui has nothing to do, he likes to go to small restaurants to eat "snacks." When Mr. Wu goes out, he often wears a small vest over his long gown.

In Africa, there is a tribe called the Mbuti. They like to eat human flesh and often go to other places in groups to "hunt humans." When they capture prisoners, they eat their flesh.

Recently, a dish in Kunming restaurants has become very popular among the locals. It is called "Elephant Trunk and Deer Tendon."

### Attention Leather Shoe Wearers

— Zhenqing

The number of people wearing leather shoes is increasing nowadays, as if not wearing a pair of leather shoes does not show one to be a Shanghai person. As a result, leather shoe stores are springing up like mushrooms after the rain. However, the cost of a pair of leather shoes is at least around ten yuan. Often, many people find that the shoe uppers are still good after a short time, but the thick soles are already broken. It should be known that each leather shoe has two plum blossom-shaped nails on the bottom. Their roots are very deep and can penetrate all the way into the sole. If one is not careful and wears them after a heavy rain, water will definitely seep in. After three times, the soles will have rotted and broken, and they will be difficult to repair. They will become useless on rainy days. Wouldn't it be a pity to discard them? If, when buying leather shoes, one pours raw alum on them to plug the holes of the two nails, then they will be more durable and long-lasting. When it rains, more shoe polish should be applied to make them shine, because leather is not easily penetrated by water!

### The Latest Square Inlay Trend in Paris

— Wu Gong

Diamonds are the most precious ornaments for modern women. They have a sparkling brilliance, especially under the dazzling lights, so bright that people are dazzled, as if the diamonds are emitting magic light. Contemporary artisans are putting a lot of fine work into diamond inlay techniques to lure the extravagant hearts of noble urban women.

In the past, inlaying took the form of single diamonds. Rings, earrings, or bracelets were based on a single large diamond, surrounded by small diamonds in a circular pattern. Since the popularity of three-dimensional and streamlined designs, diamond artisans have immediately used their brains to apply them to diamond inlay techniques. The trend began to sprout in the second half of 1938, and this year, square inlay has dominated the entire jewelry world, especially the Parisian style, which is the standard for the world and is popular all over the globe. The image above is one type of square inlay. It uses two large diamonds as the main body, with a row of small square diamonds running horizontally in the middle, and small round diamonds embellishing both sides, forming a rectangular strip. This is the most popular ring in Paris in 1939. Women's bracelets also use rectangular platinum as the base, with small square and round diamonds arranged in a streamlined pattern, and a few large diamonds set off in between, further highlighting the strong brilliance. The bracelet chains are made of three strands of pearls, luxurious and rich, fully expressing the style.

The first store in Shanghai to introduce this square inlay is the Beilaiheng Jewelry Store on Maixiai Road. The owner of this store has an older brother in Paris, who sends him new styles every month. There are many designs that have not been seen in Shanghai. At the same time, he purchases many inlaying instruments from Paris, which are said to be the most complete equipment.

### A Week's Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Speaking of dishes made with gourds, last week I introduced winter melon soup. I'm sure many of you readers have tried it. Winter melon itself doesn't have any special flavor; "light" can be used to describe it. It is most suitable for making soup, as it can be used at any time as long as there is fresh broth. Because it has been extremely hot since autumn, I still focus on the word "light" when cooking. The other day I made a winter melon and pork lung soup. It is said that pork lung is good for nourishing the lungs, so people with coughs are quite fond of it. When washing it, one must put in a lot of effort, carefully removing the blood vessels, washing it clean, and then buying some ham bones to put together with it. Cut the winter melon into squares, add some fragrant mushrooms and other ingredients, and simmer slowly in the pot until it is tender. The soup will be clear and the taste fresh, and the pork lung will be tender and delicious. There is also a pork heart, which often comes with the lung. After simmering it until tender, its taste is even better than the lung. Come on! Why don't you all give it a try?

### Mezzanine

— Xiangqi

Building a mezzanine is a desperate measure. If there are too many things and there is no place to put them, and the corners are already full, then a mezzanine is built to store miscellaneous items. There is also another type where the family has many people, and they have no choice but to build a mezzanine to avoid crowding. The most embarrassing thing is the sub-landlord who makes a living solely from mezzanines. Most sub-landlords sublet the remaining rooms for profit. Although money is coveted by everyone, it must be of a considerable amount, as the so-called "gentleman loves wealth, but obtains it in a proper way." For example, this sub-landlord has already built a mezzanine and has already made money from the mezzanine. Naturally, they should no longer, in these years, expand the area of the mezzanine as if taking advantage of a fire, or add a third layer of mezzanine, only caring about their own income, regardless of whether others are annoyed or not, or whether it is dangerous or not. It should be known that adding a new mezzanine, for the sake of making money, must mean a new family moving in. More families will inevitably increase the population, which is the same as having a highly dangerous stove. Hygiene is certainly out of the question, but the problem of fire is really terrifying. On a large scale, it can affect other people's lives, and in short, it can be said to be a problem for the entire society. Therefore, the former concession authorities strictly banned mezzanines, and everyone was wary of this. Who knew that, as time passed, everyone had faintly forgotten about it, and a group of profit-seeking sub-landlords, seeing the urgent need for housing, put their minds to work and, at any cost, used their clever deceptive means to apply for permits from the authorities, which has become increasingly common recently. If this continues to spread, public danger will inevitably continue to increase, and there will be more worries about society.

This situation is most prevalent in Yongji Lane on Wangzhi Road, near where I live. The number of houses that have been rebuilt and had mezzanines added can be counted, but there are still many who are doing it secretly. I hope that the authorities will immediately stop this to avoid disasters.

### One Person Gets Rich, Millions Starve

### The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of the World's Four Greats

— Yin Sanlang

Speaking of the world's four great figures, I think readers will all know them. They are Adolf Hitler of Germany, Prime Minister Benito Mussolini of Italy, President Chiang Kai-shek of China, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union. They are regarded as great figures by the world because they are praised for their political achievements. Although the policies and ideologies of each country are different, their clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all on the same front of not wasting, being very frugal, and being very hardworking. If we compare this with the extravagant degree of Shanghai's current wealthy people in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, how ashamed we would feel!

Clothing

Hitler has a lifelong quirk: he doesn't like to wear wool fabrics like serge. Therefore, most of his suits are made of velvet. His favorite is Hanique velvet, produced by the Henpilon factory in Berlin, and it is also cheap. The middle and upper-class people of Germany can afford it, costing only about sixty-some legal tender yuan. Mussolini, because he came from a poor background, still likes to wear that gray-blue general's uniform, even though he is now a noble prime minister. The texture is not particularly noble. As for formal wear or casual wear, he only wears it occasionally, except for banquets with relatives or horse rides for excursions. President Chiang usually wears long gowns. The gown material is ordinary wool fabric, with only a few more valuable formal dresses! His general's uniform and suit are worn depending on the time and nature of the occasion. However, his raw materials are always domestic, and there is not a single imported item. Stalin likes to wear serge, which is the opposite of Hitler's temperament. It is estimated that most of his clothes are made of domestic raw materials, with fewer foreign goods. Among his military and casual wear, wool fabrics are in the majority, and he mostly wears military uniforms.

Food

Hitler likes to eat sweet things and hates stimulating foods the most. It is said that this is because the doctor has tested his physique and found it extremely unsuitable. However, after each meal, he likes to eat a lot of fruit. I remember that in the summer of the year before last, when he was vacationing in Wonita City, he ate seven apples at once after a certain meal, which caused him a very serious gastrointestinal illness, and it took more than a month to recover! Mussolini's eating habits are the opposite of Hitler's. He likes stimulating flavors, and almost every dish has this flavor. He loves to eat ear gristle shark (produced in South Africa and the Malay Archipelago) and wild rabbit and other animal meats. President Chiang's meals consist of no more than five or six dishes per meal. We know that some wealthy families must eat delicacies from mountains and seas, and they are even more extravagant at banquets. When we see President Chiang's virtues of thrift and diligence, we should deeply be alarmed and awakened. President Chiang likes to eat Jinling salted duck and Jinhua ham. His meals are entirely in the Fenghua style of his hometown. Stalin loves salty flavors and eats all kinds of wild animal meats. He also likes birds. The tender meat of seahorses and elk is best suited to his appetite. He always uses it to accompany his meals once or twice a week.

Housing

Mussolini and President Chiang have some similar personalities. They both like quietness and cleanliness. The furnishings in the house only need to be simple and aesthetically pleasing, not too luxurious. It is best if they can have a kind of rural flavor. Speaking of Hitler's and Stalin's private residences, they are very luxurious. Hitler's official residence is the world-famous Nymphenburg, while Stalin's villa on the banks of the Yauza River in Moscow is more luxurious, but his official residence is very ordinary.

Transportation

If we infer their behavior based on each person's personality, it is quite accurate. Like Mussolini and Hitler, they like to hunt and fish because they love to eat animal meat. President Chiang likes to climb mountains and visit historical sites. He also diligently and tirelessly studies state affairs on weekdays. As for theaters and restaurants, he will never go there unless absolutely necessary. Stalin likes to watch plays, ride horses, and swim. He loves horseback riding even more, because he has been accustomed to military life since childhood, so horseback riding has become his hobby.

### Should the Black Market for Foreign Exchange Be Maintained?

— Shi Weitao

Since the outbreak of the war, almost all of China's original treaty ports have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army; and the attempt to control the economy has also followed. The establishment of the United Reserve Bank of North China and the Huaxing Bank, the issuance of counterfeit money, and the attempt to replace the circulation of legal tender are all enough to show the magnitude of its ambitions. However, the fact that it has not proceeded as smoothly as originally planned to this day is mainly due to the consolidated foundation of the legal tender, which is widely trusted by the people, and even hoarded by the masses as cash. After receiving Japanese and puppet banknotes, they are used out at any time, which should be one of the main reasons. The reason why legal tender can gain the trust of the people is due to the unreliability of the counterfeit currency itself, and the people's trust in the government. Maintaining the exchange rate of the open market in Shanghai (the so-called black market), so that legal tender can freely buy and sell foreign exchange at any time, will undoubtedly have indelible achievements. Recently, it has been rumored in the market that the Exchange Stabilization Fund will no longer maintain the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange. However, the gain or loss between maintaining and abandoning it is of great importance. Therefore, I will not hesitate to discuss and study it from my limited perspective.

Before discussing whether the black market for foreign exchange should be maintained, please first compare the advantages and disadvantages of the current maintenance policy.

Advantages: (1) The biggest function of maintaining the black market for foreign exchange is to enable legal tender to be exchanged for foreign exchange at any time, enhance people's faith, and resist the invasion of Japanese and puppet banknotes. After a large number of Japanese and puppet banknotes invade, they can increase the issuance of banknotes as military expenses, reduce the burden on their own country, use them as funds for developing enterprises, and use the resources of the guerrilla areas. The benefits gained by the Japanese side may exceed those obtained from arbitrage in the current foreign exchange market. (2) It can preserve the commercial interests of friendly countries and win the favor of foreigners.

Disadvantages: (1) Because the buying and selling of foreign exchange is unrestricted, the Japanese side can freely obtain foreign exchange with the legal tender they have plundered. (2) It has created a huge trade deficit in Shanghai, and the imported goods such as cotton and wheat are needed by the Japanese side and are not what the people need. Therefore, there is a drawback that the foreign exchange fund is transferred to the hands of the Japanese, which must be prevented.

To sum up, the policy of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to maintain the black market is indeed impeccable. However, the unrestricted policy has created the heartbreaking phenomenon of funds flowing into the hands of the Japanese, which must be improved. Recently, there have been many articles in newspapers and magazines discussing this, and I have compiled them for discussion.

1.  Do not maintain the black market for foreign exchange, let it rise and fall on its own, and find its own level. This means that the Exchange Stabilization Fund will stop supplying foreign exchange to the black market. Under normal circumstances, there is no need to supply the Shanghai foreign exchange market, because the balance of imports and exports can stabilize the exchange rate. In other words, the demand of exporters for legal tender is equal to the supply of importers, so legal tender can maintain its normal state. Over the years, although Shanghai has often been a trade deficit port, it has been reduced to about four pence according to the current exchange rate. The price of foreign goods has soared, the people's demand for foreign goods has naturally decreased, and exports have increased sharply due to the benefit of the exchange rate, making it easy to find its own level. However, the environment in Shanghai is unusual. The need for foreign exchange not only comes from importers; most of it is from the Japanese side who are desperately grabbing foreign exchange in the foreign exchange black market with the legal tender they have plundered; and the large number of foreign cotton orders from Japanese yarn factories. (Since the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, it may be reduced, but it still needs to be proven by figures.) May I ask, under such circumstances, coupled with the turmoil in the financial market and the people's craze for buying foreign exchange and gold, can the foreign exchange earned from Shanghai's exports meet the needs of the market? If the Exchange Stabilization Fund stops maintaining it, the Japanese will buy foreign exchange in the market at any price with the legal tender they have plundered, in order to destroy the credit of legal tender; coupled with the fueling of speculators and the blind purchase of foreign exchange and gold by the blind, the consequences will be disastrous. Although the value of legal tender in the interior will not be reduced due to the changes in the Shanghai black market; the result may be that a large amount of legal tender flows into the interior, forming a gratifying phenomenon of capital flowing backwards, but when legal tender gradually flows into the interior, I am afraid that Japanese and puppet banknotes will also invade, and the so-called "East Asian Economic Cooperative System" that the Japanese have dreamed of will be realized. After all, it is definitely not something we can agree with. Shanghai is a fortress to prevent the Japanese from controlling the economy of the guerrilla areas and must be fully guarded.

2.  Import and export firms and foreign exchange banks organize foreign exchange clearing houses to implement a self-sufficient system. This kind of suggestion is valuable if it is implemented in peacetime. However, under the current situation, there are many difficulties. For example, when the Japanese buy foreign exchange at a higher price, there must be brave men under heavy rewards. Can export firms not be tempted by profits and strictly abide by selling foreign exchange to the clearing houses? Then, will the price of the clearing houses fall with the price offered by the Japanese? But the legal tender held by the Japanese can be sold at any price, and will the price of the clearing houses fall infinitely with it? Moreover, Shanghai is now in a huge trade deficit, and without a huge fund, how can the clearing houses achieve a balance? All of these are obstacles to the establishment of clearing houses.

3.  Foreign exchange approval system, that is, the current foreign exchange approval system in the interior is also implemented in Shanghai to supply foreign exchange for necessities. Such as rice, coal and other daily necessities for ordinary people, restricting the import of non-necessities and enemy-supporting items. The price should be slightly lower than the seven pence in the interior, or around the current new level of four pence. Then, the cost is not high, and the livelihood of the common people can be stabilized a lot. According to my speculation, the following points can occur as a result.

(1) The black market still exists. Regarding this point, Mr. Gong Jialin said in his article "Post-War Shanghai's Foreign Trade and Trade Deficit Problems in the Banking Industry": "The official price of one shilling and two and a half pence is used for buying and selling, and restrictions are implemented, so the so-called current foreign exchange black market has emerged. If this kind of black market trading is further restricted, the result will be the emergence of a second black market. The exchange rate of this black market will of course be lower than the newly set price. As a result, foreign exchange suppliers will definitely sell their foreign exchange in this second black market. As a result, won't the government-controlled banks only have foreign exchange sales but no purchases? Once verified by the situation of the foreign exchange black market since the establishment of the Exchange Stabilization Fund in early March, it can be seen that the Exchange Stabilization Fund is also often in the supply position. The result is ultimately payment. Instead of this, it is better to use an application system to stabilize the prices of general necessities with a limited number and stabilize people's hearts. To prevent the Japanese from arbitrage, the Exchange Stabilization Fund constantly shrinks the price, causing the entire financial market to become chaotic, and the prices of general civilian necessities also rise in proportion to luxury goods, affecting the livelihoods of the common people.

(2) The foreign exchange that the Japanese can arbitrage will be greatly reduced. Because the Japanese must wait until the supply of foreign exchange is greater than the needs of importers before they can obtain it. And each approved supply of foreign exchange cannot be arbitraged.

(3) Finance can be more stable. Because the approval system is adopted, no matter what policy the Japanese adopt in the second black market to buy foreign exchange at a high price. General necessities will not rise in price because foreign exchange is available. The psychology of the general public hoarding gold bars, foreign currency, and stockpiling goods will be greatly reduced. Because most people who buy gold bars and foreign currency are concerned about the unlimited fall of legal tender in order to preserve personal assets.

(4) Strengthen the tendency of capital inflow. Because the stipulated price in Shanghai is lower than that in the interior, it is more profitable to remit to the interior. Since the outbreak of the war, capital has flocked to Shanghai and stayed there, which is a pity. The difference in exchange rates and the high cost of remittance may be of some help in promoting it. However, if speculation and arbitrage trading in Shanghai are not curbed, I am afraid there will be no great effect. Because the interest on arbitrage is high, up to one or two cents. It is almost comparable to loan sharking, but the procedures are simple and the risk is minimal. It is inevitable that capital will be attracted by it. As mentioned above, the implementation of the approval system can reduce the Japanese's arbitrage opportunities compared with the current policies of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, and can also reduce the expenditure of the Exchange Stabilization Fund; and it is not necessary to take emergency measures from time to time to make the exchange rate plummet and make people panic. However, compared with the policy of resolutely not maintaining it, it is more stable and there is no danger of Japanese and puppet banknotes invading. Because maintaining the policy requires the expenditure of funds, which has no direct benefit to our resistance war. But it is also enough to prevent the Japanese from attempting to control the economy and reduce their opportunities to use the resources of the guerrilla areas. Indirectly, it is of great help to the resistance war. Therefore, under the current situation, it is more appropriate to adopt the approval system.

### Postal Stamp Issues

— Xie Liangxian

Since Mr. So-and-so brought up the issue of postal stamps, it has attracted a great deal of attention. This is because the number of postal stamps in circulation in Shanghai is very large, and their function is to replace subsidiary currency. In other words, postal stamps have become a kind of non-principal currency. However, postal stamps inherently lack the characteristics of currency. According to their nature, postal stamps serve as proof of advance payment for labor services. From the perspective of the purchaser, they are similar to deferred assets; conversely, for the issuer, the stamps represent a liability to be offset by the provision of labor services. Therefore, it is unprecedented, and indeed very difficult and contrary to regulations, to redeem postal stamps for cash—legal tender—or other substitute currency. However, the use of postal stamps as subsidiary currency in the market is an undeniable fact. Many people who previously had no need for postal stamps now have some. As Mr. So-and-so said, merchants generally have a dozen or so yuan's worth of stamps, and even peddlers often have a matchbox full.

In the near future, the issuance of new subsidiary currency will signal the end of the use of postal stamps. Moreover, the use of postal stamps was adopted by people for convenience, so their termination does not require any explicit order and will be immediately met with rejection. Furthermore, if the use of postal stamps is not stopped, according to Gresham's Law, the new currency cannot circulate. As a result, merchants who hold postal stamps will become averse to them, as they represent an excessive accumulation of idle assets, and they will eagerly seek to get rid of them. On the other hand, the demand elasticity for postal stamps is very low. We will certainly not use more matches just because matches are cheaper; similarly, we will not write more letters just because there are too many postal stamps. Consequently, these postal stamps will simply become surplus in society. Although their price may not be as greatly affected by supply and demand as other commodities, the public's aversion to them is sufficient to cause their value to fall. The fact that it is now common to buy 105 or even 115 fen for one yuan is clear evidence of this. This causes the public to suffer widespread unexpected losses. In terms of the ability to bear the burden, the most severely affected are the peddlers, creating the most economically unfair situation. Moreover, the postal stamps circulating in the market are mostly soiled and damaged due to frequent handling. According to the strict regulations regarding damaged postal stamps, aren't people essentially using waste paper as currency? This is really too dangerous! In other words, it should be remedied.

However, to make postal stamps flow from the market to another place, there must be attraction. The attraction is none other than redemption, and the redeemer must have the driving force of attraction as a necessary condition. That is, there must be financial resources. However, as mentioned above, postal stamps cannot be redeemed, so who will redeem them? This requires considerable consideration. It is of course not acceptable to simply write out my opinion, but it is no more than an ignorant offering.

I think the best way to redeem postal stamps is to exchange them for new subsidiary currency at the time of the new currency's issuance. This is like re-issuing promissory notes. Ideally, for the benefit of the people, the exchange should be at full value, but in reality, it would be acceptable to set a discount rate that reduces the public's losses, taking into account social conditions. This is because there is already sufficient evidence of price declines in the market for statistical purposes, and this would encourage postal stamps to leave the market through other channels, avoiding a lot of trouble. The difficulty, then, lies in how the bank issuing the new subsidiary currency will dispose of these postal stamps. First, we must recognize that postal stamps, if not redeemed by the post office, are essentially waste paper. To avoid conflicting with postal regulations, it would be best for the issuer of subsidiary currency to collaborate with the post office to use these postal stamps as collateral for loans, or as a form of rediscounting similar to promissory notes. An agreement should be made for repayment in installments, with the interest waived entirely. After all, it is the central bank's responsibility to incur some losses in order to adjust the currency! The post office, on the other hand, can repay part of the loan and destroy part of the soiled and damaged postal stamps. The losses incurred in printing costs can be compensated by the central bank's discount rate earnings. The repayment funds can be allocated from income, because the post office's accounting is clearly inaccurate, and the cost of labor services in accounting must be too high. In this special situation, a portion of the income is the result of labor services. Moreover, the amount of inaccuracy must correspond to the quantity of postal stamps issued for use as currency. Therefore, it is reasonable to allocate a portion of the income as a debt repayment reserve. This can also correct accounting errors, showing the true financial situation, which is truly killing two birds with one stone.

### The Future of the Japanese Economy (Continued 4)

— Translated by Feng Meiqi'an

This shows the importance of foreign markets to the stability of the Japanese economy. These foreign markets supply Japan with four-sevenths of its imports and purchase a little more than one-third of its exports, providing foreign exchange. Among these foreign markets, Germany and Italy are less important. In 1938, they supplied Japan with approximately 185 million yen worth of goods and purchased 40 million yen of its exports. The Tripartite Pact (including "Manchukuo") may slightly increase this number, but the increase will not be significant. If a European war occurs, regardless of whether Japan is involved, trade with the Axis powers will be automatically cut off.

Japan's trade with the United Kingdom is far greater than with Germany. In 1938, the approximate figures were: the United Kingdom supplied Japan with goods worth approximately 550 million yen, and Japan's exports to the United Kingdom were approximately 630 million yen. Adding France, the Netherlands, and their colonies, these figures rise to 675 million and 800 million, or two-fifths of Japan's foreign trade. If trade relations with these three countries are severed, Japan will suffer a heavy blow. In Southeast Asia, in 1938, French Indochina, British Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies supplied Japan with goods worth a total of 155 million yen and purchased 110 million yen of its exports. If the Japanese could control these colonies, their gains in oil, rubber, tin, and iron ore would be greater than current trade figures. On the other hand, if war damages oil wells, it will greatly affect their production. The difficulties Germany faced in organizing Romanian oil production during the Great War serve as a precedent. Therefore, Japan must plan for this in advance. If it can quickly gain control, the economic benefits gained are often significant. However, these colonies cannot supply Japan's huge needs for raw cotton, machinery, manufactured metal products, various minerals, and non-metals. (To be continued)

### Inadequate Understanding Among Foreign Exchange Speculators

— Gong Jialin

The Activity of Foreign Exchange Speculation

Since the Exchange Stabilization Fund suspended its supply of foreign exchange on the black market last month for the second time, in just a few days, the unofficial exchange rate has fallen from six and a half pence to just over four pence. Last week, rumors that the government had ordered the printing of 100 million yuan worth of banknotes in England caused panic in society, which speculators exploited to manipulate the market, causing both official and unofficial rates to shrink into the four-pence range, creating an unprecedentedly tight situation on the foreign exchange black market.

In fact, regarding the printing of a huge amount of new banknotes, even without definite confirmation from the government and related parties, we can judge from common sense that it is nonsense. We can ask ourselves: if the government really wanted to adopt inflation, would this highly secret and important information be casually leaked out? Even the most careless person would not be so negligent. This news is clearly either a misrepresentation or someone spreading rumors to cause harm. This is something we can understand.

However, the tendency towards speculation and capital flight has intensified. According to market estimates, more than 90 percent of recent foreign exchange transactions are due to this improper need. Previously, foreign exchange speculation was limited to wealthy individuals and those familiar with finance, but now even ordinary people with small savings are becoming active. This situation is undoubtedly quite serious.

The most fundamental reason why the activities of speculators and capital flight operators have become so heated recently is that they do not have a sufficient understanding of the true value of the legal tender. People in Shanghai, who have been living in a semi-occupied area for a long time, often have the misconception that the exchange rate on the open market represents the value of the legal tender. Two months ago, when the legal tender's black market exchange rate stabilized at 8.25 pence, they regarded the legal tender as worth 60% of its official value (based on the official rate of 14.5 pence). Now that it has fallen below 4 pence, it is not even worth 30%. According to this logic, has the value of the legal tender fallen by more than two times after only two months? Is this even possible? This kind of thinking is extremely wrong!

In a country with strict exchange controls, the emergence of a black market is unavoidable; however, in countries where the government has complete control, it is easier to suppress the black market, so its scope and power are relatively smaller. Shanghai, the financial center of our country, is already a part of the occupied area, and the government does not have complete power to control Shanghai's foreign exchange market, resulting in such a rampant black market situation. This is something we acknowledge, but we cannot use this local situation to represent the whole of China. In the complete regions of China, imports and exports of goods are still calculated according to the official exchange rate stipulated by the government. Can we say that the legal tender has fallen in value? Furthermore, isn't the Japanese yen in Shanghai now worth less than 4 pence? Why do we still say that Japan is maintaining the legal exchange rate?

Or, some people use the increase in the number of legal tender issued after the war as proof that the currency's value has fallen. It is true that the amount of legal tender issued has increased from more than 445 million yuan before the war in July to the recently announced 2.6 billion yuan, an increase of slightly less than 1.2 billion yuan. However, this increase should be attributed to a natural trend rather than financial needs. Since the reform of the currency system in November 1935, the amount of legal tender issued has gradually increased due to the collection of gold and silver, the exchange of miscellaneous banknotes, and the unification of the currency system. In November 1935, the amount issued was 570 million yuan, which increased to more than 1 billion yuan in less than two years by July 1937 before the war, almost tripling. This was not considered inflation at the time. This process continued after the war, and there was a special need to stimulate finance in the interior. It is clear that the slight increase in the issuance of legal tender in the past two years cannot be rashly regarded as inflation.

Or, some people cite the rising prices of goods in the interior as an excuse for the substantial decline in the purchasing power of the legal tender. In fact, this is a mistake due to insufficient observation. The rise in prices in the interior is limited to a few major cities, and the "luxury goods" that are not produced locally have risen particularly sharply. This is because a large number of relatively wealthy people have moved from occupied cities to interior cities, and the production capacity of the interior cities has failed to adapt. In most rural areas, however, prices have not increased much, which is something we need to understand. In the occupied cities, the increase in prices is mainly due to transportation obstacles and increased taxes. Once we win the final victory and restore order, the purchasing power of the legal tender will not only recover immediately, but will also be greatly enhanced.

The second mistake in understanding that speculators have made is to assume that the current exchange rate will only shrink and that there is no hope of rebound. Therefore, everyone is desperately going long, buying near and selling far, so that the exchange rate shrinks day by day. However, according to our speculation, this trend will definitely not last long. At this low exchange rate of 3.5 pence, almost all importers have been squeezed out, and the remaining demanders are only speculators going long and foolish capital flight operators. The power of the long side is definitely not unlimited. As the government strengthens the tightening of currency chips in the Shanghai market and the unreasonable difference between the true purchasing power of the legal tender and the market exchange rate increases, the long speculators will eventually collapse. By that time, it may be too late to rush to make a profit.

There is one more point that speculators should be aware of: although the Exchange Stabilization Fund has now abandoned maintaining the Shanghai black market, it does not mean that it will completely let it go. The Exchange Stabilization Fund can consider the situation and use its huge economic power to sanction the black market and punish speculative activities. This is not impossible.

The Due Awareness of Speculators

Speculation is a kind of gambling, so-called "profit" is of course unreliable. There are countless people who have lost their fortunes in this, and speculating in this volatile exchange market is indeed dangerous. At this time, whether for the benefit of the country or for personal benefit, there is no reason not to immediately reinvest this capital into production in the interior. Here are four reasons:

(1) When investing in production in the interior, you can still obtain foreign exchange at the legal exchange rate when purchasing necessary foreign production tools and raw materials.

(2) Industry and commerce in the interior are underdeveloped. Generally, investing in these virgin lands will bring high profits and great development potential.

(3) Government protection is complete and there are incentive measures. It is much more reliable than speculating on foreign exchange or investing in the occupied areas.

(4) Today, remitting funds from Shanghai to the interior not only does not require commission, but also provides generous subsidies. However, we believe that this is only a temporary phenomenon. Investors must not lose this opportunity.

In short, we believe that doing foreign exchange speculation and foreign exchange savings work in the current situation is an extremely boring thing. This unwise action of harming others and oneself should be stopped immediately, and this useful capital should be transferred to the interior to directly engage in production, or deposited in legal tender in interior banks to indirectly engage in production.

Commercial News

### Finance: The Disparity Between Cash Inflow and Outflow is Widening

Yesterday, the unofficial cash market was closed due to the weekly holiday. It was reported that trading outside the market initially occurred at the previous afternoon's closing price of 4,555 yuan, with a small number of transactions. Later in the morning, buyers raised the price to 4,560 yuan, but there were still no buyers. The exchange rate for gold jewelry from silverware shops remained at the original price of 460 yuan at the Da Tong Bank, and 458 yuan at the Xin Tong Bank. The purchase price had to be reduced by more than ten to twenty yuan. Furthermore, according to a London cable on the 19th, the price of English pure gold remained at £7 8s 7d per ounce. According to a London cable on the 19th, the silver market saw purchases from India and speculators, with a shortage of supply, resulting in a stable market. Large bars of silver saw an increase of 0.0625 in the near term and a further increase of 0.125 in the long term. The New York and Mumbai silver prices were closed and there were no cables.

### Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar is in Short Supply

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The guild's listed prices for spot and refined white sugar remained unchanged. The price at this company was 40.3 yuan, while at other companies it was 40 yuan, and 32 yuan for transit sugar. The price of Taikoo refined white sugar was down by one cent. East China Company's B mark was 44 yuan, West China Company's 44.4 yuan, CW mark 44.1 yuan, CX mark 43.8 yuan, DY mark 43.4 yuan, HX mark 43.2 yuan. HX mark refined red sugar increased by 1.5 yuan to 27.5 yuan. Dutch red spot sugar was 35 yuan, transit sugar 28.5 yuan, with no other changes. There was increased demand for domestic sugar, but no actual transactions had taken place. East China red sugar was quoted at 32 yuan, Gao Diao green sugar at 27 yuan, and Zheng Mian red sugar at 41 yuan.

### Seafood: New Golden Hooks from Guanli Already Sold

New golden hook tails from Yantai Guanli have arrived in Shanghai. The quality and color are excellent and suitable for sales in this street. The opening price was 210 yuan to 220 yuan and has already been transacted.

### Domestic Dried Shrimp: New Goods are Difficult to Develop

New dried shrimp from Yantai have just entered the market. Recently, a batch has arrived, and the brand name is asking for over 70 yuan, but certain goods on the market are abundant and only selling for 68 yuan. Buyers mostly seek to be cheap, so sales are quite restricted and no transactions have been completed.

### Hardware: Iron Nails Rise Again

Although yesterday was Sunday, hardware transactions were not quiet. Among them, the market for iron nails was quite lively. Purchasers from the local construction gangs were the largest. The Tianjin gangs also purchased one to two hundred barrels. However, the shipping date must be Monday (today). The price of "Double Times" forks has risen sharply, with an increase of 2-3 yuan. The current market price is 34 yuan to 35 yuan per barrel. As a result, the factory's production is unusually crowded.

Wire nails are as attractive as iron nails, but the business is not as prosperous as iron nails. The amount purchased by the Tianjin gangs is also close to one hundred barrels. Standard prices continue to rise, such as 57 yuan for 3-inch nails, 54 yuan for 4-inch nails, 53 yuan for 5-inch nails, and 52 yuan for 6-inch nails.

### The Current Difficulties of the Shanghai Silk Industry (Continued)

— Qu Yang

(2) The crisis in the Shanghai silk industry is an inevitable process before victory, especially now that the War of Resistance is approaching its second stage!

The Future of Silk Industry Development Lies in Victory

The future development of the silk industry lies on the road to national liberation and victory. In other words, it is the eve of victory in the War of Resistance, which is also the winter season for the silk industry. I remember that in mid-November last year, there was an article in the economic supplement of this newspaper describing various aspects of the silk industry after the war. One section seemed to be about:

"...The future of China's industry, the future of China's silk industry, has only two paths. One is to engage in the national liberation revolution with great effort and sacrifice, in order to win the freedom to develop and strive to dominate the world. The other is to simply surrender, allowing others to "cooperatively develop" in a semi-colonial manner, turning ourselves into fertilizer to prolong their lives..."

At the same time, the future fate of the silk industry was estimated as follows:

"The rise of our country's national industry is the result of this decisive War of Resistance. The final victory of the War of Resistance... is also the time when our country's industry will flourish, and our country's silk industry will once again dominate the world. Our country is an agricultural country, and the emerging industries after victory will push our country into a new era. The silkworm enterprise is an integrated system of agriculture and industry, so this new era is undoubtedly a favorable period for the unprecedented renaissance of our country's silk industry..."

This is an accurate conclusion that everyone agrees with. However, why does this article say that the crisis in the Shanghai silk industry is an inevitable process? It is precisely because this decisive war is the upward development of Chinese national capital. Before victory arrives, the industry left behind within its sphere of influence will inevitably be tightly suppressed, in order to become the capital it hopes to use for "war to support war."

After the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the Shanghai silk industry became a sitting duck. However, it was still because Shanghai possessed many special conditions that it was said that the control of the Shanghai silk industry and the entire silk industry in the occupied areas had to be divided into several steps. This rumor, coupled with the truth that has been revealed in the past and at present, is that the inclusion of the Shanghai silk industry is probably about to arrive at the time of implementing the treatment of separation.

Inevitable Economic Points of Attack

Due to the fact that the quick victory and the high-profile century of war did not help, and the war has been forced to the second stage, they found the slogan "using war to support war" to pay checks to the country and cash them in the occupied areas. The attack on the silk industry was to launch a very severe lockdown on the Shanghai silk industry, following the "control" of Wuxi and the silkworm silk around the Shanghai-Nanjing line. It blocked the import of raw materials and the export of finished products.

Because the Shanghai silk industry itself has had many shortcomings in the past two years, there are gaps to exploit. The way to attack is to take a two-pronged approach of threats and inducements, deception and intimidation. Now let's take a look at the event of purchasing spring cocoons!

When the spring silkworms were about to go into the cocoon, the news came out that everyone was refused to go to the inland to collect cocoons, including third-country merchants. At this time, the Shanghai silk industry was filled with a pessimistic atmosphere. However, soon the news came out that everyone was allowed to go to collect orchids unconditionally. At this time, the mentality of the Shanghai silk industry changed from pessimism to luck, and luck turned into adventure. Therefore, more than 30 million yuan of funds were mobilized, and after the passes were sent to the interior, the cocoon collection was completed. Then, all were detained without any accommodation. However, soon it was shown that gold is omnipotent, as long as the conditions are agreeable, it can pass. This strategy is an old trick, that is, first make it despair, and then slightly relax to cultivate its psychology of compromise. Therefore, fresh cocoons shipped to Shanghai were first detained, and then the "tax issues" were carefully weighed. However, as it has developed to the present, it is honestly discussing confiscating 50% and releasing 50%. But in fact, a large number of fresh cocoons are still kept on the traffic lines in the occupied areas. (To be continued)

### Travel Guide to America

— Inquiries

As autumn approaches, students preparing to study in the United States are making arrangements for their departures. Although the number of students going to the US this year is not as large as in previous years due to the soaring exchange rate, it is still considerable. While details regarding the procedures for studying in the US and the journey itself have been extensively covered in this publication, many who are initially deciding to go to the US remain largely unfamiliar with life and everything else in that country. To facilitate students studying abroad, as well as those preparing to travel or conduct academic research in the US, the author will provide a brief report on various aspects of life there, including clothing, food, housing, and transportation, for reference.

US Time Zone Standards

Due to the differences in longitude between the east and west coasts of the United States, there are significant distinctions in timekeeping. Therefore, time standards are divided into four zones. The eastern states use "Eastern Time," the central states use "Central Time," the western states use "Mountain Time," and the far western states use "Pacific Time." Major cities in the east and central regions, such as New York, Boston, and Chicago, use "Daylight Saving Time" in the summer, which is one hour ahead of standard time, and revert back in the fall. Railway, bus, and ship timetables, as well as clocks in stations, use standard time throughout the year, without adjusting for summer. Those initially deciding to go to the US should take note of this.

US-Canada Border

Students or travelers to the US cannot enter Canada unless they have completed the necessary procedures in advance. Those going to the eastern United States often visit Niagara Falls. This place is located on the border between the US and Canada, with a long bridge in between. Americans can visit the Canadian side of the falls without restrictions, but if Chinese nationals are not careful, they may cross the bridge without going through US immigration, which can cause a lot of trouble when returning. If you can produce your passport, you may be allowed to return, but often you will be detained for several days until the Chinese Embassy in Washington can provide verification via telegram before being released. This point should be given special attention. If you wish to cross the bridge for sightseeing, you should present your passport to the immigration authorities at the bridgehead in advance, which may be successful. Although there are beautiful sights to see in Canada, smaller nations cannot enjoy them under unequal treatment. In Detroit, Michigan, there are also tunnels and ships connecting to Canada, and the situation there is similar to Niagara. This also requires attention. (To be continued)

### ### Shaanxi Province: Dedicated to Transportation Construction

Xi'an Dispatch: The Shaanxi provincial government, recognizing the urgency of passenger and freight transportation, is now focusing on transportation construction. According to responsible officials, Shaanxi Province has three major transportation construction projects underway: (1) The highway from Xianyang north to Tongguan, totaling 139 kilometers, is under construction and is expected to be completed by March next year. (2) The light railway from Baoji southwest through Fengxian to Shuangshipu, totaling 108 kilometers, is a joint project of the Longhai Railway and the provincial government and will also be completed soon. Freight transport methods are currently being planned. In the future, it is planned to extend the railway to Weixian in Gansu Province to reach the Baishui River. (3) The waterway from the Baishui River into the Jialing River, going south to Guangyuan in Sichuan, serves as a transportation link between Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces, with a total length of 330 kilometers. The Shaanxi Construction Department is actively organizing the river channel and repairing the towpaths, which are expected to be completed in November.

### A Plea from Elementary School Teachers

— (Yin Ran and 14 Others)

Oppose Increasing Tuition to Raise Salaries

Upon receiving a letter from a group of elementary school teachers, we also received an article by Mr. Yin Ran and others titled "Oppose Increasing Tuition to Raise Salaries." We indeed sympathize with the difficult lives of elementary school teachers, but increasing tuition to raise salaries is not a proper solution. Therefore, it is published here together. - Editor

The fall semester has begun, and many schools are preparing to open. At this time, many school teachers are requesting salary increases from the school authorities due to the high cost of living in the isolated island, which is insufficient to support a family. However, the school authorities say that their finances are tight, creating a difficult situation. Some people suggest increasing tuition to remedy the situation. This issue is worth discussing because it is not just a matter of teachers' livelihoods, but the development of the entire education sector. We, 14 elementary school teachers, are willing to express our honest opinions and ask the editor to grant us a small space to inform the public.

The number of elementary schools on the isolated island after the war is twice as many as before the war. Due to the complexity of the composition and background, tuition fees also vary greatly. The tuition fee for the senior grades in school A is often six or seven yuan, while the tuition fee for the senior grades in school B is 20 to 30 yuan. Although the income of the two schools is uneven, the treatment of teachers is the same. It goes without saying that the low income of school A affects the meager treatment of teachers, while the principal of school B sees the school as a business, only knows how to seek profit, and fills his personal pockets. On the one hand, he further lowers the treatment of teachers. In addition to calculating each semester as five months, there are also other harsh treatments with 80% or 90% discounts. As a result, how can teachers maintain the lives of several family members with a meager salary of 20 or 30 yuan per month, while the principal himself lives in high-rise buildings and indulges in entertainment venues, not knowing what "education" means. As for the problem that the meager treatment of our teachers is not enough to maintain a family life, it is definitely not possible to increase our salaries and get real benefits after increasing tuition fees. On the contrary, it will only make the principal's pockets more solid. The principal can't wait for the teachers to shout out the slogan of "increasing tuition fees to raise salaries," which is like a second landlord can't wait for the big landlord to shout "increase rent." But what is the result? It is still the general elementary school students who suffer. Due to the increase in tuition fees, their parents cannot afford it and have to drop out of school, causing batches of elementary school students to go to the out-of-school group. Isn't it a pity! Isn't this shaking the entire education sector and the future of the country? For the future of the country and the development of education, we vow not to increase tuition fees. We loudly shout "oppose increasing tuition fees to raise salaries."

We sincerely hope that enthusiastic people in society can provide us with a proper solution, and we hope that the principals can examine their conscience and run education well!

### Letter from a Group of Elementary School Teachers

We are elementary school teachers. When we discovered that some of our difficult lives had been revealed in the article "Part of the Faculty and Staff Call for a Salary Increase" published on the 15th of your newspaper, we couldn't help but shed tears of emotion. In fact, there are more than thousands of people in the maritime education sector who are living the same life as us, and it is not just us who are so excited!

Indeed, the lives of our elementary school teachers are too bitter. They were bitter in ordinary times, even more bitter after the "August 13 Incident," but the degree of hardship after the recent foreign exchange drop and price surge has reached its highest point. In this situation, it is impossible for us to ask for a stable life. While we are shouting "kitten, white horse" to the students, we have to worry about firewood, rice, oil, and salt for today. How can this contradiction in life be unified? Save money! But the expenses of our elementary school teachers are not many, or even none; but we have to eat, we have to rent a house, and sometimes we have to add a piece or two of clothing (most school authorities think that the clothing is too shabby, which will affect the children's coming to school). As a result, the problem is still not solved. There are many people in society who lament the low level of students and the irresponsibility of teachers. These may all be facts, but they have overlooked another fact: teachers cannot be responsible when they are hungry and cold.

Because we want to do something with peace of mind, the movement to ask for a salary increase is always brewing, but it is only brewing. There has never been a day to formally express it to the school authorities. Everyone knows that there are many unemployed people in society now, and it is not difficult to replace a new batch of teachers; at the same time, when the whole country is sincerely united to overcome the national crisis, we should not cause any internal disputes that are enough to distract our strength. However, the threat to life is more severe than any threat, so many people have raised such a question: "Are we going to be elementary school teachers forever? Where is the destination of life?" Under such questions, teachers worry about their current lives every day, and always worry about their future prospects. As a result, the job of elementary school teacher has become a ladder for everyone to transfer to other jobs. In this way, what kind of situation will the future education sector form! This is indeed a serious crisis in the education sector! We say that this is a crisis in the education sector because although we may not be education-supremeists who "educate for education," we are particularly close to education and have particularly deep feelings. We have no power to solve this crisis, and we cannot bear to see this crisis continue to develop, so we respectfully ask the school authorities and people from all walks of life to issue a call to improve our lives!

We believe that our request to improve our lives is completely a legitimate request, and we also believe that this request can only be resolved perfectly if the school authorities and teachers proceed on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Based on this principle, we fully agree with the method proposed by more than 100 gentlemen, including Dai Yangren and Jin Jing, that "the school authorities should increase teachers' salaries by increasing tuition fees appropriately;" and propose that each school add voluntary classes, summer classes, economics classes, and remedial classes, and the education sector should establish a "Consumption Cooperative of Colleagues" (such a cooperative already exists, and the name is "Shanghai Elementary School Education Sector Consumption Cooperative") and a "Mutual Aid Association for the Livelihood of Faculty and Staff." Commercial circles can also help solve the problem by organizing a "Price Stabilization Association." We believe that this is not only a problem for our colleagues in the education sector, but also a problem for the entire education sector and the entire society. We deeply hope that people from all walks of life in society will express their opinions on this issue and jointly seek a quick and reasonable solution.

### Spring in the West

— Bai Hua

"Out West With The Hardys"

"Spring in the West" is the so-called Judge Hardy family film after "... Love... First Love" and "First Understanding of Love." In this family, the playwright created several typical characters: Judge Hardy (father), mother, Andrew (son), Mary (daughter), and Miley (aunt). However, as the main characters of each Judge Hardy film are Andrew and Mary, when the first two works were released, everyone pointed out that it was wrong to describe the love affairs of young daughters in a provocative manner, and its harm would be greater than other films that used pornography as a temptation. "Spring in the West" still takes the love affair of this pair of young daughters as the theme, but the playwright has corrected the mistakes of the past: For example, after Mary goes to the West, she falls in love with the shepherd Rhett Holt and asks her father to marry him. Hardy knows that it is a temporary emotional impulse of his daughter and only allows them to have a trial marriage first, so that they can gradually discover their own or each other's shortcomings in the common life of the trial, so as to avoid regret. This rational judgment -- instructing children to use the correct meaning of love, should be the merit of this Judge Hardy family film compared to the former.

Because the Judge Hardy family film is a box office success, MGM has fixed the "cast list" of this family: father (Lewis Stone), mother (Fay Holden), son (Mickey Rooney), daughter (Cecilia Parker), and aunt (Ann Rutherford). Among these five actors, Mickey Rooney is currently the most popular child star in Hollywood, so the directors of the Judge Hardy films have focused their efforts on him, and this "Spring in the West" is no exception.

For example, the following examples show Mickey Rooney's decadent and strong personality: (1) Mickey Rooney changed all his clothes, hoping to become a equestrian, and saw the shepherd walking with his legs bent, he also imitated, but when he rode on the horse, he fell terribly: (2) He stole to the pasture to ride a horse and put a rope on the front legs of "Calico" (horse name), but when he galloped, the man and horse turned over; (3) He gambled with Jackie (an eight-year-old western girl) on marksmanship, and Jackie shot a tin can into the air with five shots in a row, scaring Mickey Rooney to run away. The above scenes are all handled very vividly and interestingly, and clearly portray Mickey Rooney's personality.

Mickey Rooney's acting skills, from "Orphans' Paradise" to now, whether it is his facial expressions or actions, have been stereotyped, at least there is no new development; but his period as a child star is very short, which is detrimental to his future.

Here is also a discovery of an excellent child star, that is, Virginia Weidler, who plays Jackie. Her innocence, liveliness, sadness, and happiness are not artificial or pretentious, which is rare.

Lewis Stone, Fay Holden, and Cecilia Parker are all qualified.
