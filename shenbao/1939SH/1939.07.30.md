Another contingent of 400 to 500 troops crossed Nanbeishan Di and attacked and occupied Wu Jia Yu (east of Nanbeishan Di). Subsequently, Chinese troops reinforced the area in large numbers and launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese, with a portion flanking the Japanese rear. The Japanese troops, attacked on two sides by the Chinese, were unable to withstand the assault and retreated to their original positions, resisting stubbornly. The Chinese army is continuing its attack. In this battle, the Chinese army suffered 60 to 70 casualties, while the Japanese army's casualties were double that number. (Dispatch from the 29th)

The Japanese troops resisted stubbornly from the city, and fierce battles ensued. Under heavy Japanese infantry and artillery fire, a Chinese commando team of 31 soldiers at the Xiaonanmen bravely scaled the city walls and threw hand grenades into the city, killing many Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, Japanese reinforcements counterattacked, and more Chinese soldiers scaling the walls arrived and joined the battle. The fighting lasted until noon, when the Chinese troops retreated to their original positions, setting fire to the houses in the south gate area where the Japanese were relying on to resist. The Japanese troops in Qianjiang are extremely panicked and have cut down the nearby crops. (Dispatch from the 29th)

(Chongqing) According to news received here, Chinese troops in Hubei Province are gradually advancing towards Qianjiang in an attempt to counterattack this important town in Hubei that has been lost for a long time. It is understood that Chinese troops will be exceptionally active in the future. (Dispatch from Huitong News Agency on the 29th)

Nanyang: After occupying Huaminggang, a portion of the Japanese troops from Changtaiguan fled west on the 26th to the vicinity of Huaguodian (northeast of Tongbai).

Zhang Hui, the commander of the defense forces in that area, narrowly escaped danger several times. Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to land, but have been repulsed by Chinese troops, suffering several hundred casualties in recent days. Many shells have landed in farmland, so farmers have stopped harvesting. Japanese aircraft continue to strafe rural areas and pedestrians with machine guns. Residents continue to flock to Macau for refuge, and the gates of Macau remain open all night. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 29th)

Editorial

### China's Environment and the War of Resistance

In the past week, the situation in a corner of the Far East has been unusually tense, with the eyes of the world fixed on the area in amazement and surprise. The Chinese people, being directly involved in the situation, have inevitably experienced extreme psychological changes. Initially, the sharp depreciation of foreign exchange rates caused unusual anxiety and frustration. Then, the content of the preliminary Anglo-Japanese agreement was revealed, triggering widespread condemnation throughout China. However, when the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty was terminated, and news broke of the imminent termination of Anglo-Japanese commercial treaties, along with reports of a Soviet credit loan to China, the Chinese people suddenly became elated. Psychological anxiety, indignation, and excitement are all natural reactions, and there is no need to deliberately suppress them. However, given the current volatile situation and the prospect of even more significant developments, it is crucial for the Chinese people to exercise reason and pay close attention to the future of the situation while also experiencing elation.

The recent major events are all related to the Sino-Japanese War, but they also involve international relations. This can easily lead to the misconception that the key to the China problem lies entirely in international relations. This misconception suggests that the fate of China's War of Resistance is not in its own hands. In reality, while the China problem is closely related to global issues, China's destiny is not determined by others but is still in its own hands. In his recent weekly address, President Chiang Kai-shek made several famous statements: "This War of Resistance is a struggle to complete the revolution, and the revolution is absolutely unaffected by changes in the external environment." The Chinese people should deeply appreciate these words and understand that no matter how the environment changes, China's future remains in its own control.

President Chiang Kai-shek made these remarks when the Anglo-Japanese preliminary agreement was established, but they were not intended as a way to downplay Chinese disappointment. A leader of a nation and a people, especially a wise leader like President Chiang Kai-shek, does not need to offer mere excuses to his people. Rather, these statements are based on the painful experience accumulated over the past two years, which has led the Chinese people to believe that the success of the War of Resistance depends on being unaffected by the external environment. China does not need isolation, nor does it not need a favorable environment. So, what exactly is the relationship between China's War of Resistance and the environment? Negatively speaking, if the environment is not conducive, China does not need to change its stance. Positively speaking, all favorable environments cannot be created out of thin air, and China needs to resolutely strive for them with its determination and strength in the War of Resistance. When the war first started, there were sympathetic voices for China in the international community, but they were not enthusiastic or widespread enough. This was partly because even some genuine allies had their own internal conflicts, which prevented them from taking a positive stance on the Far East issue. However, the greater reason was that the world did not fully recognize China's determination and strength in the War of Resistance. The international community mistakenly believed that Japan's aggression would be limited or would respect the interests of third countries in China. At the same time, they mistakenly believed that China's War of Resistance might not be sustainable. Therefore, they hesitated, mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude and refraining from taking concrete action beyond expressing moral support. However, China implemented the War of Resistance regardless of everything and, in the process, built and strengthened itself, transforming itself from a chain of iron into steel. Simultaneously, in this process, it won the sympathy and support of various countries, gradually moving from moral resonance to practical support. This is an example of how China's War of Resistance does not depend on the environment but strives for it. It also proves the ancient wisdom of "Heaven helps those who help themselves" and "Those who are virtuous receive abundant assistance." If China had been preoccupied with gains and losses concerning the external environment from the beginning, it would not have made its current progress. Similarly, to strive for final victory, China today must not adopt a gain-or-loss attitude towards the environment and rely entirely on it.

Considering the current facts, what we consider as reasons for anxiety and indignation may not be without the potential to break the stalemate! For example, after a period of chaos, the foreign exchange market has gradually calmed down. Furthermore, while Britain has willingly recognized Japan's principles, the examination of concrete issues remains uncertain. Chamberlain is trying to reconcile the wording of the Anglo-Japanese agreement, believing himself to be complacent, but who knows if he will make a change of course? Conversely, things that are considered worth celebrating may not be without complications. Now that the United States has announced the termination of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, what will the next step be? If the Japanese side tries to ingratiate itself, how will the United States respond? Moreover, the world situation is constantly changing, and can we be certain that facts will not evolve to affect the Far East in any way? If the situation does not progress in a linear fashion, how will China handle itself? Therefore, the only answer is that China should adhere to its own stance, recognize its own path, and use unwavering determination to achieve its goal of resisting aggression and building the nation.

Furthermore, just as China used its determination and strength in the War of Resistance to gain international assistance, China in the future should use even greater determination and strength to gain even wider support from the world. In fact, China, which has grown during the two years of war resistance, is far superior to what it was two years ago in terms of military, economic, and political aspects. There is no reason why it cannot gain even greater assistance. "Those who are virtuous receive abundant assistance." As long as China does not change its path, it will certainly receive abundant assistance. Therefore, even if China is now considered to be gradually entering a favorable environment, how to maintain this favorable environment still depends on making good use of the current foundation, maintaining greater determination, and cultivating greater strength.

### Anglo-Japanese Differences Lead to Stalemate in Negotiations; Japanese Military Insists on Implementing Economic Demands; British Government Urges Removal of Tianjin Blockade

(London) According to a diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Mail, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie is seeking instructions from London regarding the differences of opinion in the Tokyo talks regarding the prohibition of Chinese legal tender and the transfer of silver reserves in the British concession in Tianjin. The British side believes that legal tender is the recognized currency of the Chinese government and that Britain cannot prohibit its use, while the Japanese side claims that the circulation of legal tender hinders the establishment of the banknotes it wants to use. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)

(London) According to today's inquiries, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, apparently encouraged by the United States' termination of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, has instructed the British Ambassador in Tokyo to urge the Japanese side to remove the blockade of Tianjin as soon as possible. If the Japanese side continues to blockade Tianjin, it will affect subsequent negotiations in Tokyo. (Associated Press dispatch from the 29th)

(London) According to sources here, the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo have reached a stalemate. British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie is currently seeking new instructions from London regarding the Tianjin concession currency issue. (Huitong News dispatch from the 29th)

(Tokyo) According to a Japanese newspaper, the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference is on the verge of collapse because the representatives of both sides still have widely divergent opinions on the issues of legal tender and silver reserves. Last night, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army gathered to discuss this matter and were reported to have decided to maintain the Japanese viewpoint. According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, the Japanese army holds the view that if the British side continues to maintain its dishonest attitude, the conference will inevitably collapse completely. It is reported that the British representative believes that the abandonment or preservation of silver owned by the Chinese National Bank is purely a matter for the Chinese banks to decide, and that the storage of silver in the British concession is accidental and an economic matter, so the Craigie-Arita agreement cannot be applied. However, the Japanese side insists that the resolution of economic issues is necessary to maintain peace and order in Tianjin. Therefore, the British side, based on the Craigie-Arita agreement, must accept the Japanese demands. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)

(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese Tokyo Conference held negotiations on the Tianjin security issue, proceeded smoothly, and achieved satisfactory results. However, when discussing economic issues such as the prohibition of legal tender circulation and the transfer of silver, the opinions of the two sides suddenly diverged, making the future completely unpredictable. According to the British claim, economic issues are related to the national policy of the country and are completely different in nature from the issue of security. Therefore, the general principle of understanding reached between Arita and Craigie should not include economic issues. However, the Japanese military authorities are extremely concerned about economic issues and believe that this issue is the central and important part of the current meeting. The prohibition of legal tender circulation and the transfer of silver reserves are fundamental factors in the Chinese security issue. Therefore, the security issue cannot be resolved without resolving the economic issue. The Japanese side must resolve these two issues together and absolutely opposes resolving them separately. The Tianjin case negotiations may therefore result in a complete breakdown. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 29th)

(Tokyo) Regarding the main unresolved parts of the Anglo-Japanese conference, the removal of anti-Japanese Chinese employees from the Public Works Bureau, the prohibition of the use of legal tender within the concession, and the handover of Chinese silver reserves are currently in a standoff and will be resolved at the sixth conference on the 31st. However, to facilitate the conference, representatives of the two countries held separate meetings on the morning of the 29th in an attempt to break the deadlock. For example, Major General Muto, the local army representative of the Japanese side, visited British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie and Consul General Butler at the British Embassy at 10:00 a.m. that day for a one-and-a-half-hour cordial discussion. Consul Tanaka, Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka, and Major Ota also consulted at the residence of a Foreign Ministry official on the same day regarding the attitude to be taken. In addition, Consul Butler made a private visit to the residence of a Foreign Ministry official at 11:00 a.m. Furthermore, Minister Kato and Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie also held close talks at the Tokyo Club at 10:40 a.m. From this observation, it can be seen that the representatives of the two countries are communicating frequently, and it is expected that there will be considerable progress in the sixth Anglo-Japanese conference on the 31st. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 29th)

(London) Regarding the report submitted to the government by Sir Robert Craigie on the situation of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, the Foreign Office will study it at the end of the week and send a new instruction by telegram to Sir Robert Craigie before Monday next week as a guideline for continuing the negotiations. (Huitong News dispatch from the 29th)

(Tokyo) Regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, after British representative Sir Robert Craigie refused to accept the Japanese demands to prohibit the use of legal tender and hand over silver reserves in the British concession in Tianjin, newspapers here sharply criticized him this morning. Japanese military officials believe that if the United Kingdom does not change this stubborn attitude, Anglo-Japanese negotiations will inevitably come to a complete standstill. Japanese political figures stated that the economic requirements put forward by Japan are the basic and preliminary conditions for maintaining order in East Asia and that the United Kingdom must accept them, otherwise it will violate the spirit of the Craigie-Arita preliminary agreement. (Huitong News dispatch from the 29th)

### Economic Issues Submitted to Subcommittee for Discussion

(Tokyo) Various circles in Japan believe that although the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin issue are not proceeding smoothly, they are still in good order. The representatives of both sides will talk separately today. As a result, it was decided to submit the economic issues to a committee, which is scheduled to meet at 9:00 a.m. on Monday. British Commercial Counselor Macleay and Tianjin Consul Herbert will be the British representatives to this committee, while the Japanese representatives will be Tianjin Consul General Tanaka, and Foreign Ministry Secretaries Aoki and Asaka. According to Japanese sources, the Tianjin Anti-British Citizens Association is becoming impatient with the slow progress of the Tokyo negotiations and has decided to convene an anti-British conference at noon on Monday at two locations in Tianjin, planning to march through the streets and gather around the British consulate. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)

(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of prohibiting the circulation of legal tender and the issue of the transfer of silver reserves, which have become obstacles to the Anglo-Japanese conference, Minister Kato and British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie agreed on the 29th that the two sides would select a small committee of experts familiar with the local situation to conduct basic discussions to adapt to the actual situation, so as to obtain a satisfactory compromise. The Japanese side has decided that Consul Tanaka Hikozou, Asami Kouichirou, and Aoki Morio, two Foreign Ministry officials, will be appointed to the committee, while the British side will be represented by Consul Herbert and Commercial Counselor Macleay. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 29th)

### Britain Has No Right to Unilaterally Resolve the Two Demands

(London) Regarding the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Japan in Tokyo, Japan raised two demands: first, the silver of Chinese banks deposited in foreign banks in Tianjin should be handed over to Japan; second, the circulation of Chinese legal tender should be prohibited in the British concession in Tianjin. The United Kingdom and Japan therefore have diverging opinions. Informed sources here recently explained Britain's position on this matter, saying that Britain acknowledges that it has no right to resolve these two demands unilaterally. As for the first item, French banks also hold silver from Chinese banks, and Britain cannot make any decision before exchanging views with the French government. As for the second item, since the United Kingdom and France have a relationship with it, other countries that maintain interests in China are also concerned. The British government cannot unilaterally deal with it. It seems that a new instruction will be sent by telegram to British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie in accordance with this viewpoint. In this way, it is already clear that the British government does not want to thoroughly discuss the two demands made by Japan, nor does it want to involve issues related to general policies, and even less does it want to make any unilateral solutions. (Havas dispatch from the 29th)

### Various Circles in China Advise Britain to Stop Negotiations

(Chongqing) Since Britain announced the contents of the Craigie-Arita Agreement on the 25th, Chinese people have been extremely concerned. Judging from Britain's attitude towards the Far East in the past, it cannot be regarded as a failure. Although Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax have repeatedly stated in Parliament that Britain's policy towards China has not changed, there are still many worries about the trend of negotiations in Tokyo. Moreover, the Japanese are actively inciting anti-British actions while claiming that the negotiations are proceeding smoothly. In this situation, it can be seen that Japan has no sincerity towards Britain. Therefore, according to experts, Britain hopes to obtain Japan's understanding in the Tokyo negotiations in order to prevent its interests in China from being further damaged, which is tantamount to quenching thirst with plums. Moreover, Japan's fundamental policy towards Britain is to gradually undermine its position in the Far East, with no room for compromise with Britain. If Britain continues to negotiate, Japan will never be satisfied unless Britain succumbs and surrenders. It is reported that various circles in China are currently discussing ways to advise Britain to immediately stop the Tokyo negotiations and not compromise with Japan, to take parallel action with the United States, and to resolutely implement decisive measures against Japan to promote its awakening. This movement is currently being discussed by all parties and deserves special attention. (Dispatch from the 29th)

(Chongqing) People here are quite pleased to hear the news that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo have diverged on the monetary system issue. Various Chinese organizations have now begun a movement to persuade Britain to stop the Tokyo negotiations, saying that such negotiations are not only useless but also damage British interests and prestige in the Far East. The Chinese believe that since differences of opinion have arisen on the monetary system issue, there is hope that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations will be suspended. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)

(Chongqing) This morning, the Chongqing Lianhe Ribao published an editorial urging Britain to immediately suspend the Tokyo negotiations, saying that attempts to resolve disputes with Japan through negotiations are doomed to failure. If reasonable discussions and diplomatic negotiations could resolve disputes with Japan, why would the war against China have occurred, and the conferences of the League of Nations and at the Hague should have resolved them long ago. The suspicions of the people of Britain, the Commonwealth, the British people, and British friends regarding Britain's lack of resolve after the Munich Conference are now deepened by the announcement of the Anglo-Japanese compromise. This greatly damages Britain's prestige among the countries of the world. (Reuters dispatch from the 29th)

### While Tokyo Negotiations Proceed, Britain Temporarily Refrains from Proposing Treaty Abolition, Still Cooperating Closely with the United States, Determined to Uphold Interests in China

(London) Last night, authorities explained Britain's Far East policy to reporters, indicating that while negotiations are underway in Tokyo, Britain will avoid abolishing the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. However, after the Tokyo negotiations, should they fail, the British government will follow the United States in abolishing the treaty. It is said that the US action has prompted Britain to consider similar retaliatory action, but Britain is unwilling to disrupt the success of the Tokyo negotiations. Although the US move was sudden and not consulted with Britain beforehand, the two countries are still cooperating closely in the Far East. Labour Party member Mr. Baker will request Mr. Chamberlain to explain the US action at the House of Commons meeting next Monday, and also ask Mr. Chamberlain to clearly answer whether Japan has requested Britain to stop supporting Chinese legal tender. (July 29, Associated Press)

(London) After the US government officially announced the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, individuals close to the government here openly stated that the 1911 Anglo-Japanese treaty may also be declared abolished. It was said that although Britain is willing to reach a compromise with Japan, it is determined to uphold its interests in China and cannot tolerate the increasingly expanding anti-British movement. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, raised this issue with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on July 21. Subsequently, the British government repeatedly protested to the Japanese government regarding the anti-British movement and the attitude of the Japanese military authorities in North China, hoping that the Japanese government and military authorities would exercise restraint; otherwise, Britain may retaliate by declaring the abolition of the treaty. In short, Japan's true intentions can be discerned when the economic issues, especially the issue of silver deposits in Tianjin, are submitted for discussion. (July 29, Havas)

### Japanese Navy Intensifies Blockade of South China Coast

(Hong Kong) According to an official gazette published by the Hong Kong government, the Japanese Navy is gradually intensifying the blockade of the Chinese coast in South China, and is laying mines outside the ports of Swabue, Yulin Bay, Qiongzhou, Tongshan, Jianfeng, Shaha, Sanduao, and Wenzhou.

### The United States Pursues an Independent Policy in the Far East, Maintaining a Watchful Attitude Towards the Situation in China, Treaty Abolition Issue Not Consulted with Britain and France in Advance

(Washington) When Secretary of State Hull met with the press today, reporters raised numerous questions about US-Japan relations. Secretary of State Hull remained extremely reserved and refused to comment on the repeated statements made by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman. US political figures said that this statement was not worth taking seriously. The State Department remained unmoved by the last statement, which stated that the Japanese government did not intend to force the United States to recognize the new situation in China before a new US-Japan treaty was concluded, and maintained a silent attitude. Observers believe that the US attitude towards Japan and what actions the US will take in the Far East depend on (1) how American public opinion reacts and (2) how the evolution of the Far East situation affects purely American interests. Furthermore, Secretary of State Hull confirmed to reporters that the US government authorities did not discuss the announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with the British and French ambassadors, indicating that the United States wants to pursue an independent and autonomous policy in the Far East, and make decisions purely based on how the situation in the Far East affects American interests. In terms of public opinion, whenever the government adopts a method of international cooperation, suspicion is always shown, and now it is easier to support an independent policy. (July 28, Havas)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull declared last night that the US government has exchanged views with Britain and France regarding the Far East issue. Hull also stated that the US government did not consult with Britain and France before abolishing the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. This decision by the democratic countries to exchange views on the Far East issue is merely a general matter. (July 29, Associated Press)

(Washington) President Roosevelt did not comment on the US abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in his conversation with reporters yesterday. (July 29, Associated Press)

### Japanese Government Considers Diplomatic Policy, Takes a Wait-and-See Attitude Towards the United States, No Intention to Lodge Protest

(Tokyo) According to a statement issued by semi-official sources, the inner cabinet meeting composed of Prime Minister Hiranuma, Army Minister Itagaki, Navy Minister Yonai, and Finance Minister Ishiwata will be held recently to discuss diplomatic policy in order to adapt to the principles determined by the Japanese government on June 5 regarding the European situation. According to the minutes of the cabinet meeting on June 5, Hiranuma met with the Emperor and presented the "Basic Plan for Japan's Policy on the European Situation." When Soviet Russia bombed the South Manchurian Railway, Army Minister Itagaki requested on July 18 that an inner cabinet meeting be convened immediately, saying that the Soviet bombing was clearly related to the European situation, and that Japan needed to take "appropriate measures." Political figures believe that the meeting will have a detailed discussion on this issue. (July 29, Haitong)

(Tokyo) After the United States announced the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Japanese political and financial figures have remained silent and have not expressed any opinions on the outcome of this move, but their dissatisfaction can be glimpsed from the phrase "sudden and regrettable American step." When the Japanese cabinet met yesterday, it seemed to have decided not to lodge a protest with Washington, but to wait and see the background of this move and make a decision after observing clearly. (July 29, Haitong)

(Tokyo) Since the United States suddenly abolished the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the Japanese public has been extremely shocked, because in the past two years, the Tokyo government has deliberately kept the news of the repeated US protests secret, and the general public originally thought that US-Japan relations were as good as ever. Viscount Okabe, a member of the House of Peers, said, "The US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has been signed and implemented for more than 25 years. We are shocked to hear the news that the US has suddenly announced its abolition." Okabe also speculated that the authorities in London and Washington "must have some kind of understanding." Okabe was working at the Japanese Embassy in the United States when the US and Japan signed the treaty in 1911. (July 29, Associated Press)

### US Treaty Abolition Suits the Timing, Ambassador Koo Speaks

(Paris) Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Wellington Koo stated that the US government's abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was a timely and encouraging action, saying that the US note to Japan showed that the US could not condone the repeated violations of treaty rights and the humiliation suffered by the American people without seeking a way to resist. This is a statesmanlike step. The abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has a far-reaching force to promote the happiness of the world. The Chinese people are now greatly excited to see that the principles they are fighting to uphold are now also supported by other countries and know that their efforts to seek a more orderly world are not isolated and helpless. (July 29, Reuters)

### European Newspaper Observations on the Impact of US Treaty Abolition, British Attitude Strengthened as a Result, Germany and Italy Feel Significant Stimulus

(London) The morning newspapers here have continued to comment on the US government's abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The diplomatic correspondent of the London Times declared, "The move by the United States is largely sufficient to show that the policies pursued by Britain and the United States on the Far East issue, although they may not want to be mutually binding, have parallel interests. As for the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, while the Tianjin issue is being negotiated in Tokyo, there is no time to consider the issue of abolition, but when the British authorities reconsider the Far East issue, if they find it necessary to take the same actions as the United States, this is not entirely impossible. The general public here does not shy away from saying it." The Daily Express reported, "This move by the US government is welcomed by the entire public opinion here, and Britain is also considering taking similar actions." The Daily Telegraph reported, "According to news received here last night, the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo have been disrupted by the issue of prohibiting the circulation of Chinese legal tender in the Tianjin concessions and the disposal of all silver deposits in Chinese banks in the concessions. British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie has asked the government authorities for instructions. Regarding the issue of legal tender, the British side believes that the legal tender currently circulating in the two Tianjin concessions is recognized by the Chinese government, and the Chinese government is the legitimate government recognized by Britain. The Japanese side said that it intends to replace the legal tender with banknotes issued by the 'North China United Reserve Bank.' The current attitude of Britain is sufficient to hinder it. As for the US treaty abolition, it is welcomed by the British government. The policies pursued by the governments of Britain and the United States on the Far East issue are largely parallel, and here is another proof of this. For example, whether the current Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Britain and Japan should be abolished, as the US government has done, Britain has repeatedly considered it in recent months. As of today, although there is no symbol of taking this kind of action, if the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo cannot proceed smoothly, the British government may have to notify Japan that Britain has various methods of pressure that can be used." The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, stated, "The talks between Britain and Japan in Tokyo will inevitably cause difficulties as soon as Japan puts forward its main demands. It is to be expected by the general public, but the original position of Britain has been greatly strengthened by the US President Roosevelt's treaty abolition, which is also undeniable."

Partial Change in the Far Eastern Balance of Power

(Paris) The morning newspapers here have continued to comment on the US government's abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The right-wing L'Ordre reported, "President Roosevelt's move may partially change the balance of power among the powers in the Far East. As for the overall event, there is a special point to note, that is, the United States has adopted a detached attitude towards Japan's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin. It is said that the British government has sounded out the United States, preparing to take a tough stance, but has not received encouragement. At this moment, since the United States has taken action, the basis of the Anglo-Japanese alliance (July 21) will be changed as a result, and the tone of British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, will also be stronger." L'Ère Nouvelle reported, "German Chancellor Hitler's sudden return to Berlin may be related to the US treaty abolition. Some foreign observers firmly believe that this move by the United States, in the eyes of those around Chancellor Hitler, will have a huge impact on the Berlin-Rome Axis. Chancellor Hitler himself clearly believes that if a war breaks out in Europe, the United States will take action in the Far East, and Germany's ally, Japan, has been greatly weakened and is unable to cope with the United States and the Soviet Union at the same time." (July 29, Havas)

(Paris) French newspapers attach great importance to the US abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Le Temps said that Washington is now launching a diplomatic offensive against Japanese imperialism, and what it is adopting is a radical plan to touch the weakest point of the Eastern empire. Some believe that the United States wants to make a powerful gesture to restore the situation in the minds of the people in the East, which has changed due to Britain's willingness to show weakness, which is noteworthy. American public opinion is now unanimously supporting the policies of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. (July 29, Reuters)

The United States Shows the Spirit of Sanctions

(Rome) Italian journalist Guido Gaita (known as a spokesman for Prime Minister Mussolini) recently published an article in "Il Giornale d'Italia" criticizing the US government's announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, calling it "President Roosevelt's rash action" and "the manifestation of the spirit of sanctions." He said, "President Roosevelt is implementing an oligarchy by dictatorial means, and he should be fully responsible for this treaty abolition. Generally speaking, the United States had agreed with the British government before deciding to take this action. When President Roosevelt suddenly took an anti-Japanese attitude for personal political reasons, Britain was outwardly yielding to the Japanese government and secretly promoting the same policy. The collusion between Britain and the United States can be seen from this. In Japan, it is well known that Britain's policy towards China has never changed, so there are sufficient reasons to consider the situation before and after and not to lift the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin for the time being."

On the US Abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation

### International Relations Expert Zhang Zhongfu Expresses Opinions, Although the Treaty Abolition Will Not Take Effect Until Six Months Later, Congress Can Immediately Prohibit Arms Shipments to Japan

(Chongqing) The US government's sudden announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has shocked the world. In order to understand the trend of the US abolition of the treaty and its future role, a reporter visited international relations expert Dr. Zhang Zhongfu, who provided a detailed analysis and expressed his opinions as follows: The US government notified Japan on July 26 of the abolition of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation concluded by the US and Japan in 1911. This move should be welcomed by the governments and peoples of peace-loving countries. Japan's aggression in China in recent years not only threatens China's survival, but also endangers the rights and interests of friendly countries in China and their positions in the Pacific. The implementation of Japan's continental policy must exclude the rights and interests of European and American countries in China, and Japan's ambition is not limited to conquering China. If Japan can conquer China, it will then use China's human and material resources to achieve the illusion of dominating the Pacific and conquering the world. People with insight in countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are very aware of Japan's ambition. However, countries such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are inevitably somewhat constrained in the Far East due to the thorny European issue. At present, the only country that is not subject to any constraints internationally is the United States. For the sake of the United States itself, the dignity of the treaty, and world peace, the United States has the necessity to implement economic sanctions against Japan. Once the United States stops supplying Japan with military supplies and raw materials, and stops importing Japanese goods, Japan's war of aggression will not be able to continue. Mr. Pittman and other US congressmen have proposed resolutions to ban exports to Japan. Mr. Vandenberg has expressed his desire to abolish the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in the Congress. (Note: Vandenberg is a Republican candidate for the next presidential election.) The abolition of the treaty is the power of the executive branch. President Roosevelt, seeing that American public opinion is unanimous and that legislators are advocating sanctions against Japan, resolutely abolished the US-Japan treaty. Japan's aggressive actions in the Far East in recent years have long violated the text and spirit of the treaties signed by the two countries. The US government can disregard whether the ban on exports to Japan conflicts with the 1911 treaty and implement retaliation or sanctions against Japan. However, once this treaty is abolished, the US will have no legal basis to criticize any retaliatory or sanctioning measures taken against Japan in the future. Although the treaty abolition will not take effect until six months later, Mr. Pittman's resolution to ban exports to Japan does not need to wait until six months later to be passed, because the resolution only authorizes the president to implement the embargo on countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty, and does not specify the date of implementation. In fact, the power of the US Congress is extremely large. Even if the US-Japan treaty has not been abolished, the US Congress can ban the export of military supplies such as scrap iron, coal, and oil to Japan for reasons of national defense. Congress can also follow the precedent of the Johnson Act and pass a bill based on the reason that Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty to ban the export of all goods. Congress can also prohibit the borrowing of US funds to Japan (ordinary loans and credit loans) in accordance with the Johnson Act because Japan has violated the treaty signed with the United States. Before Congress has a resolution, the US president also has the power to take measures that are more forceful than this statement, except for war. In fact, the United States has adopted such measures to protect its trade interests. According to Section 303 of the US Tariff Act of 1930, the US president has the power to increase the corresponding import tax on the goods of any country, especially those that subsidize goods sold to the United States. President Roosevelt's previous method of increasing import taxes on German imports was based on this power. Section 309 of the same law stipulates that the president has the right to prohibit the import of all goods made by forced labor or prisoner labor. Section 337 of the same law stipulates that the US president may not allow the import of goods from countries that adopt special unfair trade practices. In 1934, the US tariff law stipulated that if any country discriminates against the export goods, the US president should refuse to grant it most-favored-nation treatment. This regulation has been implemented against Germany. If the country continues to discriminate against US export goods, the US president has the right to increase tariffs or even ban imports on goods imported into the US from that country under Section 338 of the 1930 Tariff Act. In addition, the US president can also use the silver purchase law to help friendly countries with balancing funds and punish countries that threaten US security and interests. The US president can also provide loans (ordinary loans and credit loans) to countries that have been invaded through the Export-Import Bank. In summary, although the abolition of the US-Japan treaty will not take effect until six months later, the US Congress has good reasons to ban the export of military supplies to Japan and does not have to wait until six months later. Although the US president has no right to ban exports to Japan, the US president still has the right to adopt a method of persuasion, such as the previous method of persuading US businessmen not to sell aircraft to Japan. As for raising import taxes on Japanese goods, or banning the import of Japanese goods, or lending money to China, or using balancing funds, and buying laws to help China, the US president now has this power. Some people (probably some isolationists in the United States) believe that once the above-mentioned measures are implemented, Japan will take retaliatory measures, and mutual retaliation will make war between the US and Japan inevitable. This statement seems to be true but is not. Many of the existing US laws discriminate against other countries for some special reasons, such as the Johnson Act and most-favored-nation treatment, etc., but no war has occurred with other countries because of this. Moreover, Japan's strength has been more than half depleted due to the war against China. Japan will not dare to go to war with the United States at this time. As for empty threats, they are the usual tricks of fascist countries and are not worth fearing. In addition, the US government's announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan treaty is the first step in proving the US government's determination to sanction aggressors, and it also proves the progress of American public opinion. Economic retaliation and economic sanctions by the United States against Japan will eventually be implemented, and the time is not far away, because although the 1911 US-Japan treaty stipulates that "there shall be no discrimination in trade," in fact, Japan not only subsidizes its goods sold to the United States, but also often discriminates against US export goods through special unfair trade practices. In addition, Japanese labor is extremely cheap, which is tantamount to forced labor or prisoner labor, so according to the tariff laws of 1930 and 1934, the US president now has the power to raise import taxes on Japanese goods or even ban their import.

### US Newspapers Advocate Anglo-American Naval Blockade of Japan, Predict US Will Ban Export of Munitions and Raw Materials to Japan

(New York) The New York Daily News commented yesterday that in order to deal with Japan's continued violation of the rights of third countries in China, Britain and the United States must take joint naval blockade against Japan as retaliation. The newspaper continued that the US government's abolition of the US-Japan treaty was purely for self-defense, and said that the United States will be the second target in Japan's policy of expelling foreigners' rights in China, so this move by the Americans is purely for self-defense. It is reported that the newspaper has the largest circulation in the United States, and the Philadelphia "Inquirer" predicts that the US government will soon ban the transportation of munitions and raw materials to Japan. The newspaper also praised President Roosevelt's "courageous" actions against Japan. The Boston "Globe" supported the US abolition of the US-Japan treaty, saying that in the situation where Japan is constantly destroying the lives and property of American citizens in China, there is no need to continue friendly relations with it. The St. Louis "Globe-Democrat" commented that the US government's abolition of the US-Japan treaty was a demonstration to Japan. The Kansas City "Star" said, "It will be very interesting to observe how Japan deals with it." The Los Angeles "Times" said that this move by the US government is not an "unfriendly" move towards Japan. The US government only means that the Japanese will no longer be able to continue their atrocities in the Far East. (July 29, Associated Press)

(New York) According to today's editorial in the New York World-Telegram, the future actions of the United States depend entirely on the actions of Japan. Economic sanctions, although a resolute action in the United States, are a serious blow to Japan. At the same time, the number of Americans who support economic sanctions now accounts for the majority. The World-Telegram said that if Japan is willing to appease the anger of the United States, it can only change its "new order in East Asia." The New York Herald Tribune, adopted by the Democratic Party, said that the United States definitely wants Japan to have a "sudden feeling." Only in this way can Japan feel that the intention of the United States is not only to revise the treaty, but also has another meaning. It also said that there is a long time between the US notice of treaty abolition and the time when it takes effect, so the Japanese military will definitely not sit idly by during this period. Therefore, without waiting to test whether it can take effect, the Japanese military will take retaliatory measures. (July 29, Associated Press)

### British Approved Credit Loans Totalling 60 Million Pounds Sterling, Including New Loans to China

(London) King George of England yesterday approved the Overseas Trade Guarantees Act, which authorizes the government to lend friendly countries credit loans up to £60,000,000. Britain has agreed to lend Poland £8,000,000 in this amount, and China hopes to obtain £3,000,000. (July 29, Associated Press)

### Repercussions of US Abrogation of the Japan-US Treaty, Signing of New German-Japanese Trade Agreement, Strengthening of Anti-Comintern Axis Ties, Germany's Move Intended to Reassure Japan

(Berlin) According to official announcements, the commercial agreement between Japan and Germany was signed this afternoon and will take effect on October 1 this year. The main points are to increase trade between Germany and Japan through a clearing system, and for Germany to provide credit to Japan. An official communique stated, "This agreement will further strengthen the commercial relationship between the two countries within the scope of current friendship." (Havas dispatch, 28th)

(Berlin) According to the new German-Japanese agreement signed yesterday, Japan will increase imports from Germany by 80 million Reichsmarks worth of goods, and Germany will also increase imports from Japan by 60 million Reichsmarks. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry recently stated that negotiations for the German-Japanese commercial agreement have been ongoing for nearly two years. It was now signed in Berlin. The Japanese representative was Oshima, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, and the German representative was Walter, a German economic expert. This agreement should increase the volume of German-Japanese trade and enhance economic ties between the two countries. Japan can obtain more supplies of various goods needed in peacetime or wartime, and Germany can purchase more Japanese seafood, agricultural products, and so on. As a result, economic relations within the anti-communist cooperation will become closer. It is gratifying that the Anti-Comintern Axis is gradually strengthening in economic and other aspects. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) The German-Japanese commercial agreement was signed and established here this afternoon. German political figures expressed extreme satisfaction and said that this was "a swift and sharp response to the United States' declaration of the abrogation of the Japan-US commercial treaty." With these improvements in German-Japanese commercial relations, the losses that Japan may suffer after the abrogation of the Japan-US commercial treaty can be fully compensated. Regarding the US abrogation of the treaty, it must have been done after obtaining the agreement of the UK. President Roosevelt likely wanted to retaliate because the amendment to the Neutrality Act had suffered a setback in Congress. (Havas, 28th)

(Berlin) According to authoritative sources, the German-Japanese commercial agreement has been under negotiation for a long time, and the timing of the signing is quite interesting. Political circles believe that this announcement actually acknowledges that the new German-Japanese agreement not only makes clear the strength and unity of the Axis powers to Britain and the world, but is also a counter-attack against the United States. The new German-Japanese agreement places economic relations between the two countries on a formal basis. Previously, economic relations between the two countries were based on "gentlemen's agreements." In the past few years, German-Japanese trade has brought Germany huge trade surpluses, and this trend continues to increase. This trend is partly due to Japan's import of large quantities of heavy industrial machinery and chemicals from Germany. On the other hand, Germany's trade with "Manchukuo" has had a large trade deficit in recent years. Although the terms of the German-Japanese agreement have not yet been announced, it has been learned that the Chinese market is still a place of free competition for both Germany and Japan. Well-informed sources claim that some clauses of the agreement regulate Japan's payment methods, which are of a technical nature, just like the payment methods stipulated between Germany and "Manchukuo." (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) The commercial agreement signed by Germany and Japan has just been commented on by various newspapers here, all saying that this is a direct response to the United States' abrogation of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Japan. The "Local Guidance Report" stated, "The United States government did not consider the consequences of this move, and it was instigated by the British government. However, Britain will soon realize that this kind of assistance from the United States is not enough to help it consolidate its position in the Far East. How it will turn out in reality will soon become clear. In other words, Britain and the United States have already created a situation that will allow the trade relations of the signatories of the Anti-Comintern Pact to develop healthily. As for the German-Japanese commercial agreement, it was signed only after thorough research. This agreement is a systematic structure, which is very different from the methods adopted by various democratic countries." The "German General News" stated, "Trade between Germany and Japan will definitely see great development. After the establishment of an agreement between Britain and Japan, negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have been intensified. This must be paid attention to. Japan now suspects that Britain and the United States are acting in concert, and it has also begun to doubt whether Britain is sincere in establishing an agreement." (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### Manchu Soybeans, Quantity Exported to Germany, Valued at 40 Million Marks in Six Months of This Year

Changchun. The German ambassador to "Manchukuo" announced that from January to June of this year, the total amount of soybeans imported by Germany from "Manchukuo" was 505,700 tons, with a total value of 47,475,000 marks. (Dohmei News Agency dispatch, 29th)

### German Head of State and Foreign Minister Return to the Capital to Confer on the Current Situation, Deliberately Displaying Leisurely Demeanor, Departed from Berlin Again on the Same Day

(Berlin) Head of State Hitler, who was originally in Bayreuth attending the Wagner music festival, suddenly returned to the capital yesterday at noon. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was originally escaping the heat in Bavaria, also returned here yesterday and went to the Chancellery to meet with Hitler and hold talks, discussing the recent international situation for a long time. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) Head of State Hitler left the capital again this morning, likely returning to Bayreuth. At the same time, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also went to Salzburg again. As for what the Head of State and Foreign Minister discussed, responsible parties are completely unaware. The fact that the Head of State did not attend the free telephone exhibition being held here indicates that his return to the capital was not for this purpose. It can be asserted that, in addition, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels is in Munich presiding over the opening ceremony of the television exhibition and attending equestrian competitions, and Air Force Minister Göring is inspecting various rivers and canals by yacht. Economic Minister Funk is also on vacation. All of this is clearly intended to show the greatness of Germany's power and that the government is leisurely and carefree. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

(Berlin) Head of State Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop suddenly returned to the capital this morning. It is expected that there will be a series of political activities here. Although the government claims that Head of State Hitler returned to the capital only to discuss various routine official duties with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, it is actually heard that it is related to the recent developments in the international situation. For example, the United States' declaration of the abrogation of the Japan-US commercial treaty, as well as the progress made in the negotiations between China, France, and the Soviet Union, have all made a deep impression on Germany. Regarding the former, Germany has swiftly signed a commercial agreement with Japan to show its reaction. The German authorities intend to prevent the people of the Anti-Comintern countries from feeling frustrated by this move by the United States, so they are eager to avoid it. In addition, the progress made in the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, with staff members of the three countries scheduled to begin talks within days, is also one of the reasons why Head of State Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returned to the capital. German officials originally thought that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union would continue to stall, but now they are greatly disappointed. In addition, the slow progress of the German-Soviet commercial and financial talks and the major difficulties encountered are enough to make the German authorities feel anxious. German newspapers recently ridiculed and mocked the efforts of Britain and France to approach the Soviet Union in every way, but this morning all the newspapers remained silent. They also did not publish a single word of the Soviet government's statement that the trilateral talks would continue. All of these phenomena have clues to be found in them. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### Anglo-Franco-Soviet Negotiations Practically Completed, Only Minor Issues Remaining to be Resolved, Military Talks to Begin Next Week

(Paris) It is heard that Foreign Minister Bonnet today, in the Cabinet meeting, explained the diplomatic situation in detail for a long time, and paid great attention to the negotiations currently underway between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is said that these negotiations, in terms of important points, can now be said to have been successfully completed. The only minor differences in opinion remaining concern the drafting of the "indirect aggression" clause. This is just a drafting issue and will not affect the entire negotiation. Military talks are expected to begin next week and will proceed in parallel with political talks. A British military delegation led by an air force general and a naval admiral will depart from London for Paris in the middle of next week and go to Moscow with the French military delegation led by General Doumenc. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)

(London) According to reliable sources, the staff talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will be held in Moscow within ten days. The form it will take has already been discussed yesterday by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Naggiar, and the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov. Once negotiations are resumed on the 30th of this month, a concrete decision can be made to enable Prime Minister Chamberlain to make a statement in the House of Commons on the 31st. However, the rumor that the British government will appoint General Chatwyn-White as the chief representative to participate in the staff talks is unlikely to be true. The government will generally select one of the naval admirals to serve as the representative. According to the current situation, the prospects for political negotiations are quite optimistic. The statement that Prime Minister Chamberlain should issue, as well as the government's dispatch of a military delegation to Moscow, can lead to the final decision on the Anglo-Franco-Soviet political agreement. Although the question of defining "indirect aggression" has not yet been resolved, the attitude of the Soviet Union is expected to become more moderate once staff talks begin. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### French General Election Postponed for Two Years, Government Promulgates Substitute Decrees

(Paris) The Cabinet held a state meeting today, presided over by President Lebrun, and immediately passed several substitute laws, including: (1) The term of office of each member of the current Chamber of Deputies should be extended from four years to six years, i.e., from June 1, 1940, to June 1, 1942; (2) Strengthen counter-espionage agencies and establish an intelligence agency to resist foreign propaganda movements. It is heard that diplomat and writer Giraudoux will be the director; (3) The weekly working hours of each administrative agency will be increased from 40 hours to 45 hours. (Havas dispatch, 29th)

### Roman Pope Dedicated to World Peace, Gasparri Ordered to Arrive in the US, Carrying Reply to Roosevelt

(New York) Cardinal Gasparri, a confidant of Pope Pius XII, who is on a tour of the United States and Canada, arrived here today aboard the Italian mail ship "Duke of Savoy." According to a recent report by the Rome correspondent of the London Times, President Roosevelt sent a letter to Pope Pius XII, putting forward some suggestions on maintaining peace. The Pope ordered Cardinal Gasparri to personally carry a reply and present it to President Roosevelt. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### Chinese Government Announces, Amount of Legal Tender Issued, Totals Over 260 Billion Yuan, Cash Reserves Still Higher Than Other Countries

(Chongqing) The Chinese government announced last night that the legal tender issued by the four major Chinese banks (Central, China, Communications, Agricultural Bank of China) totaled 2,626,929,300 yuan as of the end of June. The issuance of this legal tender is backed by gold, silver, and foreign exchange valued at 1,156,088,974.33 yuan, and government-issued or guaranteed public bonds or treasury bills valued at 1,470,840,325.67 yuan. In addition, assets and short-term commercial paper deemed acceptable by the Ministry of Finance are used as reserves for the issuance of legal tender. The announcement stated that the ratio of cash and marketable securities reserves is 44 percent and 56 percent, respectively. The Central Bank issued the largest amount of legal tender, accounting for 1,048,883,145 yuan, followed by the Bank of China, which issued 703,570,740 yuan. The Bank of Communications ranked third, issuing 548,456,070 yuan, and the Agricultural Bank of China ranked last, issuing 326,019,345 yuan. The announcement stated that before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, China's legal tender cash reserve was 60 percent, which has now been reduced to 44 percent. The announcement indicated that this ratio "is still higher than the cash reserves of most countries." The decrease in cash reserves is due to the increase in the amount of legal tender issued. Before the war, the amount of legal tender issued was 1,400,000,000 yuan. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

### Minister of Economic Affairs Wong Wen-hao Talks, China Striving to Adjust Trade, Increase Output of Tung Oil and Tin, Obtain Foreign Exchange to Repay Loans, Plan to Conclude Agreements with Foreign Countries, Aiming to Exchange Goods for Munitions

(Chongqing) According to Minister of Economic Affairs Wong Wen-hao, who spoke to an Associated Press reporter, China is now trying to increase exports and reduce imports of luxury goods in order to strengthen its war of resistance. China's current goals are (1) to increase the output of tin in order to obtain foreign exchange, (2) to conclude barter agreements with foreign countries in order to obtain munitions, and (3) to increase the output of tung oil in order to repay foreign loans and lending. Our soldiers are now serving the country on the front lines and behind the Japanese lines. We must work in the rear to maintain and strengthen our strength. However, the biggest difficulty at present is in the organization of transportation. The current import regulations do not hinder the industrial construction of western China. First, the machines transported from the coast to the interior are now fully utilized. Second, equipment and industrial supplies have not been prohibited from being imported so far. The import bans are mostly on luxury goods, etc. The general Chinese people believe that the implementation of this point is already a bit late. China must currently avoid the outflow of funds. What China needs a month ago is not to spend much money abroad. China cannot do without foreign aid, whether it is government or private loans, they are all needed. However, up to now, very little capital has been invested in the interior. In the view of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, investing in the interior is the best policy, because the prosperity of the coastal areas is dependent on the prosperity of the interior, and this point will become more obvious when the war ends. As for modern machinery, although it can transform the interior, it cannot be obtained without foreign investment. For example, Xikang, Sichuan, and Yunnan all have copper mines. After the establishment of the Dian-Chuan Highway, the transportation problem can be solved, but the machinery for extracting silver mines must be purchased from overseas. Speaking of the barter system, Wong believes that this system will harm the interests of many countries in the world, but in wartime economy, this measure is necessary. For example, barter agreements, such as the export of tung oil to the United States, have no difficulties, because the United States has become our main customer. As for the recent restrictions on exports, although they will reduce China's trade, this is inevitable due to the war. The most affected by China's import restrictions is France, because China's luxury goods mostly come from France, but we are determined to compensate France for this loss. For example, we plan to purchase the machinery needed by various factories in Yunnan from France. In order to increase transportation convenience, the French side has agreed to increase the transportation volume of the Vietnam Railway. Wong continued, the harvest this year is very good, so there is absolutely no problem with food for the people. Although prices in the interior are currently high, especially for cloth, prices are expected to fall after the establishment of small-scale factories. The formation of industrial cooperatives is not good now, but the future is unlimited. Also, although the amount of legal tender issued in China has doubled compared to before the war, it has little impact on living standards, except for a few imported goods. At the same time, various price stabilization agencies are now doing their best to suppress prices under the guidance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)

North China, Severe Flooding

### Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Far East Red Army Replaced, Names of 79 Military Officers Dismissed Due to Suspicion of Reactionary Activities

(Berlin) The Nazi Party newspaper "Völkischer Beobachter" recently reported that the Soviet government has appointed General Popov to replace General Stern as the Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Red Army. General Stern succeeded General Vasily Blyukher as the Commander of the Far Eastern Army in the late summer and early autumn of last year. It is heard that General Blyukher's censure was due to his advice. Now he is also uneasy in his position. In addition, 79 military and government officials have also been dismissed by the government, several of whom were under the command of General Blyukher, especially Deputy Commander of the Far East Red Army, General Lai Bing, and the Administrative Chief of the Ural Military District, Chevikov. Others, such as the Soviet representative to Outer Mongolia, Tairov, the leader of the Communist Youth League's Far East Branch, Ovchinikov, the former military attaché of the Embassy in the United States, Olas, and the political commissar of the Naval Academy, Rapoport, are also on the list of those dismissed this time. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

(Moscow) There is much speculation here about why General Stern, the commander of the 1st Special Red Banner Army stationed in the Far East, was unable to participate in person in the Naval Day parade held in Vladivostok. It is believed that General Stern may have been left in command of Soviet troops operating in Outer Mongolia. Commander Lisid served as General Stern's representative on Naval Day, but it is not known whether it is temporary or permanent. The authorities here also announced yesterday that the honorary medals of 79 officers have been stripped due to the discovery of reactionary suspicions, but there are no important government officials among them.

### Swatow and Other Places Bombed, Chinese Army Controls the Chao-Shan Coastal Line, Wu Qikwei's Troops Transferred to Dongjiang

Chao-Mei News, On July 20, the Japanese army attacked Shanwei, with more than a thousand casualties. The Chinese army besieged and entered Shanwei, and the Japanese army retreated to warships. Fifteen Japanese planes took turns dropping more than a hundred bombs on Shanwei city, and the nearby eighteen villages were also brutally bombed. No store in any of them was intact. After the Japanese army retreated in defeat, three planes were sent to bomb Huiyang city on the 21st. The Aotou Market in Daya Bay was bombed again on the morning of the 22nd, with more than sixty bombs dropped. On the same day, at 8:30 a.m., four Japanese planes flew into Aotou, Ping Shan, Danshui, Shenzhen, Changping from Humen.

Dropping bombs everywhere. At nine o'clock, another seven planes flew in, dropping bombs like rain in the sky. More than 150 people were bombed to death in the market, and men and women from the entire market scattered and fled. Japanese planes opened fire and strafed. Chijiao, only half a mile from Hong Kong, was hit by two huge bombs. People were sent to investigate the disaster. According to reports, only ruins and dilapidated buildings remain in the 200 shops on Chijiao Fishing Street, none of which are intact. Aotou is the same as Shanwei. The most famous Qingtian Hotel, Taoran and Maoran inns, and the two major tea houses, Tianran, Meilong, and Yuanfeng, and other major foreign goods companies, are all in the rubble. The bombing situation on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is also very tragic. The railway line from Shenzhen to Pinghu, Changping, and Zhangmutou is still preserved, and handcars are used for transportation. On the 21st and 22nd, three Japanese planes formed a team,

Scouting along the line, shooting at transport workers, and dropping bombs on places where goods were stockpiled at stations. Sometimes they flew into New Street in Hong Kong, on Daoling Mountain. On the morning of the 23rd, at about 4:00, Japanese planes appeared over Shenzhen. At 8:30 a.m., Japanese planes flew from Taiping, Dongguan, and circled over Baonan Nantou before heading towards Shenzhen and dropping bombs on the Shiji Pinghu section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The transport workers quickly fled into the bamboo forest opposite Pinghu Station to hide. Japanese planes dropped a bomb on the bamboo forest, killing 23 people and injuring 11 people on the spot, with blood and flesh flying everywhere. The Shenzhen rescue team rushed to the scene to rescue the wounded, collect the bodies, and bury them. At 1:00 p.m., another Japanese plane flew from Guangzhou into Shenzhen and dropped six bombs on Shiji and two bombs on Hengli, causing considerable casualties. Wu Qikwei's elite troops have already

Transferred to the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River. On the 21st, Chih Chung-kwan, the Commissioner of the Fourth District, convened a meeting of the responsible officials from Huiyang, Haifeng, and Lufeng to discuss and decide to assist the regular army in combat, to harvest the abundant mountain rice crops early, and to transport them into the mountains for storage. In the Chao-Shan area, fierce battles have been raging for days. Inside and outside the Chaoan City Temple, the two armies have been charging back and forth. The Japanese army is guarding Jinshan, Hulu Mountain, and Zhugao Mountain. On the morning of the 20th, the Chinese army advanced south along the railway and attacked Anbu. The Japanese army retreated into Malong, where it was defeated by the Chinese ambush and retreated to Swatow. Currently, the entire Chao-Shan Railway line, from Anbu to Fengxi, is under the control of the Chinese army and civilians.

### In Memory of a True Friend of China

— Dr. Henninghaus   Zhao Erqian

Dr. Henninghaus (Dr. Henninghaus) passed away on the 20th of this month in Qingzhou, Shandong. Western newspapers in this city, such as the North China Daily News on the 25th, the French Shanghai Daily on the 26th, and the German Far Eastern Times on the 23rd, all published obituaries, praising his noble character and contributions to this country. In addition to the praise, there was a deep sense of sorrow. At this time of national effort to build and revitalize the country, what is needed is a spirit of hard work, perseverance, and dedication until death to serve the world. Unexpectedly, this old man has passed away, leaving us behind. Recalling the past and thinking about the future, I write this short essay in the middle of summer to commemorate this foreigner who truly loved China.

I remember it was the summer of 1930 when I was studying at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. I often mingled with a group of international students, among whom a German classmate was the most familiar. This was because it was a small international league, with people from all countries, but without international boundaries or wars. At a tea party discussion, young Fritz, who had just returned from Germany, took out a clean white business card and gave it to me. It read "Henninghaus, Qingzhou Prefecture, Shandong." On the back were the words "Sincerely wish to visit, for this purpose only." Seeing my surprised expression, Fritz kindly said to me, "During my travels in southern Germany this summer, I met this old man. He is the bishop of Qingzhou Prefecture in China, who has lived in China for a long time and loves China deeply. When he heard me say that there were Chinese students in the distance, he asked me to bring the card to pay his respects because he had to rush back to China, otherwise, he would have come to visit." I casually treasured the card. Subconsciously, my attitude was that since he was "just speaking idly, I would just listen idly." After all, I was an unknown person, and there was no need for a great man to "sincerely" "visit." I thought Fritz was playing another trick, getting a business card from somewhere to fool around. Unexpectedly, four years later, I was working in the same educational institution as Dr. Henninghaus. Isn't this what Mr. Feng Zikai, the master of the Yuanyuantang, called "fate"?

Dr. Henninghaus's central undertakings in China mainly involved two aspects: education and religion. The core of his educational work was Fu Jen Catholic University in Beiping. The ultimate goal of his religious work was to cultivate a local Chinese clergy and establish a local church. These can be discussed separately:

Bishop Henninghaus's emphasis on education for both men and women, with the widespread establishment of schools at all levels within the Shandong diocese, is beyond description. What I want to talk about here is his relationship with Fu Jen Catholic University and his views and plans for higher education. He was one of the key bishops of the Society of the Divine Word, and served as a director of Fu Jen Catholic University alongside Hu Shi, Zhang Ji, Ma Xiangbo, and Weng Wenhao. He had great foresight and planning for the university's affairs. The development of Fu Jen in the past two years is particularly noteworthy. Historians are serious and accurate. In the section on the essential points of Fu Jen's affairs, there is the following record: "This university was founded by the Roman Catholic Church, initially entrusted to the American Benedictine Order. In 1925, Fu Jen Society was established, which was later expanded into Fu Jen Catholic University. In 1933, it was transferred to the Society of the Divine Word. The main points of expansion in the years 1937 and 1938 are listed below: 1. Establishment of graduate schools in arts and sciences. In order to meet the demand of university graduates for advanced knowledge, the university planned to establish graduate schools in arts and sciences. Preparations were completed in the spring of 1937, and the application was submitted to the Ministry for record. In June of the same year, approval was granted. The graduate school of history was established in the Faculty of Arts in 1937, and the graduate school of physics was added to the Faculty of Science in 1938. There were a total of 22 graduate students. 2. Adding female students. In March 1937, the university purchased the old Prince Gong Mansion for 199,000 national currency. The problem of the school building, which had existed for more than ten years, was temporarily solved. In September 1938, female students were added to the first year classes of the departments of arts, education, and mathematics and physics in the Faculty of Science. The eastern part of the mansion was allocated as a dormitory for the female students, managed by the Sisters of the Holy Spirit."

The above figures illustrate the countless material resources, talent, energy, and sacrifices invested in this university. At the same time, it also shows that success is not easy and starting a business is difficult. The entire university has grown up in hardship and struggle. Every expansion has been encouraged and promoted by Director Han, and his material and moral support is especially valuable. Therefore, can it not be said that Fu Jen's success today is due to the leadership of Han? General Foch made the following amazing argument after the end of the European War, which is worthy of reference for those engaged in education. He said: "In the past, my motto was knowledge first, conscience second. This sentence is still useful now, but I prefer to say: conscience first, knowledge second. Yes, conscience first, this is the most important thing." I believe that Henninghaus and Foch have the same feeling. He built the foundation of university education on conscience and morality, believing that education is parallel. Intellectual training is certainly important, but isn't moral education, which enables every intelligent animal to develop a perfect and noble personality, even more important? Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Fu Jen has remained a unique institution, standing firm amidst the stormy waves, and is regarded as a "surviving treasure," along with Yenching University. There are certainly many reasons for this, but its educational foundation is moral, which is of course one of the most sufficient explanations. In today's situation where universities are turned into barracks and auditoriums are used as stables, in the midst of the stormy weather, we can still hear the sound of singing. Thousands of students are fortunately safe. This is truly extraordinary. Remembering the predecessors, starting a business is difficult. Thinking about the past and the present, I can't help but shed tears.

In 1926, Pope Pius XI personally consecrated six Chinese bishops in Rome, changing the world's perception. Those who doubted the possibility of the existence of a local church and a local clergy no longer had any doubts. The purpose of missionaries is not to preach forever, but to cultivate a local clergy, so that the local church can be established in the local area, be deeply rooted, stable and unshakable, self-sufficient, and become an independent diocese, no longer requiring foreign aid. Now let us explore the achievements of Bishop Han's missionary work, and we can see that he has put the Pope's will into practice word by word. At present, there are more than 166,000 Catholics in the Qingzhou diocese, and more than 74,000 people who are seeking the faith. Bishop Han himself has consecrated more than 40 Chinese priests. Recently, part of the diocese has been divided to form a local Chinese diocese, which is presided over by Bishop Tian and Chinese priests. All these measures have been deeply appreciated by the Holy See in Rome. In 1932, on the occasion of Bishop Han's Golden Jubilee, he was appointed as a Papal Chamberlain Bishop. Since then, Han has become one of the key members of the Holy See. This kind of honorable promotion is truly a rare exception in the Catholic Church. At the same time, the University of Münster in Germany awarded Han an honorary doctorate in theology for his contributions to church affairs and writings. Since then, many people have called him Dr. Han. (To be continued)

### Someone Suggests the Shanghai Municipal Council Issue a New Shanghai Currency Based on British Gold. Most Opinions Consider It Very Difficult. Chinese People All Support the Legal Tender.

The "North-China Daily News" reports that a proposal to issue a Shanghai currency worth eight pence by the Shanghai Municipal Council has sparked heated discussions. Some approve, some oppose. The reporter recently investigated the shipping, commercial and banking sectors in Shanghai. Most of those questioned support the action, but opinions on the exact implementation of the plan vary greatly.

Convene Experts for Discussion

The reporter yesterday (28th) questioned the manager of a major import and export company in Shanghai, who said that this was a great idea. He was very happy to see the implementation of the plan, but he was afraid that in terms of expertise, the new currency could not be issued. The meaning of this plan is obviously to give us a currency based on British gold, but are we not better off taking this new currency in the current chaotic financial situation? Everyone answered "yes", so he hoped that experts would convene as soon as possible, without delay, and try to make this change a reality.

Taxpayers Will Definitely Oppose

An official of the Shanghai Municipal Council told the reporter that, in his private opinion, the Shanghai currency is beneficial to the welfare of the Shanghai Municipal Council, but the council would be happy to hear that taxpayers would undoubtedly oppose it, because the income of most taxpayers is in legal tender, and the new currency with an exchange rate of eight pence would increase their tax amount by one. The reporter asked, but if the legal tender continues to fall, and the Shanghai Municipal Council's contracts are mostly calculated in pounds sterling, will there not also be a loss? The official replied that if the legal tender continues to fall, it may be so, but he is not an expert. If the expert decides that the plan can be implemented, then he thinks it is a great idea.

Shipping Companies Think It Will Facilitate Freight

A shipping company, when asked about this matter, replied that a new currency based on British money would be beneficial to his shipping company and ultimately benefit the public. Currently, the company's freight is settled in Hong Kong dollars, so the company's customers have to buy Hong Kong dollars, which are also based on British gold. The merchant concluded by asking, why would a Shanghai currency that could greatly simplify the company's operations generate insurmountable difficulties?

Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Are Considering It

A pharmaceutical manufacturer also praised the proposed new currency. According to him, currently, he has to set the price of his manufactured drugs in British gold, and when selling, he converts the British gold into the legal tender paid by the customer according to the exchange rate. The legal tender he gets cannot be exchanged, and the exchange rate may continue to fall, resulting in losses, etc., which may occur.

Bankers Say It Will Be Opposed

The reporter then asked a senior staff member of a bank in Shanghai about this matter, who said that this idea would be very good if it was not opposed by all sectors in China and Japan when it was implemented, but there are tens of millions of yuan of legal tender circulating in Shanghai. How do you think this huge amount can be exchanged? The Shanghai Municipal Council cannot issue this currency by itself, but must have a large bank do it. He is sure that if the Chinese and Japanese governments do not oppose it, one of the larger banks here is prepared to consider it and issue the new currency. He feels that although there will be some inconveniences, at least as far as foreigners are concerned, those who benefit from this currency will be very numerous.

Most Chinese Depend on Legal Tender

According to another argument that this plan cannot be implemented, even if most Chinese people depend on legal tender, they are not greatly affected except for paying higher prices for taxes, utilities, and imported goods they need. He advocated the establishment of a committee of experts, and hoped that the new currency would be issued as soon as possible without delay.

A Merchant Did Not Express an Opinion

According to one of Shanghai's leading merchants, he has not given much thought to this idea, but when the reporter asked him for a better way to solve the current critical financial problems here, he said that he was not an expert and could not respond.

### Four British Soldiers Detained by Japanese Troops

Released After Three Hours of Negotiation by Officers

Barbed wire has been set up near the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu to prohibit traffic. At the same time, there are Japanese soldiers stationed on the north side, while the North Jiangxi Road area is a British garrison, so British soldiers are also stationed on the south end. At about 4:30 PM yesterday, a truck from the British garrison, carrying four British soldiers, drove through the barbed wire area. For some reason, a verbal misunderstanding suddenly occurred with the Japanese sentries there, and the military vehicle and the four British soldiers were detained by the Japanese sentries because neither side would give in. At that time, the situation suddenly became tense. After talks between officers from both sides, the situation was resolved. The military vehicle and the four British soldiers drove back to the British military camp at about 7:00 PM in the evening.

### Japanese Man Ogawa Killed by Ding's Troops

In Northeast Zhalin

Ogawa Wakao, a Japanese national and police instructor of the Fengxian branch of the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency, was suddenly attacked by dozens of members of Ding Xishan's guerrilla force in the vicinity of Daoyuan Town, northeast of Zhalin, Fengxian on the 26th of this month. At that time, Ogawa and others fought with Ding's troops. As a result, Ogawa was wounded and died on the spot. When the Japanese garrison from Zhalin received the news and went to aid, Ding's troops had already withdrawn. The Japanese side transported Ogawa's body to Shanghai on the 27th. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the Japanese side held a farewell ceremony at the Xiben Yuan Temple on Zhapu Road. The pseudo "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiao'an and others all attended.

### The Lun Chang Labor Strike Remains Deadlocked

Workers Are About to Run Out of Food, the Situation Is Extremely Miserable

The strike at the Lun Chang Textile Factory, a British-owned company in Pudong, has been going on for two months. Because the factory's attitude is stern and it refuses to accept unreasonable conditions that are not related to the workers themselves, it is still difficult for the pseudo authorities to resolve the situation. Some workers previously tried to automatically return to work, but were prevented from doing so. The pseudo authorities also said they were willing to provide relief funds to maintain their livelihoods, but due to current economic difficulties, the funds have not been issued for a long time, resulting in workers running out of food, and the situation is extremely miserable.

### Zhaofeng Park Brass Band Concert

The Shanghai Municipal Council's band is scheduled to hold a brass band concert in Zhaofeng Park from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM on the 30th (weather permitting). The program includes seven items.

### Good News Spreads Frequently, the Financial Market Becomes More Stable, Foreign Exchange Continues to Rise, Securities Rise, Gold Falls

Since the United States abolished the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty and the Soviet Union loaned US$150 million, it is generally believed that the international situation will change and be beneficial to China's anti-Japanese war. As a result, the Shanghai financial market has improved and stabilized, rumors have ceased, and people's hearts are at peace. The details are as follows, obtained by a "New Life News" reporter from the market: (1) Although the British exchange rate quoted by the British HSBC Bank in the black market for foreign exchange is four pence, and the U.S. exchange rate is 7.75 yuan, the actual market rate has continued to rise, calculated at four pence three seven five for the British exchange rate and 8.5625 yuan for the U.S. exchange rate. Swap arbitrage has decreased from one jiao to seven fen. (2) After the gold black market opened yesterday morning, due to the easing of the black market foreign exchange, the decline was very severe. The closing price was 3,595 yuan, the bank quoted price dropped to 365 yuan, and the new market price was 363 yuan. (3) After the securities black market opened yesterday morning, it rose sharply across the board. Unified A, D, and E each rose four jiao, B rose eight jiao, and C rose six jiao. (4) The exchange draft discount has tended to stabilize, and was around 250 yuan yesterday, similar to the previous day, with no significant change.

### Principal and Interest of the Unified Public Bonds Will Be Paid Starting Tomorrow. Shanghai Will Pay in Installments by Draft. The Order Is Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today or Tomorrow.

Since customs revenue in the occupied areas was intercepted, the Ministry of Finance stipulated the method of repaying bonds guaranteed by customs duties from now on, that is, no more overdrafts will be given. As a result, the principal and interest of the Unified Public Bonds due at the end of July were forced to be temporarily suspended. However, the four banks of the Central Bank, the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank allowed discounting and borrowing for the sake of stabilizing the market. Chongqing will pay in full, and Shanghai and other ports will pay in six installments. The details are as follows:

Chongqing Pays Once, Shanghai Pays in Six Installments

The reporter of the "New Life News" learned from the Central Bank yesterday that the four banks of the Central Bank, the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank have allowed discounting and borrowing for the seventh installment of principal and interest of the Unified Public Bonds due on July 31. The method is that the Chongqing head office will pay in full, and Shanghai and other ports will pay in six installments, one installment per month. The payment procedure is roughly the same as the sixth installment, but the "permit for exchange" is changed to "discount certificate." The Shanghai branch has prepared the payment procedures and will implement them after receiving the telegram from the head office.

Payment Will Be Made by Draft or Check

As of last night, the telegram for payment had not yet arrived in Shanghai. It is expected that it will arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow morning. Discounting and borrowing payments can be handled as scheduled tomorrow (ie, July 31). However, the head office has not yet issued an order for whether the payment will be in cash or in Shanghai's common drafts. However, it is expected that the payment will be in drafts. The paying agencies are the Central Bank, the China Bank, and the Bank of Communications. The total amount of principal and interest of the Unified Public Bonds is 56,600,350 yuan.

Unified Public Bonds Rose Sharply Yesterday

The Shanghai securities black market rose sharply in all Unified Public Bonds after the U.S. abolished the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty and the Soviet Union's huge loan was successful. Yesterday's closing prices were as follows: (1) Class A 54 yuan, up four jiao; (2) Class B 45.1 yuan, up eight jiao; (3) Class C 43.2 yuan, up six jiao; (4) Class D 42.3 yuan, up four jiao; (5) Class E 42.65 yuan, up four jiao.

### Gao Guanwu Was Attacked Again

The Murderer Escaped Safely

Gao Guanwu, the "Mayor of the Nanjing Reformed Government," was once poisoned while drinking at a banquet at the Japanese Consulate. On the morning of the 26th, when the "Mayor" Gao was passing through the Confucius Temple area, he was attacked again by a burly man who fired seven or eight shots in a row. The burly man, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, escaped safely. After the incident, a suspect was arrested in a hotel in the south of the city.

### After the Arrest of Thugs, the Concession Tightened Searches. A Man Named Yang Was Not Sent to Court Yesterday. The Case Is Serious and Requires Careful Investigation.

The "China-U.S.-Japan Daily" in Shanghai received 19 threatening letters a few days ago, ordering the newspaper's key employees to resign within three days, promising that they would receive idle pay after leaving their jobs, or they would be assassinated at their residences. The addresses of each person were also indicated on the letters. It is now heard that the police are taking great precautions against this terrorist movement. Therefore, the site of the "China-U.S.-Japan Daily" has been protected by a large number of plainclothes police to prepare for any unexpected events. In addition, the stopping of cars is not allowed on Avenue Edward VII in front of the building. Also, at the intersection of the "Ta Wan Pao," "Ta Lu Pao" and "The Times," a patrolman has been specially assigned to be stationed permanently.

Confiscated Handguns, Arrested Many People

At 4:45 PM yesterday (28th), the police suddenly saw a person dressed in Western clothes, carrying a package, which was very heavy, so they urgently ordered the elevator to stop and arrested him. Upon opening the package, two Mauser pistols and 400 rounds of ammunition were found. After the thug was arrested, he was sent to the Central Police Station. Under interrogation, he claimed that it was for self-defense. After further interrogation, he said that he was an employee of a company near the "Ta Lu Pao". For this reason, all the employees of the company were arrested yesterday.

The Thugs' Plan Is Clearly Visible

According to the police's speculation, the windows of the company overlook the editorial department of the "China-U.S.-Japan Daily," and there is also a small alley there, where the assault case happened last week. According to the intentions of the thugs, it seems that they wanted to fire guns from the window, or invade the newspaper office from the small alley. Although the small alley was closed by the police after the incident, the thugs could still abandon their guns and escape from the door of the "Ta Lu Pao". Also, according to a reporter from "Shanghai Light News," the defendant in the case, a Mr. Yang, was not sent to the Special First Court for trial yesterday morning. The police are still conducting a thorough investigation. A Western newspaper reported that the information on the investigation was inaccurate.

The Major Case Last Week Shocked the City

Since the "China-U.S.-Japan Daily" and "Ta Wan Pao" on Avenue Edward VII, Chang Geng Lane, were suddenly attacked by thugs on Saturday night, resulting in a fierce fight between the detectives and bandits, the number of deaths and injuries was more than 20. Although the police arrested seven suspects, including Shen Yufei, after the incident and sent them to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention, as reported by this newspaper, this action was obviously a large-scale organized and planned operation. Therefore, to prevent it from happening again, the police have specially taken strict precautions in the vicinity of the newspaper offices.

A Man Was Arrested and Taken to the Police Station

Before 4:45 PM the day before yesterday, a man named Yang, holding a paper package, looked flustered and entered the "The Times" Building at 160 Avenue Edward VII. While waiting for the elevator to go upstairs, the doorman and police officers of the building noticed that his appearance was suspicious, so they stepped forward to search him. They found two handguns and many rounds of ammunition in the paper package held by the man and took him to the police station. According to him, he was going to the Dafeng Customs Brokerage Company in Room 319 of the building. After investigation, a rifle and many rounds of ammunition were seized in the Dafeng company.

Still Under Investigation, Not Sent to Court

According to Dafeng personnel, the man named Yang had rented a writing desk in the customs brokerage company to engage in customs declaration affairs. Later, detectives also arrested a suspect named Xu who was involved in the case. They are currently conducting a thorough investigation, so they were not sent to the Special First Court for trial yesterday morning. It is still difficult to know whether the two men, Yang and Xu, are related to the attack on the "China-U.S.-Japan Daily" and other cases, or to other cases, because the police are currently conducting a thorough and secret investigation.

British and French Authorities Conducted Searches at the Same Time

At about 12:00 noon yesterday, the Public Concession Police and the French Concession Police dispatched a large number of detectives to search pedestrians at the north and south ends of Avenue Edward VII. The intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Guangxi Road in the Public Concession and the area west of Avenue Edward VII and Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession were heavily guarded. The French police also parked a armored vehicle there for guard purposes, but nothing was heard to have been gained.

### Speculative Hoarders Dumped Their Stocks, Rice Prices Plunged Yesterday. Rice Samples from Shanghai and China Rice Entered the Market. Early Rice from Pudong Arrived in Shanghai.

In order to continue to handle the adjustment and balance of people's food and reduce the burden on citizens, the Concession authorities are conducting investigations of rice stored in various godowns, reporting the owners of the goods, and distributing notices. The godowns have complied and reported the rice and the investigation started yesterday. Once the examination and approval are completed, the owners will be directly notified to quickly sell the rice in the godowns at the limited prices of 20 yuan per stone of white rice and 16 yuan per stone of other rice. Those who deliberately delay, or use malpractices such as passing off names for transfer, will be severely punished once found.

Market Prices Fall Back, Transactions Increase

The rice market has been quite chaotic in recent days, equivalent to a state of stagnation where there is a market but no transactions. Fortunately, after the joint investigation of rice in the godowns by the two Concession authorities, speculative hoarders who attempted to manipulate the market were greatly panicked and eager to sell and transfer the stocks to avoid accidents. Therefore, after the market opened yesterday morning, rice samples from Shanghai and China entered the market a lot. The market was like a "long-awaited rain after a long drought." Spot goods were flexible, and transactions between buyers and sellers increased sharply. As a result, market prices fell back. Currently, the top grade white rice has entered the 20-yuan range, and other rice has also shrunk back to 15.6 or 15.7 yuan.

Good Harvest This Year, Early Rice Enters the Market

Rice storage in Shanghai is due to domestic rice from the producing areas being illegally banned from leaving the country by the Japanese and puppet authorities, causing merchants to be unable to transport the rice and the source being cut off. Therefore, the authorities are encouraging merchants to resume transportation and trying to dredge the blockage to make up for the shortage. At this moment, the early rice harvest in various places has been reported. According to reporters, the early rice production of Pudong is 100,000 stones. This year, except for the coastal areas that suffered slight typhoon damage, the rest of the areas have a particularly good harvest, with a yield not inferior to previous years. The first batch of new rice samples was brought into the market yesterday for sale, with an opening price of 18.8 yuan and a special grade of broken rice at 19 yuan. In addition, early rice from Jiangyin such as Huangtang, Qiaoqi, and Zhutang, as well as Wuhu in Anhui Province, will also enter the market in early or late August. It is said that this year has been a bumper year due to the suitable climate.

The Source Increases Smoothly, There Is No Panic

Although domestic rice from various producing areas has been banned from leaving the country by the Japanese and puppet authorities, merchants and traders are arguing on the basis of reason and trying to dredge the transportation channels. Therefore, the quantity of the source has increased more smoothly recently than before. The amount transported to Shanghai by the Beijing-Shanghai line yesterday was five cars, and more than 1,200 packages by water. The total amount of rice arriving in Shanghai was more than 3,000 packages. Although the current inventory is not much, the early rice harvest in various places and the stock of old rice in the inland areas are becoming more and more smooth, so there is no need to worry about the people's food in the future.

### It Is Widely Rumored That Japanese Merchants Are Forcibly Using Puppet Currency

20,000 Workers Will Be Affected, Absolutely No Acceptance in North of the Suzhou Creek

The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that it is widely rumored that Japanese industrial merchants operating in western Shanghai are currently considering paying workers with Huaxing tickets, but the ratio is unknown. According to the report, the north shore of Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession does not accept Huaxing tickets. If this plan is implemented, 20,000 workers will be affected.

### Hurricane Changes Direction, Shanghai Can Avoid Being Hit

The Climate Is Not Like Summer Heat, Epidemics Must Be Prevented

According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the two Pacific hurricanes have been tracked. The first new hurricane reached 26 degrees north latitude and 146 degrees east longitude at 6:00 am yesterday, and then remained stagnant and may disappear. The second hurricane had reached 24 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude at 2:00 pm yesterday. Since its direction has turned north-northeast, Shanghai has avoided being hit. The climate in Shanghai is still very cool and unlike summer heat, so it is generally expected that the autumn may be very hot. If so, epidemics must be prevented this year. Judging from the number of patients visiting various epidemic hospitals at present, the daily average is more than 1,000. In the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital alone, the number of daily outpatient visits has exceeded 500. The health threat to Shanghai citizens is extremely significant.

### Guerrillas Set Up Large Cannons Along the Yangtze River and Will Begin to Contend With the Japanese Army, the Japanese Spokesman Admits Clearly

The "North-China Daily News" reported that the Japanese naval spokesman said to reporters yesterday (28th) that guerrillas had set up large cannons along the Yangtze River and had begun to act. These artillery units are located between Anqing and Pukou and have repeatedly exchanged fire with Japanese warships. The mines laid by the Chinese army are being removed today. On Thursday, two mines were removed from the Shantou area. The total number of mines removed from the area has reached 35.

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance to Stop Discounting, Please Quickly Devise Effective Measures

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Thermos Manufacturing Industry Association, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to stop the discounting, the original text is recorded as follows: (1) The Thermos Manufacturing Industry Association said that since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, the government, in order to consolidate the foreign exchange base and prevent the escape of funds, promulgated measures to stabilize finance. At the same time, in order to take care of legitimate commerce, silver houses in the city used draft tickets to reduce the circulation of legal tender. The law was good and the intention was beautiful. Although the city's industrial and commercial circles suffered great pain, they still enthusiastically supported the national policy. Since the implementation of the draft system, the trend of discounting has risen with it. Since the Ministry of Finance issued the Ma telegram, it has risen to a huge amount of more than 200 yuan. The discounting of drafts has long been expressly prohibited, but the industrial circles have to sacrifice painfully in order to conform to the facts. At this time of the decline of all industries, why should we suffer the exploitation and manipulation of a few people again? It is proposed to forward it to the Ministry of Finance to expressly prohibit the Shanghai discounting market in order to be fair. (2) The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegrams, the Chongqing Ministry of Finance Junjian, according to the thermos manufacturing industry, the discount on Shanghai drafts has risen to 200 yuan per thousand, and the cost of purchasing materials in cash has soared. It is requested that you quickly devise effective measures to stop it. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Kan.

### Japanese Troops Obstruct Foreign Vessels in Tianjin

Under the Pretense of Checking for Plague, All Kinds of Obstacles Are Placed on Foreign Vessels

The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that coastal vessels sailing from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Tianjin are expected to be greatly delayed, as Japanese troops have ordered passengers to undergo plague checks at Dagu at the mouth of the Haihe River. The Tianjin Shipping Company has lodged a strong protest against this order, pointing out that the order was issued by the Japanese army and not by any civil official authority. No port in the world has declared Shanghai or Hong Kong

Infected With Plague

This type of inspection is not necessary. According to shipping industry sources, as of today, there have been no cases of plague in the French Concession this year, and only one case in the Public Concession. Only when plague occurs repeatedly and becomes an epidemic can the port be declared "plague-infected" and special inspections ordered. Furthermore, recently, passengers have had to

Prepare an Epidemic Prevention Certificate

The fact that passengers are not infected is also guaranteed. At present, the Japanese military's order, which will be implemented from August 1, is unlikely to find passengers infected with plague. It is believed that this is another step in obstructing foreign interests in China. Shipping companies expect that the arrival of ships at Dagu will be delayed by two to

Five Days

Which will disrupt the ship schedule greatly. There are many people who go to the northern ports to escape the summer heat this year. The delay of ships in Tianjin will disrupt the itinerary of the summer travelers, at least causing inconvenience, and it is quite possible to encounter difficulties.

### Temporary Difficulty in Achieving Navigation Between Shanghai and Wenzhou

### Through Transport Between Shanghai and Kunming; Yong Port Prevents Smuggling

The British company Yi Long, with its ship "Shenguang", planned to restore the Shanghai-Wenzhou route to facilitate passenger and cargo transport. On the 25th, it departed from Shanghai for Wenzhou, but was blocked outside the port due to the port's closure and was unable to enter. The company requested the authorities to allow the transshipment of passengers and cargo via barges, similar to the Shanghai-Ningbo route. According to a New News Agency reporter's inquiry with the company, the ship is still anchored outside Wenzhou port, awaiting instructions from the authorities. Meanwhile, sources in the shipping industry report that the authorities have disapproved the request due to defense concerns, as Japanese warships frequently harass Wenzhou with artillery fire, and defense cannot be relaxed. Therefore, the resumption of the Shanghai-Wenzhou route is temporarily difficult to achieve.

Through Transport Between Shanghai and Kunming

Shipping between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian was once completely interrupted, causing passengers and cargo bound for the interior to concentrate on the coast and detour through Kunming to reach the interior. To facilitate passenger and cargo transport, the shipping industry implemented through transport between Shanghai and Kunming via Saigon, Vietnam. Recently, the French postal ship "Felix Roussel" carried hundreds of tons of goods for this purpose, and Shanghai has received a telegram stating its safe arrival after only ten days. Passenger and cargo transport is now flourishing.

Cargo Transport at Yong Port

The Yong Garrison Headquarters issued a notice to all shipping companies and merchants, stating that the approved import goods have been specifically listed in existing regulations. Any goods not covered by these regulations are not allowed to be imported. Previous regulations dictated that the Zhejiang Provincial Government would make overall arrangements based on actual needs. Therefore, when merchants purchase goods, they must first inquire with the Ningbo Import and Export Cargo Inspection Office. If there are no regulations, they must submit a detailed list of the goods, including type, name, manufacturer, trademark, and quantity, directly to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for approval.

### Currency Exchange Houses Audited for Issuance and Transfer of Funds

### Twelve Million Yuan; Fifteen Houses Unnecessary

After the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee began processing interbank transfers on July 4th, various currency exchange houses provided property as collateral to the committee for issuing and circulating funds. The committee decided to seriously handle the issuance of transfers based on the actual needs of each currency exchange house. The Currency Exchange Association members initially requested ten million yuan, with the association sending letters to each house to determine the amount. The houses subsequently reported their requests, including one house requesting 1.7 million yuan, one house requesting 1.4 million yuan, twenty-four houses requesting amounts ranging from 100,000 to 600,000 yuan, and fifteen houses requesting nothing, totaling twelve million yuan. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Currency Exchange Association held a regular meeting of the standing committee, attended by Ji Ming, Zhang Mengzhou, Xu Wenqing, and Lu Shuchen. They reported the requested amounts from each house. After review and approval, they will be forwarded to the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee.

### Forced Registration for Livestock Market Sales Under Puppet Regime

Since the establishment of the puppet "Livestock Market" by the Japanese puppet organization, it has illegally monopolized the source and manipulated the operation of various livestock such as fresh pork, beef, lamb, chicken, and duck, causing opposition from various industries. The details have been reported previously. According to a Da Guang News Agency reporter's investigation, the puppet "Livestock Market" is forcibly occupying private land at the intersection of Zhaofeng Road and Wuhua Road in Hongkou to build a new puppet "market," which is nearing completion. The Japanese puppet authorities are driving ignorant people to solicit and entice merchants from various industries to participate. However, merchants from various industries, understanding the bigger picture, have decided to refuse cooperation, causing disappointment to the Japanese puppet authorities. Therefore, they have resorted to retaliatory measures, forcing "registration" of transport vessels. All livestock transported from the production area to Shanghai must be carried by transport vessels designated by the puppet "market," otherwise they will be detained. Currently, various industry associations for fresh pork, beef, lamb, chicken, and duck are discussing ways to respond to this illegal oppression.

### Safety Campaign Should Be Permanently Maintained

According to a statement from the Public Concession Bureau of Works, after the Safety Campaign Promotion Week held in the city from June 18th to 24th, the occurrence of accidents has been significantly reduced. Therefore, the authorities will permanently maintain this campaign to reduce unfortunate incidents. Safety signs with the message "Pass Through Here" have been erected at intersections in busy areas such as Yu Qiaqing Road, Racecourse Road, Guangdong Road, and Beihai Road, and safe zones have been designated for pedestrians to cross the road.

### Passenger Ships Arrive in Shanghai One After Another

The British Company's Far East route regular passenger ship "Kauff" came to Shanghai from Europe to Japan on the 9th of this month. It has now returned to Shanghai from Kobe and Yokohama, Japan, and is scheduled to arrive at the port at 1:30 PM today, berthing at buoys 12 and 13. It is reported that this ship's return to Shanghai from Japan is carrying 21 passengers. The ship is scheduled to leave on the 1st of next month at 3:00 PM to return to London. The US President Lines' "President Coolidge" arrived in Shanghai from the United States to Hong Kong and Manila on the 20th of this month. It was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Manila to return to the United States tomorrow (31st), but due to a typhoon that hit Shanghai when it went from Shanghai to Manila, the voyage was delayed by one day. Therefore, the return to Shanghai from Manila will also be delayed by one day, and it will not arrive in Shanghai until 2:30 PM on August 1st. It is scheduled to berth at buoys 11 and 12. The ship is scheduled to leave the next day (2nd) at 8:00 AM to return to the United States.

### Twenty British Missionaries Forced Out of Kaifeng After Threats; Anti-British Movement Erupts After Incitement; Japanese Army Openly Orders Missionaries to Leave Immediately; Only American Missionaries Not Hindered

The Continental Daily News reports that yesterday (28th), news disclosed from this port that about twenty British missionaries were driven out of Kaifeng last week after the most intense intimidation and arrived in Qingdao. Their Chinese staff were also subjected to the same intimidation. Although the details of this matter are not yet fully known, people in this port believe that only the most appalling situation could drive these British people out of the city, because a year ago they were willing to endure the danger of being insulted during the Japanese occupation. Yesterday, Shanghai finally received

Confirmation of Withdrawal

It is said that the British in Kaifeng encountered a situation created by the Japanese-controlled puppet regime that resembled the early days of the Boxer Rebellion, and were forced to leave quickly. After several days of incitement, an anti-British sentiment erupted on July 7th, with angry mobs surrounding two British churches (China Inland Mission and Canadian Church). Both groups had many female staff members. The houses were surrounded by obstacles, and the supply of food and water was cut off. The spokesmen for the mobs ordered the missionaries to leave the city within 24 hours. It is said that the first attackers

Were Muslims

This is the most bizarre point. Those people told the Chinese staff of the church that if they were associated with the puppet groups, they would be given a reward of ten to twelve yuan per month, but the Chinese staff of the church immediately refused despite being deeply afraid of being retaliated against. The riots then continued to occur. The leaders of the two churches immediately went to the headquarters of the Japanese garrison to protest the fact that the Japanese army allowed the riots in the city without intervening. The garrison commander replied that he was very concerned and would investigate. The commander returned a moment later and said that the matter was very dangerous, and that they should leave the city as soon as possible, as "we cannot control your

Anti-British sentiment"

What happened afterwards is not yet known, but the missionaries immediately packed up and took the Longhai Railway train to Xuzhou, and then to Qingdao, which proves the serious nature of the riots. Schools, administrative offices, churches, and staff dormitories were all forced to be abandoned and left unguarded. Even the caretaker of the China Inland Mission church was forced to leave. The fate of this church property, worth hundreds of thousands of yuan, is uncertain. However, Dr. Hayes of the American Southern Baptist Church is expected to exert some influence on the puppet government to urge the puppet government or allow the American Church to protect these properties. The China Inland Mission Hospital

Is Large in Scale

It had about five foreign doctors and several foreign nurses, who were forced by the mobs to evacuate more than 100 patients within a few hours, some of whom had just left the operating room. Since the city was occupied, the refugees in the large refugee camps run by the two churches must have been in great distress, because after the final notice was given by the mobs, the refugees in these refugee camps and the schools within them had all been evacuated. It is said that none of the missionaries were physically harmed. They only took more valuable things with them when they left the city. Before leaving, the mobs told the missionaries that they would never be allowed to enter again. Kaifeng has been a center of church activities for more than 80 years. News that arrived in Shanghai yesterday also stated that before the British withdrew, a large number of American missionaries were not hindered.

### Jin Xuecheng Suddenly Arrested

Jin Xuecheng, the former manager of the China-America Morning Post, a native of Peidong, was suddenly arrested by the Japanese and the Public Concession Police Department at around 8:00 PM the night before last (28th). The location of his arrest was his residence on the third floor of the Tongyi Trust Company at No. 384 Beijing Road and Henan Road. The reason for his arrest is unknown. One source said that he has been transferred to Hongkou.

### Chinese Employees of French Concession Water and Electricity Company Request Wage Increase

### Work Stopped for Two Hours But Not a Strike

The Chinese employees of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, due to the currency devaluation and rising prices of everything, staged a demonstrative work stoppage on the 28th to demand an increase in subsidies from the authorities, causing a verbal dispute. But it was not a strike. After negotiations, they resumed normal work. It is said that the negotiations have not yet yielded results and are still in progress. The Chinese employees of the company have not received a raise since 1937, while the cost of living has gradually increased by more than 40%. Another source said that the work stoppage lasted for about two hours due to the demand for increased wages.

### Difficult to Accommodate Silk Factory Deposits

### Shanghai's Environment Is Unique; The Situation Is Different Than Before

The Silk Factory Association previously requested that import duties be paid in legal tender when cocoons are shipped to Shanghai. If withdrawals are made weekly, it would take too long, so they requested accommodation to remove the restrictions. After sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, they received a reply stating that the Ministry's decision to restrict deposits was originally intended to stabilize the financial situation and prevent the arbitrage of foreign exchange. The current environment in Shanghai is unique and different from the situation during the August 13th incident. Therefore, the request to be exempt from deposit restrictions cannot be granted.

### Several Cargo Ships Detained Near Huangdu

At around 4:00 PM on the 28th, several small steam launches returning to Shanghai from the interior towing several civilian boats were attacked near Huangdu. Several cargo ships were detained. After inspection, the small steam launches were released. To avoid danger, westbound flights have been reduced or suspended. The routes to Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhujiajiao, etc., scheduled for the 29th, have all been temporarily postponed. Armed Japanese soldiers are now patrolling the river surface around Beixinjing in motorboats, inspecting ships.

### The Style of Pei Qing, A Prominent Figure in the Money Exchange Industry

-- Yu Zhai

Mr. Pei Yunqing is a respected native of Songxia Town, Shangyu, Zhejiang. Anyone who has been to Songxia will nod and say "good" from the bottom of their hearts when they mention him. This is not accidental. If he did not care about his hometown and benefit his fellow villagers, he would not have such a reputation. It is a typical small medieval town, without the influence of foreign culture and very few modern decorations. The simple folk customs and honest habits have shaped Mr. Pei's current indifferent life. A gray cloth gown is his usual dress and his most solemn formal wear. Even now, he still uses a carriage. Whenever someone advises him to buy a car instead, he always smiles and shakes his head, saying: "Thank you, I always value practicality and don't pursue superficiality. I don't feel the need to ride in a car yet!" His frugality is evident here.

I remember that it was on the Dragon Boat Festival that I received an invitation from him. I went as scheduled and found that those invited were mostly people with more reputation. He solemnly invited us to be seated, but saw that the table was only set with five vegetarian dishes and five meat dishes. This could not help but surprise the guests, thinking that for such a grand banquet, the dishes would be so simple. Perhaps the home-cooked meals of a sophisticated family would be much more exquisite. But in the end, everyone was moved by his great personality and felt that this time, it was more flavorful than eating those delicacies.

He is already nearly sixty years old this year. Although his temples are gray, he still looks like a middle-aged person. I have never seen him show any signs of aging for even a minute. That is to say, no matter when and no matter what he is dealing with, he is always fully focused and has never shown any signs of distraction or depression. I once admired him and said, "Your spirit is really admirable. It can be said that you deserve the title of 'old and strong'." His reply was: "Old? It's really too early. Facts and responsibilities show us that we must not fail to summon up our spirits to engage in it. Spirit is the driving force of all work. In fact, as long as you grasp the interest in your career and understand the importance of responsibility, the spirit will naturally follow you."

He has been in Shanghai for forty-four years. He started out as a student in a money exchange shop. He was determined to only work hard and not ask for harvest. He struggled hard for decades and created his current position as one of the leading figures in the money exchange industry in this port. He often uses flexible diplomacy to cope with difficult external work. He treats people fairly and honestly, and he is not willing to relax his own moral character easily. Filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, etiquette, righteousness, and shame are the conditions for him to build his personality. And not gambling, especially not even smoking, is even more commendable. He uses his personality to influence his subordinates, never deceiving himself or others. His reasoning starts with old morality and ends with new morality, melting old and new morality into one furnace. In his simply decorated but very meaningful office, and even in his staff's office, you can find striking and alarming maxims and slogans. He also printed a small booklet of "Amulet Maxims" and distributed it to the public to save the declining social customs. His painstaking efforts can be imagined.

A meeting with a leader in the money exchange industry is often very busy. The day before yesterday, I wanted to visit him. I first gave him a call to ask him when it would be most convenient, and his answer was 7:00 AM every day. I really doubted it, suspecting that I had misheard, because in Shanghai, visiting a reputable friend at 7:00 AM is really rare. So, at 6:50 AM yesterday morning, I got into the car, but then thought that it might be too early. I temporarily changed direction and went to the west of Shanghai to take some fresh air. After circling around for a big lap, when I got to his office, the watch was pointing to 7:25 AM. Who knew that when I ran in, there were already three guests sitting in the room, and they were finishing their conversation. I couldn't help but say "ashamed" in my heart. Although it was not intentional, at least I had not been able to fully understand him.

Many documents were messily piled on the table. He told me that he had already handled a lot of official business at that time. He said: "Because my mind is clearer in the morning, I handle many things in the morning. At the same time, I also let Jiande learn how to handle things."

Mr. Jiande is Mr. Pei's eldest son. He is now working in the China Trust Company. He is diligent, thrifty, and simple, and he is very much like his father. He is deeply valued by his superiors. Before 9:00 AM every morning, he also helps his father with business. He is truly carrying on his father's legacy.

Mr. Pei is fond of lotus. Outside the office, there is a very exquisite flower garden, where various flowers are planted. In the center is a lotus tank, in which several lotus flowers stand upright, swaying in the wind, making his noble character even more prominent. The clear morning dew rolled around like silver beads. I imagined a section of snow lotus root lying across his roots, emerging from the mud without being stained, which is truly the most accurate symbol of Mr. Pei.

Mr. Pei is such a typical character: "His age is a laggard of the times, his career is catching up with the times, and his thoughts and actions are always standing in front of the times."

I have been neglecting ink for a long time. Because of the influence of Mr. Pei's cultivation, I have a deep impression, so I just wrote a little to introduce him to the readers.

### Dispute Arises Over Buying and Selling Old Bricks and Iron Materials Under Artillery Fire; Wu Songhe and Bao Chengde Accused

Xie Fuqing, a wealthy real estate businessman residing at No. 31 Qingyun Lane, Yuyuan Road (63 years old), hired lawyer Tang Youwei as his agent and filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Wu Songhe, a local resident residing at No. 4 Huaan Lane, Xujiahui Road, and Bao Chengde, manager of Jianghai Bank on Ningbo Road (currently residing at No. 7 Yunshou Lane, Yuyuan Road), seeking

Repayment

of a debt of 3,760 yuan. It is claimed that the first defendant, Wu Songhe, purchased the remaining old bricks and iron materials from Yuqing Lane, Meiyuan Road, Jiqing Lane, and Juqing Lane on Hanzhong Road, Zhabei in October of last year, stating that the price would be 4,100 yuan and that all shipping matters would be handled by the buyer at his own expense and would not involve the plaintiff. At that time, in addition to paying a deposit of 300 yuan, the remaining 3,760 yuan would be paid in full after the permit was issued

Transport

After it was clear, it was guaranteed by the second defendant, Bao Chengde. After purchasing the old bricks and iron materials, the first defendant immediately sold them to Wanli Foreign Company at a high price, and the company obtained a permit. It had already been transported away in its entirety last winter. On the one hand, it falsely claimed to the plaintiff that the old materials had all been moved away by the Japanese military, so it was not liable for payment, etc. Afterwards, the plaintiff entrusted an agent lawyer to send a letter to the so-called "Zhabei Police Station" and the "Social Affairs Bureau" for

Investigation

After the investigation, it was found that it was indeed transported by Wanli Foreign Company. Under such circumstances, it is clear that the defendants are undoubtedly trying to deny the debt. After receiving the complaint, the court ordered Judge Wu Xiaoke to come to the Civil Division to summon the parties yesterday. Both parties were represented by agent lawyers. The plaintiff's agent lawyer stated the process as above. The court immediately ordered the debate to begin and then stated that the case was clear and set a date for sentencing on August 3.

### Woman Abuses Adopted Daughter; Forcing Her into Prostitution and Beating and Burning Her; Escapes the Trap; Woman Arrested Awaiting Investigation

Yu Xinnian, a girl from Suzhou, is 15 years old this year. In February of this year, her stepfather sent her to Zhou Yuan, a woman from Suzhou at No. 73, Hongfu Lane 66, Xinzha Road, as an adopted daughter. However, she was violent in nature and often abused her, and also burned her with a hot copper brazier, causing her to be unbearable. She secretly escaped on the night of the 17th of this month, wandering on the road for three days and nights. On the night of the 20th at about 9:00 PM, Yu was discovered by detectives from the French Concession Police on Xujiahui Road, taken to the police station, and interrogated. It was then transferred to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detective Deng Hailin to arrest Zhou Yuan and detain her at the police station. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit under Article 286 of the Criminal Law for the crime of abuse.

### Arrest of Tailor for Murdering Wife: Cai Wang's Right Hand Severed, Cai Jingen Detained for Investigation and Trial

Cai Jingen, a local resident and tailor residing at No. 1 Triangle Land, Xujiahui Road, married a woman surnamed Zhu from his hometown three years ago through a matchmaker. Initially, the couple's relationship was harmonious, but later, disagreements arose frequently, leading to

constant quarrels.

Last November, Cai Wang left in anger and became a servant in the home of a Westerner in western Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Cai recently discovered that his wife's conduct was improper and that she was having an affair with a ticket seller. Therefore, on the night of the 5th of this month, around 7 pm, he secretly hid a kitchen knife and ambushed her with accomplices at the intersection of Great West Road and Columbia Road in western Shanghai. As soon as Cai Wang arrived, they stopped her,

pulled out the knife,

and hacked at her. At that time, her right hand was severed by the knife, and she sustained a total of twenty-one knife wounds on her head and back. Overwhelmed with pain, she collapsed to the ground, and blood gushed out like a spring. Subsequently, Chinese detective Yao Changmin of the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrived after receiving a report, arrested Cai Jingen, and took him and the knife to the police station. He also transported Cai Wang to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Cai to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The victim, Cai Wang, also

arrived in court injured.

Her right hand had been completely severed, and her head and face were wrapped in gauze. She sat and was interrogated. She stated that her husband did not engage in honest work but instead indulged in idleness. She was forced to go out and work as a servant. The defendant also came to demand money from time to time, and if he was not satisfied, he would beat her. She realized his intention was to kill her and requested an investigation. When questioned, Cai Jingen confessed that his wife had an affair with a ticket seller, so he injured her. Judge Fu instructed that the defendant be detained for a rescheduled hearing on the 8th of next month.

### Finance: Eagerness to Settle Forward Foreign Exchange, Swap Points Squeezed Accordingly

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listing. In the informal market, the British and American exchange rates were buoyed by news that the international situation was more favorable to China and that a large loan agreement had been reached between China and Russia. This news cleared the gloom that had hung over the foreign exchange market for the past two weeks and greatly stabilized sentiment. Speculators were unable to use their usual tactics. At the opening, foreign firms were reluctant to sell, but the market was supported by strong selling interest from outsiders. Subsequently, the Bombay Silver Company, Western merchant Sassoon, and Chinese speculators all competed to sell. The eagerness to settle August contracts was especially strong, so August prices were lower than spot prices. Swap points were squeezed accordingly. Based on the midday closing bank selling rates, the British gold point difference was 375 and the US dollar point difference was 75, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of about 9.4%. However, arbitrageurs only earned 7.78%, leading to a sharp decline in arbitrage transactions. Most of the half-day's trading involved futures.

Spot and Forward Loosen in Tandem

In the morning, London silver futures were up 1.875 on the near-term contract and up 1.25 on the far-term contract. New York silver prices were stable, and London gold remained flat. Exchange rates saw the pound rise slightly against the dollar by three points, fall against Shanghai by 25 points, and remain unchanged against the franc. The dollar was unchanged against the pound, up 2.5 points against Shanghai, and up 0.0625 against the franc. The central bank's listed rates for all currencies remained the same. At the opening, banks quoted spot selling rates of 4.34375 for British gold and 8.4375 for the US dollar, up 0.03125 and 0.0625 respectively from the previous close. After the opening, Japanese and foreign firms successively sought to settle, but the market was stable because outsiders were willing to sell. Japanese Zhenjin first settled spot British gold at 4.375, followed by foreign firms purchasing spot British gold from HSBC and other foreign banks at 4.34375 and spot US dollars at 8.4375 from an American bank. When the HSBC listing was announced, there were no changes. After the announcement of the silver equalization tax, the exemption remained unchanged. Afterwards, Japanese Zhenjin and others suddenly wanted to sell. The August British gold price rose from 3.8125 to 3.875, but outsiders were unwilling to buy, resulting in difficulty in finding trades. The Bombay Silver Company, Western merchant Sassoon, and Chinese speculators all competed to sell. August British gold was sold to the British Bank and China-Belgium Bank at prices ranging from 3.9375 to 4.0625. August US dollars were sold to Datong and Yun Tong at prices ranging from 7.75 to 8. At the same time, spot British gold was sold back to the British Bank at 4.375 and 4.0625, and spot US dollars were resold to a certain bank at 8.5625, causing spot prices to loosen. By noon, outsiders' selling interest was also strong, but trading was quiet. By the midday close, banks quoted spot selling rates of 4.4375 for British gold and 8.625 for the US dollar, and August British gold at 4.0625 and US dollars at 7.875. As a result, spot British gold was down 0.125 and the US dollar was down 0.25 from the previous day, with even greater loosening in the August contracts. There was no afternoon session due to Saturday.

### Scattered Selling Continues to Emerge, Gold Prices Plunge, Daily Fluctuations Narrow, Volume Approximately 700 Taels

Yesterday's cash gold informal market was slightly mediocre, with a volatile and unpredictable trend. Sentiment was generally weak, due to the prevailing political situation. The U.S. abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and the U.K.'s supportive statements were perceived as turning the tide in China's favor. General operators expected a possible breakdown in Anglo-Japanese negotiations. Scattered retail investors continued to unload holdings. The morning opening traded as low as $3,620. Subsequently, securities firms took advantage of the low prices to buy, and a certain gold shop also purchased on behalf of speculators. The market briefly rebounded to $3,670. However, the foreign exchange spot market tightened, the securities firms ceased purchases and began to square positions. Prices once again turned downwards, dropping to the day's low of $3,595 by the midday close. This represented a further fall of $100. There was no official market in the afternoon, but reports suggested that underlying sentiment had strengthened, with prices rebounding to $3,620. Morning trading saw numerous small transactions and few large block trades, with a total volume of approximately 700 taels. Gold jewelry fell $10. Shanghai Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Cash Gold Drops Another $100

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at $3,620, reflecting the momentum of the previous day. A money exchange shop sold ten taels to a gold shop at $3,620. Subsequently, securities firms and a certain Yu shop (acting for speculators) stepped in to buy. Although a certain silver building sold on behalf of wealthy bulls, the demand still outweighed the supply, and the market rose, gaining $50. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange shop and 10 taels from a silver building at $3,670, the day's high. News that the foreign exchange spot market had strengthened caused sentiment to waver, and buyers turned cautious. A money exchange shop forcefully sold dozens of taels. The price soon dropped $30. A money exchange shop sold 40 taels to a securities firm at $3,640. The securities firm also suddenly turned bearish, weakening underlying sentiment, and the price broke through the $3,600 level. The securities firm sold 50 taels to a money exchange shop at $3,590. Afterwards, a certain gold shop bought more than 100 taels on behalf of a speculator, and the scarcity of sellers caused prices to rise sharply by $65. A certain gold shop bought 20 taels from a money exchange shop at $3,660. At 11:30, news that the foreign exchange market had strengthened triggered selling, and the market weakened again. By the midday close, a silver building sold 20 taels to a money exchange shop at $3,595, the midday closing price. Reports indicated that underlying sentiment remained stable after the close, with trades reported at $3,600. The afternoon session was suspended due to the foreign exchange market being closed on Saturday. Based on the midday closing price of $3,595, the price fell $100 from the previous session, with a fluctuation range of $75 for the half-day. The cash gold shops' listed selling price was $10 higher than the informal market price, and the current standard gold price was approximately $50 lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, trading was extremely quiet.

Jewelry Gold Listing Down a Little Ten Dollars

The initial exchange price for jewelry gold per tael at major silver buildings remained at $375. At 9:48 AM, it was lowered by $5, and at 11:50 AM, it was lowered again by $5. There were no further changes. The major silver buildings' listed price was $365, and the new silver buildings' listed price was $363. The buy-in price was reduced by approximately $10 to $20.

Sino-British Pure Gold Unchanged

A London dispatch on the 28th stated that the price of pure British gold remained at £7 8s 6.5d per ounce, and the Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash remained at $1,212.6. The listed Shanghai Customs gold remained flat at $2.396. The Shanghai Standard Gold price also remained unchanged at $1,210.9.

### Foreign Currencies Fall Again, U.S. and British Currencies Fall Three Dollars

Yesterday, foreign currencies weakened as the foreign exchange market continued to loosen and the cash gold market fell sharply. The supply of U.S. and British currencies increased, and the market loosened. The selling of gold notes was very smooth, and demand decreased. Hong Kong and French notes fell sharply. Few buyers were seen collecting them in the market. Japanese gold notes were not dared to be collected. The market price fell by about 4 cents to $1.07 in the evening session. There was little supply and demand for Korean notes, which remained at 89 cents. In the public association trading, Qin Tai sold 2,000 French notes to Tong Feng, and 150 yuan of Roby notes. Yong Feng sold 300 yuan of Annam notes to Fu He Xiang. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds decreased by $1.50, gold notes decreased by $1.40, U.S. gold pounds decreased by $3, gold notes decreased by 25 cents, Hong Kong notes decreased by 5 cents, French francs decreased by 3 li, Singapore notes decreased by 10 cents, Dutch and Annam notes each decreased by 5 cents, Canadian notes decreased by 50 cents, Philippine notes decreased by 30 cents, and Australian gold notes decreased by $1.80. Only a few remained unchanged.

### Discount Rate Rises Slightly

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange rose slightly. The price per thousand yuan fluctuated around $255 in the morning and rose to $260 in the afternoon, but soon fell back to $257.5, an increase of $2.5 from the previous day. The Shanghai Money Industry Association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 20 cents in both the morning and afternoon sessions.

### Indian Silver Also Rises

A London dispatch on the 28th stated that Indian and speculative short covering, with little supply, stabilized the market. After the close, India inquired about prices at 0.0625 higher than the listed price, but there were very few transactions. Large silver bars were up 1.875 on the near-term contract and up 1.25 on the far-term contract. A New York silver dispatch stated that the U.S. spot price remained stable. A Bombay silver dispatch stated that the Indian silver market was firm, with the spot price up 6 annas and both futures contracts up 9 annas. A total of 200 contracts were traded.

### Securities: Internal Debt Turns Around

Yesterday's securities informal market continued to be good, and market sentiment has improved. The gloom of the past month has gradually dissipated. After the United States announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and took further measures, there were also rumors of large loans from the Soviet Union to China. It can be seen that there are still people willing to help in times of need. This situation was a blow to Japan psychologically, and it was like a refreshing remedy for China, greatly boosting morale. The market's sluggish sentiment was immediately excited, and buying interest was strong. However, large investors were still selling, so the increase was limited. However, the price increased by another dollar in the informal market, and the situation has improved. Principal and interest are no longer a problem, and there is a glimmer of hope. Yesterday, Dafeng, Lianyi, and No. 38 were actively bought at the opening, but No. 20 and No. 64 still had a large supply, so the rise was firm but not sharp. Later, Defu and Zhenkang were still willing to buy, while Tongyu Datong continued to sell, so the result was only slightly better by 4 to 8 cents. After the close, gold firms had a need, so the informal market could rise by about one yuan. The total number of transactions was about 780,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.

There were no stock transactions yesterday. The report of the public stock exchange stated that yesterday morning was the beginning of the new week's trading. Market atmosphere was good, and prices were generally high. The foreign exchange market was slightly stable because the difference between the spot price and the August price was smaller. The good market atmosphere was also due to this reason. If short-term foreign exchange arbitrage continues to be huge, a large amount of currency will be invested in the foreign market, which will negatively affect investors.

### Sugar Market: Mixed Ups and Downs

Yesterday's sugar market, according to London telecommunications, had slight ups and downs. August rose 0.75 to 7 shillings 0.75, December was 6 shillings 2.5 pence, and March of next year was 6 shillings 2.75 pence, all up by a small halfpenny. The public association's quoted price for 24 coarse white spot was a small triangle. The price at the local warehouse was 34 yuan, the price at the foreign warehouse was 33 yuan 80 cents, and the price for re-export goods was a small 25 cents at 25 yuan 65 cents. Taikoo truck white also rose 2,3,4 cents. B mark East warehouse 38 yuan 20 cents, West warehouse 38 yuan 50 cents, BC mark 38 yuan 20 cents, CX mark 37 yuan 80 cents, DY mark 37 yuan 40 cents, HHX mark 37 yuan 20 cents. The spot price of Dutch red sugar rose 40 cents to 29 yuan 20 cents, and the re-export price rose 10 cents to 22 yuan 30 cents. Local refined white sugar rose by a small half yuan. Zhenji No. 1 was 33 yuan 50 cents, No. 2 was 33 yuan, No. 3 was 32 yuan 50 cents, and No. 4 was 31 yuan. Chao Bang opened a hundred or so bags of domestic sugar red sugar, rising to 31 yuan. 275 bags of newly arrived oil-packaged Hainan red sugar were 20 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong and Yunnan Sell Well, Unpopular Yarn

The yarn market first fell and then rebounded, but generally remained in a state of fluctuation. Although the volume of cotton yarn transactions was not large, most of the transactions were actual transactions, so sentiment was stable. In addition, inland merchants who mainly purchased Japanese yarn have recently found that the price of unpopular Chinese yarn is cheaper. Merchants' calculations prioritize profit. Therefore, unpopular yarn has a glimmer of hope. Some say that the concept of using domestic products is deeply ingrained in the areas of southern China, Hong Kong, and Yunnan. New factories are promoting Chinese yarn in these areas because the price is 70-80 yuan to 100 yuan cheaper. Why should they specialize in one or two brands of yarn and be manipulated without giving up?

The current yarn situation: The market opened in the morning with general terror rumors being self-defeating and sentiment being very calm. In addition, the heat of various speculative tools has decreased uniformly, and the commercial market has moved towards a peaceful path. Speculative transactions have decreased. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn at the foreign warehouse was 555 yuan, and the warehouse order price was 544 yuan, falling by 2-3 yuan. Before long, news that the foreign exchange market had strengthened caused selling to increase slightly, falling another 3-4 yuan. The 20-count Double Horse yarn price at the foreign warehouse fell to 550 yuan, and the warehouse order price fell to 541 yuan. By the close, news that inland merchants had some need for the local yarn caused sentiment to rise, and prices rebounded a few yuan. According to statistics, 765 packages were traded in the half-day. The market was relatively stable. Yong'an Factory opened 120 packages of 10-count Special Jincheng yarn at a price of 640 yuan. These were purchased by Hong Kong merchants. It was found that 1,690 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong today (the 30th), and 350 pieces were transported to Beihai, 90 pieces were transported to Haikou, 20 pieces were transported to Guangzhou Bay, and 750 pieces were transported to Haiphong. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below.

Hong Kong 220 Inland 200

Same Industry 315 Xiamen 10

Statistics 765 Previous Day's Transactions 66

The Japanese yarn market was peaceful because the short squeeze for this month was over. There was some demand in the north, but foreign firms were very picky about the few packages of one or two popular cotton yarns they took in. The spot price of 20-count Yueqin was 430 yuan.

### Indian Cotton Arrives Daily, Foreign Firms Sell at Low Prices, Payment in One Month

The domestic cotton business has become quiet. Only Meiyin Cotton's Japanese Daikang factory has a slight need, purchasing 500 pieces. This batch of goods is all sold to the spot market by fellow traders. Huashang Rongfeng Factory imported 300 pieces of 10-count coarse yarn raw material Pingguoer. Because the discount on the French currency is high and credit is tight, they had to switch to purchasing at the exchange rate price. Therefore, today's transactions are less than in the previous two days, which is due to the financial contraction. The future of the cotton market is also in a state of uncertainty. The source of Su North cotton has withered again. Only 18 bales of Tonghua arrived at the pier. The current cotton situation is as follows.

Foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was more active in the morning. The Liverpool and Bombay telecommunications reported high increases, and there were many transactions among the industry. It is generally expected that in the near future, Japan may purchase US cotton due to the US cotton subsidy. However, prices fell slightly due to the large number of bank and foreign sellers. As a result, the closing price fell 7-8 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian prices, including forecasts, increased by more than 1 rupee, and Egyptian prices increased by more than 10 pounds.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trading: With the exception of a small amount of the current Japanese factories' small inventory and the bargain price purchase of 1-2,000 pieces of Indian cotton, the payment terms are unusually preferential and payment is due at the end of August. Many Japanese cotton shipments arrived. Yesterday, another 3,000 pieces of Indian cotton were shipped. A large number of cotton shipments are expected to arrive at the beginning of next month.

Indian cotton continues to arrive. The British company's cargo ship Nagpore shipped 3,091 tons of cotton from Bombay. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. According to the company, the ship arrived yesterday morning and docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong to unload. It is said that another ship is also shipping cotton from Bombay to Shanghai. The quantity is slightly more than the amount imported yesterday. It is expected to arrive on the 4th of next month.

### Grains: Abundant Harvest in Dongxin, Coming to Market Soon, Wuhu Lifting Restrictions

Domestic Rice: New early rice from Pudong has been sampled on the market, but the goods have not yet arrived. The quantity is only 25 stone. As for the quality, it is excellent. According to the owner, the new Dongxin rice is being launched on the market earlier this year, half a month earlier than last year. Because the year is abundant with favorable weather conditions, there is an 80% harvest. It can be transported to Shanghai in a steady stream later. At a time when rice prices are chaotic, this is good news that can comfort people. Yesterday's sources from all directions were still scarce. Over 1,000 bags of passenger wheel packaged rice arrived, but there were still no samples on the market. Only 16 yuan of the filming of the rice and 2,450 bags of 22 yuan's altered rice were carried out.

Passenger Xiang Rice: Yesterday, neither inland nor industry-owned warehouses made inquiries. Only 2,000 bags or so were from various households on the street. The Wuhu opening ban has been decided to be implemented. It is rumored that the fee is increased by 20 cents, and transfer certificates from Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other places are issued. Only Shanghai has not been approved yet. But since the inland area has been cleared, the Shanghai stock will not be transferred to the inland area, and the inland's high-end high-quality new rice can also be transferred to Shanghai. Therefore, sentiment has been falling and the passenger warehouses are competing to sell. The general market's machine made new rice is sold at a limited price of 16 yuan, and the final new rice is 15 yuan 60-70 cents. The damaged new rice is 15 yuan 30-40 cents to 15 yuan or so, which is a difference of 4-5,7,8 cents from the previous market. The price dropped by 4-5 cents. Foreign rice is deemed expensive because the passenger xiang rice has fallen sharply, and importers no longer make inquiries.

### Flour Factory Market: Reached 5 Yuan Cash, Sharp Increase of 15 Cents

The current flour market is experiencing a strong price increase. The market price for No. 2 flour has reached 5 yuan in cash, an increase of 15 cents compared to the foreign exchange. It is reported that the price of returned goods has also increased to 4 yuan 90 cents in cash, a difference of 10 cents from the factory price. However, the market for returned goods is exhausted, and there is no available goods to purchase. Yesterday's trading by local buyers was still active, but large groups were still lacking. Currently, the production of each flour factory has decreased and they are unwilling to supply as much as possible. A total of 30,000 bags were traded in the general market, all of which were purchased in small quantities by local buyers. According to industry insiders, flour prices are still cheap in the context of rising prices of everything else. Therefore, the factory market price has reached 5 yuan, which may be temporarily fixed.

Wheat market: There was little arrival and sales, and the market still felt strong. Because the arrivals have all been stacked in the warehouses to wait for an opportunity, and the flour market increased by 15 cents yesterday, wheat, as the raw material for flour, should of course also increase. However, the factory appetite is still weak. Although there were inquiries from local warehouses, they still had intentions to choose the goods selectively. Therefore, the market could not be too good. A total of 1,100 bags or so of Kunshan, Puzhen, Wuyi, Nanjing, and other wheats were sold at a price of 6 yuan 73 cents to 48 cents, which was 2-3 cents higher than before. These were still purchased by the warehouse side.

### Oil Cakes　Soybean Oil Plunges Sharply　Abrupt Drop of Four to Five Yuan from Highest Price　Soybean Cake Hoarders Release Stock, Price Also Drops

Soybean Oil　The market was excessively excited, but due to sluggish actual sales, prices were difficult to maintain and suddenly plummeted. Yesterday's market price dropped abruptly by four to five yuan compared to the highest price on the 25th of this month. A total of 20 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were traded at a price of 47 yuan, and 30 barrels of Kobe oil from Dalian were traded at a price of 46.5 yuan. It was found that 150 pieces of soybean oil were shipped from Qingdao yesterday, plus 500 cans, and 300 cans of raw oil also arrived. Today, 335 cans of oil are being shipped to Hong Kong.

Soybean Cake　Due to the gradual decline in sales, major hoarders are eager to release their stocks, resulting in ample selling pressure. Prices have fallen through the three-yuan mark. A total of 3,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji cake were traded, with prices falling from 2.93 yuan to 2.84 yuan. 2,000 pieces of miscellaneous brand cakes were traded at prices ranging from 2.85 yuan to 2.82 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of Yantai cake were traded at 2.83 yuan.

### Piece Goods　Blue Cloth Sales are Most Active　Bidding Prices Rise More Than Fall

Domestic Cloth

Recently, various merchant guilds, aware of the firm and high prices of goods, are all purchasing quickly. As a result, the trade in cloth from near and far has developed. Blue cloth is in the highest demand, with bidding prices rising by three to five jiao. 16-pound coarse white cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. Prices of other goods also rose in unison. The Shandong guild continued to purchase over 100 bales of Dasheng Yihua 16-pound coarse cloth. The Subei Ju Ning guild purchased over 2,000 bolts of blue cloth and other goods. The Yunnan guild purchased over 2,500 bolts of colored cloth, printed crepe, colored satin, fine twill, and bleached cloth. The Nanhua, Hangqian, Taikoo, and Yihua shipping companies will revise their regulations for water freight starting at the end of July, with all payments to be made in Hong Kong dollars, an increase of about 30% compared to the old regulations. Therefore, all goods that have been booked are being rushed for shipment. The Guangdong guild newly added over 3,000 bolts of woolen cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and corduroy. The Nanyang guild purchased over 2,000 bolts of plain colored muslin, printed cambric, blue cloth, and bleached cloth. Wholesale firms on this street are adding over 100 pieces of white cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, etc., due to increased orders from customers in Hangzhou and Changzhou.

Eastern Cloth

Yesterday's market for fine white cloth and fine twill was quiet, with stable bidding prices. Spot prices for Dragon Head fine cloth were 15.3 yuan. No forward contracts were opened by brokers. Over 300 bales of spot and forward goods were traded on this street, and the market was calm.

Exports

Today, 1,140 pieces of cloth were shipped to Haiphong, 45 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 15 pieces to Beihai, and 170 pieces to Hong Kong.

### French Western Shirting Suddenly Rises

Woolen fabrics remained firm and increased yesterday. French Western shirting also rebounded. Yesterday, English-made Love 277 brand, wholesale price rose to 1.2 yuan per yard net. Domestic Hongsheng brand was 0.7 yuan, and Huaxing Iron Pagoda was 0.6 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands made entirely of wax yarn were sold for 0.54 yuan.

### Metals　Prices for White Lead Sheets Already High

The trading of white lead sheets reached two to three hundred barrels yesterday. It was found that the destination was local battery factories and printing houses. In addition, tea warehouses, cigarette factories, and toy factories also purchased a small amount. Overseas orders were not many, and local inventory was low, so holders are considering hoarding. The asking price has risen by about 100 yuan compared to the previous price. Currently, No. 2 is sold for 460 yuan per barrel, No. 3 for 450 yuan, No. 4 for 440 yuan, No. 5 for 430 yuan, No. 6 for 420 yuan, No. 7 and No. 8 are both priced at 400 yuan, and No. 9 and No. 10 are priced at around 440 yuan. Other thick patterned ones require 450 to 500 yuan, and prices vary. Purchases are also rarer than thin patterned ones.

### Seafood　Ningzi Light Offerings are Fresh

Ningzi light offerings have long been sold out and the market has been quiet for a long time. The first batch of new goods only arrived recently and was immediately sold at 125 yuan. Mingda large size three-four and Yuan Dan will have to wait until autumn to be available, and there is currently no market.

### Insect Goods are Scarce and the Market is Firm

Due to the scarcity of insect goods recently, the market feels quite short, but the demand is not declining, and the trend is firm. Currently, Ningbo insects are sold for 30 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous price, and large ones are 35 yuan. Inventory is even scarcer and very popular.

### North-South Goods　Source of Sichuan Pickled Mustard Greens Blocked Again　Price Gradually Increases

Sichuan pickled mustard greens could previously come directly from Hankou and fell to 43-44 yuan. However, this route has recently been blocked again, and the price has gradually increased. Currently, Leqi mustard greens are selling for 70 yuan, and Peiling mustard greens are 60 yuan.

### Coal　Bituminous Coal is Firm

Actual sales of bituminous coal are stagnant, with only local factories making slight purchases. However, sellers are quite firm and unwilling to sell easily, so asking prices are very high. Yesterday, a certain foreign firm traded several hundred tons of lump coal for cash, with Hokkaido coal priced at 58 yuan per ton, and regular coal at 52 yuan, ex-warehouse. Labor for barge loading and unloading is extra.

### Medicinal Materials　Sales of Foreign Camphor Revive

Sales of foreign camphor were previously slow, but recently, due to sudden changes in foreign exchange rates, costs have increased dramatically. Therefore, those in the city with inventory are taking the opportunity to sell. Yesterday, a merchant guild bought a batch at a price of 320 yuan, and now it has risen again, with asking prices of 350-360 yuan, and the market is quite active.

### Hong Kong Guilds Actively Purchase Bitter Almonds

The season for new bitter almonds has arrived, but no goods have arrived in Shanghai yet. It was found that the old goods stored here have also been sold successively. Previous prices for high-grade goods reached 60 yuan. Recently, Hong Kong guilds have been in high demand, but due to the lack of goods in the market, only a small batch was traded at a price of 62 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan.

### A True Man Should Not Be a Sinner in Love

A true man should stand tall and upright, never letting down others or himself. Standing in his position in the times, he can advance or retreat, be flexible and adaptable. Such a husband is a capable member of society and the nation, and the most ideal partner for modern women. Because he has abundant energy and a sharp mind, he will surely surpass others in studying and be more successful in his work. When it comes to love, he will be even more passionate and joyful, leading to incomparable happiness. Giving birth to smart and clever sons and daughters can further achieve the goal of eugenics. This is so glorious and meaningful! However, there is also a type of husband who, despite being a dignified man, is rejected by his wife and becomes a sinner in love. What is the reason for this? According to medical analysis, it must be due to early indulgence in masturbation and nocturnal emissions, or early marriage and excessive sexual indulgence, which consumes too much of the reproductive gland fluid. As a result, symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, neurasthenia, and infertile sperm will follow one after another. Such a husband will inevitably look withered and age prematurely. Not only in his livelihood or in the struggle to protect his family will he be in a miserable position. Wives are mostly competitive. When she sees that her husband is so useless, how can she not resent him in her heart? As for married life, if the husband shows weakness and incompetence, or even complete impotence, how heartbroken and distraught will she be! This may lead to domineering behavior, seeking a way out by eloping with others, or righteously suing her husband for divorce, which is commonplace in today's society!

Why should a true man be abandoned by women and become a sinner in love? In today's era of advanced medicine, even if one unfortunately suffers from the above symptoms, seeking treatment is not difficult. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductin" is the most effective treatment. This preparation is based on the principle of reproductive gland endocrine supplementation therapy, extracted from the reproductive glands of strong animals such as gorillas, sea dogs, bears, and deer, and reproduced using scientific methods. Therefore, it is of precious quality and great efficacy, surpassing any other endocrine preparation. After taking it, it can generate sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within one day and night. Continuing to take it for half a month can further promote development and regulate metabolism, and all the above symptoms can be completely cured. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Himi-Toth Spermatocidal Pills" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect will be rapid!

Patient Chen Zhongbai, 26 years old, from Anhui Province, works in agriculture. Last year, he came to Shanghai to escape the war and suffered from severe premature ejaculation and impotence, as well as nocturnal emissions. His wife, Ms. Li, was very dissatisfied and intended to file for divorce. I carefully diagnosed and treated him, and prescribed a large amount of "Reproductin" and "Himi-Toth Spermatocidal Pills" to be taken together. As a result, the nocturnal emissions stopped after one week. In less than a month, he completely regained his perfect health. As a result, the love between the couple deepened, and the past unpleasantness was swept away.

Beauty and Health

### Scientific Remedies for Sagging Breasts

— American MD Yao Chongpei

Buying cosmetics for beauty,
Is the most foolish waste!
Know that modern women,
Need plump breasts and hips to be dazzling.

If a woman spares no effort to buy cosmetics to decorate herself in order to win praise from people, then that is the most foolish and wasteful thing. Know that in today's society, anyone with a little medical knowledge and a modern perspective knows that whether a woman is beautiful or not is entirely determined by whether her body is healthy. In other words, whether she has high and firm breasts, plump hips, and moist and firm muscles. If these three cannot meet the standards and are sagging, thin, and withered, then even if you pour dozens of yuan of expensive perfume and powder on your body, it will not be enough for modern men to even glance at. If you encounter frugal and outspoken men, they may even sarcastically mock you as a female parasite who only knows how to consume and not produce! In this case, if you are a married woman, your husband will naturally only hate you and not be happy! If you are an unmarried girl, who would dare to marry you, a wife who has lost her health and beauty and is not worth taking? Therefore, the future and fate of such women are unimaginably tragic! To seek rescue, one can only rely on science. According to the years of experimental reports from world-renowned gynecologist Kang Tuoxiu and French beauty master Tang Posheng, it is unanimously recognized that taking the ovary preparation for women

"Reproductin" is the most effective treatment. The main reason for sagging breasts and thin hips is that the function of the reproductive gland ovary is destroyed by masturbation, chest binding, irregular menstruation, and leucorrhea, which affects the metabolism. Therefore, if you take female "Reproductin" made from the secretion of the ovaries of male animals at this time, it can nourish the ovarian function, promote metabolism, and regulate menstruation within one day and night after taking it. Continuing to take it will not only make sagging breasts tall and firm, but also make hips plump, muscles smooth, and cheeks rosy, transforming ugliness into beauty.

### Physiological and Pathological Differentiation of Nocturnal Emissions

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Many young people experience occasional physiological ejaculation and develop severe psychological terror, leading to insomnia and palpitations, which is too unfair! Know that there is a difference between physiological and pathological nocturnal emissions: A healthy young man who is physiologically mature and unmarried, or married and separated from his beloved wife, may experience one or two nocturnal emissions within one or two months due to the excessive abundance of seminal fluid produced physiologically. If there is no feeling of fatigue or dizziness after the emission, then this must be a physiological overflow and does not harm health at all, so there is no need to worry! If a young man with a history of masturbation or early marriage and sexual indulgence has damaged his sexual nerves and loosened his sperm gate, resulting in two or three or more emissions per month, and feels tired and brain-swollen after the emission, then this must be pathological nocturnal emission. As for those who have prolonged nocturnal emissions, or congenital weakness, post-illness imbalance, or excessive worry, and may even have a small amount of semen leaking out during the day, this is the most dangerous sperm leakage.

Pathological nocturnal emissions and sperm leakage must not be tolerated. Treating it early can save vitality, but if the leakage is prolonged until the essence is exhausted, then hundreds of diseases will arise, the most common being brain decay, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, impotence, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and so on. Such young people will not be able to continue their studies at school or perform their duties happily at work, so their future is bleak! At the same time, they will be dissatisfied with their wives in their married life, and all kinds of tragedies will occur in the family as a result, so their lifelong happiness will be lost! However, in today's era of advanced medicine, treating nocturnal emissions is not difficult. The most effective treatment is to take "Himi-Toth Spermatocidal Pills," which can consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves, and nocturnal emissions can be stopped immediately that night. If you already have the above symptoms, you must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continuing to take it for half a month will surely cure all the symptoms. If the patient can come to this clinic for electrotherapy and injections, then a cure can be guaranteed.

### Why is Acute Leukorrhea Easy to Treat?

Why is acute leukorrhea easy to cure? This question is not difficult to answer. It is because, in acute gonorrhea, the gonococci gather in the anterior urethra and have not yet spread internally, so effective treatment can wipe them out in one fell swoop, without causing hundreds of symptoms due to entering the posterior urethra. Once the gonococci enter the deep part and hundreds of symptoms occur, dealing with the gonococci becomes very difficult, requiring a longer period of treatment and a relatively large amount of money. It also requires experienced and responsible doctors to achieve the goal of a complete cure. If the treatment is not effective, it will only get worse and eventually become incurable.

Three to five days to about a week after visiting a prostitute, the prodromal period of gonorrhea will appear. That is, burning and stinging pain in the urethra, uncomfortable urination, and turbid fluid flowing out. After that, these symptoms will worsen, the burning pain during urination will be more severe, and pus and blood will flow out. At this time, the urethral mucosa has been frequently ulcerated due to inflammation and swelling, so using any instrument to wash the urethra at this time can easily break the deep layer of the mucosa and force the poison inward. It will not only fail to heal quickly, but will also cause complications.

The most reliable method that is appreciated by doctors all over the world is to use autogenous vaccine for injection and German filtration and leveling electrotherapy. In this way, one side increases the patient's resistance and reduces inflammation and swelling, and the other side can directly burn and kill the gonococci through heat penetration. Filtering and clearing the gonococci can completely cure the disease within three to five days and never recur. It is infallible.

Transportation Weekly

### Transportation Briefs

— Su

(1) Since the occurrence of the Great Jin incident, Tanggu Station has suddenly become deserted. Between the Taikoo or Yihua Wharf in Tanggu and the Tanggu Railway Station (a distance of several miles), there are currently no rickshaws available due to environmental reasons, and there are very few porters. The asking price for transporting luggage and other items is unusually expensive. At the same time, the inspection in Tanggu is very strict. Passengers who want to go to Tianjin or pass through Tanggu to Beiping should try to reduce the amount of luggage they carry as much as possible, which can not only save travel expenses but also avoid a lot of trouble on the way.

(2) Those who want to go to Hunan and Guangxi should, according to the latest transportation situation, take the route via Haiphong and then through Hanoi, Lang Son, Longzhou, and other places. It is reported that a telegram from Dong Dang, Vietnam, stated that a mountain torrent recently broke out between Lang Son and Dong Dang, so the Langlong Highway is also temporarily suspended. It is found that this mountain torrent is quite large and may not recede completely within a few days. All passengers going to Hunan and Guangxi, please pay attention to this.

(3) The Huangguoshu Station of the Huangping section of the Southwest Highway is located near Zhenning County, Guizhou Province, between Anshun and Annam. There are waterfalls of ten thousand feet that rush into view. Stopping to see them is a spectacular sight and is known as one of the famous scenic spots in Guizhou Province. The China Travel Service, in view of this, is actively preparing to set up the Huangguoshu Dining Hall so that passengers can enjoy the scenery while dining. The dining hall has now been completely decorated and officially opened on July 1st. The location is adjacent to the waterfall, and the dining hall can accommodate 32 people at the same time. The set meals are divided into two types, 0.5 and 0.2 yuan. It is found that the dining hall is the first-day dining station from Kunming to Guiyang and the third-day dining station from Guiyang to Kunming. All passengers traveling between Kunming and Guiyang will have the opportunity to enjoy the great view of the waterfall in the dust, which is also an excellent opportunity.

### Transportation in Neijiang

— Bao

Neijiang is the center of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, and its position is extremely important. Fifty kilometers from Neijiang is Ziliujing, the largest salt field in China (now known as Zigong City), so it has now been transformed into an important transportation hub. Because Neijiang is the midpoint of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and Highway, traffic has been frequent recently, and the transportation authorities are doing their best to dredge the water and land transportation.

There are two highways starting from Neijiang: one is the Neijing Highway, which goes from Neijiang to Ziliujing, 50 kilometers long, built by the Sichuan-Kang Salt Affairs Administration, and is now operated by the Yuantong Automobile Company, which is invested by merchants. The bus station is outside the West Gate of Neijiang. The route goes from Neijiang through Baima Temple, Sanduo Village, to Ziliujing, which takes two and a half hours for large vehicles. Upstream, it can reach Fushun and Weiyuan. Although there are no buses yet, it can be reached by rickshaw or sedan.

The fare from Neijiang to Ziliujing is 2.4 yuan per person for ordinary buses, and 18 yuan for a small chartered car with six seats. However, there are now many passengers, and you must register in advance to get a ticket. There are two shifts every day, the morning shift at 7:00 in the morning and the afternoon shift at 2:00 in the afternoon. The second route is the Lulong Highway, which is a section of the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway, 102 kilometers long, and Neijiang is now the starting point. The journey from Neijiang to Luzhou via Longchang takes five hours, and the fare for passenger cars is 5.65 yuan per person. It departs from Neijiang at 7:00 every morning.

After arriving in Luzhou from Neijiang, you can take a boat upstream to Chongqing, which takes two and a half days, currently operated by small steamers, including Changgang, Huadong, Minyou, Jingde, and other boats. The ticket for the economy class is 4 yuan per person, and the ticket for the cabin is 8 yuan per person. Downstream from Luzhou can reach Xufu, which takes one day by water, and the fare is 1 yuan per person. This route extends the money between Chu, Yu, and Lu. From Xufu by waterway, you can also reach Jiading. Currently, only Minjue operates on this route. When the water level rises in the future, there will be more ships.

### Continued Use for Studying in the United States

— Xing

After Arriving in the United States

Before the ship arrives in port and disembarks, you must go through the Immigration Bureau for questioning. First- and second-class passengers are not very troublesome; the so-called doctor's examination is mostly just a formality. When answering questions, the language should be clear and simple, and do not be smart and talk endlessly. The tone should not be too British, because Americans value their national language very much. At the same time, you must also present your passport, Certificate No. 6, and the admission letter or telegram from the American school. The questions are usually very simple, but they ask about family status, study plans in the United States, etc. After the Immigration Bureau allows entry, you can collect your luggage, go through customs inspection, and then disembark. Luggage is usually arranged according to the first letter of the passenger's surname. You can find your own luggage and a customs officer will come to inspect it. Customs officers are also not very picky about inspecting students' luggage. The most important things are jewelry, decorations, tea, cigarettes, etc. All clothes and books that you usually use are not taxed, but if a man brings women's clothing or a woman brings men's clothing, unless they are traveling married couples, they will all be taxed. If there are such gifts for others or things that others have asked you to bring, you can ask male and female friends traveling with you to bring them ashore to avoid trouble. As for fresh fruits, plants, etc., they are absolutely forbidden to be brought ashore.

(1) On-Shore Visits Every autumn, a large number of students go to the United States to study. The Chinese consulates in San Francisco and Seattle, overseas Chinese, and other Chinese and Western organizations often hold welcome parties. Group visits are relatively easy. If there are no large groups of students traveling together, so that no one receives you when you arrive in the United States, and you are not familiar with the situation in the United States, sightseeing will naturally be a bit difficult, but if you find out the route clearly, you can also go by yourself. If you disembark in San Francisco, you can visit the Expo, Chinatown, Golden Gate Park, Golden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge, and the University of California. You can also take a train to Los Angeles, Hollywood, and other places for a tour. For accommodation, you can stay at the Chinese YMCA Hostel. If you land in Seattle, you can visit Chinatown and the University of Washington. For accommodation, you can stay at Mars' Hotel, which specializes in receiving Chinese people, and it is very convenient for Chinese students to patronize.

(2) Taking the Train (or Long-Distance Bus) Except for a few students who want to take a bus to the west, central, and eastern parts to study, representatives from various railway companies will board the ship to solicit business before the ship docks. If you are willing to purchase train tickets from the China Travel Service before going abroad, you will receive special care when you arrive in the United States. If you plan to stop in port for sightseeing, you can negotiate a time with them and ask them to book a seat for you (because you may not be able to get a seat if you book at the last minute). If there are many people, it is best to buy tickets from the same company in advance, so that it will be easier for everyone to take care of each other when you arrive at your destination, regardless of whether there are friends picking you up. There are two railway companies running eastward from San Francisco: Santa Fe and Southern Pacific. Those running eastward from Seattle have Northern Pacific, Great Northern, and Chicago-Milwaukee-St. Paul Railway companies. Each company has its own strengths. No matter which company you take the train, you can enjoy various different scenery along the way. Most students studying in the United States take the coach or Tourist Class, which is more economical. In addition, there are sightseeing cars and first-class cars, but the prices are too high, and it seems too extravagant for students to take them. The fare for coach and tourist class from San Francisco and Seattle to Chicago is US$49, plus berth fee.

### Travel Q & A

Answer to Yao Ji-bao, Sun Lin-jun, Jiang Zu-heng, Chen Yu, Li Wen, Sun Bing, Ye Zhaozhang, Shen Jun, Chuan Dacheng, Xu Ziyu, Zhang Youan, Gongsun Wei, Fang Zhijun, Huang Heming: 1. Anyone wishing to travel to the interior via Ningbo must obtain a boarding guarantee from the shipping company and have it guaranteed by a reputable shop here before purchasing a ticket. See issue 19 of this publication for details. There are no special procedures for disembarking in Ningbo; only the verification of official documents is required. It is advisable to bring as little luggage as possible, and cameras are not allowed. 2. Those going to Lishui can take a steamer to Xikou after arriving in Yong, then follow the highway through Xinchang, Shengxian, Dongyang, and Yongkang to reach their destination. The journey takes more than a day, and the travel expenses are about 16 yuan. 3. The transportation situation from Ningbo to Yanping, Fujian, is described in detail in issue 19 of this publication; please refer to that article. 4. From Ningbo to Huangyan, because the coastal highway is no longer smooth, it is better to take a boat from Yong to Baiguan, then follow the highway through Shengxian, Xinchang, Tiantai, and Linhai. The journey takes two days, and the travel expenses are more than ten yuan. 5. To go to Yuqian, you can transfer to Jinhua after arriving in Yong, then take a train to Lanxi. The transportation situation between Lanxi and Yuqian is unknown. If you want to be safe, you must either go via Anhui or take a train from Shanghai to Hangzhou, then take a highway through Lin'an to reach Yuqian. However, you must have a travel permit before you can set off. 6. To get to Huizhou in Anhui, you can go via Ningbo to Jinhua, then take a train to Lanxi and then take a highway to Huizhou. The highway travel expenses from Jinhua to Huizhou are about ten yuan, and the journey takes one day. When traveling in the interior, identity documents are essential. 7. To get from Ningbo to Zhuji, you can first go to Xikou, then follow the highway through Xinchang and Shengxian to reach Zhuji. The travel expenses are 18 yuan.

Answer to Ding Yinghou: 1. Passports can be applied for through the China Travel Service, but it takes more than three weeks to obtain. The official cabin fare from Shanghai to Haiphong is 112 yuan in national currency, the cabin fare is 82 yuan, and the steerage fare is 44 yuan. Applying for a passport in Hong Kong in person only takes one week. 2. It is more economical to carry luggage with you. If you transport it separately, the cost of transportation by boat and car is quite high. If you bring a lot of daily necessities, you must pay taxes according to regulations. 3. Taking the train from Haiphong to Kunming takes one night for the express train and three or four days for the slow train. The fares are the same for express and slow trains: 53 Vietnamese dollars for second class, 30 dollars and 55 cents for third class, and 10 dollars and 65 cents for fourth class. (One Vietnamese dollar is about 3.2 yuan in national currency.)

Answer to Wang Jun: 1. There are no difficulties in bringing Western books on civil engineering when arriving in the defense zone, but the content must be checked.

Answer to Dong Deji: 1. To study in Moscow, Soviet Union, it was originally more economical to go via Vladivostok and then the Siberian Railway. However, this route has been suspended since the war. If you go via Dalian, it is very inconvenient for Chinese travelers. Therefore, it is better to take a ship from Shanghai to London (French Post Office third class 46 pounds), then transfer from London to Lenin Village in the Soviet Union (third class US$40). From Lenin Village, you can take a train to Moscow (third class hard seat 3 pounds per person). The whole journey takes 40 days. 2. Passports can be handled by the China Travel Service, and then the British and French consulates can be asked to add transit visas, and then the Soviet Embassy in China can be asked to add entry visas. 3. The cost of living in Moscow is quite affordable, but recently the exchange rate has skyrocketed. Studying abroad with national currency seems to be too expensive.

Answer to Sun Shijie: 1. To go from Shanghai to Xi'an and Lanzhou, you can first take a boat from Shanghai to Haiphong, then take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming, then follow the highway through Guiyang, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Qingyuan to reach Neian. The minimum travel expenses for the whole journey are more than 230 yuan in national currency. There are Xilan Highway buses from Xi'an to Lanzhou, and the fare is 31.5 yuan. 2. Xi'an and Lanzhou both have China Travel Service hostels. 3. Cameras cannot be carried when traveling in the interior.

Answer to Zhao Chong: 1. To go to Dihua, Xinjiang, you can follow the Lanxing Highway from Lanzhou to Xingxing Gorge after arriving in Lanzhou. The fare is 56.7 yuan. There is also a highway from Xingxing Gorge to Dihua, but the fare is unknown.

### A Respectful Announcement to Readers

— Deng Bingquan

The publication of this journal has reached its twentieth issue today. Within this short period of time, it has adapted to the needs of the times by promptly publishing information on inland transportation, including highways, railways, airlines, and ship routes. It has exhausted its knowledge to be as detailed as possible, striving for simplicity in writing and accuracy in content. The Shenbao and the China Travel Service share the same goal of serving society, seeking mutual support and cooperation, and we hope to make a significant contribution to readers during this extraordinary period.

My colleagues have opened a "Q & A" column to answer readers' questions about travel. We are grateful for your support, and inquiries have poured in. Each issue receives more than a hundred inquiries. Counting twenty issues, we have received no less than three thousand letters. My colleagues have numbered and answered them, and the ones published in this journal are too numerous to mention. From this, we can see the readers' strong support, and the publication of this journal by this newspaper and our agency is indeed worthwhile.

Now, this journal will take a temporary break from readers starting with this issue. The biggest reason is that transportation information changes rapidly. The weekly publication of this journal seems too slow. In order to provide better service, we plan to publish transportation information in this newspaper at any time in the future, so that the information obtained today can be published in the newspaper tomorrow, thus avoiding backlog, and readers can be the first to know.

Those who want to understand travel-related issues can always inquire with our agency by telephone or letter, and we will answer them with all our knowledge. We hope you will pay attention to this.

### Diplomatic History of Burma (2)

King Xifa of Burma sent an envoy with gifts, who has arrived in Lengjiang City. An order was given to prepare a ship to welcome him, which sailed for seven days before reaching the capital. When the French envoy landed, the king displayed the splendor of his military might with two rows of Pixiu and Mandarin ducks and egrets standing upright, which was truly dazzling. Then, the French envoy rode an elephant into the capital of the king. As soon as he dismounted from his palanquin, he stayed briefly in his luggage. The capital of the King of Burma is like a pigpen, with a circumference of only one li. Inside the city are magnificent palaces and towers. Outside the city, there is another city, which is twice as large as the royal city. There is also an outer city wall outside the city. There are more than 300 concubines in the palace, with a tower every five steps and a pavilion every ten steps, with pine clouds and carved windows, which are exceptionally brilliant. Outside the palace, there is an imperial garden with deer and fish in the ponds for entertainment. There is also a parliament hall and a temple. As for the Ministry of Justice, the White Elephant Office, the Silver Mint, and the Secret Artillery Bureau, all have the serene and solemn scenery of swaying trees. The walls of the royal city are made of teak. The city has four gates, but only those who are noble and of Chinese descent are allowed to enter and exit the North Gate. The king had previously set up a reception hall for the imperial envoy at the East Gate, the interior of which was very elegant. When the French envoy arrived, the king specially sent personnel to take care of him and hired a French chef to prepare meals. The imperial envoy's reception hall was guarded by soldiers, but these soldiers were not only useless for protection but also prone to theft. Whenever the imperial envoy went in or out, a soldier would always sneak behind him. The French envoy stayed for two and a half months before he was able to see the King of Burma. When he reached the inner hall, the French envoy took off his shoes and entered according to his country's customs, but he did not wear a crown. The king was furious and scolded the guide severely. The French envoy sat on a mat, tightly covering his feet, as it was not customary for the king to see his feet. The king's clothes were also very ordinary, but the diamonds were strung together like beads. After the French envoy respectfully presented the gifts, he read the national letter in one breath. When discussing peace, their opinions did not agree, because the French envoy had clauses such as allowing the establishment of consuls, companies, and the manufacture of various crafts, which the King of Burma was unwilling to allow.

### Children's Responsibility in High Prices

— Yin

Children, since you are also a member of society, you must not be indifferent to all the problems that occur in society. Although sometimes you don't feel it personally, everything is related to you to some extent. Let's talk about the current price increases in various industries. The families of salaried people are the most affected. Fathers and brothers who used to earn fifty yuan a month can only afford the same as they used to with thirty yuan a month due to the high prices. They used to buy half a dollar's worth of vegetables a day, but now they can only get two and a half cents worth of things. This makes the vegetables seem less, and maybe you can't often eat the fish, meat, shrimp, and crabs that you like. Because prices are high, expenses are high, but income does not increase. Therefore, parents used to often buy you toys and candy to eat, but now, fixed expenses also have to be tightened. The toys you love to play with and the candy you love to eat naturally can't be bought for you often. Watermelons, popsicles, soda, and fruit juice in the summer... these are not necessary cold drinks, although they are very seasonal, but for the sake of frugality, maybe you haven't even tasted them once. Children, are you complaining about your parents because of this? Are you dissatisfied because the vegetables are not to your liking on weekdays?

There are many reasons for such high prices: imported goods are skyrocketing due to foreign exchange tightening, many goods are increasing in price due to rising raw material prices, some are hoarding goods due to the control of a certain party, and there are even unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating prices, taking advantage of the fire. We have no power to stabilize prices, but how to deal with this situation, in addition to our parents, children themselves also have a considerable responsibility. First, we must strictly implement frugality. When spending a penny, we must consider again and again whether the expenditure of this penny is necessary. Moreover, at present, due to the lack of copper coins, all things have a minimum price of one cent. Then, ten one cents are one dime, and the accumulation of small amounts has a big impact. Second, if you think a certain thing is necessary to buy, be determined to use domestic goods. For example, when buying toys, although there are certain goods that are cheap, if they are not domestic goods, it is better not to buy them. This period is the best opportunity to promote domestic goods. Third, investigate the reasons for the price increase of a certain product. On the one hand, it allows us to understand the raw materials and processes of product manufacturing, increase our knowledge of industry and commerce, and on the other hand, we can supervise merchants to see if they are speculating. If it is indeed an unscrupulous merchant taking advantage of the fire, then I should fulfill the responsibility of persuading and warning them. We are the small masters of the era and should take on the responsibility of small masters.

Children, our knowledge and abilities are valuable only when they are obtained from practical experience, and this is precisely the opportunity for us to gain practical experience!

### How Are Elephants Captured?

— Wisdom

Children: Have you ever seen a circus performance? Where did the many elephants in the circus come from? They were bought from people who specialize in catching elephants. So how do people who specialize in catching elephants catch them? Below are some methods of how to catch elephants:

These elephants are mostly captured when they are very large, because elephants need to go through a long period of time to grow. Therefore, catching a large grown elephant is more cost-effective than raising a small elephant.

Wild elephants often appear in the jungles of tropical regions such as Asia and Africa. They often travel in groups. A group is made of 20 or 30 elephants, and sometimes there can be up to more than 100 elephants. The elephant herds are often led by an elephant who knows where to get food and drinks. The leading elephant is often a female elephant.

Catching wild elephants is a very difficult task. Elephant catchers often use trained elephants to help them. They build a huge and strong fence made of wood that is a foot thick and more than ten feet long, and then covered with green bark or vines. Leave one or two gaps as entrances. These doors should be designed so that the elephant herds can be closed immediately after being driven into the fence.

After the fence is built, the elephant catchers can wait for the elephants to come. When a herd of elephants approaches the fence, a large group of people surrounds them, holding torches and shaking and shouting as much as possible to drive the elephant herd into the fence. After all the elephants have entered, the fence door is immediately closed. The elephants are very strong. If they hit the fence, the fence must collapse. So when an elephant hits the fence, the elephant catchers use torches and other things to scare it back. After some time, these elephants no longer want to escape. At this time, the elephant catchers release a batch of trained elephants. These trained elephants are complete "elephant traitors." They will lure and monitor the wild elephants. The elephant catchers also quietly walk into the fence and tie up the wild elephants one by one with strong ropes. These wild elephants were captured. After a considerable period of training, they can be sold: and they have also become "elephant traitors" to lure other wild elephants?

### Barbaric Customs

— Bai Zheng

— Ming'er's Unforgettable Record No. 27 —

A group of refugees spent seven or eight days before stepping into the mountains of Anhui. Ming'er gradually became accustomed to the boring life on the boat, and he ate more than usual. Three bowls of rice were nothing to him. It was really strange that although they had tasted the bitterness of being refugees, spending these days on the boat had made Ming'er fatter. It was probably because he ate more and used less brainpower, living a pig-like life.

When the sun set in the west and the sky was not yet dark, the Jiangshan boat docked on the shore. "What place is this?" "Shendu," the boatman replied casually. Ming'er saw that it was still early and felt bored sitting in the cabin. It would be better to go ashore and take a walk. Moreover, the boat was staying here overnight, so he was not afraid of the boatman urging him. Ming'er mumbled as he went ashore. "What are the differences between Anhui and Zhejiang?" His older brother standing on the bow of the boat heard these words.

"Mingdi, look, the hills here have been fully utilized by the farmers of Anhui. One row of bean fields after another is arranged on the mountains. The fields are full of broad beans. From this, we can see that the terrain of Anhui is mountainous. Otherwise, who would be happy to go to the mountains to farm? This is because there is too little arable land on the plains. They have to be forced to go to the mountains to farm in order to maintain their lives. The Zhejiang we passed through has more plains, so they no longer use the mountains. Isn't this the difference between Anhui and Zhejiang? It can be seen that knowledge is available everywhere, as long as you carefully search for it, and the living knowledge you find is much more useful than the limited dead knowledge in books, do you think that's right?" His older brother said this. His mother called him to go ashore with him to take care of his younger brother.

As soon as the two of them set foot on the shore, the first thing that made them feel different was that there were latrines everywhere. The style of each latrine was almost the same, with a very unified spirit. Each one was covered with a pavilion that looked like a policeman's stand, but without a bottom. A stench filled the area around it, which was its sphere of influence. There were truly small pits every three steps and large pits every five steps. The custom of foot binding was also very popular here. Ming'er almost laughed out loud when he saw it. Just imagine: the heads of girls who are only about ten years old have a heavy, drooping bun that occupies one-third of the entire head. Dragging such a large sideburn behind the girl's small head, is it considered beautiful? They also bind their feet, making them small and exquisite (?). When they walk, they move their lotus steps gently, how graceful! Large buns and small feet, which local people at this time think are beautiful. Each of them is holding a bamboo basket in both hands, hidden in a cloth skirt, walking back and forth on the street. (Because it was late autumn, the climate there was already very cold. The bamboo basket contained charcoal for warmth, and the local people called it a "baking basket.") This strange behavior could not help but make Ming'er laugh. But there was a different feeling in his older brother's eyes, and he gently said to his younger brother: "You're still laughing, I can almost cry. It's precisely the time when their bodies are developing, but they are forcibly turning them into this strange appearance, making them have the old age of old people, and their deformed development turns into adults. How can the children they give birth to be strong? So I think it's better to let them go and be happy, don't harm future generations. This barbaric custom still exists in modern times, no wonder China has the nickname of 'Sick Man of East Asia.'" Ming'er's older brother said a lot, and Ming'er felt it was very right. The two of them didn't want to watch any longer, so they hurriedly returned to the boat.

That night, the sound of the rapids near the Jiangshan boat was gurgling, as if it was complaining for the group of poor girls, but what was the use? "I must reform this barbaric custom in the future!" Ming'er murmured in the dark cabin.

### Homemade Stationery Printing Machine

— Wang Zufu

Printing machine. Do you often hear it in your ears? You also often see its works. The test papers, holiday slips, and leave slips in schools are probably all printed by printing machines. Most schools have one or two in stock. Because its cost is very low and it is very convenient, it is very common.

Now I will introduce to you children how to make a small printing machine. It only costs a few cents to make one yourself. Now I will write the materials, tools, construction method, and usage below.

Materials: One white wax candle, three cigarette cans, one piece of plywood or thick paper seven inches long and five inches wide, three picture nails, a few large sheets of paper, and one lead wire.

Tools: Alcohol lamp, old western knife, scissors, fountain pen (the nib must be G-shaped)

Construction Method: Wax paper, put the alcohol lamp (the alcohol lamp can be made with a glue bottle) in the cigarette can, and cover it with another one. A hole needs to be opened on the side to put a little candle oil on it. On the bottom of the cigarette can, slightly soak a large sheet of paper in the candle oil, and the wax will be evenly spread on the paper. Then change to another place so that the candle oil is completely applied. After cooling, cut it into six inches long and three and a half inches wide. (See Figure 1)

Steel Plate: Cut the cigarette can into a flat piece of lead skin. The size is optional. Use an old western knife to draw a cross like (Figure 2).

Ink Stick: Cut a three-inch-long piece of wax candle, remove the wick in the middle, and thread the lead wire through the hole. Then pliers it into the shape of (Figure 3).

Ink: After concentrating the ink, add a little paste and grind it again. It must not be too thick.

Construction Method

Write the words you need on the wax paper with a fountain pen on the steel plate. Cover a sheet of white newspaper on top, the same size as the wax paper. Use picture nails to firmly press the two papers on the plywood or thick paper. Place a few smaller sheets of white paper under the wax paper. (See Figure 4) The work department is over, just apply oil and wait for printing.

Usage: Put a little thick ink on the newspaper above the wax paper. After applying it, put the paper down, and then apply a thin layer of ink on it. Push the ink stick forward (need weight). Finally, take up the newspaper and wax paper together: the white paper below will be printed with very clear black characters. Then put it down and print the second sheet. Just push it again on the newspaper above. After printing a few sheets, add some ink again. One sheet of paper can print dozens of sheets.

Reason: Why add paste to the black? Because ink is easy to dissolve, so adding paste will make it sticky, so it will not dissolve.

Although this kind of small craft is not widely used, it is quite interesting. I hope you children will follow the above methods and do further research when trying it.

### Animal Realm (10) (1)

— Xin Qing

So, those animals all gathered around, forming a large circle, with Peng Qi in the center. Old Man Frog, who lived in the nearby ditch, was pushed forward by Fork Grandpa to take on the job of lookout. This Old Man Frog had particularly large eyes, so he was perfectly suited for the lookout post. He maintained a very calm and cautious demeanor. During Peng Qi's trial, Old Man Frog kept shouting, "Gak, gak, gak!" seemingly as a form of warning.

At that moment, the lion, like a judge, opened its mouth and asked, "What is the matter for which you accuse this sinner?"

Upon hearing these words, everyone looked around, hoping to push the Titmouse forward to explain everything. But, just like those humans who only know how to stir up trouble but refuse to take responsibility, it had taken advantage of the chaotic and unsettled moment and flown away long ago. So, the other animals had to struggle to remember and recount all the accusations they had previously heard about Peng Qi.

"He abuses dogs, even throwing them into the water to drown them alive. When he catches cats, he tortures them to death –" Seeing them enumerate his crimes so concretely, Peng Qi was secretly shocked and quickly interrupted, "It was Le Fu who killed the cats—" Old Man Frog seemed to disagree with Peng Qi's words, suddenly shouting "Gak!" to prevent Peng Qi from continuing.

The lion, adopting the solemn attitude of a judge, issued a command: "Bring Le Fu here!" Immediately, a special envoy set off to summon Le Fu.

Just then, a beautiful rooster strutted forward and crowed loudly, "Ooh, ooh, ooh! Flap, flap, flap! (Sound of flapping wings) Since you are going to summon witnesses, you must summon one more. Ooh, ooh, ooh! No other rooster is allowed to speak while I am speaking. Do you know a young rogue who likes cockfighting and does evil? I know such a person, and his name is Xiao Tang. Bring him here and put him together with his good friend Peng Qi. We will tie heavy iron to their heels, have them kick each other back and forth, and pluck out their eyeballs. This is a very rare and good game. All games are interesting, and we must encourage them from the sidelines. Ooh, ooh, ooh!" As he spoke, he flapped his wings.

Just as the rooster raised his toes, ready to crow again, they suddenly heard a series of footsteps and the clanging of a collar chain. It turned out that the鬃毛dog Le Fu had already clumsily walked into their circle, twitching his short ears and stiff tail.

As soon as the lion saw him approach, it opened its mouth and said, "Mr. Le Fu, according to this criminal, you are the one who abused the raccoons, not—"

Le Fu jumped around wildly, barking, "Woof, woof, woof! Whose fault is this? Woof, woof, woof! Who taught me to do it? Woof, woof! It was that bad kid, Peng Qi, woof, woof! I wish I could grab his spine and throw him around like a madman. Woof, woof, woof!"

Everyone was very excited by these words and clamored for a moment. Then they heard the crowd shouting, "Keep order! Keep order!" And then all around was quiet.

Under the lion's interrogation, Le Fu insisted that his behavior towards the cats was entirely due to the teaching and instigation of people like Peng Qi. Sometimes, in moments of frenzy, he didn't like cats, so it was inevitable that he would chase and harm them. But in fact, he had always been friendly to the cats in his own home. They were in the same kitchen, very harmonious, and even ate from the same plate, never arguing. He also admitted that it was in his nature to tear things, and that he liked to tear everything hairy. But he didn't necessarily have to insult hairy creatures; a hairy slipper or other furry objects would satisfy him.

Report on Livelihood

### National Goods Salesperson

— Yan

Due to unemployment and the pressure of life, and unable to find other suitable work, I was introduced by a friend to join the ×× National Goods Service Cooperative as a salesperson, with a deposit of "40 yuan at the limit". It was a gathering place for unemployed youth, a good opportunity for those transitioning to find employment. But the truth is undeniable: we, this group of unemployed youth, are struggling on the edge of starvation, and are tasting the hardships and pains of the human world!

Every day, at seven o'clock in the morning, we go to the cooperative to pick up goods, then everyone carries a rattan box or briefcase, and disperses, heading towards each person's "new road" aimlessly. In the lanes of residential households, or in shops that don't conflict with our business, and in public places that might allow us to peddle, we open the box and use words to move the hearts of customers. But we have a uniform price, we don't haggle with big customers, and we never allow bargaining. This price is about two to five cents cheaper per item than in stores with "genuine no bargaining". Because this national goods service cooperative for relieving unemployment has a history of more than two years, every customer knows our sales purpose well and has a good impression. Therefore, they either don't buy our goods, or if they buy, they will never treat us the same as ordinary merchants—there are often difficulties with bargaining.

The goods we sell are daily necessities, but limited to national products, divided into more than 40 kinds, including cosmetics, parts and hardware, parts and medicines, school supplies, celluloid products, etc. Because I started working at the cooperative in late spring, the goods I sell, in addition to toothbrushes, toothpaste, combs, cigarette holders, pencils, etc., are mostly summer necessities: cologne, prickly heat powder, Bagua Dan, Ren Dan... In short, our business also needs to adapt to the seasons.

The profit margin of our products is about two percent. Our division of profits with the cooperative is calculated at a ratio of two to eight, that is, the cooperative gets 20% and the members get 80%. Each member's monthly sales must be at least 60 yuan, otherwise their qualification will be revoked. However, if the first member's sales are only 60 yuan per month, how can the 80% of this meager profit be enough for a month's food expenses? Not to mention other living expenses! However, just this 60 yuan in sales is already very difficult, and it is even more difficult for a new member to earn this amount!

I have been doing this job for three months. In these three months, all day long—whether it is sunny or rainy, I am always running with other members, my legs and waist are very sore and painful. But the sales amount for the first month, after much effort, was only 60 yuan. The second and third months increased to 70 yuan, but that was only enough for food expenses. I know that I am running on a long journey of starvation every day, suffering from pain. As for the other thirty or forty long-term companions, their sales amount will not exceed 100 yuan at most. Under the current phenomenon of soaring prices, such a division of income makes it extremely difficult to maintain life. However, our spirit is happy, because no matter what, we are still earning our own living. After all, we are much more comforted in conscience than the "brokers" who sell inferior goods. We firmly believe that as long as we fight to the end, we will definitely have a bright future.

### A Flower in the Slum

— Qi Hua

"One Third of a Nation"

The theme of "A Flower in the Slum" is somewhat related to us on this isolated island. In the slums of New York, the houses are dilapidated, but the landlords don't pay attention. When a fire breaks out, a child named Joey falls from the fire escape and breaks his leg. Joey's sister, Mary, scolds the landlord Peter, and Peter agrees to demolish the old houses and build new ones. The film ends with a large-scale construction and the establishment of new residences.

In Shanghai, we often hear tragedies caused by dilapidated houses. However, the current problem is not here. Even if the landlord is willing to demolish the old houses, few tenants are willing to move. Do they want to bet their lives on the dilapidated houses? Of course not! The problem is whether the rents of the new houses after they are built are affordable for these old tenants. The playwright of "A Flower in the Slum" can bring together people from two completely different classes, and this intention is commendable, but he has overlooked the final condition. In addition to sympathy, we also need mutual help, especially at this time and place.

Regarding the performance, under the director's excellent skills, the whole play is very lively, compact, and especially the editing is brisk. To give a few examples: (1) After Joey is injured, he takes Peter's car to the hospital. The director uses three long shots to create a strong contrast between the slums and the magnificent residences. When Mary meets Peter, he also uses the same long shots to show the disparity between these two different classes. (2) After Joey breaks his leg and returns to the slum, his companions' playing football and bathing make Joey hate the old house because he has lost his freedom of movement. Others, such as Mary and others being happy that Peter is willing to demolish the old house and rebuild a new house, but Peter's sister is calculating the cost and arguing with Peter. And Peter kicks things over when he comes to the slum, while Mary can run around with the servants when she comes to Peter's house, etc. Although the whole play does not have big scenes and obvious climaxes, the proper use of this contrast technique is the success of the performance.

Sylvia Sidney's Mary and Fredric March's Peter both worked hard. What is even more worth mentioning is the child who played Joey, who has amazing achievements.

Readers who are tired of romance movies about urban young masters and young ladies, I recommend this "A Flower in the Slum" to you.

### Biographical Sketches of Female Storytellers

— Shen You

Now, excerpts are as follows:

Kong Zhiye, maiden name Geng Geng, is a female Suzhou storyteller. At the age of seventeen or eighteen, with unparalleled beauty and a very solitary and pure nature, she must be invited in many ways before she slowly comes. If there is something that offends her, she will remain silent all day long... Yan Sheng of Maoyuan, Shen Cun... recognized Kong Zhi during a banquet, her demeanor was dignified, and she had no flattering attitude at all. Sheng secretly thought that most of the people in the academy were dissolute, but he did not expect that there would be such a stable person, and he felt quite pity... After a long period of intimacy, they agreed to marry, although it was not as unrestrained, it was even more intimate than eyebrow painting. Sheng lived by the river, and one day, he leaned on the railing and gazed. Suddenly, he saw a painted boat parked next to the rocks, with a girl in it, vaguely visible, just a glance, and her beauty was unparalleled, even better than Kong Zhi. He stared at her for a long time, and the girl opened the window to peek. When asked, she said that she was a schoolgirl named Shu Qing, the daughter of a boatman, and her father had gone to Huai Shang and had not returned... She also said that she was willing to serve him... Sheng nodded, and then gradually became distant from Kong Zhi. Kong also suspected that he had another woman, and glimpsed a bracelet on his arm, knowing that it was an object from a lady's chamber, and asked where it came from, Sheng could not hide it... When Shu Qing's father returned, he was bribed with a large sum of money, and the matter was settled. With the auspicious day approaching, Sheng was restless day and night, planning for money and goods, and also had no time to see Kong Zhi, Kong Zhi hated him very much, and pretended to be going to Tiger Hill, hired a boat, went into the boat and looked at Shu Qing, who was standing tall and graceful, her eyebrows and eyes like paintings, and felt that she was not as good as her. She talked to her casually, and the two fell in love with each other... They understood each other, turned jealousy into love, and Shu wanted Kong to serve Yan Sheng together... When the day came, Sheng swept the courtyard and gathered his relatives and friends. Near noon, everyone said, "The bridal sedan chair is coming!" He went out to see, and it was Kong Zhi. Sheng said, "You must not have forgotten the oath we made by the incense burner..." Then another sedan chair arrived, and a woman came out with small steps, it was Shu Qing... At this time, Sheng stood there foolishly, his wife was shocked, the two girls laughed silently, and the guests were all looking at each other in dismay, not knowing what was going on. Kong Zhi had already abandoned her career and hid in Shu Qing's boat. On this day, Sheng's family welcomed them with sedan chairs, first sending Kong to the sedan chair, and then Shu arrived later. Sheng's wife was virtuous, and the two girls were obedient and able to manage the affairs of the family. When they had time, Kong Zhi played the pipa, and Shu Qing sang boat songs, and they were very happy...

The various types of female storytellers are now briefly described. However, most of them were active before the tenth year of Guangxu (1884). After this, Peking opera rose, and storytelling was no longer popular with the audience. Therefore, in "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Lyrics" by Qingxi Yueyuan Ren Shou Louzhu, there is a sentence: "For the sake of loving to listen to Peking opera tunes, the pipa is replaced with the moon lute." The books published later, such as "Shanghai Games Illustrated" (1899), "Biographies of Shanghai Flowers" (1903), and "Miscellaneous Records of Shanghai Pleasure Trips" (1908), are not like the "Shanghai Pleasure Guide" and "Miscellaneous Records of Shanghai Courtesans" published before the third year of Guangxu (1877), which must have descriptions of "female storytellers".

"Female Storytellers" is divided into six chapters, about 80,000 words, and is published on alternating days with "After the Rain, the Sky is Clear", appropriately one chapter per month, and completed in six days. Now, because "Spring and Autumn" will reduce its size starting next month, the two long stories cannot be taken care of at the same time, so when "Female Storytellers" ends, it will also be temporarily suspended, and will be published in succession when the original state is restored in the future. We hereby apologize to the author and readers. Editor

### An Appeal from Low-Salaried Employees

— Ren An

Recently, foreign exchange has shrunk sharply, and all commodities have soared in price. The price of rice has also risen sharply to more than 20 yuan due to the manipulation of speculators. Although the Public Works Department has strictly enforced price limits, the upward trend has not been curbed. According to the statistics of the Public Works Department, the cost of living index in June has risen to 176.15; the wages of workers can only抵到the 56.77 of the 25th year. People living on this isolated island are all complaining, especially those who live on salaries. Therefore, companies, factories, banks, and shops mostly have plans to subsidize employees.

I am a small employee in the largest cultural institution in the country. Not only do we not have any subsidies, but our original salary of 32 yuan has been reduced by 10%. Because the actual salary is less than 30 yuan, (those below 30 yuan have already restored their original salary in April this year) so the difference is made up to 30 yuan. A family of three, after paying 10 yuan for rent, five斗of white rice, and one担of coal balls each month, only has six or seven yuan left. Undoubtedly, in addition to running on two legs every morning and evening, what fills our stomachs at noon is not fried dough sticks and pancakes, but陽春noodles plus one. Occasionally eating a bowl of汤面is already an exception. But this kind of minimum standard of living still cannot be maintained.

The long-awaited announcement of restoring the original salary and subsidizing low-salaried employees was finally posted the day before yesterday. The method is that starting in August, all salaries, large and small, will be restored to their original levels. At the same time, the bonus method will also be cancelled. Except for salaries below 20 yuan (originally reduced by 20%), and below 30 yuan (originally reduced by 30%), which have been restored to their original levels, special consideration will be given to adding a small amount. The current discount situation is written below:

(1) Original salary from 30 yuan to 50 yuan: 90% (originally reduced by 30%)

(2) Original salary from 50 yuan to 100 yuan: 80% (originally reduced by 40%)

(3) Original salary from 100 yuan to 400 yuan: 70% (originally reduced by 50%)

(4) Original salary from 400 yuan to 1000 yuan: 60% (originally reduced by 60%)

Looking at the above methods of restoring the original salary, those with high salaries can restore 40%; those with low salaries can only restore 10%. In other words, those with high salaries can restore up to 400 yuan, and those with low salaries can only restore up to 5 yuan. Moreover, in fact, low-salaried employees with salaries below 50 yuan not only did not get the restored 10%, but were instead exploited. Taking my salary of 32 yuan as an example, after restoring the original salary, on the surface, I get 2 yuan more each month, and 24 yuan more per year. However, the cancellation of the bonus method will cause you to lose about half a month's salary every half year, which is a loss of 32 yuan per year. This method is obviously inappropriate for the treatment of low-salaried employees. Now, we sincerely hope that the company authorities can have a method to compensate low-salaried employees, such as giving each person a subsidy of three to five yuan per month, or imitating the method of subsidizing employees of a certain large bookstore, using the price of rice as the standard for subsidies (see this magazine on the 26th). In short, it is necessary to maintain the minimum standard of living for low-salaried employees.

Random Notes on Entertainers

### Stage and Screen (Part 1)

— Xia Xia

—My Parental Home and Married Home

Editor's introduction: Xia Xia is a Beijing girl with a great talent for drama. She came to Shanghai three years ago and played the role of顧媽in the stage play "Sai Jinhua", which was a great success and made her famous at the time. Later, she moved to the film industry and also achieved many excellent results. In terms of literature, she is especially well-cultivated and can write her own scripts and also serve as a director. Recently, the Silver Union Drama Society performed the play "Deferred Debt Repayment", which was her debut work as a director. The Xinhua authorities value her talent, and it is said that she will be promoted to director. Her future is unlimited. She is truly a multi-talented and exceptional female entertainer who is different from the constant flow.

The stage is my parental home, and the screen is my married home. I remember that this magazine said that about me, and it also included some words of encouragement, saying something like, "A married daughter is like water that has been poured out. Although you have arrived at your married home, don't let down the education you received from your parental home." This metaphor is quite appropriate. I jumped from the stage to the screen, just like marrying from my parental home to my married home. However, I am not a married daughter who is like water that has been poured out, because until now, I have never completely forgotten my parental home. Although my whole heart and body have arrived at my married home, in reality, I am still standing between my parental home and my married home. I love my parental home, and I also love my married home. I don't want to leave my parental home to go to my married home, and I am reluctant to stay in my parental home and not go to my married home. In a word: the stage and the screen occupy the same position in my heart. I love and covet them equally, and I am willing to be a loyal and promising good daughter in both places. Here, I would like to talk about my past relationship with my parental home and my married home, the current situation, and my future hopes, in three sections: That was three years ago! I got my family's permission, left school, and came to Shanghai to engage in the shadow play life that I had longed for for many years. At this time, carrying a beautiful dream and this ardent hope, I jumped on the Pinghu through train. Although it took thirty or forty hours on the road, I didn't close my eyes for an hour or sleep for an hour. At that time, that kind of excitement and nervousness made it impossible for me to calm down. Looking back now, it's really funny and pitiful!

When I arrived in Shanghai, because I was unfamiliar with the place, I didn't have any relatives or friends, only a teacher who taught me in the north helped me. But he didn't have any deep connections with the film industry either, and all he could do was to brag and introduce me. Shanghai is so big, and there are so many talents. A girl like me, who is not surprising and still has a bit of northern bluntness, of course didn't attract people's attention. So, after working hard for several days, I didn't have any clues.

After ten days of wandering and anxiety, I couldn't eat well, I couldn't sleep peacefully, and my brain was almost empty. I couldn't think of a way, and I was just longing for the door of the shadow play circle. But, "Where there's a will, there's a way." That's right. Although I deeply felt that I had no way to turn to and no one to help me, I didn't lose heart, give up hope. When I was busy during the day and there were no results, in the quiet of the night, I lay on the bed and comforted myself, saying: "Wait! Although today has passed without hope, there is still tomorrow? Tomorrow may bring hope, who knows."

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Significance of a Ten-Minute Break Before the Main Act

That kind of deliberate expression that makes you angry is really difficult for even the largest person at Xiamen University to tolerate. Often, arguments in theaters (i.e., quarrels and fights) mostly start from this. There is also another layer: modern plays are different from before. In the past, there were at least three or four plays to listen to every day. Now, a lot of money is spent just to listen to the last play (i.e., the main act). Who knows how many hours of suffering have been endured. Just when you are about to concentrate on listening to the main act on stage, suddenly a group of people come, those who collect tickets collect tickets, those who want tea money want tea money, and others who have money in their hands and send money for clothes and hats keep bothering you. If you give less, of course they will argue. Even if you give a few more coins in order to avoid trouble and listen to the play peacefully, then they will treat you as a big shot, and those who bow and greet you will also ask you to rise higher. How can you listen to the play in this way? Moreover, every spring, many members of foreign tour groups flock to visit Ping. Many of them who love Chinese drama also often step into the dirty and narrow Chinese theaters. Not only are they similarly harassed by the above-mentioned problems, but they also see the strange sight of handkerchiefs flying all over the theater upstairs and downstairs. Therefore, some foreign guests with wicked tongues say that not only the actors on the Chinese stage can perform, but even the tea servants in the theater can fight.

In view of the above-mentioned bad situation, I decided to first order each garden to take a ten-minute break before the main act. The drums on the stage are stopped, and at the same time, the people offstage can take a pee, chat, and peddlers selling cigarettes, fruits, etc., can sell during this time. Those who collect tickets and tea money also take advantage of this time to get things done. Each garden is different in size, and the number of attendees is uncertain. Although it is nominally a ten-minute break, in fact, everything is collected and counted. The tea servants are also limited by time, so they don't dare to demand too much. When all the matters in the front stage are completed, the main act continues to take the stage. The actors concentrate and exert themselves, and the audience concentrates on the stage. With order restored, the whole theater is naturally quiet. The performers don't waste their energy, and the customers' ticket prices are not wasted either. This is the meaning of the suggestion to take a ten-minute break before the main act at that time. (70)

### Writing a Good Script

— Feng

A senior Hollywood director once said that a good film script must have the following elements: (1) the plot must be tense, (2) the dialogue should be humorous, (3) the meaning should be implicit, (4) it should be sensual, but not vulgar or too revealing, (5) there should be a description of aristocratic life. Based on the above, we have written a script. This script not only satisfies the above conditions, but is also very short and concise. If you don't believe me, look at the following: "The Duchess laughed and said, 'Your Majesty, don't pull my leg like that.'" (Excerpted from "Analects" Two Flower Column)

### Wild Grasses and Idle Flowers

— A Literary Person

— Regarding the Charity Photo Exhibition of Stars

At the current charity photo exhibition of stars, the photo of Yuan Meiyun taken by NurnberOne of the Shanghai Photo Studio has already been ordered by Miss Zhou. The photo of Wang Yang taken by [Village] Photo Studio has received the most orders so far. In the photo, Wang Yang is standing with a horse, exuding a charming posture. Mr. Xu, the Yiming Photo Studio, You Qi [company name], the Daxin Company, and Mr. Wu have each ordered a copy.

Yesterday around 10 a.m., Chen Yunshang, along with Chen Yanyan, Li Minghui, Hua Jieni, and Chen's mother, arrived gracefully. Chen wore a light pink and white Western suit, with silk ribbons in her hair, dancing like butterflies. Her beauty was stunning, and her smile was warm and inviting, evoking the feeling of "clouds evoking thoughts of clothing, flowers evoking thoughts of her face."

Several of the stars' photos have been used as covers for movie magazines. For example, the photo of "Lu Ming standing with an umbrella" was previously used as the cover of "Electric Sound," and the photo of "Tan Ying amidst flowers and grass" was also used as the cover of "Qingqing Movie."

Color photos are priced at one hundred yuan, and there are fewer buyers. However, the Yantai Changyu Wine Company specifically ordered one of Zhou Xuan. It is said that the company's Deputy Manager Zhu Mei admires her innocence, liveliness, and clear voice, and will soon film a promotional film "Grape Fairy," and may invite Zhou Xuan to star in it.

In this exhibition, there are only a few photos of male stars such as Zhang Yi, Shi Chao, Gao Zhanfei, and Shang Guanwu. Besides personal photos, Lao Shang also has a photo with Xiao Gao. Amidst the rumors of Lao Gao and Bai Yang's passionate love affair, Xiao Gao will surely feel some emotions! Shang Guanwu's heroic posture truly deserves to be the epitome of a great merchant. Nowadays, there are few people in the film industry who can take on this type of role, which is truly regrettable.

Starting from August 1st, this publication will reduce its size by two-fifths. Therefore, future submissions should be kept concise. Except for special features, each article should not exceed 700 words. We hope that all contributors will pay special attention to this. (Editor)

### The Art of Skating (30)

— Co-edited by Lian Junqi and Zhen

Conclusion on Four Edges

When learning the four edges, you must pay attention to the following four points: (A) When moving on the outside edge of the shoe, the movement of the free foot should always be outside the drawn circle.

The solid line in the diagram below shows the supporting foot, and the dashed line shows the path of the free foot.

(B) When moving on the inside edge of the shoe, the free leg must cross the supporting leg to the outside of the drawn circle. However, when moving to the front and passing the supporting leg (point A in the diagram), it must temporarily go inside the drawn circle, and then return to the outside of the circle after passing. The dashed line in the diagram shows the path of the free foot.

(C) After practicing the four edges, you must also pay attention to the form and position of the arcs drawn. The end of the first arc and the beginning of the second arc must be extended into a straight line, meaning the same direction of movement, so that the circle will not lose its shape.

(1) The abbreviation in the diagram below indicates the direction to take each step when moving from point a to point b.

(2) The abbreviation in the diagram below indicates that the direction taken when starting a step is incorrect, causing the position of the circle to shift.

This point is most easily seen when crossing the feet. The reason why it is difficult to learn to cross the feet forward and backward is that beginners do not understand this principle and do not know that the trajectory of movement is an arc.

(D) When skating in an arc, the whole body does not face forward. The body should be sideways, and the shoulders and hips should be parallel to the supporting foot at the beginning, and then gradually move to the position at the beginning of the second step along the arc of the first step.

Once the basics of the four edges are established, any patterns can be easily learned in the future.

Announcement from this publication: The Art of Skating has been published for thirty issues, totaling over 20,000 words. We are deeply grateful for the readers' love and discussion through letters! The introductory skating guide has now concluded with this issue and will no longer be published. We plan to organize the published and unpublished advanced skating techniques into a separate book. The content will be as rich and beautiful as possible. We will announce the publication date when it is available. We hope readers will pay attention.
