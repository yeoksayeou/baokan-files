Zhongxiang: The focus of the battle in central Hubei is on the Jingzhong Road. Two Japanese regiments have been fiercely attacking this line for days. Yesterday, one route of the Japanese army attacked the northwest of Dongqiao Town, 30 miles from here, and another route attacked Mumazhen, south of Cheqiao Town. After the Chinese army fought bravely to resist, the Japanese were defeated on both fronts. The Japanese army fled northwest from Sanyangdian. This morning, because the key points of Houjiaji and Zhangjiaji were occupied by the Chinese army, the Japanese army immediately retreated south. A certain Chinese commando unit intercepted them, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers. About 2,000 Japanese troops in Zhengjiaji, east of Jiukou, were counterattacked by the Chinese army yesterday, and most retreated to Sanyikou and Yejiaji. The Chinese army is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in these two places. On the Yonglong River, the Chinese have effective troops confronting the Japanese army. There is no change in the Yuekou area. (Telegram, 5th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, since the Japanese army invaded Hainan Island, casualties have reached 5,000. The battle situation on Hainan Island is now stabilizing. The Chinese guerrilla forces on the island are all based in the mountainous areas of the interior. They are constantly attacking the Japanese communication lines in the five coastal districts. At the same time, due to the extremely hot climate on Hainan Island and the lack of acclimatization, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers have fallen ill. The Japanese are now seeking to send 30 Japanese doctors from Taiwan to provide medical care. As for the southwest coast of Guangdong, the situation remains very tense, as the Japanese are still planning to land on the Leizhou Peninsula. (Associated Press Telegram, 5th)

### Xia County, Southern Shanxi: Japanese Army's Western Offensive Repelled, Many Wounded Soldiers Transported to Yuci, Japanese Increase Fortifications in Taiyuan Suburbs

Yuanqu: At 5:00 PM on the 3rd, a Japanese force of about 100 men, taking advantage of the dense fog, advanced from Guanmiao Qian "south of Xia County" towards the Chinese army's Wenjiazhuang alert line. They were severely attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army. The Japanese army suffered more than a dozen casualties and collapsed. The Chinese army only suffered one soldier wounded. (Telegram, 5th)

Hequ: More than 1,000 Japanese troops have been added to Ningwu. The Japanese have launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army positions on the watershed southwest of the county and in Dongzhai, using four airplanes to assist in the battle. The battle situation is extremely fierce. As of the evening of the 2nd, the situation in Dongzhai is unclear. (Telegram, 3rd)

(Xi'an) In recent days, it has been common to see wounded soldiers and corpses transported by the Japanese army from southern Shanxi to Yuci and Shijiazhuang. Electric-controlled landmines have been installed in the suburbs of Taiyuan to prevent the Chinese army from attacking, indicating that the Chinese army's guerrilla warfare in southern Shanxi has been successful. The Yamaga Regiment, numbering about 2,000 men, is now stationed in Taiyuan, strictly prohibiting the export of goods. Merchants engaged in transit trade have been unable to operate. (Telegram, 4th)

(Chongqing) According to what Chinese military sources told the Associated Press reporter, the recent activity of the Japanese army in Shanxi indicates that the Japanese army has been or is currently launching a two-pronged attack in southern and southeastern Shanxi. At present, there are three Japanese divisions, mostly concentrated in Houma and Anyang. The purpose of this move by the Japanese army is to eliminate the centers of activity of the Eighth Route Army guerrillas, including Zhu De's headquarters in a certain place. The Japanese army's targets of attack include Yuanqu, Puxian, Liaoxian, Xinshui, and Yangcheng. The Japanese army has changed its strategy this time, conducting a broader offensive in a larger area. After the B army captures a city, it no longer immediately attacks another city, but first carries out a search of the countryside, intending to concentrate its attacks on the key activity centers of the Chinese army. The purpose of this method of attack is to destroy the guerrilla's retreat strategy and form a "spider web," hoping to use this to surround the Chinese army's guerrillas. The Japanese army is building cement houses throughout the area, creating a "ring of iron" to surround the guerrillas. According to recent American military observers from Beiping, Japanese officers have also personally admitted that after occupying Yuanqu and Puxian, the Japanese army failed to hold them firmly, because the surrounding mountains were all bases of guerrilla activity, cutting off the Japanese army's supply lines. In many cities in Shanxi, after being occupied by the Japanese army many times, they were eventually recovered by the Chinese army's guerrillas. (Associated Press Telegram, 5th)

### All Sectors of Chongqing Expand Anti-Japanese Propaganda

(Chongqing) From the "July 7th Incident" to the fall of Yuezhou was the first phase of the war, the period after that is the second phase. In the first phase, the Japanese army's conspiracy to quickly defeat China without fighting has been exposed by the Chinese army. Now, in the second phase, the military has turned to the mountainous areas far from the transportation lines. The Japanese have lost their geographical advantage, and coupled with the various chaotic situations in Japan, the Japanese are in a dilemma. In an attempt to save their declining situation, the Japanese have put forward the preposterous slogan of establishing a new order in East Asia, attempting to quickly negotiate a peace and trap China in their trap, making it their slave for all time. In order to expose the Japanese plot, we will hold the first propaganda week of the second phase of the war from March 6th to 12th to support President Chiang's rebuttal of Konoe's absurd statement, the speech, and the main points of the opening speech of the Fifth Plenary Session. The methods are as follows:

(1) Propaganda rallies will be held uniformly in all places during the week. (2) Special radio broadcasts and lectures will be held. (3) Newspapers and publications will issue special issues. (4) Local authorities will organize propaganda teams to distribute propaganda in rural areas. (5) Lectures will be held in various schools. (6) Special propaganda will be held in various cinemas, theaters, and other entertainment venues. In addition, a large number of propaganda leaflets will be prepared and distributed to the war zones. It is also heard that the Central Broadcasting Station has invited ministers and heads of various ministries and departments to give radio lectures during the propaganda week. Those who have been scheduled include President Kong of the Executive Yuan, President Dai of the Examination Yuan, Minister Wang of the Foreign Ministry, Minister Ye of the Central Propaganda Department, Minister Chen of the Political Department, and Minister He of the Military Administration Department.

### Chongqing's Fundraising Competition: Women Donate 700,000, Led by Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling, Breaking the Record Held by the Banking Sector

(Chongqing) Today is the women's day of the two-week patriotic fundraising competition in Chongqing. Two thousand women gathered here. The patriotic donations from Chongqing women totaled 700,000 yuan, breaking the record held by bankers. President Chiang stated during his speech, "I have always believed that the strength of women is stronger than that of men. Today, this has been proven. Their strength is more than double." President Chiang also shouted, "Long live the women comrades!" Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling said, "Our success is due to our consistent organization and cooperation, and because we are constantly encouraged by our compatriots." This patriotic fundraising movement by women was led by Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling. Therefore, today's donations were made by Madame Chiang on behalf of the women. When the Secretary-General of the New Life Movement announced the amount of donations, the band played music for those who donated more than 10,000 yuan. Madame Chiang announced that her brothers Soong Ziwen, Soong Ziliang, Soong Zi'an, and her two sisters Madame Sun Yat-sen Soong Qingling and Madame Kung Hsiang-hsi Soong Ailing, each donated 10,000 yuan from their estates. Kung Hsiang-hsi had previously donated 10,000 yuan from his personal funds. Today, he donated another 70,000 yuan. Foreign journalists who were invited to attend also automatically donated 140 yuan and one US dollar and one British pound. Huang Wei (transliteration), a war correspondent for a Chinese newspaper in Singapore, auctioned off a Japanese army coat he obtained from the front lines in North China. Mrs. Zhao also auctioned off her gold watch. (Associated Press Telegram, 5th)

(Chongqing) The frugal donation competition in Chongqing on the 5th was the eighth day, also known as Women's Donation Day, presided over by Madame Chiang. After the donations began, the competition was very intense. The largest donation was 150,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance and 40,000 yuan from the Military Affairs Commission. Then the six Soong siblings (i.e., the three Kung, Sun, and Chiang sisters, as well as Ziwen, Zian, and Ziliang) jointly donated 100,000 yuan. President Kung alone donated 50,000 yuan. Various agencies also contributed to continued fundraising, raising a total of 632,359.32 yuan, an unprecedented record for donation competitions in various places. President Chiang also personally visited and, amidst cheers from the crowd, stood up to give instructions, saying that today's glorious patriotic movement has not only caused a sensation throughout the country, but has also attracted the attention of the world. I now thank you on behalf of the soldiers who are fighting hard at the front. In view of the people's emotions and spirit, not only will this guarantee that our country's current war of resistance will win the final victory, but also during the future nation-building period, it will generate even greater strength to engage in the great cause of nation-building. Finally, I want to shout, "Long live the women compatriots of the whole country!" Madame Chiang also gave a speech, encouraging the women compatriots to unite as one and strive to create a strong and glorious Republic of China. (Telegram, 5th)

Editorial

### General Mobilization of the Spirit

"Success is achieved with one heart, failure comes with divided minds," this is one of the philosophical foundations of the success or failure of China and Japan. In China: resistance means survival, non-resistance means destruction; and all kinds of suffering are caused by Japanese aggression; the morale is high. Examine the war zones or cities that have been bombed. Even if loved ones are killed or injured, families are destroyed, and they suffer all kinds of hardships, those whose lives are hanging by a thread will never blame the resistance. This kind of phenomenon where people share the same heart and the same reasoning can be said to be ironclad evidence that can be found everywhere in China. In Japan: members of parliament are still questioning the meaning and purpose of using troops against China; the people are hesitant and suspicious, and anti-war sentiment is gradually surfacing; and the letters and diaries of their fallen soldiers are especially filled with war-weariness. The two sides are very different, and China will surely succeed with one heart.

However, if we further enrich and temper it, the achievements of the war of resistance will be even more magnificent. According to a recent telegram from Chongqing, the central government has issued the "Outline for the General Mobilization of the National Spirit" and its implementation measures, which is to enrich and temper the existing shared heart and reasoning, and evolve from an abstract concept into a concrete norm. Regarding the outline, it lists three common goals of the national spirit: national supremacy, national supremacy; military first, victory first; concentration of will, concentration of strength. It lists loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace as the eight virtues of the general mobilization of the national spirit, and highlights loyalty and filial piety as the foundation. It takes the Three Principles of the People as the only faith in nation-building, that is, it takes the completion of the purpose of the Three Principles of the People as the destination of the general mobilization of the national spirit. For the transformation of the spirit, it especially emphasizes five points: the life of drunken dreams must be corrected; the vigorous spirit of vitality must be cultivated; the habit of living in a makeshift way must be eliminated; the attempt to be selfish and self-seeking must be broken; and the divergent and miscellaneous thoughts must be corrected. As for leading the mobilization, it is the responsibility of party members and civil servants, all military personnel, national leaders from all walks of life, and the youth of the whole country. The leading personnel of each organization are the main body for implementing the mobilization. For its implementation, first, formulate a concrete plan to ensure that it penetrates the subordinate elements; further, use existing organizations, pay attention to liaison and progress, to achieve the completion of the "total".

Among them, what we want to introduce to society most is the matter of implementation. Indeed, the general mobilization of the spirit is easy to know its necessity, easy to know its necessity; but it also seems very broad and difficult to define, it seems very vague and difficult to be practical; and it also has a wrong impression, it seems that since the launch of the war of resistance, the public sentiment has been exuberant, those who have given money have given money, those who have contributed their strength have contributed their strength, and it can be said that the general mobilization of the spirit has already been carried out. However, this is not the case. There are not many matters to be implemented, so it cannot be said to be broad; they all belong to the daily life, so it cannot be said to be vague; with these matters, considering the reality, it is necessary for everyone to work hard to realize everything, and the current situation is still very far from the completion of the general mobilization of the spirit. What are these matters?

(1) Regarding the correction of the life of drunken dreams: A, rectify the daily life of the people and ban all improper entertainment: B, ban luxury and extravagance and all unnecessary waste, C, limit consumption and reduce the import of luxury goods: D, persuade the people to reduce their living standards and implement universal austerity.

(2) Regarding the cultivation of vigorous vitality: A, cherish time, cherish manpower and materials: B, expand wartime production, increase national working hours and efficiency; C, organize and train the people, and give appropriate distribution to wartime work.

(3) Regarding the elimination of the habit of living in a makeshift way: A, publicize the failure of Japan's political and military strategies, and the reality that the Chinese army is getting stronger and stronger; B, report all idle and lazy elements, and force wartime service; C, eliminate dependence on the international community, the mentality of relying on luck, and the illusion of compromise halfway.

(4) Regarding breaking the attempt of selfishness and self-interest: A, earnestly eliminate corruption; B, encourage the people to destroy their families and alleviate the difficulties of the country, and donate personal property to war expenses; C, collect all military supplies and contribute to the national government; D, earnestly promote various movements to contribute to the country in spirit or material.

(5) Regarding correcting divergent and miscellaneous thoughts; A, rectify the organization and training of people's groups; B, unify the organization and work guidelines of cultural groups; C, ban disputes and illegal activities that hinder the war of resistance; D, correct the tendency of opinions in various newspapers and publications.

We have already said that the above-mentioned matters are still far from this standard in the current situation, and Shanghai is the furthest distance; however, the general society's ability to move in this direction cannot be concealed. From moving in the direction to approaching the standard, it lies in enriching the strength of moving in the direction, in order to increase the speed of moving in the direction; and the method of enriching the strength still lies in the tempering of will and action. Didn't we say earlier that the issued outline and implementation methods assign the responsibility for leading the mobilization to party members and civil servants, all military personnel, national leaders from all walks of life, and the youth of the whole country? In Shanghai, we especially look forward to the social leaders and youth, as well as the leaders in various circles and institutions! Don't say that it is not easy to promote and that it is difficult to achieve practical results; why not imagine what kind of society it would be after the general mobilization of the spirit has achieved 30-50% or even 80-90% results, then we know that people with lofty ideals and aspirations will surely act in person and move forward.

### The Entire National Education Sector Works Together to Promote the Three Principles of the People Education, Taking Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and a Sense of Shame as Common School Mottoes, Realizing the Principles to Strive for Final Victory, Chairman Chiang's Admonition to the Education Conference

Recognizing Responsibility in Three Major Matters

(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) The most basic task of education lies in the cultivation of national character. If we want to cultivate the national character of the entire population, we must ask the entire education sector to recognize its own position and responsibilities, concentrate on one goal, set an example, and create a universal atmosphere. Here, I have a few important words to remind all of you in the education sector. First, I ask our education sector to recognize the meaning of "respecting teachers and valuing the Way." The Book of Learning says, "In the way of learning, strict teachers are difficult. Only when the teacher is strict can the Way be respected. Only when the Way is respected will the people know to respect learning." Second, if we want to cultivate national character, we must have a consistent standard. In moral education, there must be common key points. While the detailed rules for the implementation of moral education may vary due to different regions and stages, the standards for moral education can be determined collectively. Currently, schools at all levels often formulate their own standards, which are inconsistent. My personal opinion is that the late Premier's eight virtues of benevolence, filial piety, fraternity, love, faithfulness, righteousness, harmony and peace can be set as codes of conduct for young people and party members. The four virtues of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame can be used as common school mottoes for lower-level schools throughout the country. These four virtues contain our country's inherent national benevolence and righteousness, and contain the qualities that citizens must possess. We use the meaning of "propriety" to teach the people to help and cooperate with each other. We use the meaning of "justice" to train the people to be responsible and willing to sacrifice. We use the meaning of "integrity" to teach the people to be hardworking and enduring, to distinguish between public and private matters, to abide by their duties, and to prevent encroachment. We use the meaning of "a sense of shame" to train the people to be self-reliant and self-improving, to know how to struggle, and to know how to be enterprising. In this way, these precepts, which have been deeply rooted in people's hearts for thousands of years, can shape the character of modern citizens, and then ensure the survival and development of the nation. Third, I ask our education sector to move towards a concentrated goal and strive to realize the Three Principles of the People. Since the first National Education Conference in April of the 17th year of the Republic of China, when we resolved to promote the Three Principles of the People Education, it has been ten years to this day. Even the promulgation of the educational purpose of the 18th year of the Republic of China is now ten years ago. Before the War of Resistance, our people and the general youth had not actually received the widespread education of the Three Principles of the People. Even in the present War of Resistance, we cannot sincerely and consistently believe in the Three Principles of the People. This is certainly the misfortune of the country, and it is indeed a common disgrace to our education sector.

Concentrating Under the Three Principles of the People

I believe that if the highest principles of revolution and nation-building cannot be universally imparted to the people, then the revolution cannot succeed and the country cannot escape danger. Our education sector bears the great responsibility for survival, prosperity, and decline. We must not outwardly comply but inwardly oppose the highest principles of the country. We must not accept them in form but still do things our own way in practice. The responsibility of education is to teach the people. A people without trust cannot stand. If the education sector first disagrees in heart and mouth, does not value trustworthiness, and does not emphasize implementation, how can we guide the people to the point of unified will and concentrated spirit? We know that the rise and fall of countries and nations, throughout ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, have always occurred. Whenever danger is turned into safety, it is always because intellectuals and the education sector, amidst divergent opinions and declining public morale, concentrate like-minded people into one goal and strive to shoulder responsibility. Now that the War of Resistance has entered its most important stage, what the enemy fears most is our Three Principles of the People, which are used for revolution and national salvation. If our education sector wants to save the country from danger, we must take the realization of the Three Principles of the People as our own responsibility. The Chinese Kuomintang has always earnestly expected and welcomed talented and wise people with the ambition to save the country to join our party and fight together. Especially during this time of the War of Resistance, when the country's survival hangs by a thread, we feel a deeper sense of camaraderie with the presidents and professors of all universities who are knowledgeable and prescient. The more revolutionary comrades we have, the greater our strength in the War of Resistance, and the easier our nation-building cause will be, and the sooner we will succeed.

With One Heart and One Mind, Self-Reliance and Self-Respect

If we want the revolution to succeed more quickly and strive for victory, at least the compatriots who bear the responsibility of education must work together with one heart and one mind and strive for the Three Principles of the People. Speaking of the efforts of education, as in Xunzi's "Exhortation to Learning," "The eyes do not see but are clear, the ears do not listen but are sharp," it also explains that the ambition of education must be fixed on one goal. If, at the crossroads of four directions, the eyes do not look straight at one end, and the ears do not listen in one direction, the result of wandering and confusion is that we cannot teach scholars who are brave in learning, earnest in practice, and save the country and the people. Now that the country is in an extraordinary period, time cannot wait, and national affairs cannot tolerate further mistakes. The lack of firmness and dedication in the past in education has already delayed ten years and caused serious national disasters. I sincerely hope that our education sector, for the sake of the future of the country and the nation, for the happiness of modern youth and future generations, will truly and surely converge on one goal. I hope that all of you virtuous people in the education sector, with one heart and one mind, will gather under the Three Principles of the People and strive for the Chinese revolution. Our national education sector itself has been working doubly hard since the War of Resistance, especially showing our efforts. We have seen the results of the hard work and struggle of the education sector in the war zones, in the occupied areas, and in remote places. I dare say that the victory of this cultivation will surely nurture the fruits of national rejuvenation. What we all hope for is naturally not the rewards of the present, but the comfort given to us after the great achievement of nation-building. However, our education sector must be self-reliant and self-respecting, wholeheartedly and single-mindedly, and implement it with the ambition of cultivating people for a hundred years and the public spirit of "if not me, then who?" What I have said above is contributed to those who are engaged in education and saving the country for life. The ancients said, "If you carve and give up, rotten wood will not break. If you carve without giving up, gold and stone can be opened." This is a certain principle of achieving one's ambition. I sincerely wish this conference success beyond all expectations, and wish our education sector to establish immeasurable merits for the War of Resistance and nation-building. (5th dispatch)

### Since the War of Resistance, Changes in the Chinese Newspaper Industry, 209 Newspapers Have Ceased Publication, There Are Currently 117 Kinds of Newspapers

(Chongqing) According to the Hua Fang report, since the Sino-Japanese war began, a total of 209 Chinese newspapers have ceased publication, including 58 in Peiping, 15 in Qingdao, 18 in Nanjing, 27 in Tianjin, and 21 in Guangzhou. At present, there are 117 newspapers in the rear, including 19 in Chongqing, 1 in Xinjiang, and 1 in Qinghai. (Translator's note: The reason why the telegrapher specifically pointed out one in Xinjiang and one in Qinghai is that the above two provinces each have only one newspaper.) Of the 117 in the rear, only one is published in English, namely the former "Hankou English Chu Pao" in Hankou. The newspaper resumed publication in Chongqing four days ago (i.e., March 1). Also, several newspapers formerly published in Shanghai have now moved to Hong Kong for publication, such as Ta Kung Pao, Lih Pao, and Shen Pao. There are currently 20 Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong. Also, Chinese intellectuals publish "paper bullets" in the rear of the Japanese army for Chinese people in the Japanese-occupied areas to read. This kind of Chinese "paper bullets" is most abundant in Shanxi Province, with a total of 45. Currently, guerrilla teams in Shandong Province issue two kinds of newspapers, three in Jiangsu Province, two in Anhui Province, and one in Hebei Province. Among these "paper bullets," the North China edition of the New China Daily and the Former Front edition are the most famous. The North China edition is published in Shanxi, and the Former Front edition is published in Dongxu (transliteration) in Anhui. The printing of the above two newspapers is very good. Also, various periodical magazines are published in the Japanese-occupied areas, one of which is even published in the foreign concessions of Tianjin. Also, a patriotic movement has been launched in the rear of the Chinese front, namely publishing newspapers for soldiers at the front to read, providing them with spiritual food.

(Chongqing) The new French Ambassador to China, Cosme, flew to Chongqing from Kunming on the morning of the 5th. Government officials stayed at the airport to welcome him. The French ambassador got off the plane first, and all the welcoming personnel stepped forward to shake hands and express their greetings. The ambassador returned the greetings one by one, and after a brief exchange of pleasantries, he took a car back to the French Embassy to rest. It is reported that the date of the French ambassador's presentation of credentials will have to wait until he meets with our Foreign Minister Wang, presents a copy of the credentials, a draft of the eulogy, and a list of accompanying personnel, and then the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will prepare a letter to the National Government, which will be forwarded to Chairman Lin for approval before it can be determined.

### President Roosevelt's Speech, The American Democratic Spirit, The People Enjoy God-Given Freedom, Totalitarianism Is a Disguised Form of Despotism

(Washington) President Roosevelt recently delivered a speech at a joint session of the Senate and the House of Representatives, recounting the founding of the United States of America, saying, "The United States was founded after a struggle between a majority of national heroes and a majority of traitors." This statement is already well-known. The American people have resisted various enemies with courage for a long time, and finally established a national representative system based on free choice. I would like to specifically state the word "free choice," because this foundation is the ideal of a democratic system, which was already popular all over the world several years ago, before the emergence of totalitarianism. The principles established by the American Constitution have also been adopted by other countries. The so-called democratic system is based on two main concepts: one is that the national electorate should elect a new Congress and a new President every few years, and the other is that this choice should be made freely. This is where the democratic system differs greatly from other political systems. These so-called other political systems, which seem novel on the surface, are actually old things. In essence, they are merely the restoration of a despotic regime. Some may say that we are now exhausted, and therefore we have expressed a fondness for this kind of regime that has returned, which has been proven by the facts of two thousand years to be tyrannical and unstable. This is absolutely not true. The United States and other democratic countries should be cautious so as not to encourage this kind of argument. (All members applauded warmly upon hearing this.) Thereupon, the President discussed the various freedoms listed in the Declaration of Human Rights one by one, and said that the freedoms enjoyed by the American people are actually the weapons to deal with the illegal means left over from the "Dark Ages." "Speaking of freedom of belief, this is one of the main rights of mankind, and the establishment of a representative government is also rooted in this right. On the contrary, in any place where the democratic system has been destroyed, the individual's right to worship God according to his belief is either restricted or completely deprived. If we let it go and remain silent, we are probably encouraging religious discrimination. What the American nation has won by peaceful means is not only freedom of belief, but also various other freedoms that we firmly believe in. These freedoms come with the freedom of choice enjoyed by men and women, and the democratic system clarified in our Constitution is based on this as a guide." (4th Havas dispatch)

### US Congress Celebrates 150th Anniversary, Senate and House Hold Joint Meeting to Celebrate, Various Dignitaries Give Speeches Praising Democratic System

(Washington) Today is the 150th anniversary of the founding of the US Congress. The Senate and House of Representatives held a special joint meeting to celebrate. President Roosevelt, Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and many other dignitaries gave speeches praising the democratic system. The situation is briefly described as follows:

The joint meeting of the Senate and the House of Representatives was held in the House of Representatives at noon today. All the members of the House of Representatives and the majority of the audience first took their seats. Then, all the senators, led by Vice President and President of the Senate, Garner, and Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, entered the venue in droves. The members of the diplomatic corps and the judges of the Supreme Court followed, and the applause throughout the venue was thunderous and extremely enthusiastic. Afterwards, the senior officers of the Navy and Marine Corps, and all the cabinet members, led by Secretary of State Hull, entered the venue one after another and took their seats next to the platform. At this point, Vice President Garner ascended the podium and announced the arrival of President Roosevelt, and the whole audience cheered wildly for a long time. Under the illumination of the electric lights, the President took his seat. Behind him hung a huge American flag. After the applause subsided, Ms. Swarthout, a famous opera singer, sang the "America" song. After the song, Speaker of the House of Representatives Bankhead, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Barkley, Leader of the Senate Democratic Caucus, gave speeches one after another, praising the American democratic system. After the speeches of the dignitaries, Mr. Thomas, a famous singer from the opera house, sang the "America" song again to entertain the guests. Then, Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court spoke, saying, "Legislative power is the foundation of the democratic system. The authority enjoyed by our country's legislative body, and the responsibilities it bears, have not been destroyed by despotic labor, nor have they been hindered by it. This is something to be thankful for. (Thunderous applause) The greatest aspiration of the American people is that the current administrative system must be preserved. There is no doubt about this." In addition, Hughes defended the rights enjoyed by minorities, which was particularly approved by the whole venue. Finally, President Roosevelt gave a speech, strongly advocating that the government, Congress, and the Supreme Court must cooperate with each other, and the American people firmly adhere to the various freedoms listed in the Declaration of Human Rights. (For the full text of the speech, see another telegram.) The President did not touch on foreign affairs in his speech, which was unexpected by most people. However, he said, "What we call a democratic system refers to men and women who enjoy freedom to freely choose what they like. In other words, this democratic system should be implemented by representatives elected by the people, not directly by the masses." After the President finished speaking, Ms. Swarthout and Mr. Thomas, two singers, sang the "America" song together, and the joint meeting was then declared closed. (4th Havas dispatch)

### Berlin Feels Displeasure

(Berlin) The speech delivered by US President Roosevelt today on the 150th anniversary of the founding of the US Congress has been fiercely attacked by the semi-official German News Agency, commenting, "President Roosevelt's statement that there is no freedom of belief in totalitarian countries is a slander. The American government relies on a weak majority faction and must issue calls to the masses at any time and place. On the contrary, the German government is supported by 99% of the people in the country, and all its measures are not influenced by political ideas or any interest groups. The two are as far apart as heaven and earth. We do not want to persuade President Roosevelt to embrace the political ideas of the five countries, but we do not allow him to interfere in our country's affairs." What this gentleman calls freedom of speech is nothing more than abuse and incitement. The media in totalitarian countries cannot tolerate it. German newspapers do not use lies and incitement as tools of struggle. Certain politicians and warmongers who constantly provoke are exposed by German newspapers. President Roosevelt admits that he wants to find progress for culture and should take the attitude of German newspapers as an example. As for the freedom enjoyed by public officials, there are many abuses, and there have been many bribery cases recently to prove it. (4th Havas dispatch)

### US President Submits to Congress an Additional Budget for the Army, Totaling 120 Million Yuan, to be Used to Purchase Military Equipment and Strengthen Coastal Defenses

(Washington) President Roosevelt recently sent a letter to Speaker of the House of Representatives Bankhead, requesting the immediate passage of an additional budget for the Army of $123,812,923.7 (Note: The House of Representatives yesterday passed the National Defense Expansion Plan, of which $499,857,936 is required for the Army.) The purpose is as follows: (1) Purchase various necessary military equipment, such as anti-aircraft guns, tank defense guns, cannons, gas masks, etc. (2) Train 20,000 civilian aviation pilots. (3) Strengthen the defense of the Panama Canal, requiring a total of $1,416,373. (4) Strengthen coastal defenses, requiring a total of $3,295,631. At the same time, President Roosevelt also stated that he would request Congress to approve the allocation of funds to build highways in the Panama Canal area in the future. (4th Havas dispatch)

### Japanese Army Invades Hainan Island: Beginning of Southern Expansion Policy; French General to Fill Post of Vietnamese Governor, Expediting Defense Plans

(Tokyo) According to news from here today, the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island was advocated long ago by powerful figures in the Japanese Navy. The Navy has been promoting Japan's southward expansion for several years. Recently, a Japanese political and economic magazine published an article by a naval admiral advocating southward expansion. The article first discussed the abundance of oil, tin, and other resources in Southeast Asia, and then put forward the slogan: "For the sake of the wealth of the Japanese Empire, Japan should expand southward." Furthermore, domestic propaganda in Japan has always emphasized not only the abundance of resources in Southeast Asia, but also that the indigenous people of Southeast Asia are all naked and barefoot. Therefore, cheap Japanese cloth, shoes, and socks will undoubtedly sell well. This is because the living standards of the indigenous people of Southeast Asia are extremely low, and they can only afford to buy Japanese goods. Therefore, if Japan can expand southward, the markets of the Dutch East Indies, other parts of Southeast Asia, and the Philippines will all be acquired by Japan. In theory, this market can be acquired peacefully, but in reality, it is absolutely impossible. Since 1933, after the Dutch East Indies enacted restrictions on imports, Japanese goods imported into the Dutch East Indies have been severely impacted. Forty percent of Japanese exports, including textiles and hardware, have been squeezed out. The result of the Japanese-Dutch East Indies meeting in 1934 was that the import volume of Japanese goods into the Dutch East Indies was further reduced. Thus, it can be seen that the path of peace has truly been blocked. Therefore, the Navy has come to advocate the use of force. At the same time, the Navy has an urgent need for oil, tin, and rubber, and these products are particularly abundant in the Dutch East Indies. Furthermore, the Japanese Army has already gained considerable honor in its war against China, but the Japanese Navy has been left idle, with no place to use its heroism. For these various reasons, the recent occupation of Hainan Island has occurred. Furthermore, this action is actually the initial step in Japan's southward expansion. Hainan and Annam are only a few hundred miles apart, truly within reach. Moreover, after occupying Hainan Island, Japan can form a pincer movement with its mandated islands in the Pacific, taking a flanking position against the Philippines. If an air route is established from the Japanese mandated islands to Hainan Island, it can traverse the Philippines. According to observations from foreign diplomatic circles here, there are four reasons for Japan's occupation of Hainan Island: (1) Because France refused Japan's request to appoint Yosuke Matsuoka as ambassador to France; (2) Because the French Parliament recently advocated that all goods imported into France from Japan must be labeled with the words "Made in Japan." Japan views this action by France as a prelude to boycotting Japanese goods; (3) Since the Munich Conference, Tokyo has largely believed that democratic countries do not have the power to attack dictatorial countries; (4) As a base for attacking the eastern colonies of democratic countries. As for other so-called "military necessities," etc., they are purely deceptive talk. (Reuter, 4th)

Saigon According to reliable sources, the position of Governor-General of French Indochina will henceforth be held by a military officer. The most promising candidate is General Boucher, the former commander-in-chief of the Vietnamese Army. According to opinions here, using a military officer instead of a civilian official for the Governor-General position will allow the currently emphasized defense plan to be completed sooner. The defense plan proposed by the Vietnamese government includes: (1) Training 20,000 new Annamese troops; (2) Improving defenses along the Chinese border; (3) Seeking closer cooperation between naval, land, and air forces. In recent weeks, several new bombers have arrived from France to strengthen the air force here. It is expected that the number of warships in southern Guangdong will increase greatly, as France is currently undertaking an active shipbuilding program. Japan's occupation of Hainan has awakened the attention of French Vietnam to the fact that it is now closer to the Far Eastern theater of war. However, people here remain very calm, as there is no need to worry for the time being. The various indications that the Vietnamese government and Singapore are maintaining extremely close contact are very welcome. Furthermore, the recent visit of Sir Thomas, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, to this country is also considered a very significant event. Admiral Noble, the commander of the British China Fleet, also recently visited Saigon by ship and was warmly welcomed. Noble inspected Cam Ranh Bay, located 200 miles north of Saigon. This bay is a frequent anchorage for French warships. If fortifications are built, it will become a Singapore-like base for French Vietnam. (Reuter, 5th)

### Agenda of the Soviet Communist Party Congress

(Moscow) The 18th Annual Congress of the Soviet Union will be held here on the 10th of this month.

### Hitler's Close Friend Appointed Consul General in San Francisco

(New York) Captain Gudermann, a close friend of German leader Hitler, arrived here today and will go to San Francisco to take up the post of Consul General. Gudermann did not discuss politics with reporters, but said that his sole purpose was "goodwill." (Reuter, 4th)

### American Dockworkers Block Steel Shipments to Japan; Picketing Movement Extends to Pacific Coast

The movement to block steel shipments to Japan in Astoria, Oregon, has been remarkably effective in the United States. Recently, twenty-one cars of steel were to be shipped to Japan from this port on the Japanese freighter "Norway Maru." Dockworkers in this port refused to load and unload them, and the strike has lasted for eight days, preventing the shipment. At the same time, 7,000 tons of steel in Portland, 160 kilometers from here, were to be loaded onto the Greek freighter "Staturos" for shipment to Japan. This was discovered by the picketing team organized by Chinese women and children in this port, who plan to stop it. In view of this situation, the local authorities, fearing unexpected disturbances, decided to prohibit the shipment of steel to Japan from tomorrow. In addition, the Greek freighter "Kostis" in Marshfield (300 kilometers south of here) was also prevented by a picketing team from loading steel for export. Similar problems are arising in various ports one after another. Mr. Bridges, president of the Pacific Coast Division of the Industrial Organizations Association, is already considering whether to extend this picketing movement to various ports along the Pacific coast.

### Japan Exploits Astrologers to Prevent War-Weariness Among People; Fortune-Telling and Predicting Calamities Can Involve Lies

### Major Developments Imminent in Indian Situation; Gandhi's Blood Pressure Rises and Sleeps Poorly on Second Day of Fast

New Delhi The Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, has decided today to shorten his trip to Rajkot and will arrive here tomorrow morning. This news has aroused great attention among political figures here, who believe that major developments may occur tomorrow. (Reuter, 5th)

Rajkot According to a report released today by soldiers attending Gandhi, Gandhi's blood pressure has risen from 168 to 180, his weight has decreased by two pounds, he has slept slightly poorly, and his physical condition has weakened. Mrs. Gandhi, who has been detained in a camp near Rajkot since February 3, was finally brought by the authorities in a car to Gandhi's bedside today. Because Gandhi did not know if his wife had been released, he ordered her to return to the detention camp tonight. According to reports, his wife came to Rajkot specifically to participate in the passive resistance movement, which led to her detention by the authorities. (Reuter, 5th)

Bombay Gandhi is currently fasting because the Raja of Rajkot refuses to implement new policies in his kingdom. The Secretary of the All-India Congress Socialist Party recently published an article on this matter, advocating that an ultimatum with a 24-hour deadline be sent to the British government, which has supreme ruling power, urging it to protect Gandhi's life. If the request is not granted, all cabinet members of the All-India Congress should resign en masse. According to reports, most of the All-India Congress cabinet members have telegraphed the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, requesting him to intervene immediately. (Reuter, 5th)

Bombay It is heard that the Bombay cabinet has now decided that if Gandhi is still fasting on Monday the 12th, the entire cabinet will resign. (Reuter, 5th)

### Letter Requests New Pope to Convene World Religious Leaders Conference; Discuss Elimination of War Based on Reason and Common Sense; Key Figure in British Labour Party

(London) A key figure in the opposition Labour Party, Lansbury, recently sent a letter to the new Pope Pius XII, asking him to convene a conference of Christian and Jewish leaders in Jerusalem during Easter this year. His letter stated, "If responsible politicians from various countries could gather together and conduct discussions based on reason and common sense, then all land, economic, and financial issues that isolate governments and lead to war could find peaceful solutions. It is regrettable that no politician has yet boldly shouted to the world, 'Why don't we prioritize reason?' Therefore, I am now requesting Your Holiness to immediately convene a conference of religious leaders from all over the world, including Jewish leaders, to discuss what methods should be used to pressure politicians from various countries to prevent them from continuing on the path to destruction, and to unite to preserve Christianity, so that it will not perish. If His Holiness can issue such a call, I believe the whole world will be happy to respond." (Havas, 4th)

### Pius XII Falls on Stairs; Arm Slightly Injured

Vatican According to news from here today, Pope Pius XII injured his arm when he fell down a staircase on Thursday. He was immediately examined by the Pope's personal physician. Fortunately, the bone was not injured, only a very minor abrasion. It is expected that he will recover within a few days. At the same time, it is heard that the Pope intends to restore the tradition of the Vatican and will perform the coronation in the central hall of St. Peter's. (Associated Press, 4th)

### US President Does Not Plan to Travel Abroad During Term

(Washington) State Department officials have decided that after the King and Queen of England visit the United States this June, Roosevelt need not reciprocate the visit. The reasons are as follows: (1) The King and Queen's trip is primarily to Canada, not a direct visit to the United States. (2) The King can make official visits in any year of his reign, while the President has a limited term. (3) The US President has the dual roles of head of state and prime minister, and his duties do not allow him to leave his post lightly. However, if Roosevelt visits Europe in a private capacity after leaving office, he will of course be free to do so. (Reuter, 5th)

### United States Creates New Type of Reconnaissance Aircraft

(Washington) A naval official recently stated that the United States has created a new type of reconnaissance aircraft. After test flights, the results were excellent. The technical characteristics are not convenient to disclose, but it can be used to replace existing reconnaissance aircraft in the future. (Havas, 4th)

### Incendiary Bombs Found in London Mail

(London) Postal workers found an incendiary bomb in a mailbag yesterday. Today, another incendiary bomb was found in a package sent to a senior official of Scotland Yard (i.e., police headquarters). According to experts' examination, this bomb was equipped with special components and was designed to explode when it reached the recipient. After receiving the report, the police immediately sent two detectives to the post office to check all mail sent to Buckingham Palace, the Prime Minister's residence, the Home Secretary's residence, and other departments.

### Warsaw as the Center of Behind-the-Scenes European Diplomacy; Italy Attempts to Enlist Poland's Support for Colonial Demands; Talks Between Romania and Poland Attract Attention

(London) According to Reuters, even in this seemingly quiet period, diplomatic activities are unavoidable, and they are not being overlooked simply because some of them are behind the scenes. In the view of various diplomatic correspondents, the international situation must wait until the Spanish war has been fully resolved and Mussolini has been able to express the extent of his demands on France before clear developments can occur. No one dares to make definitive predictions about the nature of these demands. However, some people believe that there are currently reasons to believe that the demands put forward by Mussolini will be primarily political, with land being secondary. Currently, the diplomatic activities that are attracting attention are concentrated in Warsaw. According to news from Rome, Gaeda, who is generally regarded as Mussolini's mouthpiece, recently accompanied Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to Poland and has now returned to Rome. According to his words, Poland will soon unite with Italy and Germany to form a tripartite front, making concrete demands for colonies. Gaeda suggested that major colonial powers should distribute their colonies to races that have the capacity for production, replacing the previous complete occupation with free trade guaranteed by products. At the same time, he also argued that countries with population growth should have colonies, because farmland in the vast world needs people to cultivate it. He also claimed that Italy, Germany, and Poland could supply what England and France could not supply in terms of agriculture and industry. After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano left Warsaw, Polish Foreign Minister Beck immediately shifted his attention to Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, who recently led a delegation to Warsaw. According to a Warsaw correspondent for the Sunday Times, the main issues discussed by the foreign ministers of Poland and Romania will be, on the one hand, the attitudes of the two countries towards the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, the possible expansion of Germany to the east. Other issues will be involved in considering the existing Polish-Romanian military alliance. This alliance has gradually cooled since the Munich Agreement, after King Carol of Romania refused to assist Poland's attempt to establish a common Polish border. It is now believed that King Carol of Romania has expressed regret for this attitude, having recognized that if Germany expands from Ruthenia, the seriousness of its threat will far outweigh the possible annexation of land by Hungary. It is heard that Gafencu's intention is to ascertain the Romanian side's views on this matter and to investigate the possibility of Poland and Romania jointly resisting German and Soviet attempts to invade the two countries by idealistic means. According to the correspondent, the foreign ministers of Poland and Romania will further attempt to strengthen relations with the Soviet Union. (Reuter, 5th)

(London) According to news from Rome, the talks currently taking place in Warsaw between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu have aroused great attention in Romania. It is said that the results of these talks may completely change the attitudes of the countries in Eastern and Southeastern Europe and adopt a broader policy of distancing themselves from German influence. It is said that the economic demands currently being made by Germany on the Danube region have been indirectly obstructed by Italy. This is why the Polish Foreign Minister warmly received Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, while anti-German demonstrations were occurring simultaneously throughout Poland. It is confirmed that the foreign ministers of Poland and Romania will discuss the Danube River issue. It is heard that in addition to providing special transportation convenience for Polish goods transported to the Black Sea and Danube ports, Romania will also grant Poland the free zone of Galati to compensate for the loss of Danzig-Gdynia benefits in the event of difficulties in the Polish Corridor. Furthermore, Beck may also try to make relations between Hungary and Romania more friendly. (Reuter, 5th)

### Cooperation Between Romania and Poland is a Factor for Peace; Colonel Beck Hosts a Banquet to Welcome the Romanian Foreign Minister

Warsaw After Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here this morning, Foreign Minister Beck gave a speech in the evening, saying briefly, "We firmly believe that Poland and Romania have the power to survive. Although there are various changes in the international situation, our attitude is extremely calm and not at all pessimistic." Foreign Minister Gafencu replied that the two countries' determination to cooperate is an important factor. All other countries, regardless of size or distance, should take this factor into account and use it as support, as long as they strive for European peace and culture. (Havas, 4th)

### Czech and Slovak Peoples Grow More Hostile; Slovak People Want to Leave Czech and Become Independent

Prague The mutual relations between the Czech and Slovak peoples within the Czech Federal Government have once again become an important issue. Some leaders of the Slovak people believe that the Slovak people can leave the Czech Republic and become independent. Their hostility to the Czech people is growing stronger. Recently, the German Vienna radio station has been broadcasting messages unfavorable to the Czech people in the Slovak language every day, which is said to be done by Slovak people. However, the economic situation of the Slovak Autonomous Province is not good. The provincial finances are insufficient to cover expenses, and there is a huge deficit. Although the central government has agreed to provide financial assistance, it requires Premier Tiso of the Slovak provincial government to publicly guarantee that he is willing to coexist in unity with the Czech people within the federal framework as a condition of exchange. The provincial government convened a meeting today to discuss this matter, but failed to make a decision and will continue to discuss it at a meeting tomorrow. Regarding this matter, those in charge believe that although Premier Tiso's attitude is moderate, the attitude of Cabinet Associate Seedor is difficult to grasp. Another faction, led by the director of propaganda, Mr. Maschu, clearly supports independence. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how this problem will be resolved. (Havas, 4th)

### Italian and French Military Officials Inspect North Africa

(Rome) Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio recently inspected defenses in the North African colony of Libya, paying particular attention to fortifications at the border between Libya and French Tunisia. He has now returned to the capital and immediately met with Prime Minister Mussolini to submit a report. (Havas, 4th)

(Paris) General Noguès, Governor-General of French Morocco and Commander-in-Chief of the garrison forces in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia in North Africa, returned home to report on his duties a few days ago. He left for the port of Tunis in French Tunisia, North Africa, this evening, and will then proceed to the fortress areas in southern Tunisia to inspect defenses, before returning to Paris via Morocco to present a report to the Mediterranean Affairs Committee on the 21st of this month. (Military and political affairs in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia are under the jurisdiction of the various departments of the cabinet. The Mediterranean Affairs Committee is responsible for coordination among these departments.) It is noted that when Premier Daladier inspected the various territories of North Africa in early January, the North African Defense Committee met in Algiers. At that time, General Noguès, Commander of the Garrison in Tunisia, and General Bubignière, Commander of the Garrison in Algeria, attended the meeting. General Noguès' visit to Tunisia is being carried out in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison in North Africa. Those in informed circles say that this trip has no special significance.

### Britain's Military Expansion Not Directed at Germany; Henderson Delivers Speech

(Berlin) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson delivered a speech at the banquet of the newly established German-British Association last night, saying that someone in Berlin had expressed anxiety to him, wanting to know the guarantee that Britain's military equipment would not be used to attack Germany in the future. He was willing to reply with the remarks made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the Lower House and Foreign Secretary Halifax in the House that British military equipment was only used for defense. The British Foreign Secretary's statement in the Upper House that the British parties would never make an aggressive war and could not embrace the hope that the people could support a policy of aggressive war was particularly noteworthy. The British parties, politicians, and individuals only had to resist any threat that endangered their independence or the interests of their survival with force in self-defense. German leader Hitler stated on January 30 that cooperation between Britain and Germany was the world's fortune, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain also spoke on February 22 in agreement with this view of the German leader. He believed that nothing could enable the establishment of world peace more than this. Therefore, he hoped that the audience would work together to seek the realization of British-German cooperation. (Reuter, 4th)

Then, the President of the Association, Schroder, gave a reply, saying, "For the sake of improving relations between Britain and Germany, the two countries should recognize each other's rights." Tielks, a London banker among the guests, also expressed his views. His main point was that the upcoming British-German industrial talks could promote the improvement of international trade relations in Europe. (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)

### Britain Recruits Air Force Personnel; Young People Enlist Enthusiastically; 400,000 People Currently Registered for National Volunteer Service

(London)

Sir Kingsley Wood, the Secretary of State for Air, announced in June of last year that the Air Force needed to recruit 31,000 officers and soldiers. The Ministry of Aviation has recently announced that the number of young people who have applied to enlist nationwide has exceeded the quota. However, because the British Air Force still needs to be expanded, recruitment will continue. (Havas, 5th)

(London) Home Secretary Anderson delivered a speech at a banquet of the Glasgow City Journalists Association last night, saying that the implementation of the National Volunteer Service plan was making great progress, which was gratifying. As of February 18, 400,000 people had registered with the authorities for voluntary service. However, it was regrettable that participation in fire brigades and ambulance teams was not very enthusiastic. (Havas, 9th)

### Franco Reaffirms Determination to Maintain Spanish Independence; Policies Not Manipulated by Germany and Italy; Former Enemies Willing to Become Friends Today

(London) The Sunday Chronicle recently published an interview with General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, reaffirming his determination to maintain independence and not be manipulated by Germany and Italy. He said, "One thing that needs to be explained is that Germany and Italy have neither requested Spain to cede territory nor requested the establishment of military bases in the country. I have conducted negotiations with the authorities of these countries in order to sign agreements to ensure that Spain should be ruled by the Spanish themselves, and not allow an inch of land to be controlled by foreign countries. What the world should understand is that after victory, if one is isolated internationally without friendly countries, then this victory will still be empty. Based on this concept, we sincerely wish to obtain the sympathy and understanding of all countries in the world, especially Britain. As far as Spain itself is concerned, we are also willing to reconcile with those in the country who used to be our enemies. I would like to state to them that although we used to be like fire and water, the ideals we embraced were the same sincere patriotism, and there were many common points between them. In short, if the enemy of the past can become a friend of today, and cooperate with each other, then Spain will be able to regenerate itself and occupy an appropriate position in the international arena." (Havas, 5th)

### After the Japanese Army Occupied Hefei, Commerce Has Come to a Standstill; Conflicts Occurred Within the Japanese Garrison

The *North-China Daily News* reports that the central Anhui region, containing parts of Anhui, Henan, and Hubei provinces, belongs to the Fifth Military District of the guerrilla forces under the command of the Chinese government. Three months ago, General Sun was ordered to pacify bandits in central Anhui and organize guerrilla units, commanding a portion of the Sixth Division guerrilla forces. General Sun's governance was effective, and now there is hardly any banditry in the rural areas. Farmers have returned to their homes, and the countryside is full of wheat. There is no opium planting in the areas managed by the Chinese army, so raw opium prices are quite high, about 26 yuan per tael. Last month, the two armies only fought three times. The railway was once demolished by guerrillas,

Blocking Transportation for several days. Two weeks ago, some Japanese soldiers stationed in Hefei launched an attack 20 li outside the city's southern suburbs. Fewer than 20 returned alive. On February 21, guerrillas attacked Hefei from three sides, firing at the city's guards. Although they retreated shortly after, it indicates that the Chinese guerrillas have made better preparations to drive the Japanese army out of central Anhui. Highways east from Hefei to the Jinpu Railway, west to Henan Province, and south to Anqing have all been destroyed by guerrillas to prevent the movement of the Japanese army's mechanized units. The guerrillas also cut off food supplies to Hefei, and prevent Japanese goods from being transported from Hefei to the countryside. Therefore, residents and sojourners in the city can only buy rice and vegetables from farmers in the area east of the city controlled by the Japanese army.

Commerce in the city of Hefei has come to a standstill, but commerce is quite prosperous in the villages 20 li away from the city because the areas within 5 li of the city are controlled by guerrillas. The Japanese authorities in Hefei are eager for people to return to the city and resume business, but they are unable to achieve their goal because they are deeply afraid of the guerrillas and because of strict inspections at the city gates. From a financial point of view, the city is "only going out and not coming in." There is also friction within the Japanese authorities in Hefei because the people are poor and the revenue of the Japanese puppet regime is very small. They plan to set up brothels and gambling dens as

Methods of Raising Money, but they gave up due to the poverty of the people. However, there is some income from the sale of morphine and opium. Some people who fled to the countryside due to the war have not yet returned to the city. The objects and goods in their residences and shops have been plundered and sold by the puppet regime. The internal conflict between the local Japanese special affairs department and the military police arose from the money earned from the stolen goods. The military police, jealous of the special affairs department's profits, arrested the head of the special affairs department and imprisoned him. It has been a month now, and the military police are the only ones respected in the city. Even the military police guarding the city consider the passes previously issued by the special affairs department to be invalid, and passes must be obtained from the military police. At least in terms of national dignity, this kind of internal conflict should be kept secret, but it is said that they are talking about it to the Chinese at will. Therefore, the local people know the details of the conflict. The personnel of the various ruling groups of the Japanese army in the city have been repeatedly changed, and the mutual jealousy makes it very difficult for the local Chinese puppet organizations because they have to flatter a certain major Japanese official, but they cannot determine which Japanese official can stay in office the longest. If they choose the wrong person, they will perish on their own. Therefore, the puppet organizations are quite uneasy. The actions of the various puppets are only to listen to the Japanese and search for wealth from the poor civilians.

### White Clouds Rise Above the Steep Cliffs, Mountains and Plains Enter Western Sichuan (Continued); Carrying Sedan Chairs to Climb the Ridges on Rugged Roads; Crossing the Iron Chain Bridge on the Luding River

Climbing Over Mountains

On the morning of the 23rd, we set off from Huntou and headed west along the mountain road. The places we passed were bare and barren, with very little vegetation. Occasionally, we saw people living on the slopes on both sides, with cooking smoke rising. Those living at the highest points were almost on the peaks. After traveling 15 li, we arrived at Sanjiao Ping, where we had a simple meal. Continuing forward, we reached Linkou, at the foot of the Feiyueling Mountain. Patches of snow accumulated at the higher elevations, and the climate gradually became colder. The height of Feiyueling is 3,600 meters above sea level. The locals call it Crow Ridge because many crows live on the ridge. As the name suggests, its treacherousness is evident. Although the height of the mountain is not as high as Daxueling, its steep slopes and difficult terrain seem to surpass it. Starting from Linkou, we climbed up the steps, gradually ascending higher and higher. The strange rocks were jagged and extremely difficult to climb. Although the ravines in the mountains were deep, the flow was not as unrestrained as the mountain streams of Daxueling. The reporter rode in a sedan chair straight up, but after only two or three li, the bearers were unable to cope. So I got down and put on straw sandals, holding a wooden stick, and climbed up the chaotic stone path, stooping over. By the time we reached Fulong Temple, we were already panting. Thinking of the difficulty of the Shu Road, it is truly harder than climbing to the blue sky. So we sat on a stone to rest and then went to visit the temple. We learned that the temple was built in the Yuan Dynasty, but due to years of disrepair, the temple has collapsed. A statue of a god in the middle was lying on a stone base, and the idols on both sides were also missing limbs and ears, dilapidated and unbearable. Then, mustering courage, we moved forward. The mountain path became steeper, forming a steep slope. Because the reporter was relatively fat, climbing was not easy. At this time, sweat was pouring down, my shirt was completely wet, my breath was short, my heart was pounding, my blood vessels were tense, and I almost felt dizzy and nauseous. Seeing this, my companions urged me to rest, fearing that something unexpected would happen. The bearers were afraid of an accident, so they carried me up again. At this time, the crows on the top of the mountain were croaking sadly, as if pitying our hard work. I remembered the ancient poem about Crow Pass: "Going up Crow Pass in the morning, going down Crow Pass in the evening, crows croaking hoarsely, the travelers have not yet returned." Whether it was written for this ridge, riding in a sedan chair only traveled a little more than a li, and the bearers could not support it because they had not had their opium fix. The reporter got down and walked again. After walking about three li, we finally reached the summit. I was exhausted and could hardly move. After resting for a while, I looked around. The snow, fog, and clouds were boundless. The peaks opposite were all in a hazy fog, and there was no way to recognize their true appearance. It seemed that I was already in the white clouds. There was a patrol post at the top of the mountain, with four or five armed soldiers roasting a fire inside. They stared at the reporter when I arrived, but did not ask where I came from. There was a small stone niche next to the post, with a newly made stone statue inside, but I did not know which god it was. From here, we went down the slope, but the stone path was wet and slippery, making it difficult to walk. The reporter had just boarded the sedan chair when, after less than half a li, one of the bearers in front suddenly slipped and fell to the ground. The reporter got down and walked again. After walking 15 li, we arrived at Hualinping. It was 3:00 PM. The town was in the middle of the mountain slopes, and the market was extremely desolate. We originally planned to stay here, but everyone suggested continuing on. So we moved forward again, walking on the cliffs, along the mountain path. The mountains on both sides were continuous, with deep ravines in between. The water flowed like thunder. We were always worried about falling. The human habitation gradually became sparse along the way, as we had already entered Luding County. At 5:30 PM, we arrived at Xinglongbao and stopped to stay overnight.

Deep into the Wilderness

Xinglongbao is under the jurisdiction of Luding County, a small market town in the valley. The market is deserted, with only a few restaurants and small inns. There is a small elementary school in the town, with few students and simple equipment. We stayed here overnight. On the morning of the 24th, we left the fort and headed northwest. The sun was warm and gentle, as warm as spring. On both sides were bare mountains, meandering through the desolate smoke and withered grass. The sand on the road was thick, flying in the wind, as if traveling in a desert. We had already gone deep into the wilderness. As we moved forward, we met several Miao people coming from the opposite direction, driving pack animals loaded with goods. One person was chanting non-stop, as the Kang people believe in Buddhism and recite scriptures while walking, sitting, and lying down. The sedan chair bearers hired by the reporter had been out of the pass several times and knew a little of the Kang language. They repeatedly said "Hamo Guo" and laughed at them. "Hamo Guo" means "I don't understand" in Chinese. Continuing forward, we climbed several steep mountain roads. In the mountains, we glimpsed the ravines gradually widening, and the water flowing rapidly, seemingly forming a river. Asking the bearers, we learned that it was the lower reaches of the Dadu River. Turning around a mountain pass, we saw a waterfall cascading down between two peaks, and we realized why the water was so rapid. After traveling 10 li, we arrived at Lengqi. The market was clean, and the streets were paved with lime and tung oil, quite like asphalt roads. There was an elementary school in the city, with many anti-war slogans posted. We had a simple meal here. We heard that last autumn, the town was destroyed by a fire, with 30% of the houses burned down. They are now actively rebuilding, and will soon restore its original appearance. From here, the mountain road goes up and down, winding and rugged. Looking at the high peaks in the distance, inserted into the clouds, the momentum is very dangerous. The fields below the mountain are connected, green in patches, contrasting with the wild grass on the mountain, quite different. There are many cacti along the road, with thick branches and leaves, very different from those planted in gardens in the interior. Walking to a dangerous rock, we saw a huge stone carved with a god statue. The local people carrying goods were burning incense and worshipping. At 12:00, we arrived at Luding County. Looking at the foot of the mountain in the distance, there was a foreign-style house, seemingly a church building. We entered the east gate, which had the four large characters "No Different from the Heavenly Palace." Entering the city, it was desolate, with gravel on the road. We rested in the Qiaodong Street and had lunch. After lunch, we went to visit the iron chain bridge.

Crossing the Iron Chain Bridge

Luding is located southeast of Kangding, occupying the Dadu River as the main route into Kang. In the fortieth year of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, the Tibetans rebelled. The Qing army went south and, after pacifying Dajianlu, built the Luding Bridge on the river. The iron chains at both ends were planted on huge rocks, and the railing pillars were made of iron. It was 13 zhang long and 9 chi wide, with a total of nine chains, covered with boards for people to walk on. There is a stele on the side of the bridge erected during the Kangxi period, with an inscription written by the Qing Emperor Shengzu, describing in detail the events of pacifying the rebellion and building the bridge. The Western Sichuan government sends people every three years to repair it. This stele still exists today. There is a newly erected stele east of the bridge, inscribed with the four large characters "Ancient Luding Bridge" by Chairman Liu Wenhui. The Luding Pass is located here, with a barrier set up, and dedicated personnel to manage the opening and closing. When the reporter went to visit, he saw this bridge spanning the river like a long rainbow, towering over dangerous cliffs and overlooking deep ravines. The water flowed rapidly, angrily churning up snow waves. Based on the experience of crossing the iron chain bridge in Rongjing the other day, when I almost fainted, I instructed the sedan chair bearers to support me while crossing, but the chains were still swaying softly. Looking down at the raging waves, I was quite apprehensive. Walking to the west end, my companions looked at me and smiled. Usually, this bridge is given a small repair every three years and a major repair every five years. It is said that a certain army entered Kang several years ago, and many soldiers drowned because they were rushing to cross, and the chains were broken. In recent years, the authorities have added special restrictions on crossing the bridge. All cattle, horses, and heavy goods are prohibited from passing, and only people are allowed to walk. After the reporter crossed the iron chain bridge, he saw a wooden boat in the river north of the bridge, carrying livestock. At this time, we walked westward along the mountain slope, the slope suddenly steep and slow. As we walked, we were suddenly fast and slow. We glimpsed smoke rising in the mountain pass, burning dry grass, probably people setting wildfires. When we passed Zali, the setting sun cast a touch of afterglow on the sparse forest. Soon, the chaotic mountains closed in, making us feel even more desolate. Looking west, a crescent moon was hanging on the top of the mountain. Remembering Su Zizhan's famous lines "The mountains are high, the moon is small, the water recedes, and the rocks appear," I felt that this scene was vaguely similar. When we arrived at Pengta, it was already dusk. We stayed here that night.

### Worthy of Attention: The Paper Industry in Zhejiang Province (3); the Authorities Should Urgently Invest and Encourage Development; Eliminate Old Methods and Genuinely Reform; Travel Correspondence from Eastern Zhejiang

In the villages I passed through, I saw paper-making households everywhere, with dozens or more than a hundred households in each county. However, the equipment was extremely simple. These paper mills are mostly located beside mountain streams, using water power to drive wooden wheels to move wooden stakes to crush bamboo pulp for manufacturing. I saw women and children doing this work along the way.

Raw Materials for Paper

Paper making is a major handicraft industry in eastern Zhejiang, so I carefully investigated it. There are many varieties of paper produced in eastern Zhejiang, such as Nanping, Huajian, Yuanshu, Luming, Fanggao, Haifang, Jingfang, and dozens of others. But they can be roughly divided into four categories: (1) Yellow-white paper, (2) Yellow burnt paper, (3) Straw paper, (4) Bark paper. Yellow-white paper is mostly used for writing, burnt paper is used for superstitious purposes, and bark paper is used for umbrellas, packaging, and miscellaneous purposes. The manufacturing methods of various papers are also different, but the general procedure is that the paper mill hires workers to cut down the new bamboo with fine and soft fibers, drag it down the mountain, and saw it into short poles of two chi to five cun. The bamboo green (ie, the epidermis) is separated from the inner flesh. The bamboo flesh has fine and long fibers, which are suitable for making white paper, while the bamboo green is coarse and brittle and is retained for making yellow paper. After the bamboo is cut into sections and the green is scraped off, it is crushed. This work is laborious, so it is done by women and children. After the bamboo material is crushed, it is dried in the sun and then immersed in a water tank. The length of time depends on the age of the bamboo material. After six or seven days, lime slurry is mixed with the bamboo pulp. This method of pickling the slurry involves piling the lime and bamboo material together. It can be pickled in about a month. Then it is steamed, usually for five days. After steaming, it is placed in the stream to wash away the lime and placed in a rotten material pond. After another ten days, it can be softened and rotten into a ripe material. After the raw material is made, it is again crushed into fine material by water power and stored in a material bucket for manufacturing. When making paper, the fine material is injected into the paper trough, mixed with vegetable glue and a little water. It is stirred with a bamboo pole. After it is uniform and pure, the paper curtain is placed in it, and it is copied into pages of paper by hand, placed flat on the bottom plate, squeezed out the water, and baked in the room to make it.

Should Seek Improvement

China is in a state of war today. Strengthening the total economic output of the people across the country is an important priority at the moment. To obtain large-scale production, industry is certainly important, but promoting handicraft production, in terms of its efficiency, is equivalent to large enterprises. Therefore, we should also pay attention to the paper-making industry in eastern Zhejiang, which is an important handicraft industry today. Because the annual paper production in eastern Zhejiang is very large, and most of it is exported to other provinces, but due to the following reasons, it cannot be fully developed: (1) Most of the paper produced is used for superstitious purposes. (2) The paper mills are all run by farmers in their spare time and by women and children, so they stick to old methods and do not know how to improve. (3) The materials taken by the mills are inconsistent, and the manufacturing methods are different, resulting in substandard and poor-quality products. (4) There is no sufficient capital, so the tools are simple and cannot be mass-produced. According to my observation, if the paper industry in eastern Zhejiang today can be reorganized and improved, it will be of great benefit to our country. To improve it, the best method is to strictly prohibit the manufacture of superstitious paper. The local government should be responsible for guiding the mills to improve tools and equipment and to unify and improve manufacturing methods so that the products can be standardized and of good quality. And the authorities should actively raise funds, loan them to the mills, to expand and improve all their facilities, and to make full use of this natural raw material and the surplus labor of the farmers, and to seek an increase in quality and quantity to meet the current needs.

Today, in Xi'an and Sichuan and other places, earthen paper is used to replace newsprint to print newspapers, to reduce the outflow of state funds. This is indeed a gratifying phenomenon. If the earthen paper can be improved in today, so that it can be used for printing, then a huge amount of capital outflow can be reduced every year. This assistance will be of great benefit to the wartime economy.

### The Rugao Self-Defense Force Recaptures Dongchen Town; the Japanese Army in Yangzhou Is Panicked

Taixian Correspondence: The Rugao Chinese Army Self-Defense Force attacked the Japanese army in Dongchen Town on the 22nd. The two sides came into contact. By 9:00 AM, the Japanese army was unable to resist and retreated to Rugao. Later, at 12:00, more than 100 Japanese reinforcements came from Rugao and engaged the Self-Defense Force again. The fighting stopped at 3:00 PM. As a result, because the Self-Defense Force fought valiantly, Dongchen Town was recaptured. Dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. Only one or two members of the Self-Defense Force were injured.

Gui Ban, the commander of the Japanese army in Xiannvmiao, Yangzhou, went to Xishan on the 23rd to command military affairs, strictly preventing the Chinese army from counterattacking. At the same time, he attempted to attack Yong'an Town. On the 24th, he forcibly dragged dozens of people to build a fort in front of the Japanese army headquarters in Xiannvmiao. Now, the Japanese army has also set up the Jiangbei Garrison Headquarters in Wang Boling's residence in Xiama Mountain, Yangzhou. The military police have moved to the Zhong residence on Xinma Road. The puppet opium prohibition bureau is located in the Zuowei Street Central Bank. Five hundred Japanese and puppet troops are stationed at the two departments of the provincial Yangzhong Middle School.

### Public Prostitution Is Implemented in Jiangyin

Jiangyin Correspondence: Since the Lunar New Year, the scene inside the city has been bleak, and mobile teams are also everywhere. He Peixuan, the puppet magistrate, and Bian Shang, the puppet police chief, have both received warning letters with drawings of human heads, urging them to wake up. Bian Shang, the puppet police chief, recently registered prostitutes in order to increase his income. Public prostitution has been implemented since then.

### Sports News: Charitable Football Brings Thunderous Cheers; Lido Defeats the Army United 2-3; Leading Two to Zero in the First Half; Aquin Performs Excellently; Pu Zaiyuan Matches Gao Jun; the Game Ball Is Purchased for 500 Yuan

The second charitable football tournament organized by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, Lido vs. the Army United, was held at Yiyuan yesterday morning at 10:30. It was expected to rain heavily. Although it cleared up yesterday morning, it reduced the number of spectators, leaving a third of the seats empty in the five-cornered stand. In total, there were less than 10,000 people. As a result of the fierce battle, Lido's strength was abundant. Although Sun Jinshun was unable to play due to illness, they still scored two goals in the first half. In the end, they won three to two. Both goals scored by the Army United were penalty kicks. The Army United is based on West Foss, which has maintained an undefeated record in the A League, supplemented by Jiele and Hailiesun from East Celai. Lido defeated them in one fell swoop, earning a lot of glory for the Chinese team. Mr. Yu Qiaqing was six minutes late yesterday morning and did not have time to preside over the opening ceremony. However, during the halftime break, he personally presented the football from the previous match between the Chinese League and the Western League, which was purchased by Mr. Gao Huaide for 400 yuan. The ball used in yesterday's game was auctioned off by Mr. Pu Zaiyuan for 500 yuan.

Two to Zero: Xu and Wang Score Consecutively

The 30-piece orchestra led by Tang Qiaosi played the national anthem, and the charity match began. Mr. Yu was one step late and did not have time to kick off. Lido attacked first. The field was muddy like a swamp, making it difficult to run. Li Yichen advanced sharply and passed to Cao Qiuting. Qiuting sent it to the center, Li and Xu made a double feint, and Zhang Mingsheng rushed up and kicked it diagonally out of the field, which was a pity. The Army United counterattacked. Dengken took a corner kick, and Tangmusen headed it too high. The offensive was still controlled by Lido. After a stalemate for 23 minutes, Xu Wenkui finally broke through alone, using Yichen's smoke screen, and pulled his foot from 20 yards away to shoot fiercely. Although Aigensun caught it with both hands, it still slipped into the net due to the strong momentum. Lido opened the scoring. The Army United launched a fierce counterattack. Tangmusen shot, but was shoveled diagonally out by Meng Yiliang. Soon, Maikelong passed two players in a row, and Tangmusen shot into an empty goal. Lu Yituo turned it into a corner kick. Then, Zhang Mingsheng dribbled the ball deep and crossed it. Yichen ferried it, and Wang Kehou kicked it into the goal. Two to zero. Only four minutes had passed since the first goal, and the crowd cheered wildly. The Army United tried desperately. There were two dangerous situations in front of Lido's goal. The Army United's five forwards advanced in a single line. Folaise shot low, Chang Lu caught it and slipped, holding it on the ground. Maitangna pushed the ball into the goal from his arms, but it was not counted as a foul. In the first half, Lido won by two goals.

Yu Qiaqing Presides Over the Ball Presentation Ceremony

During lemon time, Li Guiyong reported the total ticket revenue from the previous match between the Chinese League and the Western League through a loudspeaker and invited Mr. Yu to preside over the ball presentation ceremony. Mr. Yu personally presented the ball used in the previous match to Mr. Gao Huaide, a director of the Lido Sports Association, for safekeeping. The audience applauded thunderously. The ball was specially equipped with a chrome-plated base, and the surface of the ball was stamped with gold letters, which read "January 8, Republic of China, Shanghai International Relief Committee, Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, invited the Chinese League team and the Western League team to hold a charitable football match at Yiyuan. Mr. Gao Huaide generously spent a large sum of money to buy the ball to help the needy. This inscription is to commemorate his kindness and righteousness." Below was Yu Qiaqing's autograph. After the ceremony, Tang Qiaosi's band began to play, and Tang sang a section of the Lido Sports Club song, with extremely heroic tones.

Penalty Kicks Occur Again and Again

The game resumed, and the situation gradually stabilized. The Army United's offensive gradually became fierce. Dengken rushed in, and Lu shoveled it out. Tangmusen shot, Chang Lu caught it head-on. Li Yichen spotted a loophole, avoided Jiele, and handed it to Qiuting, who was just about to shoot, but he and Kehou let each other, and the opportunity was lost, which was a pity. The Army United shot three times, but all were blocked. Shi Meili took a free kick in the middle of the field, Folaise shot diagonally, Chang Lu chased, and Luosi rushed up diagonally and kicked it. Fortunately, it was saved by Lu. At 23 minutes, Maitangna rushed in, Xin Fuzhen accidentally bumped into him, and a penalty kick was awarded. Tangmusen kicked it, but there was no way to turn the tide, making it two to one. Lido counterattacked, Qiuting cut into the center, and Wenkui drew his bow, but it was caught by Aigensun. Unexpectedly, the defense was in trouble again. Tangmusen shot, and Lingen hooked it, hitting the crossbar and bouncing back. Lu turned it into a corner kick. After Tang kicked it out, Wang Kehou was heading it for rescue when he was penalized for a penalty kick again. Tangmusen tied the score at two each. It was 27 minutes.

Xu Wenkui Establishes the Victory

At 29 minutes, Xu Wenkui broke through Shi Meili and Hai Daoxun in a row, and then flicked over Aigensun, scoring in one fell swoop. Lido regained the lead with three to two, and the overall situation was also established. Order booklets and hats flew from the north and south stands, and the audience cheered wildly. In the last 15 minutes, the Army United's attack became even fiercer, and the situation became more and more tense. Luosi shot, and Dengken followed with a fierce shot, hitting the post and bouncing back, extremely dangerous. Jiele took a free kick, Chang Lu knelt down and slipped, Folaisai and Maitangna rushed forward side by side. Fortunately, Chang Lu quickly blocked it. The Army United's five forwards shot in succession, but Lu saved them all. Soon, the final whistle sounded, and Lido defeated the Army United by three to two.

Pu Zaiyuan Generously Contributes

After the game, the game ball was auctioned off by Li Guiyong and Xi Yushu. Starting at 200 yuan, Mr. Gao Huaide increased it to 450 yuan. Finally, Mr. Pu Zaiyuan, general manager of the Putian Road Pu Zaiji Cleaning Bureau, won it for the highest price of 500 yuan. Amid the thunderous applause of all eyes focused, he stepped down the steps at the invitation of the International Relief Committee and took a group photo with Mr. Yu and others to commemorate the event. It is said that the ticket revenue yesterday totaled more than 2,200 yuan.

### A Record of the Shanghai Student Tennis Team's Expedition to Hong Kong and Macau (Part 2)

Fourth Match Against Macau

The team traveled to Macau on the 8th for their fourth expedition match against the Macau representative team. Li Guofan played the first singles match and decisively defeated Miro with a score of 6-4, 6-0. In the second singles match, Tang Jiaze underperformed and lost to Liao Yifang with a score of 4-6, 5-7. Cai Guoji won the third singles match against Fei with a score of 7-5, 7-5. The Shanghai team won both doubles matches, resulting in an overall victory of four to one. After the match, Li Guofan and Liao Yifang played an exhibition match, which Li won easily in straight sets. According to reports, Liao is a good player in Macau, but his skills are not superior to Tang. Tang's defeat resulted in Shanghai losing the opportunity for a clean sweep. The Shanghai team received a grand reception in Macau, and they returned to Hong Kong that evening.

Fifth Match Against Kowloon

The fifth match was against the Kowloon Cricket Club, held on the 9th at the club's court. In the first singles match, Li Guofan faced the club champion, Gassett. Li's powerful serves and diagonal long shots made it difficult for Gassett to defend. However, Gassett's performance that day was far below his usual standard. In the second singles match, Tang Baojia played more calmly than in previous matches and was able to defeat his opponent. Cai Guoji lost to Fincham in the third singles match. In the first doubles match, Li and Tang faced Fincham and Crawford. Li and Tang won the first set 7-5, but the second set was stopped due to darkness at 8-8. In the second doubles match, Wei and Xu initially won the first set against Kelly and Diener, but then lost the next two sets. However, Kelly's serve had exhausted his energy.

Sixth Match Against the Chinese Athletic Association

The sixth match was against the Chinese Athletic Association on the afternoon of the 11th at the association's court in Causeway Bay. The Chinese Athletic Association boasts Xu Wei Pei, Run Pei Kun brothers, and veterans Jiang Daozhang and Li Huitang, making them a strong team that dominates Hong Kong. Da Xu was even selected as our country's representative for the Taiwan Cup. Tang, of course, was outmatched. Since Li Guofan had no hope of winning against Da Xu either, he played the second singles match against Li Huitang. Guofan played cautiously and won both sets. Cai Guoji lost to Li Rurong in the third singles match.

The first doubles match between Li and Tang against Xiao Xu and Jiang Daozhang was one of the most exciting scenes of the entire match. In the first set, Li and Tang initially fell behind 1-5 but rallied to win 9-7. Xu and Jiang won the second set 6-4. In the third set, Li and Tang led all the way, but Baojia missed five "match points" in a row, resulting in a 9-11 loss. The Shanghai team also lost the second doubles match.

Seventh Match Against the Indians

The final match was on the afternoon of the 12th against the Sukanpoh Indian Recreation Club. The Shanghai team was tired and fatigued after several days of competition. In addition, their opponents, the Lun brothers, are considered top players in Hong Kong, resulting in a two-to-three defeat. Li Guofan played against Da Lun, but his spirit was low and he lost 0-2. Tang Baojia also lost to Xiao Lun. Wei Zhenxing easily defeated Omarling with a score of 6-1, 6-0. In the mixed doubles, Li and Tang cooperated well and defeated Xiao Lun and Mata with a score of 6-3, 6-3. Wei and Cai fought fiercely against Da Lun and Omarling, but Wei and Cai lacked endurance, allowing their opponents to prevail.

Li Guofan's Reflections

The team stayed in Hong Kong for a total of eighteen days, resting for only two days. They played seven matches, winning four and losing three, for a total of thirty-two games, winning eighteen and losing fourteen. Li Guofan was the most impressive performer in the exhibition matches. In the singles matches, he won all five except for the loss to Da Lun. Tang and Chen Zhiqiang Liao Yifang were also defeated by him in the exhibition games by 2-1 and 2-0 respectively. Tang always played doubles with Xiao Tang, and they only lost one of the seven matches to the Yu Run Jiang Daozhang team. Tang Maijia was not as fierce as usual, lacking confidence and appearing flustered, resulting in four losses. His performance in the mixed doubles was also not as good as in Shanghai. According to Li Guofan, the tennis level in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai. There are numerous clubs there, and the courts are provided free of charge by the government. Rackets and tennis balls are also cheaper, so the burden on players is lighter. The mild climate is suitable for training year-round, leading to greater improvements in skills. Both Chinese and Western players in Hong Kong excel in doubles over singles. This competition against famous players in Hong Kong and Macau was very beneficial. They gained a lot of experience and received enthusiastic hospitality and encouragement from all sides. They are especially grateful to He Jiaqiu for arranging the competition schedule. (The End)

### Standing Committee Meeting of the Refugee Production Education Fund Raising Association Resolves to Amend School Award Measures and Organize a Production Education Design Committee

The Fundraising Committee of the Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, recognizing the importance of refugee production education, has vigorously promoted the "Le Shan Zhang" (Charity Badge) fundraising campaign. Schools have been enthusiastically registering with the Shanghai Bank to claim the Le Shan Zhang. Although the campaign has only been implemented for a short time, it has already reached the expected number, demonstrating the attention of all sectors of society to refugee production education. In order to promote the realization of refugee production education and to ensure the complete success of the fundraising work, the Association held a Standing Committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday at its office on the third floor of 93 Guangdong Road. Dozens of people attended, including Zhang Zhonghuan, Du Zuozhou, Liu Chongben, Li Hongshou, Xu Zexiang, Sun Yucai, Lin Buqi, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Rongzhen, Zhong Yiming, Xie Xiangzhi, Yao Huiquan, Liang Zhongyuan, Sun Xiaolou, Zhou Zefu, Mao Derun, Chen Qingshi, Huang Zhongsu, Shen Xibin, and Tang Guoxun. Chairman Xi Wangshu presided over the meeting, and several proposals were discussed. Excerpts are as follows:

Award Measures Regarding Article 2 of the Group's Award Measures, which stipulates that a school whose students donate Le Shan Zhang exceeding half of the total number of students will be awarded a "Le Shan" certificate by the Association. This was previously advocated by the majority at the meeting of principals at all levels. This time, the Education Group's fundraising participation includes schools at all levels, including universities, specialized schools, middle schools, vocational schools, supplementary schools, and elementary schools. When awarding certificates, it should be calculated separately. For example, if a school has a university department, a middle school department, and a supplementary school, it should be treated as three units. For another example, if a supplementary school has seven branches, each branch should be treated as one unit. Furthermore, the ranking awards in Articles 2 and 4 of the Award Measures should also be calculated according to each unit of each school to ensure fairness and encourage participation. How should this be decided? It is specially proposed for a public decision. Resolved: (1) For schools with departments at all levels, or with multiple branches, the fundraising results should be calculated separately for each unit according to the proposed method. (2) The form of the certificate should include a drawing of a Le Shan Zhang in the center, with the word "Certificate" written beside it. The certificate should also specify whether it is graded as A, B, or C. As for the style of the frame and the silver quality, as well as the inscriptions, the Association's president and vice president are requested to prepare them in advance and pass them at the next meeting. (3) If someone donates a whole number of funds to the Association, Le Shan Zhang should also be issued. However, they must be issued at the end of the Group's fundraising work.

Production Plan The production education plan needs study in the process of escape in the fundraising work. This Association should formulate a detailed and complete plan to publish to the society, so that people of the society sympathize with the profound production education, and the purpose of this Association has a good effect. This plan is said to be under research by the Association's post-disaster relief department. This Association should organize a design committee to specialize in planning work, on the one hand, collect the existing production education work, and on the other hand, publish in newspapers to broadly seek opinions and plans from all walks of life, so as to gather opinions and expect results. It was resolved that the design committee would be established and research the plan at the next Standing Committee meeting, as proposed.

Recognition Situation Since the recognition of the Le Shan Zhang, the fundraising of the schools has been effective. A statistic has been added, as of today, there are a total of 198 elementary schools, with more than 23,700 registrations, 109 secondary schools, with more than 36,050 registrations, 27 colleges and specialized schools, with more than 11,300 registrations, 22 church schools, with more than 11,300 registrations, 12 Bureau of Public Works schools, with more than 10,000 registrations, 14 supplementary schools, with more than 9,700 registrations, for a total of more than 102,000 registrations. In addition, there are more than 5,000 yuan for those who automatically or directly add badges with cash to the bank, such as more than 20 schools such as Chongshi Elementary School, which are not included. (According to this statistical table, in the university department, Shanghai University is the most, secondary schools are the most by McTyeire School, Bureau of Public Works Girls' High School, Shanghai Girls' High School, and Kunfan Girls' High School, supplementary schools are the most by the Fourth China Vocational Supplementary School and Lixin Accounting Supplementary School, and elementary schools are the most by Juemin, Cunde, Tonghui, and Ningbo Shanghai Elementary School.) In this situation, the work has only been carried out for four days, and the results are already satisfactory. There are still six days, and it is hoped that the school authorities will make persistent efforts and work hard to raise funds, and the results should be more considerable. However, after detailed inspection of the statistical table, there are still many schools that have not registered, and there are even many schools that have registered, but the number is very small. From this point of view, the tomb work of this group cannot be considered satisfactory, it is appropriate to raise funds, it was resolved to step up fundraising, and each of the schools that have not received and received less are selected one by one, and each group of standing committee members will persuade them with sincerity, and on the one hand, this association will send a special letter to urge them.

Other Matters (1) This Association has published two special issues in the Shen Bao on February 23 and March 1, and it has now been decided to borrow the position of the Popular Weekly this month (Monday) to publish a special issue on the Education Group's fundraising. Please send the manuscripts directly to Mr. Ma Suogan of the Shen Bao for processing. (2) The painting advertisement in the Shen Bao has been sponsored by someone to donate to Deng Deng for three days, and now I want to publish three days in the News, and the advertising fee will be borne by the directors of this group to reduce the expenses of this group. (3) Director Xi reported that Mr. Yang Meinan transferred 1,000 yuan from the souvenir funds of Taikoo 洋行 to assist the Association, and a thank you has been issued. Yu Qiaqing, chairman of this group, praised the Association's work for being exceptionally hardworking and effective, and specially donated 1,000 yuan to encourage it. (4) The fundraising situation of this Association has been contacted with the Amusement Broadcasting Group, and each radio station will publicize it every day on its behalf. (5) The next Standing Committee of this Association will be held at 4:00 PM on the 14th of this month (Tuesday), and will be convened again at the original location, and then the meeting will be adjourned.

Guoguang Middle School Organizes a Le Shan Zhang Competition Private Guoguang Middle School not only strictly manages and educates students, but also pays great attention to social relief undertakings. The school recently assisted the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association in donating and selling Le Shan Zhang. The extracurricular activities guidance committee of the school initiated the organization of a competition method for donation and sale. Those students who donate and sell the most of this Le Shan Zhang will be awarded a small Le Shan silver cup as a reward. After three days of competition among all teachers and students, the total number of donations and sales reached more than 1,000 pieces. The best personal results were achieved by Hong Zhixin and Xu Dingkang in the second year of junior high school, and they each won a Le Shan cup. These students are able to do their best for the pleasure of doing good and benefit the refugees.

### Opinions on Education Reform: Some Problems Concerning the Reform of the National Language Subject (3)

— Yang Jinhao

(3) Regarding grammar, rhetoric, sentence structure, and expression methods in textbooks, detailed discussions should be carried out, and ancient and modern texts should be compared as much as possible. Compare articles with spoken language, compare articles with the same subject matter but different styles, and compare articles of the same nature but with different writing methods. At the same time, students should be taught to add circles and dots to famous quotes and excellent sentences to cultivate their ability to discern and appreciate. Students should be taught to write short sentences, summarize the main points, and express their feelings in the margins of each paragraph and at the end of the article (or in a separate notebook) to cultivate their thinking ability. In addition, typical characters and events should be analyzed at any time. For example, the "Fisherman" in the Songs of Chu is written about three kinds of people: one is the drunk and turbid crowd in the world, one is Qu Yuan who refuses to go with the flow, and one is the fisherman who seizes the opportunity to make profits at any time. This is the same as Lu Xun's "The Clever Man, the Fool, and the Slave" and his discussion in the fourth section of "Half Summer Collection" about the traitors, hermits, and martyrs after the fall of the Ming Dynasty. Although the writing methods are different, the image or character of the three typical characters they write is the same. When teaching, not only should the expression techniques of these three texts be compared and studied, but also the three typical characters should be analyzed and criticized. Later, Chu Chuan Baicun's "Idiot" can be taught, which is the same type of righteous person as a "martyr", "fool" and "Qu Yuan", so as to encourage scholars to rely on the truth, be serious and brave, and seek welfare for the nation, the country, society and the people. Now let's talk about the writing exercises of scholars.

(4) Composition is usually once a week or twice every three weeks in junior high school, and once every two weeks in high school. I think it is better to read more than to write more, because scholars' writing is clumsy. After writing more, it will become a habit, which will be harmful and unhelpful. Therefore, composition in junior high school can also be prescribed once every two weeks, and the composition time of another week can be replaced by discussion, sentence correction, recitation, dictation, etc. The composition topics should be within the scholars' experience and knowledge. Composition revision should add more marks and marginal notes, and the overall evaluation must be practical. Unnecessary old-fashioned comments are unnecessary. In each semester, you can submit several compositions, only review but not revise, and return them to the scholars for self-correction. After re-transcription, submit them to the teacher for detailed revision, which is easier to improve. Individual guidance when issuing papers is also very important, which can make scholars pay more attention to and understand their writing shortcomings and correction methods, and be more careful in the next composition. As for the common mistakes made by the students, they should be publicly discussed and corrected after the papers are issued. Some national language teachers ask others to revise the composition, which is not in line with the teaching principles.

(5) Reading notes can be prescribed to be submitted once a month, with equal emphasis on internal teaching materials and extracurricular reading. The purpose is not only to make scholars know more new words, understand more difficult sentences, and read more good books, but also to train scholars in thinking organization, logical deduction, and writing habits. Therefore, in addition to annotating new words and difficult sentences and recording famous quotes, it is also necessary to extract the outline and main idea of the article or book and thoughts after reading.

(6) Weekly diaries are mostly used with the printed item format. This is really too rigid. Sometimes scholars have many events to record, but because the space is limited, the writing is very cramped, or it is done hastily. Sometimes scholars have nothing to say, but because the items are printed, they have to embellish it, so it becomes hypocritical and perfunctory. Therefore, it is better not to print the item format on the weekly diary book. However, some weekly diary items and practices can be printed on the book to remind scholars. In fact, it seems more reasonable and practical to change the weekly diary item to a life diary and submit it to the teacher for review after writing a general check at the end of each month.

(7) The achievements of the above items, all of which are good, are announced from time to time for public imitation and reference, and to arouse the academic competition among students. Other extracurricular assignments—such as publishing wall newspapers, printed materials, and composition competitions—should be encouraged, guided, and held as much as possible. In addition, I think that each grade should have one hour of weekly meeting time, during which the national language teacher guides scholars to hold meetings to discuss speeches, debates, and other matters, so as to harmonize the mutual feelings among students, train students in civic knowledge, enhance students' academic thoughts, especially develop students' speaking ability, which is closely related to language and literature.

(8) Finally, national language exams (excluding composition) should not only give mechanical questions—such as dictation, explanation, translation, filling in words, correcting errors, etc. This makes it easy to cultivate scholars' habit of studying books by rote. Special emphasis should be placed on more flexible questions—such as describing the main idea and feelings of a certain lesson, and asking questions from an entire unit—so as to force scholars to painstakingly solve the teaching materials they read and seek thorough understanding. After teaching "Biography of Yuan Yuan" in Huaijiu High School..., I gave such a question in the exam: "After reading..., briefly describe the situation of the Ming Dynasty and try to compare the similarities and differences with the current war of resistance in our country." Students who study books by rote can never do this question. My purpose is to make scholars read books in a lively way and pay close attention to reality at the same time.

(9) As for calligraphy, it is originally the responsibility of the national language teacher to guide. However, today, as long as the writing is clear, it is enough. If you really want to study the style of calligraphy, it has become an art. Most of the new national language teachers may not be familiar with various styles of calligraphy, especially may not be able to recognize the personality of the scholars through their handwriting, so as to guide them to copy a certain kind of stele. Therefore, I think that in the future, calligraphy should be hired by experts to be in charge of the guidance.

4. The tasks, training, and treatment of teachers (1) Because the national language subject has the most complex influence on scholars, and because the national language teacher has the deepest understanding of scholars, the national language teacher should, and also is most convenient to, take into account various aspects such as language skills and ideological knowledge, character, and behavior to train scholars. Therefore, the task is also the most important.

(2) In addition to studying language, literary history, literary and artistic thoughts, and writing skills, national language teachers should also be familiar with historical background and realistic situation. As for other common sense, they must also be broad. Therefore, they must read newspapers every day, read important literary and artistic journals and masterpieces, and should also choose and read general magazines and books. Their own character and behavior must be more carefully cultivated to become a model for scholars. At least one meeting of all national language teachers in the school should be held every month to exchange teaching experience and discuss improvement methods.

(3) The training and education influence of national language teachers is actually greater and deeper than that of the training and education director. Therefore, it should be clearly stipulated that they must also be class tutors. At the same time, national language teachers spend more preparation time and paper revision time than teachers of other subjects. Therefore, in addition to the regular salary, composition revision fees should be added to make them more willing to do their jobs. In recent years, prices have soared, and the treatment of teachers in general schools has decreased instead. In order to be forced to live, teachers will inevitably be distracted by other things. As a result, teaching efficiency is reduced, which must be corrected immediately. Teaching is originally a hard career, but it must also be taken into account that teachers' lives can be maintained. Especially national language teachers who cannot have too many part-time jobs (I think each national language teacher should teach two classes of national language to do their job well), the treatment should be increased.

Some people think that the scope of the national language subject is too narrow, and even the status of the national language subject is too low, so that the national language subject cannot achieve as many effects as it should on scholars. This is very regrettable. In the future, we should regard the national language subject as the most basic course for training scholars to become new Chinese citizens, and give it special attention and reform. (End)

### Shanghai Finance in the War of Resistance

— Qian Zhiping

(I) Introduction

From the end of 1936 to the outbreak of the 'July 7th' Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident), it can be said that China's economy was at its peak. Due to the implementation of the legal tender policy and the general prosperity of the domestic economy, the development of the financial industry during this period was unprecedented. New enterprises were established one after another, and both domestic and foreign bond markets rose to 80-90%. The artillery fire at Lugou Bridge (Marco Polo Bridge) erupted at this time. This war of resistance was unprecedented in nature. Shanghai, which has always held the financial hub of the country, has also been affected as never before. Strangely enough, China's financial institutions were not considered sound in the first place, but whenever an incident occurred, they were always able to cope with ease and turn danger into safety. As for what has happened in the past, such as the "September 18th Incident," the "January 28th Incident," the "Minbian Incident," and the "Silver Export Problem," of course, comparing this war of resistance with the past, the nature is unknown how many times more severe. The "July 7th" Incident occurred in North China, and it was not immediately felt to be very serious. The "August 13th" Incident (Battle of Shanghai) happened on a Friday, followed by two days of closure for Shanghai's banking and money industries. On August 16th, business resumed, and at the same time, the government promulgated regulations to stabilize finance, restricting withdrawals to no more than 5%, on the one hand to prevent capital flight, and on the other hand to maintain the financial industry. In addition, the most important thing was the handling of rediscounting by the Shanghai Four Banks Rediscount Committee and the handling of interbank lending by the Bank Reserves Committee. The two are similar in nature; the difference is that the rediscount conditions are stricter, and the interbank lending conditions are looser. With rediscounting and interbank lending, legitimate industrial and commercial activities would not be stagnant due to lack of funds. These are the results of the government's painstaking efforts and the financial industry's meticulous planning. Of course, it is not to say that with the above coping methods, the financial industry can be completely free of panic and losses, but rather to reduce panic and losses to a level that does not cause any shakeup in the financial industry!

(II) Financial Panic and Losses in Shanghai during the War of Resistance

This can be discussed from three aspects. The financial industry controls the lifeline of all industries. When the war of resistance broke out, the general market was panicked, and the financial industry could not escape this scope. At the same time, there are two special things related to the financial industry:

A. Responding to Withdrawals　At the beginning of the war, based on psychological factors, general depositors withdrew funds one after another within the possible scope of the financial stabilization measures. Banks, of course, had to work hard to cope. In the six months before the war, it was the most prosperous period in China's economy, and the deposit amounts of various banks were estimated to have increased by 10% to 20% and even 30% compared to the end of 1936. After this widespread withdrawal, the numbers decreased significantly. If we compare the reported deposit amounts of various banks at the end of 1936 with those at the end of 1937, we can see the decrease in the deposit amounts of various banks at that time. According to the Shanghai Commercial Bank's business report, at the end of 1936, deposits were 15,379,000, and at the end of 1937, deposits decreased to 12,921,000. Another example is the business report of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, which showed that at the end of June 1937, deposits were 72,730,000, and at the end of December of the same year, they decreased to 56,350,000, which is clear evidence.

B. Losses on Loans and Investments　Many banks invested in real estate, and the losses in the occupied areas are still impossible to estimate. In addition, all banks hold public bonds, and now the unofficial market price of public bonds has fallen below the statutory price, but this is illegal. Banks still calculate the statutory price when using public bonds as collateral to the Four Banks, so there is no loss to speak of. As for loans, there are credit loans and mortgage loans. Some credit loans cannot be recovered because debtors have moved or died. Mortgage loans suffer even greater losses due to the destruction of collateral in the occupied areas. Therefore, a peculiar psychology has emerged, believing that credit loans are more reliable than mortgage loans because as long as the debtor exists, recovery is possible. The safety of the collateral is instead not as good. In fact, even if the collateral has been destroyed, the debtor cannot be relieved of the responsibility of repayment, but this is a legal issue, which will not be discussed in depth here. We only look at the losses suffered by the loans and investments of various banks due to the war, which is undeniable.

(III) Shanghai's Financial Industry under Abnormal Development

The above is the situation at the end of 1937. By 1938, the situation had changed drastically; this change is undoubtedly more accurately based on political reasons. After the National Army withdrew to the west, Shanghai changed from the front line of the war of resistance to a relatively safe rear area. As Nanjing fell and the war moved west, the general wealthy class regarded Shanghai as a comfortable nest and came one after another. With them came a batch of mobile funds. At the beginning of the war of resistance, everyone was afraid that the legal tender would be unreliable and that the banks would be shaken, so they bought foreign exchange and hoarded cash; later, seeing that the legal tender had not changed or shaken much, and that the purchasing power of the legal tender both domestically and externally could be maintained, some of the escaped funds turned from foreign exchange to legal tender one after another: the cash hoarded in safe deposit boxes was also deposited into banks together. This major change caused the deposits of Shanghai's financial industry to change from decline to a sharp increase. Although the numbers are difficult to estimate, they are definitely not small.

Now everyone is clamoring "funds to the interior." If this batch of hot money in Shanghai flows to the interior, it can help develop the southwest and be of great benefit. Conversely, if it stagnates in Shanghai and is not used properly, it will directly and indirectly create opportunities for others, which is extremely harmful. Let's take a look at the harmful aspects.

(IV) Prosperity of Consumption Industries and the Rise of Speculation

Since Shanghai became an isolated island and the population concentrated rapidly, the consumption industry has also prospered. Whether it is the upper, middle, or lower class of consumption industries, business is booming, making a fortune from the "national crisis." These many consumption industries can be divided into three categories: (1) those originally in the concession area, (2) those relocated from the war zone, and (3) those newly established. But they all have the same goal: to intensify the consumption of China's lifeblood of foreign exchange and maintain Shanghai's original position in the country's foreign trade. This phenomenon is really heartbreaking to speak of. Generally speaking, the prosperity of a place's industry and commerce is closely related to the place's capital utilization policy. Although the prosperity in the isolated island is caused by its special political status, the truth that the hot money filling Shanghai has not been put to proper use cannot be concealed.

What is even more unbearable is the use of hot money for various speculations, fueling many financial storms:

When the unofficial foreign exchange market first appeared in Shanghai, the forward rate was high, and the spot rate was low; therefore, a large portion of the funds was used for arbitrage transactions. Not long ago, two loans from the United Kingdom and the United States were established, and the foreign exchange market stabilized. Those engaged in arbitrage could not profit, so they turned to public bond speculation. The most concrete manifestation of the rise of speculation is the proliferation of small money shops and silver companies in Shanghai. The business of these small money shops and silver companies includes remittance, discounting, foreign currency trading, and bond trading. Recently, the remittance discount has been decreasing, which has dealt a blow to the activities of small money shops. As for them, they can be divided into two types. One type, with a smaller scope and limited capital, buys and sells on behalf of customers, which is actually equivalent to facilitating capital flight. The other type, with a larger scope, directly engages in speculation, requiring huge amounts of working capital. If people in the industry have considerable relationships with the financial industry, they may be able to obtain huge loans.

In addition, real estate investment has led to "large-scale construction" in the concession area. Some of the newly emerging small factories in the concession area after the war have problems with the source of their raw materials or the destination of their products. These investments are obviously unreasonable. In short, some of the hot money concentrated in Shanghai has already had a negative impact, which is a serious problem at present.

(V) Conclusion

"Those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength." At this critical juncture of the nation's survival, every citizen should contribute his greatest strength to the country. The southwest is now standing on the front line of the war of resistance. The southwest has very abundant natural resources, and what it lacks most is development funds. But Shanghai's financial industry is allowing rampant hot money to have a negative impact? The current speculation will one day turn into a hurricane that destroys Shanghai's financial industry. If we do not quickly adjust the current method of using hot money, everyone will regret it too late in the future. I hope that the financial authorities will quickly unite and work together to find a solution.

4. Expansion of Banking Business during the War

Following the first year of the war of resistance, the dynamics of Chinese banking business have shown significant performance. Regarding the central and chartered banks, there are three articles of the Measures for Reviewing Foreign Exchange Applications promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on March 14, six articles of the Rules for Purchasing Foreign Exchange, and the control of export foreign exchange promulgated on April 4, with a total of seven types promulgated successively. At the same time, legal tender was promoted to the border provinces. For example, Yunnan Province used Yunnan banknotes, but in the past year, due to the government and chartered banks adding branches in Yunnan Province, the widespread circulation of legal tender was promoted.

The war business dynamics of provincial and municipal banks: (1) The foreign exchange of Yunnan Province is handled by Fumin New Bank, and its control methods are: (1) Export goods should settle and sell foreign exchange according to the buying price of Fumin Bank; (2) Export goods can be mortgaged and borrowed from Fumin Bank and handle follow-up mortgages or reserve funds; (3) For the necessary foreign goods in the province that are suitable for military and people's livelihood, after the application is approved by Fumin Bank, foreign exchange will be supplied according to the selling price. (2) The issuance of subsidiary currency: Due to the lack of subsidiary currency in Jiangxi Province, the Provincial Department of Finance, together with Jiangxi Yumin, Jiangxi Construction, and Nanchang City Bank, organized a five-cent subsidiary currency note issuance and custody committee to issue 800,000 five-cent subsidiary currency notes, valued at 4 million legal tender. The issuance method is quite cautious, that is, the copper yuan notes already issued by the three banks of Yumin Construction and Nanchang City are limited to be recovered and invalidated at 280 cash per string (the value of each string is approved by the Ministry of Finance), and to receive five-cent subsidiary currency notes, there must be reliable collateral, and it must first be approved by the provincial government, and the prescribed use is limited to recovering copper yuan notes, civilian pawnshops, civilian factories, wasteland reclamation, and agricultural products. The Hunan Provincial Bank also issued 5 million subsidiary currency. (3) The expansion of rural loans: The Fujian Provincial Bank cooperated with the governments of various counties, with each county receiving amounts ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan. The Hunan Provincial Bank, the Guangdong Provincial Bank, etc. have all provided large amounts of loans. (See below)

As for the expansion of banking business, there have been a total of eight in the past year. Two of them increased capital, three added savings business, two expanded branch offices (one of which belongs to the increase in capital), and two expanded organizations. The content is as follows:

(1) Sze Ming Bank: The Xiafei Road office in Shanghai was expanded into a branch office on January 1.

(2) Sichuan Provincial Bank: The Neijiang office under its jurisdiction was expanded into a branch office in March; the Huijiang, Taihezhen, Longchang, Santai, Fushun, and Wu exchange offices were expanded into offices from August 1. The bank also increased its capital to 10 million yuan on August 20.

(3) Guangxi Bank: A savings department was added from July 1, and in order to encourage savings by civilians and employees, a small savings account was specially established. The initial deposit is more than one yuan, and after that, no matter one corner or five points, it can be deposited at any time. The interest rate is 4% per annum, and there are additional interest methods.

(4) Guangdong Provincial Bank: In order to expand rural loans, a rural loan department was added in April.

(5) Shaanxi Provincial Bank: An additional 3 million yuan of official funds were allocated.

(6) Chongqing Bank: A women's savings department was added on May 18.

(7) China General Chamber of Commerce Bank: Its savings department added a savings plan, where an account can be opened with a deposit of one yuan or more in national currency. After that, deposits can be made whenever there are funds, and suspended when there are no funds, regardless of the amount and regardless of how many days apart. Interest is calculated every six months and added to the principal to generate interest. If the deposit is renewed upon maturity, even more preferential treatment can be enjoyed. If there is an urgent need in the middle, a cash loan can be obtained from the bank, with the interest rate increased by 1% on top of the deposit interest rate.

(8) Fujian Provincial Bank: An agricultural affairs section was added in August.

### The Raw Material Trade of the United States

— Written by E. Janeway, Translated by Zhu Jijun

The economic power that has the deepest and most significant influence on the future internationally is the United States' monopoly on the supply of raw materials. The European crisis in September 1938 has prompted Asia to begin reducing its position as the world's main supplier of raw materials. Because the dire consequences of this crisis have amplified various forces that are forcing the world's raw material trade to transform its former face.

The main customers for the main raw materials of the Far East and Southeast Asia—silk, tungsten, antimony, rubber, tin, magnesium, manganese, etc.—are the United States, which needs more than half of the total exports. Therefore, Asia's future export trade to the world market will depend entirely on the support of the United States. The capacity of the sea lanes through which these raw materials must pass to the Western Hemisphere depends indirectly on the ability of all countries in the world to eliminate the scourge of war. For Asia's monopoly on raw material exports, war is a fatal blow.

The new crisis in the Mediterranean has made the customers of Asian raw materials deeply aware that this transportation route is no longer reliable.

Japan's seizure of Guangzhou aims to prevent China from obtaining supplies from Europe and the United States. This is a way for Japan to sanction China; it cut off Guangzhou's rear and overseas transportation. The second role of blockading Guangzhou is, of course, to blockade Hong Kong. At the same time, it makes it possible for Japan to cut off trade routes between Southeast Asia and the United States when the Mediterranean crisis intensifies and blocks another route. Once Japan controls Singapore and the passage for overseas trade, it will simply cut off the export of rubber from Southeast Asia.

The US authorities have long been aware of the importance of this situation for US industry, so they have prepared many steps in the hope of preventing this blockade. Various tin industries—steel, canning, automobile, and agricultural equipment industries—have prepared a plan to deal with emergencies. Because the tin trade is such that tin ore is not directly transported to the United States but passes through the Mediterranean in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. After it is smelted, it is transported to the United States. In this way, after paying a handling fee to the two countries that specialize in smelting ore, the tin shipped across the Atlantic to the United States is no longer tin ore but has become iron tin (like iron tin). This iron tin can be forged into tinplate.

But the US tin customers are also very worried about the precarious state of the Mediterranean (because broad tin must pass through the Mediterranean to reach European tin smelting plants), no less than the fear of the war severing Asian sources. So they raced to sign purchase contracts with tin-producing countries and agreed with the sellers to deliver as much as possible as soon as possible while peace could be maintained and the contracts were valid. What bothers them most is the fear that one day the suppliers will not be able to afford the huge orders or that production will be reduced to 20%.

Therefore, they are also planning another long-term policy to ensure peace. The first and most urgent plan is the establishment of a system to limit the export of tin scraps, which has been successful in greatly reducing the export of tin scraps this year.

The second plan is to build tin smelting plants (the United States did not have such plants in the past). They believe that the danger of relying on Asia is very great, which makes them have to eliminate another danger of relying on European tin smelting. What's more, they believe that the old-fashioned and unproductive European tin smelting plants must be replaced by modern tin smelting plants anyway.

The third plan is to add some new interests to the current US foreign policy. The United States must sign a trade agreement with Bolivia, stipulating that Bolivia can obtain the raw materials it needs from the United States in exchange for supplying the United States with tin ore as much as possible. Finally, let's mention the current situation of the US tin industry. They have achieved great success in their plan to replace tin with other metals in the automobile industry; each car now needs about two pounds of tin, while the amount required in the past was seven pounds. Automobile production, like the production of canning H industry, has always been a major problem in the United States. But since accumulating huge amounts of orders and making Bolivia its sole producer of tin, this problem caused by the new political and naval situation in Asia has been solved.

As for other raw materials, there is also a risk that the supply will be cut off. They can be divided into two categories. One category is manganese and antimony. These two raw materials do not yet have adequate substitutes and must be imported from Asia (only a small portion can be imported from Cuba and Brazil). Therefore, the US government is doing its best to build a "mineral stock" that can supply US H industry for two years without relying on foreign imports. The cost of this work is about 140 million US dollars.

The second category is various alternative raw materials. For example, barium can replace tungsten, and the United States has a lot of molybdenum raw materials. In addition, if the tariff or price of tungsten is raised, the United States can also use Chinese tungsten. As for silk, it is said that the sixth-sixth rayon newly released by Dupont is the most satisfactory substitute. Its texture is not only suitable for civilian use but also suitable for military use. The only condition necessary for manufacturing this rayon is proficiency in production technology. The situation is the same for rubber, and Mexico and Brazil are also rubber producers. In short, the method of solving the supply problem of these raw materials is to rely on huge amounts of storage on the one hand and to strive for comprehensive advances in production technology on the other.

### Grain Rice Prices High, Market Dull

Yesterday's supply of domestic rice still came from the fourth district of the lower reaches of the river, with over 3,000 packages transported by carts. Due to sufficient supplies in the market in recent days, hoarders and local sales outlets became hesitant and adopted a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a weak market. Most goods failed to trade, the market softened, and as a result, high-quality thick japonica rice remained steady, medium-grade rice decreased by 0.05 yuan, and thin indica rice was particularly sluggish, falling back by 0.1 yuan. Du sheep, pointed rice, and "bian yuan" rice also tended to remain flat as a result.

### Seafood Wenzhou Continues to Open

Wenzhou dried shrimp is continuously supplied and sells actively. Yesterday, another 66 pieces were opened, with high-end at 70 yuan, and medium-grade at 65 yuan.

### Red Jade Ginseng Stockpile is Low

The inventory of red jade ginseng is sparse, and the trend is stable. Small sizes are even more scarce, so the market price has risen by more than 10 yuan recently. For example, dragon tooth picked strips are 175 yuan to 170 yuan, number one is 152 yuan, large number two is 148 yuan, small number two is 139 yuan, number three is 131 yuan, number four is 122 yuan, small number four is 116 yuan, number five is 109 yuan, small jade is 97 yuan, frozen jade picked strips are 151.5 yuan, output is 116.6 yuan per 100 pieces, number one is 141 yuan, number two is 136 yuan, large number three is 128 yuan, small number three is 121 yuan, number four is 114 yuan, number five is 105 yuan, frozen red ginseng number one is 129 yuan, number two is 120 yuan, number three is 105 yuan, auspicious red ginseng number one is 119 yuan, number two is 107 yuan, number three is 94 yuan.

Taikoo Granulated White B Mark goods from Western warehouses were 24.4 yuan, Dutch red sugar was 16.55 yuan, unchanged. Newly arrived domestic green sugar was mostly still at 14.5 to 14.6 yuan, then a certain shop forcefully raised it to 14.8 yuan, and sold in small quantities, totaling one hundred and several tens of bags. Random foreign sugar was over one hundred bags at 16.5 yuan. Chaozhou sugar was slightly replenished, and the price lacked upward or downward movement.

### Medicinal Materials Sichuan Ginger Extremely High

Sichuan ginger, due to difficulties in supply and extreme scarcity in the market, the market price has gradually increased. It was over 50 yuan last winter, and yesterday it was reported to have risen another 5 yuan, with transactions at 55 yuan, which is more than half the increase from the lower price at the beginning. Furthermore, Jian ginger has not been shipped for a long time, so it feels even tighter.

### Fuel Firewood Supply Scarce, Local Sales Active

Recently, the supply of firewood has reportedly been hindered by winds, and few sailing ships have arrived in port. Only seven ships arrived in the lower reaches of the river yesterday, so people are expecting higher prices, and the local market has also become more active. The prices are: large size firewood is 4.5 bundles per yuan, medium size is 13 bundles per yuan, small size is 16 bundles per yuan, Bazhou long firewood is 18 bundles per yuan, small size pine firewood is 20 bundles per yuan. Transferring through the Yangjingbang canal adds to the cartage fee. It is reported that the demand for starting fires in stoves has been very high recently, and a large number of transactions have taken place.

### Sexual Hygiene German Success in Treating Kidney Deficiency with Youth Gland Extracts

Thanks to the diligent research of scientists and physiologists, it has become known that the youth gland, the most important gland in the human body, is essential for improving the human race and promoting health. If this youth gland becomes diseased, reproductive weakness occurs, leading to symptoms such as spermatorrhea and kidney deficiency. Subsequently, the reproductive system falls into a pathological state, and the health of the nation is greatly affected!

Therefore, I can confidently say that the authority of the youth gland not only dominates individual health but also affects the entire nation. The male youth gland, including the entire testicle, is an important organ for producing semen. Every male needs a special substance secreted from the testicles to flow to various parts of the body to promote physical and mental health and invigorate sexual function. The female youth gland is an important organ for ovulation. If it becomes unhealthy, it can lead to irregular menstruation, anemia, and infertility.

Regarding the tragic consequences of youth gland weakness, German medical doctor Dr. Ritzmann and renowned physiologist Mr. Hürb presented two cases of the shocking impact of youth gland dysfunction. Their records are as follows:

A 20-year-old youth, who had been masturbating since the age of 16, subsequently suffered from neurasthenia and had spermatorrhea and complete loss of sexual function. As a result, he repeatedly postponed his marriage. His entire body was completely like a child's, weighing only 88 pounds, and his brain was weak.

Another case was a 35-year-old Jew who suffered from kidney deficiency and impotence due to multiple wives, leading to a breakdown in the relationship between husband and wife. After a doctor's examination, it was confirmed that his youth gland, which was responsible for performing its function, had lost its function.

These two patients, after being treated by renowned German physician Dr. Orge Foleg M.D. with the German youth gland endocrine preparation for men, "Nutri-Com," for one week, showed amazing results. At this time, the patients immediately felt refreshed, and all symptoms of insomnia and forgetfulness completely disappeared. After taking it for seven weeks, they each gained four pounds, and their development gradually improved, completely different from before. Three months later, they both successively recovered their libido. One held his wedding as scheduled, and the other no longer had to worry about the loss of sexual power.

Therefore, the German "Nutri-Com" has been praised by scholars around the world. The female version has the effect of regulating menstruation, nourishing seeds, replenishing blood, and preserving beauty, making it a sacred medicine for gynecology.

### The Best Treatment for Spermatorrhea

— Dr. Zheng, Medical Doctor of Germany

Young people living in cities are more open-minded than those in the countryside, and they tend to pursue extravagance in everything. There is everything to enjoy in terms of entertainment. Young people are easily seduced by evil environments, which can lead to loss of vitality, reduced willpower, and masturbation. Over time, the kidney area becomes deficient, and the essence gate is damaged, leading to spermatorrhea. Therefore, the reason why urban youth are prone to spermatorrhea lies in this.

The usual treatments for spermatorrhea focus on the mental aspects, which is to require patients to strictly observe hygiene, cultivate a pure mind and few desires, reduce erotic stimulation, be careful with their diet, and avoid overwork. However, while this is effective for physiological spermatorrhea, for spermatorrhea caused by masturbation, in addition to the above-mentioned hygienic methods, one should actively take the testicular essence preparation for men, "Nutri-Com," to cultivate sexual power. Furthermore, one should also take "Naires Spermatorrhea Pills," invented by venereal disease expert Dr. Naires, to stop spermatorrhea. Taking three pills before bedtime can prevent spermatorrhea that night. In my clinical experiments, it has repeatedly shown amazing results, making it the best treatment for all types of spermatorrhea. If the body is too deficient, taking both medications together will show even more amazing effects.

### Those Suffering from Leukorrhea Should Consider Post-Marital Happiness

— Dr. Zhong Chang, Medical Doctor of the United States

Anyone who has gonorrhea that has not been cured for a long time, if they are already married, should consider that this disease is extremely easy to transmit to their beloved wife, leading to discord between husband and wife. Therefore, those suffering from gonorrhea who are fortunate enough to be unmarried should cure it in time to avoid having their secret disease discovered by their partner on their wedding night. This would cause the budding roots of love to wither and die, causing a tragedy in life. Is this not because they did not take precautions? In addition, if the symptoms of gonorrhea persist after marriage, the body's resistance will weaken day by day, and gonococci will become rampant. Therefore, gonorrhea patients often experience a worsening of symptoms after marriage, which is due to this reason.

Therefore, for the sake of future marital happiness, we must quickly and thoroughly cure this stubborn gonorrhea. However, when treating gonorrhea, do not be misled by the heavily advertised remedies in general. Only those oral medications for gonorrhea treatment that are truly effective should be chosen. If one is misled by these intentions and purposes, I fear that one will never encounter an oral medication that can cure the disease for life. Since returning to the country after studying medicine in the United States, I have focused on the treatment of gonorrhea. The "Klinon," invented by a German doctor of gonorrhea, has been proven to be tens of thousands of times more effective than general, poorly made remedies over the years. It has two special features: (1) After taking "Klinon," the cells in the body produce an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect. This effect can annihilate gonococci hidden in deep parts of the body such as joints and blood. Therefore, all new and old leukorrhea in men and women can be cured. Because it has this effect, wherever gonococci are present, the bactericidal power of "Klinon" follows. This special effect is not available in general over-the-counter remedies on the market today. (2) "Klinon" is made entirely using scientific extraction methods, so there are no side effects. It is completely different from the general sandalwood oil and cubeb-based remedies on the market that harm the digestive power of the stomach and intestines and stimulate the kidneys. Therefore, those who suffer from gonorrhea and seek to maintain marital happiness can only do so by taking "Klinon."

Gonorrhea Lecture

### Why Does Leukorrhea Persist?

Narrated by Dr. Yao Juyan Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Lacking Independent Judgement Leads to Misguidance

Hiding one's illness and avoiding medical treatment is certainly the main reason why general patients lose treatment, but lacking independent judgment and not being able to determine what kind of treatment can benefit and not harm the disease, and rashly being tempted by generally exaggerated giant advertisements, not understanding the truth, privately purchasing and taking medications in the hope of success, often leads to the opposite result. Whether a treatment is effective depends on the symptoms of gonorrhea. Gonorrhea remedies and other treatments that do not address the symptoms often cause complications, and the internal attack of gonococcal toxins is even more terrifying. In fact, gonorrhea patients are not difficult to treat in the beginning. It is only because patients lack independent judgment and are misled by exaggerated advertising, recklessly taking over-the-counter remedies, that it becomes chronic, and as a result, their wives are also infected, causing leukorrhea to increase. Therefore, even if one side is treated, it soon recurs due to sexual contact, making it even more difficult to treat.

Must Strictly Adhere to Complete Elimination of Gonorrhea

However, based on my many years of experience, with regard to married men, it is necessary to have both husband and wife treated at the same time in order to cure the disease, because this is not enough to completely eliminate gonorrhea. In terms of treatment methods, careful consideration should be given. For example, in terms of electrotherapy, the latest German invention of static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy has an unexpected effect on eliminating gonococci. If one also takes the gonorrhea-specific drug "Klinon" internally, it will exert a bactericidal power that is far-reaching and meticulous. Therefore, any difficult-to-cure gonorrhea can be successfully treated using these methods. As for women's gonococcal leukorrhea, one can also take "Klinon" internally and use "Car-Snow vaginal tablets" externally as a suppository to clear the gonococci in the vagina, and complete recovery will be achieved within days, permanently eliminating the recurrence.

Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 appointment tickets will be given out each day, with each ticket costing only 50 cents.

### Prevention and Treatment of Tuberculosis

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Nine out of ten cases of pulmonary tuberculosis are caused by chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is when the trachea is stimulated by external factors (such as wind and cold), causing coughs and increased secretions in the trachea. If the cough persists and does not heal, it will inevitably lead to pain in the lungs. The lungs are originally an insensitive organ, so the pain is caused by prolonged coughing damaging the pleura, leading to inflammation and pain. This kind of pain is different from others. It is like a needle prick. It is sometimes present and sometimes absent, or painful or hidden, and is the first sign of lung disease. One should seek treatment quickly, otherwise one will develop fever and hemoptysis. The most effective treatment is to take the lung disease-specific drug "Pulmonal." This drug not only has the effect of preventing pulmonary tuberculosis but also has the great power to replenish cells throughout the body. In the early stages of coughing, taking it will have the effect of suppressing coughs, dissolving phlegm, and treating tuberculosis.

### Various Countries Buying Chinese Ships To Expand Navigation Rights, Japanese Businesses Attempting to Monopolize Chinese Shipping and Obstructing Ships From Third Countries

Since Japanese warships blockaded our coast and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, state-owned and private-owned ships were forced to suspend navigation. Chinese ships were either sunk to serve as blockades, seized by the Japanese army, or destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The remaining ships were sold to foreign merchants. Countries such as the Soviet Union, the United States, Portugal, Greece, and Norway took the opportunity to expand their shipping businesses in China and infringe upon our navigation rights. Japanese businesses also attempted to monopolize shipping. The details are as follows:

Chinese Merchant Ships Suspend Navigation and are Sold

State-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, except for the newly built Yuanheng Lizhen series, have been sold to Jardine Matheson. Haixiang and Hairui, as well as various Yangtze River ships, are all in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Xinming, Taishun, Xinjiangtian, Tonghua, and Xinfeng have all been sunk to serve as blockades. Private Sanbei ships have been sold to Italian Zhongyi Company. Dada and Datong ships are all docked in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Huxing, Zhoushan, Taizhou, and Pingan ships have been sold to Portuguese merchants. Hefeng and other ships have been sold to Greek merchants. Huashang and other ships have been sold to Brazilian merchants. Ningshao and other ships have been sold to German merchants. Those sunk for use as blockades include Huaping and Taiping.

Foreign Merchants Expand and Infringe Upon Chinese Navigation Rights

British, American, German, Portuguese, Greek, and Brazilian merchants, after buying Chinese merchant ships, are making every effort to expand our coastal and lower Yangtze River routes, taking the opportunity to seize our navigation rights. Newly organized foreign shipping companies after the war, such as Italian Zhongyi, American Weili Han and Huamei, Portuguese Zhengde and Meili, and German Far East, in addition to German Lihe and Lulin, and Norwegian Hualun, are all engaged in shipping. Today, the routes of Ningbo, Taizhou, Wenzhou, and occasionally Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou in Zhejiang, as well as the Shanghai-Chongming-Haiqi, Shanghai-Tongyang, and North-South Ocean routes in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, have all been operated by foreign shipping companies.

Japanese Businesses Attempt to Monopolize Shipping

After the war, the Japanese company Nissin Company, subsidized by the Japanese government, controlled small inland river ships in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, seizing Chinese merchants' ships Xinhongxing, Chongming, and Tianci, renaming them to dominate the Shanghai-Chongming and Shanghai-Tong routes, preventing the opening of the Yangtze River, and monopolizing shipping. After protests from various countries were ineffective, it is now attempting to monopolize our shipping. In addition to opening the new Shanghai-Xiamen route, it is also planning to open a Nanyang line, namely the Shanghai-Xiamen-Hong Kong route. Regarding the North Ocean route Shanghai-Qingdao-Lianyungang-Yantai-Tianjin line, it is exclusively operated by Dalian Kisen Kaisha and Nissin Company. It is creating various obstacles for ships from third countries, such as unreasonable detention and inspection, which are too numerous to mention. Despite repeated negotiations by the authorities of third countries, the Japanese side remains the same.

Detaining Foreign Ships Hinders Shipping

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Japanese side is claiming to be investigating nationality and detaining ships from third countries. The ships involved include Greek Yasheng, Portuguese Wanli, Hungarian Aida, British Yongzhen, Brazilian Yongda, Portuguese Hafa, Portuguese Haida, and Greek Liwuduo. As of today, apart from Yongzhen, Yongda, Hafa, Haida, and Wanli, which have been released after protests from the consuls of various countries, Yasheng, Aida, and Liwuduo have not yet been released. In addition, the Japanese are also blocking the Jiaojiang River at Haimen in Zhejiang, not allowing foreign merchants to operate the Shanghai-Fuzhou route, repeatedly hindering the shipping industry of third countries in China.

### Again, Japanese Soldiers are Anti-War and World-Weary Three Japanese Soldiers in Xinlonghua Simultaneously Commit Suicide with Pistols

Yesterday (the 4th), three soldiers, Otani, Kikutada Saburo, and Furuta Seishiro, of the Ikeda Unit of the Japanese army in Xinlonghua in the Nanshi district, simultaneously committed suicide with pistols. The bodies have been transported to Hongkou for cremation, which is a clear indication of the strong anti-war sentiment among Japanese soldiers.

### Police Recruit Japanese Police Officers Quota is Thirty People

The Dalu News reported yesterday (the 4th) that the Japanese police force of the Public Security Bureau will soon reach its full strength. The number of Japanese personnel in the Public Security Bureau is set at 296, and the current number of Japanese police officers is 267. It is claimed that a certain Japanese Assistant Commissioner of Police in the Public Security Bureau has been ordered to go to Japan soon to recruit 30 Japanese police officers. The Public Security Bureau and the Japanese authorities reached an agreement on the evening of Friday, resulting in this move. For some time, the strength of the Japanese police force has been lower than the assigned number due to the financial difficulties of the Public Security Bureau after the war, so the force has not yet reached its full strength.

### Central Government Assists the Relocation of Factories By the End of Last Year, 138 Factories Had Started Operations in Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Other Provinces

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has sought to destroy the industrial foundation of our nation. In the areas they invaded, they tried their best to bomb them beforehand, and then wantonly seize them after they were occupied. Fortunately, our authorities planned in advance, and all those that could be relocated were relocated to safe areas as early as possible, and a Factory Relocation Management Committee was established to assist the factories in handling the relocation. By the end of 1938, the number of important industrial and mining factories and machinery that had been relocated is recorded as follows: Machinery and hardware: 64 factories, totaling 4,494.8 tons; Electrical appliances and materials: 18 factories, totaling 3,071.1 tons; Chemical industry: 22 factories, totaling 3,124.3 tons; Ceramics and glass: 5 factories, totaling 32.0 tons; Culture and printing: 12 factories, totaling 1,678.5 tons; Textile industry: 7 factories, totaling 7,788.8 tons; Shipbuilding industry: 4 factories, totaling 172.8 tons; Coal mining industry: 2 factories, totaling 3,600.0 tons; Other industries: 4 factories, totaling 357.4 tons. A total of 138 factories, 24,918.7 tons. Most of the above factories have been moved to the western parts of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hunan provinces.

### Zhejiang Cotton Shipped to Shanghai Ministry of Finance Re-Prohibits Shipments with Existing Documents Still Allowed for Export

The Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs, in order to prevent national products from aiding the enemy, had previously stipulated 54 types of local products to be prohibited from being transported to occupied areas, and Shanghai was also considered an area controlled by Japanese forces, so it was also banned. The Zhejiang Customs was ordered to comply. Subsequently, the chambers of commerce and various industries in Shanghai and Ningbo sent telegrams requesting approval, and the authorities approved cotton, paper, eggs, bamboo, wood, tea, and other six types to be allowed to be transported to Shanghai, provided that the relevant chambers of commerce and trade associations were responsible for providing proof before they could be released. After receiving this order, various industries prepared the necessary documents and transported cotton and other goods stored in Ningbo to Shanghai by ships such as Moufu, Deping, Tangsai, and Meida. According to news from Ningbo, the Ministry of Finance believes that cotton is a military raw material, and if there are no restrictions on exports, abuses are inevitable, so it has decided to re-prohibit it. Those who have prepared the necessary documents and have not yet shipped the goods are still allowed to ship them, but no further requests will be accepted, and the Zhejiang Customs has been ordered to comply.

### Shanghai Market Rice Prices Rise to the Limit Bean and Rice Industry to Convene Meeting Today to Discuss the Issue of Rice Price Control

The supply of rice in Shanghai has been affected by the direct procurement by the Japanese puppet regime from the production areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, resulting in a gradual depletion of stocks in the interior and rising prices. For example, the price of rice in Wuxi has risen to 12.6 yuan. If it is to be transported to Shanghai, a transportation fee of 1.5 yuan must be added, so the cost per picul has reached 14.1 yuan. As a result, the price of the number one rice in the soybean and rice market yesterday morning has risen to 14 yuan, and the black market price has exceeded the limit price. The Market Management Committee has made every effort to stabilize the market, but various vendors have been forced to stop selling due to the soaring prices in the production areas. The daily arrival of rice in Shanghai has been about 2,000 to 3,000 bags, while the daily requirement of the two concessions is at least 7,000 bags (about 9,000 piculs based on 1.25 dou per picul). Fortunately, the concessions have 650,000 bags of rice in stock, so there is no shortage panic in Shanghai for the time being, but stabilizing prices is not easy. Moreover, glutinous rice has risen to 17 yuan per picul, and the retail price of number one rice in various rice shops has exceeded 14 yuan. Therefore, the Soybean and Rice Industry Association will convene a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at 3:00 PM today to discuss everything. It is rumored that at this meeting, some rice merchants will propose raising the limit price of 14 yuan, but this move concerns the food supply of the entire city, and the Soybean and Rice Industry, which is responsible for regulating the food supply, should handle it properly. At the same time, the Rice and Grain Joint Management Committee organized by the concession authorities will also be reluctant to allow the increase.

### The Shanghai-Taiwan Line to Resume Soon; Registration of the "Hana Hai Fu" Completed; Jiaojiang Estuary Still Blockaded and on Alert

The port of Haimen, Zhejiang, has been blockaded since the bombardment by Japanese warships, causing the Shanghai-Taiwan shipping line to be suspended for half a month. The shipping industry association requested permission from the authorities to resume operations, which has been granted. Vessel registration has been implemented, and ships such as the "Hana Hai Fu," which originally sailed the Shanghai-Taiwan route, have complied with the registration procedures. Once approved by the authorities, the route can be resumed. Currently, Jiaojiang remains under blockade with strict security measures.

### Yuan Order Continues Ban on Export of Millet and Wheat; Orders Issued to Provincial Governments to Instruct Subordinates to Comply

The Executive Yuan, in order to continue the ban on wheat exports, has sent telegrams to various provincial governments, ordering them to instruct their subordinates to comply. According to a joint telegram from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the proposal to continue banning the export of wheat and wheat-containing millet has been approved and orders have been issued to comply.

### French Electric Company Increases Electricity Prices; Electricity Up 15%, Power Up 25%

Following repeated price increases by the Shanghai Waterworks Company and the Shanghai Power Company in the Public Concession, the Shanghai French Electric Company, also due to exchange rate issues, has decided to raise prices starting today. The announcement is as follows: "Regarding the electricity price increase for the company's customers, the French Concession Municipal Council approved the price list at a meeting on February 28th. Effective March 6, 1939 (Western calendar), electricity prices for lighting users will temporarily increase by 15%, and prices for power and electric heating users will increase by 25%. This is hereby announced."

### Municipal Council's Police Authority Remains Intact; Police Cooperate with Japanese Military Police; Large-Scale Searches Continue

The "China Press" reports that, regarding the Japanese announcement on the recent talks between the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities, it should be clarified that the Council retains its full police powers. According to the Land Regulations, no party other than the Municipal Council's Police Department may conduct independent police actions within the Public Concession. Any cooperation must be approved and arranged by the Chief of Police.

The "Continental Daily News" reports that as a result of the agreement reached between the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities two days ago, the Police Department retains its police power within the Public Concession. The Police Department yesterday (the 4th) discussed with personnel from the Japanese Military Police the standard methods for preventing terrorist incidents. Although no announcement was issued after the meeting, it is understood that the steps already taken to prevent terrorist incidents will not undergo major changes.

It is also heard that incidents involving the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities caused by terrorist activities are now mostly handled by non-diplomatic personnel. Now that the Council and the Japanese side have signed an agreement, diplomatic work has at least temporarily ceased. Everything is now handled by the Police Department and the Japanese Military Police. However, it is reported that all steps taken by the Council will be notified to the Consular Body at any time. Municipal Council administrative personnel, the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai, and embassy personnel, as well as all the lane streets in the Public Concession,

The work of setting up barbed wire fences continued yesterday. This work has now reached the Western District. Some lane streets beside roads outside the boundary are currently being blockaded. Police patrols continue in all areas of the city. Search teams in the Central District, the Old Zha District, and the Western District will continue to conduct large-scale searches for some time. According to the Public Concession Police Authority, although no

Terrorist crimes have occurred in over a week, they have no intention of easing security. The British West Yorkshire Regiment continued to patrol Nanjing Road yesterday, and other British troops were seen patrolling in the Western District. The number of British patrols in the French-controlled town of Fahua, where armed bandits are hiding, has been increased.

### British Ambassador to China, Lady Kerr, Goes to America; Expected to Return to Shanghai in Early Autumn

Lady Kerr, wife of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has been in Shanghai for several months and is deeply concerned about refugee children. Last year, she helped raise funds for the "Orphan Hospital" at the Great Guangming Theater. Lady Kerr personally collected over 10,000 yuan. Her kindness is admirable. It is now known that Lady Kerr returned to her hometown of Los Angeles, USA, by ship at 4:00 PM on the 4th. After a short stay there, she will travel to Chile en route. Lady Kerr is expected to return to Shanghai this summer or early autumn.

### Zhejiang Trade Commission Stipulates Export Standards for Tea Chests

The Zhejiang Provincial Trade Commission, in order to regulate tea chests exported to Hong Kong, has stipulated four standards and issued a notice to the tea inspection offices in Ningbo and Wenzhou, instructing them to forward the information to all tea merchants for compliance. The measures are as follows: (1) The four corners of the chest must be joined in a sawtooth pattern; (2) Twelve dried wooden strips should be nailed inside the chest. However, for maple boxes with a thickness of 0.3 inches (Chinese measurement) or more, or fir boxes with a thickness of 0.4 inches or more, two wooden strips each may be reduced from the top and bottom of the box; (3) The inner wall of lead-lined boxes should still be lined with strong, clean paper to completely isolate the tea from the lead; (4) The outside of the box should indicate the type of tea, trademark, number of pieces, gross weight, net weight (new standard), tea farm number and location, and harvest/production period.

### Large Numbers of Postal Workers Transferred Out; Post Office's Situation Increasingly Difficult; Oppression from a Certain Quarter Intensifies Daily

According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Shanghai Postal Administration, although Shanghai's postal administration still maintains its integrity, oppression from a certain quarter is intensifying daily. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, significant changes in the Post Office include the addition of a Japanese postal director assistant, the addition of a Japanese chief inspector, the implementation of mail inspection, the cessation of the sale of the National Government Ministry of Finance stamps, the restoration of the Beijing-Shanghai airmail service, and the collection of Shanghai-Hankou, Shanghai-Beijing, Shanghai-Guangdong, and Shanghai-Hangzhou telegram fees, etc. Recently, due to the increasingly deteriorating environment, a large number of postal workers will be transferred out of Shanghai, and the future of the Shanghai Post Office is of particular concern.

### Japanese Troops Suddenly Invade Haiyan; Garrison Fights Bravely; Guerrilla Forces Have Reached the Outskirts of Jiaxing; Ding Xishan's Troops Defend Zhuangjiahang; Fierce Battle at Ye Xie; Zhang Yan Recovered

Haiyan, Zhejiang Province, which was recovered by guerrilla forces, has been invaded by Japanese troops several times, all without success. On the 5th, they concentrated their forces from Jiaxing and other places and launched a surprise attack on Haiyan. The local garrison also fought bravely, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. The situation there is still chaotic. Guerrilla forces in Jiashan, Jiaxing, and other places have also risen up in response, attacking the Japanese rear. The Japanese troops in Jiaxing and other places have been largely transferred away, leaving them weak, relying only on the city walls for defense. The guerrilla forces have reached the outskirts of the city, established strongholds, and are about to launch an attack.

Japanese Troops Retreat from Ye Xie: According to people from Minhang, six warships of the Japanese navy from Minhang, carrying more than 500 soldiers, together with the Japanese troops from Mishi Ferry, sailed to Ye Xie to attack the guerrilla force led by Li Zhiming. A fierce battle broke out, lasting from morning to night. The Japanese suffered over a hundred casualties, and the remaining enemy retreated in panic. Over a hundred Japanese bodies were transported the next day to near Beiqiao in Shanghai County for cremation. Li's troops suffered some losses.

Intense Fighting at Nanqiao

Nanqiao, Fengxian County, has been occupied for half a month. Guerrilla forces under Ding Xishan and Li Zhiming have been reinforced and surrounded the area for days. On the night of the 3rd, another fierce battle occurred, with gunfire and artillery fire throughout the night. The Chinese army is currently employing a strategy of containment and attrition. When the mission is completed, they retreat at dawn. The Japanese troops use daylight to divide into teams and travel by motorboat in the Hengli Jing and Nanqiao Port rivers that run through the Pu River, rushing east and west, hoping to break through to the Japanese troops besieged in Tinglin via Zhuangjiahang Shengzimiao along Nanqiao Port. However, they were unable to pass through Zhuangjiahang, which was defended by Ding's troops.

Zhang Yan Rural Areas Affected by Disaster

According to people from Zhujing, Zhangyan Town on the Songjiang-Jinshan border was invaded on the 1st of this month by 150 Japanese troops, traveling by more than ten motorboats and carrying guns and artillery. They charged directly into Gaoni Jing Denmu from the waterways of Punan Ye Xie Tang and Zhangze Estuary, and attacked Zhang Town. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese, fearing their rear would be cut off, retreated to the Songyin area behind Houtang. Zhangyan Town has been recovered by Ding Xishan's troops. As the Japanese retreated, they burned down more than ten villages, leaving hundreds of farmers homeless.

### Commanders of Various Countries' Defense Forces Agree to Cooperate with the Japanese Side; Continue to Provide Assistance at the Request of the Japanese Side

The "China Press" reports that the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities have recently reached an understanding to cooperate in curbing terrorist activities in the Public Concession and areas outside the boundary. Subsequently, the commanders of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai also notified the Japanese authorities yesterday (the 4th) that they would continue to provide assistance. This information was revealed by the Japanese navy spokesman when the Japanese side received reporters yesterday, regarding the visit of Japanese military police officers to the military commanders of Britain, the United States, and Italy, and the authorities of the police department.

In the announcement, the spokesman claimed that when the Japanese officers visited the commanders, they informed them that the Japanese authorities and the Municipal Council had reached an understanding, and stated the Japanese side's views on this matter, and requested the understanding and cooperation of the garrison forces in fighting the recent terrorist incidents. The commanders of the garrison forces then congratulated the Japanese officers on the successful conclusion of the recent negotiations, and said that they would fully cooperate to maintain peace and order in Shanghai. This expression of goodwill, in the form of a willingness to cooperate with the Japanese army and the Council, was deeply

Appreciated by the Japanese side. Under these circumstances, the Japanese authorities expect to effectively maintain peace and order in Shanghai, so that the situation in the city is clearer, and hope that this spirit of cooperation between the Japanese side and third countries will continue to expand and overcome other difficulties. This is the view of the Japanese army and navy. A reporter asked whether the Japanese authorities felt that the Council had not cooperated in the past. The spokesman replied that he had not said so, but that the cooperation of the transformed party should be expanded. All previous meetings were held with the utmost sincerity.

The spokesman replied that the cooperation between the two parties was extended only to the Public Concession, or also to the area outside the boundary controlled by the Japanese side. In the past, the Japanese army would conduct methods of maintaining peace in the boundary area outside the Public Concession. However, the issue of improving the control of shipping to and from the Huangpu River was also discussed. The spokesman claimed that the news in the local newspapers that the Public Concession police would be able to enter the Japanese-controlled area to arrest armed criminals was inaccurate.

### Residents of Huaiyin Begin to Evacuate; War in Northern Jiangsu Breaks Out; Six Japanese Planes Circle Over Funing; Japanese Warships Spy on Haimen, Fierce Fighting Occurs

According to news from the shipping industry in this city, fierce fighting is currently underway in northern Jiangsu. The Chinese army has sent large numbers of reinforcements and is actively launching a counterattack, making considerable progress. Han Deqin, acting chairman of Jiangsu Province, is leading his troops to resist efforts and is also launching mobile warfare to attack the Japanese rear. Residents of Huaiyin have begun to evacuate because fighting has occurred near the city. It is also reported that yesterday morning, two teams of Japanese planes, a total of six aircraft, circled over Funing and then flew towards Huaiyin. In addition, since Nantong Tianshenggang in northern Jiangsu was occupied by the Japanese, the northern Jiangsu region has used that location as a hub for passengers and goods. The Japanese have long coveted that area and have attacked it repeatedly, all without success. On the 3rd of this month, more than 100 Japanese troops were sent from Nantong to attack. Upon hearing the news, the guerrilla forces there sent troops to intercept them, and a fierce battle broke out. After the guerrilla forces resisted bravely, advancing wave upon wave, the Japanese made no progress. On the morning of the 4th, two Japanese warships sailed to the port of Haimen, and small motorboats patrolled and spied, seemingly with intentions. All ports have now stepped up their defenses, and shipping is still normal, but the inspection of passenger and goods traffic is quite strict.

### Sending Domestic and Foreign Parcels Must Follow Prescribed Procedures; Do Not Place Them Here and There at Random; To Avoid Disorder

Due to traffic congestion in various places and inconvenience of transportation, small parcels to be sent to domestic and foreign locations are piled up like mountains. In order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and facilitate the transportation of goods to other places, the Shanghai Post Office is still trying its best to find ways to transport them. However, because many senders are not familiar with the parcel sending procedures, they often place the parcels to be sent here and there, wandering around the post office without a clue. According to the person in charge of the bureau, in the future, all sectors of society must follow the procedures stipulated by the post office when sending domestic and foreign parcels, and must not place them here and there at random to avoid disorder. The foreign parcel sending procedures are recorded below:

Overseas: (1) Fill out the required forms; (2) Go to the Customs Inspection Office and hand the parcel to the customs officer for inspection; (3) Go to the Customs Declaration Registration Office to retrieve the forms; (4) Please refer to the attached diagram to identify which counter the parcel to be sent should be handed to, and then hand it to the weighing officer at that counter for weighing; (5) Go to the stamp window to purchase the required stamps and stick them firmly on the parcel package; (6) Hand the parcel together with the tax bill, etc., to the receiving officer at the original weighing place for sending; (7) If the parcel is subject to customs duties, you must first pay the tax at the customs duty payment office and obtain a tax payment receipt; (8) Go to the receipt collection office to collect the parcel receipt; (9) The sender must not leave the counter before paying the tax and obtaining the parcel receipt; (10) If there is anything else that is unclear, please inquire at the information desk.

### Prices in Japan Soar; Anti-War Sentiment Increases Daily; People's Resentment Reaches a Boiling Point; University Students Find It Difficult to Make Ends Meet

Dissenting Elements Are Often Arrested

Yesterday, the "China Press" published a London dispatch from February, one section of which stated that, according to a Hong Kong reporter for the "Daily People's Voice," travelers arriving in Hong Kong from Japan are deeply moved by the increasing anti-war sentiment in Japan. They claim that in recent weeks, Japanese police stations have arrested a large number of people who have complained about the war due to war-weariness. These people complain about the heavy taxes and the exorbitant cost of living, but of course the newspapers do not carry a word about these situations. Regarding the failure of the Japanese authorities' movement to influence Wu Peifu (Wu's declaration is full of high-sounding rhetoric, which can be regarded as a current humorous talk), the reporters all said that the Japanese would not hesitate to pay any huge reward to any Chinese leader who could launch a mass movement to make Japan end the war as soon as possible.

Students Can't Maintain Their Lives

The "Shanghai Times" states that under the pressure of the current situation in Tokyo, all kinds of prices have soared, and students are affected by this, writing to their parents, all complaining bitterly and asking for more remittances. The average standard of living for students has increased by 20%. According to a 1934 survey, the average monthly expenses for 5,000 students at Tokyo Imperial University were 9.65 yen for rent, 16.57 yen for food, 8.92 yen for research expenses, 4.80 yen for entertainment expenses, and 8.67 yen for miscellaneous expenses. As a result of this war, taking the price of leather shoes as an example, it has almost doubled. A set of uniforms has risen from around 22 yen to 28 yen, and an overcoat has risen from 32 yen to 44 yen. The average monthly food expenses have increased by about 2.5 yen compared to before the war. Only rent is similar to the summer of 1923, but everyone believes that rent will inevitably rise sooner or later like other price increases. According to a survey conducted by Tokyo Imperial University last November, the monthly living expenses for its students are about 60 yen.

The Greatest Happiness is Doing Good

### Supporting National Products; Money Shops Provide Credit Loans; Market Resumes Afternoon Session Today; Exchange Extended to 4 PM

After various money shops and currency exchange shops resumed trading after closing accounts, the Money Industry Association extended the time for negotiable instruments, resumed the afternoon market session, held an annual meeting on the 9th, publicly worshiped former directors, provided as much credit lending as possible, and supported the development of national products. The following is a record of public sentiment:

Money Market Resumes Afternoon Session

The money industry association's market originally had a morning session (9:00 AM) and an afternoon session (12:00 PM). After the war, due to a sharp decline in the clearance of negotiable instruments, the afternoon session was canceled, and there was only a morning session at 9:00 AM every day, announcing the daily discount rates. Now, because order in the concession has been restored and the clearance of negotiable instruments is gradually recovering, the Market Committee has decided to resume the afternoon session starting today. The following is a record of the market announcement: "The afternoon session will resume on March 6th."

Negotiable Instrument Exchange Ends at 4 PM

After the money industry established the negotiable instrument exchange, it handled the exchange of negotiable instruments between peers in the Ningbo Road market from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM every day. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. The total amount of exchange has gradually increased, and the exchanged negotiable instruments are divided into remittances and clearings. Now, after a committee resolution, the negotiable instrument exchange between peers will be extended to 4:00 PM starting from March 1st. As for the bank negotiable instrument clearing house, it will continue to collect money industry negotiable instruments as usual.

Money Shops Provide Credit Loans

Various national products factories and businesses in the concession, in view of the tightening of credit loans by various banks after the war, which prevented the national products industry from developing as much as possible, have requested the money industry to restore credit loans and support the development of the national products industry. It is heard that the money industry has granted the request. After resuming trading, various banks will provide as much credit lending as possible. However, for the sake of caution, a collateral system will be adopted. Therefore, various banks will provide credit loans to national products industry factories

The Money Industry Holds a Meeting to Publicly Worship Former Directors

After closing accounts, a total of forty-one money shops (remittance banks) resumed trading. The newly opened money shop is Sen Tai Zhuang, with a capital of 12,000 yuan, joining as a Zhen-character-numbered shop. Also, Zhen-character-numbered shop Hong Kang Xing Ji Zhuang has been changed to a Heng-character-numbered shop after resuming trading. In addition, the Money Industry Association has scheduled the annual meeting of the Northern Shanghai Money Industry at 9:00 AM on March 9th at the Northern Shanghai Money Industry Association Hall, publicly worshiping former directors. Managers of various banks are required to attend.

Hongxiang Dunyu Completes Liquidation

The remittance banks that voluntarily closed down and completed liquidation are: (1) Dunyu Tai Ji; (2) Hongxiang Yu Ji. The managers of these two banks have respectively handled the liquidation. Depositors have been notified to go to collect their deposits within a limited time, with interest calculated up to February 18th, and paid in full in one lump sum. As for loans, personnel have been dispatched separately to collect them. All employees, except for a few who remain to handle the liquidation, have been given severance pay and dismissed.

### Huzhou Flights Resume; Conditions Along the Way Are Still Not Peaceful; Pinghu Flights Scheduled to Resume in June

The Shanghai-Huzhou inland river flights, which were suspended due to the chaotic situation there, have been suspended for more than a month. They resumed their first flight yesterday. However, the conditions along the way are still not peaceful, so only cargo is carried for the time being, and passengers are not yet being carried. Pinghu flights are also scheduled to resume on the 6th, stopping at Chuanlai Miao and Songjiang along the way.

### Zhejiang Property Adjustment Office Reduced and Merged; Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office Established; Cooperation Work Team and Wholesale Department Established; Central and Local Cooperation in Business Operations

In order to adjust the wartime property adjustment agencies in Zhejiang Province, simplify their system, concentrate their powers, and increase administrative efficiency, the Provincial Government specifically proposed and resolved at its 1048th meeting to abolish the Wartime Property Adjustment Committee and merge the Wartime Property Adjustment Office into the Construction Department. The functions and powers of the office are stipulated as the supervision and promotion of cooperation, the guidance and management of agricultural finance, and the adjustment of the production and sales of special products, etc. All district branches and county offices are abolished. All administrative matters are handled by the commissioner's offices of various districts and county governments. The import and export goods inspection office is directly under the Construction Department. The Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office is established to manage the purchase, transportation, sales, and processing of vegetable oil, tea, cotton, silk, and cocoons, etc., in order to promote exports. A wartime cooperation work team is established to universally develop the province's cooperative undertakings. A cooperative wholesale department is established to operate wholesale businesses for cooperative societies at all levels in order to promote the development of cooperative societies and mutual assistance. The expenses of the above-mentioned agencies will not exceed the budget approved by the Wartime Property Adjustment Office. The Adjustment Office is divided into three groups, and the Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office is divided into four departments: Tung Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk. The director of the Adjustment Office will also serve as the director of the Management Office. It is heard that the candidates have been internally determined and will be submitted to the provincial government meeting for approval and appointment. The various businesses under the jurisdiction of the Management Office are planned to be operated in cooperation with the central government. Administrative management, etc., will be under the province, while the central government will be responsible for allocating funds for expenses.

### Sino-Japanese War: Prospects for Far Eastern Finance (Part 2) - Speech by the Chairman of HSBC at the Annual Meeting

Shanghai Gradually Turns to Prosperity After the Calamity

Due to its circumstances, Shanghai cannot but yield somewhat to the new situation. However, from the surface, there is little change this year. Although the Yangtze River, its only lifeline, has been cut off, imports and exports have shown a marked turnaround in recent months compared to the first few months of 1938. The number of residents in the so-called safety zone in Shanghai, although perhaps not more than before, is certainly comparable to those residing in the public concessions, French concessions, and Chinese areas. Moreover, industry is booming in the Western District under the Shanghai Municipal Council, with spinning mills, silk weaving factories, and paper mills emerging one after another. This development has overwhelmed the Municipal Council and companies providing electricity and gas. As for the Japanese-controlled area north of the Suzhou Creek, there is little to report to you, gentlemen, except for a small number of factories. Only a few thousand Chinese have returned there. But on the whole, the situation in this area is no different from last year. There is still no sign of reconstruction in the burned and bombed war zones. Unfortunately, negotiations between the Shanghai Public Concession authorities and the Japanese Navy and Army authorities stationed in Shanghai have made no progress. I can only reiterate what the Chairman said last year: the powers should now assist the Municipal Council pending resolution of various issues.

China's Organizational Threads are Strong

Any tourist traveling from China to Japan will be surprised that Japan seems to be completely unaffected by the war. In fact, the country is increasingly affected by the war day by day. The value of the Japanese yen is sometimes slightly higher than the Chinese legal tender, and sometimes only the same as the Chinese legal tender. Japan is indeed a well-organized country, and its government structure is extremely sound. Given the country's current situation, it would be a mistake to think that its endurance is insufficient. Whether the country's environment will change in the future depends on the progress of its politics. China's disorganized structure is absolutely different from Japan's organized one. However, China's organizational threads are very strong. This advantage is truly unexpected. Chinese people have elastic qualities, so it is not easy to break them. In our observation of the economic situation of the two countries, we should not overemphasize this aspect. Under the current social conditions, even Europe has no right to question Asian problems, even though budget tables, national debt currency circulation, and reserve statistics show the opposite state. Even the most solemn authorities often misjudge these issues. The relationship between "Manchuria" and Japan is "closer year by year, so I do not want to say anything more about other issues, except to draw your attention to the trade agreement it has established with Germany. This trade agreement will inevitably seize the trade of other countries. However, what is most noteworthy is that the value of goods purchased from the United States is higher than before, as it is a large amount of raw materials for the military industry.

Hong Kong is Not Threatened by War

Hong Kong is a tax-free port, and many foreign goods are transshipped to mainland China via Hong Kong. This year is the same as in the past, and the trade situation is erratic. The fall of Guangzhou and the blockade of other ports in South China have certainly affected merchants, but not enough to threaten ordinary merchants. Let us wait and see how the changes will be this year. Fortunately, Hong Kong's currency and financial situation is still very stable, so we all have full confidence to deal with the future situation. As for the trade and financial situation in the Philippines, 1938 was slightly worse than before, but it is extremely optimistic for the coming year, as gold production and non-ferrous metal goods are showing signs of recovery. This is very beneficial to the island's economic outlook. Regarding the island's independence, those who advocated independence from the United States before 1946 have now changed their strategy due to the Sino-Japanese War. As for the Malay Archipelago, its situation has been bleak since September 1937. There was no progress in 1938. Trade figures have proven that the trade situation this year is not good, not that the liquidity of the banks is excessive. The prosperity of Malaya originally depended on rubber and tin. Since 1938, the output of these two items has declined, and their average value has also decreased. Stock prices have continued to fall. Its future destiny will be no different from the past, which depends on the demand in the United States.

The Prolonged War Concerns the World

If Indian commerce is in decline, then the export industry is even more tragic. In April of last year, the Reserve Bank of India lowered its purchase rate of foreign exchange, and the foreign exchange market underwent a significant change. The impact of this weakened the foreign exchange market. Only after the Indian government issued a strong statement declaring the maintenance of the exchange value of the rupee (Indian currency) was it able to prevent speculators from attacking the market. Finally, I would like to make some further comments on the situation in the Far East. In recent years, the relationship between China and Japan has gone from rupture to war. Unfortunately, the war has not yet ended, and the situation is now turbulent and dangerous. Unless mediation is tried quickly, the rift will become irreparable. For merchants of all countries, they certainly hope that the war will end soon, but for the millions of people struggling with power, it is a matter of survival. At this moment, it is not appropriate to describe in detail the current situation of hundreds and thousands of square miles being ravaged, as well as the cruel situation suffered by the war-stricken people who are still suffering before the war stops. I only hope that the rulers of the two countries can keep this situation in mind and not lightly let go of any opportunity for mediation, not only to solve the general problem of the suffering people, but also to enable the commerce between China and Japan to return to natural expansion through peaceful means, which is beneficial to the whole world.

### A Young Woman Was Raped by Robbers on Her Way Home to Get Married - Her Wedding Ornaments Were Also Robbed - She Committed Suicide by Jumping into the River Out of Shame and Anger

Dan Guiying, a woman from Taicang, is eighteen years old and has a beautiful appearance. She has already been betrothed to someone. She came to Shanghai to escape the war. She has been in close contact with her fiancé. Recently, after an agreement between the parents of both parties, she will return to her hometown this month to get married. A few days ago, Guiying purchased all the ornaments and clothes used in the wedding in Shanghai. She carried them herself and walked back to her hometown to prepare for the wedding. Unexpectedly, when she walked to a remote place at the junction of the Chinese and French concessions at the end of Dachun Road in western Shanghai, she suddenly encountered robbers.

They Robbed Her on the Road - All the money, clothes, ornaments, and packages she was carrying were robbed. After being robbed, Guiying did not delay because the wedding was approaching, so she still returned to her hometown alone. Unexpectedly, misfortune did not come singly. When she walked to a place about fifteen miles away from her home in the countryside, she encountered four or five foreigners who stopped her and forcibly took her to the fields.

They Gang-Raped Her - After the incident, the foreigners left. Dan Guiying suffered this great humiliation and had no face to go home, so she turned back to Shanghai. She planned to visit her fiancé on the upper floor of the Jiufeng Rice Store at 77 Baike Road to tell him about the humiliation she had suffered on the road and planned to postpone the wedding. However, her fiancé had already returned to his hometown to proceed with the wedding, so the two could not meet. Dan Guiying felt all kinds of stimuli and

Committed Suicide - At 0:30 pm yesterday, she went to the Bund outside the French Concession's 16th pier alone and committed suicide by jumping into the river to wash away her shame. Fortunately, she was spotted by a boatman who quickly rescued her and handed her over to a patrolling policeman who took her to the Xiaodongmen Police Station. After the police chief inquired about the situation, he sent her to the International First Reception Center on Masnan Road for temporary placement because she had no relatives in Shanghai, and waited for her family to come to Shanghai to take her back.

### Five Cases of Women Committing Suicide

Gu Chen, a local woman, is 25 years old and lives at 49 Ruihua Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession. At about 10:00 am yesterday, she had a quarrel with her husband, Gu Jinquan, over trivial family matters. Afterwards, she secretly swallowed a large amount of opium smoke and committed suicide. She was discovered by her family and immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. She was deeply poisoned and her life was in danger.

Qin Wang, a local woman (23 years old), a guest at Room 23 of the Xinxinxiangji Hotel at 114 Zhengjia Wooden Bridge Street, suddenly secretly swallowed a three-dollar gold ring at about 8:00 am yesterday in an attempt to commit suicide. She was later discovered by a waiter who immediately reported it to the police station, and an ambulance was dispatched to take her to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the reason for the suicide was a quarrel between husband and wife.

Zhu Xiaomei, a woman from Luodian, is 21 years old and has been working as a servant at Yu's residence at 194 Lane 5, Meibaige Road, Public Concession. The woman suddenly had thoughts of death for some reason at 8:00 am yesterday and secretly swallowed poisonous potion to commit suicide. After she was discovered, the police station was informed and an investigation was dispatched. The poisoner was taken to the hospital for treatment. Because she took too much poison, her life may be in danger.

Niu Hong, a woman living at 24 Yangzi Village, Yidingpan Road, had a quarrel with her family and secretly swallowed poisonous potion to commit suicide at about 1:30 pm yesterday. She was discovered by her family who quickly called an ambulance to take her to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.

He Wang, a woman living upstairs at a certain number in Cian Lane, Ningbo Road, is 26 years old. Several years ago, she met a man named He who falsely claimed that he had not yet married, so she rented a house to live with him. The woman repeatedly urged He to hold a wedding ceremony, but he kept delaying it. Until recently, she learned that He was already married and had recently disappeared. He Wang had thoughts of ending her life due to her bad experience and difficult life. At 4:50 pm yesterday, she secretly swallowed raw opium smoke in an attempt to commit suicide. She was discovered by her neighbors who quickly called an ambulance to take her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, she did not take it for long and her life was not in danger.

### A Drug Trafficking Organization Was Cracked Down on Maixi Ai Road

The French Concession Police Department received a confidential report the day before yesterday that Koreans had set up an organization to sell drugs such as morphine and heroin at 4 Lane 271, Maixi Ai Road. They immediately ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the address to search. They seized 232 grams of morphine and arrested the owner of the organization, a Korean, on the spot. After questioning and registering him, they sent the Korean and the drugs to the competent Japanese consulate for interrogation.

### A Young Man Was Cut and Injured

At 0:45 am yesterday, a man named Zhou Zhixin (living in Xiangfu Lane, Kader Road) was suddenly stabbed in the head and arms with a knife by his enemy Wang Qi at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Weihaiwei Road in the Public Concession. He bled profusely and fainted on the ground. The murderer fled wildly. The patrolling police heard the alarm and rushed to the scene and quickly took the injured person to the hospital. However, the murderer had already disappeared without a trace.

### The Trial of the Case of Poisoning the Foster Mother to Death Has Concluded - The Chemical Analysis of the Medicine Jar and Autopsy Found No Evidence of Guilt - The Girl Yu Zhen Confessed the Process of Her Mother Administering the Medicine - The Zhuang Family Claimed to Be Falsely Accused and Will Be Sentenced on the 11th

Zhuang, the wife of Qian Wenbiao, an employee of the British American Tobacco Company, was sued for secretly putting Athilin tablets into the medicine jar at 146 Dexing Lane, Peng Road, and poisoning her 60-year-old foster mother, Zhuang Xu. When the First Special District Court continued to open the court at the end of last month, Gu Cai, the aunt and daughter of the deceased who was listening in the court, suddenly became abnormal and spoke nonsense. At that time, some people even said that it was the soul of the wronged who was possessed and prayed to her to transfer to the defendant during the next hearing to show her divine power. However, the case was reopened by Judge Huang at the Criminal Court No. 3 the morning before yesterday.

A Trial Was Held - Gu Cai was also listening in the court and showed no signs of abnormality. When someone asked Gu Cai about the situation on that day, she could not answer. The result of the chemical analysis report from the lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Police Department and the doctor of the Chemical Testing Office of the Public Works Department stated that no residual poison was found in the medicine jar, and the forensic autopsy of the body also did not find any poisonous substances. It is a pity that the deceased

The Bladder Has Rotted - Otherwise, the examination could still be carried out, etc. In court, the defendant Qian Zhuang was questioned. According to her confession, the cough medicine her mother took was decocted by her. At that time, Yu Zhen was not by her side. She was actually framed by Gu Cai. When the coffin was being prepared at the Central Funeral Home, Gu Cai forced her to sign a statement stating that the 2,400 yuan left by the deceased and other properties were all taken care of by the Gu family. She was accused because she did not agree. As for her daughter Yu Zhen, she was also hated by her because she was usually very strict. She

Initially Admitted Out of Anger - that she secretly put medicine tablets, etc. When asked the woman's daughter Yu Zhen, she confessed that when her mother was decocting the medicine, she saw her take out something from her pocket and put it into the medicine jar. After her grandmother took it, she slept until midnight. I got up to urinate and saw that her face had changed. At that time, my mother urged me to sleep quickly and turned off the lights. I knew that my grandmother had died at about 4 o'clock, etc. Gu Cai, as a witness, filed a case to prove the defendant's usual romantic behavior and repeated private taking of the deceased's property. Regarding

The Point of Murder - The woman claimed that she was informed by the defendant's daughter Yu Zhen, and the defendant also admitted it at the funeral home and was willing to use all the 2,400 yuan of inheritance for funeral expenses, sign the document, and kneel to beg not to report it to the police station, etc. However, the defendant finally confessed that she was actually framed by Gu Cai and hired a lawyer to appear in court to debate with the lawyer of the police department. Judge Huang ordered the defendant to be returned to prison and scheduled to be sentenced on the morning of the 11th of this month.

### 56 Bales of Cotton Yarn in the Xinhua Warehouse - The Police Department Implemented the Seizure - The Cotton Yarn Was Stolen from the Guerrilla Area - One Person Involved Was Arrested and Sent to the Court for Interrogation

The Xinhua Warehouse on Gansu Road on the north bank of Suzhou Creek has 56 bales of cotton yarn worth more than 10,000 yuan. The Chinese Deputy Detective Yao Yuanlong and Western Detective Tanler of the Huisi Police Department under its jurisdiction investigated and found that the cotton yarn was stolen from a certain yarn factory in the guerrilla area and recently transported to Shanghai. However, the person who received the stolen goods has disappeared. It is urgent to first put forward and preserve the stolen yarn to avoid accidents. Therefore, the situation was reported by the police chief, and the First Special District Court was asked to issue a warrant to allow the yarn to be removed from the Xinhua Warehouse and seized for future disposal. After review by the court, the request was approved and the seizure was implemented. The Chinese and Western detectives in charge then arrested the person involved, Zhang Zaixing. Yesterday, he was also sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Meng conducted an interrogation. According to the request of the police department lawyer Qian Xunjiu for an extension to facilitate the investigation, Zhang was ordered to be detained and the interrogation was rescheduled.

### Zhou Fugen - Fighting for the Nations

The guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai have been very active recently. Since Miao Sen was appointed as the direct captain of the action team in the western part of Shanghai, the guerrilla work has become even more intense. He has repeatedly annihilated the Japanese army and achieved remarkable results. It is reported that Captain Zhou Fugen, who was dispatched by Miao to patrol the Xinjing Yejiadun area in northwestern Shanghai, encountered more than 30 Japanese soldiers. He killed more than 10 Japanese soldiers on the spot. Zhou was also shot in the arm and suffered serious injuries. It is now reported that Zhou has died of his injuries. Director Miao of the branch team mourned Zhou's death in the line of duty. In addition to submitting a request to the superiors for preferential treatment, he also held a meeting to mourn. Zhou was 28 years old and a native of Jintan, Jiangsu. He served as a company commander in the 3rd Division of the Army. He bravely fought against the enemy in the "August 13th" battle and made great achievements.

### A Pedestrian Was Killed by a Tram

Zhu Qingxiang, a native of Ningbo, 55 years old, was working as a porter in 118 Lane, Huanlong Road, French Concession, and lived in the lane with his family. On the afternoon of the 4th, he went to the Great World to play. When he left the venue to go home at 1:15, he walked to the intersection of Kaizi Road and Glock Road, Baxianqiao. A French-owned tram No. 96 on Route 2 traveling between Xujiahui and 16th pier was coming from east to west. Zhu was unable to avoid it and was knocked down, injuring his head. The police copied the number and sent Zhu to Guangci Hospital. Due to his serious injuries, he died in the hospital without being rescued. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall Forensic Examination Office and notified the family members to report to the Second Special Court for inspection today.

### Yesterday Was the Lantern Festival in the Lunar Calendar - Women in Skirts and Wooden Clogs Danced at the Rainbow Temple - It Was Impossible to Walk in the City God Temple in the South City

Yesterday was the Lantern Festival in the Lunar Calendar. Women in Shanghai all like to burn incense on this day. In previous years, the City God Temple in Nanshi and the Bao'an Situ Temple (i.e. the Rainbow Temple) on Nanjing Road were crowded with women burning incense. The scene of skirts and wooden clogs dancing and the fragrance of clothes and hairpins was extremely grand. The City God of the City God Temple would also patrol the streets on this day, with all kinds of performances, which was especially grand. However, since the start of the all-out war of resistance, the suburbs of Shanghai have been besieged on all sides, and the City God Temple has fallen into the guerrilla area. Therefore, the act of patrolling has become a thing of the past. However, the Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road had more women burning incense this year than in previous years due to the dense population in the concession. From morning to night, the temple was overcrowded. Ren Changtai Candle Shop on the left of the temple was even more crowded. Therefore, the police specially dispatched many Chinese police officers to suppress the crowds outside the temple and outside the candle shop. This scene of smoke and jewels reflecting each other did not disappear until after 6:00 pm.

### Fu Xiao'an Instigated His Henchmen to Investigate "Terrorists"

(Special Report from This Newspaper) Pseudo "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiao'an, in view of the constant staging of recent assassination incidents, could not sleep peacefully. In addition to deciding to build 40 small fortresses around the pseudo-municipal government for defense, he secretly appointed Wang Yunkui (transliteration), a Tianjin native who survived an assassination attempt on Hed Road a month ago, as a special commissioner for the pseudo-municipal government to investigate "terrorists" in the British and French concessions. After Wang received the pseudo-order, he quickly formed three teams of twelve people each, and has now begun operations.

### A Hearse Overturned at the Intersection of Daxilu and Dunxin Road - Twelve Passengers Were Injured

Fan, the boss of the Quanxingkang Hotel on Zhejiang Road, died of a stroke. Yesterday, his funeral was held at the Dahua Funeral Home at the intersection of Daxilu and Dunxin Road. At that time, a hearse hired from the Taiping Ban Chang Automobile Company also followed the procession. All 12 people were employees of the wine shop. Unexpectedly, the car overturned at Dunxin Road at about 11:00 am, not far from its destination. All the passengers were slightly or seriously injured and were taken to Baolong Hospital by another car. 11 people were bandaged and discharged from the hospital because their injuries were not serious. Only Zheng Heqing, a native of Shaoxing, 36 years old, had a broken right arm and shoulder bone, with internal injuries. He needed an X-ray examination, so he was still in the hospital for treatment. The other 11 people with minor injuries included Lu Ashou, a native of Shaoxing, 33 years old, with injuries to both hands, Ruan Fude, a native of Ningbo, 14 years old, with a head injury, Wan Shengrong, a native of Ningbo, 31 years old, with a hand injury, Zhu Akang, a native of Ningbo, 65 years old, with a head injury, Zhu Fashun, a native of Hangzhou, 41 years old, with a hand injury, Tong Xiangsheng, a native of Ningbo, 22 years old, with a hand injury, Xu Wenwei, a native of Shaoxing, 34 years old, with a head injury, Zhang Dengqing, a native of Shaoxing, 32 years old, with a head injury, Shen Jinsheng, a local, 45 years old, with a face injury, Ruan Xingyuan, a native of Ningbo, 58 years old, with an ear injury, and Huang Kunfu, a native of Ningbo, 37 years old, with a chest injury.

### A Fire Broke Out in the Ewo Packing Factory - More Than a Dozen Bales of Cotton Yarn Were Destroyed

At around 2:30 pm yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at the Ewo Packing Factory at 912 North Suzhou Road. The Central Fire Brigade received the report and immediately drove to put out the fire. It was immediately extinguished. It is estimated that more than a dozen pieces of cotton yarn were destroyed by fire, but a lot of cotton yarn was soaked in water, resulting in huge losses. The cause of the fire is unknown.

### Yesterday's Public Celebration for Wen Lanting's Birthday, With Over a Thousand Well-wishers; Du Yuesheng and Others Sent Telegrams Offering Remote Congratulations

Yesterday marked the 70th birthday of Mr. Wen Lanting, a leader in the yarn industry and philanthropic circles. Coinciding with the Lantern Festival according to the abolished lunar calendar, a public celebration was held by various sectors at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association. The previous evening, Mr. Wen's disciples and others hosted a banquet to offer advance congratulations. Starting from 8:00 AM yesterday, friends from all walks of life continuously arrived at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association to offer their congratulations. Over a thousand people attended, including Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Jiying, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Yan Junren, and Tang Zhiliang. Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Mao Heyuan, and others also sent telegrams from Hong Kong, remotely wishing Mr. Wen longevity and a prosperous life. The Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association's conference hall was set up as a ceremonial hall. As it was the Lantern Festival, the Shanghai Hongshou Calligraphy and Painting Association designed and hung up a "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" lantern display, illuminated by electric lights, which was extremely unique. In addition, there were numerous congratulatory couplets and poems presented by various sectors, a dazzling array. Guests were presented with Mr. Wen's photograph and a commemorative album. The Shanghai Yarn Exchange's national music ensemble performed on-site, and the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts and Music sang congratulatory birthday songs. The ceremony was simple yet solemn. The organizing committee, following Mr. Wen's instructions, kept everything frugal. Guests' birthday gifts were divided into three types: one, two, and three yuan. The banquet was purely vegetarian, and smoking, drinking, and theatrical performances were eliminated, aligning with the principle of thrift.

### Public Slaughterhouse in the French Concession Confiscates Pork, Valuing It at Six Cents Per Pound; Slaughtering Businesses Hold a Meeting and Disclaim Responsibility

The Shanghai French Concession's slaughterhouse for paddy-fed livestock has a long-standing practice that after live pigs are slaughtered, they must be inspected by a doctor and stamped before they can be sold on the market. If the inspection fails, the pigs are not stamped and are returned to the owner for rendering into oil, the proceeds of which are still worth fifty to sixty percent. Last month, the French Concession slaughterhouse suddenly revised its regulations, stipulating that unstamped pigs would all be sent to the Public Concession's oil rendering factory for rendering, valued at six cents per pound. This differs greatly from the proceeds of rendering the oil themselves. Because the owners are in the meat industry, and the slaughtering businesses are only responsible for slaughtering on their behalf, charging a few jiao per head, the Fresh Pork Slaughtering Business Association, in order to avoid liability, convened a discussion meeting for members of the Second Special District at No. 12 Yu Qiaqing Road yesterday afternoon. Over forty people attended, including Sun Hanming, Liu Jinpei, Jin Cailang, Zhang Guorong, and Pang Minggen. Cao Wenquan was delegated to attend on behalf of the meat industry. The following resolutions were passed: 1. This association slaughters pigs on behalf of the meat industry and assumes no responsibility for any confiscations after slaughter. 2. The slaughterhouse's confiscation receipts will be returned to the meat shops. 3. In addition to having already sent a letter to the Meat Industry Association's Second Special District office, this association is willing to follow and assist to the best of its ability if that association initiates negotiations with the French authorities. The meeting then adjourned.

### Husband Lures Wife Out, Then Savagely Chops Her With a Hatchet; Husband Claims His Wife Lied; Court Orders Postponement for Further Examination of Witnesses

Xu Zhao, a woman from Pudong, is 27 years old and currently resides at No. 152 Caishi Street. Over half a year ago, she married Xu Azhong (33 years old this year), a fellow villager, through a failed matchmaker. Xu works as a carpenter. Since their marriage, they have had two children. However, on December 17th of the previous year, at around 7:00 PM, Xu tricked his wife Zhao into going out together, claiming they were looking for a house. When they reached Ping'anfang in Jiaxiyi Road, near Dapu Bridge, Xu suddenly produced a sharp hatchet and savagely chopped at Zhao. Fortunately, she quickly dodged, and only her clothes were slightly damaged. But Xu's malice was not yet satisfied, and he tried to gouge out her left eyeball but failed, causing her face to be covered in blood. After she cried out for help, Xu finally fled the scene. She then reported to the French police, and detectives arrested Xu. He was transferred to the Criminal Eighth Court of the Second Special District Court the day before yesterday. The French Concession's administrative authorities initiated a public prosecution for the crime of harming a spouse. The plaintiff stated the details of the attack. Xu Azhong testified that his wife Zhao had fled to her sister's house last year and had used up all of the savings of the household. That day, his wife forcibly snatched the hatchet from his hand on the road, and the injury to her face was caused by the struggle. He claimed that she lied to the police about him committing the violence and requested an investigation. Judge Qiu reviewed the testimony and ordered a postponement for further examination of witnesses. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Academic Circles Rise to Support the Cloth Clothing Movement; Girls' School Swears to Join; All Sectors Unanimously Support

Since the Shanghai Cloth Clothing Association initiated and advocated the wearing of cloth clothing to promote the cloth clothing movement, and designated this year as the Cloth Clothing Year, all sectors of the city have unanimously supported it. They all believe that this movement not only conforms to the principle of thrift but also benefits the national economy and people's livelihood. Under the current circumstances, it should be vigorously promoted. The establishment of the association is indeed timely and appropriate. Encouraged by this, the association's work has become even more intense in recent days. It is also learned that the association received a letter from a well-known girls' school in western Shanghai, stating that all 1,214 teachers and students of the school, in agreement with the association's proposal, have sworn to wear cloth clothing and are willing to join as members. The association immediately sent a reply welcoming them. It is reported that the number of middle school teachers and students in the city who have joined the association has reached as many as five schools, but the girls' school is undoubtedly the most enthusiastic this time.

### Jinqian Brand Thermos Bottle Company

Industry giants Dong Jifu, Cao Bingquan, Zhang Wenkui, and others initiated the organization of the Jinqian Brand Thermos Bottle Co., Ltd., setting up a large-scale manufacturing factory to manufacture various high-quality thermos bottles. The capital is 150,000 yuan in national currency, which has already been fully subscribed. Yesterday, the founding meeting was held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Ninety-seven shareholders attended. Mr. Bei Zuyi, standing director of the Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants, attended to supervise the proceedings and publicly elected Mr. Rong Fangzhou as chairman. First, the initiator, Mr. Dong, reported on the preparations and establishment matters.

### The Lower Reaches of the Huangpu River Suddenly Became Tense Yesterday; Many Rumors in Hongkou, the Area is Unstable; All Ships, Large and Small, on the Huangpu River Were Thoroughly Searched

The Hongkou area has been rife with rumors in recent days, and the Japanese are on high alert. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the situation suddenly became tense in the Huangpu River, from the Japanese Consulate in the Suzhou Creek eastward to the Songkou area for a distance of thirty to forty li. Several Japanese naval infantrymen, traveling by motorboats or small steamers, searched ships up and down the river. Except for large vessels, all small steamers, barges, wharf boats, sampans, and other civilian vessels operating on that section of the Huangpu River were ordered to stop at any time, and armed searches were conducted. Special attention was paid to hidden compartments. It is reported that this measure by the Japanese side is to prevent weapons from being smuggled into the Hongkou area by waterway, so as to prevent the area that the Japanese consider safe from being threatened. However, after being busy all day, they apparently did not find any weapons or dangerous goods. It is also learned that the three ferry crossings of Pudong Gaoqiao, Donggou, and Gaomiao along the north Huangpu River are defended by the Japanese army. Recently, it has been reported that the guerrillas on the Chuansha border have repeatedly used these three places to send brave team members, carrying weapons, to find small boats to cross to the Jiangwan Wusong area to engage in dangerous work. The Japanese have therefore paid close attention and must strictly search all those entering and leaving the ferry crossings. In addition, disguised as hawkers in plain clothes, they sent "troops" to secretly scout the whereabouts of the guerrillas. It is heard that the Japanese Army and Navy Special Service Department has jointly organized a wharf reconnaissance team to cut off the transportation of Chinese activists and guerrillas.

### Talking About Refugee Production Education

— Zero

Some people say: "The refugees in Shanghai are really enjoying themselves, eating their fill all day and doing nothing!"

This is a "specious" statement. Some of the refugees in Shanghai have already participated in productive work. According to recent statistics, there are sixty-one types of small craft work that refugees in Shanghai are involved in, totaling more than 13,700 people. It can be seen that the refugees in Shanghai are not just sitting around and not working. Even for those who have no work to do, look, they are cramped in the reception centers all day long; they only eat enough to survive, and it is impossible to talk about "enjoying themselves"!

However, there are indeed two points that need to be discussed about the current refugee production work:

1. Lack of Opportunity: Some people lack the skills for the work, so only more than 10,000 out of the 100,000 refugees in the city can produce and live. This is not universal enough.

2. Lack of Systematic and Precise Planning: According to recent statistics, there are sixty-one types of small crafts. The work locations are either outside or inside the centers; the wages are either one yuan per day or only three cents per day. In terms of living management and training, there is a lack of systematic and precise planning.

Those of us who work in relief organizations have long had the above feelings and want to open refugee work training classes in the near future to promote refugee production education in a planned way. The types of training classes are as follows:

Soap Industry Training Class

Chemical Industry Training Class

Wireless Radio Transceiver Training Class

Sock Knitting Training Class

Rattan Weaving Training Class

Carpentry Training Class

Foreign Embroidery Training Class

Printing Training Class

Car Driving and Repairing Class

Barber Training Class

Shoemaker Repairing Training Class

Wireless Radio Installation and Repairing Training Class

Weaving Craft Training Class

Cement Worker Training Class

Waiter Training Class

Maid Training Class

The above are a total of sixteen types, and the required expenses are estimated to be no more than 4,000 yuan. We have 100,000 yuan in funding, and other kinds of work can be gradually planned and implemented so that all refugees have the opportunity to acquire work skills. We hope that people from all walks of life will do their best to help the relief organizations so that the production education plan can be fully realized. In this way, the problem of refugee production education can be solved, and social welfare can be improved.

### The Responsibility of the Shanghai Education Community for Refugees

— Sun Xiaolou

The traditional thinking of our country's scholars is that the only duty is to study behind closed doors, cultivate the mind, and pursue learning. Therefore, those who run education are most afraid of meddling in other people's affairs, burying themselves with students in their desks all day long, reading dead books, and reading books to death. It is as if there is no education outside of books, and no education outside of schools, resulting in the cultivation of many consumers who do not work with their limbs, do not know the five grains, and only have themselves and no society.

Although there have been more than 70 years of history since the reform of education, this kind of morbidity has still not been completely eliminated. Although the calls for popular education and mass education are very loud, 80% of the illiterate still occupy the first place among the countries in the world. This is whose responsibility, this is the responsibility of all of us who run education.

There are currently more than 100,000 refugees in Shanghai. It can be said that 90% of these more than 100,000 refugees have no productive skills, and 70% have not received education. Their family property has been destroyed, their flesh and blood have been scattered, they do not have enough clothes to keep warm, they do not have enough food to fill their stomachs, they do not know a word, and they do not have any skills. They can be said to be the most pitiful group of people in Shanghai society. How can those of us who run education still "teach behind closed doors" as before, leading a leisurely and carefree life, and ignoring these suffering and ignorant refugees?

Some people may say: In the past, I have already fulfilled a considerable responsibility at the request of a certain charitable organization in providing food and clothing for the refugees. Very good, donating money to provide for the refugees cannot be said to be unimportant, but passive support is not as good as active education. Recently, the Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association launched a fundraising campaign for refugee production education, planning to raise 100,000 yuan in funding to educate more than 100,000 refugees, so that they can become literate and learn skills, giving the refugees the opportunity to be educated, and teaching the refugees to have productive skills. In this way, the goal of refugees being able to support themselves can be achieved in three or four months, in order to reduce the burden on society and increase the country's production. This is really a very meaningful thing. Standing in the position of the education community, we should actively promote and work hard to advance this plan, so that the goal of 100,000 yuan in funding can be achieved as soon as possible in order to complete the major plan of refugee production education. If you are parents, you can encourage your children; if you are teachers, you can encourage your students; at the same time, all sectors should publicize and encourage each other, then I think that the achievement of the goal of 200,000 yuan will definitely not be difficult. The author hereby petitions on behalf of more than 100,000 refugees before all sectors.

### An Announcement to All Sectors for Raising Funds for Refugee Production Education

— Du Zuozhou

Since the "August 13th" Incident kicked off the war, refugees from all over the country have gathered in Shanghai, numbering nearly one million in total. Thanks to the enthusiastic relief efforts and generous donations from all sectors of Shanghai, refugee reception centers have been organized to accommodate and settle these millions of refugees as much as possible, so that they can solve the problems of food, clothing, and shelter, and not be displaced. It has been nine months since then. Although most of the refugees have been scattered, returning to their hometowns or finding employment, there are still more than 100,000 people left. These more than 100,000 people, on the one hand, rely on the continued generous donations from all sectors, and on the other hand, they rely on the enthusiastic work of the gentlemen who are in charge of relief work to ensure that the entire supply is not a problem. However, this can only be said to be a palliative measure. In the long run, it will not only be difficult to sustain, but it is also not a fundamental solution to the refugee problem.

Currently, the refugees in various reception centers are full and warm all day long and have nothing to do. If we do not think of other active ways to enable them to receive an education and cultivate a skill during this period of being rescued so that they can seek their own independent production, then they will inevitably become idle people in the future. If so, loving them is enough to harm them. Not only will they themselves be harmed for life, but the country and society will also suffer from their disadvantages. No one knows when the war will end. We only know relief, but we do not hurry to make them independent, then this kind of relief work will never end. Therefore, for the sake of the refugees, for the sake of society and the country, and for the responsibility of all sectors, generously donating funds to implement refugee production education is currently the most urgent work.

For this reason, comrades in the Shanghai education and cultural circles have recently launched a fundraising campaign for refugee production education under the organization of the Education Group Fundraising Committee of the Refugee Relief Association. Now, almost all of the teachers and students of large, medium, and small schools in Shanghai have been mobilized. Only five days have passed, and more than 100,000 yuan has been raised. This achievement is very optimistic. From this fundraising campaign, we can see that the people of our country can understand their responsibilities and obligations, and they all have the spirit to fulfill their responsibilities and obligations. With this spirit, we can predict that our work of saving the country and building the country will be completed as scheduled. However, the original target of this fundraising campaign was 200,000 yuan; now it is still far from the target, and we still hope that comrades in the education and cultural circles will continue to work hard, and people from all sectors will continue to generously donate, so that this fundraising campaign with great significance can be completed in the near fundraising period. If you are parents, you can encourage your children; if you are teachers, you can encourage your students; at the same time, all sectors should promote and encourage each other, then I think that the achievement of the goal of 200,000 yuan must not be difficult. The author hereby petitions on behalf of more than 100,000 refugees before all sectors.

In short, refugees are also a part of the Chinese nation. Their lives, like those of our compatriots who have not suffered, can be extended, and their thoughts and skills can be improved. This means that the revitalization of our nation is more assured, and the goal of national revitalization can be achieved. Every descendant of the Yellow Emperor can have the hope of obtaining a happy life. Therefore, it can be said that helping refugees is also helping ourselves.

Under this understanding that helping refugees is helping ourselves, we, the compatriots of Shanghai, who are known as the richest in the country, should first follow the principle of contributing money if we have money, and generously donate to help the more than 100,000 refugees in this city, so that they can receive education and learn productive skills in addition to getting food and clothing.

### "No Home, No Dad."

— Huang Dingzuo

### Helping Refugees Is Helping Ourselves

— Yiming

The more than 100,000 refugees currently in Shanghai, and the millions of refugees throughout the country, like the Chinese people who are not refugees, are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. In other words, today's refugees are still compatriots of the Chinese nation. Shouldn't we be happy and shouldn't we help our compatriots in difficult situations?

Of course, many compatriots are always concerned about the refugees and are doing their best to help the refugees. However, some compatriots neither care nor provide assistance. Why is this so? Because some compatriots do not fully understand the close relationship between refugees and themselves. Therefore, reflected in their actions, they are not concerned about the work of helping refugees.

First of all, we should understand that our country is currently at the most dangerous juncture. Only if the 450 million descendants of the Yellow Emperor, regardless of men, women, old, young, rich, or poor, can unite as one and help each other can we overcome this great crisis. Based on this premise, we help the refugees so that they can have food and clothing and have the opportunity to receive education and learn skills, which is to increase the strength of our entire nation. Conversely, many refugees die or become degenerate due to lack of assistance, or they remain ignorant and do not engage in production, which is to weaken the nation's vitality and reduce the number of helpers we have when dealing with national crises.

Secondly, considering the private interests of those compatriots who have not become refugees, there is also a close relationship with the refugees.

Because the prosperity of a country's people must rely on the development of the entire national economy, and the development of the national economy mainly depends on the prosperity of productivity and the large number of consumers. Now, the number of refugees in the country reaches tens of millions. If such a large number of refugees die or become depraved due to lack of assistance, then the nation's productivity will inevitably be weakened, and the amount of consumption will inevitably be reduced. Under this state of economic depression, all production sectors and business organizations will only tend to decline. Therefore, for the sake of the increasingly prosperous and comfortable economic lives of those compatriots who have not become refugees, it is also necessary to provide the necessary assistance to their own refugees.

### Save the Refugees

— Feng Yixian

It has been many years since the work of saving refugees has been carried out on the isolated island. Even today, our urgent task is still inseparable from the previous task!

The safety of a social collective is based on the stability of the lives of its members. If the people have a livelihood, it can directly reduce criminal behavior and indirectly lay the foundation for social tranquility. There are many refugees on the isolated island now. If there is no overall rescue plan, can the social order be safe, and can we live in peace?

"At the beginning of humanity, people are inherently good." Therefore, all human beings must have great compassion. When we see the displaced refugees, without clothes and food, suffering, can we still bear to stand by and do nothing, and not exert the innate ability of kindness?

Those who are enthusiastic about saving the country are also enthusiastic about saving refugees. Those who are engaged in saving refugees are indirectly equal to engaging in the work of saving the country. Therefore, those who cannot save refugees are not worthy of talking about saving the country. If the national affairs are like this, we should sharpen our swords and prepare. If the environment is like this, we should save the refugees to do the work of saving the country.

In all fairness, the people on the isolated island are at least much better than the homeless refugees. In a moment of thought, with a hand's move, the refugees can be saved. Saving refugees is like saving a fire. Hurry up and save the refugees!

### Establishing a Permanent Foundation for Refugees

— Sun Yucai

There are nearly one hundred thousand refugees in Shanghai right now. The sustenance and livelihood of these one hundred thousand refugees are entirely provided and maintained by the Refugee Relief Association. This association was initiated and organized by Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a leader in Shanghai's business community, who currently serves as its chairman. Mr. Yu is known for his enthusiasm for charity and is widely respected by the nation. Therefore, since its establishment, the association has achieved remarkable results and benefited the refugees immensely, a contribution of no small merit. Despite being in his twilight years, he is still willing to contribute his wealth and energy, which truly inspires and impresses us. "The heart of compassion is in all men," this is everyone's business, and we should all stand up and work hard!

Simply maintaining the refugees' lives is not an active solution, nor is it a fundamental one. As the saying goes, "Sitting and eating, the mountain will be empty." People cannot just sit and eat; they must work and produce. Production is the obligation people should fulfill, and it is undoubtedly necessary for refugees to do their best and produce together. However, how to produce? How to maximize production efficiency? These issues need to be studied. In the past, many shelters have also engaged in production work, but with little success, and in a fragmented way. Recognizing this, the association established an education committee to solicit donations and publicly elected leaders in the education field, such as Mr. Xi Yushu, Mr. Chen Heqin, and Mr. Chen Jicheng, as chairmen, along with principals of major and minor schools in the city and prominent figures in the cultural world as standing committee members, preparing to leverage the power of the education and cultural sectors to complete a refugee production education fund of one hundred thousand yuan to solve the refugees' production problems and lay a permanent foundation for them.

Soliciting donations for the refugee production education fund is indeed an opportunity for our education community to serve the refugees. We have hundreds of thousands of students in major and minor schools throughout Shanghai, and nearly ten thousand faculty and staff members. A target of one hundred thousand yuan is the bare minimum, and we sincerely hope to exceed it by fifty thousand, reaching one hundred and fifty thousand. The use of the funds will be determined by soliciting opinions from all sectors and establishing a meticulous organizational design committee to ensure that the funds are not wasted and that significant results are achieved. We hope that all schools at all levels and all members of the cultural community in the city will unite and ensure that everyone participates in this general mobilization, as this is a manifestation of our spirit. At the same time, we also hope that people outside the education community will generously donate as they wish and contribute to this righteous cause because this is the most valuable and meaningful fundraising campaign since August 13th.

The anticipated date of the tenth is fast approaching. This is the only benevolent act to establish a permanent foundation for the refugees. Let the masses unite, work hard, and complete it!

### Educating Refugees

— Hua Zhicheng

The significance of education lies in assisting the development of mankind to adapt to the evolution of the world. To guide someone on the right path is called teaching; to allow them to grow naturally is called nurturing. There should be no boundaries of poverty or wealth, and no feelings of difficulty or ease. Only when teaching is difficult is there a greater need to teach; only when nurturing is difficult is there a greater need to nurture. If one only educates those who are easy or near, it is certainly not the fundamental purpose of our education.

"The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every individual": its significance is not limited to the individual alone? It also depends on how those responsible for educating the individual teach and nurture them. If taught properly, the individual can become a pillar of the nation; if taught improperly, even if not an individual of low status, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not become thieves, or even traitors!

Regardless of the past state of Chinese education, what strengths does it reveal to us that can be attributed to past education? What weaknesses are the inevitable responsibility of past education? At this time of the War of Resistance, how should those of us responsible for education act according to our conscience? The only urgent task is to promote refugee production education. However, promoting refugee production education is no easy task. Yet, where our responsibilities and ambitions lie, we must not hesitate. As the saying goes, only when teaching is difficult is there a greater need to teach; only when nurturing is difficult is there a greater need to nurture. It is hoped that the general public will do their best to support the promotion of refugee production education, so that the country can increase its human and material resources, and that refugees will not be tainted by bad habits and endanger the nation. This is not only a matter of our conscience.

Saving one yuan can teach a refugee a skill.

### Following Government Laws

— Mao Lie

Our actions naturally prioritize the War of Resistance. Besides direct military actions, those of us, especially in guerrilla areas, can help the war effort by not cooperating with the enemy, which can be considered passive work. Following the laws of our central government, on the other hand, can be considered active work.

Our central government is leading the compatriots of the entire nation in a difficult struggle to achieve the independence and freedom of the country and the nation. All citizens should support it as much as possible, and naturally, they should carry out its laws in everything. However, based on what our eyes and ears have encountered, it seems that some people have not made any effort in this regard, even treating laws with disdain.

The president of a court refused to step down, causing laughter at home and abroad. Fortunately, he made amends afterward, allowing the matter to pass. The double-appointment of principals of provincial schools has been seen repeatedly, and whether it has been completely resolved is probably still brewing. The government wants us to contribute cash and silver, but hoarding is probably rampant. The government controls foreign exchange, but the amount of private foreign exchange purchases is unknown…

If these things happened in guerrilla areas isolated from the central government, where government laws cannot be reached for the time being, it would be understandable. But now they are happening in "isolated islands" where laws still reach and various agencies still exist. If these people are unwilling to be traitors and unwilling to be slaves to a fallen nation, then it cannot be said that they are not walking down the path of traitors and slaves!

Under such oppression from foreign enemies, it is not easy that we still have a government that we like and trust. If we want it to be as stable as Mount Tai, but are unwilling to follow its laws to give it a solid foundation and strong power, isn't that like traveling south by heading north, sabotaging ourselves!

As for those in guerrilla areas, government laws may not always reach directly, but once they are known, I believe that we can only follow them immediately to alleviate the suffering under the enemy's iron hooves.

We compatriots in guerrilla areas, including those on "isolated islands," find it not difficult not to cooperate with the enemy; it is even less difficult to follow the laws of our central government! Why do we still hesitate and wait, or make trouble for ourselves by not actively engaging in this great event that is so effective for the War of Resistance!

### Guest

— Dongfang

After a drastic change, a large part of the city was burned to the ground. My home was spared, and we lived huddled together. It rained continuously, and the roads outside were full of mud. A man with a beard like spears, muttering to himself, walked back and forth in the rain. Raindrops dripped from his long hair, as if he had climbed out of the river; his appearance was haggard, foolish, and strange. I watched him for a long time from the door, felt sorry for him, and beckoned to him. He blinked his white eyes at me and continued to pace back and forth, ignoring me. My whole family talked about him, but we couldn't figure out what was going on.

As night approached, I looked over there again, but the long shadow was gone. Early the next morning, Dong'er ran in anxiously and said:

"Someone drowned in the pond outside the back door!"

The adults, numbed by the nerves, couldn't muster any emotion for the death of a person; they slowly ran to the pond, where they saw a person lying inside, with two muddy feet still resting on the shore. We tried to lift him up, and it was clearly the strange guest who had been pacing at the door! I suddenly felt a jolt, as if struck by lightning.

I reported it to the district chief, went through the formalities, and no one could identify the deceased. The general conclusion was: not a local.

This small ripple eventually subsided and was gradually forgotten as time passed. A few days later, Lao Zhang, who worked at the district chief's office, came to chat and gave me a stack of documents, saying that they were written by the drowned stranger and found in his pocket. The handwriting was strong, and the sentences were between understandable and incomprehensible. Lao Zhang said, "Read it and then tell me what you think." I looked through them one by one:

You say I am a guest, but are you the hosts?

Although I was not born here, I personally designed this house, I personally arranged this garden, and I personally irrigated these flowers and trees with scoops and buckets of water from the pond. That is my study, and this wall is hung with a couplet I wrote myself. The first line is, "But there is a jade beauty who often catches my eye," and the second line is, "There are no worldly affairs to trouble my heart." These are Wang Cihui's lines, which you wouldn't understand, but I just like these two lines of Wang Cihui. You must think: it is already such a great blessing to have a jade beauty catch your eye, let alone often? I have this blessing. Unfortunately, you thugs forced your way in and drove my jade beauty away; the whole family scattered, and even I was driven away. I couldn't find a place to live on the street, so I ran back, only to be driven out again. Alas. Along the long corridor facing the garden, many horses were tied to the pillars, and you didn't feed them, so they were so hungry that they gnawed on my corridor pillars, gnawing them beyond recognition. Also, my screen, with Qiu Shizhou's paintings on it, was torn down and used for firewood, leaving only a few bare frames thrown in the garden. When I ran back, you wanted to beat me and kill me; you didn't understand what I said, and I didn't understand your nonsense. But you must think: who is the host?

Outside, I was starving. All my acquaintances were dead, and all I met were jackals, widening their eyes to eat me. The weather was also terrible, with heavy rain for days, soaking me to the bone. Alas, if I didn't come back, would you have me die in the street? But you changed your fathers; those fierce and terrifying robbers were gone, and there were no more horses. You all put on pretentious masks, wearing long robes and short jackets, and hung a plaque on my door saying something like "Office of Such-and-Such." I ran in, and you ordered people to stop me at the gatehouse; treating me like a guest, asking me who I wanted to see. Who do I want to see? I am the host! You insisted on treating me like a guest!

I said I was the owner here, and you all laughed and didn't let me in. Looking in from the gatehouse, it seemed there were many well-dressed people, bowing and yielding, talking and laughing in a harmonious manner. It was truly a ghostly scene, truly a ghostly scene!

Is there such a thing in the world? I built the house myself, but I can't live in it myself! You made a mess of everything, but you treated me like a guest, stopping me at the gatehouse! Not allowing me to live here, I can only die. I can't find my relatives; I have nothing to eat; I have no clothes to wear; the thousands of books in my belly cannot be exchanged for food.

Am I to die in the street? I am not reconciled; I must die at home! I want to die in the garden I cultivated myself, I want to sink in my own pond. I will consider it a loss, I can't beat you, and even in death, I will not spare you. You must think: who is the host, and who is the guest?

In the past, there were sons of wealthy families who gambled away the houses left by their ancestors in one game. They drifted away, unable to return home. Alas, I never liked gambling; when did I gamble away this house to you?

I have a belly full of questions, but you refuse to answer them. When I die, you will see that my eyes are wide open...

After I finished reading, I couldn't say anything, and I lowered my head for a long time; Lao Zhang didn't say anything either. I secretly looked at him and saw that he was staring at me with wide eyes.

Like a bird flying out of its cage, I left home without any reluctance.

That quiet and gloomy courtyard had consumed my entire twenty years of life, like a caged bird! No, like a convicted criminal, I could not enjoy the joy of freedom.

I wanted to rush out of that gray wall several times.

But I had not yet grown wings that could fly high! My kind mother's tears kept me trapped in the narrow box.

Year after year, a full twenty years! My height has already exceeded that gray wall; the strength of my hands can also push down this old house.

From this time on, my chest has a more restless heart!

Finally, one night, I secretly climbed over that wall and left the old residence where I had lived for twenty years without any pity. My kind mother's tears could no longer hold back the heart of her grown-up son! I am unwilling to waste my future life in this small cage, I want to create a new world of freedom!

At this moment, I am running on the road: like a bird out of its cage, I will never miss the home surrounded by that gray wall!

### Talking About "Not Reading" Again

— Wu

One day five years ago, I happened to meet my fellow villager Mr. Wang XX. At that time, he had just resigned from a certain position in the county government of his hometown and was preparing to devote himself to social work. He said: "I now plan to spend half a day working and half a day reading. Over the years, all the knowledge I have accumulated has been continuously depleted during my service, and it is almost exhausted and outdated. If I don't read anymore, how can I avoid the misfortune of falling behind? So, no matter what, I should now read a few more books to fill my empty mind." Then he asked me to recommend a few books for him to read.

He was already over fifty years old. In fact, he not only had broad knowledge but also rich experience. His spirit of being eager to learn is truly worthy of admiration and imitation by young people! He often said: Those who serve society are most afraid of the famine of knowledge, because the result of famine often leads to intolerable, dogmatic, and blind self-aggrandizement. The ancients often said: "If you excel in officialdom, then study; if you excel in study, then become an official." We should accurately understand its instructions.

We are familiar with the dynamism of Europeans and Americans and their emphasis on the opinions of others! Because they feel that there is no other way to promote progress than learning. Whether they serve in the government or are in retirement, they are equally enthusiastic about public work and learning. Not to mention anything else, it is common for retired ministers over the age of sixty to attend lectures at universities or ask difficult questions. If Mr. Wang XX is compared with them, then Mr. Wang can still be said to be young and strong! This may be the reason why Mr. Wang often reads books to help him develop his career!

Nowadays, a group of young people are succeeding too quickly and are too easily satisfied. Before long, they are appointed to important positions and take on heavy responsibilities. I think they seem too lucky. Forgive me for speaking frankly, their meager knowledge and insufficient training leave them helpless when facing difficulties. Not only that, but most of them are confident that their knowledge is sufficient to handle everything, thinking that there is no need for them to read anymore? This concept is the fatal wound that limits their future progress!

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

Both sides had meticulously arranged their plans, though Commander Ye was unaware of the details of One-Eyed Li's arrangements. He even doubted whether One-Eyed Li would dare to attend the banquet after receiving the invitation. To his surprise, the next day he received a reply from One-Eyed Li, saying "I will follow your esteemed command." This greatly surprised Commander Ye, who felt that One-Eyed Li was indeed quite daring. Coincidentally, the sentry captured two suspicious individuals that same day. After personally interrogating them, Commander Ye learned that they were spies sent by One-Eyed Li. However, he decided not to reveal his knowledge, and after feigning a scolding, he released them. He then entered and said to Deputy Commander Liang:

"I think this matter is quite tricky. One-Eyed Li is not easy to deal with. Before he even arrives, he has already sent spies to sneak in and gather information. I could easily kill one to warn a hundred, but that would be counterproductive and alarm him, so I released them. Now we must re-arrange our plans carefully to prevent any slip-ups, lest we let a tiger escape back to the mountains and cause future troubles."

Deputy Commander Liang put his hand on his head and pondered for a while, saying:

"Commander, it was good that you released the spies he sent. However, I have one concern. Now that they have done this, they will surely send more people on the appointed day, and may even bring weapons. If we ignore them at that time, we will only add to his strength. But if we try to cut off his wings, I fear he will not come to the banquet. What should we do?"

"Therefore, we must carefully arrange our plans, first to prevent him from escaping this gate, and second to prevent him from escaping Hepu Town."

Speaking to this point, Commander Ye lowered his voice and whispered the plan he had just thought of to Deputy Commander Liang, who nodded in approval.

The appointed date of the banquet arrived. Because Commander Ye had strictly prohibited the leakage of information beforehand, the atmosphere in the town was still the same as usual. Only the inside of the Township Office was particularly tense. Commander Ye had meticulously arranged three ambushes inside the Township Office: the first was behind the screen in the main hall, the second was in the left and right wing rooms of the main hall, and the third was in the left and right side rooms at the gate. Each ambush was equipped with about ten brave personal soldiers. As for the outside arrangements, they were even more strict. Although the troops were told not to interfere with those who were suspicious, they had to closely monitor their actions. (25)

### The Explosion of the Osaka Arsenal

— (Ge'er)

The Japanese army arsenal in the Maida area of Osaka exploded! This is not, as the Tokyo telegram said, something like "Careless handling of gunpowder during transport." This is a firm and unwavering response from the Japanese people with a sense of justice, those whom the Kyoto Metropolitan Police Department recognizes as so-called "traitors to Japan," to their own country's fascist militarists!

In the twenty months of the Japanese fascist militarists' invasion of China, we have seen countless tragedies occur in the Japanese army. The widespread increase in war-weariness is truly growing with each passing day. As reported the other day: "The Northern China Japanese Army Headquarters recently conducted an ideological test on the Japanese troops stationed in Peiping, Tianjin, and sent to Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shandong to fight against the guerrillas, to observe their attitude towards the Sino-Japanese War. The results showed that 38% of the Japanese soldiers expressed war-weariness, most of whom felt that continuing to fight would be fruitless, so they hoped to return to Japan as soon as possible to engage in peaceful life." This is a good example. Other examples include the widespread anti-war sentiment in colonies such as Korea and Taiwan, the "voluntary resignation" of a large number of professors at Tokyo Imperial University due to the arrest of the liberal economist Professor Eijiro Kawai, and the sudden "shaving of his head to become a monk" by a Japanese general who had commanded operations in China. There were also violent riots in Kanto South Bu-machi and Ohtsubo, Japan, on the 17th of last month due to conscription. All of these are simply too numerous to list! And all of these are precisely the explosions of "arsenals" that are accumulating in their hearts! This explosion of the "arsenals" that are accumulating in their hearts has today caused the explosion of the army arsenal in the Maida area of Osaka, and tomorrow it will undoubtedly cause the explosion of all of Japan's arsenals!

However, what is most important and absolutely cannot be ignored is that we must understand: the explosion of the army arsenal in the Maida area of Osaka can be said to be a great, silent bomb launched by our Chinese protracted war of resistance! That is to say: only by continuing our protracted war of resistance in accordance with what our great leader Chairman Chiang has shown us, "not compromising halfway," will the Japanese fascist militarists collapse under our strong resistance and the explosions of all the arsenals in Japan caused by our strong protracted war of resistance!

We must continue our protracted war of resistance and not compromise halfway, and we will see the explosion of even greater military arsenals in Japan!

### The Photographer Saves the Day

— Ruhua

"Sharpshooters"

Produced by 20th Century Fox, screening at the Great Shanghai Theater

"The Photographer Saves the Day" tells the story of how a news photographer bravely saves the young ruler of the Kingdom of Madavenia and captures the rebellious ministers who plotted to usurp the throne. With car chases, airplane rescues, and crowd scenes interspersed, and naturally, an indispensable romance, the film becomes a so-called "thrilling comedy."

However, the director focuses on the "thrilling comedy" part, such as the photographer Steve taking pictures of the prince's flying skills on the plane; Steve's machine-powered bicycle crashing wildly as he rushes to the plane; Steve's escape when he is mistaken for an assassin; the prince strafing with the plane; Diane being imprisoned; the crown prince escaping; and finally the crowd's frenzy, Steve rescuing the prince; these continuous stimuli and thrilling scenes are quite "exciting" to watch; but this is the common disease of all comedies, these scenes are connected by "coincidence." However, the fact that it doesn't have a happy ending is the smartest thing.

But "The Photographer Saves the Day" unintentionally gave us a hint: the conspirators who usurp the throne are not only Count Orloff, but Marquis Matim, whom Steve and Diane trust, is the "real culprit." Therefore, before all conspiracies are exposed, it is impossible to see the faces of those "conspirators," and after the conspiracies are exposed, the remnants must be eliminated to avoid leaving seeds of disaster and the recurrence of conspiracies. At the same time, it also points out that the power of the people is the greatest power.

### Those Who Eat from a Golden Bowl: The Life of a Bank Clerk

— A Bank Employee

(3) Daily Life and Work

The daily work is monotonous. From nine in the morning to four or five in the afternoon, one cannot be without a pen and abacus all day long. "Preparing vouchers," "matching seals," "entering accounts," and "compiling various reports" are the daily routine. It looks easy, but in fact, one must "handle it carefully," especially those working in the business department, who must be "cautious," because the business department is the forefront of the bank, and those working on the front line represent the bank directly in its relationship with customers. Any mistake or conflict can easily give customers a "bad impression," which in turn affects the bank's business and future. Because banks need customers, and more customers, without customers, the bank cannot exist. If the staff in the business department are deficient in any way towards customers, or unable to understand and cooperate, the bank's future will be in jeopardy. This is what managers and directors worry about the most and are most unwilling to see. Therefore, they mediate between the bank managers and the customers, needing to be "thorough in all aspects," neither arrogant nor humble, always striving to satisfy every customer, while also pleasing the manager. Therefore, bank managers and directors pay special attention to the business department staff, especially regarding "modesty of character" and "agility of skills." Furthermore, when they get busy, they often don't even have time for lunch, and it's common for them to eat after one o'clock in the afternoon. The suffering involved is indeed beyond what outsiders can imagine.

Those who work in the accounting department are relatively more relaxed; they are responsible for reviewing the work done by the business department yesterday. And the auditing department is responsible for assessing various reports from the entire bank and compiling the bank's accounts, with its duties above those of the accounting department. In addition, the internal general affairs department includes sections such as correspondence, personnel, and general services. Those who do this kind of work are not necessarily from the financial world, and their work seems relatively leisurely, but their "airs" are a bit grander than those in other departments. They all have considerable "status," especially the head of the personnel department, who manages the personnel of the entire bank, and the rewards, punishments, promotions, and dismissals of all bank employees are in his hands.

Once the daily work is over, it's their time to be active. At this time, those with high incomes ride motorcycles, eat Western food, and frequent dance halls and other entertainment venues; they truly "spend money like water," fully displaying the "airs" of those who "eat from a golden bowl." Those with low incomes, only a few dozen or a few tens of yuan per month, if their family finances are not wealthy, and they still feel compelled to put on the "appearance" of a bank employee, then "living beyond their means" and being "in dire straits" with mounting debts is not uncommon. There is also another type of person, with very low income, who is not particular about food and clothing, and you can't tell from their appearance that they are "eating from a golden bowl." After office hours, they relax in the dormitory or club, or bury themselves in the library. These people are mostly trainees or junior assistants. As each person's "lifestyle" differs, the bank produces all sorts of different people. The romantic and elegant are certainly bank employees, but the pessimistic and dejected, and even those who change careers, are also bank employees. Those with the greatest hope, the widest opportunities, and the easiest success are also bank employees.

All are bank employees: some fail, some succeed, "failure and success are determined by one's own efforts"; bank employees have a special awareness of this - especially "young bank employees," although "connections" still influence the status of bank employees today. (The End)

### A Record of the 50th Troop of Boy Scouts

— A He

The name "Boy Scout" was created in 1908 by British Army Lieutenant General Robert Baden-Powell, and has a history of more than thirty years. Its purpose is to train boys in skills such as transmitting signals, scouting, field trips, and observing things, in order to cultivate the virtues of loyalty, kindness, independence, courage, and perseverance. Its intention is truly worthy of our promotion; therefore, in almost every corner of the world today, there are such military-style group organizations that unite boys.

Speaking of China's Boy Scouts, the history is not short. Most people in society today know about the term "Boy Scout." And in terms of the Boy Scouts themselves, they have indeed done a lot of great and earth-shattering work, and the profound impression they have given us cannot be erased. The reason why Boy Scouts today receive countless praises and approvals in society is, without saying, created by each Boy Scout himself.

The Boy Scouts in this city, in the past or in the present, have been quite honorable, and everything has given people good satisfaction. For minor matters, whenever there are gatherings or ceremonies that need them to come out to maintain order, they are always so enthusiastic and sincere; for major matters, such as after the outbreak of the January 28th and August 13th incidents, they also bravely participated in various rescue and transportation works. In the battles outside Nanjing, the breakthrough in Xuzhou, the destruction in Wuhan, the fall of Guangzhou, and the fire in Changsha, the Boy Scouts of this city have left many great achievements.

Among the Boy Scout troops in this city, the 50th Troop is the most meritorious and worthy of our admiration. During the January 28th incident, four Boy Scouts from the troop, including Mao Zhengxiang, risked their lives in and out of the hail of bullets and died in service; later, a memorial stone tablet was erected on the open space of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, with the names and brief biographies of the four martyrs engraved on it, as a memorial to them. After the August 13th incident began, their work became even more tense, touching, and valuable than before. Below, let me report to you, the readers, what I know about the situation of this troop. (Those already seen in yesterday's local news section of this newspaper are omitted.)

When the war was raging in the surrounding areas near Shanghai, they served in various military hospitals until the national army retreated westward, and then it stopped. But they still organized the so-called "Pathfinder First Aid Team" to risk going to the front lines to rescue the wounded soldiers and refugees.

Later, they also followed the army from Shanghai through Suzhou, Nanjing, Changsha to Hankou to transport various medical supplies. At the same time, they transported wounded soldiers from Shanghai to eastern Zhejiang. After the great fire in Changsha, their headquarters moved to Qiyang to prepare an outline for serving in the rear. At present, their staff are distributed in thirteen provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Yunnan. According to their latest service report, from August 13, 1937, to the end of 1938, they traveled a total of 630,000 kilometers and escorted more than 70,000 soldiers and civilians.

The 50th Troop of Boy Scouts was organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and those who participated in the service were all professional young people around the age of twenty; for the sake of the motherland's fate, they were all willing to abandon their sweet families and go to the inland to fight and do difficult work. Recently, a person named Cang Chengquan (formerly employed by the Longmen Bookstore and Chunsheng Sporting Goods Company in this city) died of malaria in the Central Hospital in Guiyang while escorting medicines through Guiyang—this great spirit of sacrificing one's life for the country is truly worthy of our admiration and emulation!

Young friends on the isolated island! After reading about the deeds of the 50th Troop of Boy Scouts, what are your thoughts? Do you feel ashamed? Please rise up quickly and replace peaceful singing and dancing with hard and continuous work!

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 5: Spring Arrives in Biluo Fragrance Floating over a Snowy Sea, Flowers Fly on Tiger Hill, the Moon Fills Li Lake

He Shuangyu said, "Then does Stone Lake also have tides?" Junsu said, "This place is farther from the sea, so you don't feel the tides. But according to old legends, on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month, the night when the tide is at its highest, you can go to Stone Lake. The Suzhou people's viewing of the 'string of moons' is because the water in the lake is rippling in the bridge holes due to the influence of the night tide, but I think this statement still needs to be studied. However, Stone Lake borders Tai Lake and is surrounded by villages, so it can't be as quiet as West Lake, nor can it be exclusively a tourist area like West Lake. Look! We haven't been sitting here for half an hour, and there have been more than a dozen small motorboats and steamers passing by, all heading to other towns, which shows that this place is a thoroughfare." He Liyu said, "There aren't many tourists here. Look, many yachts are also idle. Yesterday we were in Shanghai, and Sister Jin Danyun accompanied us to the Martyrs' Cemetery in Dachang, and there were many tourists there. After all, Shanghai is a commercial port, and Suzhou is inland, right?" Wu Junsu took a sip of tea and nodded, saying, "Shanghai's population is indeed too dense. Statistics now show that there are seven million people, double the number before the war. But there were many tourists at the Martyrs' Cemetery yesterday because yesterday was Sunday. Wasn't I in Shanghai yesterday too? It's true that Shanghai is so prosperous that it should be decentralized. In the past, Shanghai's population was smaller than Tokyo, Japan. Recently, Shanghai's population rate has not only exceeded Tokyo's population rate, but also exceeded Berlin's population rate in Germany. Naturally, Suzhou is far less prosperous than Shanghai, but because today is Monday. Suzhou is not like it used to be, with too many leisurely friends. Everyone has something to do. Workers work, farmers farm, students study, and there is no more idleness like before. It's not a day of rest, so you're not allowed to play. Even young people can't be like the young masters and young ladies before the war, that's impossible." He Shuangyu said, "How were they like young masters and young ladies? Sister Airen is also from Suzhou, and she has never mentioned it." Wu Junsu said, "Sister Airen lives in the countryside, and she has worked hard since she was a child, so she wouldn't know. I live in the city, so let me tell you two sisters, my family is a large clan, and we have been officials for generations. We have fields, land, real estate, and businesses. Although we can't be considered extremely wealthy, we can be counted among the top families. I was young at that time, so I didn't enjoy the life of a young master or young lady, but I have seen how comfortable and leisurely they were." (53)

### Prospects for the Old Operas (6)

— Yu Tang

Why do I use this analogy? Because I always feel that the old opera is like Liu Adou. Although he can't be supported, he is still a king on the throne. Others who claim to reform the old opera cannot become the orthodox. To all those who fantasize about reforming the old opera, I still advise them to give up this ambition and create a new category. For example, "bengbeng opera" and "Southern opera" are smarter. There is no need to borrow the name of the old opera, which makes it neither fish nor fowl. Didn't I say that the old opera is like a newly unearthed bronze tripod or Shang sacrificial vessel, but the new era does not need it? It can be used for caressing and admiring. If you use an axe to try to turn it into a daily utensil and use it, then you become a fool.

Two years ago, I had an opportunity to have a ten-day talk with Professor Zhang Pengchun on the issue of drama. When it came to the future of the old opera, he completely agreed with my views. Now, I will take the opinions he supplemented as the conclusion of this article:

The old opera is a groundbreaking and glorious achievement in Chinese art. It has its own indelible value in history. However, the wheels of time are progressing too fast, and the old opera has lost all its audience because it cannot keep up, so it is becoming increasingly weak and its future is bleak. Although some people want to use "reform" to save it, it is getting worse and worse. I am afraid that the little essence inherent in the old opera is in danger of being lost. Since the War of Resistance, spoken drama and film have been working hard for the country, but the old opera has been hiding in the rear, only providing entertainment for the idle class, without making any contribution. After the victory of the War of Resistance, when it comes to rewarding merits, the old opera will not only have no share, but will also be forgotten and despised by the general new youth. But even so, the old opera will not easily disappear, because of its artistic status. I hope that soon the overall situation will be settled, and when it comes to reconstruction and construction, the central government can imitate the method of the National Art Museum and set up a National Opera Museum, recruit and concentrate all the old opera talents, and make collections, preservation, organization, and research. A school should also be attached to cultivate talents, and any discoveries should be published in books; occasionally, public performances should be held for the observation and study of true old opera lovers. At the same time, the gramophone and film should be used as much as possible to record the acting skills of those surviving veteran actors and artists and store them in the museum so that a generation of national treasures will not be lost without a trace. In this way, it is better to close the old opera in an ivory tower, so as to avoid it being exposed outside, being eroded by wind and rain, and being eliminated in shame; I think this is better than "reform" and "progress." Some people will definitely scold me for being pedantic, but where is the pedantry? "Ancient" things are originally not bad to "play" with. (The End)

### Film Industry Trends

— Dai Er

Dreaming of U.S. Dollars and Weekly Salaries

Xinhua Company is currently the largest organization in the Chinese film industry. Its recent takeover by the American China United Film Company came suddenly and has attracted much attention from society. It is said that the American company has strong capital and is preparing to expand the scale of film production. On March 1, hundreds of people from the company gathered and unanimously resolved to join the new American company. The next day, they published a notice in various newspapers. This cannot be said to be the biggest event in the film industry in recent years.

After the meeting that day, the male and female actors of Xinhua were strolling and chatting in the Lilac Garden film studio. The more they talked, the more excited they became. Person A said, "From today onwards, the salary we receive may become American dollars." Person B said, "Not only will we be paid in U.S. dollars, but we may also change from monthly salaries to weekly salaries according to Hollywood's practice." Person C said, "When the American bosses see that we have worked hard, they may give each of us a house and a car." It's really wishful thinking and daydreaming. If dreams can come true, these employees will be wealthy enough. For example, those who used to have a monthly salary of one hundred yuan will now have one hundred U.S. dollars a week. According to the current exchange rate, one U.S. dollar can be exchanged for more than six legal tender yuan. Even calculated at six yuan, they can get 2,400 legal tender yuan per month. What a considerable amount.

Raising Film Prices Calculated in Hong Kong Dollars

Since the outbreak of the war, the sales market for domestic films has shrunk a lot. The inland provinces cannot be reached, and the largest market is still the Nanyang Islands. In recent years, foreign exchange rates have soared, and one foreign currency yuan in Singapore and Luzon can be exchanged for more than three legal tender yuan, but the purchase price of films is still calculated at the old price. This is naturally the film merchants taking advantage and the film producers suffering losses. In order to make up for this deficiency, recently, film producers such as Xinhua, Yihua, and Guohua have decided to unanimously switch to selling in Hong Kong dollars, and will not depreciate prices to seek cash. For example, a copy that used to sell for 2,000 legal tender yuan will now sell for 2,000 Hong Kong dollars. With the same 2,000 yuan, the exchange rate adds an additional 1,600 or 1,700 yuan. Since the implementation, film merchants have unconditionally agreed. The film industry has benefited a lot from this subsidy.

However, the staff complained and said, "It's good to calculate the price of the films in Hong Kong dollars, but why don't you pay us in Hong Kong dollars too?"

But the film producers also have their own difficulties, and the staff should just focus on working and not think too much about cheap calculations.

Domestic Blockbusters Have Long Runs

The Lunar New Year has been over for half a month, but the three domestic costume blockbusters that premiered on New Year's Eve are still going on calmly, and there seems to be no movement to replace them with new films for the time being. The enthusiasm of Chinese people for welcoming domestic films and loving domestic goods can be seen. On the other hand, several theaters that show first-run Western films have already changed to new films several times. Each new film is only shown for three or four days, and the audience is not enthusiastic. It is a world of difference from the grand occasion of Shanghai Guang's "Mulan Joins the Army," which has four or five shows a day, with every show fully booked, and tickets must be bought a day in advance. No wonder foreign film merchants feel uneasy.

Some people say: Western films can only sprint, while domestic films are long-distance running experts.

Americans Inquire about Purchasing "Mulan"

"Mulan Joins the Army" is expected to run for more than two months. As of now, it has been less than half a month, and the profit has reached more than 160,000 yuan. At the same time, it is also premiering in Hong Kong. The film price is naturally calculated in Hong Kong dollars. Recently, American film merchants have wanted to buy the U.S. screening rights of Mulan, but the Huacheng authorities are unwilling to quote a price at this time and must wait until Shanghai Guang is finished before they can estimate the price. There is no doubt that the future profits of this film will exceed "Diao Chan."

### Xiantan Society Finds a New Venue - Performing Matinee Shows at the Xianle Grand Theater - Contract Signed and Starting Today

— Yu Sheng

The only surviving Kun opera troupe—Xianni Society—originally affiliated with the Oriental Theater inside the Oriental Hotel, performing one show daily from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm. The contract expired at the end of last lunar year. The Oriental originally wanted Xianni Society to renew the contract, but Xianni Society requested the deletion of the clause "all actors can only be increased, not decreased." The Oriental owner refused, and the two sides argued without resolution, so it was not continued in the Xinmao New Year.

Since leaving the Oriental Theater, Xianni Society has begun looking for a new venue. It once contacted the Dahua Ballroom on Marlborough Road, intending to perform matinee shows in the ballroom, but the permit could not be obtained, and most members believed that the location of the Dahua Ballroom was not suitable for performing Kun opera, so it was abandoned.

Now, as a result of Zhang Chuanfang's efforts, Xianni Society has successfully negotiated with the Xianle Grand Theater, run by Wang Junda and Wang Meiyu. Xianle's spoken drama performs matinee shows until 5:30 pm, and the evening show starts at 8:00 pm. The two hours from 5:45 pm to 7:45 pm in between are decided to be given to Xianni Society to perform one show. The ticket sales will be split equally between Xianni Society and Xianle, and the advertising fees and electricity fees will be borne by Xianle. The contract was signed on the evening of the 3rd, with Zhu Chuanming and Zhang Chuanfang as the authorized representatives of Xianni Society. Starting today, the Lantern Festival, they will begin performing on stage. The programs for the three days are arranged as follows:

(5th) Adding Officials, Looking in the Mirror, Qin Tiao Zui Fei, Wu Song

(6th) Night Flight, Dog Hole, Peony Pavilion (Touring the Garden, Piling Flowers, Eulogizing Flowers, Startling Dream)

(7th) Full Version of Qianyuan Mountain, Full Version of Selling Horses

Proposed by Yan Wangshu, a 14-year-old

Red Moves First to Win

Summary of the Red Winning Strategy for Game 15:

Elephant 5 advances 7, Chariot 8 advances 2, Elephant 3 advances 5, Chariot 8 moves to 9, Elephant 5 retreats 7

Chariot 9 moves to 8, General 5 advances 1, Chariot 8 moves to 9, General 5 moves to 4, Chariot 9 retreats 2

Chariot 5 retreats 1, Chariot 9 moves to 8, Chariot 4 retreats 1, Chariot 8 moves to 9, General 4 moves to 5

Chariot 9 advances 3, Chariot 4 moves to 8, Chariot 9 moves to 4, Chariot 8 advances 2, Chariot 4 retreats 2

Elephant 7 advances 9, Horse 6 advances 8, Chariot 5 moves to 3, Horse 8 retreats 6, Chariot 3 advances 3

East 4 moves to 1, Chariot 3 moves to 4, Chariot 1 moves to 4, General 5 advances 1, Chariot 4 moves to 1

Chariot 8 retreats 2, Chariot 1 moves to 4, Chariot 8 moves to 4

According to Mr. Ji Xin, there are still many variations on Xin Yi's move, but it is no more than Red wins, which is the key to the game. After the twenty-seventh move, Chariot 3 moves to 4, Chariot 1 moves to 4, General 5 advances 1, is the most urgent move to force Chariot 4 to move to 1, and then 8 retreats 2, so that the Chariot cannot move, and if it moves, it will be killed in the heart, and then 8 moves to 4 to win.

### Recording the Small Rehearsal of the Shanghai Bank Peking Opera Society

— Piao Wai

The Shanghai Bank has long established a Peking Opera Society to promote the proper entertainment of its colleagues, and its history is very long. It was once suspended after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. It was revived in the winter of last year. On the first day of this month, they held their first small-scale rehearsal. The writer ran to the Shanghai Bank Peking Opera Society on Renji Road at 7 pm that evening. It was an ordinary office that had been transformed, half of it used as a stage and half arranged with seats. On the walls hung the rules for learning opera and the program for today's performance, etc. Although the stage was very small, there were also two spotlights in front of the stage, and there were railings and electric lights on the side of the stage. It can be said to be specific and subtle, with complete equipment.

Most of those who watched the play that day were colleagues from their own bank and family members of the actors. Looking at everyone's faces, they were all smiling with joy. There was also a guest who was holding a camera box and constantly squinting his eyes to take stage photos. There were a total of four plays rehearsed that day: "Golden Platform—"Joining the Army and Bidding Farewell to the Kiln," "Zhang Yi Obtains Reality," and the finale was "Yutang Spring," from the start of the escort to the final trial. Because the writer arrived very late, "Golden Platform" was about to end at this time. Only seeing Yi Li's majestic appearance and Tian Dan's elegant acting, it was a pity not to see Jin Bao. When Xue Pinggui appeared on stage in "Joining the Army and Bidding Farewell to the Kiln," there was a lot of acting, and the expression of parting with Wang Baochuan was also good. Mr. Chen Shide put a lot of effort into his performance, without being sloppy at all; paired with Ms. Tao Qiongzhi's Baochuan, her singing and acting were even and quiet, which was quite fitting. It is said that this was their first time on stage, so this result is truly not easy. In the third play, "Zhang Yi Obtains Reality," Mr. Shi Bingyong played Kang Shi, with his singing skills being experienced and his tone loud, which won a lot of applause from the audience; and the clown Zhang Yi, with his smiling face and comical appearance, made the whole play more lively and interesting. The last play was "Yutang Spring." Mr. Shen Weining's former Su San and Mr. Pu Siluo's Chong Gongdao were both very serious in their singing and acting, following the rules and regulations, and their demeanor was very stable from beginning to end, truly a model for beginners. The latter Su San was played by Mr. Yang Shuomin, who had a beautiful appearance, but his figure was a little timid; his acting was also good. When he appeared on stage, he was quite imposing, but it was a pity that the stage was too small, and there were too many people in the three-hall trial, so although there were stage steps, there was no room for performance. The singing throughout the whole scene was steady and experienced, and there was still a lingering sound after each song, with quite a bit of Mei School style, and the clear pronunciation was especially commendable. The other roles were also very competent in their singing and acting, worthy of being the finale.

Usually, in theater rehearsals, amateur actors only play the main roles and supporting roles, and the rest are filled by the company's actors. However, this time, in the Shanghai Bank's rehearsal, it was not the case. From the main roles to the extras, they were all played by the amateur actors themselves; even the cymbal playing, the violin playing, and the hatred were all made up by the bank employees. This has never been seen in past rehearsals. This spirit of common entertainment, singing and acting by oneself, is really commendable.

It is said that they have a practice rehearsal once a month, and when they are proficient, they are also prepared to perform publicly, sell tickets to help the disaster, so this is really killing two birds with one stone: it is both an extracurricular interest for the employees, and it is also pleading for the victims and providing relief. Although it is entertainment, it has not lost the ancient people's original intention of "treating people as brothers and cherishing all things."

### The Sino-French Drama School Holds Regular Public Performances

The Sino-French Drama School is scheduled to hold its first practical public performance from March 11th to 13th.

### "Doll Dance" Viewing Notes

— Le Tian

A Three-Year-Old Girl Actually Performs on Stage, Singing and Dancing with Utmost Charm

Among the various performing arts in Shanghai, they have developed in a distorted manner, but musical theatre remains deeply silent, with no one paying attention. Perhaps it is because the impression given by the former girl singing and dancing troupes was unfavorable to the general public, so everyone has become indifferent. Recently, I inadvertently heard a friend mention a pair of little sister flowers, who were very young but could sing and dance well. Driven by curiosity, I specially stepped into the Senlo Dance Palace the night before last. At about ten o'clock, under a pink electric torch, the two little dance stars appeared on the stage, and all the guests stood up, truly looking at them with new eyes. Their first program was "Doll Dance," their voices were round and smooth, and their dance moves were light and lively, as if they were very skilled. The most interesting thing was the younger one, who walked with a swaying gait. To describe her smallness, she was like a baby in her mother's arms, but the songs she sang and the dances she danced were strangely sophisticated. In the ten minutes of the performance, no flaws could be seen. Although this is said to be talent, one cannot ignore the hard work of the coach. Then she stood on a chair and sang a song directly into the microphone, which was also very moving, winning a full house of applause.

Later, thanks to Mr. Xie Baosheng's introduction, I talked with their teacher, Mr. Yang Mingxin, for five minutes before I learned that the older sister's name was Lu Jiafeng, with the stage name Yang Nannan (Foreign Girl), and the younger sister was Lu Jiahuan, with the stage name Yang Wawa (Foreign Doll). "Feng" and "Huang" (Phoenix) of the Lu family, named "Nannan" and "Wawa," can be considered wonderfully appropriate. Speaking of child stars, Shanghai has Chen Juanjuan and Wu Rongrong, and Hollywood has Shirley Temple and Kim Hye-soo, but they debuted at the age of ten or older, while these two sisters are five years old and thirty-two months old, respectively, and can actually perform singing and dancing on stage. Don't you think it's amazing?

Mr. Yang said that he started coaching them a month before the outbreak of the "August 13th" incident. He imagined teaching her to sing while she was breastfeeding. This kind of enlightenment work is really not easy. If you don't have patience and a deep understanding of children's psychology, you wouldn't dare to try it. In the past twenty months, they have learned more than a dozen singing and dancing programs and can perform on stage. Generally, children have bad habits, such as liking to eat sweets, eating snacks, not listening to instructions, and not knowing etiquette. The Lu family's Yang Nannan, whom he taught, has already eliminated these bad habits, so she can maintain the conditions for healthy beauty.

Mr. Yang has been engaged in coaching children's singing and dancing as a profession. He has served as a coach for many singing and dancing troupes and amusement park singing and dancing classes. Chen Juanjuan was the first one he successfully trained. Now he plans to prepare a singing and dancing troupe, recruiting children between the ages of three and ten as members, and appear in society with a brand-new posture. In his early years, he worked as a kindergarten teacher for seven years, so he has the interest and experience in coaching young children. I also hope that he will show his housekeeping skills and open up a bright path for general talented children or suffering children.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (121)

— Xu Muyun

The Secret Story of the Temple of Yue Fei Being Occupied by Taoist Priests

People who have lived in the old capital for a long time have no vitality and are extremely lifeless. Everyone embraces the principle of sweeping the snow in front of their own door, fearing that leaves will hit their heads when walking under trees. When it comes to patriotic thought and group organization, that is simply not what they want to hear. Although the number of people in the Pear Garden industry accounts for a large number in Ping City, ranking first among all cities in the country, their solidarity is even more weak and pitiful. Therefore, tens of thousands of temple properties and the Yue Fei Temple, which has a history of more than a hundred years, were actually seized without any effort. Because of my love for archaeology, I took the opportunity of traveling to Ping and asked a friend to introduce me, so I was able to freely view the relics of the temple and learned the beginning and end of the construction and occupation from an old actor, so I specially narrated it. This also shows that people in the acting world themselves are letting go of their rights and do not know how to preserve the various undertakings in the temple created by their predecessors with great difficulty, which is really a very regrettable thing.

The great boss Cheng Changgeng, because his personality, morality, and skills were all above his peers, he took the position of the head of the Sanqing Troupe and concurrently managed the affairs of the Sixi, Chuntai, and Hechun, the four major Anhui troupes. At that time, all the talented people in the acting world in the old capital who had a slight reputation belonged to the four major Anhui troupes. Since Changgeng had already taken the lead of the four troupes, the position of the head of the Yue Fei Temple undoubtedly belonged to him. The acting world of that temple had very rich income, and there was a forest of famous actors. In addition to the imperial court, the mansions of princes and nobles often sent errands, and the extra income was also considerable. Therefore, funds were raised to build the Yue Fei Temple on an open space south of Xizhushikou outside Qianmen. The temple gate faces west to east, and there is a large stage inside the gate, which also faces east. The west, north, and south sides are all multi-story buildings. When performing, female guests all sit upstairs. Small doors are opened on both sides of the second gate, leading to the north and south side courtyards. The south courtyard is about four times larger than the north courtyard. Inside the second gate, there are two north and south side rooms each, three main halls, and three rooms each in the two corridors. They have now been rebuilt into multi-story buildings, magnificent and majestic, filled with antiques, calligraphy, and paintings, as a place for the Taoist priests who look after the temple to cultivate tranquility. Behind the main hall is a vast garden with many trees, flowers, and plants. In addition to this temple, several acres of public burial land were also purchased, attached to the temple, with several city houses and several hectares of good land attached to the outer city. Every year, in addition to the membership fees paid by Huichang, the income from rent and food alone was enough for all the expenses of the temple and more.
