Since Japan began its barbarous and violent attacks on your peaceful country, I have been paying close attention to the development of the situation. I sincerely hope that Your Excellency Chairman will not lose faith in God, because China is on the side of justice and should firmly believe that God will bless and protect it. The people of your country should unite as one, without betraying their country and leader, never be deceived by Japan's false words, and never be bought by Japan. They must also believe that a democratic government is better than Japan's semi-feudal system. Your Excellency Chairman will one day be able to influence all the Chinese people to believe in Christianity. At this time, your country can begin a counteroffensive on both the north and south sides to drive out the Japanese. I cannot be at peace until the Japanese are defeated. I respectfully request Your Excellency to lead the whole country to resist these aggressive bandits, because if they are not eliminated at this time, their power will become stronger in a few years. Japan is an unjust and evil neighbor of your country. I sincerely hope that your country can develop large-scale trade with Britain, the United States, France, and the Scandinavian countries. Every time I read about the atrocities of the Japanese army, my heart is filled with anger. May God and your country's army be able to stop Japan's inhuman aggressive behavior. Your country must not believe the promises of the Japanese warlords. I respectfully wish the Chairman and the Chinese people victory. (3rd Telegram)

Editorial

### Promoting the Non-Cooperation Movement in Guerrilla Areas

Less than two months ago, this newspaper's editorial column discussed the issue of mass movements in guerrilla areas, pointing out that in the new stage of the War of Resistance, mass movements in various guerrilla areas should be as important as military actions. The preliminary work of mass movements should be the implementation of the minimum non-cooperation movement, with concrete guidelines such as "Do not pay grain to the puppet organization," "Do not eat in puppet organization canteens," "Do not inform," "Do not go to puppet government offices to file lawsuits," "Do not send children to puppet schools to study," "Do not buy enemy goods," "Do not take trains, ships, or cars in guerrilla areas unless necessary," etc. Since this issue was raised, Shanghai newspapers have discussed the non-cooperation movement in guerrilla areas several times. Recently, the Fifth National Political Conference passed a proposal for the National Anti-Enemy Covenant, a part of which is also about the non-cooperation movement. The Central Government will set a date for the National Anti-Enemy Covenant, and all citizens of the country must swear to abide by it on that day. Of course, to the extent possible, the people in the guerrilla areas should also participate in the same way. Therefore, the issue of the non-cooperation movement in guerrilla areas today needs to be emphasized in particular, to attract widespread attention, and to promote the necessity of practical and concrete movements.

Although the second phase of the War of Resistance is objectively beneficial to China, it must go through arduous and unyielding struggles in order to achieve the final victory; and the so-called struggle time must be quite long. In such a long process, winning over the people in the guerrilla areas is bound to be a very important matter. In fact, in the last month or two, except for the Hainan Island incident, which was clearly aimed at threatening Britain and France for other purposes, the Japanese troops on the front line have rarely attacked, and have only recently launched a slight offensive. The Japanese army is currently trying to step up its efforts to consolidate its occupied areas, and is using the so-called carrot and stick magic to advance in all aspects of economy, politics, and culture, simultaneously and rapidly, to lure and deceive the Chinese people, while at the same time doing its best to squeeze the Chinese people. Under these circumstances, the Chinese side's countermeasures can only be to strengthen the organization of the masses in the guerrilla areas, reduce the opportunities for its own ethnic elements to be used by the enemy, and at the same time weaken the enemy's strength. What should mass organization take as its core? Only the non-cooperation movement is the most concrete and the easiest to implement effectively.

The non-cooperation movement originated in India, with the Indian people refusing all relations with Britain in terms of titles, peerages, employment, education, and trade, as a means of non-violent passive resistance. People who talk about revolution often believe that this kind of passive movement is of no avail, so it is not worth promoting. However, the non-cooperation movement in China's guerrilla areas is coordinated with guerrilla military actions, and is not a purely passive movement. Even if it is believed that the non-cooperation movement is passive in nature, the British rule in India has been going on for many years and its foundation is solid, so Gandhism is indeed not easy to be effective; but in China's guerrilla areas, the Japanese army's control is still very fragile, and every bit of nourishment is useful to them. The non-cooperation movement is exactly like drawing firewood from under the pot, which can cut off all the nourishment that the Japanese army intends to extract in the occupied areas. The effect will definitely be very significant, and it will give the other side a very severe blow.

The non-cooperation movement in guerrilla areas has now reached the stage of actual promotion. Those responsible for the work in various guerrilla areas should, in the shortest possible time, formulate several concrete items based on the actual local conditions, and launch them simultaneously with the swearing of the National Anti-Enemy Covenant. When carrying out the movement, the following points should be paid special attention to:

First, the essence of the non-cooperation movement is passive, but after being coordinated with guerrilla military actions, it has been transformed into an active movement; therefore, the non-cooperation movement that is currently being promoted must be coordinated with guerrilla military actions, and the method of isolated movement must not be adopted.

Second, although the non-cooperation movement can be the core of mass organizations, only in the organizational structure of mass organizations can the non-cooperation movement be concretely developed; therefore, the non-cooperation movement in guerrilla areas is not simply proposing some guidelines and leaving it at that, but must develop mass organizations universally.

Third, under the premise of the non-cooperation movement, the public should be encouraged not to return to the cities. In fact, many people in the guerrilla areas are forced to return to the cities, which not only provides material for the Japanese army to boast about, but also has the suspicion of aiding the enemy in fact. The fundamental spirit of the non-cooperation movement should be to besiege the cities, isolating the Japanese army and the traitors; at the same time, the various villages can be self-sufficient and not depend on the city for assistance. This point is also worthy of deep attention.

### British Loans to China Increase Tenfold, Expanded Loan Negotiations Make Great Progress, First Batch of Purchase Contracts Can Be Signed Soon

(London) During the afternoon meeting of the House of Commons today, independent member Butterley (that is, the diplomatic correspondent for the Liberal Party News Chronicle) asked whether the government intends to provide financial assistance to China.

After this bill is passed, this money can be used to guarantee China's accounts for purchasing British military supplies. As for non-military supplies, it can of course be guaranteed. However, it may be difficult to supply China with British aircraft and anti-aircraft guns because they want to expand their own military equipment. According to current news, the China Government Procurement Committee is currently negotiating with the British Export Guarantee Department, and it seems to be purchasing machines and tools for manufacturing military supplies.

### New Pope Addresses the World, Defending Peace and Justice; Inauguration Ceremony This Month on the 12th; Chairman Lin Sent a Congratulatory Telegram Yesterday

(Chongqing) Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope. Chairman Lin sent a congratulatory telegram today, which read: "To His Holiness Pope Pacelli, I am delighted to hear of your election. On behalf of the National Government and the people of the whole country, I sincerely offer my congratulations. I trust you will accept them. Lin Sen." (Dispatch of March 3rd)

Vatican City: The new Pope Pius XII this morning delivered his first radio address to Catholics around the world, urging all nations to respect peace and justice, and to practice charity and harmony. His words were earnest and moving, and his voice was calm and firm. He said that he prayed to God to lead all nations towards prosperity and civilized progress, and then he offered blessings and prayers. His words were broadcast worldwide from the Sistine Chapel. The new Pope is scheduled to hold his coronation ceremony on March 12th, and then go to the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano outside the Vatican to take possession of the church. This will be the first time a Pope has left the country since 1870. The new Pope's first official act was to accept the solemn obedience ceremony of the Archbishop's Seminary of the Sistine Chapel. (Reuters, March 3rd)

Vatican City: After Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State of the Vatican, was elected as the new Pope, Cardinal Domenico, the Chief Deacon, publicly announced on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, "Cardinal Pacelli has been elected as the new Pope, with the holy name of Pius XII." Upon hearing the news, the crowd cheered and paid their respects for a long time, and sang hymns. At the same time, all the churches rang their bells to celebrate. Today happens to be Cardinal Pacelli's 63rd birthday. After being elected, he put on the papal robes and came to the balcony to bless the crowd. The Italian troops guarding the area around St. Peter's Basilica also saluted with their rifles. (Havas, March 2nd)

Vatican City: The College of Cardinals formally elected Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State of the Vatican, as the new Pope at 4:00 PM today. After the results of the voting were announced, Cardinal Granito, the oldest Cardinal, slowly stepped forward and asked Pacelli, "Do you wish to be Pope?" Pacelli replied, "I do." Then, the Cardinals escorted the new Pope to a room next to the altar in St. Peter's Basilica. After he put on the papal robes, he returned to the altar, and each Cardinal knelt down and kissed his hands and feet. The new Pope then helped them up and embraced them as a courtesy. After the ceremony, the new Pope came to the balcony again to receive the cheers of the crowd. It has not yet been decided who will succeed him as Secretary of State of the Vatican. It is said that Cardinal Maglione, the former Vatican Ambassador to France, and Cardinal De Teuskini, the former Ambassador to Spain, are the most likely candidates. (Havas, March 2nd)

### Biography of Pius XII

Vatican City: Pope Pius XII was born in Italy on March 2, 1876. The day he was elected was his 63rd birthday. His family was of modest means. After graduating from middle school, he devoted himself to theology. In 1898, he was ordained as a priest and then entered the Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs Conference, serving in the diplomatic group. He was promoted very quickly and held important positions. In 1914, he was appointed President of the Conference by the late Pope Pius X, and he continued in this position after the late Pope Benedict XV took over. He also worked with the late Secretary of State, Cardinal Gaspari, to compile the Holy See Law, which was particularly outstanding. On June 22, 1917, he was promoted to Archbishop and sent to the German state of Bavaria. At that time, the European War was in full swing. Archbishop Pacelli spared no effort to rescue prisoners of war. In 1920, he began negotiations with the Bavarian authorities on a religious treaty, which was not concluded until 1924. In June 1925, he was promoted to Vatican Ambassador to Germany. On December 16, 1929, he was created a Cardinal by the late Pope Pius XI and succeeded Cardinal Gaspari as Secretary of State of the Vatican. Although Cardinal Pacelli was the most outstanding diplomat of the Vatican, he still loved his priestly mission and was humble. He was particularly good at preaching. When he was ordered to be Secretary of State, he repeatedly declined. After taking office, he successively concluded religious treaties with Romania, Austria, Germany, and Yugoslavia, which was a great achievement. Cardinal Pacelli was proficient in French, German, Spanish, and English, and had traveled to many countries, so his reputation became even higher. More recently, in 1934, he went to the capital of Argentina as the Pope's special envoy to attend the World Catholic Conference. In April 1935, he was sent to the city of Lourdes in France to preside over the closing ceremony of the "Holy Mother" year. In 1937, he was sent as a special envoy to the town of Saint-Thérèse in France (the site of the apparition of the Holy Mother) to preside over the completion ceremony of the cathedral. In 1938, he was again sent as a special envoy to the capital of Hungary to attend the World Catholic Conference. He was well received wherever he went. In 1936, on the eve of the US election, Cardinal Pacelli traveled to the United States in a private capacity and held important talks with political figures in the country. Five or six years ago, he also traveled to the Near East on a secret mission. In short, the late Pope Pius XI relied heavily on Cardinal Pacelli. His edict denouncing racism was written by Pacelli. Despite his arduous duties, in his spare time, he often wore the black robes of an ordinary priest and strolled through the streets of Nanhai, admiring the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in the setting sun. His simplicity can be seen in this. (Havas, March 3rd)

### Whether China and Japan Are at War: Different Views Between International Law and Merchants

(London) The Court of Appeal today ruled on a case involving a dispute over "whether there is a war between China and Japan." The case arose when Osaka Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha sued Pengsang Transportation Company in May of last year for canceling the charter contract for the Nelson Meadow in September 1937. Judge Goddard ruled that Pengsang Transportation Company had the right to cancel the contract because a state of war did exist, and in the minds of ordinary merchants, the term "war" could be used without studying the distinctions stipulated by international law. Kawasaki Kaisha was not satisfied and appealed, arguing that the charter contract stipulated that "if a war involving Japan occurs," then the contract could be canceled. However, the British Foreign Office had stated that the British government, in its own view, did not intend to say that a state of war existed. The Court of Appeal judges dismissed the appeal and declared that the original judgment was correct because war could occur without being recognized by the British government. Today, no one dares to say that war cannot exist without a declaration of war. (Reuters, March 2nd)

### Pacelli Elected Pope: Unanimous Welcome from All Countries; Outstanding Talent, Great Popularity, and Will Carry Out the Late Pope's Wishes

(Washington) After Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope, American political figures all expressed their welcome, saying that he was the most suitable candidate to maintain the traditional spirit of Catholicism and resist the new German paganism. At least three things can be guaranteed: (1) The new Pope will continue to promote the political and social policies of the late Popes Pius X and XI. (2) The new Pope will definitely put Catholicism in a leading position on the two issues of ending the Spanish Civil War and resisting racism. (3) As Secretary of State of the Vatican, the new Pope has maintained contact with three-quarters of the world's countries and is also more able to understand the various issues of the United States. Responsible officials said that the US government and the Vatican have severed relations since 1848, which has been ninety years. Cardinal Pacelli came to the United States once in December 1936, and since then, President Roosevelt and other government authorities have repeatedly expressed their desire to restore relations with the Vatican. After Pacelli was elected Pope, this desire will naturally be easier to realize. (Havas, March 2nd)

(New York) After the news of Cardinal Pacelli's election as the new Pope reached here, the general public expressed their welcome. Political figures also said that the new Pope's adoption of Pius as his holy name shows that he approves of peace and freedom, just like the late Pope Pius XI. Cardinal Pacelli visited the United States in October 1936, making him the first Pope in history to visit this land. (Havas, March 2nd)

(Rome) The King of Italy sent a telegram to the new Pope Pius XII, expressing his congratulations. Prime Minister Mussolini also sent a congratulatory telegram. (Haitong, March 3rd)

(Rome) The election of Cardinal Pacelli as the new Pope was expected by the general public here and was not considered unusual. All the newspapers published extra editions, praising the new Pope's personality. Among them, the Italian Daily reported that the College of Cardinals was not subjected to any pressure during this election and elected the new Pope in a completely free environment. (Havas, March 2nd)

(Paris) After Cardinal Pacelli was elected as the new Pope, the world unanimously expressed a warm welcome. All circles in France, especially the people in the lounge of the National Assembly, were deeply impressed. Political figures said that Cardinal Pacelli had come to France twice as the Pope's special envoy in 1935 and 1937 and had very good feelings for France. His election this time and the adoption of Pius as his holy name show that he still wants to follow the policies of the late Pope Pius XI, in other words, to uphold human dignity, freedom, peace, and spiritual values. In addition, important figures from the French opposition parties, such as Mr. Marlan, the leader of the right-wing Republican Union Party, all praised the new Pope. Former Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Grotel, also told a Havas reporter that "no one among the Cardinals who are well-respected can surpass the new Pope." (Havas, March 2nd)

(Paris) After Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope, President Lebrun sent a special telegram to congratulate him, stating briefly, "Now, on behalf of the entire French nation, I offer my congratulations." Prime Minister Daladier also sent a telegram to the Vatican State Council to express his congratulations. (Havas, March 3rd)

(London) London was very happy to hear that Pacelli was elected as the new Pope because his work in harmonizing politics and religion with Germany and Italy is still remembered. Here, everyone says that Pacelli has great power, making people admire him, and he always holds moderate views on political issues. (Reuters, March 2nd)

(London) After Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State of the Vatican, was elected as the Pope, the newspapers here unanimously expressed their joy, saying that he would surely promote the original policies of the late Pope Pius XI. The Times reported, "Cardinal Pacelli's succession to the papacy is said to be in accordance with Pius XI's will. He will definitely inherit the tradition of the unyielding late Pope. In terms of his own aspirations, when he was Secretary of State of the Vatican, he refuted various philosophies, those that "believe in the dogma of iron and blood and racism." Now that he has been elected Pope, the Nazi Party may be alarmed and feel uneasy." (Havas, March 3rd)

(London) After Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope, all circles in Britain unanimously expressed their welcome, saying that he was talented and amiable. Cardinal Pacelli had come to Britain twice. The first time was in 1901, representing the Pope at Queen Victoria's funeral. The second time was in 1911, attending the coronation ceremony of the late King George V. Political figures here also said that Pacelli's election as Pope is a great guarantee that the Vatican will use its political power to strive for justice and peace. (Havas, March 2nd)

(Berlin) Here, there is no surprise at the election of Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State of the Vatican, as the new Pope, and it is considered a purely religious issue with no political significance. German newspapers also maintain a calm attitude, but German Catholics are generally satisfied because Pacelli served as a bishop in Germany from 1917 to 1929 and is quite familiar with the situation and language of Germany. Therefore, they generally hope that Pacelli's succession will reduce the tension between Germany and the Vatican and improve their relations. (Haitong, March 3rd)

Athens: After Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope, the Greek newspapers unanimously published articles expressing their welcome. The Proia reported, "Catholics all over the world are celebrating this news because Pacelli's respect in the world has not been achieved in a day. Now, he is the new pope, which is a great guarantee for the spiritual aspect of the civilized world." (Havas, March 3rd)

Capital of Switzerland: After Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope, Mudar, the President of the Swiss Federal Administrative Council, sent a special telegram to congratulate him, saying, "I hope that His Holiness will be able to smoothly manage Catholics all over the world for a long time under the gaze of peace." (Havas, March 3rd)

Capital of Sweden: All the newspapers today published articles praising the new Pope Pius XII. The Times Daily reported that although Sweden has used Christianity as its state religion for 400 years, there is no doubt that the Roman Catholic Church can represent the world's largest theocracy. (Havas, March 3rd)

Capital of Romania: After Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope, the newspapers here unanimously praised him. Among them, the Times reported that the new Pope had a deep friendship with the Romanian people. The Times also said that the new Pope will bear a very important mission in the international arena in the future. "The Vatican will become a hub of peace, reason, and spiritual health." (Havas, March 3rd)

Capital of Argentina: After Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope, the people of Argentina enthusiastically expressed their welcome. (Havas, March 2nd)

Burgos: After Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope, the general public here warmly welcomed him. Political figures declared that Cardinal Pacelli, while serving as Secretary of State of the Vatican, recognized the National Military Government and always supported our claims. His election as Pope is well-deserved, and he will surely continue to promote the original policies of the late Pope Pius XI for Spain in the future. Responsible officials said that there were two major good news on the 1st of this month: one was Pacelli's election as Pope, and the other was the French government's appointment of General Pétain, a famous general of the European War, as the Ambassador to Spain. (Havas, March 2nd)

### Gandhi's Fast

Rajkot Gandhi began his fast at 6:30 this morning. According to what Gandhi told a Reuters reporter yesterday, he has a final letter to the Prince of Rajkot, asking him to reply within 24 hours to his suggestion for a peaceful resolution of the situation caused by the riots between Hindus and Muslims. If he does not receive a satisfactory reply by then, he will actually begin an indefinite fast. It is said that Gandhi's move is due to the state's failure to fulfill its promise to implement reforms. Gandhi had his last meal an hour before midnight, in a very happy mood. The food he ate was mostly vegetables, and a glass of goat milk. Gandhi informed his wife of the fasting in a letter. His wife is still in Rajkot prison due to passive resistance. The Rajkot King's reply was delivered 90 minutes after Gandhi began his fast. The content indicated that he could not agree to Gandhi's suggestion, and explained the reasons for this decision. According to medical opinion, Gandhi's endurance is very low. (Reuters, March 3rd)

### Funeral of Comrade Lenin's Wife

(Moscow) The funeral of Madam Krupskaya was held today at the Red Square here. The urn containing her ashes was placed in the Hall of Columns of the Trade Unions. Public mourning ended at 3:30 PM. Only a few of Madam Krupskaya's closest friends were allowed to remain in the hall. The final guard of honor consisted of Kaganovich, Yaroslavsky, Shvernik, Badayev, Ordzhonikidze, Uritsky, Deputy Commissar of Defense Kulik, Air Force Commander Loktionov, Soviet heroes Serov, Vorobiev, Khorzhunov, Badukov, Spirin, Denisov, Senatorov and Osipenko. At 4:30 PM, Bulganin, Litvinov, Shvernik, Yaroslavsky, Kaganovich, Petrovsky, Mekhlis, Bochanov, Kulik, Loktionov and Gorkin raised the urn-bearing frame. The urn, placed in the frame, was led by a guard of honor to the Red Square. By then, tens of thousands of citizens had filled the square, united in silence, paying their last respects to this noble and courageous daughter. At the signal of mourning, thousands of people lowered red flags adorned with mourning bands in unison to express grief. At exactly 5:00 PM, the urn-bearing frame arrived at the square and was placed in front of Lenin's Mausoleum. At that time, Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Shvernik, and Bulganin were already standing on the mausoleum platform. The memorial service began immediately. First, Shvernik delivered a eulogy on behalf of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party and the Soviet government. Then, Shcherbakov, Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, spoke on behalf of the working masses, the Moscow City Party Committee, and the Soviet. Leonova, a teacher and member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, also delivered a speech. Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Shiriakov, Yaroslavsky, Shcherbakov, and others raised the urn-bearing frame and carried the urn into the Kremlin walls. After the urn was placed in the niche, a three-gun salute was fired, and the funeral of this generation's female revolutionary was completed. (TASS dispatch, 2nd)

### Another Huge Bombing Discovered in Britain: Irish Republican Army Receives Foreign Funding

(London) Today, someone attempted to blow up a bridge near Winsford, Staffordshire. This terrifying explosion was heard for miles. It occurred at midnight, but it was not until several hours later that powerful explosives were discovered in a culvert of the Birmingham Canal. The outer wall of the culvert had been blown through, but because the breach in the canal bank was small, the water was not able to leak out. If this attempt had been successful, thousands of tons of water would have flooded the surrounding villages and towns. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

Dublin The Minister of Justice of the Irish Free State, Ruttledge, today introduced the second reading of the Offences Against the State Act (designed to deal with the Irish Republican Army) in parliament, stating that it was well known that the Irish Republican Army had weapons, received training, and received funds from a certain country. The country is now very peaceful, but in view of past history and certain evidence, this peace may not last. The government is not afraid of this army, but if it is necessary to deal with these people, the government will not allow anyone to use force to achieve political or social goals. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

### Poland Imitates Others, Demands Colonies to Achieve Equality with Other Countries

Warsaw The Executive Committee of the ruling party passed a resolution today, stating: "Poland must be on an equal footing with other European countries and acquire vast colonies. This will greatly benefit world peace." Observers say that the fact that the ruling party has made a colonial demand after Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Poland is noteworthy. (Havas, 3rd)

Warsaw Following the adoption of a resolution by the Executive Committee of the ruling party demanding colonies, it is rumored that the government will soon establish a colonial bureau, to be headed by Major Rembeki, a confidant of the late General Pilsudski, former Minister of Military Affairs. Major Rembeki also published an article in the "Polish Daily" today, commenting on the resolution passed by the ruling party yesterday, stating that Poland has a surplus population and a lack of raw materials, and must acquire colonies to accommodate the surplus population and obtain the necessary raw materials. Regarding this, "Although we may not be able to achieve our wishes at the moment, it will be easier to start in the future. The only plan is to start actively now, so that we can achieve our goals one day." The conclusion is that Poland is an ally of European countries that cannot be ignored, and it is hoped that the countries concerned will pay attention to it. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

### Czechoslovakia Bans Arms Exports to Soviet Russia, Effective May 1st

Prague According to reliable sources, from May 1st onwards, arms and ammunition will not be allowed to be transported from Czechoslovakia to the Soviet Union. However, the arms ordered by the Soviet Union from Czechoslovakia before September of last year are still being transported to the Soviet Union in accordance with the contract.

### Palestine Issue: Arab Side Proposes Counter-Proposal, Greatly Differing from British Proposal, Triangular Negotiations Still in Progress

(London) According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the Palestine Conference seems to have reached a critical stage. The Jewish delegation has firmly refused to accept the British proposal, and the Arab delegation has also earnestly reiterated the demands made at the opening of the conference, which are far from being agreeable. The British government also has little hope of acceptance, as its purpose is to immediately establish an independent state in Palestine, completely ruled by the Arab nation, which constitutes the majority. The procedure would be to first form a representative assembly jointly by the Arabs and Jews, roughly in proportion to the population, elect a government, immediately take over the rule of Palestine, and draft a law for the organization of the legislative body, in which the Arabs would naturally occupy a majority position. In addition, the Arabs and Jews would formulate a constitution, which may or may not be submitted to the British government, not for approval or amendment, but simply in the hope that an Anglo-Palestinian treaty can be concluded with Britain after the establishment of the independent state of Palestine. According to information obtained by Reuters, the Arab side's counter-proposal has deemed the British proposal to hold a round table conference unnecessary and rejected it. The attitude of Palestine's neighboring Arab countries is noteworthy, as representatives of those countries have actively participated in this matter. However, it is surprising that none of the representatives of those countries participated when the Arab representatives formally presented the counter-proposal at the meeting yesterday. This afternoon, Colonial Secretary MacDonald and Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler met with a subcommittee consisting of two Palestinian Arab representatives and other Arab delegations for an hour and a half to begin a detailed discussion of the British proposal. It is reported that the discussion will continue on Saturday morning. The British side has strongly stated that the government's proposal will continue to be the basis for discussion and will not be modified. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler discussed the attitude of the Jewish delegation with Jewish leader Weizmann in the Prime Minister's lounge in the House of Commons tonight. It is reported that tomorrow afternoon, some Jewish representatives and the British delegation will continue to hold informal talks. It is claimed that MacDonald and Butler met with Foreign Secretary Halifax today to prepare for tomorrow's talks. The meeting between the British and Jewish representatives lasted for about an hour. According to well-informed sources, the Jewish side believes that the British proposal cannot be used as a basis for discussion. As for whether the Jewish side also intends to propose a counter-proposal, it is not yet known, but if it is proposed, the British government will give it full consideration. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

### Guerrilla Forces Swarm in the Eastern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway

(Beiping) According to news received here, the Japanese army is now resuming its offensive in the eastern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, namely the area between the Longhai Railway and the Yangtze River. There have been no battles in this area for 18 months since the summer of 1937. A small number of Japanese troops occasionally passed through it. Now, because Chinese guerrilla forces are swarming in the area, the Japanese army has mobilized its navy, army, and air force to launch a joint offensive. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 3rd)

### International Federation of Trade Unions Opposes Recognition of the Spanish Nationalist Government

(Paris) The executive officers of the International Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting here today and unanimously passed a resolution protesting the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist Government by Britain and France. They also decided to meet in London on March 29th and 30th to discuss whether to launch a large-scale movement to support the convening of an international peace conference. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

Burgos Roche, the assistant political director of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived here this afternoon and immediately notified the Nationalist Government of France's recognition of the Nationalist Government as the legal government and the appointment of Marshal Pétain, a famous general from World War I, as the first ambassador. Diplomatic circles say that Pétain, a famous general in the Battle of Verdun, once met General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist Army, in Morocco. His appointment as French ambassador is a great honor for the Nationalist Government. General Franco must be pleased to reunite with his old friend. After most countries recognize the Nationalist Government, they will send envoys here, but this city is a small town with a lack of facilities, and some departments of the cabinet have moved elsewhere to work, so it will be difficult to accommodate the envoys from various countries. Since Barcelona has not been completely pacified, it is planned to temporarily use the northern port of San Sebastian as the location of the embassies of various countries. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

### Japanese Damage British Interests in China: Britain No Longer Tolerates It, Financial Restriction Regulations on Puppet Organizations Discussed in London Financial Circles: Retaliation Plan, Some Parliamentarians Advocate Taking Practical Action

(London) London authorities and financial circles are paying close attention today to the financial restriction regulations to be implemented in North China. Yesterday, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce, and various banks in the Far East held a joint discussion on a retaliation plan. Some advocated that any exports from North China that do not have a certificate from the consulate, proving that payment was made by a British, American, or French bank, should be prohibited from entering British or British colonial ports. Others believed that any retaliation should be taken as part of a general plan, so that Japan would realize that Britain would no longer tolerate the damage to British interests in China caused by the Japanese. Bankers believe that the restrictive regulations will fail. A financier told a Reuters reporter that you cannot sell something for one shilling and two pence if others are willing to sell it for eight pence. It is also worth noting that Chinese guerrillas are now executing any Chinese found in possession of banknotes from the United Reserve Bank. Members of the House of Commons concerned about Far Eastern affairs will raise questions to the Prime Minister when the House meets next Monday, urging him to take practical action now, as simply lodging protests is clearly ineffective. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)

### Fu Company Obtains Exclusive Tungsten Rights: British Metal Merchants Pay Close Attention, All Tungsten Stock in Hong Kong Has Been Purchased by Fu Company, Rumors of Japanese Occupation of Chinese Tungsten Production Areas Are Untrue

(London) The fact that the Chinese government's National Resources Commission recently granted the exclusive patent rights for tungsten production to Fu Company has become the main topic of discussion among London metal merchants today. In the autumn of last year, Japan publicly declared that it would invade Chinese antimony mines, so they are paying particular attention to the above-mentioned measures. It is rumored that all tungsten stock in Hong Kong has been purchased by Fu Company. If this is true, its value will be over £250,000 in British currency. As the German commodity exchange agreement will automatically expire, it seems that the recent rumor that "Hafpro," the German trade organization for purchasing tungsten, tung oil, and other raw materials in China, has ceased operations is a prescient prediction. The news that Chinese tungsten production areas have been occupied by the Japanese army is believed to be a false rumor. However, there may be difficulties in transporting it to Hong Kong at the moment. (Dispatch, 2nd)

### German-Japanese Negotiations on Economic Agreement: Nature is Very Broad

(Berlin) German economic circles are very enthusiastic about the negotiations between Germany and Japan on an economic agreement. They believe that since the two sides maintain friendly relations politically, they should strengthen them economically. Therefore, the conclusion of an economic agreement is naturally related to the development of friendly relations between the two sides. It is said that the two governments have been negotiating for some time. The aim is not to conclude an ordinary commercial agreement, but a broad economic agreement, which also includes the development of Japanese-occupied areas in China. Generally speaking, Germany will supply trained workers and materials for the development of this area, but due to Germany's lack of technicians and trained workers, this approach seems to be difficult. In addition, both German and Japanese economic circles agree to correct the current trade volume between the two sides, because so far, German goods exported to Japan are four times greater than Japanese goods imported into Germany. Now Japan hopes to increase the trade volume on the one hand, and change the trade ratio from four to one to one to one on the other hand. The authorities here say that Germany is prepared to do its best to eliminate the current difficulties in German-Japanese trade. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)

### Australian Iron Factory Workers Support China: Actually Dismissed

(Chongqing) The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement recently received a report from the Sydney Branch, stating that 3,500 wharf workers in Canberra, Australia, were dismissed by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company for refusing to load scrap iron destined for Japan in November and December of last year. All parties expressed sympathy for their sacrifice for justice. The Australian Seamen's Union has appealed to its members to contribute one shilling each week to purchase goods for the Canberra wharf workers. The New South Wales Labor Council convened a conference, broadcast by radio, and distributed leaflets to support the actions of the Canberra workers. However, as a result, the union and radio station were banned. The telegram from the Seamen's Association approving the Canberra workers' actions was also inspected by the postal and telecommunications authorities. It is said that the banning of the union, radio station, and inspection of telegrams sent to Canberra were all done by Postmaster General Cameron, without prior warning or consultation with government officials. This has aroused protests from all quarters in Australia. Queensland and Tasmania Governor-General Galban, Bishop of Armidale, Canon Garnsey, president of the New South Wales Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement, Watts, editor of the church's standard magazine, Anderson, president of the International Fellowship, the president of the Civil Liberties Association, and the president of the New South Wales Teachers' Federation, as well as members of parliament from the government and opposition parties, and eighteen trade unions, have all strongly criticized this action. All sectors of Australian society also spoke out in support of justice. The Sydney Morning Herald, the Melbourne Age, and the Sydney Daily Telegraph, all organs of the Conservative Party, criticized Cameron. At one time, public sentiment was surging. As a result, after discussions between Federal Prime Minister Lyons and Labor Party leader Curtin, the union's radio station was unsealed, and the authorities issued an apology. The union's radio station has now regained its freedom and continues to support the righteous actions of the Canberra wharf workers. (Dispatch, 3rd)

Travelogue from Eastern Zhejiang (1)

### The People of Zhuji County Filled with Awareness of Resistance and Work Hard to Produce, with a Flourishing Paper Industry, and Over Half of the Able-Bodied Men Have Been Trained

Following the successive falls of Hangzhou and Fuyang last year, eastern Zhejiang became the rear area for Chinese military operations. However, the local order in the counties of eastern Zhejiang remains stable, and it is evident that the social institutions in eastern Zhejiang are improving, the consciousness of national revival is being elevated, and the production of agriculture and handicrafts continues to maintain its inherent strength. Based on observations from various aspects, it can be said that every unit in eastern Zhejiang has a complete organization. I, the reporter, traveled from Zhuji to Yiwu, and then took the highway through Dongyang, Fangyan, Yongkang, and finally to Jinhua and Lanxi for about ten days. I will now selectively record the situation in various places and my observations along the way, so that the readers of this newspaper can gain a general impression of the advancing eastern Zhejiang.

Arriving in Zhuji

When I, the reporter, arrived in Zhuji County, it was noon. After getting off the bus, I was eager to find a hostel in the city, but the station was full of soldiers in military uniforms, questioning every traveler in detail about where they came from, what they were doing, and where they were going. They also carefully searched the travelers' luggage. Of course, we were no exception. It took more than a quarter of an hour before we were allowed to leave the station. It was the first time for me, the reporter, to experience such a detailed inspection on a journey. It was about five *li* from the station to the city. Sitting in a rickshaw towards the city, I could see a dark ancient city wall from afar. Huge slogans written on the city wall clearly caught my eye. After entering the city, slogans were pasted on the walls of houses along the way, covering up the advertisements. I, the reporter, stayed at the Central Hotel in Xueqian Lake Alley. After placing my simple luggage, I went to the market to find a restaurant. The county seat of Zhuji was not very lively. Passing through Qianhu Lake, I saw several pharmacies and bookstores. The shop windows displayed several pamphlets and pictorials about the war, as well as one or two magazines, but they were long overdue. The county government, the Public Security Bureau, the County Hospital, and the local court were all located together, and they were in the busiest part of the market, so they had been bombed several times, but the city appearance was still complete. I asked a policeman where there was a restaurant. He carefully looked me over and volunteered to take me to a "Yuelai Restaurant" by the moat. I thanked him, and he politely said goodbye and left. However, before we could order, the policeman brought two police officers and said, "Are you new here? Please come to the Public Security Bureau once." When asked why, I learned that local collaborators were often found impersonating travelers to gather information, so the authorities had to inspect anyone suspicious. I showed my documents and explained the misunderstanding. I not only admired the policeman's vigilance, but also praised the strict security management in the area.

Production Status

Zhuji County, including the city, townships, and various districts, has a total of 113,820 households with a population of 509,927. The total land area of the county is 8,398 square *li*, with an average population density of 61 people per square *li*. However, the current population has increased because many people have moved here from Hangzhou and Fuyang due to the war. In terms of production, agricultural products are the most important in Zhuji County. There are 130,000 farmers in the county. According to the estimate of the Industrial Department of the County Government, the annual output of ordinary crops in this county has occupied an important position in eastern Zhejiang since the war, about 5,266,400 *dan*. Among them, the important products are rice 1,969,280 *dan*, barley 212,140 *dan*, wheat 445,540 *dan*, and corn 148,796 *dan*. Secondly, in terms of handicrafts, there is papermaking. Because most of the paper mills in Fuyang have stopped production, the local paper industry has been quite good in recent years and has made progress. Due to the increase in the purchase price by paper merchants, the paper mills can still make profits. Regarding the training of able-bodied men, Zhuji County also has excellent results. According to a survey, there are currently 285,103 men in the county, of which 33.80 percent, or 96,377 people, are of able-bodied age. Due to the active implementation of the Able-Bodied Men Training Regulations promulgated by the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, half of them have been trained. The best results have been achieved by civil servants and elementary school teachers in various townships, who have all been mobilized for training. Secondly, regarding the organization for resistance against Japan, there is a rescue team in the urban area, which has been established for a year. The rescue personnel are local people, and the work is divided into rescue, stretcher, and anti-poisoning teams, which are dispatched to serve in different areas during air raids. In terms of propaganda, the People's Education Center is responsible for important tasks. Every day, simple war news wall newspapers are posted in public gathering places such as cities, towns, teahouses, and restaurants. At the same time, personnel are sent to various townships every week to conduct propaganda speeches, instilling in the villagers the common sense they should have during wartime and understanding the meaning of resistance against Japan. According to Qiu, the director of the County Hospital, they have gone to the countryside to promote various first aid and anti-poisoning knowledge, and the results have been excellent.

Hometown of Xi Shi

Zhuji has two famous scenic spots, one is Wu Xie (Five Cascades), and the other is the hometown of Xi Shi. Xi Shi's hometown, the village of Zhuyun, is only five *li* away from the city. I, the reporter, went out of the city to visit it. There is Luo Mountain, overlooking the Huansha River, which is the former residence of the beauty Xi Shi. By the river, there is the Huansha Stone. According to the villagers, this is where Xi Shi washed silk. The scenery here is very beautiful, the river water is clear and green, and very shallow. The fine stones and gold sands at the bottom can be seen. It has the same mood as Xi Shi, the unparalleled beauty. To the east is the Xi Shi Temple, built by the local people to honor Xi Shi. Indeed, at that time, King Goujian of Yue used Xi Shi to defeat the enemy and succeeded. In today's terms, such a patriotic woman is even more worthy of our remembrance. Wu Xie, which is Wu Pu (Five Waterfalls), is a famous scenic spot in eastern Zhejiang, originating from Zilang in Fuyang. Some people call it "Little Yandang", and its beauty can be imagined. Going out of the city, it is twenty-five kilometers long. Midway, there is Caota Town, which is an important town in Zhuji County, and its prosperity is no less than that of the county seat. In this town, it is simply impossible to see that it is in the rear of the war. The teahouses and restaurants are full of people, and the streets are crowded with people. The shop windows of several foreign goods stores are posted with slogans such as "We do not sell inferior goods" and "Victory in the war of resistance, boycott enemy goods!" In this small town, their patriotic enthusiasm is already very evident. I, the reporter, returned from Wuxie Temple in the evening. Because I could not return to the county seat in time, I stayed in Caota Town. (To be continued)

### The Su Guerrilla Force Captures Daqiao

Zhenjiang Correspondence: On the 21st, the Japanese army divided its forces into three routes to jointly attack the base area of Fang's troops in Daqiao. One route landed at Sanjiangying, and another route landed at Wuxu, both using small motorboats to transport about 300 people. Another route was drawn from Yangzhou, passing through Yiling Zhangjianggou, with about 100 people. At that time, there were three Japanese aircraft flying in the sky to show off, but they did not drop bombs. In order to avoid sacrifice, Fang's troops dispersed and retreated to a safe area. After the Japanese army arrived, they found nothing, so they burned down the Chamber of Commerce and the Dutian Temple, and extorted money from the residents. After Fang's troops retreated, they actively deployed, and the chief of special affairs, Wang Zhengcheng, led his troops to surround Daqiao and launched a general attack on the 23rd. Seeing that they could not resist, the Japanese army retreated along the waterway. In a hurry, the Chinese army intercepted many weapons and killed dozens of Japanese soldiers.

### Intense Battle Between Chinese and Japanese Armies in Xinshi Town

Xinshi Correspondence: Xinshi Town, which belongs to Huzhou, has always been controlled by a certain division of the Chinese army and Zhu Xi's troops. On the morning of the 25th of last month, the Japanese army dispatched troops from Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Tongxiang, including the Xia'an, Jutian, and Kumagai units, and invaded by land and water. Upon hearing the news, the Chinese army immediately intercepted them in Caocun. Due to the disparity in strength, the Chinese army retreated to the outside of the four fences of Xinshi Town, relying on solid fortifications. The two sides fought fiercely until about 1:00 PM, when the Japanese army could not hold out and retreated. The Chinese side took advantage of the victory and pursued, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers and seizing countless spoils. At about 4:00 PM, the Japanese army again invaded by land and water, with a team of aircraft covering them, dropping dozens of bombs in the sky, destroying dozens of civilian houses. In order to avoid sacrifice, the Chinese army retreated. The Japanese army took the opportunity to enter the town, searching house to house. Many young men were killed, and women, regardless of age, were raped. The next morning, a certain unit of the Chinese army rushed into Caocun to fight the Japanese army. Upon hearing the alarm, the Japanese army, in addition to hastily fighting back, immediately burned all the houses in the village and fled to Xinshi Town. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to surround the four fences of the town, and they are still in a stalemate.

### Dinghai Fish Transported to Shanghai

Ningbo Correspondence: On the 24th, the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters summoned representatives of the Ding County fish industry to determine the method of transporting fish to Shanghai. It is learned that the representatives of the Ding County fish industry, Che Maoquan and Huang Junrong, visited Commander Guo of the Garrison Headquarters again on the afternoon of the 25th, and decided on two measures: (1) Establish a fish transportation and sales office in Dinghai to be responsible for the unified control of Ding Shi's fish production; (2) Hire the Hana and Haifu ships as special fish transportation ships, which can be operated after approval by the General Headquarters.

### Chinese Army Deploys on Various Lines in Guangdong, Situation Near Guangzhou Becomes Increasingly Tense, No Japanese Troops in Zhangmutou and Other Places

Shantou Correspondence: According to Xingning news, the war on the northeastern Jiang front has suddenly become tense. Goods collected by Shaoguan, Yingde, Lechang, and Hakka merchants in Xingning are packed overnight and transported north via southern Jiangxi. Because the lines of Laolong, Heyuan, Zhongxin, Lianping, and Wengyuan are crowded with military vehicles, our side has deployed large troops to various lines, numbering over 100,000. A major battle may occur in the suburbs of Guangzhou. It was found that in the latter half of last month, the Japanese army was extremely busy mobilizing on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway and Guangzhou-Sanshui Highway, with cars driving all night, transporting troops to the Guangzhou-Zengcheng Highway. The number of troops moved was at least 10,000. The Japanese troops originally stationed in Zengcheng, Zhengguo, Futian, and other places have been reorganized and stationed in Shilong and Shitan. Solid defensive fortifications have been built on the Guangzhou-Huaxian Road. The Japanese troops in Guangzhou City have all been transferred to Huaxian and Conghua, firmly guarding their strongholds, with 10,000 infantry and artillery soldiers, distributed in Taipingchang, Shingang, and Xinzhu Village, confronting our Dagang defense army. There are occasional minor contacts. On the West River, the war has gradually become tense since the 22nd. The Japanese army is building pontoon bridges on the Jiujiang riverbank, passing through Gubu, intending to attack Jinli and control the lower reaches of the West River, attempting to threaten Wuzhou. Our side was prepared early, and the Wang Dequan, Chen Gongxia, and Zhang Chi divisions of the Ninth Army Group under Deng Longguang are now deployed in Zhaoqing, Gaoyao, Heshan, and Xinhui. Our guerrillas have penetrated into the Sanyanqiao, Qicha, and Yanbu areas along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road. The Japanese army on the east, west, and north roads has made no progress due to insufficient troops. They have changed to sending planes to distribute leaflets in the eastern Guangdong area, threatening various village pseudo-autonomous organizations, but none responded. Iijima, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Humen, once formed a "mopping-up team." On the 17th, about 300 people were dispatched from Taiping, entered Nantou City along the Baoda Road, and retreated to Xixiang to board ships and return to Taiping because our guerrillas were strong. The Okazaki unit of the Japanese army in Dongguan occupied Chashan on the same day, marched south along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Road to Changping Station, and built defensive fortifications. On the 20th, they sent troops to various villages and towns, reaching the vicinity of Bao'an Market near Dalang. The people came out to resist, and all the shops and houses in the market were burned and looted. The Japanese army encountered resistance every time they entered a township, and dared not stay long. In the end, they set fire and looted before leaving. All the villages visited by the Japanese army were turned into scorched earth. Below Changping, the market towns of Zhangmutou, Pinghu, Guanlan, and Buji to Shenzhen have not seen the footprints of the Japanese army. However, Japanese aircraft must bomb and explode in the above-mentioned places every day. The magnificent villages were turned into scorched earth in an instant. On the 24th, nine Japanese aircraft flew near Shenzhen, Pinghu, and Guanlan, dropping more than ten bombs. The people had already dispersed and fled, and there were not many casualties. The inhumane massacre of defenseless villages by Japanese aircraft can be seen with a telescope on the top of the British boundary mountain. It has caused deep stimulation in Hong Kong.

### Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Denounce Zhang Yongfu

Vietnam Correspondence: Zhang Yongfu, the director of the Shantou Bridge Affairs Bureau, previously telegraphed the Central Government, expressing sympathy for Wang Jingwei's scandalous telegram. Yan Zijun, a member of the Standing Committee of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association in southern Vietnam, issued a circular on February 12, strongly criticizing him, stating that since Wang has betrayed, he has been abandoned by all levels of the Chinese government and has become a sinner for all time. Now, Zhang Yongfu, in order to repay his personal favor, disregards the interests of the nation and foolishly attempts to shake the increasingly strong belief of the entire nation with a treacherous word, only to see his efforts fail, etc. From this, it can be seen that the overseas Chinese have a very firm belief in the resistance against Japan.

### Chinese Army Attacks Yuhang, Captures Baota Mountain and Other Places

Yuhang Correspondence: The military affairs in the Hangzhou-Fuyang area are currently under the command of the Chinese army under Liu Jianxu. The guerrilla forces in the mountains have also been organized. One day, a certain division of Liu's troops attacked Yuhang and engaged in a fierce battle with more than 100 Japanese soldiers of the Shise unit who were entrenched in Zhushan in Shenjiawu. The Chinese army sacrificed one company commander and nine soldiers. The Japanese army suffered even more casualties. The Chinese army tracked down and attacked, recovering Baota Mountain, Panban Bridge, and Zishan. The artillery positions set up by the Japanese army in the three places were all captured by the Chinese army. The suburbs of Yuhang are full of power grids. The Hangzhou-Changxing Road from Daguan to Changqiao and the Yuhang-Changxing Road from Changqiao to Yuhang have been destroyed by the Chinese army with earthworks on the 19th and cannot be used for traffic.

### Japanese Army in Wuxi Intercepted Midway, Two Armies' Vehicles Fall into River

Wuxi Express: At about 2:00 PM on the 28th of last month, more than 200 soldiers from the Japanese Banben headquarters, divided into four military vehicles, attempted to go to a certain northeast township to suppress guerrillas. However, as the four vehicles were traveling on the Wuxi-Shanghai Highway, when they reached the Duck City Bridge, about 20 *hua li* from the city, the bridge surface suddenly collapsed, and the vehicle fell into the river. Seeing that the vehicle in front had an accident, the second vehicle tried to stop, but it was too late, and it also fell into the river with the vehicle and soldiers. After braking, the third vehicle was not involved in the accident. While the Japanese soldiers who had fallen into the river were trying to rescue themselves ashore, gunfire suddenly became concentrated all around. The Japanese soldiers in the third and fourth vehicles were shot and fell to the ground one after another. The two sides fought fiercely for about an hour. The Japanese soldiers suffered about 80 to 90 casualties, while the Chinese side suffered more than a dozen casualties.

### Japanese Army in Qingsong Commits Crimes on Tianma Mountain

Qingpu Correspondence: Since Yuan Yingjie's troops were stationed in Tianma Mountain Town, which belongs to Qingpu County, their momentum has become increasingly strong, and they have constantly dealt blows to the Japanese army. One day, the Japanese side dispatched more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops, carrying four small steel cannons, more than ten light and heavy machine guns, and a large number of hand grenades, divided into nine motorboats, and joined the Japanese army stationed in Songjiang to attack the town. They landed at Xinzhen, about three *li* from Tianma Mountain, and ordered skirmishes to advance. When they reached the back of Tianma Mountain, they indiscriminately fired small steel cannons and machine guns. The Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army under intense artillery fire, and finally defeated the Japanese army. Just as the Chinese army was triumphing, gunfire suddenly broke out behind them. It turned out that more than 200 Japanese and puppet troops from Song County had arrived by civilian boats. The Chinese army was unprepared and had to retreat temporarily into the valley. The Japanese and puppet troops used hand grenades to attack and chase. At this time, the Chinese army from nearby Hengshan and Xiao Kunshan Mountain heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue. Yuan's troops received this assistance and launched a full-scale attack. Seeing the critical situation, the Japanese and puppet troops in Qingpu immediately fled by motorboat first, while the Japanese and puppet troops in Songjiang suffered a head-on blow from the troops in Hengshan and Xiao Kunshan Mountain because the civilian boats were slow. Therefore, there were more than 100 casualties, and the Japanese police captain, Rikida, was also killed in action. In this battle, the Chinese army captured a total of four small steel cannons, six machine guns, and countless rifles and hand grenades. However, more than 30 soldiers of the Chinese army's Yuan unit also made heroic sacrifices.

### New Budget for Zhejiang Province This Year Short by 12 Million, Income in the 27th Year Exceeded Budget

Jinhua Correspondence: The Zhejiang Provincial Government has commenced the 28th year and all agencies' new budget. After the representatives of the various halls were convened to review, the revised proposals were presented by the Provincial Government to the 1034th meeting. At this moment, the accounting office of the province will compile and complete the bills, and will transfer the papers to the Central Government for review, approval, and records. The total amount of revenue and expenditure is 39,474,543 yuan, of which the deficit is more than 12 million yuan, which will be temporarily compensated by loans. The Provincial Government is planning to open up new sources of revenue to increase income. The revenue and expenditure of the 27th year was originally about 8 million yuan different. Later, the tax revenue exceeded the quota, and the increased revenue from salt collection and cigarette management was quite large, so the estimated deficit was only 2 million yuan. According to the reports recently received by the province for the 27th year, the total amount of land tax and deed tax was 3,500,197 yuan (including 2,555,672 yuan in new tax, 541,573 yuan in arrears, and 382,950 yuan in deed tax). The total amount of various businesses was 3,382,513 yuan, all exceeding the original budget amount. The excellent results were unexpected.

### Wenling Youth Petition to Enlist, More Than 40 People Go to the County to Serve

Wenling Correspondence: More than 40 young people from Henghe Township in this county, led by the young patriot Li Yanding, arrived in the city a few days ago to register with the county government to volunteer to go to the front line to participate in the war. The County Anti-Japanese Defense Committee decided to send personnel to greet them outside the East Gate and prepare lunch to entertain them in order to inspire morale. It also sent a letter to the county government to inform various agencies, military police schools, groups, and shops to prepare a grand welcome. The political work team also mobilized women's literacy class students to rush to make towels and distribute them to the brave soldiers who volunteered to enlist.

Li Mingxian and Li Mingyuan, two brothers from Linhai Chengguan Township, recently went to the county government together, volunteering to serve the country. The county government believes that the patriotic enthusiasm of the two brothers is commendable, and has specially requested the superiors to commend them and approve a public banquet to encourage others.

### The Puppet Organization in Hangzhou Exploits in Various Ways, Levying Advertisement Donations Without Exception

Hangxian Correspondence: The Hangzhou puppet government has recently been ordered by the puppet "Revival Government" to cancel the department store donation. With no source of expenditure, in addition to forcibly numbering the doors of civilian houses and charging one yuan for each number, it is also actively formulating harsh taxes. It is learned that harsh donations and advertisement donations were officially levied on the first of this month. The collection methods are divided into three types: A. Ordinary paper, one yuan per *chi* for each square *chi*, two yuan per *chi* for three to five square *chi*, and four yuan per *chi* for more than five square *chi*. B.

C. Parading advertisements, one *jiao* per person per day, doubled for those with musical instruments.

### Guerrilla Forces Extremely Active, Japanese Army Steps Up Alert, Bridges in Hongkou Strengthened with Guards and Fortifications, South Huangpu Ferry Blockaded, Police in Both Concessions Search Passengers Landing

In the Hongkou District, because the Chinese army's guerrillas in the four suburbs have been unusually active recently, the Japanese army has added barbed wire and set up double posts at various bridges such as Qiujiang Wharf, Jiaxing Road Bridge, Yokohama Bridge, Zhonghong Bridge, Lihong Bridge, Oujia Road Bridge, Xiangyan Bridge, and Hujiamu Bridge, as well as at intersections, since the first day of this month. Several hundred new soldiers from the Northern Railway Station have also been stationed, and a transport ship with more than 400 Japanese soldiers arrived at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, disembarked in Nanshi, carrying portable machine guns and several small steel cannons, and were stationed in Tushanwan, South Railway Station, and Gezhu Elementary School.

Strict Searches on the Bund

Because of recent terrorist incidents in the French Concession, the police department of the French Concession has stationed a large number of detectives at the docks along the Bund. All passengers landing at the ferry are subject to strict searches to avoid unfortunate incidents. The Central Police Station of the Public Concession has also dispatched 20 to 30 Chinese, Western, and Indian armed police, with four or five people stationed at each dock, to search all passengers boarding and disembarking, paying particular attention to the Copper Man and New Customs docks (where passengers disembark and board the South Wharf and Pudong Ferry). The water police department has also dispatched patrol boats to patrol the old port (i.e., Suzhou Creek).

Fierce Fighting in Tinglin and Yeshe

The situation in southern Pudong is that the Japanese army stationed there has been transferred elsewhere, leaving it quite empty. The guerrillas are taking the opportunity to be active. There have been contacts in Tinglin, Yeshe, and other places for days. Tinglin Town is a stronghold on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. After the four trucks of the Japanese army, a total of more than 70 people, were led into Tinglin by Ding Xishan's troops, they dismantled seven or eight bridges and then joined the regular army to encircle and attack. The Japanese army was annihilated. More than 100 reinforcements were in fierce fighting. Therefore, on the days before yesterday, the Japanese army in Shanghai and Pudong were successively transported by boat from the South Huangpu to provide assistance. The South Huangpu route has also been blockaded. The Minfang Xingmian area was once attacked by guerrillas, and the Japanese side has stepped up its alert. People traveling in the area without a pass will be detained. All ferries in Puxu, except Dujiahang and Wangjiadu, which have ferries in operation, Deshenggang, Yangsiqiao, Guanxing, Miaogang, and other ferries are still blockaded and have not been restored.

### Shanghai Municipal Council and Japanese Side Agreed on Cooperation Principles Council Has Second Reply; Prisoner Exchange Also Agreed Upon West District's Gambling and Opium Not Mentioned

According to the Dalu Bao, it was learned from high-ranking Japanese sources last night (the 2nd) that the Japanese Navy, Army, and diplomatic authorities have, in principle, reached an agreement with the Shanghai Municipal Council on a more effective public concession police plan. Council Chairman Fessenden will send a second reply to the Japanese representative this morning (the 3rd) regarding the recent terrorist atrocities in Shanghai, stating the Council's proposal, which the Japanese representative has reportedly agreed to. It is said that after receiving instructions from Tokyo four days ago, the Japanese side's "demands" to the Council have become much more moderate, and a half-hour meeting between the two sides at noon yesterday finally reached an agreement. In summary, after this agreement, police officers from the Japanese consulate, Japanese military police, and public concession police will fully cooperate. Representatives from all three parties agree that any party will have the right to request the other party or both parties to jointly carry out their duties. The prisoner exchange issue, in terms of public concession police, was one of the most difficult issues to resolve. Now, this point has also been agreed upon. Although the details are not yet known, it is heard that prisoners arrested by the Japanese side or the public concession authorities will be handed over to the other party as long as legal evidence is presented by one party. In this regard, it is recalled that in the past, the public concession authorities often refused to hand over criminals or civilians who the Japanese authorities claimed had committed political crimes and requested extradition because the Japanese side failed to provide satisfactory evidence. Since the Chinese army withdrew from the suburbs of Shanghai, the public concession authorities have been unable to enter the "Great Road" area to arrest criminals. It is heard that after this agreement, they will be allowed to enter the area again and closely cooperate to arrest criminals. However, this agreement has failed to cure the biggest sore of the city suburbs. The issue of the West District, known as the "badlands of Shanghai," was not mentioned at all. It is said that the situation regarding gambling dens and the opium trade was only mentioned once in the repeated meetings. The Japanese authorities believe that these places are another issue, completely unrelated to political terrorist cases. The Japanese authorities do not intend to take any concrete actions against the opium dens and gambling dens adjacent to the concession boundary.

### National Products Review Committee to Soon Begin Reviewing A Committee of 21 Review Members to Implement After Regulations are Issued

After the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government appointed national product review committees in various provinces and cities, the 21 members in Shanghai have all received their letters of appointment. However, due to the fact that the review regulations have not yet been issued, the committee has been unable to be established at an earlier date. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China Industrial Federation, the Machine-Made National Products Factory Federation, and the Shanghai National Products Silk Factory Federation have decided to convene a meeting of the entire review committee after the regulations are issued, to officially establish the review committee and implement the review of national product outputs.

### Ningbo Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Requesting Approval for Sausage Casing Exports Hundreds of Thousands of Yuan Exported Annually; Requesting Zhejiang Customs to Inspect and Release as Usual

Regarding the government's ban on the export of 54 types of Zhejiang Province's local products to Shanghai, after repeated telegrams from the Shanghai and Ningbo Chambers of Commerce and various industries, six types of goods, including cotton paper, have been permitted for export, provided that the local Chamber of Commerce provides proof guaranteeing that the goods will not be used to aid the enemy, and they will be inspected and released. Now, the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce has sent a special telegram to the Ministries of Finance and Economics regarding sausage casings, which are also goods for export, requesting that they be treated as an example, the original text of which states: "To Minister of Finance Kong, Minister of Economic Affairs Weng, Respected Sirs, According to a letter from Yinxian Sausage Merchants Xie Xing and other sausage factories, after inspecting the list of goods designated as prohibited from being transported to aid the enemy, sausage casings are also on the list of prohibited items, causing great panic. After inspecting, sausage casings have always been sold to European and American countries for the production of food. There are records at customs and the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau that can be used as proof. They seem to be different from other prohibited items. Moreover, small intestines are used for waste utilization and are one of Zhejiang Province's exported local products. Tens of thousands of people in the interior rely on this for their livelihood, and the annual output of the entire country is more than several million yuan, making it a major international trade. It is a business that, like the six types of approved goods such as cotton paper, is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Moreover, sausage casings cannot be stored for a long time. Once the ban is implemented, the goods purchased for foreign exchange will immediately rot and spoil, causing merchants to suffer losses, and it will have a major impact on the government's implementation of foreign exchange settlement for export goods and the fundamental purpose of promoting the concentration of foreign exchange for export. It is proposed to transfer the telegram to the Ministries of Finance and Economics, approving the sausage casings to follow the proof method for cotton paper and other goods, and to sell and settle foreign exchange and load them for export, so as to benefit export and alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The difficult situation of Jiangsu merchants and others, according to the investigation, is that sausage casings are an important export from our country. During this period of resistance, it is appropriate to promote local goods and exchange them for foreign exchange in order to lay the foundation for the wartime economy. The request to approve the handling in accordance with the example of cotton paper, etc., is indeed a necessary plan. The reason is that we respectfully telegraph to the Ministries for review and approval, and instruct the Zhejiang Customs to inspect and release as usual, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties."

Doing Good is the Greatest Joy

### Greek Ship "Livorno" Arrives in Shanghai and is Detained by Japanese Currently Anchored in Yangshupu; Unloading Prohibited; Greek Consul-General Lodged Representation with Japanese Yesterday

The Greek merchant ship "Livorno," represented by the Norwegian firm Wah Lun & Co., which loaded general cargo in Tianjin and sailed to Shanghai, was detained by the Japanese in Yangshupu the day before yesterday. The company has reported to the Greek Consul-General in Shanghai, who lodged a representation with the Japanese authorities yesterday, demanding its prompt release. Details are noted below:

Sailing from Tianjin, Suddenly Detained

The merchant ship "Livorno" has a gross tonnage of 1,765 tons, a net tonnage of 1,049 tons, built in 1903, and is represented by the Norwegian firm Wah Lun & Co., located at the corner of Guangdong Road and Sichuan Road. It loaded about 2,000 tons of general cargo, such as soybean oil, soybeans, mung beans, and cotton yarn, in Tianjin and sailed to Shanghai. After entering the Wusongkou at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, it prepared to dock at the Longmao Warehouse pier in Pudong to unload its cargo. When it sailed to the Japanese Navy pier in Yangshupu, it was ordered to be detained by the Japanese Navy and forced to anchor at the Yangshupu Bridge mid-stream buoy.

Greek Consul-General Lodged Representation Yesterday

After Wah Lun & Co. received the report from the shipowner, the company immediately reported to the Greek Consulate-General in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Greek Consul-General lodged a serious representation with the Japanese side, demanding its prompt release. It is heard that the ship is currently detained at the Yangshupu Bridge mid-stream buoy, and the Japanese side has prohibited the unloading of the cargo it is carrying. The shipowner and Chinese crew members are all on board. It is heard that the Japanese side did not explain the reasons for the detention to the shipowner in advance, nor did it announce them afterward. General observations suggest that the Japanese detention is to investigate the ship's nationality, as the ship was sold by a Chinese businessman to a Greek businessman.

### British and American Quakers Establish a Center in Shanghai Have Sent Three People to Study its Possibility

According to the Dalu Bao, the British and American Quaker Society is about to establish a Quaker Center in Shanghai, with the aim of conducting relief activities in China. To carry out this plan, the Quaker Societies of Britain and the United States have sent three members to Shanghai to study the possibilities here. The first to arrive was a Briton, Mr. Silkirk, yesterday (the 2nd).

He told reporters that the other two, Mr. Holtkin of Britain and Mr. Bolton of America, will arrive later. The British Quaker Society has been considering establishing a center in Shanghai for more than ten years. In the current critical situation, this move is especially needed, so it was decided to immediately organize a center in Shanghai. Mr. Silkirk has served at the British Quaker Society Center in Chengdu for twelve years. Speaking on behalf of his group, he said that they have not yet drafted a precise plan for working in Shanghai. They now hope to carefully examine the situation here and get advice from experienced people here. In addition to participating in relief activities, the Shanghai center also intends to engage in tasks that conform to the society's doctrines. According to reports, the Quaker Society now has centers in Germany, France, and Czechoslovakia, and engages in relief work on both sides of the Spanish Nationalist and government armies. It has also been engaged in religious work in various parts of China for many years. American Quakers are active in Nanjing and its vicinity, while British Quakers are working in western China. There are currently about twenty Chinese and British-American Quakers living in Shanghai.

### Yu Tang People's Education Center, etc., Suffer Significant Losses Four Truckloads of Internal Machinery Moved Away by Japanese Troops

The Japanese troops stationed in Beiqiao on the Shanghai-Minhang Road mobilized four trucks the night before last (the 1st) and drove to Yu Tang, emptying the people's education center and the Yu Tang cooperative there of cotton, rice, and various rice milling and oil pressing machines, causing significant losses.

### Overseas Chinese Donations Unwavering Over Time Donation Locations Spread Across Five Continents

Since the outbreak of the war, overseas Chinese, in addition to supporting the government's policy of resisting aggression and building the country, have provided tremendous assistance in the development of finance and industry, enthusiastically contributing without wavering over time, which is of no small benefit to the future of the war effort. In terms of the types of donations from overseas Chinese, in addition to all the currency they possess, they have contributed gold and silver, or rice and grain, and valuable securities to the best of their ability. According to a survey report by overseas Chinese organizations, from July of the year before last to June of last year, overseas donations for disaster relief and charitable donations, statistically by continent, were: Asia 32,414,565.61 yuan, Americas 4,664,998.93 yuan, Europe 251,480.32 yuan, Oceania 1,050,696.90 yuan, Africa 821,502.48 yuan, provisional donations 4,482,974.412 yuan.

### Japanese Suddenly Prevent British Ships from Resuming Navigation to Funing Claim Military Action Will Be Taken There; HSBC and Kailin Decide to Divert to Tianjin

Regarding the Shanghai-Funing route, since Japanese warships indiscriminately harassed the mouth of the Sheyang River and arbitrarily hijacked three foreign ships, Haida, Hafawa, and Yongzhen, operating on the route to Qingdao, the route's shipping was completely interrupted, and all goods shipped from Shanghai to northern Jiangsu were backlogged. The British ships HSBC and Kailin, in order to restore navigation on the route, were originally scheduled to sail directly to Hexingzhen on the morning of the 2nd. However, they suddenly received a notice from the British Consulate, stating that it had received a notice from the Japanese side that the Japanese army would be taking military action in northern Jiangsu, and therefore hoped that foreign ships would not sail to Funing to avoid danger, etc. Therefore, the HSBC and Kailin ships decided to suspend the resumption of navigation. The Kailin ship is scheduled to divert to Tianjin today, and the HSBC ship will also divert to Tianjin within the next week. Furthermore, according to inquiries from a reporter from the Modern News Agency, the Chinese troops stationed in various counties along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu have greatly increased in strength after being trained and reorganized by the 24th Army Group, and their equipment and ammunition are sufficient, and their military appearance is orderly, thus posing a severe threat to the Japanese army. In order to attempt to "pacify," the Japanese army has reinforced various ports for days and has moved Japanese warships to the downstream. However, the Chinese army is determined to sacrifice and will give a painful blow if the enemy invades. Also, according to news, last night, the Japanese naval authorities suddenly notified that third-country ships were not allowed to sail from Shanghai to Funing, and stated that third-country ships should leave 40 nautical miles from the mouth of the Sheyang River before dawn on the 4th, otherwise the Japanese navy would not be responsible for any losses suffered. Now, the Luji Kailin ship and the Hefeng HSBC ship have decided to suspend sailing from Shanghai to Funing.

### Repeated Failures of Japanese Puppet Regime; Attempt to Manage Foreign Exchange Again Legal Tender Circulates Fully Throughout North China Legal Tender in Various Guerrilla Areas Actually Contains Added Water

After the Japanese puppet regime's attempt to have the "United Reserve Bank of China" banknotes replace legal tender in North China and obtain foreign exchange failed, it forced the devaluation of legal tender in North China and stipulated that its circulation would be prohibited starting March 10th. Now, legal tender is circulating as usual in various parts of North China, deeply trusted by Chinese and foreign people. The number of people collecting legal tender is increasing daily. Legal tender in the Tianjin concession and various guerrilla areas actually contains added water and is more valuable than "United Reserve Bank" coupons. The plan to prohibit the circulation of legal tender has once again been shown to be fruitless. The Japanese puppet regime is again attempting to unify finance, and has actually stipulated that it will manage foreign exchange in North China starting March 10th, with the following regulations: (1) Foreign goods obtained by banks designated by the "government" will be concentrated in the "United Reserve Bank of China." (2) Inward and outward exchange rates will be calculated at 1 shilling and 2 pence. (3) Exports of 1 shilling and 2 pence without proof of foreign exchange transactions from banks designated by the government will not be allowed to clear customs. (4) Imports and exports to central and southern China will be treated the same as foreign countries. It has also set up "Foreign Exchange Management Bureaus" in various parts of North China.

### A Chinese Youth Arrested After Disembarking from Portuguese Ship Japanese Side Actually Believes He Is a Terrorist and Claims He Came to Shanghai from Chongqing

According to the Dalu Xinbao, a Japanese newspaper, yesterday (the 2nd), it was reported that on Wednesday (the 1st) evening, a Chinese youth was about to disembark from a Portuguese ship. Because the white shirt he was wearing was the uniform of the "Patriotic Loyalty Association," he was believed to be a terrorist and was arrested and taken into custody. There were other signs that could prove that he was a terrorist, as a "directive on terror personally signed by Chairman Chiang, anti-Japanese leaflets, and secret documents" were found on him and in his luggage. The Dalu Xinbao also believes that the youth came from Chongqing and was establishing contact with terrorist groups in Shanghai. The youth was spotted by a Japanese customs patrol, who arrested him. The Japanese side believes that another Chinese person, an accomplice of the youth, has escaped.

### Nanyang Overseas Chinese Organization National Products Inspection Team Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday A Group of Nine People, Including Lin Hongxing, Will Visit Major Factories

Overseas Chinese from Nanyang, in order to introduce national products to promote overseas markets, specially organized an inspection team to return to the country to investigate. The team of nine people, including Lin Hongxing, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and will visit major national product factories in the city. The following is a record of the situation:

Returning to the Country for Inspection

Due to the fact that our national product overseas markets have been overwhelmed by foreign goods in recent years, almost to the point of extinction, the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Ancestral Country Industry Inspection Team was specially organized to develop them, including Lin Hongxing, Xie Yutang, Liang Yongchang from Bangkok, and Liao Zhenwei from Wangjiao, a total of nine people, set out for China in January of this year and arrived in Shanghai yesterday.

Visiting Factories

After the inspection team arrived in Shanghai, they went to the Shanghai National Products Factories Association, the Machine-Made National Products Factories Association, and other groups to visit the responsible persons and requested to be introduced to visit national product factories. Those that have been scheduled include the Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, the Central Printing and Dyeing Factory, the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, and the Rongfeng Yarn Factory. Once the inspection is completed, they will take the road through Hong Kong to various places to continue the inspection.

### Yesterday Was Friendship Day Huang Jingwan Holds Tea Party Exchanges Views with Borderland Comrades; Sets Up Tibetan Language Institute to Cultivate Talent

Yesterday was the sixth Chinese Friendship Day. Young men and women friends from all walks of life in Shanghai all held gatherings to commemorate it. All the major and minor newspapers in the city had timely articles, encouraging further friendship. Initiator Mr. Huang Jingwan, in addition to going to various large, medium, and small schools to solicit donations for the Benevolence Medal, also held a tea party at the Shanjingyuan on Fuzhou Road at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, inviting comrades enthusiastic about borderland development, including Chen Heqin, head of the Chinese Education Office, Lu Xirong, president of New China University, Li Chucen (Gansu) of Fudan University, Bai Yunsheng (Qinghai) of Guanghua University, Dr. Ge Shaolong, Rongzeng Kanbu of the Bodhi Society, Luo Sangyixi, president of the Tibetan Language Institute, Zhang Fengzi, a veteran of the New Zhang Revolution, and Liu Buqing of Shaanxi. They exchanged five paths of friendship, doing their best in their respective positions, and promoted the basic principles of friendship: "Sincerity, righteousness, frugality, loyalty, trust, compassion, love, diligence, propriety, truth," setting an example for the people to promote the justice of friendship, and described the history of the founder of socializing and the meaning of the Three-Three Friendship Day, unanimously sympathizing and initiating the establishment of borderland education, first setting up a Tibetan Language Institute to cultivate practical talents for the borderland, preparing for the development of the borderland and the consolidation of national defense, and recommending Luo Sangyixi as the president of the institute, responsible for carrying it out.

### Shanghai-Taiwan Route Approved to Resume Navigation Although Jiaojiang Is Blockaded, Navigation is Still Possible; Registration Begins on March 1st

Since the Japanese army attempted to land at Haimen in Zhejiang, the Shanghai-Taiwan route has been cut off and Jiaojiang has been blockaded. Now the Japanese warships outside the mouth of Jiaojiang have left, and order has been completely restored in Haimen. The Wintai Defense Commander allows the Shanghai-Taiwan route to resume navigation. Registration is restarted on March 1st. The following are the details of foreign ships sailing to Haimen:

Haimen Resumes Navigation; Registration Handled

After the Siam-Taiwan route was cut off, the foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Taiwan route, the German ships Hanna, Haiford, and Gordon, and the Portuguese ships Meili, Tangbei, and Shantai, were approved by the Wintai and Ningbo defense commands to divert to the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo routes. Therefore, the above-mentioned ships are all sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Wenzhou routes. Now that order has been restored in Haimen, the Wintai Defense Command, with the approval of the commander of the Tenth Army Group, allows foreign ships on the Shanghai-Taiwan route to resume navigation. The re-registration of ships sailing to Haimen was handled on March 1st. Once the registration and review are completed, a scheduled notice of resumption of navigation will be issued.

Jiaojiang Blockaded; Navigation Still Possible

Although Jiaojiang in Haimen has been completely blockaded by the Chinese garrison, a waterway must still be opened on the blockade line for ships to pass through. As for the other blockade line created by the Japanese warships in Jiaojiang, which used sailing ships to carry sand and stones for sinking, it has been destroyed by the Chinese garrison. As long as a pilot is sent, the ships can still navigate Jiaojiang, sail into the blockade line, and dock at the wharf. Therefore, the foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Taiwan route have all followed the order to re-request registration with the Wintai Defense Command. The registration method is the same as the one previously promulgated.

### Japanese Wounded Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai in Batches

Recently, the number of Japanese wounded soldiers transported from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to Shanghai has been extremely large. Every day, there are more than a dozen large trucks, each carrying about seventy to eighty wounded soldiers, driving along the Bund to the Nanshi and Fenglin Bridge areas. The wounded soldier hospitals are overcrowded. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area due to attacks by the Chinese army.

### Statistics on Vessels Arriving at and Departing from Various Customs in January England First, Japan Second, Totaling 2,380,000 Tons

### Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Huang Zhenpan, Arrives in Shanghai

Huang Zhenpan, a former judicial officer and former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the National Government, has come to Shanghai to join the Shanghai Bar Association as a member and practice law.  He had been approved for retirement due to his advanced age (already seventy), and has now resigned from his position. It is reported that the Bar Association has approved his membership, and yesterday, it submitted the record to various levels of courts for investigation and reference.

### Prospects for Far Eastern Finance During the Sino-Japanese War "Mid-Chapter" - Speech by the Chairman of the HSBC Annual Meeting

China's Finance Remains Stable

China's finances have been affected by the war, but the western provinces have reported good harvests, and remittances from overseas Chinese have increased, providing considerable assistance.  In short, we can say that the situation of China's finance and economy is partly due to good fortune, but largely due to skillful management, which has enabled it to be maintained properly.  We are very concerned and watching the evolution of China's customs administration.  Although the Chinese government has not recognized the so-called Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement established last May, this agreement has in fact provided effective assistance to the administrative body during a period that could have jeopardized the integrity of its administrative power, enabling it to safely overcome difficulties.  The Chinese government has its own important reasons for not putting this agreement into effect, but we do not consider it a cause for regret. Apart from other matters, ports under Japanese control are not remitting their share of foreign debt. Moreover, it is to be hoped that this method can be applied equally to other difficult problems of international relations. However, the remittance of foreign debt in 1938 was never delayed until January of this year, when the Chinese government declared that 80% of customs duties did not belong to it, and could no longer bear the full responsibility for monthly foreign debt remittances of £400,000.  However, a clear declaration of debt default was avoided.  The future of customs debt depends entirely on the outcome of the current war, but we are confident that the Chinese government will handle this matter well, as maintaining credit on this debt will greatly enhance its honor.

The End of the Sino-Japanese War is Uncertain

One noteworthy event is that, despite such difficult circumstances, it was able to centralize its administrative power in the hands of Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, and overcome the difficulties. Maze has held this position for ten years, which deserves congratulations. Although all regions are in a state of war, Sir Frederick Maze, together with his staff, has been able to manage well under particularly difficult circumstances. The continued maintenance of the international character of the customs, and the maintenance of fairness to merchants of all countries, is of unprecedented importance.  I just said that we hope that the same approach as the customs agreement can be applied to other difficult issues of international relations, and I say this with the salt administration and railways in mind.  When the "Reorganization Loan" was established, the Salt Gabelle was organized. It was hoped at the time that this new organization, like the customs, would be helped by foreign staff to ensure its tax revenue independence and to guarantee that the loans would not be disrupted by local interference or other circumstances.  In the past, this goal has been largely achieved, but the Chinese government has gradually reorganized it, gradually reducing the number of Western staff, and thus failing to achieve the neutrality we had hoped for. The revenue from this salt tax is extremely important to China and is a potential guarantee. If confidence is placed in the administrative body, it will be of great value to China's future recovery.  The situation with the railways is bound to deteriorate as the war continues.  The Peiping-Mukden Railway is the only Chinese railway that has been able to maintain a positive state. The future of other railways in which British interests have a share is difficult to predict. These railways have suffered serious damage, and the damage will continue as long as the war continues. However, observing today's war situation, there is still no sign of an end.

Chinese Goods Exports Shift to South China

As for the Chinese railway authorities, they were fortunate enough to move a large portion of the rolling stock to a safe location before retreating westward, while automatically blowing up most of the bridges and tracks. As a result, the Japanese had to transport a large number of rolling stock from Japan, and the cost of repairing the tracks and bridges was also considerable.  Recently, there has been much discussion about the construction of highways and railways directly from inland China to Burma. The completion of the former (referring to the highway) is a great engineering feat, and its practical importance should not be overstated. The construction of the "Yunnan-Burma Railway" is still in its early stages, and it is difficult to predict the extent of its future progress at this stage. The Customs' 1938 trade report proves that the trade situation this year was far worse than before, but in terms of export figures, it is also sufficient to prove that the Chinese government has gradually and successfully changed the center of goods exports from the Yangtze River to the ports of South China. Therefore, although the total export volume of Shanghai has decreased, the export volume of various places in South China has increased greatly. If Guangzhou and other South China ports had not been congested in mid-October, this difference of one increase and one decrease would have been even more obvious. The import and export of Tianjin were slightly better than in 1937, mainly due to the huge increase in trade with Japan. From 1938 to September, the import and export trade of Guangzhou and Hankou, although obstructed by air raids and other restrictions, was still unimpeded. Now, only a very small number of foreigners remain in each of these places, struggling in harsh environments. The issue of re-allowing foreign ships to navigate the Pearl River is, of course, of great importance to the prosperity of Guangzhou and Hankou, and also has a great impact on Hong Kong and Shanghai. People of all countries are extremely concerned about this issue.

Cargo Transportation Does Not Stop

Last year, China's trade and industry were generally disrupted and hit hard, so temporary responses were needed everywhere to adapt to the needs of the environment. I dare to tell you, for example, that Japan occupied Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Xiamen, and Guangzhou this year, and went up the Yangtze River, past Hankou to Yuezhou. Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Shantou, and other southern ports have been repeatedly blockaded due to various relationships. As a matter of fact, of the treaty ports along the coast, only Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao have not been blockaded or affected by naval operations. This is what I dare to say is not wrong. All of this is sufficient to prove the misfortunes suffered by merchants, and in fact, not only that. Even the treaty ports that continue to be open and allow ships to come and go are often restricted by various temporary regulations. What is even worse is the various tax rates levied in the interior, and the freight rates have increased greatly due to the danger and difficulty of transportation. However, the export and import of goods can still continue uninterrupted. The biggest reason for this has to be attributed to the dynamism and perseverance of Chinese farmers and merchants, who have been able to find ways to transport goods in difficult situations. The government has only occasionally lent them a helping hand. The export volume of some important export goods even exceeded the usual years. Taking cotton as an example, 107,968,000 pounds were shipped to Japan this year, while in 1937, it was only 26,208,000 pounds. This is the most prominent example. In western China, the Chinese authorities are stepping up development, improving agricultural products, and promoting important products that can be exported in large quantities. The future results will be very promising.

### Bar Association: Recompilation of Member Directory

The Shanghai Bar Association has successively admitted more than 1,300 lawyers as members. Later, in order to facilitate the courts and members to check the offices or residences of the members and the telephone numbers, it was decided to reprint the member directory. All members have been notified and requested to quickly report their addresses, offices, and telephone numbers to the association for registration, so that they can be included in the new member directory. It is expected to be printed and distributed to all members by the end of this month.

### YMCA is Preparing to Establish a Children's Savings Bank

The Shanghai Chinese Christian YMCA Boys' Department is now preparing to establish a Children's Savings Bank, which is scheduled to open on the 8th of this month. Participating depositors can open an account with one dime, and afterwards, they can save five cents each time to cultivate children's savings habits and promote frugality.

### After the Sealing of Rainbow Temple Alley, Foil Industry Calls for Flexibility, Requests Removal of Wire Mesh and Installation of Movable Doors

The Foil Industry Association, based on the joint names of Lu Shenhe, Yuanhe, and Zhenhe Shen, three foil shops of its members located at Zhili Road (i.e. Rainbow Temple Alley) on Nanjing Road, stated that since February 25th, the entrance of Rainbow Temple Street and Nanjing Road was sealed by the Public Works Department, and the retail business was completely stopped, resulting in considerable losses. It earnestly requests the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to convey the situation to the Public Works Department on its behalf, to be considerate of the merchants' difficulties, to deal with the situation flexibly, to give way, so that customers can enter and exit, or to restore the original state as soon as possible, or to immediately modify the wire mesh at the entrance of Zhili Road and Nanjing Road and install movable doors, so that the sealing can still be implemented in case of emergency.

### Agreement Reached Between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy on the Implementation of Measures for Collecting Gold and Silver, Silver Shops are Not Allowed to Discuss Market Prices Privately, Gold Producing Areas Should Have Personnel Sent by the Office to Purchase

After the National Government controlled gold and silver, it organized a Gold and Silver Procurement Committee to collect a large amount to enrich reserves. The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, and the gold and silver collection offices of the four banks have consulted and decided to implement the following collection measures: (1) The gold and silver collection offices should order the various collecting firms to telegraph the local gold price once every ten days, and list them to be forwarded to the Ministry for consultation and to urge the collection; (2) The silver shops in various places should abide by the method of setting the gold price by the Central Bank, and announce the market price. They should not discuss the market price privately by the industry. In places where the Central Bank does not have branches, it should be jointly determined by the Bank of China, or the Bank of Communications, or the Farmers Bank of China. In places where there are no branches of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, or the Farmers Bank of China, the silver shops should follow the market price announced by the four banks and the silver shops in nearby places where the four banks are located as the standard, and private price negotiation is still not allowed; (3) The Ministry should be responsible for setting up gold and silver collection offices, and entrust silver shops in various places to collect gold on its behalf. In addition to the handling fee that should be given in accordance with the method of exchanging legal tender for gold, the silver shops should also be given a handling fee according to the amount as an incentive (for example, if 50 taels of pure gold are collected, the person who exchanged it should be given a handling fee of 5%, and the silver shop should be given another 5% as a handling fee for the silver shop to exchange on its behalf, for a total of 10%); (4) Personnel should be selected from the gold and silver collection offices and sent to various gold producing areas to determine a reasonable value and purchase it. The above measures have been communicated to the Joint Office of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China for handling.

The position of head nurse will be taken over by Miss De Lai, who has recently returned to the hospital after leave. Mr. Bao Lai has now joined the hospital as acting director of affairs. This is to perform Mr. Ha Meng's duties during Mr. Ha Meng's long leave.

### The Pseudo "District Public Office" Stops Paying Salaries and is Negligent in their Duties, All of them are Extremely Embarrassed

After the pseudo "Mayor Chuan Xiao'an" took office last year, in order to expand his territory, he planned to incorporate the nine counties in the near suburbs of Shanghai, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan, Chongming, Taicang, Jiading, and Qingpu into his jurisdiction, together with the five places in the urban area, namely Pudong South District, Pudong North District, Nanshi, Huxi, and Zhabei, dividing them into fourteen districts, each district setting up a pseudo "District Public Office," and assigning his henchmen as pseudo "Directors." This caused a fierce dispute with the pseudo Jiangsu "Provincial Office," so Chuan's attempt failed to proceed smoothly. As a result, only the eight pseudo "Political Affairs Offices" in the four suburbs during the former pseudo Superintendent's Office were reorganized into pseudo "District Public Offices." The eight pseudo puppet "Directors" were still succeeded by the former pseudo political affairs directors, namely Zhu Yuzhen, pseudo "District Public Office Director" of Pudong South District, Zhu Rui (i.e. Zhu Yunshan's alias) of Pudong North District, Shen Shijing of Nanshi, Li Zidong of Huxi, Zhang Pinquan of Zhabei, Yan Gangru of Baoshan, Lu Tieying of Chuansha, and Mei Liyang of Nanhui. Each person was supplied with a pseudo "salary" of 360 yuan per month, and the pseudo "section chiefs" in each pseudo "office" received 130 yuan per month, and the pseudo "section members" received 100 yuan. Together with the expenses of each pseudo "office," the pseudo "municipal government" had to bear 25,000 yuan per month. Unexpectedly, out of the blue, on the 1st of this month, Chuan Xiao'an suddenly issued a pseudo "order" citing the emptiness of the pseudo treasury, leaving "positions" and stopping "salaries." The eight small puppets were extremely shocked and went to Jiangwan together to demand that Zhi Xiao'an withdraw the pseudo "order," but to no avail. Because their income was cut off, all of them were extremely embarrassed. Now each pseudo "office" has completely stopped handling pseudo "duties." Within a week, a reorganization will be carried out.

### Order from the Executive Yuan: Commending Ke Ganshen, His Children are Allowed to Study for Free According to the Example of the Children of Anti-Japanese War Heroes

Ke Ganshen, Chairman of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, went to Chongqing two years ago after the National Army withdrew westward to plan the relocation of factories to the inland. He later died of overwork in Chongqing. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce requested commendation. The Executive Yuan replied with telegram Yu Zi No. 10187, stating that Ke Ganshen had been specially ordered by the Executive Yuan to be commended. The children he left behind were allowed to enroll in school, and the Ministry of Education was ordered to consider reducing or exempting tuition fees. According to the Ministry's reply, when the children left behind by Ke Ganshen are admitted to public schools at all levels in various places, they should be approved for free tuition in accordance with the regulations on free schooling for children of anti-Japanese war heroes.

### Pretending to be a Servant of Kong's Residence, Gathering a Crowd to Assault People and Resisting Arrest, Destroying Candy Stalls and Beating Patrolmen, a Large Number of Patrolmen Rushed to the Scene and Arrested and Detained them for Interrogation

Shen Wenqing, a native of Huzhou, who lives at No. 20, Lane 450, Fuli Road, is 25 years old this year. He recently lost his job due to the war and makes a living as a hawker. He sets up a stall outside every day to sell candy and also sets up children's gambling. At 12 noon on the 2nd of this month, Shen set up a stall at the intersection of Avenue Petain and Route Tenant in the French Concession to do business. Unexpectedly, a car driver, Bao Ziyun (20 years old), from Pudong, pretending to be a servant of Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, came to Shen's stall, put a five-yuan banknote on the stall to gamble, and Shen refused. Unexpectedly, he angered Bao, and gathered Cai Chengxiang (26 years old), Cai Chenglong (22 years old, the two are brothers living at No. 369 Avenue Petain), Li Yongliang (18 years old, living at No. 273 Avenue Petain) and other four people, beat Shen, kicked over the stall, and scattered the candy all over the ground. Shen was no match for them and went home injured. He told his sister, Xu Shen (35 years old), and reported to Foch Road Police Station. The head of the police station sent Detective Lu Luxian and Shen to investigate. Shen pointed out Bao and Cai Chengxiang, and Detective Lu arrested them and planned to take them back to the police station. Unexpectedly, Cai Chenglong and Li Yongliang gathered more than ten people to come, resisted arrest and assaulted people, beat Detective Lu, and planned to rob Bao and Cai Chengxiang. They also tried to drag Detective Lu to Kong's Shanghai residence to make trouble for him. Fortunately, patrolman No. 897 heard the alarm and came to help arrest them. However, because the number of people was too different, it was difficult to match Bao and others. At 4 pm, it happened that more than ten patrolmen on duty passed by and rushed to help. Only then did they arrest Bao, the two Cais, and Li and other four people and detain them in the police station. At 3 pm yesterday, the defendants were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, and Judge Liao Yuan interrogated them. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer of the French Concession administrative authorities, said that the police station still needs to investigate the case of the defendants' assault and resistance to arrest and obstruction of official duties, and requested a change of date for further interrogation. Then, Detective Lu Luxian and the plaintiff Shen Wenqing successively stated the process of being beaten and resisting arrest. After the court verified the words and briefly interrogated the defendants, they were ordered to be detained pending further investigation. The defendants were detained.

### Jiaxing Pseudo Section Chief Was Sniped, Pseudo Education Section Chief Shen Suping Was Seriously Injured, Terrorist Case Has Entered the Mainland

Pseudo Education Section Chief Shen Suping Was Seriously Injured After a series of assassinations occurred in Shanghai, the Japanese side protested to the Public Works Department because of this. Not long ago, in the mainland controlled by the Japanese side, a case of a traitor being sniped and seriously injured also occurred. According to a person from that place yesterday, it is recorded as follows: Shen Suping, 54 years old, the pseudo county public office's third section education section chief of Jiaxing County, took a train from Jiaxing back to Shan on the 2nd (the day before yesterday) at 0:30 pm. After getting off the train station, he changed to a rickshaw. Unexpectedly, a strong man about 30 years old, wearing black clothes, suddenly saw Shen looking around proudly in the car only a few steps away from the station. He immediately blocked the way, pulled out a handgun, and opened fire on Shen. One bullet hit Shen's left hip, and fresh blood flowed straight out. He fell to the ground from the car in pain. The strong man saw that his goal had been achieved and ran quickly towards the station and disappeared. Immediately after that, the Japanese puppet military police arrived and sent Shen by car to the city to be treated by pseudo county government forensic doctor Sun Da'e. It was heard that Shen was old, so his injuries were extremely dangerous. According to the person who came, Shen, at the age when he was about to die, acted arrogantly and abused his power after taking up his pseudo position and abused private individuals. His nephew, Hu Binyao, is currently working as a translator and is also rampant for a time. His wife's name is Shen Jinghua, who is 51 years old.

### Italian Soldier Stabs a Milk Worker, a Rickshaw Collided with a Military Unit and Was Stabbed by an Italian Soldier

The English "Great American Evening Post" reported that Tang Hesheng (transliteration), 24 years old, an employee of a certain milk company at No. 92 Avenue Road, was riding a rickshaw past the factory of the Qi Electric Company on Robertson Road at 11:40 am today (the 3rd) when he accidentally collided with an Italian Marine patrol. Unexpectedly, a certain soldier in the unit stabbed him in the chest with a bayonet, causing Tang to suffer serious injuries. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Punishing Soil Traffickers, the Main Criminal Zhou Anbu is at Large

Liu Zhaonian, Li Shugui, Zhao Baosheng and other Chinese detectives of the Narcotics Department of the Public Concession Police found out that someone was privately setting up a soil trafficking agency in Taozhu Lane No. 15, No. 483 Jiujiang Road. They reported to the First Special District Court and obtained a search warrant. They rushed to search the place at 7:15 am on the morning before yesterday and arrested Zhou Junluo (also known as Zhou Chuchen), a native of Chaozhou. They seized 20 and a half taels of Indian opium soil with the brand name of He Feng Foreign Company, 450 yuan in legal tender, a passbook of the Bank of China with 105 yuan and 6 jiao, and a passbook of the Shanghai Bank with 100 yuan. He confessed that the opium soil belonged to Zhou Anbu (also known as Zhou Yufeng), a native of Chaozhou, who entrusted him to sell it on his behalf, and he could make a profit of 5 jiao per tael. Zhou is a famous soil trafficker. The soil seized in the previous cases by the department was supplied by Zhou Anbu. The court had previously ordered a strict arrest of him, but he has not been able to obtain him to this day. Zhou Junluo was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated the process and filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 5 of the Opium Prohibition Regulations. In addition to requesting that the defendant be severely punished, he also requested that the confiscated money be confiscated. When Zhou Junluo was questioned, he admitted that he had sold opium soil on behalf of Zhou Anbu. Judge Xiao Xieyi questioned him and immediately sentenced Zhou Junluo to one year and six months in prison. The confiscated opium soil, banknotes, etc. were confiscated according to the list.

### Fires Repeatedly Occur at Wayside Wharf, Causing Heavy Losses to the Japanese, Countless Losses of Military Food and Merchandise, the Japanese are Paying Close Attention to the Bizarre Fires

A fire occurred at the No. 8 warehouse of Wayside Wharf in Hongkou at 10 pm on February 27th. The details have been recorded in the previous report. However, the extent of the losses was not detailed because it was impossible to find out. Yesterday, the newspaper received a war report, which stated that there had been many fires in the warehouse before, but they were not leaked out because they were discovered very early. The goods stacked inside were mostly Japanese military food and smuggled goods. After the fire broke out that night, the watchmen of the warehouse were panic-stricken and urgently requested assistance from the Fire Brigade of the Concession. The Central Fire Brigade drove to the scene to spray water and put out the fire after half an hour of firefighting. It is reported that the goods burned included 5,000 boxes of rayon, 3,000 bags of dried fish, 5-600 large boxes of matches, 4,000 pieces of flour and leather materials, more than 300 pieces of cotton textiles, more than 800 boxes of toys, and about 600 boxes of silk fabrics. In addition, there were about 7,000 pieces of smuggled goods that were not burned, but were also stained with water. Therefore, the losses were huge. Afterwards, the Japanese side paid close attention to the cause of the fire and sent a large number of pseudo-officials to sort it out. The surrounding defenses have also become stricter than before.

### Lawsuit Between Teacher and Student over Taking Over a Pharmacy, Case is Complex, Detailed Investigation and Further Interrogation Needed

Lin Xiuhao, a Fujianese who studied in France and is now a professor of medicine at a certain university, is 31 years old this year. He previously intended to take over the "Modern Pharmacy" at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Paul Beau in the French Concession, which was run by a French old lady named Ies Duto Beiliye (transliteration). The agreed price was 60,000 national currency. Lin was concerned about the regulations of the French Bureau of Public Works, which stipulated that doctors could not open pharmacies, so he entrusted Jiang Heng, a fellow villager and pharmacist who graduated from the Sino-French Medical University and lived at 11 Rue Lupan, Paris New Village, to represent him in taking over the business. He first paid 20,000 yuan of the price and signed a contract for taking over the store, which stipulated that the remaining 40,000 yuan would be paid within a specified period. If the price could not be paid in full by the deadline, the store would be returned to the original owner for management. Later, Lin failed to pay the money by the deadline, and the seller urged Jiang Heng, the representative who took over the business, to fulfill the contract. Jiang had no choice but to return the store to the original owner. Later, Lin claimed that Jiang had returned the store without his consent, so he hired lawyer Ai Zhenlin to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Jiang Heng of breach of trust. Jiang also hired lawyer Zhu Gaorong to defend him. The case was repeatedly heard by Judge Zhang Minsheng without a conclusion. Yesterday afternoon, the court held another hearing. Both parties and their lawyers were present. After questioning the two parties, the court found that the case was complex and required further investigation, so it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned.

### Police Conduct Large-Scale Search of Oriental Hotel, 130 People Involved, Lasted a Long Time but Nothing Was Found

The "North China Daily News" reported that the Shanghai Municipal Police continued to combat armed crime and terrorism. Last night (2nd) at 9 pm, in cooperation with the White Russian commercial group, they suddenly searched the old Oriental Hotel at the corner of Zhejiang Road and Hankou Road. The search lasted 25 minutes, but nothing was found. 130 people participated in the search. After the search, they left at 9:30 pm. Although the authorities claimed that this was a routine search, the time, location, and details of the buildings to be searched were kept secret in advance to prevent criminals hiding in the hotel from escaping. At 9 o'clock, two red security vehicles carrying 50 reserve police officers arrived at the scene. 50 members of the White Russian commercial group had already set up a cordon around the hotel. Five teams of detectives, each with five Chinese and one foreigner, were also waiting on the scene. Cooperating with the reserve police officers, they began to search the hotel. The travelers in each room were carefully inspected, and all other people encountered in the hotel were also body searched. Although it was raining, many Chinese gathered in the nearby streets, some thinking that another terrorist attack had occurred. The hotel seems to have been a hiding place for criminals for many months. It is still remembered that on the 15th of last month, two detectives saw three thugs, believed to be related to the armed robbery of 30,000 yuan from a coal shop on Xinza Road a few days ago. As they were about to arrest them, they were attacked and injured by the three thugs. The thugs then managed to escape, but were finally arrested a few days ago. On the 25th of last month, they were sent to court for interrogation and are still in custody pending detailed investigation. Last night's search team also carefully inspected vehicles in the vicinity, but did not find any incriminating items or be able to arrest or detain anyone. This was the third major search conducted by the Shanghai Municipal Police since the 23rd of last month. The fact that the previous two searches did not result in any arrests seems to indicate that the criminals have moved to other safer places. The significant reduction in armed robberies and terrorist attacks in recent days confirms this. It is not yet known whether the Shanghai Municipal Police will continue to conduct searches in the near future, but it is possible. At the same time, the erection of barbed wire and a large-scale blockade in the area bordering the Concession is nearing completion, in the hope that this will prevent any undesirable elements from entering the Concession from outside.

### Dancing Girl Attempts Suicide by Poisoning, Life in Danger

A local woman named Wang Meimei, about 20 years old, was a dancing girl at the Shanghai Ballroom at the corner of Guangdong Road and Fuzhou Road. Recently, for some unknown reason, she suddenly became disillusioned with life. Yesterday afternoon around 4 pm, she went alone to the Yongle Inn on Guangdong Road and booked room number 19, paying the room fee in advance and writing the name "Miss Zhang" on the guest registration form. She then closed the door. At 5:30 pm, a tea servant at the inn heard moaning sounds coming from room number 19. He knocked on the door but received no answer. He forced the door open and saw Wang Meimei lying on the bed, pale and unconscious. An empty bottle of poisonous liquid was found on the table, indicating that she had taken poison. He immediately reported to the police, who sent an ambulance to take Wang to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, because she had ingested a large amount of poison, it was impossible to find out the reason for the poisoning. Her life is also in great danger. It is said that two books of "Strange Heroes" and a pawn ticket were found in Wang's pocket.

### Wang Zhengting Discusses Wartime Work of the Red Cross Society, Hopes for a More Sound Achievement in the Organization and Cooperation of the Society

The General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society held a plenary meeting of directors and supervisors in Hong Kong at 3 pm on February 25 to report on work and discuss association affairs. The attendees included Chairman and Vice-Chairmen, Directors and Supervisors Wang Zhengting, Du Yuesheng, Liu Hongsheng, Yan Huiqing, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Ye Gongchuo, Liu Ruiheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Song Hanzhang, Tang Shoumin, Yao Yuqin, Yang Zhixiong, Xu Shiying, Zhu Qinglan (represented by Li Jin), Wen Lanting (represented by Yan Huiqing), Zhu Hengbi (represented by Lin Kanghou), Tang Feifan (represented by Liu Ruiheng), Mu Ouchu (represented by Pang Jingzhou), and Shen Lianfang (represented by Wang Xiaolai), totaling 15 attendees and 7 representatives, making a total of 22 people. Chairman Wang Zhengting presided over the meeting, with Secretary-General Pang Jingzhou, Secretaries Gu Lanxin and Gao Renou recording. After the formalities, the chairman delivered an opening speech, stating: "Ladies and gentlemen, today we are holding a meeting of directors and supervisors. I would like to express my sincere welcome to all of you who have come from afar to attend the meeting. During this time of war, many of our staff members have served the Society in very dangerous situations. On behalf of all the directors and supervisors, I would like to express our admiration to them. The purpose of the Red Cross Society is to provide relief, especially during wartime, to rescue injured soldiers and civilians. For any organization, the most important thing is its own soundness. If the organization is not sound, the work will naturally be scattered. Today, after attending the meeting, I have some thoughts and would like to discuss three principles with the assembly. First, organization. Since its establishment, the Society has never experienced such a major war, so all preparations and organization have not been perfect. Second, connection. In the past, the Society's work has not been thoroughly connected, so some units working outside have been duplicated, and some have been lacking. This is due to insufficient connection efforts. Third, cooperation. The importance of cooperation is even greater than organization and connection. If work cannot be done cooperatively, it is unsound. China has always lacked these three forces. If we want to make the Society sound, we must pay attention to these three points. Foreigners also criticize us for the lack of these three points. If we can pay attention to these three points, then we will be effective if we follow the rules. As for this meeting, I have three points to mention. First, our Society does not have good connections with the Red Cross Societies of other countries. There are inevitable gaps and frictions in the work. From the Society's standpoint, we should find ways to cooperate with other organizations, especially with relevant government agencies, to achieve a synergistic effect. I recently went to Chongqing and was deeply saddened to see that the Society does not have an office in the important capital. The relief work of the Society relies on donations; otherwise, even a skilled woman cannot cook without rice, and the work will inevitably be affected. Speaking of fundraising, I feel that the Society lacks publicity work. Most of the people in the Society hold the principle of 'just doing our own thing, no need to tell others.' However, for the sake of fundraising, it is necessary for the people of the country to understand the work of the Society. I have seen that overseas Chinese are very enthusiastic. Even if they do not know how the donations are handled, they still donate continuously. If the overseas Chinese understand the full picture of our work, the donations will certainly increase. Third, the publication of accounts. I believe that the accounts of the Society are very clear. After auditing, they are also reviewed. However, the accounts of the Society have never been published. We should publish them once a month, stating the amount of income and the distribution of expenses, so that the people of the whole country, the overseas Chinese, and foreigners will know, which will be of great help to our fundraising efforts. Today, I hope that everyone can carefully review the shortcomings in past work and find ways to remedy and improve them. In the future, it is more appropriate to issue orders from one place, so as to achieve the effect of fingers and arms. I am truly pleased and welcome all of you who have come from afar. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks."

### Three Robbers Chop and Kill Gatekeeper, Snatch Pistol, Each Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Remaining Gang Members Sentenced to Heavy Prison Terms

Jiang Youcai, a man from Shandong who was over 50 years old and served as a gatekeeper at the Zhenlun Silk Factory at 1350 Route Mayen, had a 32-caliber Colt pistol issued by the Bureau of Public Works, with five bullets in it. The bandits, taking advantage of his old age, wanted to snatch his pistol. On the morning of February 13th of this year, at about 5 o'clock, Jiang, a Chinese constable, was going from his home to the factory to work when he was near the intersection of Seymour Road and Route Mayen. He was suddenly attacked by a number of thugs who rushed up from behind, pulled out sharp axes, chopped him down, snatched his pistol, and fled without a trace. Jiang Youcai suffered a serious head injury and was taken to Renji Hospital, where he died after ineffective treatment. Subsequently, Feng Baishun, the head of the Chinese Detective Department of the Putuo Road Police Station, and detectives Zhang Ankang and Yuan Xinzhong, arrested the murderers Zhang Qifu, Zhang Minghua, and Dai Er, all from Yangzhou, at the Yang Yuxing Church restaurant at 4348 Robert Dollar Road. They seized the original stolen pistol and five bullets, and took them to the police station, where they were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Zhang Qifu, Zhang Minghua, and Dai Er to life imprisonment for the crime of joint robbery and intentional homicide, and confiscated the two axes.

### Robbery of Cattle Dealers, Gang of Thieves Punished

They seized one hand grenade and one pistol and took them to the police station. It was found that these people were related to the armed robbery of 200 yuan from Zhang Fuji's home at 221 Liaoyang Road on February 10th of this year. The police station prosecuted them for robbery and illegal possession of firearms and explosives. The First Special District Court has completed the interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen ascended the Second Criminal Court and announced the sentences. Song Haigen, Yang Linsheng, Peng Zhenfu, Peng Jicheng, and Yang Genquan were sentenced to six years of imprisonment each for armed robbery of residences at night.

### The National Rejuvenation Alliance Concludes Solicitation of Spring Festival Donations

The Chinese National Rejuvenation Alliance is composed of enthusiastic patriots. Since its establishment, it has developed rapidly and made more contributions to the country and the nation. During the Lunar New Year, the Alliance, in view of the general public's adherence to old habits and extravagance, launched a Spring Festival donation campaign, hoping to dedicate unnecessary consumption to the country. The intention was good. Once it was initiated, it received enthusiastic support from all walks of life. Therefore, within ten days, more than 400 yuan of national currency was raised. In addition to material gains, it also gave the spirit of the Shanghai compatriots a great influence. The Alliance has now ended the Spring Festival and the donations will not be made at one time, so the procedures will be temporarily concluded and efforts will be made to continue to persuade compatriots to contribute money and effort to jointly relieve the national crisis.

### Cigarette Shop Manager Ye Qirong Accused of Illegal Detention, Occupying Store Premises and Falsely Accusing to the Japanese Military Police, Ye's Lawsuit Against Zhang Guanlan for Breach of Trust is on Appeal

The Dachangcheng Cigarette Shop at 452 Pingliang Road, East Shanghai, is operated by a partnership of the woman Liu Chenshi, Zhang Guanlan, Liu Peiyuan, and Yu Banqin. Zhang serves as the manager. After the outbreak of the war, the area fell into the war zone, so they moved to Yongping Lane on Guizhou Road. Liu entrusted Ye Qirong, her relative (the manager of Yu Qingfeng Cigarette Shop on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession), to investigate the accounts. Ye learned that Zhang had

embezzled cigarettes and put the profits into his own pocket. She sued Zhang for breach of trust in the First Special District Court. During the hearing, Zhang blamed Qiu Jiankang for the responsibility, which resulted in an acquittal. It is now on appeal. Recently, Dachangcheng partners Qiu Rongfu, Lv Zhiqiong, and Qiu Xuanmao suddenly filed a criminal lawsuit against Ye Qirong and Liu Chenshi in the First Special District Court for illegal detention, claiming that the defendants had attempted to occupy

the Dachangcheng shop on the 28th of last month and falsely accused them to the Japanese military police, which led to the three plaintiffs being detained by the Japanese army. Although they were released after being found to be innocent, they had suffered greatly. Therefore, they filed a lawsuit. The case has been summoned by the First Special District Court once. The defendants Ye Qirong and Liu Chenshi also hired lawyer Sun Zuji to file a defense, stating that after the Dachangcheng shop moved to Yongping Lane on Guizhou Road after the war, Zhang Guanlan, the shareholder and manager, saw that Liu Chenshi

was a woman and could be deceived, so he embezzled cigarettes to enrich his own pockets. The plaintiffs were originally employees of Dachangcheng. Zhang Guanlan colluded with them to move most of the store's assets to 497 Pingliang Road after our army's westward retreat and opened another cigarette shop. At the same time, he sent a letter stating that the Dachangcheng shop was located in Liu Chenshi's house and was responsible for keeping

all of the assets safe. He also claimed that after the situation was settled, he would have to ask Liu Chenshi for 8,000 yuan for the assets. Later, Liu found out about the embezzlement and sued Zhang in the Special Court. Although he was acquitted, it is now in the process of gathering evidence for an appeal. Because the investigation of the accounts was done by Ye, who was entrusted by Liu, Zhang transferred his anger to Ye. Liu, because the plaintiffs had moved the Dachangcheng assets without authorization, went to the plaintiffs' place on February 2 to check the assets, intending to

issue a receipt to clarify responsibility. This led to a dispute. The plaintiffs relied on their numbers and twisted Liu, who was old and weak, to the Japanese military police. After questioning, both parties were released. Now, they falsely accuse Liu of leading Japanese ruffians and military police to beat them. Liu is an elderly widow who does not have any contact with outsiders, let alone foreigners. Ye Qirong was ill at the time and had no pass to go to Hongkou. Therefore, the accusations

were all untrue and requested that they be acquitted. The case was heard again in the Third Criminal Court by Judge Jiang Shuzi yesterday. Because the cases involved by both parties are still in progress, and the Zhang Guanlan's breach of trust case is also on appeal, it is necessary to clarify the facts, so the court announced that the hearing would be adjourned for further review.

### Japanese Soldiers Robbed and Stabbed to Death Puppet Tax Collector

Zhang Zhongxian, a puppet tax collector of the Minhang Puppet Autonomous Association, and Dai, another puppet staff member, went to Beiqiao Town the day before yesterday afternoon to collect monthly donation fees from various shops, totaling more than 600 yuan.

Zhang argued slightly, which angered the Japanese soldiers, who stabbed him repeatedly with bayonets. Zhang was stabbed more than ten times and fell to the ground and died. Later, Dai reported to the Minhang Japanese Army Headquarters, and together they went to Beiqiao and identified the two Japanese soldiers who committed the crime. They were taken back to Minhang for questioning.

###翁同龢之孫 毆傷情婦罰鍰 不服判决上訴遭駁回

The grandson of Weng Tonghe, the deceased Prime Minister of the Qing Dynasty, Weng Zhenfu (45 years old, residing at No. 724 Avenue Road and No. 59 Rue Tenant de la Tour in Shanghai), had a long-term romantic relationship with Gu Caiqin (29 years old), the wife of Zhao Shijia (his maternal uncle's wife, i.e., the wife of his concubine Zhao's younger brother).  This relationship ended when their hometown fell and Zhenfu's family sought refuge in Shanghai, separating them. Unexpectedly, in November of last year, Gu came to Shanghai to visit Weng and demanded alimony.  Weng refused. On the 30th of that month, around 10 AM, Weng left his residence on Avenue Road.  He was suddenly stopped by Gu at Rue Cardinal Mercier, who grabbed him and refused to let go, demanding living expenses.  Weng, being a man of high social standing, was embarrassed to be entangled by a woman on the street and laughed at by passersby. He resorted to using his fists and feet against Gu.  After this incident, Gu, deeply affected, went to the International Hotel on Avenue Road that evening, secluded herself in a room, wrote a suicide note, and then ingested opium to commit suicide for love. Fortunately, a porter discovered her in time, and she was rushed to the hospital and resuscitated.  Doctors confirmed that Gu had several bruises from punches and kicks on her body.  The police summoned Weng for investigation and prosecuted him for assault.  After a trial at the Special Court No. 1, Weng Zhenfu was found guilty of causing bodily harm and fined 300 yuan, with the option of serving one day of labor for every three yuan.  Weng appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, dissatisfied with the judgment.  Presiding Judge Yu concluded the investigation and awaited sentencing. It has now been learned that Judge Yu ruled on the case yesterday, with the main verdict being: The appeal is dismissed.

### 上海敎育界改革敎育意見 關於國語科改革諸問題（一）

Shanghai Educational Community's Views on Education Reform Issues Regarding the Reform of the Chinese Language Subject (1)

— Yang Jinhao

I once wrote an article entitled "Problems with Elementary School Chinese Language Teaching Materials During Wartime," which was published in the Education Magazine. Now I want to discuss the various issues concerning the reform of the Chinese language subject in general.

I. The Position of the Chinese Language Subject

(1) The scope of Chinese language teaching materials is very broad. In addition to providing language skills such as reading, appreciation, writing, and expression for training scholars, it also has many influences on scholars, such as enriching their thoughts, developing their rationality, cultivating their character, and influencing their behavior.

(2) The Chinese language subject has the most class hours in middle and primary schools, and teachers have the opportunity to contact students almost every day. Furthermore, assignments such as compositions, notes, and weekly journals are expressing students' feelings, opinions, and lives. Therefore, Chinese language teachers have the most profound and thorough understanding and knowledge of students, and their responsibility for guidance is also the greatest.

Therefore, if the Chinese language subject's teaching material selection, teaching methods, and extracurricular guidance can all be appropriate, it will truly become the most basic course for cultivating scholars into outstanding citizens of the new China.

II. Selection of Teaching Materials

(1) Future Chinese language teaching materials should include more articles that are rich in realism. This will not only help students understand and practice in reality, but it is also the spiritual food that students urgently need, so they are particularly interested and happy to accept and make progress. The past cyclical peddling of old goods and the academic rote learning must be thoroughly reformed. However, this does not mean that the selection of materials can only be limited to new articles. Many relatively permanent masterpieces, or ancient articles that are related to and coordinated with the new reality, should naturally also be considered for selection. However, famous articles and correct theories about the new reality must be given increased weight.

(2) Famous articles that have been definitively evaluated and writings about famous people and events should be selected as much as possible because they still have value today, and many have even become popular sayings. It is truly appropriate to have students read and understand them thoroughly. Some Chinese language textbooks, in order to avoid being vulgar, often abandon these materials and replace them with many obscure articles, which results in beginners losing the good opportunity to understand the common language knowledge circulating in society. This is a major flaw. For example, "Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger" from the Book of Rites, "The snipe and the clam fight" and "Adding feet to a snake" from the Liezi, have all become common idioms. In order to enable students to thoroughly understand their allusions and content, it is truly necessary to teach them. Furthermore, such as Tao Qian's "Peach Blossom Spring," people still quote it today, and it is also an extremely good prose piece, so it should also be selected for teaching. However, when teaching it, the ideological background should be analyzed and criticized. It is best to follow it with Professor Pan Shu's "General Critique of the Pessimistic Thought School" to provide a dual contrast in consciousness. As for the many modern people who mention Yue Fei, Qin Hui, Shi Kefa, Wu Sangui, etc., then such as Yue Fei's "Man Jiang Hong," the Song History "Biography of Yue Fei," Dorgon's "Letter to Shi Kefa, Minister of the Ming Dynasty," Shi Kefa's "Reply to Dorgon's Letter," Lu Jueyun's "Biography of Yuan Yuan," Wu Weiye's "Yuan Yuan Song," etc., can all be selected for teaching. As for the biographies and speeches of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang Kai-shek, the incidents and battles of January 28th and August 13th, either taking ready-made materials or inviting experts to write them specifically, should all be selected as teaching materials.

(3) The depth and complexity of Chinese language teaching materials should be based on three criteria: writing style, intention, and humor. The distribution of Chinese language teaching materials in each grade should naturally take into account these three standards. Generally speaking, in terms of writing style, classical Chinese is deeper than vernacular Chinese; in terms of intention, argumentative essays are deeper than narrative and descriptive essays; in terms of humor, descriptive essays are deeper than argumentative and narrative essays. However, due to the complexity and differences in the above three conditions, it cannot be generalized. Therefore, the distribution standards set by the Ministry of Education for Chinese language teaching materials in each grade should not be regarded as dead formulas but should be used flexibly. For example, they stipulate that the proportion of argumentative essays in Chinese language teaching materials for lower grades should be extremely small. In fact, argumentative essays that are rich in realism and have a simple writing style are also very popular and easy to understand for students in lower grades. During this period of the Anti-Japanese War, they are hoping to read more about anti-Japanese theories, so why must we rigidly adhere to the standards and only include two or three argumentative essays in Chinese language in lower grades? On the other hand, some beautiful articles that do not have a plot and only emphasize description are not interesting to them and they are unable to appreciate them. Therefore, Chuandonghua's inclusion of many beautiful articles and no arguments in the first volume of "Reviving Chinese Language" for junior high school seems to show a lack of understanding of the students' mental abilities and level. Furthermore, the high school Chinese language teaching materials uniformly adopted by the schools in Guangxi Province are all ancient articles, presumably in order to raise the level, but this is actually a formalistic view. Because many vernacular articles with complex structures, profound intentions, and profound styles are also very advanced. The students there are enthusiastically demanding to read more new articles that are rich in realism, and writing in vernacular is the modern trend. If ancient articles are taught year after year, it will not only make students feel bored and difficult to benefit, but it will also cause many drawbacks in their thinking and writing. Therefore, if the selection of materials in the future is to be commensurate with the level of students, it must take into account the writing style, intention, and humor, as well as the form and content of the articles, and the relationship between each article and reality. (To be continued)

The current semester began on January 9th. President Xu returned to Shanghai on the 10th after completing public affairs in Hong Kong and held a school affairs meeting to promote school affairs. Students held a welcome ceremony yesterday. President Xu said in his speech: "Modern education has reached a time of transition. The need for practical science is becoming increasingly important. Our school was established for this purpose to meet the needs of the environment. Although our school is in its initial stages, it is very gratifying that our colleagues are working together so diligently. The bright future of our school can be foreseen."

Nanyang Tutoring School: The Nanyang Tutoring School, run by Wu Hueshi at No. 302 Rue Amiral Bayle, has a large number of students enrolling. Among the various subjects, the National Medicine Specialty and the Calligraphy and Painting and Sculpture Department are the most developed. The head of the Medical Department, Xie Liheng, is a leading figure in traditional Chinese medicine, and his deputy, Zhang Zanchen, is also Xie's top student. His mastery of surgery and his deep cultivation of medicine have long been admired by all sectors. Furthermore, the head of the Calligraphy and Painting and Sculpture Department, Cai Xian (號震淵), is proficient in landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, grass, insects, animals, antiques, and is particularly skilled in portraiture. Those who obtain even a small piece of his work treasure it as if it were a precious jade. He has taught Chinese painting at the Suzhou Art College for more than ten years. The deputy head, Lin Jiehou, is one of the four major bamboo carvers in the country. He is currently in charge of the Calligraphy and Painting and Sculpture Department with Cai Xian. Therefore, the number of applicants is very large, it is said.

### Lu Zhongen and Cai Yanxiong Penalized and Sent Off, Paramount Suffered Setback Yesterday, Result: 48 to 40, Maihong Wins West Qing Basketball Championship

In the West Qing Basketball League, the match between the two powerhouses, Paramount and Mai Linghong, took place at 9 PM last night in the association's basketball hall. Both teams had been consistently victorious since the start of the competition. This match was Maihong's last, and a win would secure them the championship. Although Paramount still had three makeup games, overcoming this hurdle would put them on a clear path to the title, making this game akin to a championship final. The audience last night numbered nearly a thousand, filling the West Qing hall to capacity. After the initial contact, Paramount took an early lead of 9 to 2. The score then became 9-9, and then 11-11, and then 13-13, tying three times. Paramount then took a six-point lead at 19 to 13, but Maihong scored eight consecutive points. The first half ended with Paramount trailing by two points, 19 to 21. Early in the second half, Cai Yanxiong was penalized and sent off. Maihong continued to take the lead. Paramount worked hard on offense, eventually tying the score at 32. Then the score was tied at 35. Zhongen was then penalized and sent off, drastically changing the situation. Ultimately, Maihong won with a score of 48 to 40, triumphantly securing the championship. Paramount fell short, which is deeply regrettable.

Evenly Matched, Momentum Shifts Constantly. Referees: Qu Honglv and Bolang. Paramount fielded Chen, Zhou, Cai, and Lu, while Maihong countered with Mu, Pai, Wang, Sa, and Bo. After the initial contact, the two sides were evenly matched. Maihong employed a five-man defense, and Paramount repeatedly failed to score. Then Bolien committed a foul. Xianglong made a free throw, opening the scoring. Zhongen and Yanxiong followed with successful shots, giving Paramount a 5 to 0 lead. Maihong immediately called a timeout to break their momentum. Bolien broke through the defense and scored, and Xianglong and Dayun quickly responded. Then Cai and Lu committed fouls in succession. Bolien made two free throws, narrowing the score to 6 to 9. Paramount called a timeout, but Permann scored three consecutive points, tying the score at 9. Dayun and Muer each scored a basket, making it 11-11. Muer and Xianglong each scored again, making it 13-13. The intensity of the competition was evident. After the opponent called a timeout, Paramount scored three consecutive times. However, Maihong suddenly scored eight points, ending the first half with Maihong leading 21 to 19.

Key Players Sent Off, Momentum Lost. After switching sides, Yanxiong scored the first basket. Bolien quickly scored two points. Yanxiong was ejected after committing his fourth foul. Xilin entered the game. Wang Erde missed a free throw. Xianglong and Zhongen were also penalized. Fortunately, Bolien and Wang Erde did not score. Bo probed the basket rim from afar, and the ball went in, drawing applause. Seeing that the situation was not good, Paramount called a timeout and replaced Xianglong with Xu Wenkui. Wenkui was flustered on the court and was caught off guard by Bo, who stole a point. Xilin scored, and Muer broke through the defense. At this time, Bo made both a free throw and a field goal. Paramount also added eight points, tying the score at 32. The two sides were still locked in a fierce battle. After the score reached 35-35, Bo scored again. With five minutes remaining, Zhongen was sent off, and the momentum shifted. Jia Youliang entered the game and scored a basket after the opponent scored two. After this, Paramount made significant substitutions, but to no avail. Instead, Maihong's momentum soared. Soon, the final buzzer sounded. As a result, Paramount suffered a crushing defeat to Maihong with a score of 40 to 48. Maihong won all their games and secured the championship.

### Venue Problems, This Year's West Union Football Can't Be Finished, Yiyuan Racecourse Will Soon Be Closed, A Total of More Than Forty Matches Waiting to Be Made Up

This year's West Union Football League has been repeatedly delayed by rain for four weeks, with as many as forty-five matches waiting to be made up. The Yiyuan and Racecourse stadiums will be closed starting Monday, the 20th of this month. Only Jiaozhou Park will be available until the end of this month. Therefore, whether it is the league or the cup, this season will not be able to be completed and will have to be stopped halfway. According to the association's secretary, Mr. Spiker, the decision has been made to complete the cup matches as soon as possible. The Skoto Cup, International Cup, Zilin Cup, and Junior Cup only have the finals left. The league matches in each division are also entering their final stages. However, the First Division matches, which are played in a double round-robin format, are the most difficult to resolve. The Skoto Cup final between Lido and West Police will be played next week. The International Cup final between Portugal and Scotland will be held the following week (i.e., the 18th or 19th). If it rains again, the Zilin Cup or Junior Cup will also not be able to be completed.

### The Trumpet

— Yang Jinhao

Literature and art are trumpets. We must pick them up and sound the call to encourage and guide the war of resistance!

To regard literature and art as the gramophone of politics is to misunderstand the essence and efficacy of literature and art! Literature and art do indeed have a political nature, and they do indeed remain behind politics, assisting the progress of political struggles; but the political consciousness in them is by no means rigidly assembled into the works by the writer, but is naturally revealed through the writer's sensibility and with the help of realistic images. The works written by writers who have seen clearly the inevitable laws of historical development, look forward to a bright future, and strive for progress, are even one step ahead of politics, guiding the progress of political struggles in the form of vanguards.

Grasp the trumpet of literature and art, use it to blow the march, and even use it to blow the charge!

It is correct to think that literature and art are mirrors reflecting reality. But this mirror is not just a plane mirror that can only reflect the superficial surface of reality, nor is it a concave-convex mirror that bizarrely distorts the true appearance of reality; but it is a microscope that magnifies things that are too small to see clearly, an X-ray mirror that exposes the essence covered by a cloth, and a telescope that presents the future dynamics to the eyes. What is reflected in the mirror is not the phenomenon of the static reality of the epidermis, but the condition of the dynamic reality of the essence. Moreover, this mirror is not cold and dead, but it contains the activity of life and the cry of the soul! A moving trumpet call is spreading the reader's thoughts, stimulating the reader's emotions, and encouraging and guiding the reader to rush to the struggle of reforming and renewing reality!

Works that write out personal occasional feelings are also allowed, and works that write out established events are needed; but we want to ask writers to utter less private groans, narrate less trivial experiences, and write more works that experience the collective common feeling and illuminate the road of realistic development, so that the role of literature and art can be further advanced and become the vanguard standing at the forefront of political struggles, blowing the horn of the vanguard and leading the ranks of the struggle!

The anti-war writers in this war of resistance and nation-building should expand the sensitivity left over from the past into a sharp awareness of the war of resistance and nation-building, so that every word of the great epic they depict will become a trumpet call, using the trumpet of literature and art to reveal the various dynamics that people do not pay much attention to but actually exist, to predict the various scenes that people have not yet seen from afar but will inevitably arrive in the future, and to educate the public to unanimously rise up and carry out the reforms that have not been reformed and the promotions that have not been carried out—so that our decisive war of resistance and nation-building will be accelerated and thoroughly achieve the final victory.

Do not take the trumpet of literature and art and blow the sound of decadence and sorrow. Writers, please run forward, stand up straight, and raise it: "Fight, fight, fight..." Blow the march and the charge of the war of resistance and nation-building!

### The Whistle of the Steamship in the Rainy Night

— Yue Bin

Rain silk fluttered down; there was no moon, no stars in the high sky, and the entire river was dark and silent. The steamer was rushing forward, its engine sound faintly breaking through this deathly silence. The water smelled fishy.

Chen Yi looked at the four steamers behind him, also rushing towards Chenmu Town; and then at the boundless dark sky, and felt an abnormal urgency in his heart. Beside him sat Lu Ping, his head down – he was thinking.

The ship was full of munitions and ammunition; small steel cannons and machine guns were installed along the ship's edges; and soldiers were fully armed on the deck behind the rudder room. More than a dozen successive guerilla raids had made them unusually frightened and angry. They sat quietly in the cabin, pacing, the lights on the ship dim.

"What should we do?" Chen Yi squatted down, looked at Lu Ping's oily face, and asked softly.

"……" Lu Ping was still pondering with his head down.

Chen Yi looked at the river again: broad and calm.

"What should we do?" he asked Lu Ping again: "It's probably only eight li away."

"Hmm, eight li," Lu Ping replied calmly – and then pondered again.

The rain silk was still fluttering down. The five steamers were rushing forward more rapidly, the sound of the bows cutting through the water and the sound of the engines were louder, the entire river, without a single light, was as silent as death.

"Are there devils inside and outside the whistle room?" Lu Ping suddenly asked.

Chen Yi stretched his head and peeked into the whistle room, then shrunk back and said softly,

"Door……"

Lu Ping hurriedly pushed him, and Chen Yi hurriedly stopped his mouth – three soldiers were pacing past with heavy steps.

Watching them go far away, he continued:

"There are two devils outside the door, I don't know about inside."

Lu Ping frowned and pondered again.

The five steamers were still rushing towards Chenmu Town, the raindrops became larger, and the night seemed even heavier.

"Only five li left!" Chen Yi's face flushed red, and he was even more anxious, "Why are you always silent?"

"Are there sentries in the town?" His voice was so light, "Can sentries see in this kind of rainy night!" His voice was urgent: "Judging from the situation, the people in the town are probably still dreaming!"

Lu Ping stood up and looked at the river in the rainy night, black and turbid, with a particularly strong fishy smell, the embankment looked like it was sinking into the water in the raindrops.

"What can you do?" Chen Yi sat impatiently, then stood up again, and said anxiously, "Only two or three li left!"

Lu Ping was uncomfortable from the noise of the engines, but he had decided everything, he put his mouth to Chen Yi's ear: "... Rush in and pull the whistle, I'll help you..."

"Don't hesitate, it's worth sacrificing yourself to save thousands and tens of thousands of compatriots." Lu Ping looked at Chen Yi's hesitant attitude and said encouragingly.

"No, it's not the problem of 'death'; for the country, for the family, I should do it, but we have to be careful – is the whistle room unguarded?" Passionate, sincere, his face even redder.

"Hurry up. The people inside will never expect that move of yours." His voice was very resolute, still so soft.

The rain silk fluttered down, the steamers were rushing forward more rapidly, only one and a half li away from Baitangtan in Chenmu Town.

"Okay! Let's do it!"

Chen Yi rushed towards the whistle room, a soldier ran to stop him, this handyman, but suddenly cried out sharply and fell down.

"Bang!……Bang!……Bang!……"

Gunshots rang out, shouts, footsteps, all mixed into one.

The ship slowed down. In the dark corner, Lu Ping did not know where he got a rifle, calmly and bravely shooting at the enemy in front.

"Woo!……Woo!……Woo!……"

"Woo!……Woo!……Woo!……"

Suddenly, the whistle rang out loudly.

Lu Ping knew that he had completed the task, and he showed his last smile, carrying his body full of gun marks, with the gun with no bullets, and jumped into the river.

On the Baitangtan side, a group of figures were swaying – they had heard the loud whistle in their sleep and ran to defend.

"Boom!……Boom!……Boom!……"

The five steamers fired blank shots and rushed back, - the entire "raid" plot was shattered. Waves flew, dragging long... Gradually two corpses floated on the river.

The steamers could no longer be seen, and Baitangtan was still gathering countless figures swaying.

The rainy night was turbulent. A gust of dawn wind blew, and dawn arrived.

### Spring Bamboo Shoots Sprout in the Rain, Each Contending for Supremacy

### "Great Victory in the Lanzhou Air Battle"

— Guo Nidi

Popular Ballad

The weather was clear on the 23rd, with ten thousand miles of clear sky and no clouds. Famous mountains and rivers are not mentioned, only Lanzhou City is described. Lanzhou is located in Gansu, and it is known throughout the world as a hub of transportation. It was noon at twelve o'clock on that day, and the streets were crowded with people. Suddenly, the bell of the air raid siren rang, and we knew that the annoying enemy planes were coming. Shops closed their doors calmly, and timid citizens temporarily hid in air raid shelters. In a moment, the sound of the plane engines was faintly heard, and the planes could be seen in the distance, arranged in columns in the shape of the Chinese character "人," flying in formation with great vigor. Like a flock of geese in autumn, like dragonflies skimming over the water. If you count them with your fingers, there are twenty planes, not even half a point off. Our air force had already been on alert. No sooner said than done, they ascended into the clouds to wait. Sitting in the planes were brave pilots with loyal hearts. Not waiting for the enemy planes to get close, they rushed forward like lightning. In an instant, the machine guns fired in bursts, like firecrackers on New Year's Eve. They soared and dived with extraordinary skill, their imposing manner unmatched. A fierce battle began, shaking the heavens and moving the earth. The enemy planes panicked when they saw that we were prepared, and their formation immediately collapsed. They had to defend themselves in a flustered manner, unable to escape our encirclement. Dark clouds filled the sky, and the wind howled, the sun was dim, and the universe was dark. Suddenly, there was a loud explosion that shook the mountains, and an enemy plane caught fire and exploded, the black smoke obscured everything; from the clouds, it somersaulted straight down to the lower world, tumbling and rolling, like a kite with a broken string, burying the dreams of the cherry blossom girl in her boudoir. When our planes saw this, they were filled with courage and charged forward without mercy. The enemy planes were lacking in morale and courage, and they scattered in all directions, thinking of escaping. In a moment, there were two more explosions like thunder, and two more enemy planes suffered the same fate and turned to ashes. The situation suddenly changed again; the enemy planes increased their speed and fled with all their might. Our planes bravely pursued, and the pilots were all smiling. One after another, enemy planes were hit, and they crashed ten li east of the city. This time, the enemy planes lost a total of nine planes, and the world's newspapers were buzzing. Gentlemen, listen to my conclusion, this is called "Great Victory in the Lanzhou Air Battle."

### Mr. Cao Juren (Continued)

— Wu Zijin

Three. The Essayist

Let's first quote a passage from Mr. Cao's self-narration:

"I believe there is no such thing as a 'writing for the sake of writing' article in this world. Bai Juyi said: 'Articles should be written for the times, and poems should be composed for events.' At least my writing is always for a purpose... In the great tide, I will also float on the waves like a bubble; one after another, I have written nearly a million words of essays. I will never underestimate myself, and I will never shirk a bit of laziness in promoting the progress of the times." (Essays and Reflections: As mentioned above.)

Romain Rolland said, "There is only one kind of courage in the world, and that is to face reality as it is – and love it." Mr. Cao, who never shirked a bit of laziness, stood firmly in reality, pushing the wheels of the times forward, always maintaining a strong spirit, unyielding and indomitable. This can be seen everywhere in his essays, in his gestures of raising his arms and shouting. "My essays," he said, "have fulfilled their duty to write for the times." This is not an exaggeration at all.

He used his pen to lash himself and to lash the unreasonable society.

What he practiced was the doctrine of effort. His view of life was that life is a battle—an endless battle. He most disdained those who evaded, feared, and dared not face life head-on—the optimists and escapists. He admonished:

"...All kinds of ways to anesthetize oneself and avoid... can only be like an ostrich, burying its head in the forest, thinking that it has already hidden itself, letting the hunter catch it and slaughter it." (On the Life of Leisurely Scholars in the Wei and Jin Dynasties)

Four. The Old Warrior

In 1847, Gogol wrote a letter to Zhukovsky saying:

"Writer, you must first cultivate yourself like a person and like a compatriot on your own land, and then you can pick up the pen; otherwise, everything will end in failure."

We do not need writers of the Rostrelev type—empty talkers with grandiose words. In the great era, writers should cultivate themselves more diligently.

Mr. Cao's consistent life has been one of steadfast progress. He is one of the writers who knows how to cultivate himself the most. When the war of "August 13th" began, he resolutely took off his blue bamboo cloth gown, gave up his comfortable life as a university professor, joined the army with his pen, braved bullets and rain, and galloped east, west, north, and south.

Two or three years ago, he issued the argument that "a scholar is useless," which was criticized at the time. In fact, I see that although Mr. Cao sighed the same breath as Huang Zhongze, the two people's views are absolutely different. Huang Zhongze was poor and destitute all his life, and he was full of complaints. All he had was the sigh of a declining scholar-bureaucrat class. What about Mr. Cao? I am afraid that he himself felt that in this great era, a weak scholar was very ashamed, empty talk on paper was of no practical help, and the power he came up with was so weak and insignificant, so he angrily said, "What a useless thing a scholar is!"

He hoped that he could be tempered stronger and more powerful in the furnace of reality.

Now, Mr. Cao is moving forward more and more bravely. I sincerely wish the "blue bamboo cloth gown" professor well, and wish the "military uniform" old warrior well.

Novella

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

The invitation arrived at One-Eyed Li's place, and One-Eyed Li was greatly surprised. He never expected that he would not dare to provoke Regiment Commander Ye, but Regiment Commander Ye would pay attention to him instead. He was originally a person with courage but without strategy. Immediately, he hurriedly held the invitation and came to find Xiao Mazi to discuss countermeasures.

When Xiao Mazi saw that his name was also on the invitation, he couldn't help but feel a burst of joy in his heart, but this joy did not last long. With a turn of his eyes, he immediately changed his mind. He sneered and said:

"Those who come are not kind, and those who are kind do not come. They will never invite us for no reason. There must be another purpose in this. Maybe it's just like Xiang Yu's Hongmen Banquet. We have to be prepared."

"Then what should we do? Should we not go?" One-Eyed Li was a little anxious, and his one eye was opened especially wide.

"We can't not go either," Xiao Mazi puffed out his chest and said, "We must not show weakness to them."

"Since their intentions are not good, then we should act according to the circumstances. If we run to their side again, wouldn't we be throwing ourselves into the trap?" One-Eyed Li said worriedly.

"What are you afraid of? They can plot, and we can plot too. As long as we are well prepared, even if it's a dragon's pool and a tiger's den, we may not be able to escape. Going is a must, but before we go, we must first prepare so that we can be foolproof and not be ambushed by them."

"Got it! Got it!" One-Eyed Li said with a sudden joy on his face, "I have a bulletproof steel vest that a former apprentice gave me. I haven't worn it for a long time. I'll wear it now, and I'm not afraid of what they will do to me."

"That's of course one thing to consider." Xiao Mazi nodded and said, "In addition to this, I think before we go, we should first send a few brothers, disguised as villagers, to Hepu Town to inquire about the news. On that day, we will go together, bring more brothers for protection, and then tell the disguised people to hide their weapons in the outside to respond. If something happens, everyone will cooperate from the inside and outside, no matter how many people they have, it will not be difficult to break a bloody path."

"Good plan! Good plan! You truly deserve to be my strategist!" One-Eyed Li patted Xiao Mazi on the shoulder and raised his thumb. (24)

### Commercial News: Financial Northern Gang Independently Purchases, Cash Inflation Rises Again

Yesterday, the black market situation of cash (Haxia) in this city was surprisingly inflationary, and the comeback was due to the limited supply of chips. Wan Yu and a certain money exchange company acted as agents for the Northern Gang to independently purchase, and although silver shops and two other money exchange companies and gold shops sold, they gradually increased prices severely, causing the price to break through the two barriers of 2,130 yuan to 40 yuan in succession, showing a trend of rising from a low level, and finally soaring to the 2,150 yuan mark, unexpectedly surging by 10 yuan. People's hearts in all directions turned firm again, but transactions were still not active, and jewelry gold also rose by 2 yuan, while customs gold and the like have turned down.

Haxia Rose Another 20 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) was not opened at first. It was not until after 10 o'clock that a certain money industry was seen to enter 50 taels of silver shops, with the opening price of 1,133 yuan, which was 4 yuan higher than the previous closing price. After the opening, a certain broker acted as an agent for northern speculators to purchase in large quantities, and at that time, sellers were quite rare, and continued to advance to higher peaks. A certain broker entered 50 taels of silver shops, priced at 35 yuan, and then entered 50 taels of silver shops for 36 yuan, and then entered 50 taels of money exchange shops for 37 yuan. Later, he entered 50 taels of cash shops and silver shops respectively, all for 39 yuan. It was already 11:30 at that time. After that, the market situation turned quiet, and the price also remained stagnant. Until noon, no opening was seen, so the noon closing price was still 39 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the news that the potential of foreign exchange was tightening, people's hearts became more prosperous. In addition, northern speculators entrusted a certain money exchange company to vigorously absorb, and the supply of sellers was even rarer, and the upward trend intensified. First, a certain money exchange company entered 50 taels of silver shops, priced at 45 yuan, and soon entered 50 taels of the same industry, jumping to 50 yuan. Finally, another 50 taels of the same industry were entered, with the evening closing price of 2,149 yuan, which resulted in a net increase of 20 yuan compared with the previous day (17 yuan difference throughout the day). The current selling price of the current Yu number is 2,160 yuan, and the purchase price is 2,145 yuan. The current bidding price is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there is no opening in both cases.

Jewelry Gold Listed at 2 Yuan Higher

At the beginning, the exchange price of silver jewelry in silver shops was not changed, but at noon, due to the strong potential of Haxia, Si Yue Lao Fengxiang issued a notice to list 1 yuan higher. At 3:45 in the afternoon, because Haxia continued to rise, it was listed 1 yuan higher again. Datongxing changed to suspend 218 yuan, Xintongxing 216 yuan, and collected 220 yuan.

British Pure Gold Returned Downstream

London electricity on the 2nd, British pure gold returned downstream, shrinking by one and a half pence per ounce, and still reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, three and a half pence, causing the central bank's Chinese cash purchase price to also drop to 1,310 yuan and six cents, and the listed customs gold also dropped by two li, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 2 li, and the Shanghai standard bidding price also dropped by 1 yuan, totaling 1,205 yuan, 9 jiao.

### British and American Gold Pounds, Competing to Purchase, Fearing It's Too Late

Yesterday, British pure gold fell by one pence, British and American exchange rates fell by 125, foreign exchange firms settled very eagerly, and banks' willingness to sell was not refreshing. The market price was once weak. Later, due to the throwing of plug from Hong Kong electricity, the positions were abundant, and the market price turned stable. Without distinguishing between glory and disgrace, Haxia opened firmly and rose, and the Tianjin gang came to search again. Gold shops and money exchange companies followed to collect, and the gold price rose sharply. Transactions were very active throughout the day, and the closing was firm and high. Because the price of gold rose, the demand for British and American gold pounds was strong again, speculation was excited, and the market price rose sharply. The demand for British and American gold notes was also strong, and the competition to purchase was feared to be too late. Most market prices rose, and a few were not changed due to the stability of the exchange rate. Door-to-door transactions were very active, and the association's transactions were also prosperous. Yongfeng issued Changtai's American gold notes for 500 yuan, Zhenxing issued Changtai's American gold notes for 300 yuan, Chengtai issued Changtai's American gold notes for 300 yuan, Yongbian issued Zhenxing's German gold Cai for 300 yuan, Baocheng issued Yongfeng's Hong Kong notes for 500 yuan, Yongsheng issued Yongfeng's Hong Kong notes for 1,000 yuan, Changtai issued Xintai's British gold pounds for 20, Chengtai issued Huitong's Hong Kong notes for 1,000 yuan. Yesterday's market price, British and American gold pounds each rose by 5 jiao, British gold notes rose by 8 fen, American gold notes rose by 1 fen and 3 li, Hong Kong notes rose by 3 li, French franc notes fell by 5 hao, Singapore notes, Annam notes, and German gold notes each rose by 1 fen, Australian gold notes rose by 2 jiao, and other currencies were not changed.

### Foreign Exchange Demand Recovered Strongly, Relying on HSBC to Maintain a Balance

Yesterday's exchange market was busy with settlements from major foreign firms. Foreign banks were also actively acquiring on behalf of foreign merchants' banks in Tianjin. In addition, foreign banks in this city (except HSBC) were reluctant to sell but keen to buy, resulting in tight potential. The British gold rate once fell to 8 pence, 1.09375, and previous deposits were also soft at 15 yuan, 8.125. However, due to HSBC's strong support, the situation returned to normal. As a result, British and American exchange rates remained unchanged, but transactions were smooth. Although foreign firms also aggressively absorbed Hong Kong exchange rates, foreign banks supplied actively, so the situation remained stable.

In the early morning, the London large strip was recently extended by 0.0625, and the forward was unchanged. The New York silver price was still unchanged. London raw gold shrank by one and a half pence. The exchange rate of British to American fell by 6 hao, and there was no change to French and Shanghai. American to British fell by 125, and there was also no rise or fall to French and Shanghai. The central government's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The banks' opening selling price in the morning was British exchange rate 8 pence 125, and American exchange rate 15 yuan 875, which were both flat compared to the previous closing. After the opening, various foreign banks suddenly came to aggressively acquire, but fortunately, the Bank of England (HSBC) was willing to supply only a limited amount, resulting in little change in the situation. Yuli Datong's bank absorbed HSBC's British gold at 8 pence 125, and American exchange rate at 15 yuan 875. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was announced to be 2.5 li higher, totaling a slight 7.75 percent. After that, major foreign firms also came to acquire, but at that time, foreign banks other than HSBC were quite reluctant to supply, resulting in a slight softening of the American exchange rate. Foreign firms pulled and settled HSBC's British gold at 8 pence 125, and then settled and purchased its American exchange rate at 15 yuan 8.4375. Later, a certain foreign firm also absorbed the Dutch Hong Kong exchange rate at 54 yuan 375, and the situation was quite stable. By the time of the noon closing, the Bank of England (HSBC)'s selling price was the same as in the morning.

In the afternoon, major foreign firms came to aggressively acquire again, and foreign banks were quite reluctant to supply, resulting in a tight potential. Foreign firms settled and purchased the foreign bank's British gold for only 8 pence 1.09375, and purchased and settled a certain bank's American exchange rate for only 15 yuan 8.125. Finally, a foreign firm also absorbed the foreign bank's Anda Hong Kong exchange rate for 54 yuan 375, so the situation gradually stabilized. The evening closing HSBC selling price was British gold 8 pence 125, and American exchange rate 15 yuan 875. However, other foreign banks were quite reluctant to supply the above evening closing prices. As a result, the British and American exchange rates remained unchanged compared to the previous closing, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also remained unchanged.

### Large Strips are Recently Extended and Distant Levels

London electricity on the 2nd, India bought in, some people covered their shorts, and the market was stable. After the close, it was still flat. A few bought at the listed price. The large strip silver recently returned to a length of 0.0625, and the forward remained unchanged. The New York silver electricity, the American silver price remained unchanged as before. Also, Bombay silver electricity, the Indian silver market situation was stable and quiet, and the spot and near and distant periods were unchanged.

The Discount Rose Sharply by More Than 3 Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange clearing bills rose again. Because the exchange suddenly raised it to 40 yuan, the market also broke through the 40 yuan mark, and each thousand yuan was still hovering around 37 yuan and a half. When I heard that the exchange price had been raised, the suppliers waited and watched, and the price gradually rose to 40 yuan and 7 and a half angles. At noon, it was 40 yuan and 5 angles. In the afternoon, it once rose to a high price of 41 yuan, and the final price was 40 yuan and 5 angles, which was a sharp increase of 3 yuan and 2 and a half angles compared with the previous day.

### Securities and Bond Markets in Dual Competition

In the securities black market, the market situation yesterday was still very fierce in the dual competition, and the trend was that the multi-party had an absolute advantage, and the transactions were extremely enthusiastic. The strength of the buyers was becoming more and more sufficient. Because the red ticket interest coupon could be discounted by 95%, the purchasing power was greatly increased. According to financial circles, it is estimated that more than half of the unified government bonds are in Shanghai. This should definitely be the 30 million yuan scale of the red ticket interest coupon. In fact, the sudden increase in its strength and the advantage of the multi-party in the market all have their origins. The problem of the Russo-Japanese fishing industry is gradually becoming more acute, and the British attitude is also becoming clearer. The environmental advantage has become a trend, which is enough to increase the interest of the multi-party. Yesterday's market competition situation was that the continued selling of No. 10 was still making a final struggle, and the number of sales was 600,000 to 700,000. Because the sales exceeded the amount, more than 100,000 were recovered on the spot, and the momentum has become the end of a strong crossbow. It can be seen that the number is now 5,000 yuan. The actual goods have already been imagined, and the enthusiasm of the buyers is even more so. The market price changes several times a day. Because No. 11 and No. 35 of the Northern Gang and retail investors are extremely eager, they take the opportunity to absorb, and finally form a situation of demand exceeding supply, and the trend is rising. After several days of competition, the shorts have already shrunk their hands, and the trend is gradually becoming prosperous. At the opening, No. 35 first bought in, followed by No. 11. Because Yuan Da tried his best to suppress it, the shorts were slightly superior at the time, and the market price returned to a small two or three angles. No. 35 bought in again, and No. 10 also turned from selling to buying, but No. 7 also sold, and Tongkang Yongkang and No. 49 came to buy again. The China Industrial Bank also had considerable needs, and the retail purchases in between were also huge. As a result of the competition, it was still slightly better by five fen, one angle, and a total of two angles. The trend has been unified, and the total number of transactions is estimated to be more than 1.1 million. A concise table is listed below:

In stock trading, 50 shares of the Chinese Business Securities Exchange were traded, and the price was 26 yuan and 6 jiao. Also, a large number of Great China Match stocks were traded, and the price was 12 yuan and 5 fen. It is said that there were more than 1,000 shares traded, but it is not known for sure.

The London Chinese foreign currency bonds were listed on the 2nd of this month (Thursday). The aftercare public bonds and other three types each rose by half a pound. The British-issued aftercare public bond ticket price was 49 pounds, the Felix aircraft ticket price was 14 pounds, and the Hukuang Railway public bond German-issued stamped bond ticket price was 20 pounds. The rest were unchanged. The London physical supply included 2,000 pounds of Sino-French American gold 5% public bonds (i.e., 10,000 US dollars), settled at 66 and a half pounds, half a pound higher than the market.

The London British Merchant Far East companies' stocks were listed on the 2nd of this month (Thursday). Bank stocks rose and fell with each other. The Jardine Matheson Bank stock continued to fall by 5 shillings, and the price was 9 pounds. The HSBC Bank London-registered stock continued to rise by one and a half pounds, and the price was 88 pounds. The Kailuan Coal Mine unregistered stock fell back by one penny, and the market price was still 17 shillings and 3 pence. The rest were unchanged.

### Two British Merchant Banks Will Pay Dividends: Butterfield & Swire and Wheelock Marden

The local British merchant Butterfield & Swire Ltd. has recently decided by the board of directors to pay the final dividend for the year 1938, with a total annual dividend of 5 yuan per share (each share with a face value of 10 taels of silver), which can be paid out after the current shareholders' meeting is held.

Also, the local British merchant Wheelock Marden Tug and Lighter Co. has also decided by the board of directors to pay the next installment of the preferred stock dividend for the year 1938 at a weekly interest rate of 3.5%, totaling an annual weekly interest rate of 7%, and the final dividend for ordinary shares at 24 yuan per share, totaling an annual dividend of 34 yuan (each share with a face value of 35 taels of silver), which can be paid out after it is submitted to the shareholders' meeting for approval.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean傾銷

In the Dalian soybean market, because the market price in that port rose frequently and the old head ticket also rose, people's hearts were shaken. In addition, the selling price of Chongming sand soybeans also rose, with a trend similar to that of Dalian soybeans, so the general appetite tended to Dalian soybeans. As a result, Nikko threw out more than 30 cars in total from the second half of March to the end of April, and the price rose from 8 yuan, 1 angle, 2 fen to 8 yuan, 1 angle, 5 fen at the close. The Nanyang gang of Chongming sand soybeans went to more than 600 bags, and the price was 8 yuan, 1 angle, 3 fen to 7 yuan, 9 angle, 8 fen, which was 5 or 6 fen higher than the previous day's market. It is found that the soybean exports include 380 bags shipped to Shantou, 230 bags shipped to Xiamen, 2,230 bags shipped to Hong Kong, and 400 bags of raw peanuts also loaded to Hong Kong.

### Sandao Market Fell Again, Wheat Bran Has a Downward Trend

Yesterday's wheat bran market had a downward trend under the influence of exchange rates and the news that the Sandao market fell by another 2 angles. However, the monopolists did not show significant letting go. Yesterday, only returned goods were opened, with 1,200 to 1,300 bags of Fuxin small bags of bran, priced at 4 yuan and 2 angles in cash. At the moment, the factory has no floating chips to release, which is actually restricted by the more than 100,000-bag throw-off goods. It is found that the wheat bran exports include 5,500 bags shipped to Xiamen.

### Grains: The Difficulty of Maintaining People's Food Has Been Revealed, and the Price Increase of Rice and Grain Cannot Be Suppressed After All. Glutinous Rice Has Reached 17 Yuan, and Japonica Rice is Also at 14 Yuan. The Time for New Rice is Not Far Away, but What Technique Can Be Used to Prevent Leaks?

The rising trend of glutinous rice is still strong, because the source of supply from the interior is scarce and does not meet the demand. Yesterday, it rose by another half yuan. Special goods have reached the 17 yuan mark. Thick and thin japonica rice is also not prosperous due to the lack of source of supply. There are still only four or five ships in Hexia, and three or four thousand bags of car transportation are coming. The authorities responsible for adjusting the people's food, although publicizing in the newspapers that there are sufficient rice stocks in the industry and that there is no need to worry, in the past two months, large ships and boats have often been seen at the wharves in Hongkou, loading goods and unloading rice and grains. Therefore, how can the source of food in Shanghai not be depleted? Now that the time for new rice is not far away, and the rice stocks in Shanghai are still sufficient, but since the New Year, the increase has reached one yuan. The future is long, and if this is not remedied, there will eventually be a day when it will be difficult to maintain food. Yesterday, the price of rice in Jiagutang had reached a high price of 14 yuan, and the rice market opened with Changbang Gaojing also knocking on the 14 yuan mark. Among them, the customs were particularly mixed, with increases ranging from two or three angles. Du Yangjian Zhujian has a slightly inferior way out, adding a few fen or an angle, but Yixing Yangjian also reached 13 yuan and 3 angles, and Zhujian was 12 yuan and 5 angles.

There are continuous shipments of foreign indica rice, and the market sentiment continues to rise. Transactions are particularly prosperous, and the top and bottom market opened with five or six thousand sentences, and the market price continued to rise by an angle. Nanjing Gao Xian rose to 11 yuan and 2 angles, Gao Wu Xian rose to 11 yuan and 8 angles, and the market plate was more adequate than usual. The bulk of the goods was more lively, and the middle decision was only handled by retail investors in this street. Wuhu Ke Yuan was short of Du Yuan, and the source of Ke Yuan could not be sustained either. Yesterday, the market rose 6 or 7 angles with Bian Yin, but Saigon foreign rice rose to 15 yuan and 2 angles for several days, and although the goods wanted to shout higher again, the transaction has loved silence.

### Flour's North Sales Are Difficult to Develop, and the Wheat Market Stalemate Is Even More Difficult to Break

The flour market had no characteristics yesterday. The sales of North and South gangs are no longer as lively as the transactions after the red market. The reason is that the North Ocean gang is full of local foreign flour, and the demand for Shanghai flour is only for matching purposes. It is difficult to develop large-scale sales. However, the Jin Zhi in the South Ocean gang is still active, but there is no whole batch transaction either. Buyers and sellers do not have much will. The total market only opened 34,500 bags of Jun Chuan brand flour. No. 2 flour is still 4 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, No. 3 flour is 4 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao, and No. 4 flour is 4 yuan and 2 jiao. Because the goods are scarce, there is no proper delivery, and the market is still brewing. Today, there are 3,500 bags of flour shipped to Yantai, 5,300 bags shipped to Tianjin, 3,000 bags shipped to Shantou, and 1,000 bags shipped to Xiamen.

The wheat market transactions are as bleak as ever, and the newly arrived goods are particularly rare. Most of them are directly delivered to the factory, and the price is of course slightly different. Each factory is not poor in taking raw materials, and can only handle the nature of the business, and is unwilling to let go of the price to absorb. The market stalemate is difficult to break for a while. After all day's holding, there was no proper delivery. It is heard that there are one or two hundred bags of goods sent to the factory, and the selling price is similar to the previous opening.

### North and South Goods: Red Qian Rose by 3 Yuan Again

Yesterday, another 15 bags of red Qian goods were opened, and the quality of the goods and the color and light were all outstanding, so it was raised by 3 yuan again, and the transaction was completed at 38 yuan. The market is very strong.

### Cotton Yarn, Domestic Fine Cloth: Sales Are Not Large, and There Are Wholesale Transactions of Coarse Cloth

Cotton yarn and white goods such as 11, 13, and 14-pound coarse cloth have continuous wholesale transactions. The factory's board price per piece rose by 1 jiao to 2 jiao. Although there are 20 to 30 brands of fine cloth and fine twill fabrics from the China Factory, the output is small. Recently, because the market price is far higher than that of East Piece, the coloring path has been sharply reduced, the current sales volume of the customer gang is slightly mixed, the market inventory is quite prosperous, and it is difficult to increase the selling price. However, Da Peng fine cloth, with a certain dyeing factory's determination to use domestic gray fabrics, exclusively purchased 200 packages, priced at 12 yuan and 8 jiao, the market price rose by 5 fen, the factory's board price was particularly high, and the colored goods were stable. The Sichuan and Yunnan gangs purchased colored satin, printed cloth, hemp yarn, poplin, etc., which was quite lively, but although there were many colors, the quantity was not large. The Sichuan gang handled 1,100 pieces, all packed in postal packages. The Yunnan gang was limited by the scarcity of boats and the tonnage of goods, and it was difficult to load the goods stored in Shanghai smoothly. Therefore, the intention to handle the goods was weak. The Wenzhou and Yongbo gangs handled fine cloth, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, foreign yarn, standard cloth, etc., with more than 200 pieces, and the loading and shipment have gradually become prosperous in recent days.

Yesterday, the white goods market in Dongbu slumped again, because the actual sales of the dyeing factory in this street have not yet been prosperous, and the purchase of Tianjin gangs is intermittent, so yesterday's transactions were still only 400 to 500 pieces in this street. The fine cloth of each brand fell by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half, and the fine twill was relatively strong, falling by 5 fen to 1 jiao. However, the same intentions were still high, and the Dongmian Foreign Bank continued to accept the opening of fine cloth and fine twill of each brand, totaling 1,000 pieces. The opening price of the 12-pound colored ball fine cloth was 12 yuan and 2 jiao and a half per piece, the leading 12 yuan and 2 jiao, the trumpet child 11 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, the leading fine twill 11 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, and the blue double fish fine twill 11 yuan and 4 jiao and a half.

Today's cotton yarn exports include 265 pieces shipped to Yantai, 285 pieces shipped to Shantou, 27 pieces shipped to Xiamen, and 95 pieces shipped to Hong Kong. The market is becoming more and more stable, and the trend is mild, and the customers are helping each other.

### Yarn Flower, Shantou Bombed, Cotton Yarn Actual Sales Show Further Decline

Yarn: Actual demand is relatively clear, but the northern merchants still require 10-count coarse yarn. Unfortunately, factories are shipping very little, and most have been completely snapped up. Therefore, market prices are increasingly tight because Japanese factories do not typically spin this type of coarse yarn. Thus, once business starts, purchases must be made from Chinese factories. As for fine yarn sales, they are not as strong as in recent days. Southern merchants are sluggish due to the Japanese bombing of Shantou, causing some concern among people. Actual sales have further declined. However, inter-trade transactions remain lively. Some are selling existing stock and diverting to warehouse receipts, so market prices have not changed much. However, 10-count coarse yarn and 32/40-count fine yarn situations are showing slight improvements.

Current yarn market opened this morning. Some discussions suggested that the bombing of southern Fujian might cause the market to decline. At the same time, sales to customers were slow. Fortunately, sellers were not eager, and opening prices were flat. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was priced at 400 yuan, not much different from the previous day. Then, a certain trader came and swept up a large quantity, causing it to rebound by 1 yuan to 401 yuan. Warehouse receipt price was 397 yuan. By the time the market closed, it was heard that actual transactions were not busy, and the market turned soft again. 20-count "Double Horse" closing price remained at 400 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 396.5 yuan. In the afternoon, Yunnan and Wenzhou merchants were both transacting, and market sentiment was slightly higher. Prices for 10-count coarse yarn and 32-count fine yarn remained firm, while 20-count yarn was flat. In the end, total transactions from all parties for the day were 2,470 bales, with inter-trade accounting for more than half. Prices for 20-count "Double Horse" and "Celestial Maiden" brands were flat, while "Golden City" brand rose by 1 yuan, 10-count coarse yarn rose by 2 yuan, and 32-count fine yarn soared by about 5 yuan. The factory side offered 50 bales of 42-count "Pine Deer" from the Xinhuo Factory at a price of 500 yuan. Shenxin offered 500 bales of 10-count "Yizi Army" at a price of 297.5 yuan. Anda Factory offered 150 bales of 10-count "Flying Tiger" at a price of 288.5 yuan. Hefeng Yarn Factory offered 300 bales of 10-count "Red Lotus Bee" at a price of 285 yuan. Today's exports include 385 pieces to Shantou, 7 pieces to Xiamen, 530 pieces to Hong Kong, 40 pieces to Yantai, and 435 pieces to Tianjin. Yesterday's imported yarn from Ningbo amounted to 300 pieces. The amounts purchased by each merchant are listed on the left:

Inter-trade: 1,650 bales; Xiamen: 10 bales

Jiangxi: 30 bales; Yunnan: 320 bales

Wenzhou: 110 bales; Shantou: 40 bales

Ningbo: 45 bales; Nanyang: 5 bales

Tianjin: 150 bales; Fuzhou: 15 bales

Inland: 55 bales; Hunan: 40 bales

Total: 2,470 bales. The yarn market situation is unusually scattered, with very little demand from various parties. Selling prices have fallen, down about 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The current yarn price for 20-count "Water Moon" is 334 yuan, and the current yarn price for 20-count "Blue Phoenix" is 329 yuan.

### More Than Ten Thousand Bales of Yao Flower Cotton Continue to Arrive

—Special Grade at 70 Yuan per Pair—

Although there were no large-scale transactions in the cotton business, sporadic demand from factories and traders continued unabated. Therefore, the market trend is unusually stable. However, Japanese factories made no moves. Nevertheless, factories were actively purchasing foreign cotton. There have been no shipments from the northern Jiangsu region. It is expected that large quantities will arrive in Shanghai after the Lantern Festival. According to cotton merchants, prices in the production areas are very low. Due to difficult transportation, American cotton from Tongzhou is only selling for 50 yuan. If it could be transported to Shanghai, the profit would be unimaginable. Yao flower cotton has recently been processed and is arriving in Shanghai daily. Yesterday, another 12,100 pieces arrived. The price of special grade Yao flower cotton from Ningbo is 70 yuan per pair (calculated as 120 catties using the Shanghai market weight system). Here are the current selling prices for cotton:

### Silk and Tea: Prices of Japanese and American Silk Have Rebounded Slightly, Filature Silk Reaches New High, Price of Lyon Silk Still Rising

Yesterday, the silk market in Japan and the United States saw a slight rebound. Near-term New York prices fell by 1 cent, and deferred prices fell by 3 cents. Yokohama spot prices have not been released, but deferred prices fell by 17 yuan. However, Lyon saw further gains, with Japanese silk up 3 francs, and Shanghai silk ("A" grade) up 4.50 francs and Shanghai silk ("B" grade) up 2 francs. The local silk market saw both domestic and foreign sales taking a wait-and-see approach. User transactions were also sluggish, with only 15 loads being traded throughout the day. Filature silk (authentic brand) traded at 1,100 yuan, and Robinhound White Factory silk traded at 1,950 yuan, both being the highest records in the recent two weeks of price increases. It is predicted that the foreign markets may not create higher prices again. It is said that the price of Yokohama silk is limited to 1,000 yuan. If it rises further, it will truly be related to the price of new cocoons. The main reason for the price surge in the local silk market is the increasingly high international market and the impending exhaustion of domestic raw materials. However, since the price surge began, the stagnation of the export market and the repeated transfers of raw materials, treating them like rare commodities, have caused the price of raw silk to soar, diverging from domestic and foreign actual sales. Therefore, the foundation of the price surge is very fragile. Speculators will eventually be forced to sell. Exports require foreign and domestic silk prices to converge, and domestic use requires silk mills to be able to digest them appropriately. Therefore, even if silk prices may rise again, the crisis has not disappeared. For example, the local silk mills have stopped operating night shifts to save raw materials and observe the silk market. This is a preliminary symptom of the abnormal development of the domestic sales market. Yesterday, 4,320 pieces of tea arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo.

### Oil Market: Soybean Cake is Controlled by Dalian Cake; Xintai Solely Manages

Soybean Cake: The market situation was entirely controlled by Dasu cake yesterday, resulting in no transactions for other cakes. It is heard that Xintai Luo will exclusively manage Dalian cake. It is estimated that more than 2,000 pieces of current Guangbian cake were sold at a price of 3.123 yuan. Orders for more than 10,000 pieces for delivery in April and May were placed at a price of 3.20 yuan.

Soybean Oil: Under the dual pressure of rising prices in the production area and exchange rates, prices rose again by 0.50 to 0.60 yuan. Wholesale shipments by train and truck are starting to stir during this Lantern Festival season. Therefore, many traders are actively buying. It is estimated that 700 barrels of current Dalian oil were transacted, with prices rising from 28.70 yuan to 29 yuan. Orders for 200 barrels for delivery in late February were placed at prices of 28.79 yuan. 150 large baskets of oil were sold at a price of 26.20 yuan. 50 barrels of Fengnian oil were sold at a price of 28.40 yuan. 100 baskets of Lianqi oil were sold at prices ranging from 26.50 yuan to 26.70 yuan.

Raw Oil: Production prices are high, sources are scarce, and inventories are dwindling. Furthermore, soybean oil is tight, and Zhejiang merchants are quite active. Therefore, prices rose again by 0.60 to 0.70 yuan. It is estimated that more than 700 pieces of Jiaozhou oil and more than 200 cans of Qingdao canned oil were transacted.

### American Cotton Purchased by Japanese Factories Arrives Today

The foreign cotton market: New York cotton market is quite firm. Cloth sales are increasing daily. Senator Smith's cotton proposal will be slightly revised within the next few days and should be passed. Regarding the issue of selling loan cotton, although various parties have requested the government to release some first, according to the current situation, the release of loan cotton is unlikely to be implemented this year. Therefore, sentiment is unusually strong, and the cotton market is viewed favorably. Yesterday, New York rose by 1 to 4 points, India was closed, but it is predicted to rise by 1 rupee, and Egypt rose by more than 10 points. The exchange rate is also weak. Converted to legal currency, American and Brazilian cotton each rose by 0.60 yuan per picul, Indian cotton rose by 0.40 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 1 yuan.

Transactions in the Shanghai foreign cotton market turned quiet yesterday. Only Anda Factory ordered 300 bales of Indian cotton "Pingguoer" at a delivered-to-factory price of 59.75 yuan, and another 300 bales of "Bai Luoqu" at a price of 71.10 yuan, decorating the cotton market. Japanese factories made no transactions. Furthermore, the Guangyao ship will arrive today, carrying more than 15,000 bales of American cotton, and will berth at the Huangpu Wharf. Most of the American cotton being transported this time was purchased by Japanese factories.

### Woolen Fabrics: Spring Woolen Fabrics are Congested in the Mail

Recently, merchants from all regions have made substantial transactions in woolen fabrics. Merchants from Tianjin and Hebei are actively stocking up, mostly for Western-style suit materials. Merchants from goods-splitting businesses also had sales, and there were many parcels sent out through the post office, causing congestion. Spring goods accounted for 70%, while summer goods such as French flannel and rubber cloth accounted for 30%. Shipments from other places, such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, were also steady.

Spring and Autumn

### Bittersweet Scheme

—Liu Feng

When I was young, reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms, I always felt very disapproving of Huang Gai's use of the "bittersweet scheme," because if the "bittersweet scheme" failed, wouldn't it be a waste to sacrifice a fierce general? The "bittersweet scheme" is temporary, only suitable for trickery, while a fierce general is such a precious asset in the continuation of war!

However, the reason why the "bittersweet scheme" is used in tactics can really be said to be because there is "no other way." Since it has reached the point of "no other way," naturally, one cannot care whether the "bittersweet scheme" is a risky move. As a result, although the "bitterness" is "internal," the "scheme" is still not sold, resulting in a "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice," which is precisely "reaping what one sows."

Just to give an example, such as the so-called "bomb case" on Nanjing Road the night before last, if it had occurred at a time when a certain party was not attacking the concession, no one would have suspected it. But now this "bomb case" inevitably carries the flavor of a "bittersweet scheme." This is one; secondly, the distribution of leaflets "Advising Dancing Friends," although the content is quite intense, in this time of national crisis, is there still conscience to dance and make merry? The signatory below is also "Blood Soul Assassination Squad." However, small feet trying to fit into big shoes always reveal some flaws. For example, the sentences in that leaflet have a bit of a "flirty aura." As long as you pay attention to the "puppet newspapers," you can understand.

Such a "bittersweet scheme" really startled the so-called "dancing friends," who felt that the dance halls were not really paradises, and that paradise seemed to be lacking. Therefore, they fled the dance halls in dismay and went home to "behave themselves"! But has the "real purpose" been achieved? The answer is no! And it fully exposes that the tactics have indeed reached the "no other way" situation.

### Talking About School Publications

—Ci Kai

School publications are originally published by the school administration or the publishing department of student organizations, and are distributed exclusively to teachers and students within the school for reading. However, many schools also sell these publications outside the school, or circulate them among schools, serving the purpose of mutual learning, or entering the ranks of publications to expand their influence. This is a transformation of school publications. Although these publications are rare in bookstores, they can be regarded as a category among Shanghai's publications. These school publications are not magazines needed by the general public, so publishers often feel the difficulty of circulation. For the sake of systematic understanding, I will classify school publications into two categories as follows:

(1) School Circulating

Such as "The Axle" of Huai Jiu Girls' High School. (Omitted)

(2) Social Circulating

That is, the publications that will be described in this article. As far as the author knows, there are only four types, half of which have been discontinued, and the other one's continuation is unknown.

School News: Launched about five or six months ago. The editorial force is the East China United Middle School, belonging to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education. The target schools are mainly Zhejiang schools. The main materials are news (including universities and middle schools in the inland) and descriptions of school life. Therefore, it is the only communication link between island schools and inland schools, and is especially popular among those who care about middle schools in Zhejiang. This publication was originally a bi-weekly, but due to issues with sourcing and printing, it was repeatedly delayed. Due to cost concerns, it reverted to school circulation after four or five issues. It ceased publication after six issues. However, its original body in Hangzhou has a history of more than seventy issues (it was a weekly at the time). It used the same name when it moved to Shanghai, and the style was roughly the same as before. This publication is rarely seen in bookstores, and most of it is sent to schools for promotion. Although each issue sold up to four or five hundred copies, almost all the buyers were students.

Academic Weekly: Launched later than "School News," the editor is an unknown school on Jiangxi Road. It is a school publication of the student garden type. The content includes essays, literature, science, comics, etc. It is more commonly seen in bookstores than "School News." Sales were poor, and it ceased publication after seven or eight issues.

Giant Wheel Monthly: The editor is a student organization of Shanghai Middle School. The nature is the same as "Academic Weekly," but it has a thick paper cover. Although there are some works by teachers in the content, the editing and material selection are still immature, and it contains materials of low taste. Only two issues have been published to date.

University Student: Published by students of Soochow University. The rest is unknown.

School publications have repeatedly failed in competition in the market. They rise and fall, mostly due to poor sales. There are four reasons for this: (1) School publications mainly focus on student creations. Student creations are mostly maiden works, so many are shallow, and even if they are very brilliant, they are ignored. Articles on theory, common sense, and science are even more shallow. (2) Students mostly write about students or things related to students. News articles are all about schools, which are not of interest to outsiders. There are no obvious advantages to attract readers, and students in general do not like to buy them. (3) School publications are not students' main business, so they have no time to focus on them. The printing of school publications seen in Shanghai, including those for school circulation, is very crude. (4) People in the isolated island are busy with love affairs, and the schools that are the lifeline of the nation, I have no time to take care of them. School publications are regarded as waste paper. Alas!

### Willing to Be a Standard-Bearer for the Dung Old Man

—Bai Jiao

(Letter received) Bai Jiao rubbed inscriptions on bronzes and stone tablets, loved engraving in his youth, but the world is full of vulgar craftsmen, so he grew in arrogance, saying that there were no heroes in the world, and that I should rule the world. In the year of Gengshen (1920), Lu Mengjiao of Dongyang came and mentioned Dung Old Man in conversation. Before leaving, he insisted on meeting in the city building, so he was able to meet Dung Old Man. Dung Old Man had a large face, loud voice, red nose with glasses, and was dignified like a martial artist, with nothing else unusual. During the wine, Dung Old Man passed me a large letter, signed "Three Lengths and Two Shorts Complete Seal Collection," totaling more than ten volumes. When I opened it, it was vermillion and white, large and small, long and short, wide and narrow, square and crooked, numbering hundreds of seals. I was shocked and forgot to drink. I secretly peeked at his face, which looked to be about forty years old. So who's world is this within the realm today? After drinking heartily, I presented him with a poem. The poem said:

Divine knife enters and carves cloud teeth, uniquely emitting ancient spring, opening wondrous flowers. The authors of four generations are all lonely, but today who can boast of this matter? White eyes aloof, no righteous vision, drinking heavily in the city building, meeting a gentleman. Vermillion mud dots shine brightly in the eyes, three lengths and two shorts, my heart dies. Truly, the marvelous aura of the mountains and rivers is concentrated in Dung Old Man. Even discussing these characters, how can they be compared to the history of the clerical script? Rubbing and carving, morning and evening, the skill is so exquisite that one is surprised by the absence of Heaven's merit! I have heard that the legacy wants talent to be great and aspirations to be secret. Dung Old Man's engraving has reached this point, truly marvelous. Who despises the small skill of carving insects? Please, sir, try to wield the iron pen. Inscribe bells and tripods, carve on Yanshan, write large and carve deeply in other years. Dung Old Man will not die, and should shoulder this responsibility. Who will write the text? I will write it!

Since I have associated with Dung Old Man quite a bit, going back and forth dozens of times, I have increasingly realized that Dung Old Man is erudite and knowledgeable. Not only does he surpass his contemporaries, but he directly puts the ancients in a disadvantageous position. In the past, Nantian Caoyi made landscapes, and only after seeing Shigu Zi (Wang Hui) at his best, he abandoned it and focused on flowers, because he did not want to be the second person. So how can Bai Jiao put down his pen? This year, Dung Old Man is the main lecturer at Toilet Bamboo House, and his lectures on the subject of inscriptions are divided into six types: seal script method, knife method, composition method, six writing styles overview, interpretation of the Shuo Wen (ancient Chinese dictionary) radicals, and miscellaneous knowledge of engraving, all of which are precise and worthy of appreciation. And the composition method chapter, in particular, is unique and ingenious. The seal script is listed among the six writing styles, and seals are second to the eight bodies of writing. The rules and standards are to be emulated by heart and followed by hand. Mencius said that great craftsmen cannot make people skillful (i.e., can't teach everything), which is exactly what the former sages struggled with and could not tell their students. But Dung Old Man is thorough and insightful in every aspect, listing twelve categories for the arrangement, position, and complexity: density, weight, addition and subtraction, flexion and extension, shifting and yielding, responsiveness, skillfulness and clumsiness, change, entanglement, separation and integration, division, and edges. Vermillion mud dots, eloquent description, how divine and bright! Why is it still respected? I see that today's engravers only focus on the skill of carving, and do not engage in philology and the six writing styles to explore its source, or even mix the ancient and modern, and do not distinguish between the states of Qi and Chu. Dung Old Man teaches his students to first recognize the characters, which is what is meant by "the gentleman attends to the roots, and when the roots are established, the Way arises." Dung Old Man has two or three students who have really learned his principles. Now that he is opening a broader lecture, those who admire him will surely come in droves, and will surely find outstanding talents to pass on his legacy. Then I will not only celebrate for Dung Old Man. Dung Old Man has always had a strange name, but I have seen nothing of it myself. In the past, drinking face-to-face, Dung Old Man said to me at the table, "I have often heard people say that Bai Jiao is strange, why have I not seen you strange?" We patted each other on the thighs. Dung Old Man has a tooth ailment, and often cannot drink. I said that constantly being close to iron and stone, iron and stone clash, it is fitting that there is much fire. Yi Youxian has written a small biography for him, which is quite close to reality, and is recorded here as my literary collection:

Dung Old Man is from Shanghai, his surname is Deng, which he abandoned after using it, and he uses his courtesy name. His nature is upright and he opposes the world, likes to act eccentrically, and people isolate him, so he becomes even more distant from the common. He is generous in drinking, and curses at those present when drunk. But his conduct is like a knight-errant, capable of abandoning a thousand pieces of gold. At first, he studied Song poetry and was very skilled. Once he let go and gave free rein, his works were vast and boundless, shaking heaven and earth. He worked very hard at calligraphy, burying himself in the inkstone pond, copying hundreds of Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties inscriptions, and thus explored its mysteries. Clerical script, seal script, running script, and cursive script, each reached its highest achievement. Because of his thick talent, it emerges in calligraphy, so he can fill it with true energy. He is especially good at cursive script, with an iron wrist and elbow. Looking at his calligraphy is like seeing the man himself. He is skilled at carving seals, emulating Qin and Han, mixing with modern styles, with a disdain for the ages. At the age of thirty, he took up the gate of Mr. Zhao Gu Ni of Yushan, and thus became even more unrestrained, able to cut jade without relying on an awl, relying entirely on the strength of his wrist and elbow to do it. Commentators say that he is the only one after Jiang Cheng! There are four volumes of Dung Old Man's seal carvings and nine volumes of "Three Lengths and Two Shorts Complete Seal Collection" in circulation. (Gratitude)

### Street Cleaner

—Zhang Zhenshan

Although street cleaners do a very low and dirty job and are never valued, strictly speaking, in terms of the value of their work, they are also a driving force in the municipal organization, providing great assistance to the people living here; in other words, their work is indirectly increasing the citizens' breathing, physical, comfort and health. If we didn't have street cleaners to clean up all the dross we discard in our lives, then we would live in a dirty environment and be affected by more germs, especially in the Shanghai metropolis, where the population is concentrated! Therefore, the number of street cleaners in the metropolis of Shanghai is higher than in other cities, and their work efficiency is also better than in other cities.

Every morning, before the metropolis has woken up from its deep slumber, so many roads are quickly swept clean by them working together, and the garbage in the garbage cans in the alleys is transported one by one to a central collection point; this is the time when their work is at its most intense. After the people of the metropolis begin to move around, and discard more material remnants - fruit peels, scraps of paper, rags, rotten things, scraps, and...etc., they are again distributed to the streets, in twos and threes, from morning to dusk, rain or shine (rainy days have the work of pushing water), cold or hot, their work is always uninterrupted.

When we walk on the streets, we can always see people wearing red cloth vests with the Western abbreviation "S. M. C. No......" written on them, right? One hand holding a bamboo broom, and the other holding a dustpan, by the streets, in the alleys, in any corner, sweeping and sweeping. However, many well-dressed people will cover their noses and walk past them quickly to show that they disdain to approach them. They are a group that serves the public but is despised by the public.

Their working status and scope on the streets are similar to those of traffic police. The commander also assigns them to specific sections and orders them to be responsible for the cleanliness of that section. For example, Nanjing Road is assigned to numbers one and two, and Jing'an Temple Road is assigned to numbers three and four, so they are not directly responsible outside this scope.

The essence and service situation of the street cleaners have been described above. Now it is time to talk about their lifestyles:

On the surface, they wear ragged clothes and look very poor, but in reality, their lives are very stable. They only have a monthly salary of seven or eight yuan to more than ten yuan, but as long as they do not commit any major mistakes, they will not fall into the circle of unemployment. Compared to the general class of long-robed people who have less income, more expenses, and are dressed in rags, or the unemployed who are neither able to write nor fight, they are much happier.

From this point, it seems that we have received a true lesson: as long as you can do it and can endure hardship, you can live. Many unemployed people are always concerned about the issue of "face." If they cannot find a high position, they will not take a low position. Therefore, they wander all day long, shouting the pain and sorrow of unemployment in vain. Unemployed friends! Take off your long robes quickly, as long as you don't sell your conscience or become a traitor, you are willing to do anything, and you can always find a minimum level of living. After all, a metropolis with millions of people is not a sparsely populated desert!

### Rain After Clearing

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 5: Spring Arrives at Biyun Temple, Fragrance Floats on Snow Sea; Flowers Fly at Tiger Hill, Moon Fills Li Lake

It turned out that these old gentlemen were only engaged in their own research and did not teach classes in the school. Instead, the teachers in the school often consulted them at the academy. Taking Soochow University as an example, there were many teachers, and the people at Shih Lake Academy humbly sought their advice. In addition to debates and resolving doubts, they could also gain a lot of enlightenment. At that time, Zhu Airen asked Wu Junsu, "Is that house on the mountain Shih Lake Academy?" Wu Junsu said, "Exactly! Shall we go in for a visit? There are also small gardens and pavilions inside." Zhu Airen shook his head and said, "Let's not go in. I'm afraid to see those old gentlemen. They are very enthusiastic, and the conversation never ends. Just two months ago, there was a woman who stayed in our hospital for more than a month after giving birth. The woman could have been discharged earlier, but the newborn had some illness. At that time, there was a phone call from Shih Lake Academy every day. Later, I learned that the woman was the youngest daughter of an old gentleman in Shih Lake Academy, and his favorite. The old gentleman had no sons, only this daughter, and now he heard that he had another grandson, he was overjoyed and came to the hospital in person to visit. He wanted to see the president and the chief physician, and he repeatedly instructed them. But we treat infants in the nursery equally. The old gentleman also suggested many ways to protect the infant, but we dared not follow them. Later, I learned that the old gentleman was an expert in classics. When he was young, he had read several ancient Chinese medical books, such as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic, and he could even recite them. In our country, there are many people who can practice medicine after reading medical books, and they are called 'Confucian doctors.' The old gentleman is also a Confucian doctor. He also met with our Dean Zhang and discussed his knowledge. Unfortunately, we don't understand the classics. He said, 'All foreign knowledge is already found in our country's classics.' He said a series of things that I didn't understand, such as some foreign science that our Zhuangzi and Mozi had already seen..." Wu Junsu burst out laughing when he heard that, "What Zhuangzi and Mozi, I'm afraid our Zhuangzi and Mozi have already seen it..." Wu Junsu burst out laughing when he heard that, "What Zhuangzi and Mozi, those are two ancient Chinese books." Zhu Airen laughed and said, "Yes, yes! Zhuangzi and Mozi! Only our dean could deal with him; I had already made my escape. He is an old man in his seventies, with white hair and beard, but he is still very strong. When he talks to people about his affairs, regardless of whether they understand or not, he always grabs them and tells them, truly a tireless old gentleman. Later, I told his daughter, and she laughed and said, 'My father is an old bookworm,' can you imagine his daughter saying that?" (51)

### Discrepancies in Kunqu Opera Scores

— Chan Weng

The lyrics and meanings of Kunqu opera scores are profound. Many of those published in the market contain errors, and the scripts passed down among Kunqu troupe members are even more erroneous. Therefore, although opera lovers follow the scores to find the tones, they may not be able to get every word the same.

"The Peony Pavilion's Picking up the Picture and Calling the Picture" of Liu Mengmei is a highlight for the male character. In ordinary opera books, the opening phrase of "Jin Long Cong" is, "Who is like me, surprising the spring, a traveler on the road, not asking about anything else." After reciting the poem, he sings a "Hao Shi Jin" tune, with the lines, "Then I see the wind and moon darkly fading, on the west side, south side, left side of the painted wall, the green moss is slippery, leaning against the broken wall, why do butterfly doors fall closed, guests come and go, the years pass by, carving all the fine bamboos, already blocked with flowers around the steps, weeds become nests." Then there is a sound effect of a stone falling, followed by the line, "Oh my, a Taihu rockery, how did it break?" Then he sings a stanza of "Qian Qiu Sui," with the lines, "A small bump, crushing this temple together, making it a wonderful Guanyin pavilion, in front of the jagged peak, in front of the jagged peak, mostly flying rocks, three lives of karma, please take it to be heated over the incense burner, head down, adding lamp oil, illuminating his mercy to me, I offer wheat here with all my heart, what does he think?" After singing, he exits, and reappears for "Calling the Picture," which is another separate act.

According to the old version, after the repetition of the "Jin Long Cong" introduction, there is also a line of dialogue, "The wind cracks open the purple grape skins, the rain soaks the dark apricot silk, today is sunny and clear, drying quilts, still stained with lingering clouds." Also, after "Hao Shi Jin," there is a "Jin Chan Dao" tune, with the lines, "A small bucket lock, leaving this Wulingyuan here, why is it so ruined, seeing broken pavilions in the fading smoke, painting boats tossing and turning, a cold swing still hanging down skirt hems, not like it has been through war, so desolate, dare I say broken-hearted people are far away, sad things are many, if not concerned, just beside the lake and mountain stones, leaving you to grind the top." After singing this tune, he says, "It is a sandalwood box," "It is a scroll of Guanyin Bodhisattva," entering the main topic of "Picking up all." However, when actors perform this in recent times, they often sing "Hao Shi Jin" and then "Qian Qiu Sui," deleting the "Jin Chan Dao" tune. It is unknown whether this is a omission in the script or an error in transmission.

The Welcoming the Image and Crying at the Image scenes of the Palace of Eternal Life are important scenes for the government official role. Without true skills, it is difficult to succeed. Recently, I have seen performances of this play in which, after the music and hat removal, Emperor Ming of Tang sings "Kuai Huo San" and then sings "Chao Tian Zi," deleting the "Dian Qian Huan" tune, causing the plot to become slack. It is unknown who started this practice. If it is said that the score is missing, the score clearly has the "Dian Qian Huan" tune.

The score says that the clown, Gao Lishi, sings "Dian Qian Huan," saying, "She is a delicate crabapple flower, how could she cause a noisy, desolate, and ruinous disaster? Never again draw distant mountains as eyebrows." The government official, Emperor Ming of Tang, replies, "Gao Lishi, do you remember that day?" and sings, "How loosely piled the cloud-like hair, how tragically crushed under the horse's hooves, just gently strangled the slender throat, prepare the long, white silk, there she dies alone, I suffer so much, unable to add strength." After singing, he orders Gao Lishi to offer incense, and then continues with "Chao Tian Zi." Singing it this way makes the plot more compact and lively. The original author's writing of the lyrics and music must have been done with research. Later performers should not easily change it.

### Actress Hu Die, the "Gentleman in Retirement" in Hong Kong, to Play Yang Guifei

— Yin Si

Xinhua Film Team to Go to Hong Kong Soon; Both Mandarin and Cantonese Copies to Be Made

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, Hu Die has gone to Hong Kong with her "husband" Pan Yousheng to live the life of a "gentleman in retirement." Their residence is a quiet little Western-style house on Duke Street in Kowloon. Her daily life is comfortable and leisurely. Every day, she just plays tennis with her companions for entertainment, or occasionally goes to Hong Kong to watch foreign films for acting observation. Pan Yousheng is engaged in the import and export business there, and has set up Xinghua Foreign Firm on the sixth floor of the Bank of China Building on Des Voeux Road in Hong Kong. This business was his old profession that he was familiar with, and Hu Die also gave him a lot of help in terms of social interaction. Therefore, the business is booming and very successful. Recently, it has been expanded and organized, and the scope is even different from before.

In the past year or so, she has only filmed one film, "Rouge Tears," for Xinhua Company. Many local film companies have invited her, hoping to work with her again, but they were deterred by two factors: her insistence on a salary of 10,000 yuan per film, and the long-term contract she had with Xinhua. In the end, the negotiations failed, and she has not filmed any films for other parties to date. Originally, the production cost of Cantonese films in local companies is mostly limited to 7,000 or 8,000 yuan per film, and most of them cannot afford it. As for the Xinhua contract, it stipulates that she will film four films per year, and the remuneration is 10,000 yuan per film, without any discount, and it must be calculated in Hong Kong dollars.

After "Rouge Tears," Xinhua plans to have her star in the ancient costume film "Yang Guifei," which is a confirmed plan. Now, director Bu Wancang's preparations have been completed. Zhang Shankun is scheduled to lead the photography team to Hong Kong in a short period of time to film on location. (It is said that they will depart after the film "Wu Zetian" is shown at the Grand Shanghai Theatre). This film will still be co-produced with the local Nanyue Company, as was the case with "Rouge Tears." They will provide the studio, and simultaneously shoot both Mandarin and Cantonese copies. Hu Die has been living a leisurely life for many years, and her delicate body has become more and more plump, which is very much in line with the beauty of Yang Yuhuan. Performing the role of Yang Taizhen on the screen is obviously a perfect match between the person and the play, and she will be even more outstanding. It is almost like Yang Guifei reborn!

### Intelligence from the Literary Scene

— Du Du

Yi Yuan Bookstore on Baoshan Street, Wuma Road, has not declined in popularity since it opened last year, due to the presence of Wei Yuqing and his son Han Ying. It is now heard that the owner of the bookstore is planning to find another location because the original site is cramped and can only accommodate a few rows of seats. This plan has now been launched, and it is expected that Yi Yuan Bookstore will soon be焕然一新.

Xu Yunzhi's opening chapter of "The Civet Cat for Crown Prince" has been recorded on records, so it can be heard on the radio from time to time. Recently, someone suddenly noticed that the last word was in a falling tone, so they expressed dissatisfaction with Yunzhi and criticized him severely. Yunzhi was not willing to show weakness, and the other day he made a phone call to a Mr. Zhu, threatening him severely, warning him not to be involved in Yunzhi's opening chapter incident again, or he would take measures against him. The outcome of this matter has not yet been played out, and there may be a possibility of expansion.

The Puyu Society's female storytelling venue is now only Nanjing Hotel, which still stands alone. The others, such as Xile and Nanfang, have been closed one after another. It is now learned that Pinfang Tea House on Edward Road, Chengdu Road, has been opened as a female storytelling venue, extending the Puyu Society's male and female performers to sing and tell stories, with a total of three acts, including Wang Yanyu and Wang Yingsheng's Pearl Tower, Zhao Meifang and Zhao Lanfang's Jade Dragonfly, and Shen Libin, Shen Yuying, and Shen Suying's Double Pearl Phoenix. It is also heard that Qian Liangzhang, a standing committee member of the society, led his female disciple Qin Qian Zuixian to perform in Changzhou and Wuxi, which was warmly welcomed by the audience. Jingzhang himself has also taken up the position of director of a certain entertainment venue. He once came to Shanghai a week ago to invite Peking opera roles. He has now returned to Wuxi and is still working with his female disciples to tell and sing the Karma Records. Although the area has been occupied, the entertainment industry is thriving, which is truly unexpected.

Shadows of the Dance World
— Xiao Tian

### Sketches of Dancers (4)

Since ancient times, gold and beauty have misguided countless people and ruined many careers. Even wise people who have seen through this still cannot escape the "name" hurdle. To put it another way, if both the lock of profit and the reins of fame are broken, only chanting Buddha and not being human is left. The word Buddha comes from "person" and "not," which is exactly what it means. The ancients said that food and sex are human nature, and they also said that after the Three Dynasties, people were afraid of not being famous. Therefore, gold and beauty are not necessarily harmful poisons, but one must not be greedy for profit or obsessed with beauty. As for fame, it is an even better thing, but it must be achieved in a way that the reality matches the name, and one must never steal a false reputation. One must observe with one's own eyes, and not blindly follow others and covet vanity. I have been wandering in the dance world for several months, and what I have seen and heard is like a twenty-four history. I don't know where to start. Seeing so many people indulging, I feel like a fish bone is stuck in my throat, and I have to spit it out. And I often use this to remind myself not to be clear about observing others, but ignorant about examining myself.

Speaking of dancers in the dance world who should be black but are red, they are probably those who once enjoyed great fame, and were later hired away by prominent officials and wealthy merchants. They then separated for some reason and returned to their former profession. From the ordinary perspective of those who don't know, their posture is no longer youthful, and their charm is completely gone; their dancing skills have been neglected for a long time, so they have little warmth, and have not learned anything new; in terms of responding to customers, they have seen the vast sea, and nameless boys cannot move their hearts. Petty tips are not enough to enter their eyes. However, young people are willing to flock to them because of vanity. The masses are misled by their ears, so the world competes for false fame and does not pursue practical learning. Over time, this gradually becomes a custom, and publicity and support are mistakenly regarded as the mother of success, which is a great sigh!

There is also a type of dancer whose posture and skills are mediocre. In order to invite more help and support, they have to adopt an open-door and equal-opportunity policy. Their intentions are also quite pitiful. If a group of realistic customers are repeatedly denied access, they will go to others. However, once the good door is opened, the Dharma rain must be spread everywhere. On the Shanyin Road, there will be the suffering of being overwhelmed. But one group of dancers who should be black but are red are suffering, while one group of irresponsible, dissolute employees are happy.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City's Palace and Gardens (119)

— Xu Muyun

You Can't Eat the Rice of the Opera World Without a Teacher

That day, it was Wang Changlin and Xun Huisheng performing "Little Cowherd." The leader of the military band was also an opera fan. In order to please his superiors, he used the military band's flute and some lower Western instruments to accompany the singing. It was indeed very fresh and pleasant to listen to, but in the end, Old Man Wang was exhausted, but he did not get a penny of reward. To put it bluntly, other than me, an amateur clown who specially received 500 yuan, all of them clowns were exhausted for nothing, with no extra rewards at all. After that performance, the big-name actors like Yang, Mei, and Yu, needless to say, all received rewards of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Even a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old child, Li Wanchun, received 3,000 yuan because he was the godson of Yaxian (Zhang's concubine). Only the clowns received no rewards. Therefore, these people blamed me, saying that I was blocking their way and ruining their chances. After returning to Peiping, they held a "qihang" (qihang means gathering to hold a clown meeting) and said that from now on, no matter who the clown is, he is not allowed to take me as a disciple, and is never allowed to eat the rice of the opera world. In this way, I can't go to the sea."

Since Yan Ju Peng first decided to come to Shanghai to perform with Mei Lanfang, it has been nearly twenty years. However, his name has never appeared in the Peiping Opera Guild. Therefore, although outsiders regard him as an insider, the opera troupe still regards him as an outsider. Whenever there is something in the opera world, they do not notify him. In theory, he should have taken a senior actor as his teacher. However, the rules for insiders, except for those from the opera school, are that those who sing Sheng must take an old Sheng actor as their teacher. For the others, such as Dan, Jing, Chou, martial arts, literary field, and martial field, they must all take a teacher from their own field. At that time, Ju Peng also wanted to find an older and more skilled actor in the Lao Sheng field, but there was no such person in Peiping. Although Liu Jingran was over eighty years old, his seniority was the same as Xiao Pei's. Later, he learned Kouba from Qian Jinfu and reportedly kowtowed to him, but Jinfu was a senior in the Zheng field and could not be counted as a teacher for this reason. Until now, Ju Peng cannot be called a proper opera actor.
