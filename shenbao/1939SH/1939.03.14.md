### Thousand Japanese Troops Enter Hengshui, Over Three Hundred Eliminated; Lu Zhonglin Admires the Eighth Route Army and the People's Automatic Assistance to the Army

(Beiping) According to a merchant from Hengshui County in central Hebei, who arrived here today, about one thousand Japanese troops invaded Hengshui County in mid-February to carry out so-called "purge" operations against Chinese guerrillas. However, by the first week of March, more than three hundred of the Japanese troops there had been eliminated by the Chinese side. After occupying Hengshui County, the Japanese troops sent teams to garrison nearby villages and towns, but the Japanese casualties in these villages and towns were at least five hundred. Furthermore, the Japanese casualties were not the result of any major battles with the Chinese army, but rather the result of attacks suffered by small teams of Japanese troops while searching for guerrillas in various villages and towns. On average, each small-team search by the Japanese army resulted in fifteen casualties. Little by little, the Japanese army was gradually eliminated by the Chinese army. Furthermore, according to the merchant, Hengshui County was originally guarded by the troops of General Lu Zhonglin. When the Japanese army invaded Hengshui, the Chinese army ordered all residents to carry out intelligence gathering and trench digging. The purpose of these trenches was to prevent the Japanese mechanized units from advancing, but these trenches were useless because the narrow trenches were not difficult for Japanese tanks to cross, and the wide and deep trenches could be covered by Japanese machine guns, protecting the engineering teams engaged in filling the trenches. However, before the fall of Hengshui County, nine-tenths of the residents evacuated. According to the merchant, General Lu is amiable and loved by all. Although General Lu is wealthy, he admires the Eighth Route Army immensely, because the troops of General Lu must issue orders to the people before the people will respond and work, but the Eighth Route Army has explained clearly to the people what actions they should take in certain situations, so in times of emergency, they can often automatically assist the army's actions.

### The Future of the War of Resistance Has Shown Brightness: A Conversation with a Certain Director

A certain place: A Central News Agency reporter visited a certain director in charge of a certain meeting one morning to inquire about the achievements of the meeting. The director was in the process of saying goodbye to the representatives, instructing and admonishing them with a warm and sincere spirit. He then accepted the conversation. Although the director had been working hard for several days, his attitude was still particularly excited and happy. After the reporter paid his respects, he asked a few questions. The director first said that the only achievement of this meeting was the unprecedented unity and strength in spirit. The sincere situation of each representative frankly expressing the difficulties they had experienced since the war was surprising and touching. A sense of loyalty and responsibility for life was evident here. The director continued that in terms of the war of resistance against Japan, the meeting had a firm and resolute countermeasure in the active aspect. It was decided that for the past twenty months in the active aspect, we had been fighting in blood and had strategically laid the foundation for a protracted war of resistance and had gained the initiative. We must support this great foundation and step up the steps to attack the Japanese side. Therefore, in addition to showing precise tactics of a full-scale active war, the meeting also decided to bring back to the troops in front of and behind the Japanese people with the spirit of death and fight a national bloody battle. In recent times, the Japanese people have been using military intimidation methods to cover up the implementation of poisonous political methods and to promote insidious economic plans. For this reason, the meeting specifically decided on a plan to eliminate the Japanese people's poisonous attempts. In the military, we must bravely defeat the Japanese main force, and at the same time, we must crush the Japanese people's political tricks by implementing the National Covenant method. Then, in terms of economics and blockade, we must not allow Japanese goods to be transported into the mainland, nor allow our food products to be transported into the Japanese-occupied areas, so that their economic sources will be exhausted and their economic life will be trapped in the mud of a dead city. In the passive aspect, we will focus on consolidating various political and cultural forces in order to cooperate with the overall revolutionary tactics. Politically, we will decide to strengthen political institutions at all levels and consolidate the revolutionary regime in the war zone in order to launch the greatest popular force for resistance. Culturally, we will decide to strengthen the cultural work of resistance and promote the national spirit in order to enhance the revolutionary spirit. In terms of personnel, we will decide to follow personnel laws and regulations, select talents and appoint people, and in terms of management, we will decide to follow management laws and regulations, be honest and serve the public. Finally, we will formulate simple and effective steps for leading, training, and using troops. The reporter asked about the current state of our attack on Japan. The director said in a firm tone that we are now using a certain place as the center of gravity, with a certain place on the left wing and a certain place on the right wing as two major important strongholds, using strong forces to encircle and attack the Japanese people. At the same time, we will distribute troops in Ji-Jin-Cha-Sui (Hebei-Shanxi-Chahar-Suiyuan) and the Pinghan (Beiping-Hankou) and Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) lines, expanding the area and responding to each other with wolf pack tactics and mobile warfare, so that the front and rear are in sync in suppressing Japan, moving towards a direction of renewal and progress. Now, the future of our war of resistance has shone with infinite victory. (Dispatch, 13th)

### Magistrate of Tongzi County, Kong Fumin, Commended by Order of Chairman Chiang; Feng Yuxiang Found Out and Telegraphed, Has Telegraphed the Chairman of Guizhou Province to Follow Suit

(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang, according to a telegram from Committee Member Feng Yuxiang stating that he passed through Tongzi, learned that the county magistrate, Kong Fumin, was a promising young man who had been in office for four months and had shown good performance in governance and achievements, and that all measures were targeted at the crux of the problem and were determined to reform, was deeply gratified. He sent a telegram to Chairman Wu of the Guizhou Provincial Government, ordering him to commend him. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Chairman Wu of the Guizhou Provincial Government: Received telegram No. 10 from Committee Member Huanzhang Feng, which said, roughly, that on the 19th of last month, I passed through Tongzi and learned that the county magistrate, Kong Fumin, was a promising young man who had been in office for four months, and that both his governance spirit and achievements were good. Now, I will speak of his outstanding points. From the county magistrate to the public service staff, the food is uniform, but the food costs are shared according to the proportion of wages, so the county magistrate's monthly food expenses are more than 30 yuan, while the public service staff only share 5 jiao. Staff hold a symposium once a week to review their work, exchange experience, criticize each other, and introduce model work and actions. After the flag is raised every morning, all staff run along the city or climb mountains for about half an hour and then gather, regardless of their position, to give a ten-minute speech in turn. In the four months since taking office, he has made three inspections, visiting the people to understand their suffering and investigating the pros and cons of governance, either punishing corrupt officials or promoting promising young people. In particular, he adjusted the household donations in various places. The household donations in Guizhou are set up for the district security expenses and have always been directly collected by the baojia chiefs, but the baojia chiefs are mostly unsound, resulting in many abuses and causing the people the greatest suffering. Since County Magistrate Kong took office, he has carefully investigated the actual income of each household, stipulated the donation standards, and swept away past abuses, which not only eliminated the people's alienation from the government, but also made it easier to implement government laws and regulations, and thereby reduced the burden on the people, and the banditry was also eliminated. In terms of conscription, not only does he investigate, but he also encourages the people to file lawsuits, and in addition to urging the baojia chiefs to mobilize local people to help cultivate the land, he also allows the family members of soldiers on expeditions to owe taxes and not return them temporarily. Other measures are also able to target the crux of the problem and are determined to reform. In the past few months, I have seen that the local officials are striving to make progress, and those like the county magistrate are still rare. According to this, the various points mentioned show that the county magistrate of Tongzi County, Kong Fumin, is energetic, hardworking, and self-disciplined, and is able to set an example himself, supervising his subordinates, going deep into the people, and relieving their suffering. He is really deeply versed in political essentials and should be commended by order to show encouragement for honesty and ability. I hope you will follow suit and give special assessment and encouragement. Zhongzheng Yuan. (Dispatch, 13th)

Editorial

### The Tragedy of Spain and Its Lessons

Spain truly staged a tragedy. This tragedy does not lie in the loss of Barcelona, nor in the intensified offensive of Italian and German fascists, nor in the recognition of Franco by Britain and France. The greatest tragedy of Spain was the coup in Madrid on March 6, which greatly divided the internal forces of the Spanish government. In this coup, Negrín, who resolutely led the war of resistance, was forced to step down; the newly formed National Defense Committee extended a hand of seeking peace to Franco; comrades-in-arms who had shared weal and woe for more than two years were expelled one after another; and Miaja, who had a glorious battle reputation in the past, actually played the role of the protagonist in the coup. Although they said they were seeking "honorable peace," in front of the conqueror, "honorable peace" never exists. In front of the conqueror, there is only "unconditional surrender." In fact, even though Spain is in a difficult situation today, it still has a basis for continuing the war of resistance. It still owns a quarter of the central region of the country; it has more than seven million loyal people; it has more than 500,000 brave and elite troops. Therefore, as long as the Spanish government is determined and united internally, it is fully sufficient to deal with its enemies on these foundations, and things are "very promising." However, at the most difficult and urgent juncture of the war of resistance, under the collusion with the rebels, Casado and his like forced Negrín away and advocated negotiating peace with Franco, which obviously only weakened their internal strength and gave the enemy the opportunity to attack, which is really the most heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in the world who loves Spain.

Although Casado and his like made a request to Franco for peace talks, how did Franco respond? Franco said: "We will never change our original position due to the new events in Madrid, and we should still prepare for military action.... Unless the government army is willing to surrender unconditionally, the National Army will never stop attacking Madrid!" (Haitong telegram on the 8th) If unconditional surrender can be said to be "honorable peace," then, wouldn't the thirty months of arduous struggle be unnecessary? Wouldn't the blood of more than one million people and soldiers be shed in vain? Therefore, after the National Defense Committee issued a call for peace, it immediately aroused the opposition of the Spanish people. The Communist Party took the lead, and Madrid was in a state of chaos for days. To be honest, thirty months of cruel battle experience have injected the blood of "hatred" into every Spanish person. They hate fascists, and they are determined not to be conquered. "Even if it is temporarily suppressed, a civil war will still break out in six months" (American "Nation Weekly").

The main reason for this coup in Madrid was obviously due to the wavering of Casado and others towards the war of resistance. They were short-sighted. They saw the difficulties in the future of the war of resistance and did not know how to further strengthen unity with friendly parties to cope with the great enemy, but instead thought of betraying friendly parties to seek the enemy's forgiveness. They heard the enemy shouting "anti-communist" and really thought that as long as they were "anti-communist," they could achieve "honorable peace." Little did they know that in today's world, denouncing the most loyal comrades-in-arms is equivalent to cutting off one's own hands and feet in front of the enemy!

Naturally, Premier Negrín should also be responsible for failing to prevent this coup in advance. After the fall of Barcelona, Negrín ran to France for a few days, giving the coup plotters the opportunity to arrange things. Here, we can't help but think of Chairman Chiang rushing back to Chongqing after the fall of Wuhan. If Chairman Chiang had not rushed back to Chongqing at that time, maybe Wang Zhaoming would have done something in Chongqing, which is another great place where Chairman Chiang's insights are outstanding and his handling of affairs is meticulous.

Secondly, from this coup, we can also clearly see the attitude of Britain and France. According to the Havas telegram on the 6th, "The collapse of the Spanish Negrín cabinet was long expected by diplomatic circles here." The Paris Echo also said, "Casado sent representatives to France to contact the Spanish President who resigned, the French government, and representatives of the British Embassy." The London Times said more clearly, "Miaja's formation of the cabinet is a step towards peace.... The surrender of a minority to a majority cannot be regarded as a dishonorable act." From the above points, the relationship between Britain and France and this coup is self-evident.

The occurrence of the Spanish tragedy may also arouse the doubts of some people who do not know enough about the Chinese war of resistance, thinking that the Spanish tragedy may be re-enacted in China. This kind of "alarmist" observation is obviously due to the failure to recognize the different conditions possessed by China and Spain. Therefore, we may as well give a brief explanation here: First, although the Spanish war of resistance and the Chinese war of resistance are both wars against fascist aggression, they have formal differences. The Spanish war of resistance broke out in the form of a "civil war," while the Chinese war of resistance is a war of the entire nation against foreign aggression. Therefore, the foundation of the People's Front supporting the Spanish war of resistance is obviously not as broad as the foundation of the Chinese national united front. In Spain, the "Spanish Falange," "Spanish Renaissance Society," and the Spanish Right-Wing Party Alliance (C.E.D.A.), which represent the interests of the aristocracy, landlords, and big capitalists, are almost all attached to Franco's banner; the Chinese national united front, except for traitors, includes all the people from capitalists to workers. Moreover, in Spain, the parties are extremely complex. A part of the anarchist members are still following the Trotskyite, Ning, and Mao Lin-led "Marxist Unification Party" (P.O.U.M.) to oppose the government's national policy of resistance; the Chinese national united front, under the sincere cooperation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, has been as solid as a rock and is still being strengthened. To be more specific, Spain has Franco, who has armed forces, while China at most only has Wang Zhaoming, who is like a "damp firecracker" and can't even speak loudly.

Second, the international environments of Spain and China are different. Spain's hands were bound by the "non-interference" rope from the beginning, while China's international assistance is only increasing day by day. This is because Britain and France are in a difficult situation in Europe, fearing being dragged into the vortex, and would rather sacrifice Spain. Moreover, in the Far East, there is also the "Siberian Bear" and the "Big Stick" Roosevelt, which makes Britain and France know that they must maintain their interests in the Far East and only support China.

Third, the territory of Spain cannot be compared with that of China. The area of ​​Spain is 196,607 square miles, and the territory of China is 2,903,475 square miles, a difference of almost eleven times (see World Almanac L939). China's vast territory and abundant resources are the basis for a protracted war, which is naturally much more advantageous than Spain.

The above points illustrate that the conditions possessed by China are more favorable than those of Spain in any aspect. The tragedy of Spain will never be re-enacted in China.

However, the lessons of the Spanish tragedy are worth remembering and experiencing deeply by China in the war of resistance:

First, constantly consolidating unity is the key to a protracted war of resistance. To consolidate unity, we must always pay attention to the existence of compromising and wavering elements in the anti-Japanese camp and eliminate all compromising and wavering remarks.

Second, adhering to independent and autonomous diplomacy is also the key to winning the final victory. It is necessary to strive for foreign aid, but we must maintain the spirit of independence and autonomy. Otherwise, following others blindly, like the Spanish National Defense Committee, which cannot withstand the instigation of a third party and softens its knees, is a good warning. Today, China's international situation is getting better and better day by day, and Britain, France, the United States, and other countries are giving China assistance. We must know that this is entirely the result of China's unyielding war of resistance. But if we rely on foreign aid from this point on, thinking that with foreign aid we can wait for victory without caring about anything, then we are wrong. Foreign aid is earned by China's resolute war of resistance, and the final victory can only be earned by China's own efforts.

### The Head of the Sichuan Construction Department Returns to Chengdu from Chongqing: Negotiates the Development of Sichuan Province's Industry in Chongqing; Results Are Satisfactory, and the Future Holds Promise

(Chengdu) He Beiheng, the head of the Sichuan Construction Department, went to Chongqing to meet with Minister Weng and financial and industrial circles to discuss issues such as developing Sichuan's export trade and various industrial and commercial undertakings. He returned to Chengdu on the 13th. The results of the discussions were extremely satisfactory. It was decided that the Ministry of Economic Affairs would purchase and transport tung oil for export to alleviate the overstocking and falling prices of tung oil. A Sericulture and Silk Management Committee will be jointly established by the Sichuan Provincial Government to control silk production and sales. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Sichuan Provincial Government, and industrial and commercial circles will invest 300,000 yuan to establish a hemp textile company in Jiangjin. The capital has been fully raised and operations will commence immediately. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is also preparing a plan to purchase the latest British machinery to establish a large-scale textile company to develop the wool textile industry in Sichuan and Xikang. The issue of hide exports is being actively handled by the Trade Commission in consultation with the U.S. government. Furthermore, due to insufficient alcohol production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has jointly invested 200,000 yuan with business circles in counties such as Neijiang and Fushun, sending personnel to Zizhong to purchase land and establish an alcohol factory. The sugar factory formerly operating in Guizhou Province will also be moved to Sichuan to resume production. There are indeed unlimited prospects for Sichuan's industrial and commercial development.

### The Xiangfan Comfort Mission Returns to Xiangyang

### Guangdong Refugees Return Home from Hong Kong

(Hong Kong) Recently, there has been a gradual increase in Chinese refugees returning to Guangzhou and various parts of Guangdong from Hong Kong. According to statistics from the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong, approximately 1,000 refugees return to Guangdong from Hong Kong each week. Japanese ships run one service per week from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, and two services per week from Hong Kong via Macau to Guangdong. In order to encourage Chinese to return to Guangzhou, the Japanese have specially stipulated free passage, but the Japanese do not guarantee whether Chinese can leave Guangdong after arriving in Guangzhou. Before the outbreak of the war, there were only 300 Japanese in Guangzhou, but now the number has increased to 3,400. According to Macau residents speaking to the Associated Press, many Japanese have recently been searching for houses and shops in Macau, and many Japanese merchants plan to establish branch stores in Macau, resulting in soaring rents. Recently, the "Asahi Shimbun" reported that the Macau authorities and the Japanese side have reached an agreement on Japan's use of Macau. However, this matter has been denied by Portuguese government officials, who pointed out that such an agreement should be concluded by the governments of the two countries. It is reported that Macau's Portuguese representative, Guguhe, recently went to Tokyo to submit documents promoting trade between Macau and Guangzhou to the Portuguese Consulate in Tokyo for transmission to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.

### Amoy and Gulangyu Supply Issues Become Problematic

(Hong Kong) According to news from Xiamen received here, the Japanese army will issue new currency in Xiamen in early April, and the legal tender currently circulating in Xiamen will be redeemed with the new currency or Japanese yen at a discounted rate of forty cents. In reality, almost all of the residents of Xiamen, except for some Japanese and Koreans, are beggars, so it is unknown what impact any new monetary system will have on them. What is unknown is whether the Japanese's future new currency will be welcomed by the merchants of Gulangyu. Since Xiamen fell into the hands of the Japanese, Gulangyu has specially hired twelve small boats to transport the grain needed in the concession from Zhangzhou, Shima, and other places. The Chinese side also understands this and has specially allowed the navigation of these twelve small boats. However, a few days ago, all twelve of these small boats were detained by the Japanese, who claimed that these boats were owned by Chinese and falsely flying foreign flags. After strong negotiations by the consuls of various countries, they were released, and the supply of Gulangyu was able to avoid interruption. It is now heard that the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen has sent letters to the consuls of various countries stating that all ships sailing between Gulangyu and the Chinese mainland must register with the Japanese Navy before being allowed to sail, and that all goods transported by these ships must be unloaded and stored at the Xiamen wharf. However, the Chinese side is strongly opposed to this measure. It is reported that the Zhangzhou authorities have notified various countries that if the Japanese side takes such action, the Chinese mainland will block the supply of grain to Gulangyu. Currently, the Gulangyu Municipal Council is negotiating with both sides separately, but no results have been achieved. For this reason, the price of food on Gulangyu has been trending upwards. If a proper solution cannot be obtained, the islanders will inevitably become starving corpses. The only hope is that the supply of Xiamen currently relies on the transit supply from Gulangyu. Therefore, the price of food in Xiamen has always been extremely high. If the Japanese side's attitude does not change, those who will be affected first will be the Japanese troops stationed in Xiamen. Up to now, people from Xiamen cross the sea every day to purchase food from Gulangyu, and the consuls of various countries have not restricted this. If Japan maintains a tough stance on the above-mentioned demands, then Gulangyu will respond to the Japanese's extravagant hopes with blockade measures. (13th Dispatch from Kuai Xun News Agency)

### The Japanese and Puppets Plot to Disrupt Legal Tender

(Beiping) Since yesterday, Japanese military police and Chinese "police" have been conducting large-scale searches of pawnshops and gold and silver exchange shops throughout the city to prevent them from hoarding Chinese legal tender. This search will continue until the 15th of this month. At the same time, the authorities issued a notice prohibiting people of third countries from purchasing goods from shops with Chinese legal tender. (13th Dispatch from Kuai Xun News Agency)

(London) London is currently watching with astonishment the Japanese actions in North China to suppress Chinese legal tender. The general opinion is that the Japanese attempt to force the use of a currency that has been abandoned and is very expensive will inevitably end in failure. However, the impact of the resulting chaos on all enterprises cannot be ignored. It is heard that the British government is currently considering various proposals in a very active manner in order to implement a plan that can make Japan aware of the need to stop its discriminatory actions against British people and interests in China.

### Large Numbers of Refugees Engage in Reclamation

(Chongqing) Today, an official from the National Relief Commission told an Associated Press reporter that approximately one-third of the Chinese people have been directly affected by this war, a confirmed number of 160 million people. In order to assist these refugees, the government has sent them to the interior to engage in reclamation. Up to now, 600,000 people have been sent to the interior, giving them land, farming implements, money, new families, etc., to engage in new productive lives. These 600,000 people have been sent separately to more than 30 "land reclamation areas" in provinces such as northern Fujian, southern Jiangxi, western Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan. All of the "land reclamation areas" adopt the Soviet "collective farm" system. It is understood that the National Relief Commission is currently trying to send more refugees to various "land reclamation areas." In addition to sending refugees to the interior for reclamation, the commission is also recruiting refugees to join the "Engineering and Labor Corps" to engage in the construction of highways and railways in the southwest and northwest of the Chinese interior.

### Tianjin Concessions Blockaded: Britain Lodges Protest; Japan Offers Excuses and Evades Responsibility

(London) Regarding the erection of barbed wire around the British and French concessions in Tianjin by the Japanese military authorities, the British Consul has lodged a protest, and the Japanese authorities have now issued a reply, which is being studied by the relevant departments of the British Foreign Office. According to diplomatic sources, the content of this reply merely repeats the previous explanations, stating that the concession authorities have no determination to suppress anti-Japanese activities, and the Japanese authorities have been compelled to do so. (13th Dispatch from Havas)

(London) British Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today that the Zhongda (transliteration) yarn factory in Suzhou is currently occupied by the Japanese Textile Company and is not allowing the rightful British owner to enter. British Ambassador to Japan Craigie has recently re-addressed this matter with the Japanese side, and as a result, the Japanese government has instructed the Japanese authorities in Shanghai, and it is hoped that this matter will be resolved. A member of parliament then rose to speak, asking Butler if he knew that this was just one example of many incidents of Japanese confiscation of British property. Butler replied that he was well aware of the various difficult situations, but he had detailed the steps taken regarding this matter and hoped that it would be resolved as a result.

### The Soviet Union Unites Military and Civilians: Determined to Protect Territory with All Strength; The Lesson of the Zhanggufeng Incident Is Not Far Off; Minister of Internal Affairs Warns Aggressor Nations

(Moscow) The National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its session yesterday afternoon. Minister of Internal Affairs Beria immediately delivered a speech, praising the strength of the Soviet army. He said, "The peace policy pursued by Stalin is vastly different from the policies pursued by fascist and bourgeois governments. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its various nationalities, under the leadership of Stalin, have achieved successive victories, which is worthy of pride. The ambitions of the imperialist countries have been exposed by our country, and their plans have been declared a failure. As a result, the ruling classes of capitalist countries all hate the Soviet Union with gnashing teeth. In a word, the provocative actions of the enemies of the Soviet Union have been constrained by the powerful strength of the Soviet Union. Our country's Red Army and Navy, as well as its glorious Air Force and even our country's intelligence agencies, are closely guarding the socialist motherland. The lessons of the Zhanggufeng incident have not only been remembered by foreign generals, but also by the various aggressor nations belonging to the Anti-Comintern Pact. Stalin has instructed us that we must strengthen the power of the country in every way, and we must not neglect this for a moment. The urgent task is to continue to eliminate all hidden enemies and strengthen the national institutions with elements of steadfast will. As for our country's intelligence agencies, they were originally founded by Lenin, and Stalin has further promoted and developed them. The tasks they bear are extremely important. We must now solemnly declare to all enemies that the great Soviet Union cannot be violated by others. Our country's heroic army is not only invincible, but also growing stronger every day. The people and the army of our country have become one and have become a lasting and inseparable force. Any enemy who dares to violate the happiness and freedom of the Soviet people, to attack the sacred borders of the Soviet Union, we will use this force to wipe them out in one fell swoop."

### Manuilsky's Speech Attacks Fascist Countries: British Policy Encourages Aggression; World Labor Needs to Strengthen Its Front

(Moscow) The 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its session today. Manuilsky, Director of the Russian Group of the Communist International, delivered a long speech, which was divided into three sections: the first section reported on the current situation of the Communist Parties of various countries, the second section attacked the fascist countries, and the third section criticized the appeasement policy pursued by Britain and France, especially Britain. His conclusion was that the formation of a united front by the workers of various countries and the strengthening of the people's fronts of various countries are still the two major slogans of the Communist International. The full text of the speech is summarized below:

### Labor's Powerful Weapon

Manuilsky first called on the workers of various countries, especially the French workers, to work hard to persuade the hesitant peasants and petty bourgeoisie to tell them that the Munich policy pursued by the authorities of various democracies has only made these countries become vassals and that they should join the people's front to resist. "Those who advocate surrendering to the dictatorships are mostly employees of the fascist countries, who often mingle in the labor movement and flaunt pacifism in order to deceive the masses." It should be known that Germany has not yet prepared for war. If the democracies can take a resolute attitude and exert economic pressure, they will surely cause the fascist countries to retreat in the face of difficulty. "If the workers of various countries want to make the democracies change their plans, they should exert material pressure on the bourgeois government authorities. Their weapons are strikes, demonstrations, and mass movements."

### Current Situation of the Communist International

As far as the communist movement in various countries is concerned, it has clearly progressed in recent years. The members of the Communist International are all over the world. In the capitalist countries, their number is no less than 1,200,000, plus 746,000 members of the youth league, totaling about 2,000,000. This is more than double the number five years ago. Among them, the number of members of the French Communist Party has increased from 40,000 to 270,000. The daily sales of the party's newspaper in that country are no less than 470,000 copies. The number of members of the American Communist Party has increased from 20,000 to 90,000. Unfortunately, no significant progress has been made in rural areas. The number of members of the British Communist Party has increased from 6,000 to 18,000. The German Communist Party is under the dictatorship of the National Socialist Party. Although many of its leaders are in prison, it is still able to maintain its original organization and engage in activities among the masses with admirable perseverance. Only the Italian Communist Party has so far failed to form a strong group.

### The Importance of the Mission

As for the mission of the Communist Party, first, it must demand self-determination rights for the peoples of Austria, Sudetenland, Taiwan, Korea, and Abyssinia; second, it must liberate China and Spain from fascist aggression. At the same time, it is especially necessary to expose the fascist countries' interference in the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of other countries under the pretext of national self-determination. When the fascists pursue their policies, they always use nationalism as a banner, such as Germany's actions towards the Saar region, the Sudeten region, and even the Free City of Danzig. It is a pity that the members of the Communist Parties of certain countries have failed to fully criticize these false and deceptive tactics. For now, the Communist Parties of various countries must, on the one hand, strive for the right of self-determination for the oppressed small and weak nations, and on the other hand, demand improved treatment for the indigenous peoples of the colonies. As for the latter, "those fascist countries that are engaged in inciting war are using the resentment of the colonial peoples to achieve their private aims of plunder." This crisis should be carefully guarded against. For example, the staff of the fascist countries are engaged in various activities in the colonies of Britain and France: first, inciting rebellions in Palestine; second, organizing semi-military "National Volunteer Corps" in India; third, organizing armed fascist stormtroopers in South Africa; and fourth, supplying money and arms to various Arab chiefs. The above-mentioned various methods of inciting the masses should be resisted.

### Distinction Between Aggression and Defense

In short, a distinction must be made between legitimate and just wars in the world and illegitimate wars of conquest. The former aims at resisting aggression, liberating workers, and liberating the colonial masses, while the latter aims at enslaving other countries and other nations and cannot be treated as one.

### Britain Is Digging Its Own Grave

At this point, Manuilsky attacked British policy, saying that Britain's attempt to shift Germany's attention and promote its expansion of power to the East in order to harm the Soviet Union is unknown. Britain's reactionary bourgeois policy is similar to the behavior of bandits and is tantamount to digging its own grave. For example, that country secretly supports Japanese aggression, regardless of whether it will push itself beyond the Far East. This is one point. That country's concession to Italian fascism is tantamount to abandoning its position in the Mediterranean. This is the second point. That country's lending funds to the fascist aggressor countries is equivalent to increasing the military strength of the fascist countries and predetermining the failure of its own country. This is the third point. That country's plan to attack the Soviet Union, if it comes to fruition, will not only lead to the collapse of fascism but also to the collapse of the entire capitalism. This is the fourth point.

### The New Regime in Spain Will Be Difficult to Sustain

As for the policies pursued by Britain and France towards Spain, we cannot agree with them. The recognition of the Nationalist government by these countries as the legitimate government is a transformation from secret interference to open interference. It is unknown that the reactionary countries will never be able to destroy the Spanish nation. "In the past, during the monarchy, King Alfonso XIII and the late dictator General Rivera, although engaged in suppressing the people, failed to last, which is clear proof. Now, there are those who use German cannons to bomb Spanish villages and use Italian bombs to kill Spanish women and children, stained with the blood of the Spanish people and cursed by the Spanish nation (referring to General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army), how can one hope that he will hold power for long?" (12th Dispatch from Havas)

### The Soviet Economy: Solid Foundation, Rapid Increase in Industrial and Agricultural Production, Reactionaries Completely Eliminated

(Moscow) Antelev, Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Executive Committee, following Manusky, gave a speech praising Stalin's achievements, stating, "The party and the nation have achieved victory amidst hardship, all due to Stalin's leadership. Socialism in the Soviet Union not only has a high chance of success but also has a solid foundation." Since 1929, the volume of Soviet industrial production has increased fivefold, and the first Five-Year Plan was declared complete ahead of schedule. All spies and traitors have been eliminated in turn. "Foreign enemies are therefore greatly disappointed and can no longer wage war against the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union's defense capabilities are growing stronger day by day. Those neighbors who do not know how to advance or retreat and have invaded our borders have already tasted the power of the Red Army and learned a lesson." In terms of the general economy, the number of specialized workers in various industries has increased, with an increase of no less than 1,225,000 technicians and skilled workers. Last year alone, 284,000 technicians graduated from various specialized schools. In rural areas, the number of drivers managing tractors and harvesters has also increased by 1,100,000. In total, 4,700,000 workers nationwide have joined trade unions, and 3,000,000 members of the Communist Youth Service Corps are not included. "Capitalist countries often say that our country's strength has been weakened as a result of the purge, but in fact, the consolidation and stability of our country are far greater than in the past, because our country is led by people who are loyal to Leninism and Stalinism. As far as agriculture is concerned, the enemy wanted to create famine within the Soviet Union and incite farmers to oppose collective farms, but the result was opposed by the people of the whole country, and their conspiracy ultimately failed." Judging from the income of collective farms across the country, it has tripled in five years, and the number of threshing machines and harvesters across the country has increased sevenfold, which shows that the agricultural reform plan has indeed achieved great success, but drought disasters in some areas of the southeast still need to be remedied. "According to Stalin's plan, the grain harvest should be increased to 8,000,000,000 bushels within three or four years, and this plan is not difficult to achieve." To this end, Antelev concluded, "The Soviet nation is now united around Bolshevism, which is an unprecedented phenomenon. Lenin's cause has been inherited by Stalin. Under Stalin's leadership, our Soviet nation can move forward bravely and never fear any resistance." (Havas telegram, 13th)

### Border Conflict Again Between Japanese and Soviet Border Guards

(Harbin) Near Qifen, on the eastern border of Manchuria, another conflict occurred between Soviet and Japanese sentries. The two sides fought fiercely for about an hour. According to Japanese news, the total number of participants on both sides was more than 150. Four Japanese soldiers were injured. In the past week, there have been three conflicts between Soviet and Japanese sentries, the largest of which was this one. (Express News Agency, 13th)

### Stalin's Report (Continued)

"Take Japan as an example. Before Japan invaded North China, major British and French newspapers widely publicized China's weakness and inability to fight, claiming that Japan's military could conquer China in two or three months. As a result, British and American politicians watched and waited for its development. After Japan waged war against China, they allowed it to occupy Shanghai, the center of foreign capital in China, listened to its occupation of Guangzhou, the center of British monopoly power in South China, allowed it to occupy Hainan and surround Hong Kong. Is this any different from encouraging aggression? This is no different from their statement, 'Please work hard to wage war, and we will see what happens in the future.'"

"Take Germany as an example. Although they were responsible for protecting Austria, they allowed it to seize Austria. They abandoned the Sudetenland and allowed Czechoslovakia to fend for itself. Therefore, they abandoned all their responsibilities. At that time, they spread rumors in the newspapers, proclaiming the weakness of the Russian army." "The Russian air force has collapsed." The Soviet Union's rebellion encouraged the German army to move eastward, allowing the country to advance with unearned benefits. "Please wage war against the Bolsheviks immediately, and everything will go smoothly." All this is "no different" from encouraging war and encouraging aggression.

"The propaganda of the British, German, and American press regarding the Soviet Ukrainian is particularly characteristic. These gentlemen desperately clamored that the German army had entered Soviet Ukraine, that the Germans already had the Carpathian Ukraine with a population of 700,000, and that no later than this spring, the Germans would occupy Soviet Ukraine and merge it with the Carpathian Ukraine, increasing the population by 30 million. The purpose of this suspicious clamor seems to be to provoke anti-German sentiment in the Soviet Union, create a poisonous atmosphere, and cause the Soviet Union to clash with Germany for no reason. Of course, Germany may have such madmen who want to merge the elephant—Soviet Ukraine—into the mosquito—Carpathian Ukraine. We have enough straitjackets to deal with this kind of people (long applause). But we can ignore the madmen and talk about ordinary people. Isn't it ridiculous and sad to think that merging Soviet Ukraine into Carpathian Ukraine is serious? "Think about it, the mosquito stands tall and sees the elephant, 'Welcome, brother, I'm very uncomfortable. You have no landlords, capitalists, no oppression, and no fascist leaders. You can live like this. I think you are in this situation and can't help you. The only way to save you is to merge into me (laughter). Now I ask you to lead your small territory and join my scope (laughter and applause).'"

"European and American politicians and the press, not seeing the German army enter Soviet Ukraine, couldn't wait to expose the background of their non-interference policy. They openly wrote on paper that Germany did not move east to the Soviet Union but instead went west to demand colonies, which greatly disappointed them."

"The division of several provinces of Czechoslovakia to Germany may be regarded as the price of attacking the Soviet Union, but Germany does not pay this cash, but instead allows the creditor to take it himself. I don't need to preach or condemn the British interference policy here. It is meaningless to promote morality to those who ignore human morality. Sophisticated bourgeois diplomats have said that politics is politics, but the danger manipulated by advocates of the non-interference policy, and the huge political game, may inevitably destroy themselves." "The above is the true face of the non-interference policy, and the political situation of capitalist countries is also here." "War has created a new situation in international relations, and an atmosphere of fear and unease has grown in international relations. War has destroyed the peaceful order after the war and the basic principles of international treaties, and the value of international treaties and obligations has become a problem. Pacifism and disarmament have become useless. Large and small countries, especially those that advocate a policy of non-interference, are all expanding their armies. The so-called Munich Conference's concessions to aggressor countries have created a blessing for a new era of peace, and no one can believe it. Even those who signed the Munich Treaty, Britain and France, do not believe it and are competing with other countries to expand their armies. The Soviet Union cannot ignore this ominous sign. Any war triggered by an aggressor country, regardless of where in the world it starts, will endanger peaceful countries, and the danger of a new imperialist war is even more serious because it has spread to 500 million people in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Therefore, even if our country firmly maintains a policy of peace, we cannot but do our best to strengthen the fighting strength of the Soviet Red Army and Navy." "The Soviet Union has also adopted other policies to consolidate its international position. In 1934, our country believed that although the League of Nations was weak, it could still be regarded as a tool for exposing aggressors and seeking peace and for restraining war. Therefore, it resolutely joined. The Soviet Union believes that international organizations such as the League of Nations, although weak, should not be underestimated in the current period." "In May 1935, the Soviet Union and France signed a mutual assistance treaty to prevent aggression by aggressor countries. At the same time, it also signed the same treaty with Czechoslovakia. In March 1936, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia signed the same treaty. In August 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a non-aggression treaty. In such an international situation, the Soviet Union still upholds its original intention of safeguarding peace and promotes its diplomatic policy."

"The Soviet Union's foreign policy is clear and easy to understand. First, we advocate peace and maintain business-like relations with other countries. If other countries also maintain the same relations with us and do not infringe upon our interests, our attitude will remain unchanged. Second, for neighboring countries that share borders with the Soviet Union, we maintain friendly relations with them. If these countries maintain the same relations with us and do not directly infringe upon the Soviet Union's borders or hinder the integrity and security of the borders, our attitude will remain unchanged. Third, we provide assistance to countries that are invaded and struggle for their own independence." "Fourth, we are not afraid of the threats of aggressors and war instigators. If they try to destroy the Soviet Union's borders, if they give us one punch, we will return three punches."

This is the Soviet Union's foreign policy (long and loud applause), which is based on (1) its gradually increasing economic, political, and cultural power, (2) the moral and political unity of Soviet society, (3) the friendship between our country and our people, (4) the Red Army and the Red Navy, (5) a policy of peace, (6) the support of the peace-loving working class around the world, and (7) the common sense of countries that want to maintain peace for a reason. The tasks of the party in terms of foreign policy are (1) to continue the policy of peace and strengthen business-like relations with all countries, (2) to carefully avoid being dragged into war by those who instigate war, because they often want others to take chestnuts out of the fire for them, (3) to strengthen the fighting strength of the Red Army and Navy to the highest limit, and (4) to strengthen our friendship with international workers, because they are conducive to international peace and friendship.

Regarding the domestic situation in the Soviet Union, Stalin described the comprehensive progress in the country, including economic life, cultural development, and the consolidation of political power.

The most significant achievement in economic development lies in the completion of the construction of industry and agriculture using modern technology. There is no longer any outdated technology in our country's factories, and there are no longer any old and rotten tools in the farms, or only a few. Stalin said that in terms of production technology and the degree of application of new technologies in industry and agriculture, the Soviet Union is more advanced than any other country, because in these countries, the application of old machines still hinders production and the application of modern technology.

In terms of social politics, the Soviet Union has completely eliminated the exploiting class, enabling workers, peasants, and intellectuals to join the ranks of the workers and strengthening the moral and political unity of Soviet society.

Consolidating the friendly ties between the Soviet Union's various states, completely democratizing domestic political life, and completing the new constitution are the greatest achievements of this period.

Stalin concluded, "As a result of all this, the domestic situation is completely stable, the government is consolidated, and the world is envious." The development of Soviet industry is not only manifested in the increase in production but also in the development of socialist production and the destruction of private production. The total industrial output has increased from 42,030 million rubles in 1933 (1926-1927 prices) to 100,375 million rubles in 1938, an increase of 138.8%. Socialist industrial production has increased from 42,002 million rubles in 1933 to 100,349 million rubles in 1938, an increase of 138.9%. Private industrial production has decreased from 28 million in 1933 to 26 million in 1938.

Socialist industry accounts for 99.97% of the total industrial production, while private industry accounts for only 0.03%. The reduction of private industry is not accidental but is due to the fact that (1) the socialist economic system is superior to the capitalist system, and (2) the socialist system can provide socialist industry with the latest technological standards in a few years. From the perspective of production technology and the degree of industrial application of modern machines, the Soviet Union is the first in the world. The Soviet Union's industrial development has surpassed the major capitalist countries, with Soviet industrial production increasing ninefold compared to before the war, while major capitalist countries have increased by only 20% or 30%.

Stalin then asked, "Where are we lagging behind? Indeed, the total amount of industrial production per capita in our country is still lagging behind. The economic strength of a country is determined not by the size of its population but only by the total amount of its production, but it is determined by comparing the amount of industrial products consumed by each person in the country with the amount of its industrial production."

### The Conflict Between the Czech and Slovak Peoples: German Authorities Monitor Its Development, Attempt to Establish a Pro-German Regime in Slovakia, Deep Dissatisfaction with the Revival of Benes's Policy

The Capital of Slovakia: The situation between the Czech Republic and Slovakia suddenly worsened again last night, because according to reports, 18 members of the National Socialist Party who supported the separatist party were shot dead, and the German headquarters was attacked by members of the Czech National Socialist Party. A semi-official statement from Berlin said that the German National Socialist Party intends to use bayonets to establish a pro-German regime in Prague and the capital of Slovakia. Reports from Berlin also said that Hitler and other leaders of the National Socialist Party are currently paying close attention to the development of the Czech crisis. As for here today, all places are still on alert, as if in a state of war. (Associated Press telegram, 13th)

Lichenburg: According to news from Prague received by the "News" here, members of the Czech old-fashioned political parties that have been dissolved have been spreading rumors in recent days that there will be a coup in the Czech Republic this week, and that former President Benes will resume national politics. A part of the army and the General Staff are in favor of this coup. (Haitong telegram, 13th)

(Berlin) The conflict between the Czech and Slovak peoples is highly valued by semi-official figures here, and they speak up for the Slovak people, stating that the actions of the Czech central government are contrary to the policies advocated by the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration Award (the arbitration award on the demarcation between Hungary and Hungary). "When former Prime Minister Benes was in office, the government used terrorist means against the Germans. After the Munich Agreement was signed, it again imposed financial and military pressure on the Carpathian Ukraine Province, wanting the Czech people to regain control. The authorities in the province failed to resist resolutely, and the Czech government became more arrogant, and then used violent acts against the Slovak Province, causing the Germans in the Czech Republic to suffer. The methods of the Benes era are reappearing today, which is beyond our country's expectations, and therefore we are anxious about it. The policies advocated by the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration Award are to build a new Central Europe and end the existing stalemate in the Balkan Peninsula. It is unknown that the current policies of the Czech government authorities are completely contrary to this goal and seem to have lost their sense of common sense and responsibility, but these two are essential for stabilizing the situation in Central Europe." (Havas telegram, 12th)

(London) Today's diplomatic correspondent for the Observer said that although there have been many developments in the Slovak situation in the past 48 hours, the outside world has not yet understood the truth. The appointment of new Slovak cabinet members in Prague is a temporary compromise that can temporarily protect the constitutional government of Slovakia, but the Slovak people have different opinions on the new President Schtör. The young radicals still demand separation from the Czech Republic. Another factor is that although the minority German nation is not strong in number, it is loudly called by the Slovak radicals. According to the leader of the radicals, there is German authority behind the scenes. The most promising feature at present is that no accidents have occurred. According to reliable sources, the Schtör government may have no choice but to first demand the withdrawal of the Czech army and then restore the dismissed leaders to power. At the same time, some people also predict that Slovakia will eventually become another country, protected by Germany, and establish customs and monetary ties with Germany. The German government has not yet taken active steps and has not responded to the appeal for assistance from former Prime Minister Tiso. German officials admit that they cannot understand the truth of the situation, but they feel that there is a dangerous possibility, and semi-official German opinion seems to regard the Schtör government as a paper cabinet. However, some parties believe that Germany has not yet made a decision due to its lack of active action, which is a ripe opportunity to help Slovakia secede from the Czech Republic.

### The New Premier of Slovakia Declares His Determination to Defend the Interests of the Slovak People, Adopts Various Measures to Maintain Public Order, and the Existing Conflicts Will Soon Be Cleared Up

Bratislava: The newly appointed Prime Minister of the Slovak government, Schtör, delivered a broad speech last night, declaring that all power in Slovakia should be returned to the civil authorities. As for the existing conflicts between the Hlinka Guard and the various military generals, they will soon be cleared up. Mr. Schtör vehemently denied that he was responsible for the arrest of people due to the reorganization of the cabinet. The Prime Minister continued that some new laws concerning urgent issues would be introduced at the next parliamentary session. In any case, the new government is determined to defend the interests of Slovakia and establish the independent national life of the Slovak people. (Haitong telegram, 13th)

Bratislava, Slovakia Province: Prime Minister Schtör recently delivered a radio speech, stating that since the beginning of his tenure, he has taken all necessary measures to ensure public order in the province. All civil officials in the province have resumed their duties as usual, and the Slovak constabulary has also been deployed. The Czech constabulary will withdraw from the province within 24 hours. In addition, 150 people have been arrested this time, including radical leaders, members, and pastors of the Autonomy Party, and they have all been released. (Havas telegram, 13th)

The Capital of Slovakia: According to reliable sources, the Germans in this province have transported a large number of military supplies into the Czech Republic from the German territory across the Danube River, including 1,500 rifles. The provincial authorities learned of this and arrested a large number of people here last night. Three German citizens are also among those arrested. Under the leadership of Gamasin (the former Minister of German Affairs of the Autonomous Government of Slovakia), the Germans have colluded with the separatists of Slovakia to oppose the new government of the autonomous province. In order to prevent trouble, Prime Minister Schtör has ordered the army to occupy all key military points, and the central government has also dispatched troops to enter Slovakia Province. Prime Minister Schtör recently told a reporter from Havas that the German government has heard that it recognizes Durgansky (currently in Vienna City), the former Minister of Transportation of the province, as the only legal representative of the autonomous government, but the reorganization of the provincial government is purely an internal matter and is not something that the German government can interfere with. Therefore, these decisions have nothing to do with us." At the same time, German party leader Gamasin also told a reporter from Havas, "The attitude of the Slovak people after the establishment of the Schtör cabinet should be determined by the people themselves. As for us Germans, we will wait until Prime Minister Schtör announces his policy guidelines and expresses his attitude towards our people before we decide our position." According to Gamasin's announcement yesterday that the Germans recognized the former Tiso cabinet as the only legal government of Slovakia Province, his sudden statement may be in favor of the Schtör cabinet and reserve room for bargaining. (Havas telegram, 12th)

### Hlinka Guard Makes Strong Statement

Bratislava: The Chief of Staff of the Hlinka Guard issued a declaration yesterday, stating that the new Prime Minister of Slovakia, Schtör, is not worthy of being the leader of the government. Because Mr. Schtör was appointed by Prague, his attitude towards the central government is extremely weak, and the basic goals of the Slovak people have been put aside by him. "Our slogan is to fight with absolutely no compromise against any act that undermines the rights of the Slovak people." (Haitong telegram, 13th)

Bratislava: The Hlinka Guard and the German volunteers suddenly occupied the government office here yesterday, hanging the Slovak autonomous flag and the German swastika flag on the roof. The temporary assistant Daeblansky immediately sent a telegram to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central Government, Qi Fagevsky, requesting the disarmament of the German volunteers. (Haitong telegram, 13th)

### Conflict Between Germans and Czechs

Prague: Germans in various Czech towns had multiple clashes with Czechs yesterday due to the celebration of the anniversary of the merger of Austria and Germany.

In the morning, an incident occurred at the German Hoffman Hotel where Czechs attempted to tear down the swastika flag, resulting in the destruction of the store. In the afternoon, there were multiple incidents of fighting between Germans and Czechs. (Haitong telegram, 13th)

Brno: Yesterday was the German Memorial Day for Fallen Soldiers. The Germans here held a meeting to commemorate the day, which resulted in a conflict with the Czechs. As a result, dozens of Germans were injured. Brno is the city with the largest number of Germans in Czechoslovakia. Yesterday, to commemorate the fallen soldiers, the Germans hung the Czech national flag and the German swastika flag in front of their residences in accordance with the recent minority agreement signed by Germany. However, the Czechs did not abide by the agreement, tore down the German flag, and insulted the homeowners, which caused a serious conflict. The leader of the Germans in the area, Schwab, was severely beaten by Czechs in the street. Czech detectives stood by and watched. Later, a detachment of the German Wehrmacht came to the rescue, but Schwab had already been seriously injured. (Haitong telegram, 13th)

### German Newspaper Expands Anti-Czech Propaganda

(Berlin) Reports of the mistreatment of German expatriates within Czech territory continue to pour into Berlin, recalling similar situations from September of last year. Newspapers are filled with news of injured German expatriates and shattered windows of German shops. The German News Agency also reports that Czech soldiers in Přískrěice attacked members of the Henlein Guard with bayonets, injuring eleven people. Furthermore, a Sudeten German newspaper published in Germany claims that German students in Prague were beaten, Czechs smashed the windows of German-owned hotels, and repeatedly attempted to tear down swastikas. A certain German worker was knocked to the ground and beaten. The Czechs allegedly chanted slogans such as "Down with the Swastika Flag" to welcome former President Beneš back to the country, and sang anti-German songs like "Thunder and Lightning on the Germans." When this song was sung, one German did not remove his hat and was knocked down. It is rumored in Prague that a campaign to welcome Beneš back will take place this week. The newspaper also carries a message from Bratislava, claiming that the Chief of Staff of the Henlein Guard has issued a declaration stating that the new Slovak Prime Minister Sidor is not qualified to call himself the commander-in-chief of the Guard. According to a dispatch from Budapest, Slovakia may become an independent state under German protection. (Reuters, 12th)

### Tiso Invited to Berlin

### German-Czech Border Bridge Sealed

### British Newspaper Observes Developments in the Czech Situation

(London) Dispatches from various capitals of Central European countries offer varying observations on the potential developments in the Czech situation. The Daily Telegraph's Prague dispatch states that there is reason to believe that the tension between Berlin and Prague at the end of last week has eased. The Times' Berlin dispatch, however, states that one thing is certain: the German government considers the now-removed Tiso government to be the legitimate government of Slovakia. Berlin's most authoritative critics believe that, from Germany's point of view, the actions of the Czech government and the Ruthenian Ukraine have reopened the question of the structure of the Czech state. The implication is that Germany could force the Czech state to be divided into three independent states and form a federation that could closely cooperate with Germany in diplomatic and economic policies. In this way, the demands of ethnic minorities can be satisfied without the need for the division of the Czech state, and the disputes that Poland's demand for Ruthenia to be ceded to Hungary would cause could also be resolved. The Daily Mail's Prague dispatch states that Prague officials now fear that German troops could occupy Brno at any time to support the demand for Slovakia to be an independent state under German protection. If Prague does not yield, German troops may cross the narrow isthmus that now bisects the Czech state and drive straight in. (Reuters, 13th)

### Madrid Order Restored Report of Communist Remnants Rising Again in Cartagena

Madrid Troops belonging to the National Defense Committee occupied "Independence Square" this afternoon. The Communist rebellion of the last six days has been almost completely quelled. Previously, the artillery unit belonging to the National Defense Committee had shelled the Communist-occupied strongholds. Knowing that resistance was futile, they surrendered one after another. Five hundred government personnel detained by the party in the Prado Museum were then freed. The Romanian Embassy happened to be in the war zone, and a large number of people sympathetic to the National Army were hiding inside. Because the Communist Party respected the embassy buildings, they did not intercept anyone until now. Order in the city has now returned to normal, and shops are scheduled to reopen tomorrow. (Havas, 12th)

According to a Havas reporter's inquiry, once the entire 1939 and 1940 shipbuilding program is completed, the British Navy will possess the world's unprecedentedly powerful battleship fleet, including as many as 25 battleships. According to the five-year military expansion plan, in addition to the existing 15 battleships, two new battleship squadrons are planned to be formed. One of these squadrons includes five 35,000-ton battleships, equipped with 14-inch guns. Construction has already begun, and the first ship can be completed by the end of next year, entering the fleet and beginning service.

### Fierce Battles in Northern Jiangsu Chinese Army Defends Baoying Chiang Kai-shek Orders Yu Xuezhong to Recover Huaiyin Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Various Places Daily

Special report from this newspaper: Since the Japanese army recently launched separate attacks on Huaiyin, Haizhou, and other places in northern Jiangsu, the Chinese army has put up a fierce resistance. The Japanese army has been restrained by the guerrilla forces of the Chinese army both north and south of the Yangtze River, and has not yet made any significant progress. Currently, the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu is launching a counterattack in several directions, and has already captured Baoying and is counterattacking Huaiyin. The momentum is very strong. Now, the Japanese army has sent its planes to indiscriminately bomb the area, and many innocent civilians have suffered. The military situation in various parts of northern Jiangsu in recent days is summarized as follows:

Fierce Battles in Various Directions: A dispatch from Taixian reports that the Japanese army is pouring all of its sea, land, and air power into a four-pronged offensive against northern Jiangsu. The Shandong troops are invading from Huantengdun, a town in Yizhou, southern Shandong. The Nakajima unit is advancing east along the Longhai Railway, passing through Ahu, and, along with the Hirano unit, is attacking Dapu, Xinpu, Shuikou, Dashanzhen, Liudukou, and even Haizhou. The main forces of Province Chairman Han Deqin's unit, the Revenue Police Corps, and the Miao and Yu units are engaged in fierce battles in various locations. The Japanese navy is also landing at Lianyungang and attacking Xugouzhen, seven kilometers west of the city. Tao Huipu has come forward to organize a puppet maintenance association, with Tao as the pseudo-chairman. At the same time, the Tateishi unit is engaged in fierce battles with the main force of the Chinese army in Pingqiao, Baimahu, Luojiadun, and even Baoying, all located 20 kilometers south of Huaiyin. A naval landing party of the Japanese army is invading Funing along the Sheyang River, and is facing strong resistance from the Chinese army everywhere in Dongtianzhen, 24 kilometers north of the county seat. The Hori and Saeki units are secretly attacking Suqian County from Luowu, six kilometers south of Suqian, and are engaged in fierce street fighting with the Chinese Shen unit for an hour. Japanese mountain guns broke through the city walls in many places. The Sawada unit is engaged in fierce battles in the Glass Factory, Caojiaji, Hanjiaji, and even Shuyang, two kilometers north of Suqian, and Qianjiaji and Zhang Dajia, eight kilometers southeast of Shuyang. The Furuta unit is advancing from Lujiaji, Dayuji, Zhangjialou, and Yujiazhuang in Suqian towards the Soshinsuiko, in order to meet up with the Ikuta unit attacking Lianshui. At the same time, in Yanghezhen and Cangji in Suqian, and even Siyang, they are engaged in fierce battles with the 57th and 69th Brigades of the Chinese army.

Firmly Defending Shi Ying: A dispatch from Taixing reports that the Japanese are attempting to occupy the entire northern Jiangsu region. From the 1st of this month, they sent land and air forces to attack east from Hongze Lake, successively invading Siyang and Huaiyin, and even once reaching Baoying. However, after the valiant counterattack by the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and their morale was greatly diminished. At the same time, a certain unit of the Chinese army stationed in Anhui quickly arrived in the Suisu area of northern Jiangsu, cutting off their retreat route. The Japanese army was terrified and actively retreated. A certain unit of the Chinese army has already recovered the county seat of Baoying. The Japanese army has retreated to Pingqiao, south of Huaiyin. Looking at the situation of the Japanese side, apart from the air force bombings, the strength of the land forces is extremely weak and it is difficult to plot any further development in northern Jiangsu. Currently, the various routes of the Chinese army are continuing to intensify their counterattacks, vowing to completely annihilate the invading Japanese army in northern Jiangsu. However, Siyang, Huai'an, Baoying, Funing and other counties have suffered heavy damage from the Japanese planes, and many civilians have been killed or injured. (8th)

Counterattacking Huaiyin: A dispatch from Taixian reports that after the Japanese army invaded and occupied Huaiyin, the Chinese army, under the leadership of Han Deqin, the acting chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, has completed a strong defensive position in the Gaoshiyanfu area to prevent the Japanese army from advancing south. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has ordered Yu Xuezhong, commander-in-chief of the Jiangsu-Shandong War Zone, to recover Huaiyin within seven days. The Yu unit has already cut off the retreat route of the Japanese army and is preventing their advance. At the same time, various units of the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu are counterattacking. According to reliable information, the troops of the Yu Xuezhong's headquarters stationed in Anhui have arrived in northern Jiangsu overnight and have now approached Suisu, cutting off the retreat route of the Japanese army. The Japanese army in northern Jiangsu is in a panic and dare not move forward any further. (8th)

Japanese Warships: A dispatch from Taixian reports that at 8:00 a.m. on the 3rd, Japanese motorized boats suddenly appeared on the river surface of Qipinggang, Taixian County. Many Japanese soldiers attempted to land at the harbor. The local defense forces discovered this and immediately opened fire. The Japanese army, seeing that there was preparation, immediately turned and went away from the harbor, heading towards the perilous area of the river. Also, at 11:00 a.m. on the 6th, Japanese warships and 15 small motorized boats sailed back and forth on the Jiangkou river surface. They left separately at the 7th and dared not move rashly. The Japanese continued to search for civilian ships in the river, and it could be seen that their intention was only to disrupt Japanese navigation in the Yangtze River.

Indiscriminate Bombing by Japanese Planes: A dispatch from Yuhe reports that the Japanese army is attempting to invade Huaiyin in order to disrupt the rear area. The previous day, a Japanese plane dropped several bombs over Baoying, landing in the suburbs and missing its target. Yesterday (2nd), six more Japanese heavy bombers came and dropped 47 bombs, all of which landed in the northern suburbs of the city, damaging a small number of empty houses. The people were prepared and had evacuated to other places, so there were no losses. At 12:00 a.m. on March 40, the air defense agency suddenly issued an alarm, and two enemy planes were seen coming from the northeast, circling over this area for 20 minutes before heading southeast.

Cable Repair: A dispatch from Yuhe reports that the Japanese army invaded Huaiyin with the intention of disrupting the rear area, cutting off telephone communication, and stopping military news. On the 2nd, the telephone poles between Huaiyin and Baoying (Jieshou to Fanshui) were destroyed. After learning of this, a certain regiment of our army sent workers to repair them, and communication has now been restored. Also, about 200 Japanese soldiers, carrying two steel cannons and many light and heavy machine guns, attacked the defense area of a certain regiment of the General Corps of the Chinese Army Security Forces east of the Lujia ferry in two routes. A fierce battle immediately broke out. Reinforcement troops of the Chinese army arrived one after another, and the Japanese army could not resist and collapsed back into the city. In this battle, more than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed. About 300 Japanese troops (more than half of whom were puppet troops) were stationed in Liujiazhuang, Shaobo. At about 11:00 a.m. on the 6th, 40 to 50 Japanese and puppet troops patrolled near Qiaoshi and came into contact with the Chinese army, which lasted for about two hours. The Japanese army could not withstand and was driven back by the Chinese army. (7th)

### Qiantang River Seawater Inversion: Central Government Allocates Funds for Repairs

Lishui Dispatch: The Qiantang River project in Zhejiang Province, originally managed by the Hangzhou-Pinghu and Shaoxing-Xiaoshan Engineering Offices, has been affected since the fall of western Zhejiang, which became a guerrilla zone. After the Water Conservancy Bureau was merged into the Agricultural Improvement Institute, the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan seawall project was assigned to the local government. Due to the project's importance and lack of technical personnel, the local government was unable to cope. Therefore, the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan section Engineering Office was re-established in July of last year, under the jurisdiction of the Third District Commissioner's Office. In January of this year, it was placed directly under the Construction Department. Repairing the dangerous seawalls is difficult due to funding shortages, and the plan cannot be advanced. Moreover, in the Haining area of the Hangzhou-Pinghu section, over a thousand *mu* have been inundated, and repairs have not been carried out. There are hundreds of meters of breaches, causing seawater inversion, which damages farmland and results in huge losses. Engineers were dispatched at great risk to cross the river and investigate. Among them, the "Shuo," "Gan," "Wu," and "Ding" sections have the most severe breaches. It is currently planned to build temporary earthen seawalls. Furthermore, the "Wu," "Duo," and "Shi" stone seawalls are also in imminent danger. If they are breached by the tide, the consequences would be very serious. In addition, the "Mi" sloped seawall is also damaged and it is planned to build an earthen backup wall. Other places such as Huayue Temple and Chen Tiangang are riddled with holes and need to be repaired and reinforced, the damage is incalculable. As for the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan Jianghai seawall, the Xijiang seawall is fraught with danger and should also be reinforced. The embankment body and water carrying areas of Tantou in Linpu, the embankment body and water carrying areas from Dongjiabu to Zhenhai Temple, the He Pan water carrying dam, the Kaihongji dike, and the earthworks attached to the coastal seawall should all be dealt with in order. Recently, the central government and the provincial government have jointly allocated a total of 400,000 yuan for seawall public works. The Construction Department has drafted a repair project plan and submitted it to the provincial government for deliberation and decision. A temporary engineering office for the Jianghai seawall in Zhejiang Province will be established, and the Shaoxing-Xiaoshan section Engineering Office will be placed under its jurisdiction. In addition, a Hangzhou-Pinghu seawall Engineering Office will be established in Haining, and personnel and engineers will be dispatched to cross the river to work. However, because this area is a guerrilla zone, there is always the possibility of being attacked by the Japanese army. Therefore, the salaries of the engineering staff will be discussed and decided.

### Yunnan-Burma Area Becomes Increasingly Prosperous, Financial Center Shifts to Yunnan Province: Various Banks Prepare to Establish Branches, Industrial Circles Actively Engage in Development

Hong Kong Dispatch: The situation in South China has shifted, and transportation between Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Wuhan is blocked. The sea route for China has shifted to the Yunnan-Burma-Guangxi-Vietnam line. All goods enter and exit through this route, and the center of our finance and economy has also shifted to this area. In the past three or four months, all measures have been gradually completed. At the same time, the central authorities, in order to concentrate manpower and financial resources to actively develop the rich resources of the southwest and lay a new foundation for the rear, are encouraging compatriots at home and abroad to assist the government in investing in the southwestern border provinces, developing resources, and using them as a backing for national reconstruction. Therefore, the strongholds along the main transportation lines in Yunnan, Burma, Guangxi, and Vietnam are now consolidating finance and cargo transportation to adapt to the needs of the times, intensifying their development, and promoting them in an orderly manner. Imperceptibly, they have become a major driving force for national reconstruction, shouldering the important new mission of the future rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Major Banks Expand Their Businesses: Under the current situation, major figures in the domestic and foreign banking industries, in order to seize the opportunity to develop their businesses, connect domestic and foreign industries, and promote the prosperity of the southwest industry, are accelerating the organization of branches in Kunming, Yangon, and Haiphong. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Guangdong Provincial Bank, and Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank are all actively planning to open branches in the above-mentioned areas. Some have already announced their establishment, while others are still in the planning stage. The manager of the Kunming branch of the Bank of Communications, Mr. Lu, and the manager of the Kunming branch of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Mr. Shunxian, who had recently traveled to Hong Kong, have already left Hong Kong and are taking the Haiphong-Saigon route to Yangon and then to Kunming. They will inspect the local commercial situation along the way and prepare to plan the establishment of more branches in Vietnam and Burma. According to news from the banking circles in Hong Kong, overseas Chinese banks in Singapore are also sending representatives back to Kunming to inspect and plan the organization of branches. Looking at the current domestic and foreign financiers, all are shifting their attention to Yunnan, Burma, and Vietnam, considering how to develop the financial economy in these areas so that the financial and economic axis can be fully established in the strongholds along this transportation line in a short period of time, enhancing the economic construction of the southwest. Industrial Magnates Flock to Yunnan and Burma: It has also been found that industrialists and manufacturers from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Wuhan are now focused on the Yunnan-Burma-Guangxi-Vietnam transportation lines, which are becoming increasingly smooth and connected, with cargo transportation concentrated there. The financial and economic center is also gradually shifting. Those who were previously active in Guangdong, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Wuhan are now moving to Kunming, Yangon, and Haiphong-Saigon. Therefore, in order to develop their own businesses and promote the industrial resources of the southwest, they must seize the opportunity to establish branches or factories in Kunming, Yangon, and other places, and engage in development. In addition to dispatching special personnel to Kunming and Yangon to conduct on-the-ground investigations and prepare to start planning, they are now personally traveling to conduct close inspections and considerations, hoping to complete all the implementation plans as soon as possible. The progress of this matter is of particular concern to manufacturers. Major shareholders of cotton art manufacturing factories and weaving factories in Hong Kong and Guangdong, the Shanghai New New Weaving Factory, and the Kang Yuan Canned Food Factory have already gone to Yunnan. Businessmen from Hong Kong and Guangdong have also gone to investigate the mineral resources in various parts of Yunnan, preparing to quickly raise huge amounts of capital for mining and assist in the development of light and heavy industries.

### Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps: Declaration of the Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Corps

The Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Corps of the Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps issued a declaration yesterday stating that the Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps is the new and only revolutionary organization and has been recognized unanimously throughout the country. This is the inevitable result of China's historical development and the requirements of the current stage of the Chinese revolution: First, to concentrate revolutionary forces to strive for the final victory in the war of resistance; second, to mobilize revolutionary forces to build a new foundation for a new China based on the Three Principles of the People; third, to cultivate new, continuous revolutionary forces. The Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps was created to meet these needs, and the importance of this great mission cannot be overstated. The Central Corps Headquarters of the Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps, wishing to carry out new revolutionary work in the Jiangnan area, has established the Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Corps to accelerate the organization of lower-level groups in order to lay a new revolutionary foundation. After three months of active preparation, the Preparatory Office of the Jiangnan Corps has established lower-level groups from Nanjing and Shanghai to the Shanghai-Hangzhou area. Especially in Shanghai, in an extremely harsh environment and surrounded by dark forces, the extension of revolutionary forces has achieved a successful and vigorous appearance, and has imperceptibly become the main force in the war of resistance and national construction.

However, the Jiangnan area, under the oppression of the enemy, has formed an entire dark world. All reactionary forces are taking the opportunity to extend themselves. Not only are feudal remnants using the name of revolutionary forces to swindle and extort, but Japanese imperialism is also cleverly using the name of revolutionary forces to pass off fish eyes for pearls and undermine the Chinese revolution. This is something we deeply resent. Now, in addition to actively intensifying our work to suppress all reactionary attempts, we hope that authorities from all walks of life will be vigilant and severely crack down on them. Under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, we must unite and work together to develop revolutionary forces. Although the Jiangnan Corps has only had a short three-month preparation period, it has received enthusiastic support from all walks of life, giving us many conveniences in our work. This is something we are very excited and grateful for. We will work harder with a spirit of tenacious revolution in order to quickly expand the corps and spread the new life of the revolution throughout the entire Jiangnan area.

### Chen Lijiang Discusses Chinese Education in the Past Year (4)

Finally, we must not forget the many moving stories of our educational comrades in the occupied areas. For example, in Beiping, although some dregs of the education community have served as tools of Japanese imperialism, the majority of educational comrades who are loyal, patriotic, and sworn not to set foot in the dark world still prevails. As far as is known, in the Beiping area, Feng Zixun, Wang Xihui, Qian Xuantong, Dai Junren, and others are sworn not to submit to the enemy. For example, when the puppet organization in Beiping forced students to participate in a parade celebrating the fall of Xuzhou, some students from a normal school, motivated by patriotic fervor, angrily tore up the slogan banners they held in their hands. It can be seen that the Japanese invaders' enslavement education has not only failed but has only made the youth in the occupied areas more loyal and heroic under intense oppression and stimulation. For example, in Shanghai, there is the tragic fact that Feng Guohua, the former director of the Shishan County Education Bureau, mobilized the people in Qingpu to organize a guerrilla team and fought bravely against the enemy and puppets, sacrificing his life for his country. These are all things that everyone already knows. There are countless other loyal and courageous comrades and their heroic battles that are unknown to everyone. This kind of steadfast integrity and heroic battle is not only the glory of our education community but also the most definite guarantee that the Japanese invaders will inevitably be defeated and our nation will inevitably rise. In summary, from the perspective of our creation, Chinese education in this year has not only gained a unanimous and accurate understanding in terms of theory but is also facing the mission of the times and making multifaceted efforts towards new and progressive advancement, and marching forward towards the bright future of national liberation. This year, Chinese education has seen both the enemy's destruction and our creation. We have briefly overviewed both. We are saddened by what we have seen of the enemy's destruction, and we are excited by what we have seen of our creation. Because we have seen the enemy's destruction and also seen our creation, we will never be discouraged by the enemy's ferocity. On the contrary, the enemy's ferocity has only helped us to develop deeper grief and anger and a more determined and courageous ambition to strive and work tirelessly. Because we have seen our creation and also seen the enemy's destruction, we will never be complacent with a little bit of innovation and progress. On the contrary, we will use this year's efforts as a foundation, and on this foundation, let us work harder with down-to-earth work, a fact-seeking attitude, and a constantly progressing spirit, and move forward to a greater and brighter path. The year 1938 of the Republic of China has passed. Let us all make a vow that we will not be afraid of violence, we will never be complacent, and we are prepared to exhaust our heart and strength under the enemy's more frantic and cruel destruction, to play the role of education, to open up the nation's wisdom, to thoroughly defeat the enemy, to eliminate this executioner of Eastern civilization, and to recreate our bright and splendid Chinese civilization and build our great and progressive culture in such efforts and struggles.

### Securities: Rumors of Changes in Banknote Redemption Methods, Domestic Debt Will Not Be Small for the Time Being, There is Talk of 40% Gold and 60% Unified Bonds

The unofficial securities market fell yesterday due to profit-taking by the bulls, but after a period of ups and downs, prices were still firm, seemingly driven by the majority's sentiment. Although the 20th and other parties slightly reduced their holdings, it is feared that it has not changed their original bullish policy. According to news from the financial sector, the previous method of redeeming banknotes with silver has been slightly changed to 40% unified public bonds and 60% gold, fully redeeming the banknotes. The public bonds are valued at the legal price before August 13, and gold is valued at 1,950 yuan per tael (ten taels). With this method, redeemers can earn 500 to 600 yuan per 10,000 yuan. The government can recover gold, and the public bonds can increase in value. However, few people know about this new method, so the market price is still fluctuating. Once people realize this, the market price should turn upwards. There are also rumors in the market that a peaceful atmosphere is brewing again, and the market price will usher in a second wave of increases. After the market opened yesterday morning, the 20th slightly sold off, leading many to believe that the bulls were taking profits. The 15th, Dafeng and Tongkang, also sold off, either liquidating their positions or buying in. The price stabilized. The 14th, Lianhe and Maoda, both absorbed the selling. The market price fell by five to eight and a half jiao. In the afternoon, the 5th, 11th, and Tongkang continued to sell, but Yongkang, Lianhe, Hengfu, and retail investors all bought in, and the trend turned from weak to firm. The market price rebounded by one to three jiao. After two days of weakness, the bulls still seem to have the upper hand, because the bulls have a longer-term view, while the bears have a very short-term view. Because the environment is favorable for the bulls, the bears still feel that there is no opportunity to take advantage of, and they may change their tactics. As a result, the market price generally continued to rise by four and a half to seven jiao. The total turnover was estimated to be around one million yuan. A simple table is listed below, with the government-stipulated prices before August 13 listed for reference.

Bond Type, Highest, Lowest, Closing, Compared to Previous Day

Unified A, 57.35, 56.90, 57.20, Down 0.55
Unified B, 51.10, 50.45, 50.75, Down 0.65
Unified C, 51.10, 50.15, 50.50, Down 0.45
Unified D, 49.80, 49.00, 49.35, Down 0.50
Unified E, 50.00, 49.10, 49.45, Down 0.70
96, 6.75, —, 6.75, Down 0.10

Prices Stipulated by the Government Before August 13
A 76.00, B 73.50, C 71.50, D 70.00, E 70.00. From this, it can be seen that the current market price is still far from the government price.

The stock market traded 50 shares of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange at a price of 27.30 yuan, up another 7 jiao from the previous day.

A note to Ms. Zhao Chuqing: Mr. Cai Xingjiu has already replied to your inquiry. Market fluctuations are a temporary phenomenon. The fundamental plan is to strive for victory in the war of resistance.

### Finance: Gold Prices are More Likely to Rise Than Fall, Up Another 18 Yuan Yesterday

Yesterday's unofficial cash gold market fluctuated constantly, and the situation remained volatile. Initially, the price rose to 2,100 yuan in the morning due to the tightening of foreign exchange rates and the fact that the securities firms were buying more than they were selling. Later, some foreign bank bulls took profits and rushed to sell, and local Chinese firms also followed suit, causing the market price to fall to a low of 2,080 yuan at one point. Finally, as foreign exchange rates continued to tighten, the securities firms came to buy again, and a certain money exchange firm also bought aggressively, so the price quickly rebounded, eventually rising by 18 yuan. People were slightly dazed, and trading was still active, around 800 taels. Jewelry gold prices also fluctuated, but ended up rising by 1 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British bullion remained unchanged.

Cash Gold Fluctuates Constantly

Since the morning, the price for each tael (ten taels) initially opened at 2,090 yuan due to the gradual tightening of foreign exchange rates, so sellers were mostly hesitant to sell, causing the price to rise to 2,100 yuan before trading began. First, the securities firms sold 60 taels to the jewelry firms, with the opening price at 2,100 yuan, 20 yuan higher than on Saturday. Soon after, the securities firms bought back 50 taels from the jewelry firms and gold firms at the same price. After that, a certain bank suddenly dumped its profits on behalf of a foreign bank, causing the price to fall, selling 50 taels to money exchange firms and cash firms at a price of 98 yuan, and another 50 taels to jewelry firms at a price of 97 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange firm also sold on behalf of local Chinese firms, selling 50 taels to its peers at a price of 94 yuan. After that, the tight trend of foreign exchange became more severe, so there were fewer buyers, and the price fell, selling 50 taels to the securities firms for 80 yuan. At that time, the securities firms took the opportunity to buy again at a low price, with the securities firms buying 50 taels from a certain money exchange firm for 85 yuan, and the gold firms buying 50 taels from the silver firms for 89 yuan. In a short while, the jewelry firms also bought 50 taels from the money exchange firms for 90 yuan and 5 jiao. Later, the money exchange firms traded 50 taels among themselves, with the closing price at noon being 90 yuan. Trading was quiet in the afternoon, but as foreign exchange continued to weaken due to the manipulation of foreign firms, it also rose accordingly. First, the money exchange firms traded 50 taels among themselves for 90 yuan, and then the jewelry firms sold 50 taels to the money exchange firms for 94 yuan. More than half an hour later, a certain money exchange firm bought 50 taels from its peers for 97 yuan, and then bought 50 taels from the cash firm for 98 yuan. It was already past 4 o'clock at this time. After that, they still wanted to buy at the same price, but it was difficult to find sellers, so no trading took place. Therefore, the closing price was still 2,098 yuan, resulting in a gain of 18 yuan compared to last Saturday. The difference for the day was 20 yuan. The cash firm's price for selling its own-brand gold was 2,110 yuan, and the price for buying it back was 2,095 yuan. The current price for bullion is about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and no trading has taken place.

Jewelry Gold Prices Fluctuate

The initial price for selling jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores did not change. But at 9:55, because the cash gold market opened with a strong upward trend, they also raised the price by 1 yuan. Later, at 10:30, because cash gold suddenly weakened, they also reduced the price by 2 yuan. At 11:55, because cash gold rebounded, they also raised the price by 1 yuan. At 4:15 in the afternoon, because cash gold continued to rise, they also raised the price by another 1 yuan. As a result, the price rose by 1 yuan. Datongxing, Lao Qingyun, and other stores changed their prices to 213 yuan, while newer stores set their price at 211 yuan, and the price for buying it back was 205 yuan.

Pure Gold Remains Unchanged

The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash was initially 1,210 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed customs gold price also remained unchanged, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged, still calculated at 1,205 yuan and 6 jiao. This was due to the London cable on the 11th stating that British pure gold had not changed, remaining at £7, 8 shillings, and 3 pence per ounce.

### Foreign Exchange: Flour and Wheat Settlements, Silk Mills and Tianjin Firms Also Settling, Causing the Tightening of British and American Exchange Rates to Intensify

Although "North China United Bank" suddenly sold heavily in the foreign exchange market yesterday, foreign banks had a strong appetite, so the situation was relatively stable. Afterwards, the situation gradually tightened due to the numerous flour and wheat settlements, the fierce buying by Tianjin speculators and silk merchants, and the frequent buying of forward American exchange by the oil company Mobil. The foreign banks were also less willing to supply, and trading was quite active. Because foreign firms were also actively buying Hong Kong exchange, the situation also became loose.

Initially in the morning, London's large bills and near term shrank by 0.0625, while far term remained unchanged. New York silver prices also did not rise or fall. London gold also remained unchanged. The exchange rate between the British pound and the American dollar remained the same, with a small increase of 3 points for the French franc, and unchanged for Shanghai exchange. The American dollar remained unchanged against the British pound, with a small increase of 0.0625 against the French franc, and unchanged against Shanghai exchange. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening selling price of the bank in the morning was 8 pence and 3.4375 for British exchange, and 16.3125 yuan for American exchange. Compared with last Saturday, both British and American exchange rates did not change. After opening, although "North China United Bank" suddenly sold heavily, foreign banks such as HSBC had a strong appetite, so there was little change. A favorable rate of 8 pence and 375 for British exchange was sold to HSBC, and American exchange at 16.375 yuan was also sold to foreign banks. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was 5 li, calculated at 8.00%. After that, the oil company Mobil suddenly started buying, aggressively buying forward American exchange, settling the March American exchange at 16.25 yuan with a certain bank, and then buying the May American exchange at 16.0625 yuan with a certain bank. Later, Shanghai yarn factories also followed suit, and Tianjin speculators also competed to buy, so the underlying trend tightened. Silk factories and Tianjin speculators successively bought English exchange from a certain bank in Macao at 8 pence and 3125 and American exchange at 16.25. Near noon, foreign banks sold Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms at 56 yuan, which was also soft. At the close of the noon session, the bank's selling price was 8 pence and 28125 for British exchange and 16.1875 yuan for American exchange.

In the afternoon, the underlying trend continued to tighten due to the numerous flour and wheat settlements and the continued reluctance of foreign banks to sell. First, foreign firms settled English exchange with HSBC Macao at 8 pence and 28125, and then settled American exchange with a certain bank at 16.15625 yuan. Finally, foreign firms also aggressively bought Hong Kong exchange, and foreign banks became less willing to supply, so the situation became even softer. Foreign firms bought and settled Guangdong Hong Kong exchange from Huaxing Bank at 55 yuan and a half. At the close of the evening session, the bank's selling price was 8 pence and 265625 for British exchange and 16.15625 yuan for American exchange. As a result, compared with the end of last week, British exchange tightened by 0.078125, American exchange tightened by 0.15625, and Hong Kong exchange also became more expensive by 0.0625.

The exchange rates of Hong Kong and Tianjin against British and American exchange and the exchange rate against Shanghai will be listed in the market price section from today, and readers should pay attention.

### Rediscount Reemerges, 50 Yuan Barrier

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange suddenly rose sharply, rising to the 50 yuan barrier per thousand yuan. It was as high as 49 yuan in the early morning, and then rose to 50 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it once reached 50 yuan and 5 jiao, and finally 50 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply

Last Saturday, British gold and British-American exchange rates did not change. Yesterday, foreign exchange firms in the local market were settling accounts very actively, and banks were not supplying smoothly, so the market price gradually became tight and the trend was very weak. Cash gold opened stably, but then the exchange rate tightened, and gold firms and money exchange firms bravely bought in. People were strong, and retail supply was scarce with limited chips. Wealthy foreigners resumed buying British, American, and gold pounds, which rose sharply by 3 to 5 jiao. Other American dollar bills and Hong Kong dollar bills were in slightly higher demand. Public Association transactions were not prosperous. Qintai sold and Yongtai bought American dollar bills for 500 yuan, and then sold and Xiangkang bought Hong Kong dollar bills for 200 yuan. Chengtai sold and Xiangkang bought Hong Kong dollar bills for 200 yuan. Qintai sold and Yongfeng bought American dollar bills for 500 yuan. Yesterday's market price: British gold pounds rose by 3 jiao, British gold bills rose by 2 jiao and 1 fen, American gold pounds rose by 5 jiao, American gold bills rose by 4 fen and 2 li, Hong Kong dollar bills rose by 1 fen and 2 li, French franc bills rose by 1 li and 2 hao and a half, Singapore dollar bills, Annam dollar bills, and Philippine dollar bills each rose by 2 fen, Dutch dollar bills rose by 3 fen, Robi dollar bills and Canadian dollar bills each rose by 1 fen, and Australian gold bills rose by 4 jiao. Only Italian dollar bills, German gold bills, and Siamese dollar bills did not change.

### Yarn and Cotton: Large Holders Continuously Liquidating, Cotton Yarn Difficult to Revive

The yarn market remains depressed and continues to decline. The real sales are bleak and unremarkable, causing people's confidence to weaken. Yunnan firms have a relatively large demand, and Hong Kong firms are also slightly increasing their purchases, so the situation can still support one step. Therefore, after the decline, it rebounded slightly. However, a certain large company has a normal mindset and vomits out a large amount from time to time. Recently, it is said that the amount of liquidation is about 7,000 to 8,000 bales. Therefore, the market is slightly loose. The lowest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 391 yuan. Then, scalpers suddenly came to buy, and some people said that based on past experience, if it falls to the 390 yuan barrier, it will rebound. This kind of trading has happened several times. At noon, the Hong Kong firms bought another 240 bales of Double Horse yarn at a price of 391 yuan and a half to 2 yuan. People's confidence was shaken, and the bulls pulled up the price again by 3 yuan.

The current yarn situation: At the opening of the market in the morning, the traders gathered to talk, but the actual transactions were still sluggish and the market was tired. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods fell by 2 yuan to 393 yuan. Then, as a certain company came to sell again, people's confidence loosened further, and the lowest price was 391 yuan. The warehouse order price was 388 yuan. By the time of closing, there were slightly cheaper goods, and it rebounded by 1 yuan. The price of Double Horse was 392 yuan. At the opening in the afternoon, people's confidence turned from weak to strong due to the renewed demand from the southern firms, and the closing price for 20-count Double Horse was 394 yuan and a half. The warehouse order also reached 390 yuan and 5 jiao. As a result, the various firms bought 1,799 bales, and the market price for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 5 jiao compared to the previous day. The remaining prices fell by an average of 1 yuan or more. According to news from the factory, 85 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Ningbo yesterday. The amount purchased by each firm is listed on the left:

Fellow Traders 1,015; Yunnan 310; Hong Kong 300
Shantou 55; Xiamen 5; Mainland 60
Ningbo 15; Wenzhou 19
Total: 1,799

Although the demand in the yarn market yesterday was sluggish, the market sentiment improved slightly. The current yarn price for 20-count Water Moon is 334.5 yuan, and the current yarn price for 20-count Blue Phoenix is 324.5 yuan, which is about 1 yuan higher than the price at the weekend. Recently, large players have both long and short positions, so the market sentiment is average.

### American Cotton: Factories are Requesting Samples

The market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market was unexpectedly impacted by the failure of Smith's cotton industry proposal to proceed smoothly, and the various traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Southern traders were actively selling short, and the bulls took profits. As a result, the New York cotton market turned from sluggish to tired, falling by 5 to 6 pound coins. This year's Indian cotton is expected to have a poor harvest, and prices are difficult to fall. Yesterday, together with the forecast, it rose by another 1 Robi and a half. Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 pound coins. There was no significant change in the exchange rate. Converted into legal currency, the price of cotton, calculated as American cotton and Brazilian cotton, fell by 3 jiao and a half per dan, Egyptian cotton fell by 1 yuan and a half, and Indian cotton alone rose by more than 6 jiao.

The trading of foreign cotton in the Shanghai market was exceptionally quiet yesterday, which was due to the failure of the yarn price to improve. The failure of Indian cotton to ship out on the appointed day may be the main reason why the factories are not ordering Indian cotton. There will be a turning point in the trading of American cotton. Recently, the factories have been requesting cotton samples from various foreign firms and are currently studying them for future reference. Shenxin Factory planned to purchase 1,000 pieces of Rangoon cotton yesterday, but the price difference was too great, and the reply has been forwarded and the transaction has not been completed. The cotton prices from yesterday are recorded below:

Raw Material, Type, Delivered to Factory Including Tax

60-count Egyptian cotton, High Grade, 110.50
Also, Medium Grade, 107.60
80-count, High Grade, 136.35
Also, Medium Grade, 126.05

32-count, 42-count American Pengapura, 87.7

### Tongzhou Cotton: Rises to 77 Yuan

The business of local cotton is as dull as stagnation. The source is cut off, the war in the guerrilla areas of northern Jiangsu is intensifying, the road is difficult, and the transportation of goods is suspended. The arrival of goods is becoming increasingly rare. Those who hold goods generally see such an environment, and hoarding the goods in their hands is particularly strong. Therefore, the opening price of Tongzhou cotton has risen to a new price of 77 yuan, and the number of transactions is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Seeing this situation, the factory cannot help but take foreign cotton to make up for it. 329 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived on the Jiangbei Road in two days, and 3,000 pieces of Yao cotton arrived from Ningbo. The current cotton situation is recorded below:

American Packed Cotton, 86.00, Yufeng Factory Purchase, 200, Cash Delivered to Factory
Tongzhou Cotton, 77.20, Fellow Traders Purchase, 600 bales, Remittance for Warehouse Delivery
Xiasha Cotton, 75.00, Also, 150 bales, Also, Also

### Piece Goods: Dyeing Material Use, This Street Slightly Developed, Eastern Cloth Fine Cloth Plummets

The sales of national cloth are mixed, with ups and downs. Due to the continued handling of more than 200 packages of white fine cloth in the Wenzhou and Yongkou ports, and the lack of spot goods of Yong'an Factory's Dapeng fine cloth, they purchased Fugui and other brands, and the sales price was slightly firm, adding about 5 fen per piece. The current sales of fine twill are not good, and Xiang, Yue, and Zhejiang firms only handled 70 to 80 packages. However, the use of dyeing materials on this street has developed slightly, and 150 to 160 packages of various brands have been traded, and the selling price is stable. British firm Jardine Matheson's opening price for heavy and light weight coarse cloth was uniformly reduced by 5 fen to 1 jiao per piece, converging with the hand goods sales price before the week. The opening price for various grades of coarse cloth from Chinese factories remained unchanged, and retail sales were sporadic. The price of light-colored bleached cloth is still firm. Jardine Matheson's Golden Three Pagodas bleached cloth rose by 1 jiao. Zhejiang Road's Wenzhou and Yongbo firms purchased more than 200 boxes of bleached cloth, bleached twill, foreign yarn, poplin, and colored cloth. Fujian and Shantou firms also purchased 200 or so boxes of the above-mentioned goods. Hunan firms handled more than 2,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and bleached twill. Sichuan and Yunnan firms had very little need because various goods were delayed too much in transit, and the number of new transactions was quite trivial.

The slump in white goods continued severely in the Eastern cloth morning market. The leading fine cloth once plummeted to 11 yuan and 6 jiao and a half. Then, dyeing material customers on this street took advantage of the low price to actively compensate, and more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill spot and futures goods were traded throughout the day, and the market price slightly stabilized. Hand goods were still willing to sell loosely, mixed and uneven, and still dropped 2 fen and a half and 5 fen per piece compared to the weekend. However, the large plates of the firms and factories have always been firm.

40 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Ningbo yesterday.

### Woolen Industry Creates Another New Factory

The local woolen industry used to have only a few companies such as Zhanghua, Xiexin, Dalong, Great Shanghai, and Daguangming. The British firm Jardine Matheson also existed. After the August 13th Incident, most of them, except for Jardine Matheson, suffered losses. Japanese firms took advantage of the opportunity to establish Yongxing Hongkang Factory in Hongkou. Outsiders and insiders are indistinguishable, and they all call it national goods. In fact, this is not the case. Because its price is cheap, Jardine Matheson and other goods have been greatly impacted. Recently, Chunhe and Yonghua, two new companies, and overseas Chinese who have returned to China have established a completely domestic woolen factory. Because it was established last year, it is named Ti Yinfeng, and its products are also sold by these two companies. Yesterday, it was heard that thick and thin serge, Haitian serge, Peng Yuanzhi yellow cloth, etc. have already been produced. Its quality is better than Yongxing Hongkang and others.

### Food: Rice Market Speculation Begins to Subside Slightly

The soaring prices of japonica and indica rice have been driven by rice merchants and vendors taking advantage of the opportunity to make trouble. In the past three days, the arrival of goods from various sources has gradually become smoother. Yesterday, 11 boats of Hexia goods arrived, and 4,000 to 5,000 packages of steamed buns were transported by truck. After the Soybean and Rice Industry Association repeatedly declared a price limit, although it was ineffective, and invited the Shanghai Municipal Council to set up a fair-price committee, speculators were somewhat concerned. Those who had pulled in a lot of goods in the past few days immediately returned them. The stores on this street are also waiting and seeing, the market has turned weak, and the prices of various goods have become clearer. As a result, the two japonica strains from the north and south have fallen by 2 to 3 jiao, and thin paddy high-grade goods have also fallen by 1 to 2 jiao. The middle-grade goods and Nanhang early rice have fallen by more than 5 jiao. Only the price of Bian Yuan goods is scarce and stable.

Guest indica rice has benefited, and the various warehouses are taking advantage of the high price to sell and the transshipment firms are waiting and seeing. New warehouses are standing by. The various firms on this street do not have a large appetite, so the total number of transactions for the day is only more than 1,000 packages. The market price has seen a sharp drop of 3 jiao due to floating households depreciating prices in order to sell. The highest price in Wuhu and Nanjing has dropped from 13 yuan and a half to 13 yuan and 2 jiao, and a small number of particularly high-grade goods have also been sold with the market. The price is slightly lower by more than 3 jiao. Because the recent rise in rice prices is not a real rice shortage, it is entirely due to people's psychology. Now that the guest warehouses have stopped, the market has fallen. The market says that the measure of imposing a price limit has been defeated without a fight.

### Flour Keeps Original Price, Foreign Flour Slightly Higher, Local Wheat Mutually Support, One Ship of Australian Wheat to be Unloaded This Morning

There are no major changes in the flour market. The transactions of the guest firms have turned slightly active. In addition to handling No. 2 Chechuan brand flour, the northern firms are also paying attention to No. 3 and No. 4 Red God of Wealth and Red Peach Blossom flour. The transaction volume reached more than 20,000 bags. However, because the factory price of the southern firms is 5 fen higher than that of the northern firms, their appetite is not smooth, and only a few thousand bags have been decorated. The factory believes that the current supply of current flour is insufficient, and the price of foreign flour in yesterday's market is also higher. The exchange rate has shrunk, and the combined price has increased from 4 yuan to 4 yuan and 1 jiao per bag, so the selling price is not accommodating. As a result, the original price of 4 yuan and 7 jiao and 6 jiao and a half is still maintained.

The wheat market is still stagnant. The source is sporadic, and about 1,000 bags arrive every day. Most of them are directly sent to the factory for pricing, and there are Japanese flour mills secretly buying them. The market has an invisible secret increase, and it is rumored that the highest price is still 7 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen. However, the various factories are currently paying attention to ordering foreign wheat, and futures transactions have been made repeatedly. The transaction of local wheat is very cold, so there is no formal agreement in the official market.

The British ship Rothley, carrying 8,881 tons of Australian wheat, arrived at the Songkou port yesterday afternoon. Because there is no space for floating barrels in the Pujiang Pier, it anchored outside the port. According to the agent of the ship yesterday, Qichang Warehouse in Pudong has a pier that can be relied on, so the ship is scheduled to enter the port at 6:00 this morning and dock at Qichang Warehouse for unloading.

### Sugar Market: Taikoo Refined White Sugar Rises Another Five Cents

Yesterday, the trend in imported sugar was relatively flat. The guild's trading range for second and fourth-grade white sugar, ex-godown, remained at $24.85 per picul. Transshipment goods were quoted at $16.70, but there were few transactions. Taikoo refined white sugar, West godown B mark, continued to rise five cents, trading at $24.70 for 50 bags. OW mark was at $24.60, CX mark at five cents, DY mark at four cents, and HX mark at three cents. There were no changes in H mark crystal sugar or imported crystal sugar. The domestic sugar market was stable. The Chaozhou merchants offered 65 bags of fine crystal sugar at $15.70, and about 30 bags of "Ti Zhuang Qing" (raised grade green sugar) at $15.50. "Shang Long Qing" (Upper Dragon Green) was bid up two cents to $13.70, but no deal was made. Xinghua "Da Gong Fen" (large palace powder sugar), especially high grade, was quoted at $24, and the next grade at $23.50. Zhangzhou "Diao Qing" (trick green sugar) is still being controlled. It is said that the production price has slightly fallen.

Yesterday, 475 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong, and another 586 bags came from Shantou.

### Seafood: Jianning Mushrooms En Route, Production Price Rises $20

A telegram from Fuzhou regarding Jianning mushrooms stated that the production price has risen $20 per picul, and high-quality thin mushrooms have also increased by $10, but the output is still low. It is reported that goods en route will arrive soon. However, demand from various merchant groups is strong, and sales prices are expected to increase.

### Tapioca Starch Stock Low

The stock of tapioca starch here, such as the "West Head" brand, is almost exhausted. The quantity of other brands is also limited. The current market price for "Qiang Biao" (Spear Brand) is $18, up $1 from the previous market. "Fei Qi Lin Biao" (Flying Unicorn Brand) has also increased by two cents to $16.20.

### Imports and Exports: Ningbo Goods Still Strong, Over 70,000 Pieces of Jianmu Timber Imported

Yesterday, 60 pieces of tobacco leaves, 220 pieces of leather oil, and 780 pieces of fresh eggs were shipped from Ningbo. In addition, 71,900 pieces of wood planks arrived from Fuzhou.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: No Shantou Yeast, Jianning Yeast Popular

Red yeast, due to Shantou's inability to export, has not been replenished for a long time. The current market supply is mostly Jianning yeast, so the price has risen nearly $10 from its previous low. High-grade is quoted at $60, and ordinary grade at $45 or $46. Sales are expected to increase further, with the possibility of another price rise.

### Medicinal Materials: Bitter Almonds - Source Cut Off

Recently, due to the depletion of stocks in the production area of bitter almonds and the renewed restrictions on exports from Tianjin, the source has been cut off. Hong Kong merchants are still keen on buying, so the price has increased. For example, goods that were previously sold at $45 have now been traded for more than ten pieces at a price of $62 yesterday.

### Coal: Wenzhou Charcoal Floods the Market, Market Weakens

Since Wenzhou charcoal was permitted for export, the current supply is plentiful. Warehouses in this city have a total of more than 20,000 dan (a unit of weight) in stock. Market sentiment is weak, and prices have eased off-market. The quoted price is $4.80 per dan for sturdy charcoal in large 45-pound baskets, and $3.30 for loose charcoal in ordinary baskets, down one or two cents from the previous price.

### Henan White Coal Off-Market Price Increasingly Firm

Since the Shanghai war, deliveries of Henan white coal have been interrupted for a long time. The market relies on a large batch of existing stock of more than 7,000 tons moved out of Pudong by a certain Tianjin firm for supply. However, the readily available goods are gradually being sold out, so the selling price is increasing daily. Yesterday, the off-market price was again firm, with Henan unified coal quoted at $44 per ton, screened lump coal at $46, and small pieces at $41, ex-warehouse. Handling fees are charged separately.

### Oil Market: Crude Soybean Oil Moves Against the Trend, Soybean Cake Futures Also Rise

Yesterday, the market conditions for peanut oil and soybean oil showed mixed trends. Although there were reports of falling prices in Dalian for soybean oil, market sentiment was good, and both spot and futures prices rose by three to four cents. Spot Dalian oil was at 250 barrels (market price details in the market price column), March loading at 100 barrels, March delivery at 50 barrels, March at 100 barrels, April at 700 barrels, and Yantai oil at 200 pieces, including 200 baskets of Lianqi oil and 60 large baskets. Judging from the slightly divergent situation in peanut oil arrivals, its market is more likely to rise than fall. However, yesterday, the market saw profit-taking by bullish traders and rumors that its source might be able to be transshipped from Dalian, so market sentiment was dispersed, and the market saw a setback. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of $29, and 50 pieces of Jiancang oil were traded at a price of $29.20 on the old terms. 1,600 cans of Yantai canned oil were priced at $26.70, and 1,000 cans of Qingdao canned oil were priced at $38. There was some actual sales of soybean cake, with merchants from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Quanzhou buying 4,000 pieces of "Da You Si Pai" (Great You Four Brand) cake at a price of $3.45 and 500 pieces of "Wu Pai" (Five Brand) cake at a price of $3.24. 1,000 pieces of Jiangbei small cake were priced at $0.61. There were no significant fluctuations in the market. However, under the encouragement of market sentiment, Dalian futures cake rose by four cents, with 2,000 pieces for April delivery traded at a price of $3.234 and 1,000 pieces for May delivery traded at a price of $3.20.

### Changes in Shanghai's Industry and Commerce in the Past Year (Continued)

— Hui

Transfer of Shares

In the past year, a total of 307 industrial and commercial enterprises have transferred shares, including 51 factories and 256 commercial firms. Among these 307 transferred industrial and commercial firms, analyzed by industry and commerce, the food and beverage industry ranked first with 79 firms, followed by the clothing industry with 53, the daily necessities industry with 42, the metal and electrical industry with 30, the civil engineering industry with 12, the hygiene industry with 11, the cultural industry with 9, the pharmaceutical industry with 7, the travel industry with 6, and the decoration and entertainment industries each with 5, the finance and fuel industries each with 3, the transportation and special industries each with 2, and 34 firms with unspecified industries.

Comparing the number of transfer of shares companies by month, September ranked first with 46 companies, October second with 33, June third with 29, August and November fourth with 26 each, December fifth with 25, February and May sixth with 24 each, March seventh with 23, April eighth with 21, January ninth with 16, and July last with 14. It can be seen from this that the industries in which shares were transferred in the past year are related to the distorted development, which is to say various industries with superficial prosperity. Because of this, the transfer of shares of normal industrial and commercial enterprises only accounts for half of the total. The number of transferred shares by industry and month is listed in the following table:

Month: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Total

### Gunfire Resounded All Night in Western Shanghai: Guerrillas Fiercely Attacked Puppet Troops, Wide Area of Operation, Puppet Troops Unable to Hold Out, Dispatch Heavy Troops to Reinforce Before Retreating

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, puppet "Pacification Army" troops have been stationed in the area of the Hongqiao Golf Club in recent days. Guerrillas launched an attack on the puppet troops last night (the 12th). The sound of rifles, pistols, and machine guns in the area continued intermittently throughout the night. The Japanese immediately dispatched heavy troops to reinforce them. As of 7:00 this morning, gunfire, possibly from the vicinity of the Jiefang Road outskirts, was still heard in the area.

Gunfire Erupted

The guerrillas began their attack at midnight. Pistol, rifle, and machine gun fire erupted from the puppet troops' sentry post on the other side of the Luo Bie Gen River, not far from Hongqiao Road. It is believed that the guerrillas set up a machine gun on the riverbank not far from the Golf Club and fired it. However, they apparently did not approach to attack, and the gunfire lasted for about a quarter of an hour.

It Quietened Down

But at 4:20, more intense gunfire erupted from the direction of MacLeod Road, lasting for some time. The guerrillas then moved through the area, and gunfire erupted in many places near the area. The guerrillas apparently retreated due to the sound of approaching Japanese reinforcements. Intermittent gunfire continued until 7:00 in the morning, but it has now shifted westward. Last night's guerrilla operations occurred from the outskirts of Jiefang Road.

Wide Area of Operation

The extent of casualties is still unknown. At dawn, Japanese troops went to various villages in the area to search house by house. It is reported that some villagers were abused by the Japanese troops, with some being slapped and kicked. The "Pacification Army" that was attacked last night was recruited by the Japanese to guard various areas and "assist in restoring order." The puppet troops stationed on Hongqiao Road are either very young or physically weak.

### Rice Industry Groups Decide to Maintain Original Price Limits, Price Assessment Committee to Be Established Regularly, Advise Merchants to Adopt Cooperative Attitude

In order to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents and stabilize market prices, the city's rice industry groups held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 and organized a Rice and Grain Price Assessment Committee. Fifteen committee members were appointed, and the committee is scheduled to be established on the 15th of this month. The details are as follows:

Seven Groups Held Joint Meeting Yesterday

The city's Rice Industry Association and various merchant groups held a joint meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday on the second floor of the Grain Exchange. The participants included representatives from the Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice Merchants Association, the Rice Milling Industry Association, the Rice Grain Distribution Industry Association, and from various merchant groups, including the Changshu Rice Industry Association, the Southern Merchants Association, and the United Rice Merchants Association, and other seven groups. The meeting was chaired by Cai Yukun, representative of the Bean and Rice Industry. The chairman first reported on the recent rise in rice prices in the Shanghai market, as well as the quantity of rice in stock and the sources in the interior. He stated that in order to maintain the food supply, the association should make its greatest efforts to regulate the rice and grain supply in the Shanghai market in the future, stabilize market prices, and achieve a satisfactory situation. During this extraordinary period, fellow merchants should be mindful of the difficulties and cooperate sincerely to maintain normal market transactions. Representatives from various groups, including Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, Shi Zufuk, Jiang Shizhi, and Zhu Zixiang, expressed their opinions, elaborating in detail on the position of the merchants and the advantages and disadvantages of continued rice price increases.

Unanimously Agreed to Maintain Price Limits

Finally, the chairman summarized the opinions expressed by the various representatives. Regarding the rice price issue, it was decided to maintain the maximum price of $14 per picul. When secondary rice was considered separately, when the right to express opinions was voted on, more than 20 representatives present stood up and passed it unanimously. The market management committee was instructed to announce the decision of the joint meeting to the market so that the public could be informed.

Price Assessment Committee to Be Established Regularly

The joint meeting also decided to organize a Rice and Grain Price Assessment Committee consisting of representatives from the merchant groups, in order to stabilize rice prices and regulate the food supply. Based on the previously agreed price limit, the committee will assess prices at any time, following the established precedents for secondary grades. The committee will have 15 members, nominated as Chen Ziyu, Cai Yukun, Zhou Zhizhen, Zhu Zixiang, and Fu Geng from the Bean and Rice Industry Association; Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, Huang Zhuyuan, Pan Jibin, and Shi Hongdong from the Rice Merchants Association; Zhu Zhaoqi from the Rice Milling Industry Association; Yan Jiyun from the Southern Merchants Association; Shi Zufuk from the Changshu Rice Industry Association; Jiang Shizhi from the United Rice Merchants Association; and Zhang Songtao from the Rice Grain Distribution Industry Association. Fu Geng from the Bean and Rice Industry Association was appointed as the convener, and the committee is scheduled to be established on the 15th of this month at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the first committee meeting will be held. The organization of the committee should be reported to the authorities of the two concessions, and future price assessments should also be reported regularly.

Request to Relax Price Limits Rejected

When various rice industry groups held a joint meeting yesterday, some rice merchants requested a relaxation of the price limits, so the number of people attending was very crowded. It was heard that the decision not to allow a relaxation of the price limits and to assess prices at any time based on the previously agreed price limits was met with dissatisfaction by the general rice merchants. There are still about 600,000 dan of rice in stock in the Shanghai market, so there is no immediate cause for panic about shortages. The rice industry groups, in addition to making every effort to facilitate the supply, will also crack down on hoarding and speculation. Personnel have been dispatched to thoroughly investigate at any time. If manipulative activities are discovered, severe punishment will be imposed.

Patriotic Groups Warn Rice Merchants

According to information obtained by a reporter from the Modern News Agency from the rice industry, due to the soaring rice prices in recent days, off-market transactions have increased significantly. Although the association has made every effort to suppress it, the market situation is still chaotic. However, because it concerns the people's livelihood, all parties attach great importance to it. The Bean and Rice Industry Association suddenly received a warning letter from a patriotic group the day before yesterday, along with a detailed list of the names of companies manipulating the market. The letter hopes that the association will carefully plan regulatory measures to maintain the food supply and crack down on the hoarding and speculation of unscrupulous merchants to monopolize market prices at any time.

### Municipal Council Member of the French Concession, Qi Laidun, Resigns, Succeeded by Ke Xuer

Qi Laidun, a member of the Municipal Council of the French Concession, has resigned and been succeeded by Ke Xuer, a director of the Banque de l'Indochine.

### Labor Bureau Film Inspection Committee Member, He Deman, Resigns

Mr. A. Hartmann, a member of the Film Inspection Committee of the Labor Bureau, has resigned due to his impending departure from Shanghai, and the Bureau has approved his resignation.

### U.S. Navy Stationed in Shanghai Temporarily on Alert in Defense Zone Yesterday, Prevented Japanese Military Police and Any Troops from Entering, Japanese Side Protested to U.S. Military Authorities

Around 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, plainclothes Japanese military police and naval personnel suddenly conducted some work at the residence of Shao Shijun, the "Director of the Puppet Unified Tax Bureau," at No. 39 Nanyang Road, in the U.S. military defense zone. When the U.S. naval authorities learned of this, they considered it an intrusion into the defense zone by the Japanese military police, infringing on sovereignty. At 10:30 a.m., they ordered a truckload of U.S. Marine Corps soldiers stationed in Shanghai to rush to the scene and drive away the Japanese military police, not allowing them to stay. Yesterday morning, the Japanese side again planned to send military police back into the area, but they were again prevented by U.S. troops, and no Japanese military units were allowed to pass through. At the same time, in order to prevent accidents, a temporary alert was announced, and additional U.S. troops were stationed along the road from Mud City Bridge to the area of the extra-settlement roads in western Shanghai. The situation was quite tense. The Japanese side claimed that the Japanese military police's visit to Nanyang Road did not conflict with the U.S. defense force's sovereignty. Being prevented now was considered a deliberate insult, and it was heard that a protest would be filed with the U.S. defense force authorities, threatening to take stern action.

According to another report, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. yesterday, in the central area of the Public Concession, a U.S. small-caliber cannon military truck, equipped with six small-caliber cannons, ammunition boxes, etc., and escorted by about 30 artillerymen, patrolled the area within the defense zone, such as Maizhong Road, West Suzhou Road, Xinzha Road, Qingdao Road, Avenue Road, Baker Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Carter Road, Datong Road, Chengdu Road, and Mei Baker Road. In addition, a squad of infantry, about 20 men, carried light rifles with bayonets and backpacks, and patrolled along the Suzhou River before returning to camp at noon.

### Relaxation on the Outside, Tensions on the Inside: The Seriousness of the Concession Has Not Decreased, U.S. Military Protests to the Labor Bureau Are Untrue, the Japanese Side Continues to Exert Pressure Step by Step

A notice from the Labor Bureau's information office stated that a news item in this morning's newspapers claimed that the recent understanding reached between the Bureau and the Japanese side regarding cooperation in investigating terrorist activities had caused a protest from the U.S. authorities. This news is untrue. During a recent search conducted in the U.S. military defense zone in accordance with the agreed compromise, there was an exceptional act. The U.S. authorities asked the Bureau to pay attention to this exceptional act, stating that it did not comply with the compromise. The Bureau has taken measures to prevent such acts from happening again.

There Are Three Ways the Japanese Exert Pressure

According to foreign sources, the Japanese side is currently exerting pressure on the Labor Bureau in three ways: (1) direct negotiations, (2) exerting pressure on the governments of relevant countries through diplomatic channels, and (3) instigating the "Great Way" municipal government to make continuous demands on the Labor Bureau and the consular body.

It is Reported That Xiao'an Made Requests to the French Consul

Pseudo-Shanghai "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an, recently instigated, in addition to making five unreasonable "requests" to the Public Concession Labor Bureau and the Shanghai consular body the other day, actually made three "requests" to the French Consul-General in Shanghai yesterday. The wording was absurd and bizarre. Excerpts from the "Protest Letter" are as follows: (1) The assassinations that have occurred are actually caused by the authorities of your concession accommodating Kuomintang and Communist rebels, allowing them to move freely within the concession and plot wrongdoing. Please ask the authorities of your concession to cooperate with this municipal government as soon as possible, and be sure to investigate the household registration. If there is evidence of party membership, all will be expelled from the country. Those who secretly possess firearms will be severely punished according to law. The main road intersections on the border between the Chinese territory and the Public Concession should be closely guarded and inspections should be strengthened in order to maintain security and eliminate the source of chaos. (2) The failure of the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court to be taken back under the jurisdiction of this government is also an important reason for the assassinations. This court is under the control and support of the Chongqing party government. Even if the rioters of the same front are arrested, they will never be fully punished according to law. Therefore, this government proposes that the president of the District Court and all prosecutors be replaced and replaced by officials appointed by the new government to comply with the system. (3) The Reorganization Government uses the five-color flag as the national flag. All areas under the control of the Reorganization Government should comply with the flag. However, the flag of the former party government, the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag, is still displayed in your concession area. Therefore, people's hearts are thinking of chaos, and the evil atmosphere of the Kuomintang and Communist parties is growing stronger as a result. The impact on the hearts of the people and the national system is significant. Please prohibit the display of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag from the date of this document. If the prohibition is not added, then the authorities of your concession will be fully responsible for all accidents caused by the flag issue in the future. (Omitted below)

Arresting Chinese and Handing Them Over Directly to the Japanese Side

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, according to news today (the 13th), since the Japanese authorities and the Labor Bureau concluded an agreement, Japanese plainclothes military police have been cooperating with the Public Concession patrolmen and arresting eight Chinese. It is heard that none of these eight people have had cases established with outwardly reliable evidence by the Public Concession security forces before being directly handed over to the Japanese authorities. Four of them were arrested in rooms 225 and 238 of the Mengyuan Hotel on Hubei Road at 9:00 p.m. on the 7th of this month. Another person was arrested at 6:00 p.m. the next day at No. 19, Lane 145, Guling Road. The sixth person was arrested on the 12th of this month at No. 3, Lifu Li, Chengdu Road. And at 7:00 a.m. yesterday, two more people were arrested in room 719 of the Yangtze Hotel on Yunnan Road. What crimes they were accused of has not been revealed. It is heard that although the Public Concession patrolmen assisted in the arrests, the interrogations were only carried out by the Japanese military police.

### Disaster Relief Committee: Wartime Relief, 9 Million Refugees Assisted

In order to facilitate the implementation of wartime disaster relief, the National Government's Disaster Relief Committee divided the area into eight relief zones for management. Each zone has a responsible authority, cooperating with local officials, police, and private relief

groups.

To resolve difficulties and jointly handle regular relief for wartime refugees, special relief during emergencies, and work relief, etc. According to a recent announcement by the committee, it has spent 1.5 million national currency on the above relief, assisting 3.5 million refugees. In addition, refugees have received indirect relief from various provincial governments. The committee sends special commissioners to reside and handle relief work based on the needs of various provinces, or allocates funds to the provincial authorities for distribution.

This Expenditure

Also reached 2 million yuan. Regarding the handling of post-air raid relief, cash is given for the burial of the dead and the treatment of the injured. This expenditure was 357,000 yuan. However, the most difficult thing is the relief work in the war zone. Foreign church groups and international charitable organizations are making great efforts in this work. The total number of people assisted, including those directly receiving cash relief from the committee, is approximately 3.97 million. Those who are

Indirectly Assisted

Through local authorities is 2.83 million. In addition to the above number, it is estimated that there are 3 million refugees who have received assistance from private charitable organizations assisted by the committee. In total, the number of refugees assisted, directly and indirectly, should be more than 9 million. In addition, the committee sent personnel to investigate and distribute relief funds in the occupied areas close to the rear. According to people from Zhejiang Province, the Disaster Relief Committee in the winter of last year, in

Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway

Counties and towns along the line, such as Zhapu, Pinghu, and Haiyan, investigated the situation of refugees for a month. All issues relating to the accommodation, clothing, and food of the refugees were prepared in great detail. After the investigation, funds were allocated to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to be handed over to the special commissioners' offices in various districts for distribution. A total of more than 20,000 yuan was distributed, benefiting many refugees. Relief was also organized at the same time in the area around Shangjiang Fudian.

### Taxpayers Association Asks Labor Bureau to Reconsider Tax Increase, Consumption Prosperity Is Difficult to Sustain, Tax Increase Makes Production Decline

The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Labor Bureau yesterday regarding the Public Concession Labor Bureau Board of Directors' decision to increase the municipal general tax by 2% from October of this year. The letter states: "We are writing to inform you that, according to reports, your Bureau intends to increase the municipal general tax from 16% to 18% and the land tax from 8 per thousand to 9 per thousand from October 18th of the Republic of China, an increase of 1.25% each. This fact has been approved by the Board of Directors. The Association, due to its position, has no choice but to protest this proposal for the following reasons: (1) Regarding the current market, what is the true extent of its prosperity? Based on observations from many aspects, it is superficially prosperous, a prosperity of consumption rather than a prosperity of production, and it cannot be sustained. One of the three major principles of taxation is to promote production. Under these circumstances, increasing taxes will inevitably cause production to decline. (2) Water rises, boats rise; rivers rise, wells rise. This is a very common phenomenon. Public institutions that rely on public finance to maintain themselves are like boats and wells. The demand for real estate in Shanghai has increased rents, not only recovering the amount before the January 28 Incident in the 21st year of the Republic of China, but also greatly increasing it. The income from the municipal general tax and land tax has already followed this increase. However, this increase should be regarded as tidal. Now, in addition to the natural increase in tax revenue, an artificial increase is added, which will only accelerate the retreat of this tidal increase. (3) The prosperity of public institutions is the prosperity of the public. This is an iron law recognized by politicians, especially European and American politicians. The achievements of former British Prime Minister MacDonald and current U.S. President Roosevelt are deeply worthy of emulation. However, senior officials of public institutions have increased their salaries by more than 50% during this difficult period, claiming that it will stabilize their lives and allow them to focus on serving the public. But the taxpayers, who are in a precarious situation, are forced to live an unstable life and unable to focus on their careers due to the increase in taxes. Compared with MacDonald's example of taking the lead in cutting his salary by 1,000 pounds, is there any uneasiness in your hearts? In short, public institutions and the public are inseparable and share weal and woe. It is necessary to have mutual understanding and a spirit of hard work in order to bring about a better future. We hereby write to request that your Bureau reconsider the proposal to increase taxes. We are most grateful."

### Taikoo Company Plans to Increase Ships to Sail the Hong Kong-Burma-Singapore Route, Connecting Yunnan-Burma-Hong Kong Import and Export Cargo Transportation with the Collapsed Burma Air Route and Imperial Airways Route

According to sources in the shipping industry, since the situation in South China changed, maritime transportation between China and Europe and America has gradually shifted from Guangzhou to Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam. The traffic between Hong Kong and Rangoon alone, due to the impact of the war, sees all goods shipped to China from Europe and America, and Chinese native products for export, being directly transported by ships to Hong Kong, and then transshipped to Haiphong and Rangoon, for transfer to Kunming, or transported from Kunming to Hong Kong. Therefore, the Hong Kong-Rangoon transportation line is becoming increasingly close, and the frequency of cargo transportation is unprecedented.

Foreign Merchants Increase Ships Sailing Hong Kong-Burma

Due to the Japanese monopolization of navigation in North China and the Yangtze River, foreign shipping companies have long paid attention to the Hong Kong-Burma route, as the ships that used to sail those routes have been suspended. In particular, British shipping companies, such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, whose ships have been suspended in North China and the Yangtze River, are now planning to increase and add ships to sail this route. As for other inland river shipping companies in Hong Kong and China, they are also rising to compete in order to develop their own businesses, and are determined to take the opportunity to sail the Hong Kong-Burma line. According to sources from Taikoo, the company is currently considering increasing the number of ships sailing this route, and it will be implemented as soon as the plan is completed, and it will be managed by the Hong Kong company.

Fallen Burma Air Route Implements Connection

According to a report from a Modern News Agency reporter stationed in Hong Kong, the China-Burma air route (flying between Chongqing and Rangoon) was launched from the fallen [area] on the 28th of last month. The aircraft used was a Douglas DC2, flown by Captain Shabi. In the future, there will be two flights per week, connected with Imperial Airways flights. It is noted that the route of the China-Burma flights follows the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Imperial Airways has already built a radio station and a temporary airport, and its public facilities have also been completed. China National Aviation Corporation has ordered two newly manufactured DC3 aircraft from the United States, worth US$250,000. These new aircraft, which can carry 24 people, will arrive in Hong Kong at the end of this summer, and their maximum speed is 230 miles per hour.

### Restrictions on Displacement of Vessels Sailing to Ningbo: Notification from Jianghai Customs to Zhejiang Customs

Jianghai Customs received a notice from Zhejiang Customs regarding the re-implementation of restrictions on vessels sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo. The displacement restrictions are as follows: for steamships entering the Zhenhai port, those with a displacement of 15 to 16 feet are allowed to enter at low tide, and those with a displacement of 16 to 17 feet are allowed to enter at high tide. The length restrictions of the vessels will be handled in accordance with the previously promulgated regulations.

### Fallen Area Flooded with Japanese Goods; Imports Jump to First Place; Attempt to Dominate Trade in China, Interests of All Countries Plundered

Japan is attempting to dominate trade in China after the war, with massive imports of Japanese goods being dumped in its occupied areas. The goods of the United Kingdom and the United States are affected. Procurement of native products must be authorized by Japanese procurement certificates. Major native products are controlled and shipped to Japan by ship. The details are as follows:

Japan Dominates Trade in China

Japan is attempting to dominate trade in China by restricting the import of goods from third countries in its occupied areas, replacing the position of foreign businesses in its occupied areas with Japanese industries, and importing and dumping large quantities of Japanese goods. In addition, it refuses to open the Yangtze River and hinders navigation by third countries, resulting in Japanese goods flooding its occupied areas and the almost complete disappearance of British and American goods. Major native products, such as cotton, grains, leather, and wool, are purchased by large-scale companies and shipped to Japan to be used as raw materials. If merchants from third countries wish to purchase them, they must obtain approval from Japan and receive a procurement certificate. As a result, trade in China by the United Kingdom and the United States is greatly affected.

Dumping of Japanese Goods Causes Sharp Increase in Imports

Since August of last year, imports of Japanese goods have increased sharply, implementing its dumping policy. Imports in August were 23,825,000 yuan, in September they were 24,757,000 yuan, in October they were 20,625,000 yuan, in November they were 32,467,000 yuan, in December they were 27,574,000 yuan, and in January of this year they were 26,710,000 yuan. In each of the above months, imports of Japanese goods ranked first. The goods are mostly cotton cloth, rayon, machinery, hardware, seafood products, daily necessities, sugar, wine, books, maps, wooden paper products, wood, stone, soil, and groceries.

The United Kingdom and the United States are Affected

Before the war and at the beginning of the war, the United States ranked first in import trade to China, followed by Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Since August of last year, imports of Japanese goods have jumped to first place, the United States has fallen to second place, and the United Kingdom, Germany, France, etc., have gradually faded. This proves that the trade of various countries with China has been greatly affected by the dumping of Japanese goods and the restriction of imports of goods from third countries, causing greater damage to the interests of merchants from third countries in China than in any previous era. Therefore, merchants from various countries believe that if sanctions are not imposed, merchants from third countries in the Japanese-occupied areas will be unable to continue operating. Fortunately, foreign goods are still sold as usual in non-occupied areas.

### Relief Association Withdraws 100,000 Yuan to Prepare a Fund

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association recently hosted some of the heads of the shelters, where the association's Deputy Secretary-General and Director of Aftercare Wei Bozhen, Deputy Directors Li Wenjie and Chen Xianmo, and Secretary Li Baiqiang, explained the importance of aftercare work. Representatives from each shelter expressed their opinions and discussed them in detail. It is reported that the association's board of directors has resolved to withdraw 100,000 yuan to be used as an aftercare equipment fund, and will also hold a fundraising for a refugee production education fund to actively promote refugee production work and turn dividends into profits.

Clothing Industry: Since the establishment of the Fundraising Committee of the Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group, industry associations have enthusiastically supported it to facilitate relief efforts. The Clothing Industry Association has raised 1,182 yuan from all its members, including Wang Xingchang, Xinfeng, and Hechang, and reported to the association, which transferred it to the Relief Association yesterday.

Soy Sauce and Wine Industry: The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Soy Sauce and Wine Industry held a fundraising committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at No. 10 Zhenhou Lane, Xiamen Road, to discuss active fundraising methods. More than ten committee members, including Chen Zhenlin, Zhang Lianyuan, Zhang Jiefu, and Hu Benxin, attended. After discussion, it was resolved: (1) to add Yu Rupin and Chen Zhenlin as standing committee members to supervise and promote the fundraising work; (2) to continue to hire Wan Tai's Yu Weiliang, Wan Mao's Gu Weiqin, Yu Yuan's Chao Zhimei, Li Xing's Ye Huiqin, Wan Zhen's Pan Yunbo, Ding Shun's Cai Langfu, Wan He Shun's Cao Guo, Lao Tong Yu's Dong Yaoshan, Xin Wan Kang's Gao Peide, Lao Wan Shen's Cheng Chenfu, Zi Da Chang's Ni Yangzhou, Fuxing's Sun Wu, and Wan Yuan Shun's Shi Youqing as sponsoring committee members to assist in soliciting donations from their respective industries, in order to raise more funds than expected for refugee relief.

### Shanghai Rickshaw Association Urges Wheel Modification, Introduces Vehicle Dealers for Loan Installation Fees Due to Inability to Afford Modification Costs

The Shanghai Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association held a meeting of its standing directors yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Shen Yong, Ke Huaxin, and Ge Futian. Shen Yong chaired the meeting, and the following matters were resolved: (1) Starting from the 16th of this month, members will be dispatched to investigate member vehicles and urge the modification of 2-inch wide iron edges; (2) For members who are unable to afford the cost of modifying iron wheels, the association will introduce vehicle dealers to provide loan installation fees; (3) Members are notified to prepare to modify their wheels and must complete the modification before the deadline of July 1; (4) Continue to handle member registration, compile a member roster, and submit it to the Public Works Department for record; (5) A joint meeting of directors and supervisors will be held on the 19th of this month.

### Commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death: French Concession Forbids Displaying Flags, Considers County Flags to Have "Political Nature" and Should Be Intervened with According to French Concession Regulations

The Continental Daily News reported that although personnel of the Public Concession did not interfere with the display of the Chinese national flag yesterday (the 12th) to commemorate the 14th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the municipal authorities of the French Concession did not allow the display of the Chinese national flag. A senior official of the French Concession Municipal Council told reporters that the French Concession has regulations regarding the display of flags, but the official explained that the French Concession only interferes with the display of Chinese flags related to "political activities." In view of the declaration issued by the Kuomintang Party Headquarters in this city urging the people of Shanghai to display flags as part of the commemorative ceremony, the display of Chinese flags this time is purely "political." It was heard yesterday afternoon that French Concession police entered Chinese houses and ordered the removal of national flags in several cases. The police entered a house near the Great World and ordered the owner to remove the flag, which aroused a considerable number of onlookers.

### Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week: Today is Farmers' Propaganda Day; Participate in Guerrilla Warfare, Strive for Agricultural Affairs, and Vigorously Implement the National Spiritual Mobilization

Today is the Farmers' Propaganda Day of the Second Anti-Japanese War's First Propaganda Week in Shanghai. Shanghai farmers' organizations have issued a letter to all fellow farmers in the city. The full text is as follows: Dear fellow farmers in the city, the farmers of China are the most revolutionary. Throughout history, those who rebelled against oppression and raised the banner of uprising were mostly farmers. In China's anti-Japanese war, farmers are of course a main force. Look at the soldiers currently fighting on the front lines, most of them come from the fields, and the continuous replenishment also comes from the peasant masses. In the later stages of the anti-Japanese war, in terms of troop replenishment, farmers are the main body. In terms of the occupied areas, farmers are the only basic force for recovering lost territories. The four-month bloody battle of Shanghai two years ago aroused the enthusiasm of farmers in the city to resist Japan and save the country. Everyone dropped their hoes, either joining the army and splattering the enemy with their blood, or organizing battlefield service teams to transport weapons, military rations, intelligence, and build defense works. Even ordinary women automatically took on the cooking and comforting tasks for the army. The enemy's artillery fire can destroy our fields, but it cannot destroy our determination to resist Japan. On the contrary, the more intense the enemy's artillery fire, the higher our anti-enemy sentiment. Although Shanghai has fallen, our farmer friends have always guarded the inch of land left by our ancestors and fought the most arduous and heroic struggle. However, upon careful review, although past efforts have achieved considerable results, they are still not enough. It must be known that at this critical moment of national life and death, the contributions of the people of the whole country to the country should exceed all historical precedents. On the negative side, we should endure all the hardships that ordinary people cannot endure. On the positive side, we should unleash our highest degree of potential strength and deal with the enemy to the end. Now, I list five things as the common goals of our farmer compatriots at present: 1. Participate in guerrilla warfare. From one village to one town, to one township and one county, all adults should be gathered together to form guerrilla teams. The tasks of the guerrilla team are approximately four points: (1) ambush the enemy; (2) eliminate traitors; (3) protect production and its circulation; (4) strengthen political training. 2. Engage in production. Farmers in guerrilla areas, except those who are not controlled by the enemy, must not abandon farming in addition to guerrilla work, in order to maintain the supply for long-term operations. 3. Non-cooperation movement. We should adopt non-cooperation in the economic sphere with enemies and traitors: (1) refuse to use counterfeit currency; (2) refuse to pay taxes; (3) absolutely do not provide the enemy with manpower or material resources; (4) refuse the penetration of enemy goods into the guerrilla area. 4. Follow government orders. Farmers should absolutely follow the orders of the administrative organs established by the government in the guerrilla area in order to consolidate the strength of the anti-Japanese war and national construction. 5. Vigorously implement the National Spiritual Mobilization. The National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and its implementation measures recently promulgated by Chairman Chiang should be earnestly followed in order to achieve the highest goal of national construction based on the Three People's Principles. The above five points are all urgent tasks for our farmer friends today. In order to defend our homeland, in order to strive for the independence, freedom, equality, and peace of our country and nation, we must follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and vow to fight the enemy to the death. Shanghai is the enemy's rear headquarters. We will not only not allow him to control it, but also fundamentally take it back.

### Postal Workers Host Press, Report Transfer Process

Sixty-five postal workers from the Shanghai Post Office who were transferred to the southwest hosted a tea reception for the press yesterday, reporting the truth about this unfair transfer and the negotiations of the transferred postal workers. (According to the postal regulations, Class B postal workers are not transferred out of the postal area, so the transferred workers requested to be used as reserves, and after the war, they would return to serve in the Shanghai postal area.) They called on the media to provide assistance and stated that Chinese employees were being transferred and Japanese employees were being employed (the recently employed Japanese employees were not tested and were called non-ranked postal workers, with a monthly salary of 262.5 yuan), which caused a serious crisis in the postal service. Representatives from the press delivered speeches, praising the postal workers' enthusiasm for serving the country, and promised to do their best to support the postal workers' negotiations in order to achieve a reasonable solution.

### Leaders of Northern Jiangsu Guerrilla Force, Qu Du and Wang Jin, Martyred; Murdered by Someone, Public Mourns and Friends Hold Memorial Service

According to visitors from Northern Jiangsu, Qu Du and Wang Jin, leaders of the guerrilla war in Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, and Chongming counties, were unfortunately assassinated on January 10 of this year in Hexing Town, Qidong, by Zhang Nengren, the former commander of the [blank] detachment stationed in the town. Their bodies were abandoned in the fields, and later collected by the martyrs' families. At that time, the people of Qidong and Haimen mourned over the bodies, and those who mourned numbered no less than 20,000 to 30,000.

Since the successive fall of Tong, Hai, Chong, and Qi in March and April of last year, the people have suffered greatly. Commander Qu Du immediately destroyed his family and started an uprising in his native Chongming, and began to organize guerrilla troops. In the Battle of Shituo Port, he gave the enemy its first defeat. Martyr Wang Jin was originally studying at [blank] University in Shanghai. In the autumn of last year, he joined the troops of Martyr Qu and engaged in organizing the people and developing guerrilla warfare. He fought five battles against the Japanese army and captured many prisoners, repeatedly making outstanding achievements. He swept away the public's fear of Japan, and recovered the county seat of Qidong. The military and civilians were in harmony, and the people of Northern Jiangsu spoke highly of him. As a result, the two-faced elements in the area harbored great jealousy, leading to the incident on January 10, which killed our national hero. Everyone lamented his death.

Also, the friends of Martyrs Qu and Wang held a memorial service yesterday, attended by more than 200 guests. The white cars and horses showed the extreme grief of the moment. It was also heard that the friends of Martyrs Qu and Wang organized a Qu and Wang Martyrs Memorial Committee for the sake of permanent commemoration. At that time, the memorial methods were determined, such as: (1) sending representatives to comfort the martyrs' families; (2) compiling a commemorative album of Qu and Wang Martyrs and arranging their posthumous works; (3) developing the undertakings operated by Qu and Wang Martyrs during their lifetime; (4) preparing scholarships; (5) the problem of the tombs of the two martyrs.

### Ningbo Garrison Command Forbids the Export of Able-Bodied Men

According to Ningbo News, since the headquarters of the 3rd Army Group issued the Provisional Navigation Measures for Eastern Zhejiang, the Shanghai-Ningbo line has resumed direct navigation. There are special provisions for passengers entering and exiting, and they must hold travel permits. Able-bodied men of the right age are strictly prohibited from exporting. If it is necessary to export due to important matters, the travel permit may also be given at discretion after the county government of the original place of origin has verified the authenticity. However, two wealthy shops with more than 2,000 yuan must be guaranteed to guarantee their return to their place of origin for conscription within a limited period of time. If there is an intention to escape conscription and affect government affairs, it is not a simple matter. The Ningbo Garrison Command Inspection Office, which is now responsible for inspecting the ports, has issued a notice that any able-bodied men who have not obtained a certificate and try to export in a muddled way will be sent to the military service immediately upon discovery, whether or not they are selected for military service, as a warning and to deter others from following suit.

### First Special City Federation Discusses Important Cases, Reports Rice Merchants for Manipulation, Asks for Exemption from Municipal Tax

The Shanghai First Special District Citizen Federation held its 103rd Executive Committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Association Building on Jiangxi Road. Zhang Yi'ao chaired the meeting, and the following matters were resolved: (1) The price of rice in the city has recently risen to the limited price and seems to continue to rise, which is a matter of people's food. A solution should be sought quickly. It was resolved: 1. Send a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Industry Association to earnestly implement the resolution to maintain the limited price. 2. Notify the district branches to investigate the rice sales situation in their respective areas. 3. Welcome citizens to report unscrupulous merchants who hoard and manipulate, or raise prices. 4. Send a letter to the authorities of the two concessions to properly plan the welfare policy of rice for the citizens and make preparations in advance. (2) At the time of emergency, all industries and businesses are strong on the outside but weak on the inside. Citizens should be advised to work hard in production and practice thrift. Resolved, passed. (3) The Public Concession Public Works Department decided to increase the municipal general tax by 2% starting from October 1 of this year. Resolved: the municipal general tax of the Public Concession has already been increased once after the war, that is, from the tax rate of 14% to 16%. Now, the tax is increased by 2%, that is, the tax rate is increased to 18%. In view of the economic situation after the war, it is really unbearable. The Public Works Department should be asked to consider the current difficulties and withdraw the proposed increase in tax, and the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession should be asked to strive for negotiation. (4) The association previously considered that housing rent disputes within the boundary were quite serious, and organized a Residence Problem Committee to conduct mediation. Since the handling, it has been quite effective. Now, this type of dispute has been significantly reduced. In order to save expenses, it is proposed to end the Residence Problem Committee. Resolved, the Residence Problem Committee is approved to end its operations from today. If there are housing rent disputes between members in the future, the association will handle them directly. (5) The association intends to hold a citizen's group wedding to promote thrift in marriage. Resolved, passed.

### Delivering Mail Must Recognize Sections; Of the Postal Branches, About Sixteen Districts Are Open; Eleven Districts Not Yet Restored

Since the outbreak of the August 13th incident, some of the postal branches in the city, such as Hongkou, Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong, were forced to stop working, and were moved to the General Post Office on North Suzhou Road. Because the public is not familiar with the situation of each postal branch, they often deliver mail to areas that are not open for mail delivery, causing proper mail to be delayed or lost. In the future, when delivering mail, the sections must be identified. The open and unopened areas of each district postal office are listed as follows: About sixteen districts are open, including Jilu Road, Ximen, Lan Ni Du, Jing'an Temple, Cade Road, Xujiahui, Kandi Road, Roberts Road, Jiangxi Road, North Railway Station, Seymour Road, City Center Area, Bailinan Road, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, and Dong Youheng Road. About eleven districts have not resumed postal delivery, including Nanshi Bund, Li Ma Road, Da Nanmen, Longhua, Gaochang Temple, Zhongshan Road, Lao Bei Men, Sichuan Road, West Huade Road, Zhabei, and Baoding Road. Each branch has detailed regulations for the time of sending and receiving letters. However, those who send letters at the branch must do so earlier so that the time of sending and receiving corresponds to that of the General Post Office.

### Various Industry Associations Notify Members to Check Books and Records and Affix Stamps According to Law; Penalties Increased During Extraordinary Times; Failure to Affix Four Cents Results in a Penalty of Twenty-Four Yuan

Yesterday, various industry associations in the city notified their affiliated stores, companies, and factories, saying, "Dear sirs, regarding the use of stamp tax tickets by businesses in the city, since the intermediate shutdown and subsequent resumption, it seems that they have not paid as much attention as before, resulting in many cases where stamps should have been affixed but were not. The mistake lies in the fact that some merchants believe that there have been no penalties for stamp cases in the city for a long time, and they are inevitably taking it lightly. If this kind of erroneous psychology is not corrected, the result of negligence and failure to affix stamps will inevitably lead to losses due to penalties. Moreover, during extraordinary times, the penalty method for failure to affix stamp tax tickets is more severe than usual. For example, each account book should now be affixed with four cents. If it is not affixed, it will be punished at 60 times the rate, so each book should be fined 24 yuan. If there are multiple account books that are not affixed, and the penalties are combined, it should not exceed the maximum amount of six times, which can result in a combined penalty of up to 144 yuan. This is a very painful experience for small businesses. The association specially informs all businesses that for all books and records established before today, if there are any unattached or insufficiently attached stamps, they should immediately check and attach them one by one. For documents that have been issued, if they can still be recovered for attachment, it is also best to attach them. From now on, all kinds of account books and documents should be carefully checked at any time to purchase and attach the correct number of stamps. If it comes to the time of punishment, then even if you want to complete it by affixing the stamps, you will not be able to do so."

### Fu Xiao'an Still Trying to Cling to His Position, Asks for a Delay in Change on the Pretext of Debts Owed to Public Funds

Since Fu Xiao'an took office as "Mayor" five months ago, the wind of corruption has become rampant, arousing dissatisfaction from Japanese special agencies, which intend to remove him and promote Su Xiwen, the current pseudo-"Secretary-General," to take his place. However, after the news was revealed, several people, including Chen Yi, the former pseudo-"Commissioner of the Government," Lu Ying, the current pseudo-"Police Chief," and Wu Wenzhong, the pseudo-"Director of the Social Affairs Bureau" and the pseudo-"Director of the Judiciary Office," also sought to curry favor for this puppet position, and have been very active in lobbying the Japanese special agencies and the pseudo-"Reformed Government" in Nanjing. While various parties were participating in the competition, it was suddenly discovered that Chuan Xiao had misappropriated as much as tens of thousands of gold from the pseudo-"Public Funds," which was difficult to turn over. As a result, an unexpected problem arose. If Fu stepped down, the misappropriated funds would be difficult to recover, and Su Xiwen also insisted that he would not rashly take over unless Fu returned all of the pseudo-"Public Funds." In desperation, Fu Xiao'an took a car to Ningbo on the 4th of this month and begged Liang Hongzhi and others to help him maintain his pseudo-position. He would repay the pseudo-"Public Funds" he owed month by month, with the clear intention of not leaving the pseudo-position or repaying the debts. Liang and others also felt difficult to cope with and had no choice but to intercede with the Japanese special agencies, on the pretext that the pseudo-"Diplomatic" situation was tense and senior puppets should not be transferred. On the one hand, Fu was ordered to stay in the pseudo-position and quickly repay the debts to clear the accounts before proceeding with the replacement. It is heard that the Japanese side is temporarily accepting the intention of the pseudo-"Renovation," so Fu Xiao'an's pseudo-position may still be retained for three or four months, while Su Chen Lu Wu and others failed to win the game. It is also learned that the pseudo-"Municipal Government" added a pseudo-"Foreign Affairs Section" on the pretext of terrorist incidents to handle pseudo-"Diplomacy," and newly appointed Chen Gongzhan and Gu Damin, two traitors, to jointly handle it.

### Management of the Clearing House, Discount on Wire Transfer Bills, Preventing Speculators from Monopolizing Profits

After the implementation of the new wire transfer bill system after the war, ordinary speculative merchants were actually handling discounts, attempting to make huge profits, so that the discount rate once rose to 70 yuan. Later, the bank clearing house came forward to maintain it and gradually stabilized after large-scale transfers. Since January of this year, after the exchange officially announced the buying and selling market every day and formally managed it, the discount rate has stabilized. Now the office has decided to continue to manage it to prevent monopolistic profiteering by speculators.

### The Reasons for and Remedies for Marital Tragedy

A monogamous marriage is the best family system in civilized society. A couple, both strong and healthy, each fulfilling their functions, the man plowing and the woman weaving in rural society, or the man going out to manage business or industry and the woman managing the household in urban society, with marital love that is considerate and tender, and children born lively and intelligent, this is naturally a harmonious and healthy family. This kind of healthy family, not only do the husband and wife enjoy happiness and well-being, but it is also a good and stable foundation for society, and is of great importance to the nation and the country. According to our physiological and psychological research, a couple, each united as husband and wife due to their physiological needs, should live in harmony, with deep love, enjoying a life of bliss, so why does tragedy occur in the family?

Although there are many reasons for family tragedies, apart from men being too greedy, taking a concubine in addition to a wife, or secretly keeping a mistress, there is the saying, "If you want your family to be disharmonious, take a concubine." In addition to the chaos of having too many women, the most common cause is the decline of male virility. According to our research on female psychology, unless she does not marry him, if she marries him, she will give him her entire body and mind. As long as he can give her sufficient joy and comfort, she will feel that he is the only one in her life who understands her, hence the saying, "A devoted woman loves a heartless man," women are mostly devoted. However, if a man commits self-abuse and nocturnal emissions in his early years, or indulges in debauchery after marriage, leading to depletion of essence and blood, resulting in morbidity in sexual function, and in the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, he often feels headache and brain pain, forgetfulness and insomnia, tinnitus and blurred vision, restlessness, back pain, and fatigue, etc. In marital life, how can such a man receive his wife's passion? Passion being deceived is a heart-wrenching thing! If she is sacrificed for a long time, how can she not become angry and ashamed! Leading to all kinds of tragedies in the family! In today's society, it is often heard that wives have relationships with others, or openly confront their husbands in court, righteously suing for divorce. When a husband suffers such a tragedy, can one not shed tears if one puts oneself in his shoes and imagines the pain in his heart? At the same time, due to physical weakness, how can he withstand such severe stimulation? If he is excessively worried and sad, he may become prematurely senile or even die young!

However, we know that for intelligent men, the above-mentioned symptoms are not incurable. If treated symptomatically, health can be restored. According to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, it is generally recognized that taking the male hormone preparation "Reproductive Element" is the most effective treatment. This preparation can generate sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within one day and night after taking it. If taken continuously, it can completely cure the above-mentioned symptoms. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Hymeto Spermatostasis Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage, which will yield even faster results.

### Nocturnal Emission is the Most Harmful Disease

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng

Because semen is the source of our lives, nocturnal emission is the most harmful disease. Now, let us analyze it in the following aspects: The semen in a person's body is extracted from the most valuable nutrients in food, and then produced by the testicles and flowed into the seminal vesicles through various wonderful physical and chemical actions in physiology. If the flow is too much, it will indeed show excessive sperm discharge. Approximately healthy, unmarried, and adult men have it once or twice a month. This is physiological and cannot be considered pathological. However, many people engage in masturbation due to sperm overflow, or develop pathological nocturnal emission due to masturbation or other mental fantasies, which should be carefully prevented. In short, unless it is physiological sperm overflow and legitimate sexual intercourse after marriage (but one must not be licentious, as licentiousness also has various drawbacks), if semen can be richly retained in the body, it is of great benefit to the body. Because it functions to regulate metabolism, promote development, nourish nerves, and strengthen the brain and kidneys to enhance energy. If a young person has nocturnal emission, or if nocturnal emission deteriorates into spermatorrhea, the semen in the body cannot be stored, and the essence will be depleted and the blood will be exhausted. Therefore, metabolism will be reduced, and in the various tissues of the body, only old cells die and very few new cells are produced, resulting in a sallow complexion and emaciation, and reduced vitality. If this continues, one may become prematurely senile, and development may be hindered, resulting in a short stature and small genitals, like a child. In addition, in the brain, spinal cord, and three major nerves related to sex, there will also be symptoms of weakness, often with poor brainpower, forgetfulness and insomnia, tinnitus and blurred vision, back pain, and fatigue. Kidney deficiency leads to impotence and scattered energy. Moreover, the constant leakage of semen cannot be produced physiologically, resulting in a lack of sperm in the semen, or even none at all, leading to infertility... From all of this, we can know that nocturnal emission is not only harmful to the body, but also leads to infertility, how dangerous it is! As for sexual weakness, which makes marital life unsatisfactory, it will create the most miserable tragedy in life! According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the only treatment for this disease is to take "Hymeto Spermatostasis Tablets," which is the most effective. After taking it, it can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, eliminate evil thoughts, and nocturnal emission can be eradicated immediately. However, if nocturnal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, one must also take the hormone preparation "Reproductive Element" to supplement the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, regulate metabolism, and promote development. If taken continuously, one can completely restore health as soon as possible.

Beauty and Health

### Look! How Important are the Breasts

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Actually Controls a Woman's Life and Fate

"No matter how good a peony is, it all depends on the support of the green leaves." No matter how beautiful a woman is, if she does not have a pair of towering breasts and plump hips to fully reveal her curvy beauty, then even if you wear a splendid embroidered robe (cheongsam), wear precious ornaments, leather shoes and silk stockings, and apply lipstick and eyebrow makeup, it will still feel incomplete, just like a peony without green leaves. Not only in social situations, can you not look around proudly and show your health and beauty, and be secretly ridiculed, but also in the private life between husband and wife, ask yourself what your feelings will be when a flat and boundless strange appearance first catches your husband's eyes? What will your husband's feelings be? I know that even if your husband doesn't say it to your face, his love for you will gradually cool down, or he may even go out and sing and dance, and stay with prostitutes. Although you are very unhappy, you can only suffer in your heart and be depressed because you think of your own shortcomings. Not only that, but as a result of breast atrophy, the function of the ovaries, which is related to the entire health of women, will inevitably be impaired, and the metabolic power will also lose its alternating effect. As a result, irregular menstruation, sticky leukorrhea, cold uterus and infertility, and weakened libido will inevitably follow, leading to difficult childbirth and never having a child in one's life. Even if you have millions of assets, you can only hand them over to others. Thinking of this, the breasts are really of great importance to a woman's happiness.

Then, is there really no way to make up for this kind of defect? That's not the case. According to the unanimous opinion of world-renowned physiologist and beauty expert Kantelin and gynecologist Tang Posheng, if a woman suffers from breast atrophy, small buttocks, irregular menstruation, excessive leukorrhea and infertility, and weakened libido, she can take the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductive Element" invented by Austrian Dr. Standard, which is the most effective treatment. This preparation extracts the essence of healthy animal ovaries and is scientifically refined. Just imagine: supplementing the impaired ovarian function of women with the essence of healthy animal ovaries, it is no wonder that it can exert great medicinal power within one day and night after taking it, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leukorrhea. If you continue to take it, it can gradually make atrophied breasts tower and slender buttocks become plump, and it can also increase blood circulation, allowing white skin to reveal a bright red glow from moisturized and fair flesh.

### What is the Easiest Way to Completely Cure Gonorrhea

It is generally known that gonorrhea is difficult to treat, but in fact, it is also a disease that is easy to treat. The symptoms of gonorrhea are intricate and varied, and the methods for treating gonorrhea are also different, both old and new. Old doctors have never seen what gonorrhea is, so naturally they cannot talk about any treatment methods. However, even general new doctors often find gonorrhea difficult to handle. In fact, it is not the case. Gonorrhea is easy to treat in its early stages, but if the disease is not deep and the treatment method is not appropriate, then this easy-to-treat acute gonorrhea will inevitably become chronic gonorrhea. How many people in the world suffer from chronic gonorrhea, and all of them have gone through acute gonorrhea. Therefore, it is not appropriate to say that acute gonorrhea is easy to treat. However, it is not appropriate to say that chronic gonorrhea is difficult to treat in general. In the past ten years, I have cured no less than several thousand people with chronic gonorrhea. If it is difficult to treat, how can I have so many confirmed cures, and many have been proven by the Public Works Department Health Bureau to be free of gonococcus and have never relapsed. In short, the treatment of acute and chronic leukorrhea, if the diagnosis is accurate and the treatment method is correct, are all easily treatable venereal diseases.

Now, let me take acute prostatitis and urethral stricture in chronic gonorrhea as examples. Acute prostatitis. After accurate diagnosis, a specially made autologous vaccine can be injected, and cooling or warming methods such as anal cooling or enema and suppository methods can be used depending on the symptoms. Acute prostatitis swelling can be reduced within one or two days. For gonococcal stricture, the new-style Davies' device can be used for painless urethral dilation. If the bladder has residual urine retention and is full and about to burst, surgery can be performed quickly to drain the urine to prevent uremia. At this time, it all depends on the doctor's quick hands and eyes, so that the extremely dangerous gonorrhea can be cured in a very short period of time. For these symptoms, flat-flow electrolytic therapy is particularly effective in terms of electrotherapy. For all acute and chronic gonorrhea, if general mediocre treatments and doctors with limited knowledge are used, a cure cannot be obtained in a short period of time.

Specialty: Also treats syphilis, bubo, chancre, and painless new method circumcision.

### Li Pinquan, Shareholder of a Gambling Den, Suspected of Murder

The case of Li Xing's thugs beating Chinese police officers continued to be heard yesterday, with a verdict to be announced on the 17th

Four shooting incidents in western Shanghai were related to Li

Li Pinquan, a native of Nanjing and shareholder of the Guangsheng Company gambling den on Bailinan Road in western Shanghai, saw a rickshaw parked on the side of the road outside the alley of the gambling den on the 14th of last month. Believing that it was obstructing the entry and exit of gamblers, he used his power to bully the rickshaw puller. At that time, Chinese police officer No. 2549 of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who was on patrol, saw the gang causing trouble along the way and went to stop them. Unexpectedly, Li relied on his special influence to order the bodyguards of the gambling den, who are known as "leg huggers," and his thug Wu Xiufeng, a native of Jiangbei, to forcibly drag the police officer into the nearby alley, which was beyond the jurisdiction of the Concession police, and

indulge in violence.

Fortunately, the police officer immediately fired a shot in self-defense. Neighboring officers heard the sound and rushed to the scene, and together they arrested Li and Wu and sent them to the First Special District Local Court for trial. Because the police station believed that Li had committed other crimes and needed to be investigated, they ordered him to be detained pending further investigation. It has been reported in previous reports that the police station has now found that a murder case did occur on October 9 of last year, and the location was in the countryside of "Luxizhai" in the former Shanghai Police Bureau's Sixth District of western Shanghai, which is close to Bailinan Road in the Public Concession.

Shot to death

were named Zhu Laowu and a Mr. Chen, and Lu Xiaoquan was also injured by stray bullets. The cause of the case seemed to be a vendetta. Li Pinquan (also known as Li Wu) and Zhu Laowu had always been on good terms. During the chaos of the Shanghai war, they used extraordinary means to seize a large amount of bamboo, which was sold for a considerable profit. Li received several thousand gold dollars in stolen money, but since then, he and Zhu had a deep grudge. Later, Zhu and Chen both joined the "Tax Agency" of the puppet organization and served as "boat tax" collectors, extorting money from boat households on the west end of the Suzhou River. On that day, Zhu and Chen, together with one

Fang Haiqing

, scraped up "donation" money from the boat households and returned home with full pockets to pay tribute to their "master." When passing Luxizhai, four thugs suddenly emerged and shot at Zhu and Chen, killing them on the spot. Lu happened to be passing by and was caught in the crossfire. A few days ago, the police station sent detectives to summon Lu Xiaoquan, who had recovered from his injuries, and another passerby, Chen Bangda, to the police station to investigate the situation at that time. Lu said that he was injured by stray bullets on that day and did not know who the murderer was. Chen said that he heard gunshots and immediately ran away, so he also did not know

who the murderer was

Later, the detective found Fang Haiqing and, after detailed interrogation, Fang confessed that he had a considerable relationship with both Li and Zhu. When Li obtained the stolen bamboo material money, he was also given ten yuan by Li as the price for keeping the matter a secret. On that day, he was traveling with Zhu and Chen, etc. When he heard gunshots and looked back, Zhu and Chen had already been killed and fallen to the ground. At that time, Li Wu (that is, Li Pinquan) was indeed at the scene, and one of the four murderers was Li Wu's son, etc. The police station then gave the shell casings obtained in the case to

precise examination

and determined that the weapons used in the four shooting incidents that occurred successively on Kainar Road, Robertsen Road, and Jessfield Road were all the same as the murder weapon used to kill Zhu, etc. However, Li Pinquan repeatedly denied it after repeated questioning by the police station, and stated that his son was only eighteen years old and still in school. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo ordered Li and Wu to be brought to court for continued trial. Police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the reason for the previous request for postponement was to investigate the other case committed by Li, and now it has been found that he shot and killed

Zhu and Chen

and injured Lu Xiaoquan. However, the police station does not intend to proceed with the case at this time, so today it will only try the two defendants for the assault on the police officer. The violence that the defendants inflicted on the police officer at that time, if no other police officers had heard the alarm and rushed to help, then the police officer would have been forcibly dragged into the alley, causing a terrible aftermath. Li provided all the cars to the Guangsheng Company gambling den as a means of picking up and dropping off gamblers, and Wu was in charge of

gambling den bodyguards

It is difficult to allow them to evade responsibility and they should be severely punished together. The court immediately conducted a thorough investigation of Li and Wu regarding the alleged assault on the police officer, and their defense lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang made their final arguments. Judge Dai then announced that the verdict would be announced on the morning of the 17th of this month, and Li and the other two were ordered to be returned to the police station for detention.

### A Huge Amount of Opium Hidden in "Angelica Dahurica and Poria Cocos" Medicine Packages Sent from Yunnan Was Seized After Being Opened and Sold in Shanghai

Police officer No. 278 of the Shanghai Municipal Police Force's Search Team, and Chinese police officers No. 85 and No. 965, searched pedestrians and vehicles with suspicious movements on Weihaiwei Road near Tongfu Road at around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 12th). At that time, a No. 18269 silver motor car, driven by driver Huan Chang, arrived at the scene and was stopped for a search. The passengers in the car were four men and one girl.

Fifty packets of opium

were found in the car, each weighing about two taels. The passengers and opium were taken to the police station for investigation. Interrogated, they were named Li Chonggao (30 years old, from Hubei, living on the third floor of No. 9, Lane 455, Hankou Road), Wang Zhengqing (26 years old, living at No. 13, Jingqinfang, Guangdong Road), Luo Yisu (31 years old, from Wuxi), Hu Wenda (26 years old, from Shanghai), and the girl was named Er Nv (10 years old), the daughter of Luo Yisu. She was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. According to Li's confession, another 120 packets of opium were found at his residence, as well as large packets of medicinal materials.

Nineteen pieces of mail

Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Li Chonggao was prosecuted for the crime of selling opium under Article 5 of the Anti-Opium Regulations, and the other three defendants were prosecuted for the crime of helping to sell opium. Judge Xiao Peishen ascended the seat to interrogate. Defendant Li Chonggao confessed that he originally did not do this business, because his friend Chen Zili wrote a letter to him from Yunnan, saying that a large batch of opium was hidden in

Chinese medicine Angelica Dahurica and Poria Cocos

packed and sent to me to sell on consignment. A few days after receiving the letter, the goods also arrived in Shanghai. On the 9th of this month, I went to the post office and transported all nineteen packages he sent to my home. He wrote in the letter that there was no opium in the odd-numbered mail numbers. The opium was hidden in the even-numbered packages. When I opened the medicine packages, at first I couldn't see anything myself. I then crushed the Angelica Dahurica and Poria Cocos and discovered his hiding method: the opium was wrapped in paper, then

sealed with lead

and then wrapped tightly with burlap. Finally, the outer skin of the Angelica Dahurica and Poria Cocos was crushed and glued piece by piece onto the burlap with glue. People who are not careful cannot see it, but it is slightly heavier than real Angelica Dahurica and Poria Cocos. I first unpacked fifty small packets and asked Wang Chengqing to sell them for me. He then introduced Hu and the other two, saying that Lin Menglang, No. 2, Zhongmai Village, Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai, wanted to buy them at a high price. Yesterday, I hired a car to bring the first fifty packets as a sample to

discuss the price with them

Unfortunately, we were caught by the police station in Tongfu Road, etc. At the court, Wang Chengqing was interrogated accordingly, and confessed that he only introduced Li and did not receive any remuneration. The two defendants, Luo and Hu, firmly denied any involvement in helping to sell. The court ordered the defendants to be returned to custody and adjourned the trial to next Friday. The 159 packets of opium that had been unpacked were first stored in the treasury.

### Public Servants Sell Drugs and Internal Conflicts Erupt

Caught in One Net by the Police Station

Yang Keming, from Anhui, was working in the residence of a certain important person. Recently, he joined forces with Chen Meisheng from Chaozhou and Peng Gengsheng from Haimen to engage in the drug trade. Lu Shengde, also known as Lu Shengfa, from Pudong, and Yang Hongsheng from Suzhou (who were Yang Keming's partners), recently Lu Shengde was laid off, and the night before last, he went to Yang Ming and others to get expenses. They quarreled and fought at the entrance of Tiande Pond on Judada Road. Lu Shengde was arrested and confessed to the inside story. The French Concession Police ordered detectives to arrest Yang Keming, Chen Meisheng, Peng Gengsheng, Yang Hongsheng, etc., and seized 14 packets of morphine. Because an investigation was required, yesterday they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District and requested detention for investigation. Judge Liao Yuan of the court ascended the seat to interrogate the defendants about their ages and origins, and ordered the defendants Yang Keming, Lu Shengde, Yang Hongsheng, Peng Gengsheng, and Chen Meisheng to be detained. The trial was adjourned to March 22.

### Hollywood Gambling Den Receives Three Bomb Threats

And Warns Rongsheng Company to Close Down in Three Days, Otherwise They Will Kill Their People and Bomb Their Den

The Hollywood gambling den is the number one in western Shanghai. It has earned two million yuan in three months. Rongsheng Company is second, earning one million in half a year. It has six cars. However, the guerrillas have been very active recently. Hollywood has received three bombs and warning letters. A Pai Gow incident occurred a few days ago. There were four people in total. A burly man bet 600 yuan on the Pai Gow table, but the table had a 500 yuan limit and still reported to the cashier's office. Unexpectedly, the cashier's office was black-hearted and ordered the game to be opened, and ate up the 600 yuan. The burly man then picked up the teapot and smashed the head of the person pushing the Pai Gow. A group of bodyguards threatened with handguns. The burly man and the three people who came with him each pulled out new-style twenty-shot Mauser pistols and fired randomly. People in the gambling den were terrified and kowtowed to apologize, paid back 600 yuan, and sent 1,000 yuan, and promised to send 10 yuan every day. The burly man smiled and took the money and left with the people he came with in a car. Rongsheng Company, within these three days, received three consecutive warning letters from the Anti-Traitors Group, ordering them to close down within the last three days, otherwise they would kill their people and bomb their den. Dasheng Company also received this warning letter, so the gambling den owners did not dare to go to western Shanghai, etc.

### The Dark Side of Society: Two Young Girls Commit Suicide in an Inn

Yesterday, two modern girls committed suicide in a room at the Zhongnan Hotel on Edward Road. According to the investigation, one woman went to the hotel earlier that evening and rented room 224, paying the tea server six yuan for the room. She wrote Wang Yuejuan, 18 years old, from Jiangsu, in the guest book. The tea server did not suspect anything and turned around and left. After a while, another girl of similar age came and entered the room to meet her. At that time, there was also nothing suspicious found. They went to sleep until late at night, lying together in one bed. Until about 9:30 yesterday morning, the waiter suddenly heard groaning sounds in the room. He called out but there was no response. Knowing that something had happened, he quickly reported to the police station and called an ambulance to send them to Renji Hospital. At the same time, a letter to a classmate on Matt Hess Road was left on the bedside, and the words were farewell, so it was determined that they had committed suicide by taking poison. The letter was then taken by the police station for investigation. It was heard that the end of the letter was signed Zhu Xiuzhen. Obviously, Wang Yuejuan was an alias. After the two were taken to the hospital for treatment by car, their condition was very dangerous due to the time elapsed. As of last night, the two were still unconscious and their lives were in danger. As for what stimulation caused them to commit suicide and where their addresses were, the police station is investigating from the classmate to whom the letter was addressed.

Bashing Head Against Wall

At the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Arabus Road in the northern district of the Public Concession, in a small alley in Heji Lane, at around 2:00 PM yesterday, a man of about forty years old repeatedly bashed his head against the wall until he fainted from the pain and rolled around on the ground. After waking up, he continued to bash his head as before. After being asked why he was doing this, he replied that he was from Hang County, Zhejiang. His parents, wife, children, and other eight family members were all burned and killed by the Japanese soldiers. Only he escaped and came to Shanghai to look for relatives and friends but could not find them. All the clothes, etc., he brought with him had been pawned. Having no choice, he did this. It is better to smash himself to death than to starve to death. Then someone gave him a bowl of white rice and a few corner tickets, ordering him to go to a refugee camp to be cared for.

Falling and Injuring

Chen Shanying, a 19-year-old girl from Ningbo, lived at a certain number on Xinza Road. She was a female worker in the egg product refrigeration department of the Warehouse Trust Company at No. 1080, East Broadway Road. Yesterday at about 1:00 PM, she took the company's shuttle truck to Hongkou to work. When she arrived at the place and had not yet stopped, Chen Shanying wanted to get out of the car first, so she jumped off the car, causing her to fall on the stone on the sidewalk. At that time, her head was broken and her face was covered in blood. She was quickly taken to Hu's Hospital for treatment by car. It was heard that her skull was broken and blood was flowing from her ears, nose, and mouth, and her life was in danger.

Throwing Oneself into the River

Xu Denan, a 27-year-old man from Pudong, was suffering from unemployment and economic difficulties, so he had the idea of ​​being tired of the world. At about 8:20 yesterday morning, he went straight to Pier No. 1 on the Bund and jumped into the Huangpu River while people were unprepared, attempting to commit suicide. He was rescued and taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by car.

Run Over

A young girl surnamed Yang, named Duohuan, only five years old, lived at No. 51, Ciann North Lane, Annam Road. Yesterday, at around 3:30 PM, Huanlian was playing with two neighboring children next to the traffic light pole at Foch Road and Hart Road. Suddenly, a No. 788 black-plated car drove up quickly. Yang was unable to avoid it and was knocked down and ran over, breaking her right leg and causing her to faint. Later, the police officer on duty rushed to the scene to record the car number and carried the injured child to the hospital for treatment.

### Gambling Den Bosses in Panic, Taking Strict Precautions

Due to repeated intrusions and shootings at various gambling tables along roads beyond the boundaries of the French Concession in western Shanghai, gambling den bosses and "bao tai jiao" (thugs) are in a state of panic. In addition to increasing the number of puppet police for protection, they have installed iron gates in the entrances of gambling rooms and alleys. Secret rooms have also been created, and important figures are living in seclusion, taking strict precautions. Furthermore, bosses of the Hua Hui lottery headquarters, such as Mao Axiang and Li Xiaotao, fearing attacks by patriotic elements, have not dared to go to the headquarters for days and are said to be hiding in secret locations.

### Child Concealing Weapon Arrested and Confiscated

Confession reveals the weapon was entrusted by bandit leader "Little Drill," with the fugitive bandit leader and two accomplices temporarily detained for further investigation.

The Chinese and foreign detectives of the Gordon Road Police Station, at 6:15 PM the day before yesterday, near the intersection of Gordon Road and Haifang Road, noticed two Jiangbei children, Liang Xiaosanzi and his fellow villager Pang Jinchang, walking unsteadily and acting suspiciously. They were stopped, and a Mauser pistol with seventeen bullets, an automatic pistol without bullets, and eight pawn tickets were found on Liang's person. Upon questioning, it was learned that they lived at No. 24 Changchun Lane, Bailinan Road, and the guns and bullets were given to them by a man named "Little Drill," who asked them to deliver them to a certain alley entrance on Haifang Road. The detectives went to the alley to make an arrest but found he had already fled. They then escorted Liang Xiaosanzi and Pang Jinchang to No. 24 Changchun Lane, Bailinan Road, where they apprehended two women, Lu Li-shi and Wu Liu-shi, and confiscated two flashlights. "Little Drill" had still not returned. However, because the location was in a lost territory, the two women were temporarily detained by the puppet "Great Way Municipal Government" and refused to be handed over. The detectives had no choice but to take Liang and Pang, along with the guns and bullets, to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the two defendants had told the police that the fugitive "Little Drill" was the leader of a bandit gang that, in February of this year, had committed armed robbery in the Old Gate area, with one accomplice, Yang Siqing, already arrested. (It was found that Yang committed fraud in the Public Concession, swindling money from ladies' social clubs and committing robbery). The First Court will announce the verdict today. He requested an extension for further investigation. The guns and bullets were presented for inspection. Liang Xiaosanzi confessed that he had carried the pistol for "Little Drill" three times. Pang Jinchang's testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them remanded in custody for further investigation in seven days.

### Renfeng Factory Lawsuit Settled Amicably

Xu Tingyu, the factory director of the Renfeng Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Factory in this city, previously engaged lawyers Zhang Fayao and E Sen to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District against Zhu Gengtao, the factory's manager, accusing him of conspiring with Zhang Zixin of the Xinchang Cotton Cloth Company to embezzle over 250,000 yuan. The case had been heard approximately twenty times by judges Wu Kechou and Qiu Huan-ying, but had not yet concluded. At the same time, the factory owner Xie Keming's case against Zhu Gengtao for embezzling tens of thousands of yuan had also been summoned several times by the court president. This case is currently being heard by Judge Qiu. For the convenience of the trial, Judge Qiu ascended the bench of the Second Criminal Court yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM and consolidated the two cases for joint hearing. The defendant Zhu Gengtao, accompanied by his defense lawyers Ma Shouhua, Xue Duqi, and Jiang Yiping, and Zhang Zixin, accompanied by his defense lawyers Li Wenjie and Wang Heng, arrived on time to await the hearing. E Sen, the representing lawyer of the plaintiffs Xu Tingyu and Xie Keming, stated to the court that the accounts of the case had not yet been fully investigated and that after several adjustments there were hopes of a peaceful resolution, requesting the court to grant an extension to allow for further investigation of the accounts and negotiation of a settlement. The defendant's defense lawyers also expressed their agreement to the court. The court, upon considering the statements, approved the extension. Both parties went outside to negotiate a settlement on the civil aspects, and the court ordered that the criminal aspects be heard at a later date.

### Renting Land to Build Houses: Abnormal Development

Since the southeastern provinces of Shanghai became war zones, people from various places have moved to the concessions to seek refuge, leading to a situation where the supply of housing in the two special districts cannot meet the demand. Generally, secondary landlords initially rented out rooms at high prices and then transferred the entire property at high interest rates. Renters who had nowhere to live had to rent at these prices to seek temporary peace. In order to adapt to the current environmental needs and passively resist the method of transferring houses at high prices, businesses engaged in real estate and property management have begun to build houses for customers. Tenants are also happy to invest in entrusting construction to reduce the burden of monthly rent. It is understood that the number of merchants who build houses for customers has increased several times compared to before the war. In addition to the existing real estate businesses, various banks, trust companies, accountants, and lawyers have also begun to engage in this business. The method of operation is mostly renting land to build houses, with terms of ten, fifteen, or twenty years. According to those familiar with the real estate situation, the value of building houses for customers in Shanghai is mostly between 3,000 and 5,000 yuan, with the highest price not exceeding 6,000 yuan, which is comparable to the general high transfer fee, so customers who entrust construction benefit a lot more than those who rent. Moreover, merchants who build houses usually return the original amount after the contract expires. Currently, there are more than sixty companies operating in the construction of houses in the two concessions, which can be said to be an abnormal development after the war.

### Manager of the Java Company, Pan Tanghua, Going Abroad for Inspection

More than one hundred factory owners and representatives attended. Zhang Wenkui, representing the Hengyisheng Factory, was elected to deliver a farewell speech. He said that the factories at sea appreciate Mr. Pan and the overseas Chinese inspection team for not hesitating to travel to overseas markets to promote and introduce national goods, sparing no effort, recovering a lot of foreign exchange, making outstanding contributions to people's livelihoods, and increasing national strength. At the same time, he hoped that the factories would maintain a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation and strive to improve, for example, the products and prices must be standardized, and public associations should be established to send samples, etc. On the other hand, he also hoped that Mr. Pan would inform them of the needs of the local situation at any time so that they could improve at any time to expand sales. Mr. Pan replied that the overseas Chinese compatriots' enthusiasm for loving the motherland is increasing day by day, and their understanding of national goods is also increasing day by day. There has been significant progress recently, so their interest in promoting national goods is also increasing. He deeply hoped that the manufacturers would cooperate, work together, and strive forward, which was quite encouraging to the factories. Then, Mr. Lin Hongxing of the overseas Chinese inspection team delivered a thank you speech, and then they took photos and dined before dispersing.

Commentary

### A Casual Discussion on the Prescription Business in Shanghai Pharmacies

— Zheng Jingren

Patients who have good doctors are less likely to die in vain, but if there are good doctors without good medicines, the disease cannot be cured, and if there are good medicines but no formally trained and experienced musicians to prescribe them, they can also take people's lives in an instant. Therefore, no medicine, whether for internal or external use, can be handled by unlicensed pharmacists!

Shanghai is a special area of ​​my country. Before August 13, my country's health laws and regulations could reach the administrative authorities of the two concessions, and advertisements for all kinds of bizarre new drugs were filled in newspapers, and no agency cared about them.

The prescription business is one of the main businesses in a pharmacy, and in principle, a formal pharmacist should be hired to take charge of it, which is by no means something that anyone can do. However, looking around this city (the French Concession authorities have now stipulated that every pharmacy within the boundary should be operated by a pharmacist, otherwise it cannot be opened), I am afraid that only two or three out of ten have formal pharmacists in the prescription room. Even worse, newly opened, smaller-scale pharmacies not only have no pharmacists, but even pharmacy students are difficult to find. The cleanliness and management of the prescription room are also completely disordered. It is surprising that the authorities do not attach importance to the prescription business, which can determine people's lives and is related to the great problem of national health. Moreover, if there are errors in the prescribed drugs, patients have no way of knowing, and misleading patients can lead to people's lives in an instant. How can we not be extra cautious! Mistakes are extremely easy to make when dispensing medicines. In the past, a certain hospital made the big mistake of mistakenly dispensing Atropina as Atophan. I think there are countless examples of this kind. In addition, some pharmacy authorities now like to purchase cheap fake medicines for prescription purposes, such as diluting hydrochloric acid and pretending it is almond water, or using salicylic acid or acetic acid to pretend to be aspirin for sale, which is especially absurd, stealing and harming people. If patients mistakenly take this kind of fake medicine and their symptoms change or even become incurable, they do not suspect that they are harmed by fake medicine, and are determined that it is an error in the doctor's diagnosis. Therefore, the medicines used in the pharmacy's prescription room should be inspected by licensed pharmacists before they can be used if there is any doubt. Otherwise, the patients will suffer undeservedly.

The prescription business is the most profitable business in a pharmacy, and it should not be done sloppily. Merchants value profit, which has been said since ancient times, but the pharmaceutical industry is related to people's lives, so how can we forget righteousness when we see profit!

### Health Preservation During Measles

— Su Zengxiang

— A Notice for Parents —

Measles, commonly known as "chushazi" (getting the rash) or "yuzi," has different names in different regions. After the rash appears, everyone can recognize it. People believe that this disease is unavoidable for children and is one of the most frightening infectious diseases.

Experience tells us that measles itself is not dangerous, but why is it considered so scary? Those who don't understand medicine say they fear whether it will "appear or not" or whether it will "appear completely." Those who understand medicine say they fear complications such as pneumonia, otitis media, bronchitis, true or false diphtheria, tuberculosis, swollen lymph nodes, etc. In reality, the so-called "appear or not" or "appear incompletely" is due to these complications. In Germany, the medical community often treats children with measles or measles with complications by having them wear hats, wrapping them in thick blankets, dressing them warmly, leaving only their faces exposed, and placing their beds in corridors or gardens. The results are very good. Therefore, their mortality rate is much lower than ours! Some people may think I am rambling, but this is what I have witnessed. Originally, as long as the body is warm, even if cold air enters the lungs through the nasal cavity, it will already have warmed up and will not cause harm. On the other hand, in most Chinese families, when a child gets measles, they tightly close the windows and doors, cover them with blankets, and even burn some fumigants in the stove, filling the room with smoke and foul air. In such a polluted atmosphere, if pneumonia does not develop, they still do not know the source of the problem and instead say that measles itself is dangerous. One patient's family told me that a few years ago, her child had measles. She held the child and sat in a mosquito net that was not ventilated, burning things under the bed, causing the child's eyes to roll upwards constantly. Later, after being advised, she stopped. Please tell me, isn't this treatment like climbing a tree to catch a fish? Know that after three or four days of fever, nasal discharge, and other inflammatory conditions, as long as the lungs and heart are well protected and there are no complications, the rash will naturally appear. Of course, we hope it appears quickly and subsides slowly, with a red face rather than a pale one. However, you must know that in a polluted atmosphere and in a state of physical weakness, measles can occur simultaneously with pneumonia (primary, not secondary). Once pneumonia develops, the flow of blood through the capillaries of the skin is blocked, and the rash will not appear, or even if it does, it will immediately disappear. At that time, it is what is commonly called "appear or not" and "appear incompletely." Therefore, what is most important is to understand the cause, understand the principles, and not blindly spread misinformation, which leads to the opposite result. In addition, people generally believe that when suffering from measles, one should seal the eyes, mouth, and nose, resulting in not even daring to wipe the face, which is also a cause of otitis media and pneumonia. I recall when I was young, I saw a relative who often squinted. People told me that this was a symptom she got after having measles. As for pus draining from the ears after having measles (a result of otitis media), everyone considers it common. Measles can also promote diseases such as tuberculosis, which is something ordinary people do not expect. In fact, everything can be prevented and avoided, and we don't have to make such unnecessary sacrifices. Therefore, whether measles is terrible depends on one's ability to preserve health!

As for the saying that measles is an "unavoidable infectious disease for children," it is also not entirely accurate. I have a friend whose two children, one ten years old and one eleven years old, have never had measles because she takes strict precautions. This shows that measles can be avoided! Some people mistakenly believe the saying "unavoidable" and even think that having it early is a relief. This is completely wrong. The younger a child is, the weaker their resistance, and the more likely they are to develop complications. For example, a child whose lungs are originally weak may have their lung disease go from latent to progressive after measles. These are all medical common sense known to ordinary people.

Now, I will write down the eclectic, environment-friendly, and easily implemented methods of health preservation during measles, hoping that parents will pay attention: (1) Strive to keep the indoor air clean. Open a small window in a windless corner of the room. Keep the room temperature warm and moderate. Do not keep the patient suffocated under blankets. For smaller children, you can often change the position in which you carry them to allow all parts of the lungs to be active and prevent pneumonia. If you use a stove, place boiling water on it so that the steam rises and the indoor air does not become dry. Do not burn fumigants or smoke cigarettes. The fewer idlers, the better, in order to maintain clean indoor air. (2) Wash the patient's mouth with cotton dipped in sugar water or boric acid water daily. For older children, they should gargle often. Wash the nasal cavity with cotton swabs wrapped with cotton dipped in boric acid water. Wipe both eyes with cotton soaked in boric acid water. (3) Children with colds, coughs, pneumonia, and other symptoms are prone to complications of otitis media, so pay attention to whether the patient's ears are painful or have abnormalities. You can drip a drop of olive oil as soon as possible. If an infant grabs their ears or scratches their head with both hands, this indicates that the infant's ear may be painful, and it should be checked immediately. (4) Steam method: Use a long-necked lead kettle two or three feet long filled with boiling water and heat it on a water and wine stove or electric stove. When the steam comes out, move it to the child's bedside, as close to the mouth as possible. This method can prevent pneumonia and otitis media. (5) Bowel movements should not be loose, but there should be one bowel movement daily. (6) Do not make the room light too strong to avoid stimulating eyesight. (7) If the fever does not subside five or six days after the rash appears, or if the fever subsides and then rises again, then there must be complications. A detailed examination should be carried out to identify the source of the disease and treat it. (8) In terms of diet, light, soft, easily digestible, and nutritious things can be eaten. Greasy things are not suitable, but absolutely eating vegetarian food is also not advisable, as it easily puts the child in a weaker state.

Common Sense About Losing Sickness

### Diabetes and Polyuria (Part 1)

— Zhou Zhenyu

Diabetes is called "xiaoke bing" (wasting and thirsting disease) in traditional Chinese medicine. However, the written records are not detailed enough. Most traditional Chinese medicine practitioners consider someone with thirst and excessive urination to have "xiaoke bing." However, the symptom of thirst and excessive urination is a key symptom of diabetes, but it is not unique to diabetes, as polyuria also presents this symptom. Diabetes has its own causes and pathology, and polyuria has its own causes and pathology. The two cannot be confused as one. The logic is very clear, so it is necessary to question what "xiaoke bing" actually refers to. I will now explain the two diseases in detail below for readers to study, so as to avoid mistaken identity.

Causes of Diabetes

The cause of diabetes is due to pancreatic deficiency. The pancreas is one of the organs of the human body and has two different functions. One is to control digestion. Its digestive function still involves producing an enzyme that is introduced into the duodenum to mix with food and digest it. There are three types of enzymes: protein enzyme, fat enzyme, and starch enzyme, because food contains protein, fat, and starch.

After food passes through the stomach and intestines and mixes with enzymes, a fermentation effect occurs, transforming the substance of the food into a substance suitable for the human body, such as converting starch into glucose, which permeates into the blood to provide the body with applications.

After each meal, a nerve impulse occurs. When the pancreas receives this impulse, it secretes enzymes, which can be extracted from the pancreatic duct for various experiments. Physiologists call it exocrine.

At the same time, the pancreas produces another substance that controls the action of eliminating sugar, similar to an enzyme, produced by another type of cell tissue within the pancreas. These cells gather in groups, scattered within the pancreatic tissue, not connected to each other, shaped like islands in the ocean. It was first discovered by Langerhaus, so it is called the islets of Langerhaus. The cells of these islets construct a substance called insulin. Insulin is Latin for bird element. When bird element enters the blood, there is no channel for it to pass through. It permeates into the blood through osmosis and cannot be directly extracted from the outside for various experiments, so it is called endocrine.

If islet hormone is lacking or completely depleted, the sugar absorbed by the blood will not only be unable to be used by the body, but some of it will also turn into toxic substances such as organic acid ketones. These toxins circulate with the blood and often paralyze the nerves. If not treated early, mild cases will have nerve pain, and severe cases will develop coma. Part of it will be excreted in urine and stool, so when analyzing urine, sugar will appear.

Excessive eating can easily tire the pancreas. When the pancreas is tired, secretion will become unbalanced. When secretion is unbalanced, diabetes is difficult to avoid. In those who drink alcohol, because the bloodstream contains alcohol, the pancreas is overstimulated. Initially, it may produce too much bird element, leading to an increase in appetite. Meals are often more than normal - this is the so-called bird element abundance syndrome. After a long time, the pancreas becomes tired, and endocrine deficiency occurs, and diabetes gradually develops. Those suffering from syphilis have toxins in their blood that can either harden blood vessels or attack the pancreas, causing its secretion to become unbalanced. This is also a factor in the development of diabetes. Other infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, diphtheria, malaria, and splenic carbuncle also cause toxins to circulate in the blood, hindering the function of the pancreas, leading to increased blood sugar and sugar in the urine. This is another factor.

Pathology of Diabetes

Diabetes, as a disease, has been determined to be a disease of the pancreas through the research of Mr. Ming, Mr. Van Mei, Mr. Xiu, and Mr. Xia. Then, through the research of Mr. Ke, Mr. De, Mr. Du, Mr. Di, and Mr. Ban, it is known that it is caused by a lack of pancreatic endocrine, and an endocrine substance called islet hormone can be directly produced from the pancreas of warm-blooded animals. Mr. Qinghao, Mr. Mao, Mr. Bu, Mr. Dai, and Mr. Ma used lower-level animals to repeatedly experiment with islet hormone and found that its functions are threefold:

(1) Promoting the metabolism of starch.

(2) Increasing the function of converting glucose in the blood into starch that can be stored in the animal body.

(3) Enhancing the function of gasification.

Therefore, once the pancreas is deficient, endocrine will be obstructed, the above three functions will disappear, and diabetes will develop. Those who suffer from diabetes and die, when dissecting their pancreas, often find that the islets of Langerhans have disease characteristics. Therefore, diabetes can be further said to be a disease of the islets of Langerhans. The reason is self-evident.

### Medical Gleanings (Continued)

— Sizhai

Fat Diarrhea

When pancreatic juice secretion is impaired, fat decomposition and absorption both become abnormal. Therefore, the patient's stool is greasy and shiny and contains a large amount of neutral fat. Microscopic examination shows numerous fat droplets and soaps. This is called fat diarrhea.

Physiological or Dietary Laxatives

For those with habitual constipation, nutritional therapy should be emphasized in treatment. Rice with wheat, wild vegetables, potatoes, beans, mushrooms, fruits such as peaches and plums, sugar, honey, and fats can all make intestinal peristalsis more active, so they are suitable for use. The above items are called physiological or dietary laxatives.

Liver Consumption

The term "liver consumption" does not refer to tuberculosis of the liver. During the course of liver abscesses, there is often fever, consumption, and weakness, often with chills and night sweats. The symptoms are very similar to pulmonary tuberculosis, hence the name "liver consumption."

### Praising the Teachers and Students of the Sicun School

— Maolie

During the "January 28th" incident, we knew that many students from Fudan University and Jinan University rushed to the front lines to participate in the war of resistance. After "August 13th," similar students could be seen everywhere. They disregarded everything and participated in direct actions to save the country. We praise them.

A professor at a certain university in Beiping led a group of students and workers to the western suburbs to carry out guerrilla warfare after Beiping fell. We praise this patriotic teacher.

The Shanghai Sihang Warehouse defenders were unyielding and vowed to use their last drop of blood to preserve the last piece of national territory until the supreme commander ordered a retreat before the entire division crossed the Suzhou River. We also praise their bravery.

Now, when we see the "loyalty, bravery, and martyrdom" of the teachers and students of the Jinnan Sicun School, our praise cannot but be consistently poured onto these teachers and students.

Speaking of the students, "most are underage youths." Their entire participation in a "do-or-die battle" with the enemy is even more commendable than the students from Fudan and other schools. Speaking of the teachers, each one is like a certain professor in Beiping. Having good teachers gathered in one school is also rare. Moreover, their entire body of teachers and students "often disarmed enemies with their bare hands," and "their equipment was too poor and unfavorable, so the casualties were quite heavy," making it even more difficult than the Sihang Warehouse defenders. Even if they became the isolated army of Yao Ziqing and the army was annihilated, we would naturally offer incense and prayers for them, and venerate them for thousands of years. The fact that they were actually able to "break through completely," "killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers and destroying five Japanese military vehicles," and "their deeds are enough to make ghosts and gods weep and scare the Japanese army," how can we not prostrate ourselves and sincerely praise them as the "model for teachers and students of schools across the country"!

In their case, they only intended to kill the enemy and serve the country loyally and did not hope for our praise or the government's "preferential compensation," but their praise and compensation are what they deserve. Moreover, I believe that their "generous and courageous spirit" will eventually last for thousands of years!

Looking back at the teachers and students in Shanghai schools now, what are they doing? Among them, there are naturally outstanding individuals who have done things to save the country that are worthy of praise. However, we often hear of principals who "do not allow patriotic organizations," Chinese language teachers who advocate "rather be a dog in peace than a person in chaos," and young students who "do not forget to dance while saving the country." For these things, we really want to cry but have no tears and don't know where to start weeping!

We don't know what the "four cuns" originally meant. But we can say, "To preserve righteousness for heaven and earth, to preserve aspirations for the nation, to preserve vitality for the country, to preserve integrity for the scholar community," they are worthy of this "four cuns" without shame!

### Sawing the Bridge

— Zou Yaosheng

Xiao Ming ran from afar, his head steaming with heat, panting as he winked at Ah Yuan, who was chatting with Sixty Old Daddy, looking both nervous and panicked. Sixty and Ah Yuan couldn't help but be stunned in their leisurely mood.

"Young people are really not calm. Is there any news? Speak, there are only the two of us here." Sixty said, his face so peaceful, with wrinkles around his eyes and on his forehead, marking his age.

"Old Zhang reported that the Third Squad will leave the town tomorrow, with one large truck and one small covered truck, already filled with fuel! They will pass through ×× Road to × Town around 7 o'clock at dawn."

"Is that certain?" Ah Yuan asked excitedly.

"Of course, Old Zhang said it so truthfully and even told me not to miss this opportunity."

"One squad...one large truck, one small truck...×× Road...seven o'clock..." Sixty muttered these words to himself, as if in deep thought.

As night fell, the backs of these three passionate comrades disappeared into the evening mist.

A crescent moon hung on the distant treetops. A narrow, gravelly ancient road stretched windingly from the far east to the northwest. In the middle of the road was a dead river. Judging from the ripples on the water surface illuminated by the moonlight, it did not seem like the usual murky stagnant water; it was so clear and beautiful; it was quite deep. A wooden bridge was built over it, supported by four pine trunks. Below, there was a rustling sound, breaking the silence of the night. Suddenly, the two ends of the pine trunks were completely broken, and deep cracks appeared at both ends of the wooden boards, but they had not yet collapsed.

"Xiao Ming, the work is almost done. Tell everyone to go to sleep. Remember! Five o'clock before dawn; also, don't forget to bring the gear!" Someone was ordering someone. An old man was lying in the reeds by the river, gazing dreamily at the crescent moon, with a dry tobacco pipe in his mouth. Faint wisps of smoke seeped through the reed flowers, still so leisurely and peaceful.

"Ah Yuan, we have only this way to deal with a squad with twenty some people... Tell them in the reeds, aim with the gear, if the large truck is in front, take out the running rabbits, no need to say. If the small truck is in front, then things will be tricky!... Ah; might as well go all the way, and just let my old life be!" A layer of determined frost smeared the old man's face.

"Yes, Old Daddy." The person there watched silently, gripping their hands tightly like iron.

Fish-belly white light shone from the east in the distance, and a thin white frost had already flashed faintly over the earth, concealing all the filth and imperfections.

After a flurry of activity in the reeds and grass piles by the river, it gradually became quiet again. Sixty Old Daddy wiped his nose spiritedly, put his arm around Ah Yuan's shoulder:

"Brother, we are confident today. Aren't you hearing the magpies congratulating us? Haha..."

Suddenly, a continuous sound came from afar, getting louder and louder. The outline of a grayish-yellow truck slowly became clear. The emotions here were tense, and the eyes filled with sparks were wide open.

"Comrades, calm down! Success is guaranteed today, the large truck is in front!" Although this group of people had considerable experience in warfare, Ah Yuan, because of his leadership position, was concerned that everyone would not be able to restrain their emotions, so he gave this instruction.

The truck had reached the foot of the bridge, the heads of the full truckload of Japanese devils ducking as they trembled, fearfully aiming their guns at the surrounding fields. The truck rumbled onto the bridge deck.

"Whoosh—! Boom—!"

"Bang! Bang! Bang!" Sparks came from the reeds, and a reddish tinge rippled through the clear river water.

The small truck stopped with a "screech," quickly set up a machine gun, and the muzzle roared aimlessly.

"Young men, charge! The Japanese officer on that small truck." Sixty was the first to dart out of the grass pile, but he fell straight down. The crowd behind him covered over like a tide.

"Bang, bang, bang, bang...Gugugu..." In response to the sound of rifles, one by one the Japanese devils fell, but the machine gun bullets continued to ravage the grass piles and dirt on the riverbank.

Now, there was silence. Ah Yuan ran to the side of Sixty Old Daddy and saw him lying quietly there; his shattered guts mixed with the dirt on the ground; yet he opened his mouth wide, as if silently calling out. Ah Yuan knelt down with a thud, tears hanging from the corners of his eyes; "Old Daddy, you are the father of China, rest peacefully. The children will grow up from blood!"

### Strange Bedfellows

— He

### Luck, Complacency, Peace

— Chen Ren

Putting decades of hard-won effort at stake in a gamble of luck is undoubtedly a suicidal policy. In the face of a powerful enemy, failing to rise up in resistance and only seeking temporary complacency is tantamount to sitting and waiting for death.

Luck and complacency are both undesirable. However, the world is full of people who seek luck, and the only hope of the lucky rests on the complacent.

However, the world is full of elements seeking complacency, and the only hope of the complacent is peace.

The foundation of peace is not built on complacency. All peace-loving people in the world should seek survival in struggle, and strike a head-on blow to those who seek luck at any time. If one seeks compromise through concessions, seeks complacency through compromise, and seeks peace through complacency, that is simply courting death.

The lucky ones opened their bloody mouths and swallowed Guangzhou, Hainan Island, and South China piece by piece; but the complacent ones are still dreaming of peace. But where is peace? The answer is a chorus of bombs and gunfire, and the blood and flesh of tens of millions of innocent people flying horizontally.

When peace is hopeless and the psychology of the complacent loses its basis, the hopes of the lucky are bound to fail. Only when the last gamble is thrown down can the dawn of true peace reappear in the world.

### On "Her Mother's" (Part 2)

— Chi Qiang

Investigating the background of the emergence of "Her Mother's," it turns out there are several such social situations. I cannot cover them all here. I hope those with ambition will keep a close eye on her in this vast land of China:

When oppression becomes unbearable, when "eating the wall" until it collapses, when bullying strips one of their humanity, "Her Mother's" becomes action! Action arrives! "Raising the banner," naturally, the call is "Her Mother's"! "All under heaven gather in response," responding because there is a "Her Mother's" over there too. "Bringing provisions and following like shadows," following the call of "Her Mother's"! Going to hell to build paradise! Resolutely building it!

A roar! I cannot finish writing about all the scenes of roaring. I only know that from the roar of "Her Mother's" comes the starting point of a turned-over China, a brilliant and promising future. In this crucible, a new mechanism has been forged. Believe it or not, facts prove it.

I cannot write superficial articles, nor can I fail to raise my arm and shout "Her Mother's" with the times of "Her Mother's." As for the spirit that enables the success of "Her Mother's," one cannot help but use existing examples as annotations:

From the front lines: "Her Mother's! Take them down!"

In some corners, they are shouting: "Her Mother's! Clean them out! Let the reckoning begin!"

From the rear: "Causing families to be ruined! Her Mother's! I might as well throw away my old life! Charge forward!"

Some are still saying this: "So it's this kind of trick! The Way of Kings, the Way of Her Mother's! It's either me or you!"

The passionate spirit is even more so: "Risk it all! Go all in! Her Mother's!"

This orderly, resounding, proactive, magnificent, strong, beautiful, and reasonable voice has carved a deep and wide chasm in the national character, and has also abandoned all that has come before after this cry of "Her Mother's," leaving nothing behind.

Look! Wherever "Her Mother's" goes, stones and metal are opened!

This spirit, this epoch-making, decisive, and straightforward spirit, should be praised! We wish "Her Mother's" a bright future! And we hope it will be brought into full play! To turn a new page in Chinese history!

Humanity seeks survival, the nation seeks rebirth, and you have already inspired half of the great achievements! I believe victory in the War of Resistance is in sight. However, seeking perfection, I cannot help but offer a sincere wish: when building the nation, we must also maintain this proactive new spirit.

If the institutions are not right, if they are not a prerequisite for national interests, if they are not necessary materials for building the nation, then we must honestly and unceremoniously "show great ambition"—"Her Mother's," throw them out! Throw everything out and bring in what is reasonable!

Is this saying a new cornerstone in the period of transformation of the Chinese national character?

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

Ten: The Fall of Hepu Town

Despite Commander Ye's repeated instructions to the soldiers, calling on them to remain calm and not to be afraid when encountering the enemy, it seemed that because the event was so sudden, many soldiers, just like the civilians, had only just emerged from the joyful New Year and were now facing the god of war. Their hearts could not settle down no matter what. In addition, enemy planes were constantly bombing the town, and the cries and shouts of the civilians were endless. All of this affected the morale of the front lines, causing their fighting spirit to diminish invisibly.

However, the biggest fatal flaw was the lack of heavy artillery in the troops. The enemy's attack, however, seemed to be planned, using the occupied transportation lines to bring all kinds of heavy weapons to attack Hepu Town. Battalion Commander Zhao Desheng led his troops to block the enemy at Qilidun. After two hours of fierce fighting, although reinforcements arrived in a steady stream, they had to retreat due to the enemy's overwhelming firepower, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifice.

As soon as the Qilidun defense line retreated, the enemy's vanguard approached Hepu Town from the southeast. Soldiers ambushed in the woods began to shoot at the enemy, and many fell in response. This was originally a good piece of protective terrain, but under the enemy's fierce artillery fire, it became a clear target. Hundreds of pounds of shrapnel fell directly into the woods, uprooting the trees. Commander Ye had no choice but to order the troops to retreat across the river, and he personally used a grenade launcher to destroy the only small stone bridge on the river.

Thus began a thrilling street battle. Under the complex symphony of bombs, artillery, light and heavy machine guns, and rifles, amidst the smoke and fire, every warrior gritted their teeth, calmly hiding in the civilian homes, behind the trees, on the rooftops along the river, aiming and shooting at the enemy. Because the river was not wide, the enemy repeatedly attempted to swim across, but was swept back by our army's machine guns. Finally, their heavy weapons caught up, and they used the woods as cover to bombard the other side of the river. In the "boom boom" of the heavy artillery, the civilian houses along the river were broken and collapsed, and the warriors ambushed inside made heroic sacrifices. Commander Ye, seeing this situation, knew that it was impossible to hold out any longer, and had to order a tearful retreat, temporarily allowing his hometown to be ravaged by wolves and tigers.

After the retreat order was issued, the soldiers fired their guns at the opposite bank while slowly retreating north. However, there were also a few soldiers who, having received the order, continued to shoot, preferring to die rather than retreat. In this way, they held out against the enemy for another hour, until the sun was about to set, when the enemy and Lone-Eye Li's bandit troops completed their so-called "mopping-up" operation.

Although Commander Ye had ordered Liang Tuanfu to notify the civilians to evacuate as soon as the enemy planes began bombing, because the event was sudden and unexpected, and it was still the New Year, no one was prepared. Therefore, the number of people who escaped was less than a third of the town's population. (32)

### Shanghai Female Police Active on the Battlefield

— Dong Tian

Almost everyone knows about the female police officers who served at the North and South Railway Stations in Shanghai, as well as in the western part of Shanghai and at the 16th pier. Wearing black Zhongshan suits on their upper bodies, black skirts, leggings, and leather shoes, they walked on the road as bravely as our male police officers.

There were more than thirty of them, all with strong physiques. As for their education, some were even attending institutions of higher learning. At that time, at the training institute on Dapu Road, they underwent three lectures and two exercises every day. After six months, they were all assigned to various sub-bureaus to practice social service. I often met them at the North Railway Station. At that time, none of them were not working diligently. As for them being commended by the bureau chief for finding large quantities of opium or confiscating several pistols, that was even more common. During the "August 13th" Incident, they were still calmly serving in Nanshi, and even shot and killed a traitor in front of Director Wen's memorial碑!

Don't underestimate them; their courage is no less than that of men. I remember last spring, more than a dozen of them wanted to go to Guangdong. After only one collective discussion, they bravely set off. When they arrived in Shunde County, Guangdong, they temporarily lived in Daliang Village. Before long, each of them had found something to do. Several were promoted to female instructors in the militia cadres, while the rest were either engaged in propaganda or fundraising. Their work achievements were amazing. Some parents wrote letters asking them to return to the group, but they all refused in their replies. They even said, "...Where is the home when the country is broken...? Saving the country requires spirit. How can we let men bear the responsibility alone?" These words truly put to shame many men who are greedy for life and afraid of death! As for their recent situation, one of them wrote in a letter: "There are more than a dozen of us, although our work is different and we have moved to many places, we always live together and always follow the front lines of the national army. Although we live in a bloody and stormy environment, we do not have the slightest fear." They are still in the counter-attacking troops, waiting for the opportunity to fight the enemy!

### Martyrdom

— Ge Er

According to reports, a heroic and moving act of martyrdom recently occurred in Chengdu. The facts are as follows: On February 5th of this year, Air Force XX Squadron Leader Liu Fuhong, a valiant warrior, was ordered to lead several aircraft to Yuncheng, Shanxi, to bomb the Japanese airfield. After dropping more than a hundred bombs and destroying more than forty Japanese aircraft, he was preparing to return to his base when, unexpectedly, upon reaching Lintong, due to adverse weather conditions and heavy fog, he lost his way and was forced to land, suffering serious injuries and dying. When this unfortunate news reached the ears of Liu's newlywed wife, Ms. Chen Yingfan, she first attempted suicide by taking poison. Fortunately, she was discovered and saved in the hospital. However, Ms. Chen's love for her husband was extremely deep, and her intention to die for love had not been dispelled. Therefore, taking advantage of a moment when people were not paying attention, she secretly took a pistol and killed herself, wounding herself in a vital spot, and ultimately fulfilling her intention to die for love. Ms. Chen's profound love for her husband, which was described by the newspaper as a heroic act of martyrdom, is truly moving.

However, although we deeply mourn Ms. Chen's "martyrdom," we really cannot agree with her doing so.

"Martyrdom" was originally the so-called "virtue of women" in our feudal era. It was actually a cruel "torture" imposed by a male-centered society on the weak female masses. When a woman married a man, she lost everything. Not only her physical body, but even her soul and spirit, no longer belonged to her. In ancient times, if the emperors of some Eastern nations died, then their empresses and concubines had to die for them. Therefore, after thousands of years, when our geologists excavate the earth's crust, they can still unintentionally find "mummies" in "sealed tombs." This can be said to be the most typical example. Other examples, such as "chastity arches," are everywhere as long as we return to the countryside. When some of our pseudo-moralists shake their heads and praise the "chastity arches," they are actually spitting out blood from the corners of their mouths.

However, this feudal and barbaric "torture" of women by men has struck an unbreakable foundation in the minds of women, who regard it as a "virtue" and sadly sacrifice themselves, allowing some pseudo-moralists to spit out blood while shaking their heads in praise. This is a misfortune and a tragedy for the Chinese female masses! In this great crucible of resisting the war and building the nation, we must deal with this "torture" as we deal with the enemy, and clear the minds of the female masses of this poisonous consciousness that harms themselves and deprives them of their humanity!

Now is the era for women to have their own independence and humanity. They are also members of society and the nation. Therefore, they also have their due obligations and rights to society and the nation. "Martyrdom" is not a "virtue" of a modern woman, but rather, it is an "evil virtue" of a modern woman!

Therefore, Chen Yingfan should not have died for her husband, Liu Fuhong. Since Warrior Liu had already sacrificed himself for the country, then Ms. Chen should have even more so raised the spirit of struggle a hundred or a thousand times for the sake of national and personal grievances, and demanded her blood debt from our national enemy!

However, Chen Yingfan ultimately died for love. This is not her fault. This is the remnant of the old era that killed her. Ms. Chen's "martyrdom" has once again exposed one of the "evil deeds" of the old era. Our war of resistance, together with the enemy, will sweep away the remnants of the old era! Chinese women! Arise!

Eighth Scene

(Dan rushes on, falls, sings) Suddenly, I hear the drums of war, the army pressing on the border. In this situation, it is hard for me to bear! I don't know what has become of Chancellor Fan. I have no choice but to throw myself into the well and end this miserable life! (Speaks) Alas, the army has arrived. Rather than be captured, bringing shame to my ancestors and earning the reputation of betraying the country, I might as well die by throwing myself into the well! But I don't know where Lang is, nor have I heard the news of a great victory over the Jin soldiers. I will die with my eyes open! Alas! It's too late to say anything now! (Acts as if to throw herself into the well, Sheng rushes on and pulls her back) Young lady, why are you taking your own life? (Dan) Don't meddle in my business, let me die! (Sheng) There is no reason for this, how can I stand by and watch you die? (Dan looks back) Ah! (Sheng releases her) Ah! (Dan) You, you, you... (Sheng) You, you, you... (Dan) Father! (Sheng) My child! (Dan) Father! (Kneels) (Sheng) My child! (Cries in longing) I thought we would never meet in this life, who knew we would meet again here. (Helps her up, they cry together) How did you get here, my child? (Dan) Father, please listen! (Sings) Since that day, I was captured by the enemy soldiers, I met Fan Xizhou, he was also in the enemy camp. (Sheng) What kind of person is that Luo Xizhou? (Dan sings) Fan Xizhou, he is also a scholar; he has no choice but to endure, temporarily staying in the enemy camp. (Sheng) What are his grievances? (Dan sings) He wants to persuade King Fan to wash his hands and surrender; who knew, all his good intentions were wasted. (Sheng) He should have abandoned darkness and turned to the light! (Dan) Exactly. (Sings quickly) Hearing that the Han army was approaching the border, he led his confidants out of the city. He was determined to go to the military camp to turn to the light and fight the Jin soldiers. (Sheng) Good, a good man! How do you know this so clearly? (Dan looks down, slightly embarrassed) I saw that he was no ordinary person, and I couldn't help but develop affection for him. He wanted to marry me, and I secretly agreed. (Kneels) Please forgive me for not informing you. (Sheng) Hmm! Trapped in the enemy's camp, there is nothing to be said! Since Chancellor Fan is a young and handsome man, and willing to work for the country, my child has chosen a hero with great vision. If your father were to choose a son-in-law, it would be no different! It's a pity I haven't met him yet, and I don't know if he is safe or not. This is killing me! (Dan) Why is Father here? (Sheng) Because I used to be the tax supervisor in Fuzhou, and I am familiar with the customs and traditions of Fujian, so General Han specially recruited me. As the military saying goes, know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle. Whenever there are any difficulties in marching, they all ask me. Just now, General Han ordered me to search for the remnants of the Fan clan here, but unexpectedly I saved my child's life. Child, come with me, hahahahaha! (Both exit)

Ninth Scene

(Chou enters) Oh no, something terrible has happened! I am a tailor. Jin Wushu and Liu Yu have joined forces and led five thousand cavalry to capture Luzhou. I must use the Thirty-Six Stratagems and flee! (Flees, a Jin soldier with a knife enters) There is an enemy there, I will kill him! (Chou) Wait, wait, old friend! (Points to his own nose) I am not the enemy, I am a civilian! (Jin soldier) A civilian is good too. Treating civilians as enemies is our specialty. Come, come, take my knife! (Chou) I can give you my head, but I have a brother who won't allow it. (Jin soldier) Who is your brother? Tell him to come and meet me. (Chou) My brother (Quickly pulls out a ruler from his clothes and waves it, then puts it behind his back) Look, it's the thing you're holding in your hand. (Pulls out the ruler again and quickly slashes) Watch the knife! (Jin soldier backs away) I didn't see that coming, you have some skills. A hero doesn't suffer immediate losses. I will go forward and apologize, this is our old trick. (To Chou) I was blind and mistook you for an enemy soldier. I apologize to you! (Raises his hand and performs a foreign bow) (Chou) Hmph, hmph! (Jin soldier points to his mouth) Look, what is that? (Chou turns his head) (Jin soldier) Slip away! (Runs into the exit) (Chou) Haha, he ran away! Bullying the weak and fearing the strong, what a coward; timid as a mouse, using a ruler as a knife. (Takes out the ruler) He doesn't know that this is a ruler for measuring clothes! Little devil, little devil, I have already experienced your courage! Hahaha...! I must hurry on my way! (Exits)

### Impressions of "Turning into an Ape-Man"

— Bai Hua

Produced by Xinhua, Distributed by China United, Premiering at Jincheng

Losing love and losing a job are the two major problems that generally plague young people. Bai Jianping in "Turning into an Ape-Man" was oppressed by powerful people, lost his job, and lost his love. Like countless young people, he was tormented by these two major problems. But Mrs. Hu saw this opportunity and, relying on her beauty and money, wanted to seize the pure soul of this young man. Bai Jianping felt that this was an insult that was intolerable. But in his anger and frustration, how did he (like most young people) overcome the current difficulties? The playwright of "Turning into an Ape-Man" catered to the fantasy of revenge of the general petty bourgeois. Bai Jianping, under the decision to "feel that there is nothing to miss in life and resolutely make an experiment," injected himself with poison. He transformed into an ape-man, and in his outburst of wildness, insulted Mrs. Hu and retaliated against the people he hated. But this method of fantasized revenge, like most young people when they are rationally conscious, made him feel "ashamed and hateful, and greatly condemned by his conscience." When Mrs. Hu came to visit him, he comforted her, returned the money she had seized, and immediately sent the poison to the research lab, "deciding not to try it again." But the second blow followed, Zhang Xuansheng, who made him lose his love and his job, was about to marry his lover and also insulted him. "Under this stimulation," Bai Jianping's reason was again disillusioned, "feeling that in this turbid world, only the actions of beasts can deal with everything." So he injected himself with poison again, transformed into an ape-man. At this time, he not only attacked the Mrs. Hu and Zhang Xuansheng he hated, he even hated all mankind. He insulted every woman he met and tore up banknotes. As a result, when he was shot and killed, he only received Peilin's cheap sympathy: "He was made this way by the environment." Yes, every young person, even every Chinese person, is oppressed by the harsh environment, and that is more than losing love and losing a job. To survive in such a dangerous environment requires constant effort and struggle to smash the shackles of evil forces. Lamenting and sympathizing do not help the facts, and may even lead to more terrible consequences!

Speaking of making horror films, we must admit that we cannot beat Hollywood. For example, the terrifying atmosphere when the ape-man appears in this film is not enough. When Jianping transforms, he cannot use lighting or sound to enhance the tense atmosphere. But the director also has his own efforts. For example, after Bai Jianping lost his job, he used frantic piano music to accompany his inner turmoil. When Jianping met Zhang Xuansheng in the research room, first there was Zhang Xuansheng's voice, followed by a close-up of Zhang Xuansheng. Behind him was the model of the ape-man, on the one hand showing Zhang Xuansheng's terribleness, and at the same time giving Jianping a stimulus, causing him to inject himself with poison again in order to fulfill his desire for revenge.

Wang Yin's performance as the ape-man is very serious. The best scene is when Peilin comes to tell Zhang Xuansheng that she is moving to another place to get married. When he is in great pain, his own poisoning is about to break out again. He hands the pistol to Peilin and asks her to use it for self-defense in case of emergency. When he falls onto the sofa to transform, the combination of inner pain and the pain of the poison breaking out is performed very realistically.

The sound recording of this film is rather blurry, and the lighting is a bit dim.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Five: Spring Arrives at Green Beryl, Fragrance Floats on the Snowy Sea, Flowers Fly at Tiger Hill, the Moon Fills Li Lake

After their meal, they didn't dare to delay any longer and sent Wu Junsu back to her school. Originally, this Soochow University was jointly run by China and the United States. Counting all the departments together, there were more than 8,000 university students. Only the liberal arts, medicine, and science departments were located in Greater Suzhou. In addition, a law school was still located in Shanghai. An agricultural college was located in Kunshan. An engineering college was located in Wuxi. There were also twelve affiliated middle schools in Changzhou, Yixing, Taicang, Changshu, Songjiang, and Jiading. Combining the university and middle school students, there were more than 20,000 people. Among them, there were not only Chinese students, but also foreign students. Among the foreign students, there were naturally more Americans, but there were also British, French, Germans, Siamese, Indians, and Filipinos. Statistics showed that 3% were foreigners, and the rest were Chinese. Among the teachers, 30% were foreigners, and the rest were Chinese, but among these 30%, Americans also accounted for the majority. Zhu Airen hurriedly sent Wu Junsu back to Soochow University, fearing that she would miss class. Fortunately, when they arrived, it was still early. Wu Junsu also wanted to lead the two Miss He around the school for a tour. Zhu Airen said, "Forget it! Just walking around your school will take half a day. It's better to come back another day and ask for guidance! Otherwise, I also have two friends in the medical school, and I won't have time to visit them either." Wu Junsu also had class and didn't have time to entertain them, so she said, "Then, Dr. Zhu and the two elder sisters, if you come again, be sure to send me a letter. I am very sorry that I couldn't entertain the two elder sisters. Furthermore, in our liberal arts college, there is a drama research association, and they perform a few plays a year. The next performance is coming soon, but the date has not been set yet. When that day comes, I will send you tickets and invite you to see the play. I will also invite Danyu to come. You must come." The two Miss He both said, "We will definitely come! We will definitely come!" Wu Junsu was a person who liked friends very much. Although she had only spent half a day with Shuangyu and Liyu, she felt that they had a common interest and were two good companions. At this time, they were reluctant to part. After Zhu Airen sent Wu Junsu to school, she discussed with the two Miss He in the car, "Elder sisters, tell me honestly: are you going to stay in our hospital this time, or are you going to stay at my grandfather's Freedom Village? Staying in the hospital is inevitably noisy, but going to Freedom Village is much quieter and more comfortable. But I am hindered by my medical work and cannot come to Freedom Village every day. This is a regret." It is said that the moon pavilion and cloud building are for guests to live in, and the mountain village and waterfront are for guests to come to. (60)

Entertainment World

### Arts and Entertainment Circles and Disaster Relief Movement

— Jin Ding

Relief for refugees is everyone's responsibility and obligation. People in the arts and entertainment circles are no exception. On the contrary, they should make the greatest efforts and be the pioneers for all walks of life. In this regard, people in the arts and entertainment circles seem to have already begun their mission. For example, the first standing committee meeting of the Arts and Entertainment Broadcasting Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association unanimously resolved to gather people from the arts and entertainment broadcasting circles in the city to continue their efforts to assist in the disaster relief work. This is indeed a good phenomenon; however, in my opinion, if the disaster relief movement in the arts and entertainment circles is only carried out by broadcasting people alone, its effectiveness will not be widespread and significant. We should unite all the practitioners in the arts and entertainment circles in Shanghai, whether they belong to the film, drama, storytelling, broadcasting, opera, dance halls, etc. Everyone needs to unite and stand on the same front to work together on a large-scale disaster relief movement in the arts and entertainment circles. In addition to each entertainer wearing a "Philanthropy Medal" donated by the Shen Bao, they should also persuade their relatives and friends to save unnecessary waste in life and walk on the path of "it is a joy to do good." Because our saving two yuan can teach a refugee a semester of production education and learn a skill to make a living, which is very easy for us to do, but the refugees will benefit infinitely. People in the arts and entertainment circles should indeed take on the great responsibility to vigorously promote this practical and effective disaster relief movement.

I hope with all my heart that every arts and entertainment practitioner will do their best to "move people to do good" in their own work, and highlight the significance of refugee production education, so that under the leadership of fellow comrades in the arts and entertainment circles, the tens of thousands of refugees on the "isolated island" who are "homeless" or "unable to return home" can gain the skills to make a living and solve the difficulties of life, which is truly a immeasurable achievement.

### Rambling Talk on Newsreels

— Dai Zi

European and American News Events Can Be Shown in Shanghai in One or Two Months. Cameramen, Like News Reporters, Must Be Quick-Eyed and Quick-Handed

The fall of Barcelona in the Spanish war, the earthquake in Chile, and the death of the Pope in Rome, these events all happened in the last month or two. But newsreels about these events could already be seen in Shanghai cinemas last week. Those who don't know the inside story may wonder if there is something special about the production and transportation of these newsreels that makes them so fast.

In fact, the rapid production and screening of newsreels is due to the air traffic. After the cameraman shoots the new event, he sends it back to the company by air mail, and the film company rushes to develop and edit it successfully, and then transports it to major cities around the world by air. All major newsreels with news value are produced and transported in this way.

The Hollywood film companies, which are larger in scale, have special departments for the production of newsreels. Among them, Fox Film Corporation attaches special importance to the shooting of newsreels. They have resident cameramen stationed in various parts of the world, especially in capitals and major cities. In this way, if an inevitable or accidental new event occurs in a certain city, it can be captured on camera, and the film can be sent back to the company, sorted out, and edited to make a complete newsreel.

All accidental events, such as major fires, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, etc., are not known in advance and are accidental. Therefore, after the event occurs and the news is received, the cameraman immediately goes to shoot, which is unexpected and accidental. As for inevitable events, such as various commemorative ceremonies, grand gatherings, military parades, naval and military exercises, etc., news is received in advance, and on the date, you can bring a camera and go to shoot.

When shooting newsreels of fixed events, the value of the news may sometimes change and fluctuate due to changes. For example, one day the king attends a military parade and personally inspects the army. The cameraman has received the news in advance, and on that day, he brought a camera and prepared to shoot, but there was a temporary change. The king could not attend due to illness or other reasons and sent a representative to inspect. Then the value of the newsreel taken was lowered. Similarly, during the parade, if the king was assassinated or a car accident occurred, or a riot broke out, the value of the film taken would be increased. This unexpected gain was not known to the cameraman in advance.

If a cameraman specializes in shooting newsreels, in addition to having photography skills, he must also be familiar with journalism. In a new event, certain shots cannot be missed, certain shots can be abandoned, and certain shots must be taken in close-up. Two cameramen shoot the same news, and the results are different. The quality depends on the photography skills and the differences in the selection and omission from the perspective of journalism. In short, a cameraman who shoots newsreels, like a news reporter, must have a sensitive mind, be quick-eyed and quick-handed, and shoot shots that others cannot shoot to be considered outstanding!

### Casual Notes

— Zhi Bai

Mr. Yang, in this journal's discussion of opera at Chunjiu Lu, said that Yan Shishan was Yan Lanqiu (son of Jiuzhenfeng), which is actually wrong. Shishan is the son of Lanqiu's younger brother, Lanting, and is also not the grandson of Zhu Sishi (Wenying). However, Shishan's art was actually taught by Lanqiu himself, so he was able to inherit the mantle of his uncle and surpassed Song Dezhu, Zhu Shengfu, and others, becoming one of the best of the younger generation of female martial artists.

The lower partner (i.e., the one who takes the hit) is even more important for female martial artists than for male martial artists. Because female martial arts plays often emphasize the strike, if the lower partner is slightly worse, it will be difficult to see the brilliance of the strike. The lower partners of famous female martial artists such as Jiuzhenfeng and Zhu Guifang are all famous figures. Yan Shishan's father, Lanting, used to be the lower partner of Jiuzhenfeng. He and Jiuzhenfeng co-starred in "Stealing the Immortal Herb" and took various dramas from Jinling. Their strikes were extremely wonderful, like a green leaf setting off a peony. Zhu Guifang's lower partner is Zhu Xiangquan, who is also related to Guifang. He is good at playing the monk in "Sizhou City" and is also a leader in martial arts.

Sun Erniang in the play "Cross Slope" is also a play that female martial artists should perform. Wu Song is also the protagonist in the play. In his early years, Gaitian always had Qi Caifen play Sun Erniang. Qi was the "wine master" of female martial artists in Jiangnan. He and Gaiwu's performance was truly seamless. After Gaiwu retired, Qi changed to Zhang Yipeng as her partner. The last time Gaiwu came back to the stage and performed "Renewal," he tried hard to find a talented female martial artist. Although Zhou Jufang joined, Zhou was definitely not a top talent. This time, Gaiwu performed again and invited Shui Shangpiao to cooperate. Shui Shangpiao is difficult to compare with Qi Caifen, but her experience and reputation are similar to Qi's, and she is ultimately better than Zhou Jufang.

There are even fewer talented female martial artists in Jiangnan than in the north, and they have become as rare as morning stars. Only one in a hundred is valued. Only female actor Fen Juhua once supported the market for a while, but now Fen Juhua's art has declined, and because she is old and her beauty has faded, she is no longer valued by the world. She has even been reduced to Ying'er in Qunping Mountain. Therefore, in practical terms, Jiangnan simply does not have a perfect female martial artist talent.

Child star Ye Xiaozhu is Lucy's younger brother and Zhao Dan's brother-in-law. In "Mulan Joins the Army," he loudly said: "Sister, if you can't beat those guys, just write a letter back, and I will help you!" He also played a role in "Transformation into an Ape-Man." He seems to be a promising child.

### A Great Undertaking by the Hong Kong Drama Troupe: A Collective Performance to Commemorate the Martyrs of Huanghuagang

### (Nie Ge)

More than 40 drama troupes co-star in a great historical drama to express the spirit of sacrifice of the 72 martyrs.

The China Art Drama Troupe, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, and the Guangdong Drama Association initiated a collective performance of the great historical drama "Huanghuagang" on the anniversary of the 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang (March 27) to express the spirit of sacrifice of the 72 martyrs for the revolution. Other drama troupes in Hong Kong and China responded one after another, and within two days, more than 40 units joined, such as the China Travel Drama Troupe, the Times Drama Troupe, the Iron Current Drama Troupe, and the Amateur Drama Troupe. All professional and non-professional drama troupes in Hong Kong and China, as well as drama troupes in schools, have joined, creating the greatest grand occasion in the history of the Hong Kong drama movement. After several meetings, a standing committee has been established to be responsible for the progress of this matter. The standing committee is based on the unit of the troupe and selected the China Art, China Travel, Times, China, Xiangjiang, and Guangdong six drama troupes as standing committee members. Li Hua, representative of China Art, is the secretary, Zhu Baishui, representative of Xiangjiang, is the director of drama affairs,  Jia Bao, representative of China Travel, is in charge of publicity, and the representative of Times is in charge of general affairs. At the same time, Ouyang Yuqian, Tang Huaiqiu, Lu Dun, Li Jingbo, and Hu Chunbing were selected as a five-person director group to execute the "Huanghuagang" (the collective performance of the drama).

It is also heard that all the ticket revenue from the performance on this day will be used to help the refugees.

### A Downtrodden Singer in a Song Hall

— Xiao Cang

Lu Qingyuan, an old actor who recently partnered with Zhang Wenjuan at the Times Theater, is a proud disciple of Wang Changlin. Among the Peking Opera circles in Yanjing, De Zijie (called Ma Dezi by the people) was considered the best in his early years. After De, Zhang Hei and Wang Changlin can be called two difficult ones. Xia Yueheng is also famous. Zhang Hei's martial arts are far superior to Changlin, but he is timid in speech. Changlin's martial arts are slightly inferior, but he is known for his crisp dialogue. In addition to Zhang Hei, Changlin, and Yueheng, there are also Fu Xiaoshan, Lu Qingyuan, Ai Yunfei, Yue Chunlin, and Wang Fushan. Among the younger generation, Ye Shengzhang is now considered an outstanding performer. Lu Qingyuan studied under Changlin, and whatever Changlin can do, Qingyuan can do it too. Around 1914 or 1915, when I was a guest in the old capital, I often saw him performing at the Civilization Garden, partnering with the Yu Zhenting brothers. His dialogue was crisper than Fu Xiaoshan's, because Xiaoshan suffered from shortness of breath when reciting. Later, because his affairs were not liked by his teacher's wife (Changlin's wife), Qingyuan was stubborn and resolutely left Beijing. Before leaving, he told his best friend: "If my teacher does not die, I will not return to Beijing." After coming to Shanghai, he was known as the number one martial arts clown for several years. Whenever a famous baritone from the south performed "Fishing and Killing Home," they were happy to have Qingyuan play the role of the teacher, whose dialogue in this play was exactly the same as Wang Changlin's, without any deviation. His demeanor and posture were also very similar to his teacher. He once co-starred in "San Cha Kou" with Gai Jiaotian and was also famous at the time. Later, due to addiction, his physical strength declined and his martial arts also declined. One year, Yang Xiaolou came to Shanghai and personally visited Qingyuan, telling him that Changlin often thought of him and asked Xiaolou to take him back to the old capital when he returned to Beijing. Qingyuan politely declined. After several years, Qingyuan planned to return home for personal reasons. A famous actor came to Shanghai and said to Qingyuan: "Your teacher is sick in Beijing." Although Qingyuan missed Changlin and wanted to return north to see his teacher, he was afraid that if Changlin died before he returned north, his teacher's wife might say something unfavorable to him, so he decided to stay in Shanghai. After Changlin passed away, Yang Xiaolou sent another letter urging him to go north. At this time, although he was grateful for Xiaolou's kindness, his physical strength had declined. Even if he returned to Beijing, once he took the stage, he would no longer have the spirit of his active years. He had no choice but to reply and thank him. Now Wang Changlin and Yang Xiaolou have passed away, and Qingyuan is also getting old. With Qingyuan's youthful vigor, how could he have expected that he would be down and out in the Times Song Hall today? Several years ago, Mr. Chen Yong'an in Shanghai held a grand regular meeting every summer, hosted by Mr. Jiang Zicheng, who would invite old actors in Shanghai such as Rui Debao, Zhang Rongkui, and Lu Qingyuan to show off their skills. Such a grand occasion can no longer be seen today.

### Recent Events in the Film Industry

— Xin Yan

Yi Hua Company has recently established a relationship with  Industry Bank, and a certain American company has taken over management, so it is expanding significantly. The first blockbuster of this year has been set as "Wang Baochuan." The director is tentatively set as Wu Cun, but Wu is the basic director of Datong Film Studio and is currently being borrowed. It is expected that it will not be difficult to succeed. As for the leading actors, it is rumored to be Hu Die, and some say it is Zhang Cuihong. I don't know which is true.

It is a fact that Wang Yuanlong has joined Xinhua.

Shu Shi has been promoted to the director of drama affairs at Datong Film Studio. It is heard that three new directors will appear at the studio, which is worth noting.

Jin Yan recently played Lin Chong (i.e., "Snowy Night  Revenge Record"), which is directly comparable to the Wu Song he played before. This man is truly a character from Water Margin.

A certain observer said that this year will be the year of the revival of costume dramas, and the output will account for more than 80 percent, which is credible.

### Secret History of the Imperial Court and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (119)

— Xu Muyun

"Linked Rings" is a group play in martial arts dramas.

Tianba felt really ashamed and regretted it very much. He felt unspeakably sad. Fortunately, an old elder brother, Ji Quan, was next to him, hinting to him to kowtow to Brother Zhu to apologize. Seeing that he admitted his guilt and submitted, Guangzu's anger disappeared, and he sincerely advised him: "In the future, you, the deputy general, should be less tempered." In this way, they were able to better understand each other's temperament; and Tianba was willing to correct his mistakes, of course, the friendship became closer. Looking at the people now, nineteen out of ten are greedy for profit and forget righteousness. They are afraid of harm and avoid it as much as possible. How many people are like Zhu Guangzu, willing to hide it from the public and get things done successfully by themselves, and then let their friends know his intentions. In recent society, people talk big first, but nothing actually happens, but they brag about how things will be. When a friend really needs them, they shirk and retreat. Looking at it this way, it is really not as good as the green forest people in the past, who still understood the meaning of righteousness. My personal temperament is very happy to make friends, but I feel that today's friends are extremely difficult to make, because now the word "make" has been changed to "use." Use is only temporary, or once or twice. After using each other, the friendship ends. Therefore, whenever I see plays like "Linked Rings" and "Copper Net Formation," I feel a sense of emotion. The word "righteousness" in the new life's rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame certainly includes a wide range, but the four words "valuing righteousness in making friends" are certainly included in it. Many people's views on "Linked Rings" are all focused on Bao and Huang, but my personal opinion is that I admire Zhu Guangzu's courage and thoughtful consideration. He secretly thought that their Third Uncle Huang (San Tai) had superb martial arts in those years. With his ability, he almost lost to Bao Erdun in the martial arts competition at Li Family Shop; if he hadn't changed his consistent principle of not fighting secretly and secretly released a whip, injuring Bao Erdun's left arm, I am afraid that he would have failed in all likelihood. Tianba's ability is not comparable to his father's, and Bao Erdun will definitely practice hard to avenge the whip he received in those years. Although he is slightly older in recent years, he is a famous "Iron Arhat" and is not like other flower-picking thieves who are old, weak, and whose martial arts have declined. If Tianba cannot win, he will have to fulfill his promise to admit guilt for his father.
