Editorial

### Great Victory in Northern Jiangxi

Over the past ten days, the Chinese forces in northern Jiangxi have achieved unprecedented victories: recapturing Gao'an, Dacheng, and encircling Nanchang, Fengxin, and Wuning. These victories can, in military terms, disrupt the Japanese army's established plan to invade Zhuzhou and Changsha from the west, and shatter its dreams of splitting the Third and Ninth War Zones. In political terms, they can eliminate the surrender theories of the puppets and strengthen the belief that victory in the war of resistance is certain. This will become the death knell of the total collapse of the Japanese invasion of China, and also the prelude to China's final victory.

Originally, after capturing Nanchang, the Japanese army concentrated heavy troops in northern Jiangxi, planning to invade Hunan in two ways: one through Dacheng and Gao'an, along the highway to Wanzai and Pingxiang, and directly to Zhuzhou; the other using Wuning as a base, moving along the Xiu River towards Tongshan and Tongcheng in southern Hubei, and taking Changsha via Pingjiang. However, the terrain of Jiangxi Province is low in the north and high in the south, making it easy to attack but difficult to defend. When the Japanese army attacked Nanchang, it failed to first secure strong bases on both sides of Poyang Lake. Its isolated forces advanced deep, taking a dangerous gamble, and had already placed themselves in a desperate situation of being surrounded and annihilated. How could it still use Nanchang as a base for invading Hunan? As expected, after the Chinese forces withdrew from Nanchang in a planned manner, they used active tactics and counterattacked in multiple ways: the southern route recaptured Gao'an and Dacheng, encircling Nanchang and Fengxin, cutting off one arm of the Japanese army invading Hunan Province; the northern route surrounded Wuning, preventing the Japanese army from advancing westward; at the same time, the Chinese forces in southern Hubei also recovered Tongshan, cutting off the Japanese army's route to invade Hunan from southern Hubei. These not only exposed the emptiness of the Japanese military deployment for invading Hunan, but also showed that the Chinese army has gradually gained the initiative. If the Japanese army cannot reoccupy the above-mentioned strongholds, its attempt to invade Hunan cannot be realized.

Secondly, when the Japanese army attacked Nanchang, it held a fantasy that after capturing Nanchang, it could separate the Third War Zone and the Ninth War Zone, so that the Third War Zone would be completely isolated, and the Chinese army in that war zone would be easily annihilated, the threat to the areas of Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou could be reduced, and further, it could cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is the economic artery of southeastern China and an important transportation route between the southeast and the southwest. Once it is cut off, China's strength for resisting the war will be greatly affected. But fantasy is ultimately a fantasy and cannot become a reality. Now that the Chinese forces have recaptured Nanchang, this fantasy has been completely shattered.

Since the Chinese forces began their counteroffensive, good news has been frequently reported, and more than seventy lost territories have been recovered. However, the recapture of an important stronghold like Nanchang is of particular significance. Because when the Chinese forces previously withdrew from Nanchang in a planned manner, those who only believed in weapons and those who were not firm in their belief in the war of resistance thought that the Chinese forces were forced to withdraw, not because of strategic reasons. Their belief in the certainty of victory in the war of resistance was even shaken. Therefore, Japan took advantage of this weakness and used the mouthpiece of the puppets to spread many inducement theories in order to disperse China's strength for resisting the war and achieve its conspiracy of a quick peace. Now, this conspiracy has also been shattered by the hundreds of thousands of brave warriors counterattacking in northern Jiangxi. At the same time, it has been confirmed that the previous withdrawal of the Chinese forces from Nanchang was indeed planned. Its purpose was, on the one hand, to avoid excessive losses of strength, and on the other hand, to lure the Japanese army to go deep so as to give it a heavy blow. Therefore, before it was occupied, the Chinese forces first gave it a fierce blow, exhausting its strength as much as possible; after it was occupied, they gave it a fierce encirclement around it, weakening the Japanese army's strength; finally, taking advantage of its unstable footing, they immediately counterattacked. Therefore, this great victory in northern Jiangxi not only awakened the illusions of those who only believe in weapons and those who doubt the certainty of victory in the war of resistance, but also eliminated the theories of compromise and surrender, and strengthened the courage of the whole country to resist the war.

### In the Past Twenty Days, More Than 10,000 Japanese Soldiers Invading Shanxi Province Have Been Annihilated. The Chinese Army Has Repeatedly Achieved Major Victories. The Battles at Fushan and Jicheng Were the Fiercest.

Xingji: Since the Chinese troops in the Zhongtiao Mountains and east of the Tongpu Railway launched their attacks, they have been fighting fiercely for more than twenty days. They have attacked Fushan, Yicheng, Jiangxian, Wenxi, Xiaxian, Zhangdian, and strongholds such as Yuncheng, Jiexian, Congshan Zhang Village in the south, and Ershiling. They have repeatedly achieved major victories, especially in Fushan, Yicheng, and the area north and south of Yanzhang southeast of Wenxi. Hua Peng Zhenpu, the commander of the regiment, died in battle north of Fushan, and Zhang Zhenqi, the commander of the regiment, was wounded near Shicun in Yicheng. The bravery of the Chinese officers and soldiers in annihilating the enemy can be seen from this. According to statistics, the Japanese casualties are over 7,000. There are many wounded soldiers gathered in Anyi, Houma, and Linfen. More than 1,000 Japanese corpses were transported north from Wenxi on the 20th. Currently, there are 5,000 to 6,000 Japanese reinforcements in Linfen, and 4,000 to 5,000 Japanese reinforcements in Fushan and Quwo, separately increasing the forces in Yicheng and Wenxi. They are currently engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army. In Yuncheng, the Japanese army is stubbornly resisting in its strongholds. The Chinese side is using strong troops to enter and exit the railway and launch flanking attacks. In the first ten days of the month, more than 8,000 Japanese soldiers advanced south along the northern section of the Baijin Highway. After the Chinese army encircled and attacked them successively at Fenshuling, Zhangdian, north of the highway, and east of Gucheng and Shipan, one-fourth of them were killed or wounded (i.e., more than 2,000 people). The defeated Japanese army fled through Nanguan Town and continued to scatter east of Zihongkou. On the evening of the 21st, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the town, broke through two barbed wire fences, captured two bunkers, and annihilated more than 50 Japanese soldiers guarding the town, seizing twelve machine guns and rifles. By this point, the Japanese army's attempt to invade southeastern Shanxi in separate routes was completely crushed. In recent weeks, the Japanese army has reinforced its forces from Linfen by more than one division. Currently, there are 4,000 to 5,000 Japanese soldiers stationed in Jiangxian. The Japanese army in Yongji and Fenglingdu seems to be withdrawing northwards. However, the Japanese army on the Zhengtai Railway has recently suspended passenger transport. It is rumored that a large number of Japanese puppet troops will be transferred from the Northeast to reinforce Pu. A major battle in southern Shanxi is brewing. In total, in the past twenty days, the Japanese army has suffered 7,000 casualties in southern Shanxi and 2,000 in eastern Shanxi. Including the enemy annihilated in the Jinli Highway, Heilongguan, Jingle, Fenxi, Hongzhao, Huo and other places in western Shanxi, the number should be around 10,000. (Dispatch of the 27th)

Xingji: The Japanese army in the southern section of the Tongpu Railway has repeatedly reinforced its troops and launched unsuccessful attacks, suffering heavy losses in the triangular area of southern Shanxi, which is unprecedented in the past two months. It is reported that Japanese officers Ushijima and Hirayama have been reprimanded and are planning another large-scale invasion. There are still constant contacts on both sides of Linfen. Most of the Japanese troops in Linfen have been transferred south, and there are only more than 2,000 remaining. The Japanese troops in Fushan and Anze have increased. More than 500 Japanese soldiers in Fushan, under the cover of artillery fire, advanced towards Mijia Yuan (southeast of Fushan) on the morning of the 24th. The Chinese army intercepted them on a certain high ground and engaged in a chaotic battle for a long time, defeating the Japanese army. Currently, there are more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers in Fushan, mostly near the east of the city, confronting the Chinese army. Japanese officer Yoneda Akihiro was killed by the Chinese army in a chaotic battle near Anze a few days ago. There are currently 700 to 800 Japanese infantry and cavalry in Heilongguan. The Japanese army has been annihilated by the Chinese army for more than 400 people in recent days. They are currently holding their strongholds and dare not attack. The battle in the area north of Linfen and south of Lingshi has turned silent. The Japanese plan to build roads, but they dare not start construction due to the surveillance of the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Fenxi plans to cooperate with the battle on the Heilongguan side and has repeatedly increased its troops. On the morning of the 25th, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers advanced south towards Heping in two groups. They engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army for several hours in the area of Yumei, Mazhuang, and Liujiagou. Due to the Japanese having more soldiers while the Chinese had fewer, Heping was invaded by the Japanese. The battle situation in southern Shanxi is still fierce in the fierce battles around Suicun. The Japanese main force has been repeatedly defeated and is very panicked. 2,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry and 6 to 7 artillery pieces from Yuncheng and Wan Quan led by Gou gathered and advanced towards Gouxi Wangjiazhuang (southwest of Jiwang Mountain) in four routes on the 24th. The artillery fire from both sides was extremely fierce, and they fought fiercely for six hours, planning to engage in a decisive battle with the Chinese army. The Chinese army knew the Japanese tricks, so they sneaked to the mountain tops and engaged in mobile warfare with the Japanese. A certain Chinese unit engaged in fierce battles with more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers in Wangtong Village (northwest of Yuncheng) for a day and night on the evening of the 25th, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army in Wan Quan successively rushed to reinforce them. The Chinese units have established close contact with each other and are attacking the Japanese. Most of the Japanese troops in Xinjiang and Houma are reinforcing Aikou. A certain Chinese unit is intercepting them separately. There has only been small contact in the areas of Wenxi, Hejin, and Jishan, and there have been no major changes. (Dispatch of the 28th)

Tongguan: Since the Chinese troops in southern Shanxi recovered Wenxi, Shuyan, Yanzhang, Xiangshan, and other places, the Japanese army has reinforced its troops by more than 3,000, and the fierce battles with the Chinese have been extremely intense for days. The Japanese Kobayashi regiment has been annihilated by the Chinese army by more than two-thirds. (Dispatch of the 28th)

### The Japanese Are Transferring Troops from Zhangjiakou to Help in Baotou

The Chinese attack troops have separately approached Liangcheng, Saxian, Guyang, and the Kundulun River west of Baotou, and are launching attacks on the Japanese. (Dispatch of the 28th)

Wuyuan: The Chinese troops in eastern Sui were ordered to carry out guerrilla warfare at the junction of Fengzhen and Liangcheng on the evening of the 24th, to contain the Japanese army. They encountered more than 200 puppet Mongol soldiers near Dahaiwan. Because the Japanese army was quite rampant, the Chinese army used a part of its cavalry to outflank them and cut off the Japanese army's retreat. The Japanese army panicked and fled. The Chinese army took the initiative to attack and drove the Japanese army into the Dahaitan, and occupied Gaokou, launching a fierce attack on the Japanese army in the water. More than half of the Japanese army drowned or were injured. Subsequently, more than 20 trucks with several artillery pieces rushed to reinforce them from Fengzhen, bombarding the Chinese army. The Chinese army, having completed its mission, retreated safely. (Dispatch of the 26th)

The contact point of these two railways was originally in Zhengzhou, but because the Japanese army was ultimately unable to capture Zhengzhou, this new railway line was built to replace it. It is reported that this light railway from Xinxiang to Kaifeng is 80 kilometers long and has a wooden bridge built over the Yellow River. It was originally scheduled to open on May 5th, but yesterday, the Chinese guerrillas near Kaifeng suddenly set fire to the wooden bridge with swift action and destroyed all the nearby rails. Therefore, the Japanese plan to open the railway on May 5th has now been abandoned. (Quick News Agency Dispatch of the 28th)

### Pittman Suggests Economic Sanctions Against Japan, Authorizing the President to Restrict Trade with Japan to Make Up for the Deficiencies of the New Neutrality Law

(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday proposed another legislative bill. This bill authorizes the President to restrict commercial trade with countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty and the United States. In other words, it authorizes the President to ban trade with Japan. Pittman proposed this new bill to make up for the shortcomings of the cash-and-carry provisions in the revised Neutrality Law. At the same time, the proposal stipulates that in order to implement this bill, the President may issue a declaration to Congress before submitting the bill, which will take effect ten days later. According to Pittman's statement to the Associated Press reporter today, the passage of this bill is necessary for the government to deal with Japan's restrictions on American expatriates in China. Japan has made a sacred promise to respect the Nine-Power Treaty, but since Japan's invasion of China, it has not only endangered the lives of American people, but also violated the safeguards of the Nine-Power Treaty and restricted the rights and interests of American expatriates. Every protest made by the American government to Japan has been ineffective. This proposal authorizes the President with considerable power, which may enable the President to reach an understanding with Japan. According to Pittman's proposal, the President is to take measures against Japan by means short of war. Because the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has repeatedly held meetings, it has been argued that special clauses should be established in the Far East, as cash-and-carry only benefits Britain and France, which control the seas, while only Japan controls the seas in the Far East, which will benefit the aggressor. According to Congressional sources, the proposal by Pittman has come at an opportune time. However, it is difficult to determine whether the President will announce the severance of trade relations with Japan in the near future. It is generally expected that the President will still give Japan a final chance, and will give the final chance to the opening of the Yangtze River and the occupied areas of Japan, as well as the anti-foreign financial policies implemented by Japan in China, so that there will be room for maneuver. At present, the United States and Japan are already in a state of suspended trade, so if there is no satisfactory solution to the Japanese issue, a trade break between the United States and Japan is highly possible. In addition, when the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting, Republican Congressman Goyer asked for the prompt adoption of a measure authorizing the President to lift the arms export ban to the invaded countries. He said, "If we continue to supply countries that violate treaties, we will be helping the wicked and increasing the power of future enemies." It is found that Goyer is quite influential in the Republican Party. This statement shows that the bill proposed by Democrat Pittman will definitely be supported by the Republican Party. In addition, the chairman of the World Religious Peace Conference, Chu Shi, requested President Roosevelt to convene a conference of signatories to the Non-War Pact as soon as possible. Chu Shi said, "We cannot avoid war everywhere, we must find ways to eliminate war. If the United States had taken concrete action against Japan immediately when Japan invaded Manchuria on September 18, the aggression against China by Japan would not have happened again." In addition, Professor Flemming of Vanderbilt University asked Congress to recall the American ambassador to Japan and increase loans to China. In addition, Goyer advocated adopting the amendment by Mr. Thomas to prohibit the supply of major raw materials or military raw materials to Japan. He said that after the implementation of this bill, it could immediately affect the situation in the Far East and prevent the United States from being involved in the war. Because Japan is currently unable to take care of China, it is not a problem for the United States to take retaliatory actions against Japan's undermining of American interests in the East, and it can promote the early end of Japan's aggression.

### China Orders 79 Aircraft from the United States, Price 15 Million US Dollars, Contract Signed with Many Styles

(Washington) According to reliable sources here today, a contract for China to purchase 15 million US dollars of military aircraft has been signed. The party handling this matter is the China Aviation Power Company (i.e., the representative of Chinese aircraft procurement in the United States). Although the counterparty to the contract is the United Aircraft Corporation of the United States, it includes many styles. The United Aircraft Corporation is in fact the general manager of various aircraft factories in the United States. The contract stipulates that the US side will submit 79 light bombers and fighters in April. As for the 15 million US dollars, it will be paid with silver shipped from China to the United States, without using US government loans. Among these 79 aircraft, there are 27 light bombers and 52 high-speed Safersky aircraft. The Chinese side is currently seeking to order another radio contract here, so that 250 aircraft can be equipped with wireless telephone equipment, costing 300,000 US dollars. It is reported that the value of the silver shipped from China to the United States was 1.3 million US dollars in mid-March. According to this rate, the aircraft payment can be cleared within October. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 28th)

### Hitler Gave a Speech, Refuting Roosevelt's Various Proposals, Announcing the Abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty

(Berlin) Leader Hitler recently gave a long speech in the House of Representatives at noon today, responding to the telegram from US President Roosevelt. The main points are as follows: (1) Germany is willing to provide guarantees to the countries mentioned by President Roosevelt under mutual conditions. (2) The Anglo-German Naval Agreement is declared abolished. (3) Germany demands the return of its old colonies, but this is not enough to constitute a reason for war. (4) The German-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty no longer exists. (5) The guarantees provided by Germany for the existing borders between Germany and France will still be honored. (6) Germany hopes that the volunteers in the Spanish territory will be able to return to their country after participating in the National Army's triumphal entry into Madrid. (Havas Dispatch of the 28th)

(Berlin) Leader Hitler delivered a speech this afternoon, replying to President Roosevelt, and resolutely announced to the world that Germany has abolished the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and believes that the German-Polish Agreement concluded in 1934 no longer exists. However, Germany is prepared to negotiate with Britain and Poland on the relevant issues. Between Germany and France, there are no more territorial issues hindering them since Germany recovered Saar. Germany only asks for the return of its colonies to Britain. As for the German volunteers in the Spanish territory, they will return to Germany after the National Army triumphantly enters Madrid, which is not a problem.

### Hitler's Speech Stance

Hitler, after briefly stating his attitude towards European politics, turned his spear to criticize President Roosevelt's telegram, saying that no fewer than fourteen wars have occurred in the world since 1918, and Germany has not participated in them. Therefore, Roosevelt should not make appeals to Germany on moral grounds. Criticizing other countries without solid evidence not only disrupts the order of the world, but also hinders world peace. Hitler then traced back the disappointment of the German people with Wilson's Fourteen Points, saying that Germany will never send representatives to participate in international conferences similar to the court in the future. As for Roosevelt's request for Germany to announce its future policies, he rejected it, saying that he is only responsible to the German people and not to others. However, President Roosevelt pointed out the countries threatened by Germany. He has separately consulted the opinions of the countries. Are they feeling threatened? Are they authorizing Roosevelt to come out with this? The replies from the countries all said no, and a few replies were sternly rejected. The truth of this matter is self-evident. As for the rumors that Germany has plans to invade American territory, they are unfounded and completely untrustworthy. In short, since the National Socialist Party came to power, Germany has repeatedly proposed proposals to limit armaments, all of which have been rejected. However, Germany's desire for peace has not disappeared.

### Hitler Never Forgets: The Crimes of the Treaty of Versailles

Hitler, at the outset, addressed President Roosevelt's appeal, stating, "The outlandish content of the telegram from the American President to me is well known to you. In fact, before I even received it, its propaganda through radio and newspapers had already made it known worldwide. At the same time, countless commentaries in the newspapers of democratic nations seemed intended to make us understand that this telegram was a clever and intelligent document presented to a nation responsible for taking war measures. Since assuming power, my sole purpose has been to restore the freedom of the German nation, and I seek nothing else. What I strive for is only to recover what was previously taken from us by force. Today's Greater Germany does not include any ancient non-German territory. In other words, before white men discovered the American continent, Germany's territory was not only the same as today but even larger, as several provinces and regions were later lost. Logically, all those who faithfully fulfill their duty by fighting for their country and nation should enjoy a reasonable and just peace. But the reality is far from this; millions have been deceived by peace. This is the calamity of the Treaty of Versailles for Germans and other allied forces. The Treaty of Versailles is the crystallization of jealousy, hatred, and unreasonableness. As a result, 115 million people were deprived of their right to national self-determination, separated from their homeland, and arbitrarily merged into new entities by crazed politicians, not by victorious soldiers, regardless of their bloodline, economic life, and other factors, leading to tragic consequences. The so-called politicians of the democratic empires at the time regarded themselves as dictators of a new world order, presumptuously assuming the responsibility of resolving issues among nations. When this new order faced crisis, European and American politicians each withdrew and shirked responsibility, blaming each other to avoid historical judgment. In fact, the countries that brought disaster to our nation are countless, seizing all its colonies and exploiting all its financial resources, driving our country into the most tragic and dark era." (28th, Hai Tong Telegraph)

Copenhagen, Denmark: Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, en route back to his post from Moscow, told reporters here that if Western democracies were attacked, the Soviet Union would be willing to assist with aircraft and munitions. The Soviet government has already sent this proposal to London and is now awaiting a response. (28th, Hai Tong Telegraph)

### Churchill's Swift Words: Hitler's Speech Not Worth Attention

(London) During today's debate in the House of Commons on the conscription bill, Churchill, who served as First Lord of the Admiralty during the European War, delivered a speech endorsing the implementation of conscription. He stated that this was purely a British plan and not a result of Hitler's speech tomorrow. The speech is of no importance. If it contains threatening words, the situation is already bad and will not worsen because of it. If it contains words of reassurance, they cannot be believed without factual proof. If his words are entirely abusive, then why should we pay attention to them? (27th, Reuters)

### Germany's Situation: Strong Exterior, Weak Interior

(Berlin) German newspapers all claim that Britain's encirclement policy has failed and that Germany's diplomatic policies toward Yugoslavia and Romania have been successful. Furthermore, leaders of the National Socialist Party have given speeches, asserting that the natural aspirations of the German nation can be satisfied without resorting to war and that the spirit of Germany's rapid progress cannot be obstructed. While these words are pleasing to the ear, the people still feel uneasy about the current situation, believing that the situation of the Third Reich today is far inferior to that of the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires in 1914. As the attitude of various democratic countries has become stronger, it is no longer possible for Germany to win over Poland and Turkey and conclude alliances with them. The future situation is indeed not optimistic. (28th, Havas)

### London Market: Very Good Reaction

(London) The initial reaction in Britain to Hitler's speech has been very good. Stock prices in the stock market, such as military bonds, have all risen. (28th, Associated Press)

### Britain Aims to Encircle Germany: Naval Agreement Should Be Abolished

Hitler then commented on Anglo-German relations, saying, "I have always advocated amicable relations and increased cooperation between Britain and Germany. There is no doubt that the British Empire has made significant contributions to human culture and economic life. I admire the achievements of the Anglo-Saxons in colonial endeavors. However, unless the Anglo-Saxons respect not only the interests of the British Empire but also acknowledge the interests of the German people, friendship between us Germans and Anglo-Saxons will be impossible to maintain. 'Those who respect others are always respected by others.' I heard that the British Prime Minister stated that he could no longer trust Germany's assurances in the future. If so, I will no longer hope that he personally or the British people will maintain the concept of mutual trust. When the National Socialist Party came to power, for the sake of promoting amicable relations between Britain and Germany, I suggested automatically limiting German naval armaments. However, this limitation had an important condition: the confidence that there would be no more wars between Britain and Germany. Until now, my confidence remains, but Britain's confidence has been shaken. Opinions in London mostly believe that if Germany clashes with other countries in the future, Britain will stand in opposition to Germany. Not only are private opinions like this, but newspaper editorials and even official statements believe that Britain must be hostile to Germany and implement a policy of encirclement. In that case, the foundation of the naval agreement has been removed. How can I remain silent and watch? Therefore, today, I wish to express my views to the British government: if the British government is willing to negotiate this matter with Germany again, I am still happy to do so to obtain a clear and straightforward understanding. We Germans, driven by a sense of self-respect, cannot avoid naval armament competition."

### The Danzig Problem Must Be Solved: Poland Rejected Proposals

Hitler then discussed the importance of economic agreements Germany has concluded with other countries, stating that Germany is the largest consumer for various small countries and does not intend to use commercial treaties to bring these small countries into the political sphere.

Regarding Germany's relations with Poland, even though Germany was wounded after the war, it still concluded a treaty of friendship with Poland. The treaty eased tensions in Europe, but there remains an issue between Germany and Poland that must be resolved sooner or later: the issue of the Free City of Danzig. I believe that if this issue can be resolved peacefully, it would make a significant contribution to the European situation. After months of negotiations, a proposal was presented to the Polish government several months ago, the contents of which are distributed as follows:

(1) The City of Danzig returns to Germany, becoming a Free State within German territory.

(2) Germany accepts the route of the Polish Corridor and can build railways there, enjoying the same extraterritorial rights as Poland.

At the same time, the German side proposed five conditions in exchange:

(1) Recognition of all of Poland's economic rights in Danzig.

(2) Poland enjoys a free port of any size in Danzig to fully maintain maritime traffic.

(3) Recognition that the German-Polish border is the final border.

(4) Conclusion of a 25-year non-aggression treaty with Poland, longer than my own life.

(5) A joint guarantee of Slovakia by Germany, Poland, and Hungary to avoid Germany's unilateral hegemony. However, the Polish government rejected the proposal, only expressing (1) willingness to discuss the issue of the League of Nations commissioner for the City of Danzig, and (2) consideration of transportation facilitation in the Polish Corridor. I deeply regret this attitude of the Polish government. However, it is not yet a decisive matter. The worst part is that Poland mistakenly believed in an international movement imitating what Czechoslovakia did a year ago, mobilizing troops to confront Germany. Hence, there were proposals for security guarantees and the conclusion of mutual assistance treaties. If an international conflict occurs from now on, Poland will then attack Germany. This naturally deviates greatly from the spirit of the non-aggression pact that I concluded with the late Polish President Marshal Piłsudski in 1934. Therefore, I believe that the German-Polish non-aggression pact has ceased to exist due to Poland's unilateral violation. However, I reiterate that if Poland is willing to abide by the above principles and re-conclude a new agreement with Germany to adjust relations between the two countries, I would still welcome it.

### Annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia: Merits and Demerits to be Judged by Future Generations

Hitler then recounted Germany's humiliation and economic ruin, stating, "Today, we already know the reasons for the cruel consequences of this great war. In short, it can be summed up as: destroying other countries. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to (1) deprive Germany of its colonies, (2) abuse the nation, preventing it from rising up against the trampling of the oppressors, (3) impose economic chains, making it impossible for Germany to repay reparations for a century, and (4) most shamefully, dissolve the German nation and divide its political regions. I have repeatedly stated that it is impossible to obtain a harmonious solution if European countries do not respect the principle of national self-determination and disregard political and economic needs. I have further stated that even revising the Treaty of Versailles cannot fully satisfy everyone, as there are many territories that can cause disputes. Therefore, I made a final decision. I did not do as France did from 1870 to 1871, declaring the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine as intolerable. However, I will treat Saar and these two provinces separately. After the return of Saar to Germany, the territorial issues between Germany and France in Europe have been resolved. I have also issued binding declarations to several European countries, namely the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, etc., whose replies all stated their willingness to maintain absolute neutrality, which deeply gratified and pleased the German government. There is no need to dwell on our country's close ties with Italy, and we also have friendly relations with Hungary and Yugoslavia." Hitler then recounted the background and motivations for the annexation of Austria, the recovery of the Sudetenland, the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and the retrieval of Memel, and mentioned that in the days before the split of Czechoslovakia, Britain and France had requested Germany to guarantee the integrity of Czechoslovakia, but Germany was unwilling to promise a guarantee. This was because there was a large stockpile of munitions in Central Europe at that time, and in case of misuse, a wildfire could erupt. For example, there were 1,592 aircraft, 501 anti-aircraft guns, 2,175 light and heavy machine guns, 1.09 million rifles, 100 million rounds of ammunition, and 3 million artillery shells in Czechoslovakia. After detailing the above figures, Hitler said with emotion, "Whether Germany's handling of this matter, resolving the danger, is meritorious or flawed, and what the gains and losses are, will be known in the future. There is no need to dwell on it. What can be asserted at present is that Britain has no right to monitor or comment on Bohemia and Moravia, just as Britain's measures in Ireland, regardless of whether they are right or wrong, will not be subject to German monitoring or comment."

Hitler further stated, "What I particularly do not understand is Britain's attempt to bind Germany's actions with the Munich Agreement. The agreement between Chamberlain and me in Munich certainly involved the mutual relationship between Britain and Germany, but it is impractical and rigid to assume that all of Germany's political actions in the future can be measured by the yardstick of this agreement. It is like saying that Britain must consult with Britain first if it wants to take any measures in Palestine or elsewhere. If Mr. Chamberlain now believes that the Munich Agreement has been abolished, we can certainly act accordingly."

### Poland Prepared to Negotiate with Germany

Warsaw: Major Polish newspapers, including those related to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have been successively publishing reports that Poland is prepared to discuss the Danzig issue with Germany. Surprise has been expressed in diplomatic and political circles here. Political observers believe that the publication of this news by Polish newspapers during Hitler's speech is particularly important. (28th, Associated Press)

Warsaw: According to the Polish government's newspaper, Wiesol Porgd, Poland currently has an armed force of one million men, with an original standing army of 400,000 and an additional 600,000 reservists mobilized four weeks ago, bringing the current troop strength to one million. (28th, Hai Tong Telegraph)

### Listing Various Points to Refute Roosevelt: Refusing to Declare Future Policies

Hitler then returned to Roosevelt's telegram, stating, "Today's global unease is entirely due to the machinations of international warmongers. In fact, between 1919 and 1938, there were 14 international wars, none of which involved Germany. During the same period, there were 26 instances of violent intervention and armed bloody sanctions, in which Germany also never participated. The United States itself participated in six military interventions, and the Soviet Union participated in a total of ten instances of war, intervention, and sanctions. Therefore, I believe that what Mr. Roosevelt called 'the current world's fear of war' is not due to actual wars but is due to malicious propaganda in newspapers, causing artificial terror. I believe that if the responsible governments of various countries can control their newspapers, carefully publishing information on relations between countries and foreign events, the terror of war can be immediately eliminated. That is the first point. Mr. Roosevelt believes that any great war will inevitably lead to serious and tragic consequences. The reply is that Germans are most deeply aware of this, but I do not believe that any war will have tragic consequences for the entire world unless the entire world concludes treaties, forms organizations, and is drawn into the vortex. That is the second point. As for Mr. Roosevelt's statement that he has repeatedly appealed to Hitler, I have also repeatedly requested the peaceful resolution of international problems. That is the third point. Regarding Mr. Roosevelt's compassion for the loss of independence of three European countries and one African country, I do not know who the so-called three European countries that have lost their independence are. It should be known that these countries were established in 1918 completely against the will of the people. How can Mr. Roosevelt be ignorant of this historical error? That is the fourth point. As for Mr. Roosevelt's statement that this appeal is entirely a loud call for the welfare of humanity, the reply is, 'If this call from the United States had been made at the right time, Germany would not have suffered from the Treaty of Versailles.' That is the fifth point. Mr. Roosevelt believes that international problems can be resolved by international conferences. This is completely wrong. The League of Nations has failed to resolve any problems in twenty years. What other international conferences are not merely formalities? International problems must be resolved by national strength, not by conference tables. That is the sixth point. Regarding Mr. Roosevelt's statement that the success of a conference must be conditional on the good faith of both parties, the reply can be, 'Germany will never participate in any international conferences similar to courts in the future.' That is the seventh point. As for Mr. Roosevelt's statement that if I issue a frank statement about Germany's future policies, it would greatly benefit international peace, the reply can be, 'I cannot make any declarations to anyone other than the German people.' That is the eighth point. And if Germany and Italy ask the United States to explain its foreign policy toward Central and South America, what will the United States do? That is the ninth point. As for what Mr. Roosevelt said about various small countries feeling threatened by Germany, after Germany inquired, the countries all gave negative answers. That is the tenth point. Regarding Mr. Roosevelt's inquiry about disarmament, Hitler first pointed out that between 1919 and 1923, the Allied Commission had proven that Germany had fully fulfilled the conditions of disarmament. The Treaty of Versailles stipulated general disarmament for all countries in the world. Germany's disarmament action had been completed, but other countries increased armaments and turned a deaf ear to Germany's appeals and suggestions. Until 1934, Germany had no choice but to rearm. That is the eleventh point. Regarding Mr. Roosevelt's inquiry about Germany's guarantee to participate in trade discussions, the reply is, 'The cessation of boycott movements and the removal of trade barriers are prerequisites.' That is the twelfth point."

After replying to Roosevelt's inquiries point by point, Hitler made the following suggestions to Roosevelt: please implement Wilson's Fourteen Points and restore Germany's stolen territories. Hitler stated that a head of state is responsible for the fate of humanity, and he sympathizes with Roosevelt, but the wealth and population density of Germany and the United States are vastly different. Hitler takes Germany's welfare as a prerequisite, while Roosevelt can take the whole world as a prerequisite, as the United States has more raw materials and property.

Hitler's final words were, "My efforts for Germany's justice, welfare, progress, and peace are efforts for the justice, welfare, progress, and peace of all mankind." (28th, Hai Tong Telegraph)

### The United States Does Not Consider Hitler's Speech a Formal Reply

(Washington) Diplomatic circles here recently declared that after President Roosevelt issued a telegram, according to diplomatic etiquette, German leader Hitler should have replied with a telegram and should not have merely delivered a speech. Therefore, the US authorities do not consider Hitler's speech today as a reply and do not need to make any formal expression. As of now, President Roosevelt does not intend to send a second telegram to Hitler, and US Ambassador to Germany Wilson has no plans to return to his post. Only after Hitler clearly replies on the matter of non-aggression against European countries will the US State Department consider everything and make a decision. (28th, Havas)

### British and French Ambassadors Did Not Attend: Representatives Attended Instead

(New York) According to The New York Times, when President Roosevelt presides over the opening ceremony of the New York World's Fair next Sunday, he may deliver a speech replying to Hitler's declaration in Congress today. Mr. Roosevelt's speech has extreme political significance. (28th, Hai Tong Telegraph)

(Berlin) According to the latest impressions obtained here, the speech that Hitler will deliver tomorrow is not a war speech. All parties who know the content of the speech claim that there is nothing too surprising in it. It is heard that British Ambassador to Germany Henderson has decided not to attend the German Congress to listen but will have Forbes, the counselor of the British Embassy, attend on his behalf. It is expected that the French Embassy will do the same. The United States will be represented by its chargé d'affaires. (27th, Reuters)

(Berlin) People in Berlin are eagerly awaiting the speech that Head of State Hitler will deliver in Congress this afternoon in response to US President Roosevelt, considering it a major event. A few minutes before Mr. Hitler's speech, all work in Germany, except for a very few that are absolutely impossible to stop, completely ceased in order to listen to this extensive speech. Loudspeakers have been installed in all cities, towns, villages, and stations throughout the country. The Congress is surrounded by soldiers and police, with special security measures in place. This morning, Berlin newspapers published news of various countries' expectations for Mr. Hitler's speech with huge headlines. (28th, Hai Tong Telegraph)

### Anti-Aggression Front Issue: Britain Re-Proposes Suggestions to Russia

Easing the Opposition of Poland and Romania: Russian Ambassador to the UK Returns to Post to Continue Negotiations

(London) After London authorities completed their study of the Soviet proposal, Anglo-Soviet talks have already progressed to a deeper stage. According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the British government has instructed its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, to present some observations and suggestions to the Soviet government. It is heard that the British government is now anxious to ascertain what attitude the Soviet Union will take toward assisting any neighboring country that requests aid due to aggression. Some quarters believe that the countries concerned may hint that the assistance needed is naval, land, and air forces, or the supply of military goods. The British side is still maintaining silence on the content of the talks, but discerning observers generally believe that if this arrangement is implemented, countries unwilling to acknowledge accepting full Soviet military assistance or forming a concrete alliance with the Soviet Union will inevitably express opposition. Soviet Ambassador Maisky's return to his post today will facilitate Britain's completion of this talk. (28th, Reuters)

Copenhagen, Finland: Extremely reliable news has recently been received here, claiming that the Soviet government warned Latvia and Estonia earlier this month, stating that if those countries were to abandon their sovereignty, the Soviet Union would not consider the non-aggression treaties concluded with those countries (established in July 1933) effective for its own interests. The governments of Latvia and Estonia have replied that they will never abandon their sovereignty. Knowledgeable sources here have recently commented that after Hungary joined the Anti-Comintern Pact in February of this year, the Soviet Union used the excuse that the country was relying on Germany and severed diplomatic relations with it. The so-called abandonment of sovereignty probably refers to throwing oneself into Germany's embrace, intending to prevent it, and at the same time hinting to other countries not to succumb to Germany. (27th, Havas)

(Paris) Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky returned to his country a few days ago to report on his duties and contacted the government authorities there on the issue of organizing an anti-aggression group. He then hastened back to his post and passed through here this afternoon, holding talks with Soviet Ambassador to France Suritz, informing him of the progress of Anglo-Soviet talks and the Soviet authorities' views on the matter. (27th, Havas)

Copenhagen, Denmark: Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky, flying from Moscow to London, told a newspaper reporter here this morning that "if Western European countries are attacked, the Soviet Union is prepared to provide munitions and assistance. This has been proposed to Britain and we are now awaiting their reply." (27th, Havas)

(Moscow) After the British government decided to implement conscription, Soviet political figures have all expressed their welcome and stated that Britain and France's attitude toward the various dictatorships has become stronger. It is hoped that they can maintain this. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, seeing that Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin has gone to the capital of Turkey, it is known that the negotiations between the Soviet and Turkish countries on organizing a collective security system have made good progress. Potemkin also took the opportunity to make a brief stay in the capital of Bulgaria at the request of Bulgarian Minister Antonov, which also shows the harmony of Soviet-Bulgarian relations. Even though Bulgaria has been wooed by Germany and Italy, it has not abandoned its neutral attitude, which can be clearly proven here. (27th, Havas)

Istanbul: Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Potemkin arrived here today and will discuss the issue of Black Sea defense with Turkish authorities. Once the talks are concluded, he will depart for Bulgaria and Romania. The Soviet side hopes that the result of Mr. Potemkin's talks will be the formation of a strong Black Sea defense pact.

### Closer Relations between Germany and Yugoslavia

Yugoslav Foreign Minister Leaves Germany for Home

(Berlin) According to well-informed sources here, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia will visit Berlin in early June. This has been conveyed to German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marko Marković. Political figures believe that this visit demonstrates the complete success of the German-Yugoslav talks and will produce two results: (1) Yugoslavia's relationship with the Axis powers will become closer; (2) Yugoslavia and Hungary may conclude a treaty of amity. As for the rumors in the Italian newspapers that Yugoslavia will join the Anti-Comintern Pact, authoritative sources here have not confirmed this, but they believe that under the policy of promoting such a trend, reaching this step in the future is likely. (Haitong, 28th)

(Berlin) Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marko Marković, after holding talks with German authorities here, boarded a train tonight to return to the capital of his country. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and many other important German figures were at the station to see him off. Foreign Minister Marković, before his departure, told reporters that he was very pleased that this trip allowed him to reaffirm the friendship between Germany and Yugoslavia. (Havas, 27th)

### British Parliament Passes Conscription Bill

Second Reading on the 4th of Next Month; Labour Amendment Rejected

(London) The conscription bill proposed by the government was passed today in the House of Commons by a vote of 376 to 145. The amendment proposed by the Labour Party was rejected by a vote of 380 to 143. (Reuters, 27th)

(London) After Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain presented the military training bill to the House of Commons, First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Stanhope presented the bill to the House of Lords. Opposition Labour Party member Lord Snell and Liberal Party member Lord Samuel both expressed their opposition, saying it was "unnecessary." After a short discussion, the House of Lords also passed it by a show of hands. (Havas, 27th)

(London) Leader of the House of Lords, First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Stanhope, presented the conscription bill in the House of Lords today, and it was unanimously passed by the entire House. The enthusiastic applause Stanhope received was rare in the House of Lords. Stanhope solemnly stated Britain's new obligations to Poland, Romania, and Greece, and emphasized the fact that France and the Soviet Union have already implemented conscription. (Reuters, 27th)

"...public property will be requisitioned in succession." He hoped that the Labour Party would not make any hasty decisions regarding the government's proposed military training bill, so as not to create a stalemate, causing those in other countries who support our country's policies to doubt our determination to implement this policy. "In my personal opinion, the position taken by the government now, that is, the position of resisting aggressive forces, has been unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, which is unprecedented. The people of the whole country are prepared to take all necessary measures to ensure the success of the current policy. This is what I firmly believe," he said.

### British and Romanian Economic Negotiations

Sir Frederick Leith-Ross also plans to go to Greece

Romanian Foreign Minister Meets French Premier

(Bucharest) Economic negotiations between Britain and Romania have begun in a harmonious atmosphere. It is reported that the British side has three intentions: (1) To assist Romanian industry, so that Romania, a country based on agriculture, does not become a "colony" of industrial countries such as Germany; (2) To ensure that the interests Britain holds in Romania are protected, and not to allow the Romanian-German agreements on mineral resources, forests, and oil to hinder Romania's independence; (3) To assist Romania in building seaports, so that in addition to railways and the Danube River, it can also have the convenience of navigation. (Havas, 27th)

(London) The Times recently reported that the government's chief economic advisor, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, is currently conducting economic negotiations in Romania. Once completed, he will proceed to Greece to make contact. It is reported that Greece has repeatedly requested Britain to increase the quantity of tobacco imports. (Havas, 28th)

(Paris) Romanian Foreign Minister Grigore Gafencu, when holding talks with Prime Minister Édouard Daladier this afternoon, personally presented a private letter from King Carol II of Romania, the content of which roughly stated that the increasingly close relations between France and Romania were very gratifying. Foreign Minister Gafencu was then accompanied by Romanian Ambassador César Téléscu to visit President Albert Lebrun, and continued talks with Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet in the evening. According to responsible sources, Foreign Minister Gafencu informed French cabinet members of his talks with the authorities of Poland, Germany, Britain, and Italy, and confirmed to them that Germany had never made any special demands and that Romania still maintained its freedom of action. As for Romania's good relations with Yugoslavia, they remained as before and had not been affected in any way by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marko Marković's visit to Italy and Germany. French cabinet members reiterated to Foreign Minister Gafencu that if Romania were invaded, they would definitely send troops to assist, which was the same as Britain's assistance to the country. Britain and France had also decided to provide as much economic assistance as possible to the country, so that its agricultural products would not have to rely on Germany as the only outlet. (Havas, 27th)

(London) The military training bill proposed by the government has been passed on first reading in the House of Commons by an overwhelming majority of 378 votes to 145, and the second reading is scheduled to take place on the 4th of next month. Prime Minister Chamberlain made a speech beforehand, urging the House of Commons to vote on it tonight, stating that although he had offered a promise on the 29th of last month, declaring that he would never implement conscription in peacetime, the current situation is completely different from the situation at that time. Since our country has accepted obligations to Poland, Greece, and Romania, its responsibilities have also greatly increased. There are already doubts abroad about whether our country has the determination to fulfill its obligations, so implementing national military training is imperative and brooks no delay. "Because our country's efforts to organize an anti-aggression front are obviously hindered by such doubts, we must correct them." Then the Prime Minister touched on the measures planned to restrict the profits of the arms industry, stating, "We cannot, on the one hand, demand that the people participate in compulsory military service, and on the other hand, allow others to take the opportunity to make profits. Reasonable profits for the arms industry, although we are unwilling to deprive them, but if we allow them to make unlimited profits, it is also not tolerated by the general public. Although the taxes borne by the wealthy class are already considerable, if a war does occur in the future, they must be greatly increased. At that time, private wealth is often regarded as public property and requisitioned in succession." He hoped that the Labour Party would not make any hasty decisions regarding the military training bill proposed by the government, so as not to create a stalemate, causing those in other countries who support our country's policies to doubt our determination to implement this policy. "In my personal opinion, the position taken by the government now, that is, the position of resisting aggressive forces, has been unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, which is unprecedented. The people of the whole country are prepared to take all necessary measures to ensure the success of the current policy. This is what I firmly believe," he said.

After the Prime Minister finished speaking, Opposition Labour Party leader Clement Attlee and Liberal Party leader Archibald Sinclair successively made speeches to oppose it, while Conservative Party right-wing leader Winston Churchill supported it. Finally, Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha concluded the debate. As a result of the House of Commons' discussion, it finally rejected the Labour Party's amendment and then, by an overwhelming majority of 378 votes to 145, passed the military training resolution. The following is a summary of the speeches made by Attlee, Sinclair, Churchill, and Hore-Belisha.

(1) Labour Party leader Clement Attlee said, "Our party is prepared to make sacrifices for the welfare of the country, which is no different from the government authorities, but we cannot agree with the implementation of conscription. At a time when the country urgently needs spiritual unity, this move will not only fail to strengthen the country's power, but will weaken it and divide it." Furthermore, if a war does occur in the future, Britain, in addition to making many efforts in the navy and air force, will hardly be able to imitate the scale of continental countries and form a strong army, and supply ammunition to various allied countries. This is obvious, and it can be seen that conscription is really unnecessary.

(2) Liberal Party leader Archibald Sinclair said, "When a war occurs in the future, the tasks that Britain undertakes should not be lower than those of other allied countries. The British army units sent to the continent should number more than 500,000, plus a reserve army of 500,000, then the British expeditionary force can reach as many as 1 million. All of this is what we recognize, but our party believes that the voluntary service system has not been fully utilized. Even with regard to the military training bill proposed by the government, its target is only young people aged 20 to 21, not the entire adult male population, and it is also felt that things have not been fully done."

Conservative Party right-wing leader Winston Churchill fully supported the military training bill, stating, "If those who oppose conscription prevail, then the entire organization of European countries resisting National Socialism will inevitably collapse as a result. But there is one thing that must be stated, I also believe that merely calling up young people aged 20 to 21 is really inadequate. The government seems to have to take other appropriate measures to ensure complete success. As for the obligations that Britain has accepted to other countries, they are the foundation of the security of various democratic countries."

(4) Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha declared at the conclusion of the debate, "Our country's entire regular army should have 224,000 men, but currently there are only 204,000 men. The reserve army should have 325,000 men, but currently there are only 167,000. As for the army auxiliary force, it was originally set at 96,000 men, but currently there are only 80,000 men. Among them, as far as the regular army is concerned, according to the current establishment, its personnel cannot be increased. As for reserve army officers and soldiers, they are all citizens with occupations, and it is also inconvenient to increase the training period. From this, it can be seen that implementing national military training is already imminent. The reason why the government takes young people aged 20 to 21 as the target is because most of these young people are in school, and it does not hinder them to temporarily suspend their studies. There are a total of 300,000 young people aged 20 to 21 in the country, among whom 30,000 have already joined the regular army or are serving in the auxiliary force. In this way, after the implementation of military training, another 270,000 can be called up." (Havas, 27th)

### Roosevelt's Mediation Process

(New York) New York Times correspondent stationed in Washington, Clarence K. Streit, recently published an article in the newspaper, describing President Roosevelt's mediation of the European situation, stating that President Roosevelt, when the European situation was repeatedly critical between May and September of last year, sent a representative to Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, and requested that the suggestions be conveyed to German leader Adolf Hitler, the content of which was to invite Mussolini and Hitler to each take warships to a neutral island in the North Atlantic, such as the Portuguese Azores, to meet with him, because "President Roosevelt wanted to directly ascertain what kind of minimum demands Germany and Italy were making for maintaining lasting peace, so as to know whether or not he could mediate." According to Washington sources, Prime Minister Mussolini conveyed this suggestion to the German authorities, but it was politely declined, saying that even if Hitler believed that this meeting had the possibility of reaching an agreement, he would not be able to leave Europe at this time. Although the time of this process cannot be determined with certainty, "it was roughly before the Munich Conference in September of last year, that is, before President Roosevelt directly telegraphed an appeal to Hitler." Since this matter was unsuccessful and left no trace, it is of course denied by the parties involved, but "it is a clear proof that President Roosevelt never made any provocative moves in the European situation. On the contrary, he was prepared to sacrifice his political future to maintain European peace." (Havas, 27th)

### German Ships Pass Through Gibraltar

### Creating a New Situation in "Pan-American Diplomacy": The Military, Political, and Commercial Fronts - A Traveler in Huatun

The Psychological Strategy of Germany and Italy

Special Correspondence for this Newspaper from Paris

An ancient saying goes, "Those without immediate foresight will have immediate worries." The diplomatic arena is like gambling. A country with strong armor and weapons and economic knowledge and scientific expertise as its backing, if it is good at creating an atmosphere, can achieve extraordinary success without much effort. For example, German leader Adolf Hitler annexed Austria and swallowed Czechoslovakia without bloodshed (Note: "Xi" means small house, and "Hitler" in German means someone hidden in a small house). He secretly employed psychological strategies to avoid chopping and killing and hatred and conflict, and loudly touted a new method of destroying countries without losing strength, which is truly chilling. As for the mutual support of the dictatorial countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, it is even more like short selling in the speculative market. Germany and Italy have no real strength in Asia, and their involvement in the Far Eastern war has been like a horse and a cow unrelated to each other from beginning to end. However, the war-loving countries of the East often find it convenient to take advantage of the tense atmosphere of Germany's gradual progress, seize the opportunity to gain profit, and use the gambling skills to restrain the whole world. The strategy of psychological warfare, feigning an attack in the east while striking in the west, when used at the right time, can move the whole body by pulling a single hair. Recently, the expansion of German territory has come to an end, and Italy's coercion against France is also making a gradual shift. A contemporary satirical cartoonist, P. van der Hem, has created a new picture, published in a certain Western European newspaper, entitled "Throwing Everything on One Last Bet." In the picture, two important figures from France and Italy are sitting face to face, concentrating on playing cards, while British Prime Minister Chamberlain and German leader Hitler are standing opposite each other in shock, each minding their own business. Slightly further away in the background are the Russian Commissar, Joseph Stalin; the Outer King of China; Japan's Hiranuma; and America's Roosevelt, standing like wild geese and cranes, looking eager and nervous, wondering what the outcome of this "big bet" will be. The depiction is vivid and lifelike. America in this world is blocked by the ocean on both the east and west sides, and its neighbors to the north and south have little real strength. Its air, sea, and land defenses are not easily attacked by enemies. Logically speaking, it should not have anything to fear, regardless of who it is facing. Unexpectedly, after the meeting of the four great powers of Britain, Italy, France, and Germany on September 29 of last year to resolve the fate and future of the democratic country of Czechoslovakia, America's diplomacy suddenly changed from its former arrogant style of dominating the north and south continents to withdrawing and becoming friendly with the small countries of Central and South America. America's distant affairs have abandoned its old plan of focusing on the Pacific Ocean to single-handedly defend against Japan, and turned its attention to the Atlantic Ocean, which faces Europe remotely. Moreover, the Spanish Nationalist Army and Italy each have historical ties of race and language with the Latin countries of Central and South America. America's opposition to the increasingly strong atmosphere of the Germany-Italy faction is worried about the distance and unconsciously relaxes its hold on the Pacific Ocean. This change in national policy can be proven by the following facts. Its indirect influence on the Chinese situation is clear to those with insight at home, and does not need to be elaborated.

(1) Domestically: America's wealth and its geographical advantage of not being easily attacked by enemies are more favorable than those of European countries. Regardless of which faction is in the country, they all agree on expanding military defenses.

(2) Central and South America: Until a few months ago, scholars in the country who were deeply familiar with the diplomatic situation, as well as newspapers with very well-informed international news, paid little attention to the countries of Central and South America. Recently, since the Pan-American Conference was held in the capital of Peru, the American people's attitude has changed. They have even said that once something happens, America will take it as its responsibility to protect the countries of Central and South America, and there will no longer be any distinction between them.

(3) Overseas: The American people have always been on the sidelines when it comes to European affairs, and their opinions on diplomatic issues are often inconsistent. Now, the entire country, from top to bottom, has a clear understanding and claims that once something happens in Europe, America will definitely join Britain and France in the war.

(4) Military Front: Brazilian Foreign Minister Oswaldo Aranha has stayed in Washington, D.C., for several weeks. Although the purpose is to finalize commercial matters between the two countries, the actual purpose is to negotiate the military mutual assistance plan between the two major countries of North and South America. The American naval advisory group has also arrived in the Brazilian capital of Rio de Janeiro. In addition, because Brazil is slightly closer to Europe, it will make it especially convenient for Brazil to receive a steady supply of American-made products such as aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. It is also heard that the American government will appoint 29 officers from the air and land forces to go to Haiti, Nicaragua, and other countries in Central and South America to run military schools for them. Military students from Central and South America will be entitled to the special privilege of attending advanced American universities. The authorities also plan to select three of the newest and most advanced cruisers from various fleets to patrol the main seaports of South America and cruise the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, starting in April and aiming to pass through the Panama Canal on June 4. American President Roosevelt also changed the naval maneuvers that were held in the Pacific Ocean in previous years to be held in the Atlantic Ocean.

(5) Business Front: American Secretary of Commerce Harry Hopkins is now abandoning the capitalist imperialism of asset-rich countries towards the countries of Central and South America, and replacing it with a new policy of equal interaction. In the future, there will be mutual communication and a two-pronged approach. Not only will America seek to sell its goods to the other party, but it will also buy the other party's goods that are waiting to be sold. At the same time, the American Export-Import Bank will invest heavily to revitalize all the industries of Central and South America, and will commit to improving agriculture. (To be continued)

### Aurora Women's College Holds Completion Ceremony for New Building Today

According to the Continental Times, the Bishop of Shanghai, Haou Kesee, held a moving ceremony yesterday (the 27th) afternoon in the new building at 181 Rue Poussin, blessing the new building of Aurora University Women's College. The university will officially open tomorrow (the 29th) with another ceremony. The Jesuit fathers of Aurora University have been planning the construction of a new building since 1937 to benefit young women seeking advanced education. Because many Chinese still oppose co-education, it is considered urgently necessary to establish a separate women's university in Shanghai. The new women's university was originally scheduled to open last year, but the construction was completely halted due to the war in 1937, preventing its opening on schedule. The president of the women's college is concurrently the president of Aurora University on Rue Luber, and the curriculum is the same, including Chinese and English/French literature, history, geography, pedagogy, chemistry, etc., with the addition of a domestic science course.

### Japanese Consul Visits Chairman of the Municipal Council, Requests Suppression of Anti-Japanese Newspapers

The Council Does Not Wish to Restrict Freedom of the Press

But Will Seek Solutions If Offense is Caused

According to the North China Daily News, it was revealed yesterday (the 27th) that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, visited Fessenden, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, on Wednesday afternoon, demanding that immediate steps be taken to ban anti-Japanese propaganda and anti-Japanese newspapers in the International Settlement. Miura handed a note to Fessenden in person. According to a senior official of the Municipal Council, the note was "couched in very polite terms," stating that the outbreak of anti-Japanese sentiment in the International Settlement was mainly due to Chinese-owned newspapers, which the Japanese authorities were very uneasy about, and requesting that all anti-Japanese propaganda and anti-Japanese newspapers in the International Settlement be banned.

The Council Studies the Note

It was heard yesterday that the Council members are currently studying the note and considering the memorandum previously issued by the Shanghai Japanese Residents Association. However, no formal reply has been given to the Japanese authorities regarding the note. According to a Council official who spoke to reporters yesterday, Fessenden and the Council members have long considered the issue of anti-Japanese propaganda and the outbreak of anti-Japanese sentiments in the press. While they do not wish to restrict the freedom of the press, they are responsible for taking action against any newspaper whose outbreak of emotions or propaganda may cause discord or offense in Shanghai. Action against such drastic propaganda, whether anti-Japanese or not, will be considered in the near future.

The Purpose of the Puppet "Mayor's" Protest

Miura's note followed a protest lodged by the "Mayor of Shanghai," Fu Xiaoan, with the French Consul-General, Baudoz. Fu's protest demanded that immediate steps be taken to arrest the murderers of Wang Xianming, a former official of the "Shanghai Municipal Government," who was assassinated in the French Concession on April 17, and requested that effective and appropriate steps be taken to arrest and control political terrorists in the French Concession to prevent similar crimes from recurring in the future. He also requested that the French Concession police authorities cooperate with the police officers of the "Shanghai Municipal Government" in searching for political terrorists in the French Concession. It is heard that the French Concession authorities are still considering this protest and have not yet replied to Fu Xiaoan, and are also studying the notes Fu sent on February 17 and March 10.

The Police Department Has Issued a Warning

According to the Continental Times, it was learned from reliable sources yesterday (the 27th) that the publishers and editors of Chinese daily newspapers published in the International Settlement, except for those owned by the Japanese, have received warnings from the Political Section of the Police Department against publishing material "likely to disturb peace and order." It is also heard that the French Concession authorities have recently taken similar steps. The Japanese Consulate authorities made requests to Fessenden, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, and the foreign consulates here last week, regarding their nationals issuing Chinese daily newspapers. The Police Department issued the warnings apparently following this request.

British Consul Advises Newspaper Companies to Pay Attention

Philip, the British Consul-General here, recently summoned the British publishers and editors in charge of Chinese newspapers and suggested that they cooperate and not publish words that the Police Department considers destructive. It is heard that the American authorities have not taken similar steps. The Police Department's warning is of a general nature but clearly states that if the Police Department believes that a Chinese newspaper violates the general warning, it will take police action regardless of who owns it. As to what kind of action will be taken, it was not clearly stated.

Opinions Differ

According to a famous lawyer here, detaining newspapers issued by foreign businessmen or intimidating news vendors may cause legal disputes, as such actions would be an extension of police power beyond its scope of authority. It is heard that publishers are willing to do their best to cooperate with the Police Department, but some have expressed that they cannot agree to suppressing legitimate news. Pressure has also been applied for several weeks on the publishers and vendors of books that do not need to be registered with the authorities of the two concessions. The Police Department has detained books, often with the participation of Japanese agents. Among the books seized is a Chinese translation of "Japanese Spies" by Vaughn, published by the Hua Mei Publishing Company.

### Ningbo City Area Bombed, People Extremely Calm

Seventeen Bombs Dropped on Both Sides of Ling Bridge

More Than a Hundred Killed and Wounded, Huge Fires on Both Banks

Whether Ling Bridge Was Destroyed Awaits Further Reports

At around 9:00 AM yesterday, five Japanese planes suddenly flew in along the coast in Ningbo. The air defense department immediately sounded the alarm, and citizens rushed to take shelter. The Japanese planes flew over the vicinity of Ling Bridge, circled several times, and then dropped seventeen bombs on the Banbian Street and Gonghou Street areas before fleeing. The houses in those two areas immediately caught fire, and more than a hundred citizens were killed and wounded. Rescue teams immediately went into action and bravely carried out rescue operations. By evening, the fire gradually subsided, and the dead and wounded were collected and treated separately. The people are calm, and local order is also good.

The Bombing Situation is Quite Serious

According to shipping industry sources, on the morning of the 26th, three Japanese planes carried out an air raid, dropping five or six bombs on the China Merchants Wharf in Zhenhai Port, attempting to bomb the Old Taiping Bridge, but most of them fell into the river, so there was not much damage. Unexpectedly, the shipping department of the German company "Rhein und Seehandel" in this city received a telegram from its Ningbo branch yesterday afternoon, saying, "This morning, five Japanese planes attacked Ningbo and dropped seventeen bombs on both sides of Ling Bridge, injuring many people and setting houses on fire. At the time of sending the telegram, the fire was not extinguished. More details to follow. Sent at 11:00 AM." The company subsequently received a telegram from its Ningbo branch at around 5:00 PM, (omitted above) "Seven Japanese planes extensively bombed the Ling Bridge area in Ningbo at 8:30 this morning. The number of deaths and injuries is definitely more than one hundred. The fire had not stopped by 3:00 PM. The houses from Houtang Street in Jiangdong and from Tianhou Temple to the Xiaocai Market near Ling Bridge have all been damaged. Sent at 4:00 PM."

Ningbo People in Shanghai Are Extremely Concerned

After the above telegrams arrived in Shanghai, the general Ningbo people in Shanghai were very concerned when they heard the news, because it concerned their hometown, and they inquired with the fellow villagers association and other related parties. In particular, they were worried about whether Ling Bridge had been destroyed. According to a reporter from the Modern News Agency, Ling Bridge is the old Jiang Bridge. In 1935, Ningbo gentry in Shanghai, including Jin Tingsun, Zhang Jiguang, Sun Meitang, Yuan Ludeng, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Maotang, and Fang Jiaobo, initiated the project and raised 700,000 yuan to rebuild it. The entire bridge was constructed with reinforced concrete, and the project was extremely magnificent. It was completed in May 1936. The bridge was purely for the convenience of Ningbo city's vehicular traffic and to enhance the city's appearance, and it has no military significance whatsoever. The eastern end of Ling Bridge is Jiangdong Street, and the western end is Xianhe tou (i.e., Banbian Street). The area is lined with shops and the city is prosperous, so the deaths and injuries will definitely be numerous as a result of this Japanese bombing. However, Ningbo is purely an undefended city, and the indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes only serves to kill innocent people. According to the Datong News Agency, news relayed from Ningbo to Shanghai stated that Ling Bridge was not bombed, and the Japanese planes flew towards Zhenhai after dropping their bombs in Ningbo.

### Wenzhou Customs Officials Ordered to Evacuate

Planning to be Loaded onto the Minghe Wheel to Shanghai

Considering Security Issues

Customs officials at Ouhai Customs in Wenzhou, Eastern Zhejiang, have been ordered to evacuate and are in contact with the Portuguese merchant ship "Minghe," owned by the Vanguarda Maritima Nacional, which is docked in Wenzhou, with the intention of chartering the ship to transport the customs officials to Shanghai. The ship has also telegraphed Shanghai to ask the company for instructions. The Shanghai company is considering the safety of the "Minghe" sailing to Shanghai because the Japanese have been indiscriminately detaining Portuguese ships. Therefore, the date of departure of the "Minghe" to Shanghai depends on the decision of the Shanghai company after consideration.

### British Shipping Most Affected After Illegal Blockade by Japanese Warships

Shipping of All Countries Declining

Will Be Eliminated If Competition Not Maintained

Opening of the Yangtze River Still a Distant Prospect

Since Japanese warships blockaded all coastal ports in China, refused to open the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, hindered the passage of merchant ships of various countries, and arbitrarily inspected, detained, and deliberately made things difficult, attempting to monopolize the shipping industry in various places, while at the same time vigorously expanding shipping lines in China, the shipping industries of Britain, the United States, France, and Germany in China have all been affected and have declined abnormally, while Japan has suddenly seen improvement, with merchant ships entering and leaving ranking first. The details are as follows:

Shipping of Various Countries

The number of merchant ships entering and leaving China for various countries in the first quarter of this year: Japan 1,545 ships, 2,526,387 tons; Britain 826 ships, 2,344,767 tons; Norway 244 ships, 519,514 tons; Germany 80 ships, 400,916 tons; Netherlands 53 ships, 242,329 tons; France 31 ships, 197,629 tons; United States 26 ships, 150,325 tons; Italy 29 ships, 142,892 tons; Denmark 60 ships, 165,628 tons; Sweden 13 ships, 45,032 tons; Greece 7 ships, 23,039 tons; Panama 8 ships, 13,682 tons; Portugal 170 ships, 7,406 tons,

British Influence

The shipping industry of various countries in China has always been dominated by Britain. Last August, it was 1,128,037 tons, September 1,219,250 tons, October 922,154 tons, November 872,546 tons, December 814,079 tons, January this year 840,302 tons, February 713,408 tons, March 791,057 tons. This proves that British shipping in China has gradually declined and has retreated from its leading position to second place, while Japan has risen to first place. For example, in January this year, it was 759,889 tons (second place), in February it was 832,149 tons (first place), and in March it was 934,349 tons (first place).

Attempt to Monopolize

The shipping industry is closely related to trade. The prosperity or decline of the shipping industry is the prosperity or decline of trade. Now, in order to sell Japanese goods in the occupied areas and implement its economic aggression policy, Japan controls the trade in its occupied areas, excludes the import of goods from various countries, and at the same time, under the pretext of military relations, obstructs the navigation of various countries in China, and vigorously expands the Japanese shipping industry in China, such as forcibly confiscating Chinese ships, opening up new shipping lines in various places, and giving Japanese ships priority in carrying passengers and goods. As a result, the Japanese shipping industry in China has unexpectedly jumped to first place since February this year, and the tonnage of ships has been increasing month by month. It also uses its special influence to illegally prevent merchant ships from various countries from entering non-occupied areas. Therefore, if Britain and France do not strive to compete, the shipping industry in China will be monopolized and seized by Japan in the future.

### Guerrilla Sweep: Japanese Troops at Nanqiao

Over 40 Killed

Over 20 Drowned

The Japanese troops at Nanqiao, after being attacked by guerrillas on three fronts for several consecutive days, still attempted to resist stubbornly. The fighting was fierce. The guerrillas charged forward relentlessly, engaging in over a dozen hand-to-hand combat encounters. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. In the end, the Japanese troops were unable to hold out and collapsed, retreating in disarray. The guerrillas pursued and killed over 40 Japanese soldiers, and over 20 drowned while fleeing into the Pu River. Yesterday, the town was recaptured by the guerrillas, who also seized a large amount of Japanese supplies. After this severe blow from the guerrillas, the Japanese troops are on the verge of total collapse.

Japanese Troops in Hongkou Install Anti-Aircraft Guns

Rumors have been rampant in Hongkou recently. Some say that the Chinese Air Force will soon fly over Greater Shanghai to bomb the Japanese troops, while others say that numerous Chinese plainclothes soldiers have infiltrated and are active, numbering in the hundreds. The Japanese are extremely uneasy and yesterday added more anti-aircraft guns within the area to defend against Chinese aircraft bombing.

Giant Japanese Warship Enters the Huangpu River

At 6:30 PM the day before yesterday, amidst the dimming twilight, a giant Japanese cruiser entered the Huangpu River. The ship's hull was twice the size of the Izumo flagship. It had eight main gun emplacements fore and aft, sixteen anti-aircraft guns, and carried four aircraft. It docked at the China Merchants North Wharf. It is widely believed that the warship came to China to attack fortresses.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Elects Chinese Members to Film Censorship Board

HSBC's Chinese Manager

Mr. Gong Xingwu Has Been Appointed

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Film Censorship Board for this year has now appointed Mr. Gong Xingwu as a Chinese member. Mr. Gong has served in the banking industry for many years and is currently the Chinese Manager of HSBC. He is enthusiastic about public welfare and has always been extremely concerned about social undertakings. His appointment to the Film Censorship Board will surely bring many contributions.

### German and Austrian Youths in Shanghai Flock to Enlist in British Army

To Date, Not a Single One Has Enlisted

The Underlying Intention Can Be Guessed

According to the English-language "China Press," among the German and Austrian refugees forced to leave Europe and come to Shanghai, dozens of young men have requested permission from the British authorities to join the British armed forces. Some have gone to the headquarters of the British Army in Shanghai on Dibble Road (now Huashan Road) to apply. The British Army told them to see consular officials. Others went directly to the British Consulate-General on the Bund. However, to date, not a single one has been enlisted. This morning (the 28th), an elderly German immigrant went to the British Army barracks on Dibble Road, wanting to see the commander. However, there is currently no British Army commander in Shanghai. Colonel Simonds, who has been appointed as the commander of the British Army in Shanghai, has not yet arrived. Therefore, he saw a responsible adjutant and made a simple request, saying that his son is six feet two inches tall and he wanted him to join the British Army. The adjutant told him to apply at the consulate. Before leaving, the German elder was asked why he wanted his son to join the British Army. The elder laughed and replied, "Soon he can fight Hitler!"

### Japanese Puppets Attempt to Dominate the Spring Cocoon Market in the Interior

Harsh Regulations Limit Purchasing

Shanghai Factories Prepare to Negotiate

As the spring silk season approaches, the Japanese puppets, in an attempt to monopolize the silk market in the interior and prevent Chinese and foreign merchants from getting involved, have revised the "Regulations" set during last year's autumn cocoon season. All silk cocoons produced by civilians must first be traded through the cocoon collection "agencies" established by the "province" and "county," and direct buying and selling is prohibited. If factory owners want to purchase cocoons, they must first report the amount they want to buy and pay a deposit. They are not allowed to purchase directly from civilians. Currently, the Japanese puppets have established cocoon collection "agencies" in cocoon-producing areas in Zhejiang Province, such as Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou (Wuxing), and in Jiangsu Province, such as Kunshan, Wuxi, Suzhou (Wuxian), and Changshu, arbitrarily lowering market prices. However, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other places are the origins of sericulture. Civilians all have their own drying stoves and can reel silk at any time. They are unwilling to be exploited by the Japanese puppets. However, due to the lack of such facilities in Suzhou, Changshu, and other places, they cannot store cocoons for long, so they are making great sacrifices.

Purchasing Difficulties Cause Anxiety for Factories

Shanghai's Chinese-owned silk reeling factories and foreign trading firms stationed in Shanghai, with the spring cocoon season about to begin, have sent personnel to various producing areas to conduct detailed investigations and to inquire about the Japanese puppets' methods for collecting cocoons. They have already returned to Shanghai one after another to report. The factories are quite anxious about the Japanese puppets changing the cocoon collection methods and revising the "Regulations." They originally planned to set up buying stations in the countryside to purchase cocoons, but this has been delayed because of this. Various Chinese and foreign factories and trading firms are currently engaged in joint consultations in order to discuss appropriate measures and negotiate with the Japanese puppets.

Chinese Silk Active in Overseas Markets

In the European and American silk markets, since our country's war of resistance began, international people have sympathized with us. Overseas silk markets that had long been seized by Japan have been affected by boycotts from various countries. Chinese silk has been exceptionally active. From August of last year until now, the amount of silk declared by the Shanghai Jianghai Customs to be shipped to Europe and America each month has increased by more than 30% compared to the previous one or two years. However, this week, sales have decreased slightly due to abundant inventories abroad.

### Assault on Chief Inspector Case: Protest Will Soon Be Lodged

Liley Returned to Ship to Retrieve Pipe

Catastrophe Ensued on the Return Journey

Injuries to Western Officer and Mrs. Liley Are Improving

According to the "North China Daily News," regarding the incident on the evening of April 24th in which Chief Inspector Samson of the Shanghai Municipal Police was assaulted by a Japanese Naval Landing Force major in the waiting room of the Country Hospital, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council received a detailed report on Wednesday night, along with eyewitness statements. The incident was studied by the Municipal Council directors yesterday and it is expected that a protest will soon be lodged with the Japanese authorities. This matter occurred after Liley, the principal of the Lester Training School, died in a car accident on Broadway Road. After Mrs. Liley and Western officer Wimsett of the Police Department were taken to the Country Hospital. Yesterday (the 27th), it was reported that Wimsett had a comfortable night and his condition was satisfactory. Mrs. Liley's condition has also greatly improved, but both are still unable to be questioned. Furthermore, according to the "Shanghai Times," after further investigation into the car accident on Broadway Road on Sunday night, the following facts have been confirmed: Liley disembarked from the Conte Verde liner in the afternoon. After returning home, he discovered that he had forgotten his pipe in his cabin on the ship. That evening, accompanied by Mrs. Liley, he drove back to the ship, which was docked next to the Hongkou Wharf. On the return to the city, he struck an obstacle on Broadway Bridge but did not stop. As they continued to drive, both Liley and his wife thought it would be best to drive back to the bridge to clear up any misunderstanding and avoid giving the impression that they had intentionally failed to stop when they should have. When they made this decision, they had already driven past the Garden Bridge. Seeing the Western officer Wimsett on duty, they explained the matter to him. Wimsett also thought it best to drive back and got into the car to accompany them. When they arrived at Broadway Bridge, they talked to the sentries from the unit stationed there for quite a while. After some time, Liley thought it was unnecessary to stay any longer and drove off. However, one of the Japanese sentries, believing that the matter had not been satisfactorily resolved, also boarded the running board of the car and interfered with the driver. The driver then tried to force the sentry off the car, likely swerving the car. While the car was turning at a bus stop, the two vehicles collided violently.

### Famous Person Interview: Mr. Yu Qiaqing - The Spirit of Serving Society

— Zhou

His Life Devoted to Faithfulness, Trustworthiness, Diligence, and Thrift

Decades of Struggle Admired by Chinese and Foreigners

Old News Rehashed Reveals Shanghai's History

Organizing the Industrial Promotion Exposition

Since China's opening of five ports for trade in the 22nd year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, our foreign trade has declined daily. The imported goods have increased daily, and the outflow of money is countless. I am very worried about this. I silently thought about the way to enrich the country. There is nothing better than developing commerce. We should open an industrial promotion exposition and promote it. Therefore, I widely publicized to the authorities and business people. At that time, Governor-General Duanfang of Liangjiang was one of the more enlightened Manchus. He strongly supported my statement, but fundraising was difficult. So, I first advanced 360,000 taels of silver, and the Ministry of Revenue allocated 700,000 taels of silver. The site was selected at Gulou in Nanjing. We began to construct the exposition site and the exhibition halls of various provinces, and built a light railway to connect the exposition site with Xiaguan for transportation. Duanfang was the chairman, and I was the vice-chairman. Just as we were actively proceeding, Duanfang was suddenly transferred to Beiyang. I was very worried. Given the situation in the officialdom at the time, it was truly "officials present, policies exist; officials gone, policies cease." If Duanfang left, the project would inevitably fail. So, I urgently consulted with Duanfang, telling him that the matter had been approved by the emperor, and there was no reason to stop it. The exposition lasted three months, and the products from all provinces were fully gathered. Two hundred thousand people attended the exposition. I initiated the industrial promotion exposition with the intention of using the exposition period to allow elites from various provinces and overseas Chinese from Nanyang to gather and exchange ideas and connect emotionally. Unexpectedly, Zhang Renjun succeeded Duanfang. Although he did not dare to openly oppose it due to imperial approval, he opposed me in every way. Later, the industrial promotion exposition was completed with a thousand difficulties.

The May 30th Massacre

At about 2 PM on May 30, 1925, an incident occurred in front of the Lao Zha Gate police station on Nanjing Road in the Shanghai International Settlement. Police officers shot students and workers, firing 44 shots. The order to fire was given by police chief Everson. Many were killed and wounded. This was followed by strikes and school boycotts, with huge losses. However, since the scope of the strikes was so large, the relief expenses were even greater. Although donations poured in from home and abroad, there was still a feeling of being overwhelmed. At that time, I was the chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and I was at the forefront. Looking around at the internal and external situation, I felt that there was almost no way to continue. I worked tirelessly to cope with the situation, and then the serious situation gradually eased.

Joining the Chinese Board of Directors

Regarding participation in municipal affairs of the International Settlement, I wrote a letter to the chairman of the Municipal Council in February 1906, proposing the establishment of a Chinese Representative Committee. I believed that Chinese people had no right to participate in the municipal affairs of the settlement, which was an unfair treatment. This contradicted the proposal of the consular body in 1866 and the opinions published by the chairman of the Municipal Council in December of that year. Subsequently, the Municipal Council increased the municipal general tax from 1.2 to 1.4. Residents in the settlement rose up to organize the Joint Roads Association and established the Chinese Ratepayers Association to stand on equal footing with the Foreign Ratepayers Association in order to participate in municipal affairs. As a result of the negotiations, five advisory members were added. After the May 30th Massacre, the five advisors resigned. At that time, most foreigners gradually realized that municipal administration of the settlement could not be done without Chinese-foreign cooperation. Therefore, in 1926, the Municipal Council requested the relevant diplomatic authorities and the Chinese government to negotiate and approve the addition of three Chinese directors to the Municipal Council. Their powers were the same as those of the foreign directors. In 1927, the two settlements proposed to increase the municipal general tax by two percent. Protests erupted, and the French Concession peacefully resolved the matter first. However, the municipal authorities in the International Settlement did not fully understand the intentions of the Chinese people. For those who did not pay the increased tax, they prevented them from doing business, and as a result, 41 businesses closed. Since the Northern Expedition was in progress and the country was not yet unified, I came forward to mediate for the sake of maintaining the overall situation and the security of the settlement. I stipulated that the increased general tax be called "extra," paid under protest. At the same time, the addition of five Chinese directors and six committee members was a transition, and it was verbally agreed that the number of Chinese directors would be increased in the coming year. However, the Municipal Council was under pressure and could not immediately make recommendations to the relevant authorities. After two years of effort, on May 2, 1930, it finally achieved satisfactory results.

The reporter recalled that, in order to commemorate Mr. Yu's contributions to the public welfare of the settlement, various Chinese and foreign circles in the International Settlement changed the name of Tibet Road, which runs north-south through the settlement, to Yu Qiaqing Road. This act is a lasting tribute to Mr. Yu. Mr. Yu was modest and said that the purpose of life is to serve, what is there to say? Later, I found a photograph taken at the Yu Qiaqing Road Naming Ceremony on October 1, 1936, which has not been seen by outsiders, and it is published to show Mr. Yu's great virtue, which is in the hearts of the people.

As we chatted, many people came to visit Mr. Yu to discuss relief matters. The reporter thanked him and left. (End)

### Puppet "Municipal Government" Forcibly Sells Fake Flags

Chinese-run shops in the Hongkou area of the International Settlement have recently been subjected to various harassments by the puppet municipal government. The merchants in that area feel pained because they are in the same settlement area, pay the same taxes, and yet suffer such ill-treatment. Last time, the puppet municipal government sent people to Hongkou to forcibly sell fake revenue stamps, which the Chinese shops unanimously refused. On the afternoon of the 27th, the puppet municipal government suddenly sent three thugs, one of whom was wearing a suit, was short in stature, and did not speak Chinese well. The other two, with threatening voices, forced the Hongkou shops to buy fake five-color flags and threatened to arrest those who did not buy them. It is heard that this matter is an attempt by the puppet regime to curry favor, but the shops are firmly refusing to buy them. The three quietly left.

### Shanghai Municipal Council: All Tax Sources Show Improvement

The Municipal Council's Regular Income for the Past Year

License Fees and Property Taxes Have Increased

The Shanghai Municipal Council's regular income for the past year has been excellent. The total amount actually received was 24,691,687 yuan, which is 2,525,007 yuan more than the budgeted figure, exceeding all previous records. The reasons for this include the sharp increase in population, which led to an increase in property taxes, and the rapid recovery of various industries and businesses within the International Settlement. All tax sources have improved. Last year, the bureau's land tax revenue was 8,0124,07 yuan, property tax revenue was 10,061,119 yuan within the settlement, 894,862 yuan in areas outside the settlement, license fee revenue was 3,003,761 yuan, bureau property rental revenue was 649,469 yuan, public and municipal business revenue was 1,848,779 yuan, and miscellaneous revenue was 57,835 yuan, all of which increased compared to the previous year (1937). Among these, the increase in license fees and property taxes was the most significant. The only items that decreased last year were the special advertising tax of 20,714 yuan and the wharf tax of 142,741 yuan.

### After Chen Caifu's Defection, Japanese Monitor Lu Ying

Japanese Suspect Lu of Colluding with Chen

Hu Zhenggu Shaves His Head to Become a Monk

According to the Nationalities Society, after the false surrender and defection of Chen Caifu's troops in Haimen, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses, so they are thoroughly investigating this matter. It was then learned that when Chen's troops falsely surrendered, Lu Ying, the head of the puppet police station, acted as a go-between. They suspected Lu of colluding, so from the previous day, the Japanese Military Police sent several plainclothes special agents to follow and monitor him, so his movements have been restricted. Lu's followers are currently running around to plead his case. It is also learned that Hu Zhenggu, the protagonist of the Pudong Terror Case, which was created by Lu Ying, has been unheard of since he was detained by the Japanese Military Police. It is now learned that Hu has been exiled to Peiping and has shaved his head to become a monk in a temple.

### Death of Professor Barhydt of St. John's University

Dr. Barhydt, former professor at St. John's University in Shanghai, passed away on the 12th of this month from heart disease in Seattle, USA. Friends and students in China were saddened by the news. Professor Barhydt was deeply knowledgeable and had been a professor of political science and history at St. John's University for many years. He never tired of teaching, and many students were influenced by him. He later returned to the United States and became a professor at the University of Washington. In addition to teaching, he was diligent in writing. His book "A Diplomatic History of China" won an award from an American academic society, which shows how much he was valued. He usually wrote articles for magazines and gave radio speeches, often expressing his deep sympathy for China. His passing is not only the loss of a giant star in the academic world, but also the loss of a good friend in China. What a pity.

### Beiyang Baoshang Bank Forced to Close: Statement from the Issuance Reserve Committee

The Bank's Reserve Fund Only Reached 10 Percent

The Ministry of Finance Urged Payment But it Was Never Made

After the Beiyang Baoshang Bank was forcibly closed and liquidated by the Japanese, the Issuance Reserve Management Committee issued a statement stating that the amount of reserve fund submitted to the Reserve Committee by the bank was only 10% of the bank's issuance amount. The Ministry urged payment but it was never made. Details are as follows:

Issuance Reserve Committee Issues Statement

The Beiyang Baoshang Bank was established in 1908 with the advocacy of the Governor-General of Beiyang and was not established until 1910. The initial authorized capital was 4 million taels, which was later changed to a limited company. The paid-in capital was 1,129,500 yuan. The general manager was Wang Kemin. The head office was located in Peiping, and there was a branch in Tianjin. The banknotes issued by the bank that were circulating in the market amounted to 3 million yuan as of the end of last year. It has now been forcibly closed by the Japanese and is being liquidated. It is falsely claimed that the reserve fund has been paid to the Ministry of Finance, which is ignored.

Issuance Reserve Committee Issues Statement

The Issuance Reserve Management Committee issued a statement saying that it has been reported that the Beiyang Baoshang Bank in Tianjin has been forcibly closed and liquidated by the Japanese, and it is claimed that the banknotes issued by the bank and its reserve fund have been received by the Ministry of Finance. After investigation, the issuance reserve of the bank was received by this committee according to the letter of the Ministry of Finance. So far, the amount of reserve fund submitted by the bank is only 10% of the total issuance amount. Repeatedly urged, the payment was never made. The bank's publicity is obviously instructed by the Japanese and intends to confuse the public. In addition to reporting to the Ministry for verification, this is hereby announced to the public.

### The Perils of Gambling Run Deep: Servant Gambles Away and Turns Thief

Stealing over two thousand yuan worth of belongings from his master

Two accomplices apprehended and brought to court for prosecution

Xu Yinbao (also known as Deming), a Western employee at the residence of Mr. Mai Tuo, a Westerner residing at 383 Daxilu, Shanghai West, is a young, frivolous individual. In his spare time, he would frequently visit various gambling dens in the Caojiadu area, indulging in dice games. However, he consistently lost, and each time he did, he would return to steal his master's belongings. This behavior was not a one-time occurrence. Around the beginning of the previous month, Xu, realizing the extent of his thefts and fearing discovery

and inescapable punishment, deserted his post and fled. After Xu's departure, the Westerner conducted an inspection and estimated that the stolen ornaments and money amounted to a substantial two thousand three hundred yuan, including a defensive handgun that was also taken. Xu's father, also employed as a Western servant in the same residence, subsequently received Chinese and Western letters from Xu, confessing the reason for his theft and escape.

Mai Tuo, acting on this information, reported the matter to the Jing'an Temple police station, which then requested the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant for Xu Yinbao. A few days ago, Xu's father learned of his son's whereabouts and immediately informed the police, who dispatched detectives to the vicinity of Fuxu Road and Tongfu Road, where they apprehended Yinbao. According to his testimony, Gu Shicheng, a local resident living at 55, Lane 245, Pushi Road in the French Concession,

was an accomplice in the crime and shared the stolen goods. Furthermore, Gu was responsible for disposing of the handgun. Consequently, the Chinese and Western detectives handling the case proceeded to Gu's residence to arrest him. However, Gu attempted to escape by climbing onto the roof, fearing punishment. He was eventually captured. Yesterday morning, both were escorted to the First Special Court, where Judge Zhong Qing conducted the preliminary hearing. Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, presented the previous case, stating that further investigation was needed

to recover the stolen goods and requested an extension for the interrogation. Xu confessed that due to gambling losses, he conspired with Gu to commit the theft, and Gu helped dispose of the stolen items. He also admitted that Gu wrote the letters to his master and father. However, Gu vehemently denied all accusations. Subsequently, the court ordered Xu and Gu to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.

### A Brawl Erupts in a Steamed Bun Shop

Participants wielded sharp blades and iron rods, resulting in six injuries

Zhao Rusheng, a thirty-year-old man from Qingjiang, runs a steamed bun shop at 11 Yinghua Lane, Roberts Road. Yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, Xu Guangting (30 years old) from Shandong came to buy two steamed buns. For reasons unknown, a verbal dispute erupted. After some time people came in to resolve the matter, only for it to die down. Shortly after, Xu gathered twenty to thirty people, including Xu Jinsheng, to seek revenge. Brandishing sharp blades and iron rods, they surrounded Zhao and his employee, Gao Bingsheng (39 years old, from Qingjiang), and began to brutally beat them. Zhao's wife seized the opportunity to escape and called for help in the nearby area. Soon after, several people armed with wooden sticks and kitchen knives rushed to join the fray. The resulting brawl caused injuries on both sides. Zhao Rusheng, the owner, sustained four knife wounds to the head, one to the left hand, and one to the right arm, leaving him in critical condition. Gao Bingsheng suffered injuries to his left arm and back. On the opposing side, Xu Jinquan (25 years old, from Yangzhou) received a knife wound to the head, Liu Yonghai (28 years old, from Shandong) suffered injuries to his head and hands, Sun Fusheng (28 years old, from Qingjiang) sustained a knife wound to his left hand, and Xu Guangting (30 years old, from Shandong) suffered a knife wound to the back of his head. In total, there were six injured individuals. Subsequently, the local police from districts 140, 3354, and 329, along with Indian constables, arrived at the scene. The remaining perpetrators scattered in all directions. The six injured were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment.

### Robbery and Murder at Xizilaihuo Street Last Night

Three Robbers Force Open the Back Door of Fuchang Pawnshop

Killing the Accountant and Stealing Valuables

Fuchang Pawnshop at 122 Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession, owned by Ye Xiangxing from Dongting East Mountain, Suzhou, has been in business for many years. The pawnshop had an accountant named Tang Shenglin, 28 years old, who was from the same hometown as the owner. At 10:45 last night, three thugs, two dressed in long robes and one in short attire, arrived at the pawnshop. They claimed to be redeeming important items and repeatedly knocked on the back door. Jiang Haoqing, a teenage apprentice from Changzhou, opened the door. The three men rushed in. Tang Shenglin was at the counter, settling the accounts. Without any explanation, one of the men dragged Jiang the apprentice upstairs and gagged him with cloth. The other two dragged Tang Shenglin to a small room behind the reception hall and repeatedly stabbed him with knives. Tang was unable to resist and suffered more than ten stab wounds to the head, dying instantly. The thugs stole over one hundred yuan in paper money and silver dollars from the counter

and a gold ring. They escaped through the back door and disappeared without a trace. It was not until the other employees returned to the shop that they discovered the horrific crime. They immediately reported the incident to the police. The police chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate the scene. After questioning the apprentice and other employees, they learned that one of the three men had come to the shop yesterday (the day before) afternoon, claiming that he had an electric fan that had reached its expiration date and that he wanted to add two yuan in interest to extend the redemption period. He said that he would return the next day (yesterday) to redeem it. The apprentice recognized him as the man who had come to add interest and opened the door without suspicion, never expecting that they would come to commit murder and robbery. After questioning, the detectives transported the body to the mortuary for examination and reported the case to the Second Special District Court. They also took the apprentice to the police station for further investigation.

### Intellectual Youths Impersonate [Organizations] in Shanghai to Commit Fraud; Special Hearing Postponed

Numerous crimes warrant further investigation

Qi Rengzhang, president of the China News Agency, along with Chen Xueming, Zhu Shaoliang, Liu Liansheng, Zhang Xingzhi, Peng Jiangtian, and others, after the westward movement of the National Revolutionary Army, seized the opportunity to impersonate the Shanghai Third Brigade, Eighth Detachment of the Three People's Principles Youth League. They printed various materials and defrauded people from all walks of life,

deceiving countless victims. Recently, they approached Yang Xueqiao, the owner of Yang Dingyuan Cotton Mill at 20 Jinlong Street, accusing him of serving as the "Chairman of the Maintenance Society" in Qibao Town, attempting to extort four thousand yuan. Yang reported the matter to the Central Police Station, and Chinese detectives Wang Chengying, Jiang Shangpei, and Yang Peisheng apprehended Qi and the other six suspects. They were sent to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. The details were previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the criminal

court to continue the hearing. Yang Xueqiao also hired lawyer Li Weibin to file a lawsuit, refuting the accusations that his client was the "Chairman of the Maintenance Society" in Qibao Town. He stated that Yang had fled to Jiaoli shortly after the war and then came to Shanghai. He never participated in any puppet organizations or engaged in traitorous activities. Furthermore, Yang was a legitimate businessman who served as the chairman of the Qibao Town Chamber of Commerce and would never

degrade himself by colluding with the enemy to shame the nation and its people. He requested that this be clarified. Subsequently, police lawyer Ru Baoheng stated that due to the numerous crimes committed by the defendants, it was difficult to investigate everything at once. Therefore, he requested permission to postpone the hearing again to allow for a thorough investigation before merging all the charges. The court then summoned Sha Jintang, who carved the seals for the defendants, and Chen Jianming, who printed the letters, to testify. The two men testified that

Peng Jiangtian and Zhu Shaoliang commissioned them to carve the seals and print the letters. At the time, they did not suspect any deceit and therefore agreed to provide their services. The defendants' lawyers, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, requested the court's permission for the defendants to be released on bail. Judge Feng stated that due to the seriousness of the case, he could not grant the request at this time and ordered a postponement for a special hearing.

### The Skill and Awkwardness of Diplomatic Tactics

— Mao Lie

In this recent stage, the skill and awkwardness of international diplomatic tactics can be clearly compared.

Let's start with Roosevelt's inquiry to Hitler and Mussolini. This inquiry can certainly be included in the scope of diplomacy. However, it did not go through the usual diplomatic channels, with officials in charge of diplomacy taking responsibility, but instead, the head of one country directly inquired with the head of another country. This is a new record in diplomacy, and the attitude is bright, the meaning is serious, and it is incomparable to general diplomatic rhetoric, so its value exceeds the general diplomatic methods, and we cannot criticize it for skill or awkwardness.

However, the international diplomatic repercussions that followed this thunderous sound can be judged at will.

Mussolini's reaction was awkward. He gave a speech that was empty and irrelevant to Roosevelt, and everyone could see that he was at a loss for words. Some say that because he knew he was not an important figure, he simply went through the motions, and the grand finale would be sung by Hitler, which may be correct.

Hitler's reaction was skillful. He did not respond directly, nor did he rush to give a speech, but instead racked his brains and came up with the idea of turning to the smaller countries to ask whether they were being threatened by Germany. In this way, he could not only delay the reply, but also use the replies of the smaller countries, which he expected to be favorable to himself, to talk nonsense with Roosevelt and avoid being embarrassed. But this approach of his has been unanimously ridiculed by international opinion, and even if it is skillful, it is also nonsense.

The smaller countries' replies to Hitler, of course, cannot be judged for their skill or awkwardness, because as most people say, civilians under the guns of thugs, and schoolchildren under the coercion of naughty children, have no freedom to reply, so although their replies are extremely awkward, we can only leave them unsaid.

Romania's reply was the most skillful! She said that Romania's existence under threat from Germany was something Romania did not know, and that the question should be asked of Germany itself. "Using the spear of the son to pierce the shield of the son," "using the way of the other to treat the other," "please enter the urn," these idioms can all be transferred to the diplomatic authorities of Romania. However, some say that Romania's wonderful words are prompted by the confidence of having no fear: I am afraid that it is only a "scholar meets a soldier, and there is no way to reason."

The return of the British ambassador to Germany, Henderson, can be said to be the most awkward of diplomatic tactics. I have already said this, so I will not discuss it again. And the German government's treatment of Henderson can be said to be skillful in awkwardness. In order to preempt Henderson's actions, it simply refused to see him, which was awkward; but by making Henderson unable to use his skills and unable to see his own words, it gained the victory, which was skillful.

Diplomacy must be backed by force, but skillful diplomacy can often exceed force in its success, which is what is meant by "not leaving the feast, but defeating the enemy thousands of miles away." The current government authorities still seem to need to pay attention to diplomacy.

### The Drifter

— Le Huan

It was an evening filled with flying sand, when we arrived at our destination, Dangshan County in northwestern Jiangsu.

A long, iron mass, snaked forward, its thousands of human figures wriggling in the twilight, treading on soft, powdery soil; one shadow pressed against another, linking together to form an endless iron Great Wall, its tail hidden beyond sight.

To reduce the target, this iron torrent flowed into each village, scattering into various places that could echo each other.

I was a staff member of a certain unit. There were twenty-some of us, and we found a place to rest at Ji Zhuang, a village about two li from Dangshan City. Our preliminary work was launched in this ancient and sincere village.

The common people did not cast horrified glances at the gray shadows, but rather revealed excitement on each simple face; even the elderly would come with their crutches, extending warm greetings as if to their own sons. What they possessed was a joyful heart, which could be discerned from each clear and rapid breath.

News spread quite quickly in the village. Within less than half an hour of our arrival, the threshing ground was filled with dozens of innocent children, all of school age. Each child raised their head, eyes wide open, blinking rapidly; they made no sound, paying attention, listening to every unfamiliar movement and every unfamiliar word of our group, concentrating as if listening to a teacher telling a fairy tale in the classroom. Here, we examined each of their lovely faces, how deeply they were imprinted in our minds.

We began to chat haphazardly in the national language. They seemed a little strange about our changing to another language, but they understood our words without difficulty, and quickly shifted their bodies into casual poses. In the dim starlight, their faces were vaguely visible, blushing, and their eyes sparkled with a crystalline light, appearing even more excited; they vied to answer the questions we asked.

There was no strangeness, no timidity. We were as close as brothers reunited after a long separation.

They told us that they were still studying at a village elementary school less than two li away, and they were not shaken in their determination by the threat of gunfire. They told us their names, and the older children even spoke of the simple meaning of resolute resistance, which they had gleaned from their teacher’s memory.

So we suggested a few songs that everyone generally knew and asked them to sing along with us; they understood simple rounds and also knew how to watch the movements of my hand to determine the pitch and tempo of the sound.

Sharp singing reverberated throughout this quiet village.

Children, adults, men, and women flowed into a vast sea of people. The adults wanted to call the children in for dinner, but they were drawn in by the singing, unable to speak their words, and the children forgot their hunger. The magnificent singing spread through the fields, penetrating deep into everyone's heart. (Fundraising Through Sales)

### Rebirth at the End of the Century

— Shi Feng

One,

The doomsday

Cometh;

The decayed

Corpse of the old world

Is waving to you!

Two,

In Asia,

A hesitant giant

Has stood up!

Towering on the top of high mountains,

Like an ancient sage,

Awe-inspiringly

Standing tall!

Three,

The wind is swirling!

The rain is bursting!

Nurtured in the interplay of light and heat,

The century bestows new life again.

### The Three Stages of

### The First Deployment

— Ren Linrui

Early autumn, the weather was still very hot, and the cotton cultivated and grown by the earth, the plump white flowers, had long been picked by the local farmers, as a reward for their hard work during the year that they valued, leaving only withered branches, scattered all over this desolate field.

There were no mountains, but there were earthen burial mounds, protruding from the fields, as if managing everything for the vast field.

There were several small rivers that were not wide, but they could lead you to the famous Tang Family Ancestral Hall here, and they could also ferry you to the shore, into the vast, dark, deep green bamboo forest. Now, during the day, you could often see garrisoned soldiers here, waving to you, sailing in sharp-headed boats, rowing single sculls very easily.

The Second Public Hospital for Wounded Soldiers was set up in a public elementary school in the countryside, with rescue teams sent from the Shanghai Red Cross providing service inside. The hospital was extremely quiet, and the bedding used by the wounded soldiers was mostly brought in person by the common people.

We often went to this hospital because the Boy Scouts also had to do rescue work. The road was very difficult to walk when carrying wounded soldiers, and we had to walk along the narrow paths between the fields, but we were not used to walking there, so we eventually walked along the banks of the small river. The small river was beautiful, and the small river was our compass.

There were only twenty or so village houses near the public hospital in the fields, all old and dilapidated, which were the only houses here, and several of our comrades lived there.

It was already getting cool at night, and the moon shone on the fields. Looking out, there were no lights, only the silvery gray of the moon, covering the fields.

Old Gu—he was older than me and taller than me—and I went on sentry duty together. He carried a rifle and several rows of bullets on his back.

Although I felt a bit cold, we were willing to accept this duty, and we patrolled the fields.

Two strong men in front of us answered us—the password for the night—and immediately hurried over to tell us that someone seemed to be sending signals behind the burial mound ahead, and the green flames were quickly released into the sky.

I took the gun bayonet from Old Gu's hand; the four of us quickly dispersed to surround this dangerous burial mound. I felt a bit hesitant, a bit scared. But catching people, ah! I stepped on the grass and quickly circled around.

"Nothing!" When we encountered each other after running around in a circle, we all uttered the same strange sound.

After dismissing the strong men, we hid nearby with vigilant hearts, aiming the muzzles of our guns at the burial mound just now.

The cool night was silent, and there were only our two breaths here.

### The Art of Pulling

— Geng Zhi

To give without receiving is not proper; therefore: to push without pulling is not beneficial. Moreover, pushing is always a passive action of preventing trouble before it happens and removing trouble after it has already happened, unlike pulling, where everything that is beneficial to oneself is pulled, which is a thorough and authentic active action. Therefore, the relationship between pulling and pushing is like that between a wolf and a werwolf, inseparable, and it also has independent value, and it is impossible not to learn it!

The first skill in pulling is naturally pulling people. For example, if you want to become an official, you must learn to win people over; the items in winning people over include: inviting them to eat, inviting them to stroll, inviting them to play; paying homage to teachers; establishing ties through marriage, establishing ties through godparentage; recognizing people from the same hometown, recognizing classmates, recognizing relationships through generations; giving gifts; paying respects at the yamen; big wives, small wives, sisters, or any women, going through internal channels; ... each item, when studied carefully, is enough to become a special book; nothing is difficult in the world, only fear of those who have a mind to do it, this is passed over without mention here.

If you want to get rich, you must learn to win over directors. Because the most convenient way to get rich, in addition to becoming an official, is to start a company, open a store, or organize a factory. These avenues, as long as you can win over first-class directors who are wealthy and reputable, second-class directors who are wealthy but not reputable, and third-class directors who are not wealthy but reputable, and they elect you as manager, open branches, stores, and factories, and make you general manager, you can make a great fortune. If the company develops and there are indeed profits, of course you can make a great fortune; if it does not develop, or even loses money, or even goes bankrupt, you can still make a great fortune, because stirring up troubled waters to catch fish has always been a secret method passed down, and the formula is that the shareholders are wiped out, while the managers or general managers are well-fed.

In addition to winning over directors, of course winning over shareholders is also important. But with the directors above being sufficient to rally people, the shareholders will respond to the news and it will not be a problem.

If you say that the directors are elected by the shareholders, how can you win them over, then I must say to you: Stupid child, you cannot be taught, you must study hard! Because elections are just formalities, pulling is the reality!

Recently, in addition to starting companies, some people have had a whimsical idea that opening schools is also a good way to make money, so you must also work hard to learn about pulling related to opening schools.

First, you must also know how to win over directors; the qualifications of the directors are exactly the same as those of all companies. Second, you must know how to win over teachers: teachers who can lecture and attract students must be won over; black teachers who are able to work hard, are inexpensive, help me get rich, are clean, and do not think of getting involved must especially be won over. Third, you must know how to win over students: the principle is that no one who comes is refused, and the more the better; the slogan is that our school has thirty-six subjects, all of which are complete, to meet the various needs of students; or we post advertisements in newspapers, or paste posters, or distribute leaflets, or even hire touts or use brokers as means.

It is said that the principal is a leader in the cultural world. In our country that values literature, the reputation is even better than that of a manager or general manager, and the wealth is at least about the same as that of a manager or general manager. It seems that on the point of gaining both fame and fortune, the principal's pulling is even more important to learn skillfully than the manager's or general manager's pulling.

The second skill in pulling is probably pulling credit. This pulling is exactly the opposite of pushing.

On a small scale: when playing soccer with others and winning, you roar to the crowd: Fortunately, that kick of mine determined the outcome; old brother, you defecated without toilet paper, if I didn't have waste paper on me to provide you with a convenience, you wouldn't be able to stand up; ... even the cook who boils water will come up with a "ugly self-praise." On a large scale: lower-level clerks and workers go out to shops and factories, working hard and sparing no effort. Once they get rich, when dividing the dividends, they are split into seventeen shares, and what they get is a few percent of one share, while the manager or general manager gets several shares alone; white-robed junior generals and fire-headed soldiers conquer cities and seize territory, and kill generals and capture flags, all of which are credited by Zhang Shigui to his dog-in-law He Zongxian; ... even the heads of a country, who routinely oppress the people and are capable of bullying the weak, then when giving speeches, call themselves the saviors of the people and the protectors of peace. In short, "all the bad things that go wrong, that suffer losses, and that are detrimental are pushed onto others," while all the smooth, beautiful things that increase fame, status, and income are pulled onto oneself.

"One pull after another seems to require "three pulls" to be a happy ending." However, there is actually too much to learn for three pulls, and it goes beyond the circle of a happy ending. Now I can only briefly mention a few types to make it a tail of a snake.

A person who pulls manuscripts to be an editor must learn this skill: when there is a shortage of manuscripts, there will be manuscripts, and when the manuscripts are of poor quality, there will be good manuscripts. Generally, when there is no money, there is only bowing and scraping, and clever means of seizing; when there is money, then what is drawn from here is poured over there, or what is thin there is thickened here. The former is a young junior, beautifully named a new writer; the latter is an old brand-name writer, beautifully named an advanced figure in the literary world.

A person who makes a living by pulling strings on the Shanghai Bund must learn this skill:—

A person who pulls customers, often prostitutes—

Enough, if I keep pulling, it will become unrecognizable. I'll stop here and not pull anymore.

### Sino-Japanese Diplomacy and Goryeo

(See this newspaper from April of the 11th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)

Japan wanted China to assist each other. Because China had signed a treaty with Goryeo, if they were attacked by another country, China would use troops to assist. Since there was a previous agreement, this one was difficult to establish. Upon hearing this news, Japan immediately sent an imperial envoy and the Goryeo consul stationed in Shanghai to Beijing to discuss establishing a new agreement. Japan's desire to establish this agreement was extremely clever, because they knew that they were on bad terms with Goryeo and were about to start a war. If they could get China's military assistance, they would definitely be able to win.

### Centenarian Woman

Your subject, Li Hongzhang, respectfully reports: "Regarding a centenarian woman who has lived to be nearly 100 years old, who has personally witnessed seven generations and five generations living under one roof, please issue an edict of commendation and request Your Majesty's sacred review: Your subject has received a report from the gentlemen of Baoding Prefecture, including Zhang Qirui, stating that Wang Du, the mother of Wang Zhengang, a Jinshi from Xincheng County, is currently 94 years old and has served Zhengang's great-grandfather and grandfather. She has five grandsons, eleven great-grandsons, and two great-great-grandsons, and she has personally witnessed seven generations and five generations living under one roof. A family tree has been prepared and presented, requesting commendation. Your subject has reviewed and verified that the centenarian woman, Wang Du, showed filial piety and the whole family danced happily. The offspring competed in excellence. She has also seen them enjoy a leisurely life, and her story has long been spread as a beautiful tale in the neighborhood. Only in a prosperous era can such a good omen be seen. In addition to sending the attached family tree to the Ministry, it is appropriate to respectfully submit this report to request the Empress Dowager and the Emperor's sacred review."

### Chess Match Over a Thousand Li

The art of chess was formerly named "hand talk" by the ancients, because a single move against each other can determine victory or defeat without words. Therefore, even Yi Qiu (Note: a person's name, see Mencius), who was known as a national master, had never been able to enjoy the pleasures of this game without observing his opponent's face. (Note: In the orange garden of Bayin, after the frost, the oranges are as big as jars. When opened, there are two old men playing chess inside. See Youguai Lu for the story.) It was not expected that there would be two cities in New Gold Mountain, one called Sydney and the other called Adelaide, which are very far apart. There are two chess players who live in each city and use the telegraph to transmit chess moves, making it as if they were in the same room.

To be published tomorrow: A record of the disturbances in Shanghai during the Xianfeng years.

### We Request Mr. Chu Minyi to Give a Speech

Since Chairman Jiang launched the Spiritual Mobilization, all parts of the country have responded, and various departments have actively launched work. In newspapers and magazines, everyone is discussing the implementation methods of spiritual mobilization, and everyone is talking about the importance of spiritual mobilization. Spiritual mobilization has already begun to be recognized as a universally important task.

We are students, an important part of the nation, so naturally we should also do it, and do it very actively.

It was Friday when our student union convened a delegate meeting to implement the Spiritual Mobilization. We invited our principal and director of discipline to guide us.

The meeting began. The chairman reported on the meaning of the meeting, explained the importance of the Spiritual Mobilization, and asked the students whether they wanted to organize a Spiritual Mobilization Committee.

"The Spiritual Mobilization was launched by our supreme leader, and all citizens must implement it, so we should implement it without doubt, and there is no need for a vote!" This was the words of our principal, resolute, heroic, and accurate.

Secondly, we mentioned wartime education, because this is very important. The Third National Education Conference rigorously discussed and planned: to learn wartime skills and understand wartime theories during the Anti-Japanese War.

"Yes, this is an important issue, and I feel that anti-war education is not only important during wartime, but also should be prepared for during peacetime; I think that regarding the current issues, Chinese can read stories of national heroes and the speeches of national leaders, and civics can talk more about current affairs." This was the director of discipline speaking. He completely agreed with our proposal, and the principal urged students to buy more reference books as supplementary materials.

"Regarding wartime education, I have some opinions, which is to hope that teachers of all levels and subjects can have regular gatherings, in which the student union can send students to participate, where they can regularly discuss how to make the textbooks they teach cooperate with the anti-war effort, and what kind of teaching methods are suitable for the anti-war effort? I think that this will definitely be more helpful and more certain for the implementation of anti-war education." This was the opinion of a high school student, and it was a very good opinion. The principal and director of discipline both agreed, and the students also approved.

Afterwards, in order to thoroughly implement the Spiritual Mobilization, and in order to truly love our school, we raised the issue of our chairman, Mr. Chu Minyi. Because Mr. Chu is a relative of Wang Jingwei, and was also Wang Jingwei's secretary in the past, after Wang Jingwei betrayed the country and the nation, Mr. Chu was greatly noticed, and the rumors about our school from the outside world also increased accordingly.

This issue immediately sparked a heated discussion. Some advocated asking him to make a statement in the newspaper, some advocated asking him to come to the school to give a speech, some advocated asking the directors, some... Our conclusion from the discussion was: first, ask the principal to write a letter to Mr. Chu, asking him to set a date, when we students would go to visit him once, for the sake of loving our school with 37 years of glorious history, loving our chairman, and also for our own sake. During this visit, we would ask Mr. Chu to make a statement in the newspaper to express his attitude, so that students would have a deeper understanding of him, and faith; Secondly, ask Mr. Chu to come to the school to give a speech, either about the National Spiritual Mobilization or about Wang Jingwei, we believe that Mr. Chu would not refuse.

The proposal was passed in this enthusiastic agreement from the teachers and approval from the students. At the same time, the delegate meeting also came to an end.

This was last week's matter. This week, our Spiritual Mobilization Committee will hold its inaugural meeting, and it is scheduled for May ×, when all of our students will take an oath, and on that day, the school has agreed to invite Mr. Chu to give a speech and lead the oath.

This is how the Spiritual Mobilization in our school is being done, but a large part of the reason why it can be done well is because of the help of the principal and the director of discipline.

We hope that students in other schools will also launch the Spiritual Mobilization, and we hope that the principals and directors of discipline in other schools can also actively help students as they do in our school!

### Impressions of "The Oklahoma Kid"

— Qi Hua

“The Oklahoma Kid”

Produced by Warner Bros.

Screened at Grand Cathay Cinema

The sensational "G-Men" created a new line for American films to compete in filming G-Men, and James Cagney's name was as great as that of Edward G. Robinson. But since "G-Men", there have been hardly any better films, which is more like saying that it is difficult to follow up under a great reputation than to say that speculation will eventually lead to failure. A few months ago, I heard that James Cagney had a new work in Shanghai that surpassed "G-Men", translated as "A Generation of Heroes", but until now, we cannot meet it. If I'm not mistaken, it must be because the heroism of killing and arson is too terrible. The current "The Oklahoma Kid" still maintains the past style and does not have any special achievements.

The story tells that in 1893, when the U.S. government opened up the state of Oklahoma, Dan Kincaid and his son Ned were also among the immigrants, but when they arrived at the land they claimed, it had already been occupied by the famous gambler McCord (Humphrey Bogart). Dan, in order to quell the matter, was unwilling to litigate and worked hard to manage the land, gradually making this desolate land prosper. The residents were grateful for Dan's virtue and intended to elect him as mayor. The gambler, fearing that Dan would seize power once he held power, which would be detrimental to him, framed Dan for murder, put him in prison, kidnapped the judge, and instigated his subordinates to sentence Dan to death. James Cagney plays Dan's son, who has been wandering outside all year round. In order to avenge his father, he eliminated the three evils alone.

This is naturally another film full of heroism. When he eliminated the three evils, he held double guns and succeeded immediately, but in the end, when he wrestled with McCord, he finally succeeded with the help of his brother Ned's shot. Here, the screenwriter has too neglected the importance of cooperation and the power of the masses. Since the masses put Dan to death under McCord's instigation, then in the face of justice, they will definitely be more powerful in eliminating the conspiracy of evil forces. Therefore, when James persuades Dan to break out of prison, he is determined that justice must be done.

Ned's girlfriend, Jane (Rosemary Lane), finally married James. I think the insertion of this romance is also very forced.

The cameraman of this film is James Wong Howe. It is good to use various angles to capture the hooves and wheels when the immigrant cars and horses set off, and the picture is also beautiful.

### Service Spirit?

— Written by Zheng Dingqi

### Beggars

— Buddha

Beggars are the most annoying things. Suppose you are walking on the sidewalk, no matter which road you walk on, there will be a ragged wretch following behind you, constantly shouting, "Open your golden hand, and you will live to ninety-nine," "The more you give, the more you will be blessed, and you will open several pawnshops next year," "Do good deeds, and you will raise a big fat son next year," "What goes out in the light comes back in the dark, and you will make millions," if you pay attention, you will always be able to hear several wretch gentlemen complimenting you with so many good words.

Suppose you are modern grandmothers, ladies, and young ladies, they will be even more eager to follow you. The faster you walk, the faster they will follow you, and they will also shout humorously: "Grandmother, lady. Please, young masters and old lords," grandmothers, ladies, and young ladies see the wretches following behind, and there is also a special and rarely smelled odor from the wind, which is disgusting, and they may even play pranks and bring a few strong and yesteryear old white worms over, which is really unbearable. It is better to give them a few coppers and let them go. Such beggars are indeed extremely hateful, but they are also the "threshold" for them to ask for money.

There are also a few old-timers of beggars. If they have been chasing for a while and you do not give them money, they will scold "Chilao," "You will be like me one day," they also have a malicious term for begging for food, called "driving pigs." Some people give them money and still count them as pigs, isn't it hateful? I once heard old-timer A ask old-timer B, how many pigs did you drive today? Old-timer B replied, today I met "Chilao" and didn't get much money. They really make a good profit from this business without any capital, so some people say that after being a beggar for three years, even the emperor doesn't want to be, and there is some truth to this.

But on the other hand, being a beggar is because they are poor, have no food to eat, and are unemployed, unable to find work, so they beg for food. After all, they do not rob or threaten people. It is good if passers-by are willing to give them money, and they can't do anything if passers-by don't give them money. Although they are not good for the country and society, they are not very bad either, so some people say: "A beggar who throws away his stick is a good person," but there are friends who sell their souls and traitors who sell out their nation. Although they do not beg for food, they still live in Western-style houses and drive cars, but their "lasting fame" cannot be erased forever. It can be said that all the waters of the West River cannot wash away their evil names, and all the bamboos of the South Mountain cannot record their crimes. Such people can be said to have no heart or liver.

### Rain After the Storm

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Nine: Enduring Sorrow and Swallowing Bitterness, Tears Sprinkle the Four Walls; Practicing Thrift and Labor, Diligently Tending Ten Acres

Later, she discussed a business plan with Jin Danyu. After consulting with several of her old Chinese friends, they found this enterprise very novel. Everyone was willing to invest. Apart from Mrs. Surya, who took half the shares herself, amounting to 1.5 million national currency, the others eagerly subscribed for shares, exceeding 3 million yuan. Mrs. Surya said, "We are still in the trial phase. If people are happy to use these cars, we can expand to the whole of China. The capital required will be many times more. Since everyone is willing to invest, let's assume the company's capital is 5 million yuan. We will collect six percent first and start the trial operation." In addition to this, Mrs. Surya collaborated with Chinese friends to open a pharmaceutical company. Mrs. Surya had traveled to the interior of China and saw that the people there paid too little attention to hygiene. The emerging China is indeed vast in territory and population. Although it pays great attention to public health, its strength is insufficient. Mrs. Surya's pharmaceutical company is not like those in China before the war, which "advertise genuine prescriptions and sell fake medicines," or spend "one point on medicine, one point on packaging, and seven points on advertising." She offers genuine goods at fair prices, hoping to benefit the general public. She has made arrangements with various hospitals. Sometimes she funds the pharmaceutical company to produce medicines, which she personally donates to small hospitals. There is another matter to report to the readers. Recently, China has stipulated that the profits of private businesses for citizens shall not exceed ten percent. If they exceed this limit, the excess profit will be at the disposal of the public. For example, many factories engaged in foreign trade earn profits that greatly exceed ten percent. All excess profits must be used to improve the treatment of workers. Therefore, the wages and benefits of Chinese workers have gradually increased recently. Mrs. Surya had said long ago that the money earned in China would remain in China. In fact, not only that, but the money she invests in Chinese businesses will also remain in China forever, for the development of China. Let's rein in our words, like a wild horse. These days, Jin Danyu is busy assisting Mrs. Surya in planning and carrying out various businesses. So, today's promise to Mr. Wu Junsu to come to Suzhou is precisely stealing leisure from a busy schedule. Jin Danyu is a cheerful person. With her in the house, it becomes much livelier. So, before she even entered the door, her laughter could be heard. Many of her sisters came out to greet her, crowding around Jin Danyu and bringing her inside. (98)

### The Central Photography Studio's First Public Performance: National Defense Drama "Battle"

Written by Zhang Min, directed by Zhao Dan, starring Bai Yang and Gu Er'yi

After the outbreak of the unprecedented War of Resistance in Chinese history, many people in Shanghai, which had always been the center of film and drama, immediately left the city and went to the interior. During these twenty-two months, these drama workers went deep into the war zones and villages, using the bridge of drama to connect the relatively slow-moving rural areas and ordinary people with the War of Resistance.

I remember Jin Shan once wrote a wartime drama communication, saying that there was a local gentry who owned many guns and armed peasants, but he had not expressed his support for the War of Resistance. So, when they performed a play (a play that aroused the spirit of national salvation), they invited this gentleman to watch. After watching the play, the gentleman stood up in great emotion and firmly stated that he would do his best to fight the invaders! This small example shows how great the mission of salvation dramas is.

In addition to Wang Xianzai, Gong Jianong, Sun Min, Tang Jie, and Xu Xinyuan, who have returned to Shanghai, the rest, such as Lan Ping, Li Lin, and Zuo Ming, are all in Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, engaged in drama work; Jin Shan and Wang Ying formed the Salvation Drama Troupe to promote abroad; Cai Chusheng, Fei Mu, and Ouyang Yuqian stayed in Hong Kong to continue making films.

Most of the major directors in Shanghai, such as Ying Yunwei, Shi Dongshan, and Hong Shen, are in Chongqing. Many famous actors in Shanghai have joined the Central Photography Studio. This Central Photography Studio, centered on Shanghai directors and actors, has produced many anti-Japanese newsreels and films with anti-Japanese themes in one year.

Recently, all the members of the Central Photography Studio have prepared a large-scale public performance. The lineup of performers is rarely seen in inland performances. Moreover, most of them are familiar faces from Shanghai.

The play for this performance is a five-act national defense drama called "Battle." The playwright is Zhang Min, who has directed "Romeo and Juliet" and "Thunderstorm" for amateur experimental theater groups. The director is Zhao Dan, a well-known young actor from Shanghai. The "stage manager" is Gu Er'yi, who became famous in the film industry for playing the county magistrate in "Night of Joy," and Zhu Jinming, who is best at "amateur" lighting.

As for the actors, there are many more familiar actors, such as Bai Yang, Shi Chao, Wei Heling, Gu Er'yi, Qian Qianli, and all the actors of the Central Photography Studio. The theater for the public performance is the Cathay Grand Theatre. Although we have not seen this performance, we can imagine the enthusiasm and success of the public performance.

### Actors' Activities

— Hai

Feng Zihe Intends to Become a Monk: The old actor Feng Zihe likes Buddhism in his later years. He enjoys teaching his students. Recently, he wrote a martial arts play for the Golden Grand Theater, based on the story of Hu Luo'er. The entire manuscript has been completed and is planned to be rehearsed when Mao Shilai comes south. Yesterday, a reporter visited him and had a long talk. He suddenly expressed that he would go to become a monk, saying that all preparations were in place. This is an excellent opportunity and will be implemented this year. However, he will stay in Shanghai for the time being. When the situation improves, he plans to escape to Putuo Mountain.

Zhang Eyun Guest Stars in Cantonese Opera: Since joining the Golden Grand Theater, Zhang Eyun's reputation has been soaring, dominating Shanghai. It is heard that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent figure in Shanghai, contacted the theater. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association will perform a charity Cantonese opera for six days, and invited Zhang Eyun to join as a guest star.

Liu Hanchen is Doing Well: The martial arts veteran actor Liu Hanchen has been invited by the Tianchan Stage to come south. Since taking the stage, his performances have been sold out, breaking Huang Guiqiu's record. The plays he performs are "Xiao He Chasing Han Xin under the Moon" and "Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles." His entire "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is different from others. He himself also stated that he has formed his own school. Liu has been away from Shanghai since leaving the Golden Grand Theater. He has returned to Shanghai after several years. His demeanor remains the same, and his artistry and spirit are even more abundant than before.

Dance World Sketches

### Whose Crime (Part 1)

In recent months, many cases about dance hostesses have been seen in newspapers, the most prominent being the suicide case of He Die and a certain dance patron, and the lawsuit case of Gu Yumei and a Mr. Lei. We cannot list them all or criticize them one by one. The book says: Everything has a beginning, but few have an end. These many unfortunate events, the parties (20) cannot be careful at the beginning, and it cannot be said that this is one of the reasons. In "Dream of the Red Chamber," there are two sentences—knowing today, why bother in the first place. I think these people at the last moment, may not have this feeling

Once, I came out of the Paramount Ballroom and met a dance hostess apprentice, her face pale, head down, as if she had some hidden worries. I asked her if she was here for an appointment? She said, who would come to a unlucky person. I wanted to find someone to talk to, would master be willing to accompany me? So we found a cafe to sit down, she said: He Die is dead, we can never see her again, I knew she said it with feeling, so I replied to him: Chen Xiaotian is dead, you can't see him anymore either. She said: No wonder people say you are thirteen o'clock, (dance hostess slang, probably means crazy.) Clearly a good person is sitting here, how can you say he is dead? I said: This is Chen Xiaotian at this moment, what about the Chen Xiaotian you saw last time? For example, if I change my name to Tian Xiaochen today, for example, if I never see you again after the last meeting, what's the difference between that and me really dying? Besides, it seems very ordinary for you and me to sip tea and talk here tonight, but I can say that it is absolutely impossible to reproduce it in the same way in the future. She said, I may be poor, but I can still afford this cup of coffee, don't talk so difficult. I said, it's not a matter of money, if our meeting here next time, the motive is already different from this time, not to mention the adults we talked about, the things we ate, the surrounding environment and the guests, can there be one thing that is the same as this time? Lao Tzu said it well, length and shortness complement each other, high and low lean against each other, which means that all external appearances are relative rather than absolute. Zhuangzi said: Call me a cow, and I will respond as a cow, call me a horse, and I will respond as a horse, which means that everything about me changes with each person's observation. So we don't need to be too serious about everything in life. If he is taller than me, I might as well say he is a tall person, and if he is short, I will say he is a short person. If he treats me well, he always thinks I am good. I might as well admit that I am good, and I might as well admit that he is a good person. If he treats me badly, he always thinks I am bad. I might as well admit that I am bad, and I might as well admit that he is a bad person. As for the person who used to treat me well, now suddenly treats me badly, that's just that his perception of me has changed from the past to the present, why not change a little bit too. In short, Zhang San and Li Si are just pronouns. If Zhang San used to treat you well, but now suddenly treats you badly, why must you cling to the good impression of Zhang San in the past, why not treat him as Li Si? After a while, I met a student again. She said that Master is really a good person. If I hadn't heard what you said that night, I would have almost committed suicide. I said, you think I'm a good person, then I'm a good person. She said, when will you talk to me again, I feel much more cheerful in spirit now. I said, there is a couplet in the Guandi Temple, the second line is "Everything follows fate, fate has its share, nothing is asked beyond it" Whether you and I have a chance to talk again depends on your and my fate.

### A Who's Who of Small Theaters (Part 2)

— Man Fu

The Era Department

The Era Theater, the venue is larger, the seats are more comfortable, and the actors it employs are also very complete. The front desk is managed by a Mr. Shen, while the backstage is contracted by Zhang Wenjuan's father, Lian Sheng. Xi Yongyi is hired to take charge. Among the three "small theaters," the Era Theater sells the best, but unfortunately, it is not managed properly. The best seats are controlled by the tea servants. Non-acquaintances cannot get the best seats. As a result, there are often disputes in the theater, and business is gradually declining. If it can be actively reformed, it can also save the situation.

Zhang Wenjuan is the leading male role of the Era Theater. She learned her art from two gentlemen, but what she learned was not the right path. Recently, she hired the old actor Chen Xiuhua as a teacher. A famous teacher will surely produce excellent students. Su Shaoqing also greatly appreciated her performances in "Li Ling Stele," "Black Basin," and "Pearl Curtain Village." She is only twenty-eight years old and can perform many plays. If we talk about the Kun (female) actors who play male roles in small theaters, Wenjuan should be the best, more promising than Le Di.

Jiang Muping is the daughter of Jiang Xintang. She can perform even more plays than Wenjuan, but unfortunately, she is broad but not precise. Her acting and expressions are not weak, and her appearance is also good. Her art is close to Ma Lianliang's style, which is not appreciated by knowledgeable people. Her plays are taught by her father. If she works hard, her future is unlimited.

Qiu Yunyan, a Kun actor who plays Qingyi and Huadan, is the daughter of the late famous martial arts actor Zhang Mingwu. Her appearance is similar to Jia Biyun in her prime, and her acting is also like her. Her art was personally taught by her uncle, Liu Zhenting, following the rules and completely in the old style. (Liu Zhenting was the early famous Zijin Xian of the chrysanthemum world. Most of the Kun actors in Shanghai came from his school.)

Su Qiu is the daughter-in-law of the late old actor Xiao Mengqi and the wife of Meng Xiaofan. From a famous family of actors, she is of course not bad. Su Qiu plays Qingyi with dignity and solemnity, and plays Huadan with elegance and unrestrainedness. Xiaofan has been dead for many years. Su Qiu is determined to remain a widow and makes a living by singing. There is no Kun actor in Shanghai who can match her. Qiu Fenglin, a Kun actor who plays male roles, is Xiao Junpei, who used to sing both male and female roles in the Youmei Class of the Xianshi Amusement Park more than ten years ago. His acting has become slippery. He is old and not valued, and now he has become a member of the troupe. However, three years ago, he sang in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area under the name of Lian Kuiliang and was very famous.

Zhou Xueqin, from the Women's Peking Opera Troupe, is the second-rate Dan actor of the Era Theater. Her voice is very good, but unfortunately, her appearance is not beautiful. Her father plays the qin in the Qiankun Theater of the Great World. An Shuying is a student of Zhu Dongmei's Fengyi Kun Class. Her martial arts are still impressive, but her appearance lacks heroism and her pronunciation is not good. It is a pity that she is short, which is her biggest disadvantage, but her play style is quite upright, which is rare in small theaters.

Shen Junqing, a male actor, plays Xiaosheng. His appearance is too vulgar, but he plays poor scholar roles such as Zhuangyuan Pu Hongxi very well.

Hou Jiankun, also a male actor, sings Hualian. His voice is loud and his posture is good.

Lu Qingyuan, a senior clown, is a disciple of Wang Changlin. Old people are worthless, and the fate of old actors is like this.

Business News

### The Financial Xiamen Gang's Momentum Does Not Weaken; Cash Falls First and Then Rises

Yesterday, the cash speculation on the black market fluctuated slightly. The situation rose and fell depending on the supply and demand. Although the silver shops and money exchange businesses all absorbed purchases on behalf of the Xiamen Gang, and some local wealthy people also came to participate, the market fell due to the continuous surge of gold shops and cash shops acting as vendors and multiple accounts. It once fell to a low of 2,070 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business showed renewed buying interest, and the sellers' willingness to supply weakened. The potential immediately reacted and returned to the high price of 2,075 yuan at the close of the day. As a result, it fell by two yuan. People's hearts in all quarters were very calm. The transaction was similar to the previous day, about 720 taels. The price of jewelry gold in silver shops fell by one yuan. There was no change in customs gold and Sino-British pure gold.

Speculation Only Down Two Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial opening was slightly weak due to the selling interest of gold shops and cash shops. The opening price was 2,075 yuan, which was 2 yuan lower than the previous closing, with the gold shop first selling 50 taels to the money exchange business. After the opening, the silver shop gang also sold 50 taels to the money exchange business at the same price as the morning opening. Subsequently, the cash shop sold 50 taels to the securities gang at a price of 73 yuan. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the money exchange business at the same price. Although gold shops and others still frequently sold, a certain money exchange business suddenly took the opportunity to absorb a large amount of purchases, so the situation turned flat. The gold shop sold a total of 150 taels to a certain money exchange business at a price of 72 yuan. Later, the cash shop and the silver shop gang also sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange business at the same price. After that, the buying interest of a certain money exchange business weakened, and the market situation declined slightly. The gold shop sold 50 taels to the silver shop gang at a price of 71 yuan. Before long, the money exchange business sold 50 taels to the silver shop gang at a price of 70 yuan. Later, the gold shops mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 71 yuan. Since there were only buyers and no sellers, there was no trading opening, so the closing price at noon was still 71 yuan. In the afternoon, the market rebounded due to the renewed buying interest of a certain money exchange business and the weakening of the gold shops' willingness to supply. The opening price immediately increased by four yuan. A certain money exchange business bought 50 taels from the gold shop at a price of 75 yuan. Subsequently, it bought 50 taels from the same industry at a price of 74 yuan. Later, it bought 50 taels from the silver shop gang again, with the closing price at night being 1,075 yuan. As a result, it fell by two yuan compared to the previous night's closing. The difference throughout the day was five yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 2,080 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,070 yuan. The current standard gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were no trading openings.

Jewelry Gold Fell by One Yuan

The initial exchange of jewelry gold in silver shops was unchanged, but at 10:40, the price was immediately reduced by one yuan due to the sudden decline in speculation. There have been no changes since then. The Datong Bank changed the price to 210 yuan, the Xinhe Bank to 208 yuan, and the purchase price to 202 yuan.

No Change in British Pure Gold

London, 27th telegram. British pure gold remained stable due to the stability of the pound. The price remained at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce. The Chinese cash purchase price of the central bank was also fixed at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed customs gold remained flat, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price was also unchanged at 1,207 yuan, 6 jiao, and 8 cents.

### Supply and Demand Match; Exchange Rate Remains Stable

Yesterday, the major foreign banks and British banks (acting as agents for Japanese banks), Chinese banks, Guangdong foreign banks, and Dutch banks continued to compete fiercely, but the exchange rate remained stable due to the competition of foreign banks such as HSBC to supply, which was sufficient to match supply and demand. As a result, all were flat. The transaction was still strong. Due to the selling interest of money exchange businesses, the Hong Kong exchange rate eased slightly after foreign banks absorbed it and were willing to supply.

At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar was one or two five longer for both near and far. The New York silver price remained stable. The London raw gold was also unchanged. The exchange rate of British to American, to Shanghai, and to French was flat. The exchange rate of American to British and to Shanghai was still flat, and it was one or two five longer to French. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 8 pence and 25 for the British exchange rate and 16 yuan and 0625 for the American liquor, both of which were unchanged compared to the previous night's closing. After the opening, although Chinese banks, foreign banks, and foreign firms scrambled to settle British gold, they were not affected because British banks, HSBC, and Mackay continued to supply steadily. Guangdong, Dutch, and foreign firms successively settled spot British cabinets of HSBC and Mackay at 8 pence and 25. The HSBC listing was not changed, and the silver balance tax was announced at 7 and a half, with a tax of 6.00%. Subsequently, the British bank, Youli, again absorbed a certain bank's spot American exchange rate of 16 yuan and 0625 on behalf of the Japanese banking sector. After that, the foreign firm also absorbed a certain bank's spot American exchange rate of 16 yuan and 0625, so the situation was stagnant. Near noon, the transaction turned clear, and the money exchange business slightly sold the Hong Kong exchange rate, selling spot Hong Kong exchange rates of 56 yuan and 55 yuan 875 to foreign banks and Dutch banks. The situation was also quite stable. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price, British and American exchange rates, was the same as the morning opening. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 55 yuan and 75.

In the afternoon, the foreign firm first came to settle HSBC's spot British exchange rate of 8 pence and 25. Subsequently, the British bank, Youli, continued to absorb Hua Bi's spot American exchange rate of 16 yuan and 0625 on behalf of Japan. The process remained stagnant. After entering, foreign banks, Dutch banks, and Hua Bi successively supplied spot Hong Kong exchange rates of 15 yuan 875 and 75 to foreign firms, with the situation slightly loosening and hardening. Until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price, the British exchange rate was 8 pence and 25, the American exchange rate was 16 yuan and 0625, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was 55 yuan 8125. As a result, compared to the previous night's closing, the British and American currencies were unchanged, and the Hong Kong exchange rate hardened by 0625.

### Regarding the Identity of Soybean Cake: A General Review of the Oil Cake Industry
### Most Chinese Oil Factories Have Fallen Along With Occupied Territories
### Only Two Factories Remain: Dayouyu and Dadeshin
### The Soybean Oil Market Has Lost Its Center of Gravity, Only Seeing Manipulation and Control
### Three Profits From One Transaction: An Unprecedentedly Huge Profit

Since this newspaper published articles regarding the identity of soybean cake, we have subsequently received a statement from the Oil Cake Industry Association on behalf of Dayouyu, which has been published in the previous two days' newspapers. However, this newspaper's business news maintains a fair stance. Having heard something, and then receiving a correction, this issue should provide readers with a clearer understanding so that black and white can be distinguished and public doubts can be dispelled. Therefore, we have investigated the situation with oil factory industry and obtained the following information:

Before August 13th, the business of oil pressing factories in this city was quite developed. Those located in Tanzi Bay and north of Caojia Bo Bang included Changji, Lide, Shenghelong, Dachangxin, Shunyu, Hengxingtai, and Suifeng, totaling seven factories. In Pudong, there were two factories: Dadeshin (located in Yangjiadu, specializing in soybean oil pressing) and Changde. Only two factories were located in the Public Concession: Dayouyu (also pressing soybean oil, etc.) and Dadeshin (this factory specialized in cottonseed oil pressing). The main products of each factory were soybean oil, soybean cake, cottonseed oil, and cottonseed cake. A portion also pressed coconut oil, rapeseed oil, and peanut oil, etc. After the outbreak of war, the factories in Bangbei and Pudong were unable to operate, and suffered significant losses in terms of property and business. The Dadeshin and Dayouyu factories suffered less damage because they were located in the safety zone, but their business was also temporarily suspended. It was not until around April of last year that the cottonseed portion of the business resumed operations. However, due to environmental factors and inconvenient transportation, there were concerns about the supply of raw materials. Furthermore, the dumping of duty-evading soybean oil on the market at that time greatly affected cottonseed oil prices. Therefore, operations were only maintained to keep the employees working.

Dayouyu was the larger of the two factories. In addition to using some of its products for its own purposes, it also pressed coconut oil for Dachangxin and pressed other vegetable oils for customers. The soybean cake portion of the business could not start operations at the same time because of scarce domestic soybean raw materials and high prices due to competition from the Cantonese traders, which made it unprofitable for the factory. It is understood that this soybean cake was mostly shipped to Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other places. Purchasers required that the raw materials be domestically produced. Although a large amount of duty-evading northeastern soybeans arrived at that time, and the prices were very low, the profits were substantial, it is said that the factory adhered to principles and did not purchase any. Subsequently, soybeans from Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Tongchonghai, and other places were shipped in relatively large quantities and were gradually purchased. Only from August of last year did a small part of the business resume operations, using 200 to 500 dan of soybeans per day, producing 400 to 1,000 pieces of cake. The average workload was only about one-tenth of what it was before the war. Southern China had a high demand for this domestic soybean cake, and there was often a shortage of supply. However, due to the limited availability of raw materials, work was intermittent, the output was small, and the price rose from 2.7 yuan to around 3.5 yuan. Starting this year, some merchants, because the factory's cake was insufficient to meet demand, ordered a large quantity of Dalian soybean cake from a certain merchant for sale in the occupied areas, priced at 3 yuan, which was profitable since the cake was slightly more expensive. However, due to the location, this Dalian cake could not be sold in southern China and eastern Zhejiang. Thus, some unscrupulous merchants, such as so-and-so, ordered tens of thousands of pieces of "Yuji" soybean cake, a counterfeit of Dayouyu's factory brand, from Dalian, in order to pass it off as domestic product and deceive customers. After Dayouyu factory discovered this, they published a warning in the newspaper and issued certificates of origin. Earlier this month, several thousand pieces of cake were shipped to Quanzhou on the Shanghai-bound Shenguang steamship, among which were some counterfeit cakes. Without distinguishing between genuine and fake, all were detained by the local authorities. Later, the municipal chamber of commerce sent a telegram to verify each one, and they were released. To this day, the official domestic soybean cake is inevitably affected by the counterfeit cake, and transactions are unusually slow. The sales in the occupied areas have been encroached upon by Dalian cake, because the cost of the factory's cake cannot be devalued to compete with it due to cost considerations, so legitimate merchants are greatly harmed.

The Changde oil factory in Pudong was originally operated by Chen Ziyi, a major grain merchant. After the Chinese army retreated westward, it was taken over by the Japanese Yoshida Trading Company. The factory was reopened by the company itself in the autumn of last year to specialize in pressing cottonseed oil. Starting this spring, the Tongsheng oil factory, which had been closed before the war, also used the factory to press soybean oil and soybean cake, with "Shengji" as the trademark for the cake. This soybean cake, also due to the raw material situation, can only be sold in the occupied areas. According to the market, Dalian cake with "Yuanji" and "Yuanji" brands are the most well-known, and there are also many miscellaneous cakes. Recently, it was heard that someone was shipping "Yuanji" cake to Xinghua, Fujian, in alarming quantities, and it is regrettable that the local area does not understand the source of the cake and is thus deceived.

Currently, the so-called soybean oil and soybean cake transactions on the market are all Dalian goods, so the factory's oil cake has no foothold. As for the Shunyu and Hengxingtai factories in Bangbei, there were rumors this spring that a certain merchant was seeking to cooperate in operating the cottonseed portion of the business, and had contacted the factories several times, but no agreement was reached. Later, the merchant planned to proceed alone, sending people to repair machinery and collect cottonseed. However, due to the small output of raw materials this spring and incomplete machinery, it has not yet started operations. The remaining factories, such as Suifeng, Changji, Shenghelong, Dachangxin, and Lide, are all in the war zone and cannot resume operations. Some, like Changji, have already been dissolved in effect. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the state of industry in this city is lamentable.

Since most of the Chinese oil factories cannot operate, and the small oil factories in the interior have no goods to ship, the sales in Shanghai completely rely on Dalian oil. Before the Chinese army retreated westward, Dalian oil could not be openly sold on the market, and was sold in a secretive manner. Since last year, Dalian oil has been sold openly and without restraint, and its momentum has become increasingly arrogant and unparalleled. Furthermore, the rise in oil prices has also been caused by the futures contracts thrown out by foreign firms, who then regretted their agreements when the contracts expired. Originally, they were supposed to deliver the full amount of goods upon expiration, but they only allowed for the delivery of 25%. Later, it was reduced to 20%, and most only delivered 18%. Since futures were not settled, the market became firm and expensive, and there was also manipulation from within. Since futures trading was not sustainable, it had to focus on spot trading. In reality, this spot was originally supposed to be the spot for settling futures. The spot price was higher than the futures price, and now selling spot again meant an additional profit. As a result, there were three profits from one transaction, and the profits were unprecedentedly generous. When ordering, oil, cake, and beans had to be ordered together, and none could be missing. When delivering, the sluggish soybean cake was still delivered according to the contract, so the price of the cake was lower, while the price of oil and beans was firm, because some were settled and some were not.

### Fire Machine Cotton: Selling Prices Continue to Decline
### Foreign Cotton Trading Halted

The cotton business remains as depressed as ever. However, the industry is pushing 1,500 bales of fire machine cotton. Selling prices continue to decline. Among them, one batch was priced at only 65.5 yuan, a body ratio compared to foreign cotton is inferior.

As for foreign cotton prices, the New York cotton market initially fell due to the settlement of May deliveries and foreign purchases. There were still some new transactions in the middle, so it did rebound once. As a result, the closing price was down 7 to 9 "bangxi" compared to the previous day. There will be many difficulties with the issue of U.S. cotton subsidies in the future. However, many parties are fearful of this plan, and all industries are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for Hitler's speech today. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell slightly, including forecasts, by 25 "luobi," Egyptian cotton rose 6 "bangyin," and Liverpool rose sharply by 10 "bangxi." Converted to legal tender, U.S. cotton fell by 4 "jiao" per dan, Indian cotton fell by 1 "jiao," and Egyptian cotton rose by 3 "jiao."

Although yarn prices have risen sharply in the Shanghai foreign cotton market, factories are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude in purchasing raw cotton, listening to Hitler's speech and waiting for a resolution to the U.S. cotton subsidy issue before determining their cotton purchasing strategy. Here are the translated factory prices for overseas cotton markets:

It is also inferior. However, the factories have completely stopped, and not a single bale has been purchased. The situation in the cotton market is inversely proportional to that in the yarn market. Not only can cotton prices not advance, but they have retreated. In fact, cotton of inferior quality, close to the plum rain season, is difficult to store for long, so it must be sold off at a low price. However, goods of this kind are still not willing to make much concessions on the selling price. 519 bales of cotton from northern Jiangsu arrived at Xiasa. Here are the current cotton conditions:

### "Counterfeit Currency" Plummets Frequently
### Worth Only 7.5 Jiao Legal Tender

Tianjin, 28th—The black market price of counterfeit "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" opened this morning down 1.5 yuan compared to the opening price on the morning of the 27th. 100 yuan in legal tender can buy 132 yuan in "Joint Reserve Bank Notes," meaning that 1 yuan in "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" is worth only 7.5757575 yuan in legal tender, an unprecedentedly low price. Checking yesterday's (28th) market price, it is down a huge 14 yuan and 7.5 "jiao" per 100 yuan compared to the Saturday (22nd) less than a week ago, meaning that the "Joint Reserve Bank Notes" have fallen from 80% to 70%, a drop of 1 "jiao" per yuan.

Most Foreign Currencies Firm and Expensive

Yesterday, foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds had abundant supply. Demand for British and American gold notes was still strong, and the supply of U.S. gold notes was not smooth, so prices continued to be firm and expensive. Demand for Hong Kong notes was very strong. Overseas Chinese and Belgian currencies were supplied by Qiantai, and the transaction volume was very large, so prices rose again. Demand for Singapore and Annam notes was also strong, and prices rose significantly. There was a supply of Italian notes, and the price fell slightly. Guild transactions were very rare. Hongchang sold 1,000 Italian notes from Zhenxingjin. Yesterday's market prices: U.S. gold notes rose by 2 "li," Hong Kong notes rose by 4 "li," Singapore notes rose by 1.8 "fen," Annam notes rose by 4 "fen," and Italian notes fell by 2 "li."

### Securities:
### Rally on Recapture of Nanchang.
### Domestic Bonds Show Excitement
### Foreign Stocks Await Hitler's Speech

The securities black market has gradually become firmer. Initially, the recapture of Nanchang boosted morale. Then, rumors that Hitler's declaration would not lead to war caused short sellers to panic. Cautious players covered their positions. In the afternoon, gold and cloth trading houses and financial institutions bought. The sluggish mood of the past few days was swept away. The market had a mostly excited tone. The actual effects of these expectations remain to be confirmed. Morning opened with Defu, Tongrun, Maoyongfeng and other brokerages buying. The market rotated, trending firmer. Qiafeng, Tiansheng, Zhenkang and #38 sold. Bids outnumbered asks. Midday was slightly better by one "jiao." After the midday rumors, buy orders surged. Defu continued to add to its position. Yongkang, Tongyu, Shuntai and #20 had demand. There were few sellers. Tongkang, Lianhe and Datong slightly shed positions. Buying dominated. Type C stocks hit three yuan. Further improvement expected. Market closed higher, between 3.5 and 5.5 jiao. Turnover approximately one million yuan. A summary follows:

Stock trades: Fifty shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange traded at 39.7 yuan.

The Tianjin dispatch in yesterday's paper incorrectly identified the Haihe Bonds as issued in 1914. They were issued in April 1918. Apologies.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that markets are paying close attention to international affairs and Hitler's speech. This is holding back trade and preventing market progress. Participants are directionless until the German leader speaks. Jardine shares were stable, trading ex-dividend at 17.7 yuan (adding back the 2.575 dividend equals 20.045 yuan). Land and Exploration fell to 7.5 yuan due to the impact of depreciating North China puppet currency on company profits. Ruirong shares were active around 6.9 yuan. Insurance shares remain thin and ignored.

London Far East Company's stock prices for 27 April (Thursday) showed no movement in either direction.

London Chinese foreign debt prices for 27 April (Thursday) were mixed. Crisp Loan rose 15 shillings to 36 pounds, 5 shillings. Reorganization Loan rose five shillings to 51 pounds. British-German loan fell one pound to 64 pounds. Vickers Aircraft Loan fell one-half pound to 16.5 pounds. All others unchanged.

Jardine Matheson Engineering (English branch) Ltd. will hold its 29th general meeting on 16 May. The board also decided to pay a dividend of one jiao per share for 1938.

### Grains: Flour Market Is Preparing
### Weak Exports Of 40,000 Bags

Factory Flour: Yesterday's flour market saw both domestic and foreign flour trending flat. Demand from outside merchants has gradually waned. Northern merchants were hesitant to buy because the value of Tianjin money has fallen sharply. Spot transactions also weakened. Southern merchants are still active. They demand lower prices. However, factory prices are still high due to elevated raw material costs since flour prices fell. Factories are unwilling to lower prices easily. Factory prices were still 4.445 yuan. #3 and #4 flours saw little change. Total volume traded was approximately 40,000 bags. The market is brewing. On the 29th, 1,000 bags were exported to Yantai, 26,100 bags to Tianjin, and 11,500 bags to Shantou.

Foreign Flour: Trending in line with domestic. Quotes for outside traders were still at US$2.60. New quotes were scarce and new deliveries delayed. Current foreign flour sales were still strong. Medium-quality brands were still around 4.445 yuan. The only activity was light retail on main street. Merchant demand nearly stopped. Buyers and sellers were equally reluctant to move. No major changes were expected in the short term.

### Already Controlling Oil and Beans
### Now Obstructing Rice and Grain

Shanghai Residents' Lives Are Getting Harder

Domestic Rice: Has not arrived in a while due to the closing of Changshu and Wuxi districts. Now we hear that someone is blocking Southern Merchants again, preventing all rice from flowing in. 2,000+ bags of Suzhou-Tong Merchants wrapped rice came by cart, but Suzhou is also considering banning shipments. Rice prices are soaring in Hangzhou and Shaoxing. Common rice wants 12 yuan per delivery. As a result, interior transporters from Ruofeng and Nan'gang have been transporting rice from Zhejing Province. Under these conditions, Shanghai's supplies are dwindling. The market and merchants are insightful, but the warm weather causes rice quality to decline. Most are unwilling to buy. As a result, medium and fine rice ticked up slightly. Du Yang and others rice was tight. All other rice was flat.

Customer Scented Rice: After several days of purchases by the Ningbo merchants, the market rose. Main street store owners were reluctant and watched from the sidelines. Yesterday, Ningbo demand weakened. The market briefly flattened. However, main street stores used the opportunity to buy. In total, between 3,000 and 4,000 bags traded. Medium rice grew popular. High-gloss and low-quality rice were unaffected. Cart shipments were rare, but river shipments totaled between 4,000 and 5,000 bags as Shanghai reported price rises, and merchants moved to capture the gains.

### Yarn
### Speculation Is Heating Up
### Cash Yarn Is Marching Forward
### Double Horse Peaks At 424 Yuan
### Up Over 60 Yuan Since Last Month's Low

The yarn market continues to rise, and the rally looks set to accelerate. The market is lively. According to public opinion, recent battlefield victories, including the recapture of Bochang, and the fall of the Japanese puppet currency have drawn speculators into the market. As a result, the market is growing and buying. Sellers are reluctant to sell. The market temporarily lacks shares. The rally is in full swing. A portion of the market surveyed said that the bulk of buyers were stockpiling and re-warehousing. Few were shipping for export. There is a shortage of space on transports, and sales channels are narrow. As a result, most trades involve buying and selling. The afternoon rally was fierce. 20-count Double Horse Yarn continued to advance. Prices peaked at 424 yuan, up 9.5 yuan from the previous day. Prices were as low as 363.5 yuan on 25 March. The new peak represents a gain of over 60.5 yuan. Prudence is required as we look ahead.

Cash Yarn: Opened higher, taking advantage of the previous day's gains, rising 1 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was quoted at 408 yuan. Soon, strong buying and rumors emerged. The market continued to climb. 20-count Double Horse rose to 420 yuan. Quoted at 411.5 yuan. Prices then fell as winners took profits. Cash Double Horse was 417 yuan. Quoted at 408 yuan. By the close, prices had risen 1-2 yuan. Buying dominated the afternoon open. The only trading partners were peers. Some large investors sold, but this could not stem the buying wave. At close, the 20-count cash price was 424 yuan. Quoted at 416 yuan. An estimated 3,020 bales changed hands. Price increases for 20-count Double Horse and Heavenly Maiden yarns were in the 8-9.5 yuan range. Tejin City was up 8.5 yuan. All others rose 3, 4 and 5 yuan. Sunchongxin Factory quoted 200 bales of Da Fa (May delivery) at prices ranging from 392 to 400 yuan. Unification Factory quoted 350 bales of 20-count Golden Chicken (May delivery) at 407 yuan, and 400 bales of 12-count Golden Chicken at 345 yuan. Yongan Factory quoted 100 bales of 20-count Tejin City (May delivery) at 420 yuan. XInhe Factory quoted 120 bales of 20-count Five Sons at 398 yuan. Daily yarn exports totaled 870 items to Tianjin, 225 items to Shantou and 150 items to Hong Kong. Volumes for each trading partner are listed below.

The Japanese yarn market opened flat, but rallied strongly in the afternoon. Rumors say that Tianjin and Qingdao merchants were stockpiling due to the fall in the Japanese puppet currency to avoid losses. Actual shipments are few.

### Piece Goods:
### A Rush To Buy More
### East Piece Goods Are Rising
### Daily Transactions Top 4,000 Items
### Domestic White Cloth Is Also Selling

Domestic Cloth:

Heavy demand for fine cotton. Stockpilers pushed forcefully. The market grew tighter. Mornings rose 5 fen to 1 jiao. Afternoons rose by another jiao. Roughly 500 bales of British Jardine's coarse cloth were sold. China Merchants Dasheng Zhenzhong each sold 200+ bales of innerwear cloth. Dapeng fine cloth rose 2.5 jiao. Fuguifu fine cloth hand goods sold for 14 yuan. Fuguifu fine twill hand goods were 12.9 yuan. Other brands were up over 1 jiao. Factory quotes were roughly 2.5 jiao above the market. Approximately 200 bales of fine and fine twill cloths traded. Bleached cloth sales were weak. As a result, prices did not keep pace with base cloth. Dye factories stockpiled. They hoped to realize better prices later. Investors tried to buy low-priced goods on the market. Seller quotes were uniformly 3-5 jiao higher. Hand goods were 5 jiao to 1 yuan cheaper than factory direct. As a result, no new quotes were formally released. Main street demand was strong. Merchants from Kunming and Chongqing bought 3,000+ pieces of dyed fine cloth. Ganzhou Merchants from Guangfeng (Jiangxi) bought 700+ pieces of colored cloth and chintz. Merchants from Northern Jiangsu and Bengbu bought 30-40 bales of fine cloth. Colored cloth and silk purchased numbered 2,000+.

East Cloth:

Yesterday's fine cloth quotes rose directly. Merchant buyers became more aggressive. Besides continued, strong demand from Northern Merchants, main street financiers were hoarding East Piece Goods as domestic goods were scarce. Total volume of fine and fine twill cloth was above 4,000 items. Northern Merchant purchases totaled approximately 60-70%. Prices rose 2 jiao-1 jiao. Sunrise fine cloth cash was 14.25 yuan. Quoted 14.5 yuan for futures. Fine twill was 13.25 yuan. Quoted 13.5 yuan for futures. Five Blessings fine (next month) was 13.35 yuan. Precious baby fine twill must be 13 yuan. The market continued to soar.

Exports:

Piece goods exports totaled 380 items to Tianjin, 65 items to Hong Kong on the 29th.

### Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Drops Another Yuan
### Crude Oil Trading Has Not Started
### Soybean Cake Spot Sales Not Moving

Crude Oil: Yesterday's scattered sentiment prevented trading from occurring.

Soybean Oil fell another yuan. Japan Merchants continue to import Dalian Oil. As a result, the market was battered again. 100 barrels of Dalian crude oil traded at prices ranging from 45.85 yuan to 45.5 yuan. 400+ barrels of seven-day delivery traded at 44 yuan to 43.5 yuan. 50 pieces of small basket Dalian oil were 44 yuan. 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were 32.5 yuan.

Soybean Oil Imports on 28 April totaled 1,240 items from Tianjin, and 85 items from Yantai.

The soybean cake market continues to see trade of Large Bean Cake, but Swedish Cake sales were slow, and this is impacting morale. Futures fell. There was volatility. Prices ranged 9 jiao. The highest price was significantly higher than the previous day. For May delivery, 1,000 pieces of Yuan Ji Cake traded at 2.91 yuan. 7,000 pieces of mixed cake traded at prices ranging from 2.97 to 2.88 yuan. For June delivery, 8,000 pieces of Yuan Ji Cake fell from 3.11 to 3.02 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Longan and Flowers Are Scarce

Longan trades have not been smooth in recent times, and trading houses have not engaged in transactions for a long time. According to production prices, such as those from Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou, the reported prices are all inverted. As a result, trading houses are unable to open for business, and there is no intention to buy more goods. The position of each trading house is narrow, and none dare to buy much. However, according to recent correspondence, the new flowers are uniformly bad. Zhangzhou is at 20-30%. Quanzhou is at 20%. Xinghua is at 30%. There is still a long way to go before harvest. If weather damages the harvest, the production total could decrease further. There remains room for change.

Traffic and Transportation Weekly

### A Bird's-Eye View of Rangoon

— Xun

Since the completion of the Burma Road, through diligent preparations by the authorities, it will soon be officially open to traffic, connecting with the Burmese railway to form a major international transportation line for our country. Consequently, Rangoon in British Burma and Haiphong in French Annam share equal importance. Currently, major Chinese banks, trading firms, and transportation agencies have already established offices there. It is anticipated that the city will experience even greater development in the near future. As Rangoon serves as a key hub for our country's foreign trade, it is essential to document all aspects of the city.

Rangoon is situated on the delta of the Irrawaddy River, twenty-four miles from the river mouth. The port is 2,400 yards wide and four and a half miles long, allowing ships to enter and exit freely. The wharf is 3,332 feet long, and the floating bridge wharf is over 600 feet long. All imported goods are unloaded at the wharf and then transported inland via railway or the Irrawaddy River. Exported goods are transported by barge to large ships moored in the harbor, which then carry them to commercial ports in various countries. Rangoon's main imports include machinery, silk, chemicals, sugar, salt, linen, and fish. The primary exports are rice, tea, timber, cotton, lead, silver, zinc, copper, rubber, and gravel.

The city of Rangoon features a European style, with wide roads, American-style buildings, grand bank and commercial buildings, European-style hotels, and numerous famous temples and pagodas. The climate is tropical, with an average annual temperature of around 85 degrees Celsius. November to March is the coolest period, with temperatures rising sharply at the end of March and beginning of April, making April the hottest month. May to October is the rainy season, characterized by a very humid and sultry climate. As you approach Rangoon harbor by ship, the initial view of a flat, muddy landscape may disappoint you, but the scenery within Rangoon is truly beautiful. The most famous landmark is the Shwe Dagon Pagoda, which stands 368 feet tall and gleams with gold. It is visible from dozens of miles away, especially when viewed amidst the surrounding lush greenery, creating a truly captivating sight. Visitors constantly flock to the pagoda to pay their respects. Other notable attractions include Dalhousie Park, Royal Lakes (seven miles from the city), the large prison, the Oriental Market, and the government lumberyard where elephants are used for transportation, all of which are worth visiting.

According to the 1933 statistics, Rangoon has a population of 400,415 people. Over 50,000 Chinese nationals reside in the city, primarily from Fujian and Guangdong provinces, who mainly operate in the rice and timber industries. Besides the Fujianese and Cantonese, there are also many Yunnanese who are mostly engaged in the gemstone trade. There are several Chinese primary and secondary schools, as well as several Chinese newspapers. The Chinese Consulate General and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce are also located here, wielding considerable influence. Furthermore, the Burmese government does not impose any particularly harsh regulations on overseas Chinese in Burma, which is much better than many other Southeast Asian ports.

There are three land routes from Rangoon to Yunnan Province in China. The main route involves taking the North Burma Railway train from Rangoon to Katha, then to Bhamo, and then taking a car to the Chinese-Burmese border town of Wanting (just 170 kilometers from Bhamo). From there, one follows the Burma Road through Longling, Baoshan, Yongping, Xiaguan, and Chuxiong to reach Kunming. The other two routes are: one, taking a train from Rangoon via Mandalay to Lashio, then by car through Namhkam into southern Yunnan Province; and two, taking a train from Rangoon to Myitkyina to Pianma in Yunnan Province.

Regarding the shipping routes from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Rangoon, there are no direct routes from Shanghai. One can first take a ship on any route to Hong Kong or Singapore and then transfer to Rangoon. The British India Steam Navigation Company (B.I.S.N. Co., Ltd.—Apcarline) has ships departing from Hong Kong to Rangoon every two weeks, stopping at Singapore, Penang, and other ports, taking fourteen days. From Singapore to Rangoon, it only takes seven days. The fare from Hong Kong to Rangoon is £24 for first class and £16 for second class. The procedures for traveling to Rangoon require first obtaining a passport from the issuing authority of the Chinese government, which must then be approved by the British Consulate before departure.

### Points to Note for Goods Shipped to Haiphong

— Baotai

In the past, Haiphong was not a major trading port, and the volume of imports and exports was far less than it is now. Warehouse facilities were inadequate, and management was less than satisfactory. Now that it has suddenly become an important international transportation hub, not only is warehouse space insufficient, leading to congestion, but the lack of improved management practices has resulted in significant problems with inventory disorder. Additionally, Haiphong's customs clearance procedures are exceptionally complicated. Many shipments from various locations have been delayed or suffered accidental losses because merchants are unfamiliar with the actual conditions in Haiphong, or because of incomplete documentation, or unclear declarations. Based on my observations, I will briefly describe the points to note below:

Packing List: The more detailed, the better. Haiphong's customs tariffs are exceptionally strict and detailed. Even a slight error in application or omission in listing can lead to violations of regulations. Whether goods shipped to Haiphong are listed in Chinese or English, they must be translated into French. The most inconvenient situation arises when a package contains items of different categories (such as hardware, daily necessities, and other miscellaneous items). If a packing list is not attached, or if it is incomplete, the package must be opened, and the goods must be carefully categorized and a list must be prepared. If there are special items whose names cannot be determined, they must be researched repeatedly. This process is very time-consuming, often causing delays of several days. Therefore, it is best to ship one type of item per package. If it is not practically possible to do so, and a package contains several types of items, the sender must prepare a packing list with as much detail as possible. The packing list should include: (1) marks and package numbers, (2) the correct name of the goods, (3) weight and volume (in metric units per item), and (4) type of packaging. If these four items are provided, there should be no problems with customs clearance in Haiphong. Furthermore, when shipping goods to Haiphong in batches, it is often necessary to ship them in separate shipments due to vehicle constraints. Therefore, a packing list must be prepared for each package, with three copies per list. One copy should be kept in Shanghai, and the remaining copies should be sent to Haiphong for use.

Solid Packaging: Theft in Haiphong has become an open secret. If packages are sturdy, losses can be minimized. The most suitable size for ordinary packages is a volume of 20 cubic feet and a weight of 200 kilograms. Packages exceeding these dimensions are inconvenient to stack and are easily damaged. It is rumored that Haiphong workers, accustomed to handling Yunnan tin ingots, treat all goods as if they were as hard as tin ingots, often dropping them from high places. It is rare for such packages to remain unbroken. Therefore, in addition to making wooden boxes from high-quality wood, two iron straps should be added after customs clearance in Shanghai for protection (ordinary iron straps are usually arranged in a cross shape; parallel straps provide even greater protection). For valuable goods, a lead-lined box should be made inside the wooden box and sealed with solder for added security. For soft packages such as cotton yarn and cotton cloth, attention should be paid to whether the outer packaging is damaged during loading. If damaged, it should be repaired immediately. In short, the better the packaging, the fewer the losses.

The two points mentioned above are common sense, but because they are common sense, they are easily overlooked. The delays in shipping dates and losses due to theft are incalculable. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare in advance before shipment. Fortunately, these measures are easy to implement; they only require a little preparation before shipment. Currently, Haiphong warehouses are frequently reported to be full. Several new warehouses are under construction, but it will take some time for them to be completed. Therefore, Taikoo and Jardine still have strict restrictions on goods shipped to Haiphong. When ships arrive in Haiphong, the cargo often needs to be unloaded onto barges due to warehouse congestion, and then gradually moved into the warehouse. This process can take several days or even a month. It is said that Taikoo and Jardine have temporarily suspended accepting goods for transshipment to Haiphong for this reason. Some merchants, aware of the difficulties in shipping, often carry goods in their luggage when traveling to Haiphong themselves. However, Haiphong customs regulations strictly prohibit new goods in personal luggage. If discovered, they will be confiscated, and fines may even be imposed. This is something that must be paid attention to.

### Hotel Perspectives

— Ye Wujie

1.  Saving on repair costs shortens the lifespan of hotel buildings.
2.  Fawning and flattering service does not make guests comfortable.
3.  Guests talking and laughing loudly, disturbing the peace of other guests, is not a right to be enjoyed.
4.  A rural hotel built next to a highway, disturbed by daily traffic noise, will inevitably decline in business.
5.  The American travel and hotel industry is expected to develop even further in 1939 due to the expositions in New York and San Francisco.
6.  To promote the development of hotel business, one should maintain the cleanliness of the premises, strictly maintain order, provide cheerful service, and offer reasonable room rates.
7.  Guests who wish to enjoy the right to quiet can hang a "Do not disturb" sign on their door. Even if there is a telephone, the attendant will not inform them of calls. This is a modern hotel service.
8.  Hotel staff should strive for the improvement of the hotel, not just personal gain.
9.  Gentle and courteous service can earn twice the goodwill from guests. Hotel employees should deeply consider this.
10. The origin of tips comes from the coffee shops of the past. A wooden box was hung on the wall with the words "To Insure Promptness" written on it. If guests were satisfied, they could voluntarily toss a reward into the box. The first letter of each word forms the currently popular acronym TIP. (Translated from The Hotel Monthly)

### Notes on Inland Highways (Continued)

— Jing Xun

The entire route from Guiyang to Changsha is 1,009 kilometers long. The highway journey takes four days by car. Since the section from Yuanling to Changsha began using diesel-powered vehicles, the journey has become slower, adding one day to the overall travel time. I will now describe the lodging and dining situation along the way:

Day 1: Depart from Guiyang to Huangping, a distance of 190 kilometers. Purchasing tickets from Guiyang to Changsha is not as crowded as the northern and western routes. Registering the day before is enough to secure a seat. After departing, lunch is taken at Machangping. Arriving at Huangping around 4:00 PM, the city sits high on a mountain and is very basic, lacking any large shops or restaurants. The China Travel Service operates a special guesthouse, the Xinghua Hotel, which charges 60 cents for one night and two meals. There are also ten renovated berths available for 70 cents each. Day 2: From Huangping to Huang County, a distance of 200 kilometers, the journey takes eight and a half hours. Lunch is taken in Zhenyuan. After passing Zhenyuan, the route goes through Xiangzi Ridge and Panshan, where the road winds precariously through the mountains. Arriving in Huang County, one can stay at the special guesthouse, the Southwest Hotel, with room rates ranging from 60 cents to 1.60 yuan. The Huang County market is entirely on Zhongshan Street, with foreign goods stores and the vegetable market located there. The street is relatively clean. Day 3: From Huang County to Yuanling, a distance of 238 kilometers, the journey takes eight hours. Lunch is taken in Huaihua. After the car crosses the Chenxi ferry, it takes two or three hours to reach Yuanling. Yuanling, also known as Chenzhou, has a good market with stone-paved streets. The special guesthouse, the Zhuyuan Hotel, is very clean, with prices ranging from 60 cents to 1.40 yuan. Day 4: From Yuanling to Changde, lunch is taken in Guanzhuang. The route passes through Qingshan Gang, with a treacherous road and steep cliffs. The journey is very dangerous. Arriving in Changde, one can stay at the Min'an Hotel next to the bus station, which charges only 60 cents for one night and two meals. Changde is not a large city, and commerce is not thriving, with the market concentrated along Zhongshan Road. Day 5: From Changde to Changsha, lunch is taken in Yiyang, and one can arrive in Changsha in the afternoon. It is understood that this section of the highway is currently closed to traffic, so the eastern section of the Southwest Highway only goes as far as Changde. The fare from Guiyang to Changsha is 44.40 yuan, and to Changde, it is 36.30 yuan. Luggage under 20 kilograms is free, and each additional 5 kilograms costs 3.027 yuan. (The itinerary from Changde to Guiyang is the reverse.)

### Travel Inquiries

Mr. Yang Saiqiu asked about transportation conditions from Shanghai to Kelantan:

(Answer) To get to Kelantan, first take a ship to Singapore. The second-class fare on Italian ships is usually £14 in British currency, and the economy second-class is £10. The second-class fare on French ships is £15, and third class is £9. The journey takes seven or nine days. After arriving in Singapore, you can take a train to Kelantan. The second-class fare is 14.11 Straits dollars, and the third-class fare is 9.39 Straits dollars. If you do not take the train, you can take the Straits Steamship Company ship, which departs every Saturday and takes five days. The fare is 45 Straits dollars.

Messrs. Chen Li, Hu Xin, Li Haoran, Yang Zhengbo, and Wang Jian asked about the routes from Shanghai to Xi'an and Lanzhou:

(Answer) To go to Shaanxi and Gansu, under the current circumstances, you can only take the route through Vietnam, then through Kunming, Guiyang, Chongqing, and Chengdu to reach Xi'an. After arriving in Xi'an, take the Xilan Highway to Lanzhou. The total travel cost from Shanghai to Xi'an is 226.75 Chinese yuan (excluding first-class ship cabins and third-class train accommodations). The cost from Xi'an to Lanzhou is 26.25 yuan. The total travel time is 25 days (longer if waiting for transportation is required).

Mr. Wen Jizhong asked about the situation in Yan'an and Xunyi:

(Answer) After arriving in Xi'an, you can take the Xilan Highway to Bin County, which is 148 kilometers away. The fare is 6.7 yuan. There is no highway between Bin County and Xunyi. Fortunately, the distance is only a few dozen kilometers, so you can walk or use other means of transportation. There is no formal transportation service from Xi'an to Yan'an, so travelers usually walk together.

Ms. Shi Fujin asked about the conditions of fourth-class trains on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway:

(Answer) From Haiphong to Kunming, the fourth-class fare is 10.684 Vietnamese piasters per person, equivalent to 18.1 Chinese yuan. You must take care of your own luggage. When overweight luggage is marked, it costs over 16 Vietnamese piasters per 100 kilograms.

Messrs. Hu Guifen, Luo Hanlin, Zhang Yanfu, Yan Ying, Yu Yizhen, Ge Jianpei, Shi Yiling, Lin Hansui, Wei Shaopu, Lin Zilun, Ou Zhe, Chen Duanlu, Gu Da, Tie Qi, Wu Jiaxun, Wu Liangqing, Hua, etc. asked about the routes from Shanghai to Hunan and Guangxi, and to Yunnan and Chongqing:

(Answer) Since the ports of Zhenhai and Wenzhou have been closed, it is impossible to take the route through the ports of eastern Zhejiang. Aside from this, many are taking the route through Fuzhou, Shantou, or Guangzhou to reach the interior in order to avoid using passports and save travel expenses. However, according to investigations, the highways within Fujian Province are passable, but those outside Fujian Province have been closed to traffic. The highways near Shantou have also been interrupted. The highway from Guangzhou Bay to Yulin has also been cut off. Considering all of the above routes, although one can risk traveling them, it is ultimately not as convenient as taking the route through Vietnam. For information about this route and detailed information, please refer to the third issue of this publication. Regarding Mr. Gu's inquiry about reaching Jianshi in Hubei, you can reach it after arriving in Chongqing, and ... to Qianjiang ....

### Rangoon Entry Procedures

— Junxin

Regarding the entry procedures for Chinese nationals into Rangoon, the capital of British Burma, I will describe what I have recently learned, as follows: Checking the procedures for overseas Chinese entering Rangoon are still relatively convenient. Whether it is a first-time arrival or a return trip, and regardless of whether they are in first class or lower class, all those entering Rangoon must carry a passport from the Chinese government, and after it is inspected by the Rangoon Port Police Department without any errors, they can disembark. If the passport they carry has not been certified by the British Consul stationed in various places or by the Singapore Passport Bureau, they may be refused to disembark and asked to return on the original ship. According to what I have heard, overseas Chinese often make mistakes due to unclear procedures. The major reasons for these errors are as follows:

(1) Assuming that they can enter as long as they have a passport issued by the Chinese government, they often fail to have it certified by the British Consul or the Singapore Passport Bureau.

(2) Even if they have been certified, they often do not pay attention to the validity period and are refused entry because the validity period has already expired.

(3) Sometimes, when exporting from China or Singapore, the validity period is already close to expiring, and they do not know to apply for additional certification, causing it to become invalid when they arrive in Rangoon.

(4) When overseas Chinese from Burma return to China or other British or Dutch territories and then return to Burma, they often mistakenly believe that their passport is valid for both outbound and return trips, and they do not ask the British Consul or relevant government to certify it. They are only turned back when they arrive in Rangoon.

In summary, anyone going to Rangoon must obtain a Chinese passport and pay close attention to certification by the British Consul or other relevant authorities. Extra attention should be paid to the validity period to avoid being rejected at the last minute.
