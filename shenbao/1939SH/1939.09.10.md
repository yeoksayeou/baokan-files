### Fierce Attacks by German Land and Air Forces; Warsaw Surrounded on Three Sides; Defense Commander Vows to Defend to the End; Berlin Broadcast Claims Capture, Poland Denies

Warsaw – General Czuma, the defense commander of the Polish capital, Warsaw, broadcast a message via radio to Polish troops today, urging them to prevent the capture of Warsaw by the enemy and to avenge the deaths of the Polish people. He stated, "Our Commander-in-Chief has entrusted us with the heavy responsibility of defending Warsaw. We hope that the enemy's pressure outside the city of Warsaw will be crushed by our troops. Soldiers, we cannot abandon our current line of defense. We must tell the enemy that they cannot advance any further. We must avenge our brothers and sisters who died in the war." Female workers in Warsaw have formed women's battalions to assist the defending soldiers. Colonel Lipinski, commenting on General Czuma's declaration, stated, "Our troops must defend Warsaw to the end, until the last man." (September 9th, Associated Press)

London – At 2:01 this morning, a shortwave broadcast from Berlin to the residents of Warsaw was intercepted, stating that the enemy had surrounded Warsaw on three sides and could enter the city by morning. Residents were urged to remain calm, and all stores were advised not to open for business tomorrow. (September 9th, Reuters)

London – According to Polish Radio, German forces have not yet occupied Warsaw. Fighting is taking place around the city. The Polish Embassy in London states that reports of Warsaw's fall are absolutely untrue and that the threat to Warsaw is not as serious as yesterday. The bridges over the Vistula River in Warsaw have been hit by bombs, but traffic within the city is normal. All radio stations are still broadcasting and have not been shut down. Street fighting is taking place in the northeastern and southwestern suburbs, approximately five miles from the city center. (September 9th, Reuters)

Paris – The official Polish radio station broadcast from Warsaw in French, denying reports that German forces had entered Warsaw yesterday. This broadcast was aired at 8:30 PM on Friday (4:30 AM Saturday, Shanghai time), three and a half hours after the Germans claimed to have captured Warsaw. The broadcast stated that Warsaw's defenses had been completed but acknowledged that the city's situation was becoming increasingly dangerous. It was reported that the city's 120,000 residents are now preparing to be besieged, with streetcars, furniture, and other items being used for defensive purposes. Landmines have been planted throughout the suburbs to prevent the German army from advancing rapidly. Although air raids occur frequently, residents show no signs of panic. German planes bombed the city twice today in an attempt to destroy the bridges across the Vistula River, but were unsuccessful. Two German pilots were forced to parachute down. Residents mobilized to help dig trenches. All roads into the city have defensive structures built. The situation in the city is excellent, stores are still open for business as usual, and streetcars are running on their regular schedules. During the bombing on Thursday, Polish defenders shot down nine German fighter planes and one bomber. (September 9th, Associated Press)

London – The Polish Embassy here states that Berlin's claim that German mechanized units entered Warsaw at 5:01 PM last night is completely untrue. At 8:35 PM, when German planes were attacking Warsaw, the Polish Embassy in London was still in contact with the Polish capital. Germany announced the capture of Warsaw at 5:01 PM, but at 7:15 PM, the mayor of Warsaw broadcast from the Warsaw radio station, urging the people to dig trenches and prepare to defend the capital. At 7:55 PM, there were still air raid warnings and anti-aircraft fire. The Warsaw defense commander also issued a forecast of an impending air raid. Therefore, Berlin's claim of having entered Warsaw is clearly untrue. (September 9th, Reuters)

Berlin – According to the German official news agency, the German High Command announced that the vanguard of the German army had reached Gora Kalwaria, 15 miles southeast of Warsaw. Simultaneously, German forces operating on the southern front had reached Sandomierz, 50 miles southwest of the new Polish capital, Lublin. Both locations are situated along the Vistula River. Sandomierz is the location of Poland's newest armaments factory.

New York – According to a radio broadcast received here today from London, although German forces have not yet entered Warsaw, fierce street fighting is taking place between German and Polish troops in the suburbs southwest of Warsaw (five miles from the city center). (September 9th, Associated Press)

Berlin – According to official sources tonight at 9:00 PM, German mechanized units and other forces entered Warsaw at 5:15 PM this afternoon. (August 8th, Huitong News Agency)

Berlin – According to the German Supreme Military Authority, although German troops have invaded the city center of Warsaw from the south, they have not yet occupied the entire city as of this morning. Therefore, it cannot be said that Warsaw has fallen into German hands. Consequently, local newspapers, which in their first edition used the headline "Warsaw Has Been Conquered," changed the headline in the second edition to "German Troops Have Reached Warsaw." It is anticipated here that there will be a major battle on the eastern bank of the Vistula River. According to observers familiar with current affairs, if the German army can maintain its current rate of advance, the German military campaign against Poland could end in a few weeks. At that point, Mussolini will undoubtedly propose peace talks again. It is said that the current climate in Poland is clear and dry, which is conducive to the operations of German mechanized units. It is believed that this climate will not change until October, so Germany is determined to exploit the strengths of its mechanized units within this month. (September 9th, Associated Press)

Warsaw – The General Headquarters has just released a communiqué, stating, in brief, that our army units, transportation lines, and bridges across the Vistula River are still being bombed by German aircraft. The city center of Warsaw and certain other towns have also been bombed. However, our troops and anti-aircraft units are responding effectively, and German aircraft have suffered considerable losses. In addition, German motorized units are fiercely attacking in the areas of Łódź, Piotrków, Tomaszów, Rawa Mazowiecka, and Pułtusk on the central and southern fronts. Our troops have been forced to retreat. (August 8th, Havas)

Warsaw – The Polish General Staff issued a communiqué stating that German aircraft are bombing Polish transportation lines and Warsaw has been repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft. In retaliation, the Polish Air Force bombed German armored vehicle columns and used anti-aircraft guns to shoot down several enemy aircraft. Under the combined attack of German mechanized units and the air force, Polish troops were forced to retreat to a line extending from Łódź, Piotrków Trybunalski, Tomaszów Mazowiecki, Kielce, Tarnów, and Pułtusk, resisting step by step along the way, and not lightly giving up an inch of ground. (September 9th, Associated Press)

London – A Polish journalist recently broadcast from Warsaw via radio about the current situation in Warsaw, stating that German forces are now only a short distance from the capital. The everyday life of the cafes no longer exists, but another type of cafe has emerged in its place: street-side coffee stalls where weary soldiers returning from the front gather to eat. Cars are constantly traveling east out of the city. 150,000 volunteers of all levels are working hard in the western suburbs to build trenches, set up tank traps, and erect obstacles. (September 9th, Reuters)

### Polish Military Strategy: Shorten the Front, Await the Opportunity for a Counterattack

Beijing – According to news from Belgium, the Netherlands, and other sources, Polish troops are continuing to retreat in an orderly fashion for strategic reasons. According to neutral military observers, the Polish army cannot withstand the larger German army along a 1,600-mile-long front and is deliberately shortening the front line. News from both Poland and Berlin clearly indicates that the Polish retreat is neither panicked nor demoralized. Military experts predict that General Smigly-Rydz, the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish army, will soon issue an order to defend key positions and build trenches. The General retreated 600 miles when resisting the Red Army in 1920 and then launched a successful counterattack, so he has considerable experience with this tactic. There has been no major battle between the German and Polish armies, and the German army has captured very few Polish soldiers and weapons, indicating the thoroughness of General Smigly-Rydz's strategy. It is widely believed that most of the Polish army has not yet entered the battlefield, and thousands of Polish light tanks have not yet been deployed. The German army is advancing on terrain as flat as a billiard table and is greatly aided by the current favorable weather. It is predicted that when the weather changes in the autumn and the terrain becomes rugged, the effectiveness of German motorized units will be greatly reduced. It is said that Polish sources claim, "The German army still does not know how to fight." The various agencies of the Polish government have apparently dispersed to several small towns, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic corps are located in the new capital, Lublin, southeast of Warsaw.

### Polish Isolated Forces: Heroic Resistance; Bloody Battle Lasts Seven Days and Nights; Soldiers Sacrificing Themselves Heroically

Zurich, Switzerland – Westerplatte Island, located on the left side of the city of Danzig, originally garrisoned by Polish troops, has now been captured by German forces. The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent describing the heroic resistance of the isolated Polish forces, with many moving and inspiring details. It is reported that the Polish garrison consisted of only 120 men. After the outbreak of war between Germany and Poland, German forces launched a fierce attack from land, sea, and air. The Polish troops fought bravely. The German Marines launched two attacks under the cover of the cruiser "Schleswig-Holstein" (docked outside the port of Danzig) but were repulsed each time. The German army then deployed a large number of volunteers from the city of Danzig and National Socialist Party troops as reinforcements, set fire to the forest in front of the Polish fortress, bombarded the fortress walls with concentrated artillery fire, and then launched a fierce attack with flamethrowers and mortars, as well as bombing by multiple aircraft. At that time, the Polish troops were running out of food and water, but they continued to resist bravely for a total of seven days and nights. Of these, 55 officers and soldiers died of their wounds one after another. Eventually, outnumbered, they raised a white flag to surrender. When the German army entered the peninsula, they discovered that there were only 65 officers and soldiers remaining in the Polish army, which caused everyone to marvel. (August 8th, Havas)

### After the Battle of Bromberg: Utter Devastation; Broken Walls, Collapsed Walls, and Piles of Corpses; Evidencing the Intensity of the Street Fighting

German Front Lines in the Corridor – A reporter has just left Bromberg, where he saw only ruined buildings with bullet holes covering the walls, and dead bodies of old and young scattered on the ground. The dead included men and women from fourteen to seventy years old, all of whom were brutally murdered by the Polish army during their retreat. The reporter saw twenty-five corpses in the forty-mile journey, German soldiers entering Bromberg found the city in complete chaos. This was followed by extremely fierce street fighting, with Polish troops setting fire to many houses to resist German troops, using doors and windows as strongholds. Before the Polish army retreated and before the German army arrived, German people were massacred. In an open space, the reporter saw the bodies of twelve men and women. According to a German officer, they were all Germans who were killed by the Polish army while trying to flee. The reporter saw only fifteen, but according to German officers, the total number of Germans killed was approximately eight hundred, and that Polish civilians also participated in this atrocity. The reporter also saw several young Poles being led away under the supervision of German soldiers, who were said to be participants in this atrocity. The reporter inquired whether they would be executed immediately. The German officer replied, "From what you have just seen, you should know what we will do to them." (September 9th, Associated Press)

### General Göring Delivers a Speech

Berlin – General Göring, the German Minister of Aviation and Premier of Prussia, recently delivered a speech stating that Germany was the victim of aggression and boasting of the German army's invincibility. He said that he expected the Polish army to be annihilated by the German side within a few days and that the entire cleanup would take no more than four weeks. Germany will safeguard its border with France, and unless attacked first, Germany will never attack others. Göring also addressed British Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying that Germany is prepared for peace and that the power of life and death is now entirely in his hands. However, the Treaty of Versailles will never be seen again. (September 9th, Reuters)

Berlin – German Aviation Minister General Göring stated today that the German war against Poland could end in a few weeks. Finally, Göring warned Britain, France, and other countries, stating in brief that Germany will soon transfer seventy German divisions to reinforce the four fronts. (September 9th, Associated Press)

### Air Raid Alarm Sounds in Berlin

Berlin – At 3:37 this morning (10:37 AM Shanghai time), the air raid alarm sounded loudly in Berlin, and residents awoke in alarm, rushing to air raid shelters and bunkers to hide. The alarm was lifted at 4:22 AM (11:22 AM Shanghai time). No sounds of Allied aircraft or German anti-aircraft fire were heard during this time. The weather was clear during the air raid alarm, but the entire city of Berlin was dark. (September 9th, Associated Press)

### Turkish Army Concentrated Awaiting Orders; Financial Issues Unresolved After the Establishment of the Anglo-Turkish Treaty

Paris – The French "Le Soir" received news from Ankara last night claiming that the Turkish army has been concentrated in Thrace near Istanbul. The newspaper claims that the Anglo-Turkish Mutual Assistance Treaty has been signed, but the financial issues remain unresolved. (September 9th, Associated Press)

### Skirmishes on the Western Front; French Troops Occupy Important Strongholds; Front Line Can Be Shortened by Ten Kilometers; Saarbrücken Under Siege

Paris – Reliable sources state that French troops, advancing under heavy artillery fire, surrounded Saarbrücken last night and should be able to enter the city today. Most of the German troops in the city, fearing their retreat would be cut off, have already withdrawn elsewhere. The isolated forces covering the retreat are now putting up a stubborn resistance so that the French army pays a heavy price before occupying the city. Saarbrücken is the industrial center of the Saar region, and with the retreat of the German army, its fall is only a matter of time. It is understood that French army units, after passing through the German fortifications in the forest area, have already reached the suburbs of Saarbrücken. The French authorities knew the weakness of the Siegfried Line, so they used 600 tanks to cover the entry of a large army into the Saar. According to French reports last night, German troops on the Western Front destroyed bridges and roads yesterday to prevent the French army from continuing to advance. According to the French Defense Authorities, the French army is still pushing forward regardless of landmines and destroyed bridges. It is reported that French engineering units are now building pontoon bridges under intense artillery fire to replace the destroyed bridges. The British troops are expected to arrive at the front line at the end of this week and fight alongside the French army. (September 9th, Associated Press)

Paris – The General Headquarters issued its eleventh war bulletin this morning, stating, "Our army's advance units made active advances last night and immediately occupied most of the Hundsrück Forest west of the Vaux district town. The area has been badly damaged and many traps have been found. In addition, our air force is actively coordinating operations with the army units." The French war bulletin indicates geographical locations so that readers can understand them at a glance. This is a first. (September 9th, Havas)

Paris – Semi-official sources commented on the General Headquarters' eleventh war bulletin, stating in brief that after French advance units occupied most of the Hundsrück Forest west of the Vaux district town, their front line was shortened by ten kilometers. This type of advance is different from a large-scale offensive and is one of the skirmishes. There are two objectives: (1) to occupy favorable strongholds, and (2) to test the strength of the enemy's forward positions. The French side used infantry and cavalry units in coordination, with a small number of tanks providing cover. The air force worked closely with the army units on the one hand and carried out large-scale reconnaissance of enemy positions, taking many valuable photographs on the other. (September 9th, Havas)

Paris – After the French army besieged the German industrial city of Saarbrücken, this morning, French and Moroccan troops advanced to within range of the German western fortress. The French Army Department issued a communiqué last night claiming that French troops had attacked the Saar Basin north of the German western fortresses. It is claimed that the German army retreated after destroying defensive fortifications and laying landmines. News from Luxembourg claims that the French vanguard has advanced halfway to Neunkirchen, 15 miles from Saarbrücken. The civilians of Saarbrücken were ordered to evacuate completely a few days ago, as the German authorities felt that they could not hold the city to prevent the French attack. The city was surrounded by French forces on both the east and west wings. One route of French troops went through German territory to Saarlouis, and another route went to Saarlautern. The first route of French troops attacked into German territory along the west bank of the Rhine River, and the second route of French troops advanced along the Moselle River Valley. According to neutral sources, the French army used 600 tanks to encircle the German army, and large bomber groups bombarded the German lines very fiercely during the advance. High-speed tank units destroyed the fortresses built by the German army on the slopes of the St. Nabor Hill, broke through German barbed wire, and enabled the French army to go straight to Saarbrücken. Most of the remaining German troops fled. Military circles here view the French attack on Germany as improving the French front line and eliminating the Saarbrücken salient (east of Metz, the main French military base), which protruded into French territory. The "Le Petit Parisien" newspaper today estimated that the French had advanced an average of four or five miles along a 25-mile-long front. Although French troops had advanced seven to ten miles in several places, no German western strongholds had yet been breached by the French army. When the German army retreated into permanent lines under intense French artillery fire, they detonated landmines to prevent the French army from advancing, causing several French tanks to be destroyed by landmines. (September 9th, Associated Press)

Paris – Heavy fighting is taking place in the Warndt Forest area on the right wing (on the banks of the Rhine River). News from Luxembourg claims that all border towns and villages have been ordered to evacuate. To date, the German army has avoided engaging the French army and is only using mobile units to prevent the French army from advancing. They indicate that they are concentrating all their efforts until the French army reaches the Western Defense Line, then they will attack. French military leaders claim that attacking the German strong Siegfried Line is out of the question. This undertaking, without prior preparation, will result in huge losses. Neutral military observers believe that the French army will continue to launch local attacks to test German strength and to straighten the border to ensure the safety of Metz. The French army will launch a large-scale attack on the Siegfried Line or conduct local attacks to find the German army's weaknesses, and will advance after the British army arrives at the front line. Most of the German army has withdrawn from Saarbrücken to avoid being surrounded by the French army. The French army hopes to occupy the industrial city of Saarbrücken today. The remaining German isolated forces will put up fierce resistance to the French army, demanding a heavy price. (September 9th, Associated Press)

Paris – The French "L'Intransigeant" reports that the residents of Saarbrücken, Germany, have now been completely evacuated, and other Saar cities are also being evacuated. All residents are now being moved to Koblenz and Cologne. The "Le Temps" newspaper commented on the Western Front, saying that the German army seems to prefer to allow the French army to make small advances rather than engage in battle. In the future, when more important battles occur, they will take the form of siege warfare, and the use of heavy weaponry will be necessary. (September 9th, Reuters)

Editorial

### School Youth

Regarding their own children, they show utmost care; regarding youth in general, they show utmost enthusiasm, concerning themselves with them, guiding them, and expecting much of them; both spring from innate nature.

Now is the time when schools start the autumn term, also the third academic year for Shanghai school youth, struggling in torment and bewilderment. Shanghai's turbulence has long affected schools; now the impact is even more profound, directly moving a portion of school youth. Our enthusiasm, however, advances together with the turbulence!

Turbulence and stability are entirely dominated by the macro environment, we cannot expect Shanghai schools to achieve stability before the larger Shanghai environment does; but we cannot help but loudly appeal, hoping that all parties, even if they cannot increase the welfare of schools and youth, should at least not subject schools and youth to unnecessary turbulence! Youth are the pillars of the future, school youth are merely garden seedlings: who does not cherish pillars? Who can bear to destroy seedlings! The youth of the past two years have suffered enough torment, now they are not only tormented, but even bewildered. They were originally only tormented by the macro environment: but as long as they understand the macro environment, they can grasp their own thoughts and actions; now even in the micro environment problems are occurring everywhere, youth not only feel that the environment is not easy to understand, but also feel that their own safety is questionable. Try to put yourself in their place and think, a shooting incident actually occurred in the school office, what kind of lesson is this, what kind of stimulation? Therefore, even if the youth are spiritually very developed and very honest and peaceful, in their actions they cannot help but be cautious everywhere. With pure thoughts and lively spirits, youth are caught in such a complex environment, it is easy to imagine how depressed and indignant they must be.

In an extremely turbulent environment, how can everyone cultivate themselves to be well-trained and firm in their judgment? In addition, some youth will inevitably be unable to withstand the pressure of the environment and go with the flow, and some youth will inevitably be unable to overcome the temptation of the environment and lose their way. Therefore, the current impact of turbulence not only affects the education sector itself, but also affects the youth who are the target of education, which must be said to be a very important issue.

Since the Chinese army withdrew from Shanghai, Shanghai's education administration system has temporarily retreated, but the government has never reduced its attention to Shanghai education. Recently, since turbulence has occurred in Shanghai's education sector, the education authorities will certainly not allow it to grow and die on its own, and must be planning some appropriate measures. Judging from the current needs, the so-called appropriate measures should be nothing more than the following two points: First, the education authorities should set up various convenient methods to encourage Shanghai youth to be absorbed in the interior, let them breathe free and fresh air, and at the same time increase the strength of the interior to meet the needs there. This method is originally the state that most Shanghai youth dream of, and if it can be actively carried out at this time, it will inevitably reduce much of the current youth's torment. Second, the education authorities should immediately investigate the incidents in Shanghai's education sector, so that the public has a clear standard. As a result of the investigation, the law must be enforced; for those with problems, either order the board of directors to reorganize the school, or even revoke the registration. In this way, on the one hand, order will be restored and all kinds of opportunism and other malpractices will be eliminated; on the other hand, students and the public will gain a deeper understanding, fundamentally making the atmosphere of Shanghai's education sector clear.

Shanghai is a commercial and industrial society, and parents of students often adopt a non-interventionist attitude towards their children's education; but in such turbulent circumstances, parents should pay special attention to their children's future, helping them choose schools and teachers. In the past, the criteria for choosing a school often focused on appearances, on material equipment, and the criteria for choosing a teacher often focused on academic qualifications and social reputation; now the focus of selection should be placed on the school's discipline and the teacher's character. Because in the current serious situation, if one is not careful and buries the youth in a dark environment, it is not only a problem for one person and one family, it is simply a loss to the nation and the country.

As for the youth themselves, in such special circumstances, they should have the following understandings: First, youth are the pillars of the nation and the country in the future. Although the youth currently staying in Shanghai cannot go to the interior, they will eventually be a powerful force in building the country in the future. They should strictly guard their posts, bury themselves in hard work, and no matter what the environment, they must always hold the spirit of upholding justice and not being crooked. In this way, not only will the purity of the youth themselves be maintained, but also, according to the principle of mutual growth of teaching and learning, the entire Shanghai education sector can be moved to jointly establish a fortress of the spirit. Second, no matter how chaotic and turbid the current newspapers reveal, they are ultimately a minority in the entire education sector. We cannot doubt the entire Shanghai education sector because of this. We can still find good places to study in Shanghai, and we must not lose heart in our studies and ruin our future because of this. Third, the measurement of schools, teachers, and classmates should not be based on personnel systems, nor should we lightly believe rumors, but use a calm attitude, meticulous methods, and detailed observation; do not be demanding of material equipment, but pay attention to spiritual inspiration. Anything that meets the current requirements of the nation and the country is a good environment, and with a good environment, we should strive to cherish it. Fourth, if an adverse environment is discovered, one should decide one's course of action according to one's ability and the circumstances at the time, at least try to leave immediately.

We do not want to see school youth as warriors and martyrs in all struggles. They should struggle after they have been cultivated into talents. Teachers and even all aspects of society should not regard school youth as soldiers, tools, commodities, or flag-wavers. The parents and brothers of the youth must not neglect the important task of choosing schools and teachers for their children, and sit idly by as their children are misled by demons!

### Soviet Union Conscripts Large Numbers of Reservists to Strengthen Western Border Defenses in Preparation for Any Unexpected Events

Moscow. Large numbers of reservists in this city were conscripted into the army yesterday and today. Most of them are said to be assigned to the western border, and a large number of them are assigned to the city of Vitebsk (not far from the Polish border). In addition, soldiers in various western locations whose service terms have expired have been ordered to remain in service until January 1940. According to observers, Soviet public opinion has only now understood that once Britain and France declare war, they will have no choice but to go all the way. After Germany occupies Poland and approaches the Soviet border, its intentions toward the Soviet Union may not be reliable. The Soviet government is therefore starting to prepare as a precautionary measure. (Havas News Agency, 8th)

Paris. The news from Moscow's semi-official French sources that the Soviet Union has conscripted a number of reservists has caused various speculations here. The reasons for the Soviet Union's move are still unknown. However, some sources claim that this step, as well as the fact that soldiers of a certain division in the western Soviet Union whose service terms have expired are still in the ranks, indicates that the Soviet Union is preparing to deal with any unexpected events. (Reuters, 9th)

Moscow. The Soviet Union has at least partially mobilized. Mechanized soldiers, such as reserve members who drive tanks, were ordered to register yesterday. Some drivers were immediately drafted into the army. Others, after completing their registration, returned to their civilian jobs as chauffeurs, doctors, and nurses, and were also registered. Once war breaks out, they will join the army. New recruits in and out of uniform are being transported by train to the Polish border. Restrictions on civilian ticket purchases have been tightened, resulting in even more travelers lining up to buy tickets. The government has requisitioned horses for army use. Crowds gathered at the train station to watch the troops leave for the Polish border. Order in the station area is maintained by cavalry. The government views mobilization as a preventive measure. Mobilization is carried out very calmly. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union undoubtedly intends to concentrate heavy troops on the western border, with the same intention as the previous stationing of large armies on the eastern border. (Associated Press, 9th)

### Soviet Union Restricts Export of Goods

Moscow. According to the official TASS news agency, the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic has authorized the People's Committee for Foreign Trade to restrict or prevent the export of goods in accordance with the actual situation in order to avoid losses, since certain European countries have restricted the import of goods by means of laws, decrees, cutting-hand procedures, judicial procedures, or currency control regulations. Goods that have already been shipped for export should also be stopped from unloading, and the export of goods before payment should be prohibited. (Associated Press, 9th)

### After Warsaw is Besieged, Italy Seeks Mediation Again, Italian Newspapers Say the War is Expected to End, Ciano Meets with the British Ambassador, Mussolini Receives Toshio Shiratori

Rome. The morning newspapers here believe that the German-Polish war may effectively end before the fall of Warsaw. Although two-thirds of Poland's unfallen territory remains after the fall of Warsaw, the essential area of Poland has fallen into German hands, and Germany will certainly not pay attention to the remaining two-thirds of the territory. At the same time, it is also doubtful whether the Polish army still has the strength to resist. News reports say that the fall of Warsaw not only gives Germany a major spiritual gain, but also allows Germany to acquire the most valuable and modernized part of Poland. It is also said that after the battles of the previous week, it is indeed doubtful whether the Polish army can stand its ground. (Associated Press, 9th)

Berlin. According to sources in the National Socialist Party, although Prime Minister Mussolini's previous peace efforts have repeatedly failed, the Prime Minister may attempt to resolve the European conflict through peaceful means again. This news is considered very meaningful here. The Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, has been visiting the German Foreign Ministry every day since the outbreak of the European war, leading to the impression that there must be diplomatic action between Germany and Italy. (Associated Press, 9th)

Rome. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini received Japanese Ambassador Toshio Shiratori yesterday afternoon for a long conversation on the international situation. Foreign Minister Ciano was also present at the meeting yesterday, as Shiratori is about to return to his country. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

Rome. According to sources here, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano received British Ambassador Sir Rowland yesterday afternoon. The content of the discussion is being kept secret by the authorities. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

Rome. The Japanese military and economic delegation left here yesterday morning for Florence after visiting Ciano on Thursday. The delegation will visit the shipyards in La Spezia and Guinea. (Associated Press, 9th)

Rome. Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori, who recently resigned, was received by Mussolini the other day, and Foreign Minister Ciano was also present. (Havas, 8th)

### German War Report: Berlin Celebrates Victory

Berlin. The German High Command issued a communiqué this afternoon, stating that the Polish troops on all lines continued to retreat. German mobile units had reached the Vistula River. On Friday afternoon, they entered the Polish capital from the southwest. The German troops advancing towards Lublin had occupied the towns of Zvul and Radom on the west bank of the Vistula River. Lodz could be occupied today. The province of Posen is also gradually falling into German hands. The German Air Force is very active, while the Polish Air Force is not very active. Two French planes in the western battlefield were shot down in German territory. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)

Berlin. At 7:15 last night, the Berlin radio station suspended its broadcasts and read a front-line dispatch to the audience, declaring that "Warsaw has fallen." After the announcement, the radio played the music "Germany Above All Else" and suspended for five minutes. The German High Command issued an official announcement stating that German mechanized units had broken through Polish defenses and entered Warsaw after a short war. Front-line dispatches reported that the Polish army only offered short resistance to the German troops advancing southeast of Warsaw. German troops used tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft to break through the Polish defenses and strafed the Polish troops with machine guns. German troops advanced eastward to the north of Warsaw and quickly surrounded Warsaw from the south, making the Polish position untenable. The military authorities of the National Socialist Party said that the entry of German troops into Warsaw eliminated the possibility of Poland resolutely resisting the German troops. German telegrams declared that German troops captured part of a Polish division, including three artillery teams, in the southeastern forest area of the Poles River. The German troops took advantage of the fall of Warsaw to expand to all parts of Poland. One German column in southern Poland headed east towards Lauff, with the aim of cutting off the Polish troops retreating to the Romanian border. The German troops are making rapid progress in Poland. Mechanized units and the air force jointly repelled the Polish counter-offensive. German troops surrounded the city of Posen and occupied several places in the province of Posen. Officials declared that the German troops along the Rhine area were not attacked on Thursday. The German High Command announced that German troops had occupied the city of Sandomierz (the center of the Polish arms industry) yesterday. German troops had reached the town of Gora Kalwaria on the Vistula River. (Associated Press, 9th)

### Germany Intensifies Suppression of Czech and Slovak Ethnic Groups, 6,000 Slovak Soldiers Flee into Hungarian Territory

Zurich, Switzerland. According to news from Germany, Heinrich Himmler, head of the German political police, is organizing an "internal discipline organization" to maintain morale in the rear. All activities that could "endanger the German nation's resistance" will be severely punished. In addition, the German government has taken various new measures against the people of Bohemia and Moravia to suppress them. The terror and threats faced by the Czechs will inevitably intensify as a result. At the same time, the German government has also demanded that the autonomous government of the Slovak state send any Slovak who insults the German army in word or deed to the German courts for punishment. However, the Slovaks will also be subject to German law from now on. (Havas, 8th)

Budapest. Six thousand Slovak soldiers deserted their posts yesterday, crossed the border, and entered Hungarian territory. They are being detained in the Ga area. Slovakia was occupied by Germany before Germany began its invasion of Poland. (Reuters, 9th)

### Thirty-Nine Korean Prisoners Join Volunteer Army; Chinese Authorities Invite Foreign Reporters to Observe; Number of Japanese Prisoners Now Reaches Two Thousand Three Hundred

Chongqing. Today, the Chinese military authorities here invited foreign journalists to observe the ceremony of thirty-nine Korean prisoners joining the Korean Volunteer Army at the front. These thirty-nine Korean prisoners were captured from the former line north of Shanxi. Thirty-one of them are men, and eight are women. Since arriving here, they have been placed in concentration camps here. In the past fifteen months, they have received political education from the Chinese side. Now, all of them are dressed in green new Chinese military uniforms, full of energy, and it is clear at a glance that they are good warriors. It is said that when these Korean women were captured by the Chinese side, their status was only as geishas in the army. Those present at the ceremony included Japanese prisoners of war here, the families of all Korean volunteers, representatives of Taiwanese people, the Anti-Betrayal West Association, and the Japanese anti-aggression writer Wataru Kajidi. During the ceremony, the official in charge of the ceremony read the farewell speech of He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, which roughly stated that today the enemy's military and human resources have been used by us and will fight a decisive battle with Japan. Finally, he encouraged the thirty-nine people to return to their country as soon as possible and establish an independent and free Korean government as soon as possible. These thirty-nine people then elected a representative to deliver a reply, roughly saying that our decision to join the volunteer army is purely for the purpose of liberating our country. We cannot express in words our gratitude for the officers' teachings in the military academy day and night. He also said that China's sacred war has completely shattered Japan's continental plan. We have been subjected to the exploitation of the Japanese in the past, so today, we will not consider success or failure in fulfilling the mission of the country, but will strive for the thorough realization of the goal. After the speech, the Korean comrades sang the war song of the First World War. When these Koreans shouted, "Down with Japanese imperialism," the Japanese present applauded loudly. According to officials, there are currently 2,300 Japanese prisoners of war, scattered in 24 concentration camps. They have all received the theory of liberating weak nations and anti-aggression. These prisoners of war are now extremely polite when they see Chinese people. They also have wall newspapers. (September 9th, Associated Press)

### Japanese Troops in Shizhuang, Rugao, Fail to Attack Loufangtou, Two Killed by Chinese Troops

Rugao Communication. Shizhuang, a southwestern strategic town in the county, has been garrisoned by Japanese troops since the fall of the city. They have built strong defenses in the suburbs and have repeatedly tried to open the Rugao-Xinpu Highway, but have failed. Recently, it was learned that Chinese troops have moved into Loufangtou (five miles north of Shizhuang), posing a threat to the Japanese troops. In order to take the initiative, the Japanese troops drove the puppet police as guides on the night of the 29th of last month, followed by more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, and attacked the Chinese troops in Loufangtou. Halfway, they encountered Chinese sentries, and the two sides fought. The large Chinese army heard the news and immediately launched an encirclement. Because the Chinese army was familiar with the terrain, after a long battle, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. Local residents were awakened from their dreams. In this battle, one Japanese soldier was killed and one was wounded. The Japanese army then forced five villagers to carry the dead and wounded back to Shizhuang. The wounded died from their injuries. The five villagers were then executed by the Japanese army to vent their anger. It was truly tragic.

### Chinese Troops Recover Dongkan, Officers and Soldiers Bravely Swim Across the River; More Than Thirty Japanese Troops Killed or Wounded

Xinghua Communication. Recently, the Japanese troops in Dongkan, Funing, were under constant attack by Chinese troops and felt threatened. Therefore, they previously declared a retreat, but in reality, they secretly increased their forces in an attempt to defend it. Because Dongkan is an important stronghold in the eastern part of Funing, the Japanese side will never give up easily. An elite unit of the Hu regiment of the Chinese army cooperated with the Funing Standing Army and launched a fierce attack on Dongkan at 12:00 midnight on the 1st of this month, catching the Japanese by surprise and surrounding them from all sides. Another daredevil team was selected to swim across the river, climb the embankment wall, and rush into the enclosure, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army, with bayonets clashing. The battle situation was intense. The Chinese army continued to concentrate artillery fire on the southwest gates and bombarded them fiercely. The Japanese troops trapped in the enclosure initially resisted stubbornly with their solid defensive works. However, as the Chinese army continued to pour in, the remaining Japanese troops, seeing that the situation was hopeless, broke through the east gate at 3:00 am on the 2nd and fled. In addition to sending a rapid unit to pursue, the Chinese army completely recovered Dongkan Town at 5:00 am on the 2nd. The remaining Japanese troops fled to Santao. In this battle, the Chinese army seized a large number of enemy weapons, which are currently being counted. Thirty Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and the Chinese army suffered only a few casualties, resulting in the successful recovery of Dongkan.

### President Roosevelt Announces Expansion of Regular Army Personnel; Intended to Maintain the American Peace Front; Also Plans to Convene a Special Session of Congress; Current Neutrality Law Applied to the Union of South Africa

Washington. After the Union of South Africa declared war on Germany, President Roosevelt issued a statement ordering the implementation of the current neutrality law in the Union, and said that a statement on the Dominion of Canada has also been drafted and will be issued as soon as the Canadian Parliament decides to declare war on Germany. At the same time, he also announced that a "national emergency" has been established and invoked the special powers conferred by the "National Emergency Act" to increase the regular army personnel from 179,000 to 227,000, the National Guard personnel from 190,000 to 235,000, the naval soldiers from 100,000 to 145,000, and the Marine Corps personnel from 18,000 to 25,000. In total, from 497,000 to 622,000. According to special privileges, the expenses required for all of this can be ordered to be paid without first being approved by Congress. In addition, it has been decided to add 150 staff to monitor foreign espionage activities and prevent various sabotage activities. At the same time, $500,000 has been allocated for the expenses of sending overseas Chinese in Europe back to their country. (8th, Havas)

Washington. US President Roosevelt declared yesterday that the country had entered a limited state of emergency and ordered the strengthening of the strength of the army, navy, and Federal Bureau of Investigation. Afterwards, the President again stated in the press briefing that the purpose of this move was to maintain the American peace front and not to put the country in a state of war. He also said that he was planning to convene a special session of Congress, and the theme of its discussion, within the possible range, would be limited to emergency war bills, such as the abolition of the arms embargo clause of the Neutrality Law. As for the date of the special session, it has not yet been decided. When the President reported to reporters yesterday, his attitude was unusually cautious, and he emphasized that the limited state of emergency should not become a cause for alarm, because in fact, its scope is quite limited. He also said that the government's power is quite broad, but at present, there is no need to fully invoke it. As for this decision, it was announced based on various privileges. Afterwards, the President issued a declaration expressing his intention to apply the Neutrality Law to the Union of South Africa, because the Union has already declared war on Germany. According to the President, the United States will also declare neutrality to the Canadian government, and the draft declaration has been completed. It will be issued as soon as Canada's state of war with Germany is clearly determined. Regarding the strengthening of military strength, the US Navy will "as soon as possible" increase the total number of soldiers to 145,000 by means of recruitment. According to the President, he has not filled the military force according to the limit, because in principle, the naval personnel can be increased to 191,000. It is heard that the US Army personnel will be increased to 227,000, the National Guard will be increased to 235,000, and the Marine Corps personnel will be increased by 25%. As for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it will hire 150 more agents to assist the Department of Justice in preventing espionage activities and sabotage incidents. According to the President, the purpose of strengthening the army is to "fill the gaps in military strongholds" so as to have sufficient strength to defend Panama and the Plata naval ports. Once the naval personnel are increased, each battery will have sufficient gunners. One hundred and sixteen destroyers from the European War era (21 years ago) will be re-enlisted in the fleet this week, and the newly recruited naval personnel can also join the old ships for service (but only enough to make up for one-third of the vacancies). In addition, the President announced at the press briefing that the government has allocated 500,000 US dollars to assist American citizens in leaving Europe. (September 9th, Associated Press)

Washington. People close to the Exchange Rate Council recently declared that a majority of members of the House of Representatives and Senate support President Roosevelt. Once Congress holds a temporary meeting, the arms embargo clause in the current Neutrality Law is expected to be revised. However, because the President's broadcast speech on the 3rd of this month was well received by the people of the whole country, it is feared that after Congress convenes, the discussions will be complicated and protracted, and the national consensus will be diminished. It is better to wait for the entire public opinion to mature and for the members of Congress to fully understand the various inconveniences of the current Neutrality Law before convening Congress to discuss the revision issue. Therefore, the date of the convocation is still unknown. (August 8th, Havas)

Washington. President Roosevelt went to Hyde Park yesterday for a weekend vacation. (September 9th, Associated Press)

Washington. In order to implement American neutrality, the US Navy will concentrate its fleet in the Pacific Ocean to strengthen defense work. The Navy Department plans to fly twin-engine bombers to Manila to join the aircraft carrier "Langley" for service. The "Langley" is leaving Honolulu for the Philippines, and there are no aircraft on board. A Navy spokesman said that the number of submarines in the Asian Fleet will be increased to 13. Although there are six submarines in Manila now, they are too old. The Navy Department will replace them with new-style boats, but it is not prepared to immediately withdraw these old boats. The submarines of the United States in the Eastern Ocean are all used to maintain American neutrality and defend against foreign warships invading Manila and other ports. (September 9th, Associated Press)

Washington. US Federal Inspector-General Murphy, after meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday, told reporters that he believed that the current law prohibiting profiteering from war could not produce "real effect." For the Department of Justice, we intend to request Congress to convene a special meeting to stabilize prices and obtain greater protection. Murphy declined to answer. President Roosevelt spoke to reporters afterwards, saying that he did not see the possibility of convening a special session of Congress for this matter. The President had previously assured the people that the situation regarding prices in 1917 and 1918 would definitely not recur. Although prices are increasing, they will not increase dramatically without limit. The United States will definitely not have a shortage of food. There is currently a surplus of food in various places. Experts say that the soaring price of sugar is unreasonable. The government may revise import tax rates to obtain a large supply from the Philippines and Cuba. (September 9th, Associated Press)

Washington. The British Ambassador here declared yesterday that the British government has requested the United States to continue to step up the manufacture of aircraft under the current British contract. 75% of the aircraft specified in the contract have been completed.

### Canada May Have to Temporarily Postpone Declaration of War Compulsory Military Service Not Yet Implemented

Ottawa. Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King recently declared in the House of Commons that the government has no intention of implementing compulsory military service. What Canada should cooperate with the United Kingdom is (1) jointly defending Newfoundland Island on the Atlantic coast, (2) supplying the United Kingdom with various goods, and (3) providing financial assistance to the United Kingdom. In the near future, what other tasks Canada should undertake for the European war besides the above three matters must be determined after holding meetings with various allied countries and discussing them in detail. But we advocate sending pilots to Europe to assist in everything at least. The military delegation sent by the British government has arrived here to prepare to order various military supplies from Canadian factories and to study the possibility of increasing the quantity of ammunition manufacturing. "In short, if the United Kingdom and France are defeated by Germany, the countries in Northern Europe that consider themselves neutral will change their names. In other words, if Germany wins, there will be no neutrality or isolation for any country in the world." (August 8th, Havas News Agency)

Ottawa. Prime Minister Mackenzie King recently delivered a speech here, roughly saying that the Canadian government may have to temporarily postpone formally declaring war on Germany due to various factual reasons, and wait for the US Congress to hold a temporary meeting to discuss the abolition of the arms embargo clause before making a decision. At this time, it is willing to supply the United Kingdom and France with large quantities of food and raw materials, and manufacture ammunition on behalf of all factories.

### UK Assures Respect for Thailand's Neutrality

London. The Ministry of Information recently issued a bulletin stating, "A few weeks ago, the Thai government (i.e., Thailand) expressed anxiety, fearing that its neutral status would be undermined by belligerent countries. This anxiety was obviously caused by foreign countries. The British government instructed its minister to Thailand to provide assurances to the host government, declaring that if the neutral status of the country is respected by other countries for one day, the British government will respect it for one day. This guarantee is the same as the guarantee previously given by the United Kingdom to Switzerland and other neutral countries. It is hoped that the Thai government's doubts about the attitude of the British government can be dispelled from now on. (September 9th, Havas)

### Britain Imposes Economic Blockade on Germany: Preventing Contraband from Entering German Territory; All Countries' Merchant Ships Must Be Inspected

London: Since Britain declared war on Germany, the King has issued an order to exercise, to the fullest extent possible, the rights enjoyed by belligerent nations to prevent merchants from privately smuggling war supplies to the enemy. All ships, regardless of nationality, passing through the Strait of Gibraltar, the Suez Canal, and the English Channel, may be intercepted and questioned by British warships and ordered to proceed to designated ports for inspection. If any ship refuses inspection, whether on the high seas or in designated ports, it will be subject to punishment by the "Prize Court." According to a public statement issued by the Information Department, the British government has decided to use the ports of Kirkwall, Weymouth, Gibraltar, and Haifa in Palestine as inspection points for ships. Contraband items are divided into two categories: the first category is absolutely prohibited, including military equipment, ammunition, cotton, kerosene, and various other items; the second category is relatively prohibited, including food and various other goods, as follows:

First Category: (1) All kinds of military equipment, ammunition, explosives, chemical warfare agents, and all kinds of machinery used to manufacture or repair them; all kinds of raw materials used to manufacture these items; all kinds of items that require the use of these raw materials; (2) All kinds of fuels and materials used for land, sea, and air transportation; all kinds of machinery used to manufacture or repair land, sea, and air transport vehicles; all kinds of raw materials used to manufacture these transport vehicles; all kinds of items that require the use of these raw materials; (3) All kinds of tools, materials, drawings, paper, machinery, and documents that can be used for war purposes; all kinds of items used to manufacture or that require the use of these war supplies; (4) All kinds of currency, all kinds of metals used to mint currency, all kinds of machinery, models, copper plates, and other materials used for minting.

Second Category: All kinds of food, provisions, fodder, clothing, and all kinds of raw materials used to manufacture clothing and food supplies. (Havas, 8th)

London: The Information Department recently issued a public statement, stating that the government has established ship inspection stations in the ports of Kirkwall, Weymouth, Gibraltar, and Haifa in Palestine. All ships sailing to enemy territory or to neutral countries' ports easily accessible to the enemy are expected to voluntarily proceed to one of the four listed ports for inspection, with Weymouth being the most preferable. If, after inspection, it is proven that no contraband is being transported, a pass will be issued. If any ship does not wish to voluntarily proceed for inspection, British warships, if they deem a thorough inspection impossible at sea, will order it to proceed to one of the four listed ports for inspection. The list of items prohibited from being transported to the enemy has already been published. To prevent these items from reaching the enemy, the British government has decided to exercise all the rights of a belligerent nation, but at the same time, it will endeavor to facilitate legitimate commerce for neutral nations and has notified neutral governments that any suggestions they may have will be considered at any time. In essence, the economic warfare conducted based on the rights enjoyed by belligerent nations at sea is often referred to as a blockade, but this decision does not formally declare a blockade against Germany. Henceforth, any merchant ship carrying contraband, whether the items are directly transported to the enemy or transported to the enemy via another country, will not be allowed to continue sailing. However, the inspection stations will strive to expedite all procedures for neutral countries' merchant ships, especially those voluntarily proceeding for inspection. Furthermore, all merchant ships of various countries sailing to British ports along their usual routes must also submit a detailed report of their cargo. If there is suspicion of carrying contraband, the Ministry of Economic Warfare may order them to unload the cargo and gather all kinds of evidence for submission to a special committee for review. At that time, the cargo may be released, or it may be detained for further investigation, or it may be directly seized. If there is no need to detain the ship, it will be released. If the cargo or ship is detained, the case must be transferred to the Admiralty for submission to the Prize Court for adjudication. (Havas, 8th)

London: After the government decided to inspect ships of various countries and issued a list of prohibited items, diplomatic circles here have stated that this is a novel way of blockading the enemy. The government is taking this measure to exercise the various rights of a belligerent nation and to use all possible methods to prevent the items listed on the list from being transported to Germany. Recalling the outbreak of the European War, the list issued by the British government divided various goods into three categories: the first category included absolutely prohibited contraband, the second category included relatively prohibited contraband, and the third category included goods permitted to circulate. This time, only the first and second categories are listed on the list. If necessary in the future, other types of goods can be added to the first or second category at any time. It is generally believed that the most important measure this time is that, regardless of the reaction of American cotton merchants, cotton is directly included in the first category. It is believed that Americans will fully understand the reasons why Britain had to do this. Therefore, the British government resolutely issued and implemented it. In the future, if the British government finds that neutral ships are carrying prohibited goods to Germany, it will definitely inspect them without any doubt. It is heard that after the British government conducted negotiations with various countries through diplomatic channels, it is now possible to use all possible methods to inspect the ships of various countries.

### British and French Navies Cooperate to Protect Sea Traffic; German Submarine Activities Make Navigation Dangerous; Merchant Ships Sunk Now Number Thirteen

Paris: According to a statement from the Permanent Secretariat of National Defense, the French naval and air forces are working closely with the British fleet to protect the merchant ships of both countries. (Associated Press, 9th)

New York: In the past five days, as many as thirteen merchant ships have been sunk by submarines. The merchant ship "Jingertrude" sent a signal last night, notifying the maritime radio station that it had rescued fourteen crew members of the British ship "Lechintaig." The location and details have not been obtained. News from Newcastle, England, stated that the Henderson Shipping Company received a short telegram from the captain of the company's "Bogistan," stating "Sunk, all safe." The ship was sunk by a submarine in the Atlantic Ocean. The Henderson Company received reports from other sources that the Dutch ship "Port Jack" had rescued thirty-five crew members of the "Bogistan." The Dutch-American Shipping Company's "Statendam" had rescued thirty-seven crew members of the "Winkler." The Italian ship "Gaste Bianco" arrived in Lisbon last night, carrying twenty-three rescued passengers from the British ship "Manane." The victims of the submarine bombing tragedy have reached one hundred and forty-eight. (Associated Press, 9th)

London: The British merchant ship "Winkler," with a tonnage of 5,000 tons, sailing from London to the United States, is now feared to have been sunk by a German submarine. A brief radio message received here from the Dutch ship "Stetendam" stated that the Dutch ship had rescued all the crew members of the "Winkler," but did not mention the fate of the "Winkler." It is largely believed to have been sunk. The British ship "Manae," which was bombed by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean yesterday, was discovered last night by the Italian ship "Bianco Palace." One of its lifeboats, carrying twenty-three people, was immediately rescued. However, the whereabouts of another lifeboat carrying seventeen people are still unknown. Currently, a Portuguese destroyer and several military aircraft are searching at sea. (Reuters, 9th)

London: The Information Department recently issued a public statement, stating that Germany is using submarines to attack British and French merchant ships wantonly. It is evident that submarine commanders have been ordered to sink British and French merchant ships upon sight, without issuing a warning. The severity of the situation is no less than in 1917. Such actions are in direct conflict with the regulations on submarine warfare. Germany unconditionally accepted these regulations when it entered into a naval agreement with Britain in 1935, and they should still be valid today. Moreover, these regulations cannot be disregarded on the pretext of any actions by other countries. Now, Germany has brazenly violated them. It is heard that several German submarines were ordered to sail to various commercial sea lanes a few days before the outbreak of the war. This proves Chamberlain's statement that although a fair solution to the dispute between Germany and Poland was possible, Hitler was unwilling to do so. Since Germany implemented submarine warfare, Britain has suffered considerable losses. The sinking of the "Athenia" is the most notable of these. Our navy has taken strong measures to respond. However, it is advisable not to publish news of enemy submarine sinkings. There are two reasons for this: (1) The quiet disappearance of submarine crew members has a greater psychological impact on the enemy than publishing news of sinkings. This has been proven in the previous European War. (2) If the enemy knows that a submarine performing a mission in a certain area has been sunk, it can send another submarine to replace it. In addition, the method by which German submarines attack high ships should not be published so that the German naval authorities do not know that the submarines have used up their torpedoes and have to return to their home country. In short, since the enemy brazenly prepared for submarine warfare before the outbreak of the war, it was inevitable that our merchant ships would suffer initial losses. Once the escort system is fully implemented and the supply of German submarines is cut off, the impact of submarine warfare will quickly diminish. (Havas, 8th)

### German Forces Lay Mines in the Oresund Strait

Zurich, Switzerland: A dispatch from the correspondent of the "News" in the Swedish capital states that after Germany laid mines in the Oresund Strait, three ships have sunk as a result in recent days. It is extremely dangerous for ships of various countries to navigate these waters. The strait has both a northern and a southern entrance, with the southern entrance being wider and the northern entrance being very narrow. Germany has not only laid mines in the southern entrance but has also filled the northern entrance with explosives. Fishing boats from Denmark, Sweden, and Norway have had to stop fishing. In addition, several British warships are patrolling along the Atlantic coast of Norway, inspecting ships of various countries. The German ship "Freiburg," which was preparing to sail to Java, has changed to the Danish flag and changed its name to "Eblro" to avoid inspection by British warships and has arrived at the port of Trondheim in Sweden. However, another German ship, "Molke Bub," has been sunk by a British warship in Norwegian waters. It is heard that several other ships, carrying a batch of iron ore, were sailing from Norway to Germany. One of them has been detained by a British warship en route, while the remaining ships have sailed to neutral ports for temporary shelter. It is generally believed that two-thirds of Norway's annual iron ore production is sold to Germany. Now that the British Navy has implemented inspections, this export trade is bound to be disrupted, which will have a significant impact on Germany's raw material supply. At the same time, the Norwegian Iron Ore Company, seeing that the sales of ore are hindered, was forced to lay off 1,500 workers yesterday. (Havas, 8th)

### Two German and Dutch Ships Sink After Mistakenly Hitting Mines

Stockholm, Sweden: The German ship "Bismarck" struck a mine laid by its own country in the Oresund Strait this morning and sank immediately. Only half of the fourteen crew members were rescued. The Oresund Strait is located between Sweden and Denmark. (Havas, 8th)

The Hague, Netherlands: After the government laid mines along the coast, one of its own mine-sweeping ships struck a mine in the North Sea today and exploded immediately, sinking to the bottom of the sea in one minute. Twenty-nine crew members were killed, while the remaining twenty-two were rescued by government aircraft and nearby ships. (Havas)

### German Ship Bremen Still Missing

New York: The German government announced yesterday that the "Bremen" had safely entered a "neutral port," making the whereabouts of this German giant ship feel extremely "mysterious." According to previous reports from British and French sources, the "Bremen" had been captured by the British Navy and is now docked in a British port. News from Reykjavik, Iceland, stated that five German ships (totaling 22,000 tons) had taken refuge here in the past few days, but the "Bremen" was not among them. It is widely believed that the "Bremen" may have taken refuge somewhere in Iceland. (Associated Press, 9th)

### British King's Younger Brother Takes on Important Wartime Post; Governor of Australia Temporarily Unchanged; Duke of Windsor Returns Home

London: Government circles announced today that the Duke of Kent, the younger brother of the King of England, who was originally scheduled to go to Australia this autumn to replace Lord Gowrie as Governor-General of Australia, has now taken on an important naval post during wartime. Therefore, the position of Governor-General of Australia will temporarily remain unchanged, with Lord Gowrie continuing to serve. It is reported that the Duke of Gloucester, the third brother of the Duke of Kent, has also taken on an important wartime post as Liaison Officer for the battlefield forces. (Reuters, 9th)

Manila: The Italian mail ship Biancamano Conte, which sailed to Hong Kong yesterday, carried 440 German nationals, of which 400 were German Jews. They did not disembark when they passed Singapore.

### Bai Chongxi Arrives in Shaoguan from Guilin to Participate in the Inauguration Ceremony of the Party and Government Committee of the Fourth War Zone

Shantou Correspondence: Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Headquarters, flew back to Guilin from Chongqing on August 29th and flew again to Shaoguan, Northern Guangdong, on the 31st to oversee military and political planning. At 10:00 AM on September 1st, the members of the Party and Government Branch of the Fourth War Zone held their inauguration ceremony in Qujiang. Bai personally supervised and delivered a speech. Only Xia Wei was absent on that day. All other military and political leaders from various places were present. At 2:00 PM, the members held their first meeting and elected the director of the general affairs section. They then returned to their respective fronts to command the military. Zhang Fakui went to Huiyang for inspection. Su Zhaozheng and Xiang Hanping accompanied Zhang to inspect the positions in Boluo, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and Danshui. Wu Qiwu returned to Jieyang and Hepo. Luo Yiqun, Director of the Southern Guangdong Branch of the Provincial Government, accompanied Deng to set up an office. Bai gave a long speech at the Party and Government Branch on the 1st. Excerpts of the main points are as follows: Bai stated that the Japanese are coercing and forcing our strong men in the occupied areas to form puppet troops to act as their vanguard and sacrifice their lives. The military purpose is to "use barbarians to control barbarians," and the political purpose is to "use Chinese to control Chinese." The Japanese are also printing counterfeit currency in various places, plundering materials, seizing navigation rights and customs, and monopolizing industry and commerce, absorbing national currency and obtaining foreign exchange. The economic purpose is to implement "using war to support war." In the two years of Japanese aggression against China, more than 2.6 million strong men have been killed or injured. They are now using three-quarters of their home country's military force in various parts of China. Based on the enemy situation reported by various war zones in the past six months, it can be judged that the Japanese have exhausted their strength and have no major reinforcements to send. Each operation is exhausting them. Since the various war zones have entered a stalemate, the Japanese have no possibility of further advance. The longer this stalemate continues, the more beneficial it will be for us. However, in order to achieve victory, we must coordinate with favorable international situations and launch a timely general counterattack. We must also mobilize the entire people to resist and coordinate politics, economy, and military affairs to achieve final victory and stand in an invincible position. We must earnestly promote national public opinion in the various guerrilla zones, attack the Japanese on one hand, and cut off transportation in the occupied areas on the other hand, creating an economic counter-blockade. We must earnestly promote national public opinion and persistently consume the enemy, causing their economy to collapse and making it impossible to support war expenses. This is the way to certain victory.

Starting on September 1st, the new Chinese Air Force has appeared over Guangzhou and Chaoshan, assisting the advancing army. At 7:00 AM on the 1st, twenty-one Chinese planes appeared over Guangzhou, dropping sixteen bombs on the Tianhe airfield. Many planes and military supplies parked on the airfield were destroyed. The loud explosions shook the entire city. On the 2nd, more than ten Chinese air force planes flew to Chaoan, dropping bombs on various Japanese strongholds on Hulu Mountain, Zhugao Mountain, and Bijia Mountain outside the city. The Japanese defensive works were completely destroyed. It is also heard that a major bloody battle will soon break out in the Chaoshan area.

### Guangning in Guangdong Province During the War of Resistance: People's Livelihood Suffering Due to Transportation Blockade, But the Discovery of Gold Sand in Various Places Provides Assistance

Zhaoqing Correspondence: Guangning County in Guangdong Province, located in the remote western part of the upper reaches of the Northwest Two Rivers, is situated west of Shui and north of Zhaoqing, adjacent to the Xiayi County of Guangxi. It is surrounded by overlapping mountains and towering bamboos and trees, forming a natural barrier. The Sui River, originating from the Guangxi border, flows through the county, downstream to Sihui, converging with the North River, meandering to the Sanshui River estuary. The county is small and the land is secluded, with simple and honest customs. Since the Xinhai Revolution, Guangdong has frequently experienced political upheavals, but Guangning has never suffered from the ravages of war, earning it the reputation of a paradise. However, after the Japanese army invaded Guangdong, their vanguard extended to Sanshui in the West River. The border between Sanshui and Sihui has become a battlefield for the two armies. Because of its proximity to Guangning, Guangning suddenly became a military center. ××××××××××××××× and others have all been moved here. In addition, refugees from counties downstream of the West River flocked here, and this small, remote area has transformed into a bustling metropolis. Guangning was originally a barren land. The county's grain production is only sufficient to supply half a year's worth of food. The people rely on bamboo and wood products to supplement their livelihoods. Those who visit the area only see towering mountains, verdant forests, and dense bamboo groves, obscuring the sky and the sun. During times of peace, bamboo and wooden utensils produced in the county, such as baskets, brooms, and dippers, were transported along the Sui River to Sanshui, Southwest, Foshan, or Guangzhou for sale. Guangdong people refer to them as North River fir and North River bamboo, which are mostly unique products of Guangning. It is estimated that the annual value of bamboo and wood products is as high as four to five million yuan. The county's people rely on this major production to maintain their livelihoods, and although the land is barren, they can still make a living. However, when the West River was blockaded by the Japanese army and the inland roads were completely destroyed, transportation was disrupted, and the transportation of bamboo and wood products was cut off. The county's livelihood suddenly became impoverished and desperate. In addition, prices soared, and unemployment was widespread, making livelihoods even more difficult. According to a survey conducted by a certain charitable organization, the total population of Guangning County is about 250,000. Before the war, ordinary farmers could afford two meals of vegetables and white rice every day. Since the West River waterway was blockaded, only 10% of the households can afford meat dishes with their meals. 20% have rice but lack meat dishes. 40% have only one meal of porridge or rice per day. The remaining 30% live by drinking porridge or simply eating potatoes and taro to stave off hunger. The hardship of their lives is unimaginable.

Fortunately, since the beginning of spring, gold sand has been discovered along the Sui River. A fisherman's wife was washing clothes on the bank of Jiangtun Village when she accidentally saw shimmering light on the beach. The fisherman's wife picked up gravel and panned it with water, obtaining several coins' worth of gold sand. Once this news spread, nearby villagers brought baskets and dippers and rushed to the riverbank to pan for sand. Soon, gold sand was also discovered in the four suburbs of the county seat and in the areas of Gushui Township and Shangpang Township. As a result, for several months, the trend of panning for gold sand has been extremely popular. Laborers, poor villagers, men, women, old and young, formed teams and groups, mobilizing their entire families. Some formed groups of three to five people, others groups of hundreds of people. Every day, tens of thousands of people went out to work, panning in the river or digging in the valleys. The area for digging gold has been expanding, and there have been cases of damaging transportation and harming property owners' fields, residences, and graves. It is said that, on average, each person can pan for gold sand worth 20 to 50 cents per day, which is enough to maintain one day's food. Amidst this war of resistance, people's lives are extremely strained. Fortunately, this treasure has been discovered in the county, providing assistance to the poor masses, which is indeed a fortunate event amidst misfortune. County Magistrate Chen Xiangnan, fearing that the people's gold digging would damage transportation and infringe on property rights, but in order to maintain the people's livelihood, he could not prohibit it in fact. Therefore, he formulated seven temporary measures for gold digging and announced them to the public to abide by, so that both sides could benefit. As for the fields with property rights, if gold sand is found, the owners should use bamboo and wooden fences to protect them from damage. Alternatively, the property owner can hire workers to explore and dig, with one party receiving 70% and the other receiving 40%. For the past few months, the people of Guangning have been able to barely support their livelihoods, all thanks to this.

Last year, an American geologist went to the West River to investigate mineral resources and actually conducted a survey in Guangning. According to him, Guangning's strata are widely distributed with gold sand, but the mineral deposits are not thick, making it unsuitable for large-scale mining. It is only suitable for small-group mining by laborers. It has also been found that gold sand is exposed in Suiqing, Luoding, Kaijian in the West River, and even Cangwu and Jihuai counties in Guangxi, but it is not as widely distributed as in Guangning. Also, because Guangning does not have a gold sand purchasing agency, the villagers mostly collect the gold sand they have obtained and send people to Wuzhou to exchange it. This is because the Wuzhou market has a public price for buying gold sand, and the Guangxi Bank also sets a fixed price for its collection.

### Occupied Counties: Puppet Regime Forcibly Levying Land Tax, Drafting Measures for Forcible Collection

Suzhou Correspondence: The only evil deed of the puppet organizations in the occupied areas is the collection of land tax. However, the countryside is controlled by guerrillas, and there are also mobile county government organizations, resulting in very little land tax being collected by the puppet regime last year. Now, the autumn harvest is approaching, and the puppet organizations are forcing the puppet magistrates to quickly determine the collection methods, such as merging rent and tax, levying tax based on rent, or having tenants pay grain to offset rent, or using puppet police to concentrate on one area first and forcibly collect it, in order to implement their cunning schemes of forcible collection.

### Lido Comes From Behind, Defeats St. Francis Yesterday, Charity Football Match Results in 4-3, St. Team Leads 2-1 in First Half

This year's football season kicked off yesterday. Lido and St. Francis played a charity match at the Yi Garden. There were over 3,000 spectators. Lido scored first, then lost two goals. The first half ended with a narrow defeat of 1-2. After the change of sides, Lido's momentum increased, creating a 3-2 lead. St. Team scored again to tie 3-3. Lido finally broke through St. Team with a 4-3 victory. Xu Wenkui scored all four goals and can be regarded as the number one contributor. After the match, Li Ruzhang, an executive of the Relief for Refugee Children Education Institute, auctioned off the match ball. As a result, Qiu Zifeng, a rice merchant tycoon, bought it for 200 yuan.

Xu Wenkui Scores Four Goals

Yesterday, both sides' footwork was a bit rusty. Lido's lineup was stronger than St. Team's. Center Li Yichen was injured not long ago and left the field due to a foot injury. He was replaced by Jiang Chao. Jiang's movements were sluggish and he missed opportunities frequently. Otherwise, Lido would not have had to expend so much effort to win. This was the main reason for creating a tense situation. Xu Wenkui was blessed with inspiration and scored four goals, earning him high praise from the entire field. Sun Tieleg worked hard to connect the lines, but his luck was not good and he failed to score. Yun Feng was weaker in the first half. Wang Kehou entered the field not long ago and immediately filled in as center. His movements were excessive and he often went offside. St. Francis still maintained its consistent style, using long passes and central breakthrough tactics. Fu En first served as right wing, then was transferred to right forward, but he was not successful. The best central defender was the Jewish strongman, Tou Temen.

One Goal Behind, Three Ties

Lido attacked first and was unstoppable. Xu Wenkui received a pass from Li Yichen and swept it into the goal, opening the scoring. Only five minutes had passed since the start of the match. Two minutes later, Aidehua of the opponent team hooked the ball from the baseline, and Mai Xianle shot it into the left corner from the ten-yard area, making it 1-1. St. Team launched another fierce attack. After ten minutes, Ka Luoliequ shot forcefully from six or seven yards away, and Lido was unable to save it, falling behind 1-2. After fifteen minutes, Li Yichen left the field due to a foot injury and was replaced by Jiang Chao, greatly affecting the momentum. The first half ended with St. Team leading 2-1, turning defeat into victory. When the second half started, after five minutes, Xu Erz fouled Jiang Chao at the twenty-yard area and was penalized with a free kick. Sun Jinshun kicked it lightly to Wenkui, and Xu scored with one kick, making it 2-2. Lido's momentum soared. Jiang Chao and Wang Kehou switched positions. Wang filled in as center, and the offensive became fierce. After one minute, Zhang Mingsheng broke through Ge Linbao and Qie Hute in succession and passed to Xu Wenkui. Xu did not move. Xu Erz rushed over and kicked the ball into the net, but it was another point. Aidehua passed the ball in, and Ka Luoliequ stabbed it into the crowd, tying the score again at 3-3. After nine minutes of stalemate, Wenkui received a wonderful pass from Mingsheng, tricked Kai Botuo, and forcefully kicked it into the goal. Lido then won with a score of 4-3.

When the HSBC rates were announced, there were no changes. Likewise, there were no changes when the Silver Equalization Tax was announced. Subsequently, Western merchant Sassoon suddenly began selling, and Hong Kong Electric and Chinese merchants followed suit, causing the market to firm slightly. Sassoon and Hong Kong Electric successively sold spot Sterling to HSBC and other foreign banks at 3/8ths of a shilling and 9.0625 pence, and 9.6875 pence respectively.

### Foreign Exchange Rises

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw only a half-day session for both foreign exchange and gold markets. Initially, due to the weakness of these two markets, US dollar notes gradually fell to 14.78 yuan. In the afternoon, the unofficial gold price surged to 3,956 yuan, which boosted confidence and buying interest. The price quoted by the Zhigonghui rose to 15.2 yuan, up 0.25 yuan from the previous day. Sterling notes also rose 0.05 yuan, Hong Kong notes by a large 0.05 yuan, and Japanese notes continued their upward trend, rising to 1.33 yuan in the evening, an increase of 0.058 yuan. Korean notes rose slightly less, up 0.025 yuan to 1.13 yuan. Other currencies remained stable.

### Weekend Afternoon Closing: Cash in the Unofficial Market Suddenly Surges, Trading at 160-170 Yuan Higher Than the Official Market

Yesterday, the unofficial market for cash continued to decline, as the foreign exchange market appeared increasingly stable and the Hong Kong authorities removed restrictions on gold trading. Consequently, speculators, aware of poor actual demand, did not dare to hoard excessively, leading to a very weak market that would be difficult to revitalize in the short term. However, the market was relatively stable at the opening, starting at a high of 3,850 yuan. Subsequently, due to frequent selling by pawnshops and more outflows than inflows from money changers, coupled with a weakening foreign exchange market, buying interest was weak. Although securities firms and certain gold companies still showed some interest, ample funds led to a sharp drop to a low of 3,730 yuan. Later, as selling eased and securities firms resumed buying, the price rose again to 3,805 yuan. At noon, profit-taking by long positions caused it to fall again to close at 3,785 yuan, down 70 yuan from the previous day. There was no official market in the afternoon, but the market seemed to stabilize slightly, reportedly rising back to 3,956 yuan. Trading was active for the half-day session, with about 1,000 taels changing hands. Gold jewelry shops eventually quoted 10 yuan higher, while customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Profit-Takers Sell Cash Gold

Starting in the morning, prices were stable. A certain gold company bought 10 taels from a certain bank at 3,840 yuan, 5 yuan lower than the previous close. After the opening, pawnshops frequently sold gold, with few buyers, causing prices to gradually decline. Soon after, the price was reduced by 10 yuan, with pawnshops selling 30 taels to gold companies at 3,810 yuan. Rumors of foreign firmness prompted money changers and cash gold companies to start selling. Although securities firms and certain gold companies showed some interest, funds remained too abundant, causing prices to continue to fall. Before long, the price fell another 80 yuan, with money changers trading 10 taels at 3,730 yuan, the lowest price of the day. Later, sellers decreased, and securities firms and gold companies showed renewed buying interest, causing the price to rise by 70 yuan. A certain money changer sold a total of 30 taels to securities firms and fellow traders at 3,800 yuan. At this time, a certain gold company suddenly took profits, briefly pushing the price down to 3,790 yuan. As retail buying interest remained strong, the price rose again to 3,805 yuan. Approaching noon, securities firms also took profits, and pawnshops continued to sell, causing the price to retreat into the 3,800 yuan range. A certain bank sold 20 taels to money changers at 3,785 yuan, the closing price for yesterday afternoon, down 70 yuan from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 120 yuan for the half-day session. The selling price of cash gold from cash gold companies was 10 yuan higher than the official price. The current standard gold price was 55 yuan lower than the quoted gold price, with few transactions.

Jewelry Gold High at 400 Yuan

The initial exchange rate for gold jewelry per tael was 390 yuan at major shops. By 9:30, the price was raised by 10 yuan. At 11:15, the price rose back by 5 yuan. At noon, the price was lowered again by 5 yuan. At 2:50 pm, the price rose by 5 yuan again. At the closing, the price rose by 15 yuan, resulting in a total increase of 10 yuan, with major shops quoting 400 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang quoting 398 yuan, roughly a reduction of 20 yuan in commission.

Customs Pure Gold Remains Unchanged

London, September 8th (Telegraph) - The price of British pure gold remains at 8 pounds and 8 shillings per ounce, so the Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash remains fixed at 1,370 yuan and 0.9 yuan. The quoted customs gold price also remains at 2.707 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also remains at 1,366.2 yuan.

### Indian Silver Surges, Sterling and US Dollar Stable

London, September 8th (Telegraph) - Silver market speculators were active, buying and selling at times, but the market was generally stable, closing unchanged. Some holders made up for their short positions at prices lower than the quoted price. Both near-term and far-term silver futures were unchanged. New York silver cables: Spot US dollars were also unchanged. Bombay silver cables: The Indian silver market was firm, with spot prices rising sharply by 3 rupees and 14 annas, and futures rising sharply by 3 rupees and 8 annas compared to the last day before the market closed.

### Discount Rate Falls and Then Rises

Yesterday's discount rate on bills of exchange initially fell, and money supply then turned tight. In the morning, the initial rate was as high as 140 yuan per thousand yuan, then fell to a low of 130 yuan. At noon, it rose slightly to 135 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to rise to 140 yuan, 2.5 yuan higher than the previous day. The Shanghai Money Trade Association's overnight rate remained unchanged, opening at 0.2 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Remain Firm, Far East Stocks Fall, Foreign Bonds Remain Untraded

Yesterday's securities market trend was relatively strong. Lots of Category B bonds were drawn, so the market price was stable in the morning, except for Sin Chuen bonds. In the afternoon, due to rumors of borrowing, the market price rose again. Yesterday's trading was mostly short covering. The opening price in the morning was higher, but profit-taking by long positions caused a small decline. In the afternoon, the price rose again due to rumors of borrowing, but failed to stabilize. The price difference between Category B and Category C bonds, after drawing, was only a few cents. The resulting market price was slightly better, up 0.1 to 0.4 yuan. Category B was slightly down by 0.3 yuan. Category D bonds were not traded. The total number of transactions was about 670,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

In stock trading, 200 shares of Xianjiao Hantai Pinggu were traded at 2.325 yuan.

The Chamber of Commerce reported that yesterday's market was calm and firm, with rubber stocks performing well, but trading was not active. The International Rubber Regulation Committee recently announced that the quota for the last quarter of this year will be increased from 60% to 70% to meet the needs of the US barter agreement. This will increase rubber production by 11,000 tons, and the exchanges required by this agreement are 8,000 tons. The exceptional increase will last for six months to meet the needs. Rubber planting companies will benefit from increased production and dispersed costs, which will prevent costs from being as high as before. The quota for the year was only 45%, so the final benefits for small producers are obvious after this change.

London Telegraph: No Chinese foreign bonds were traded on the London Stock Exchange today. However, there was continued trading in British Far East company stocks. Macaulay Bank shares fell 7 shillings and 6 pence to 6 pounds, 2 shillings and 6 pence. HSBC shares fell 10 pounds to 70 pounds. Gula Ke Lin Pong rubber was still at the original price of 17 shillings and 6 pence. No other reports.

### Yarn and Cotton: Raw Cotton Soars, Yarn Market Gradually Tightens

The yarn market is generally stable and becoming increasingly tight. Merchants from South China and Hong Kong continue to purchase yarn. There is a great demand for 20-count yarn. Jin Yin brand 21-count yarn is selling well. There is slightly less demand for 10-count coarse yarn, with 490 bales being purchased. There is also demand from the mainland, and sentiment is optimistic. In addition, raw cotton is firm, and traders' willingness to buy is increasing. However, the unit price of Shuangma brand 20-count yarn is still low, because of the 3,000 bales previously offered, the factory required that silver be paid in full by 4:00 pm today, otherwise the offer would be invalid. For those who could not turn around their funds, they had to sell at the market price, which eased the situation slightly. However, some people took the opportunity to buy cheap goods, so the market rose again at the close.

The spot yarn market opened calmly in the morning. As it was the end of the week, brokers shouted prices slightly higher. The opening price for Shuangma brand 20-count yarn was 634 yuan, a decrease of 3 yuan. However, the selling price of spot goods was not loose. Soon after, a certain company suddenly bought yarn, and the price rose immediately, reaching 642 yuan. The spot price of Shuangma brand yarn was 695 to 700 yuan. 20-count Wufu brand yarn sold even better. News of a decline in gold prices caused a slight dip, but the market rose sharply again at the close. A total of 1,650 bales were traded in the half-day session. The prices of Shuangma brand 20-count yarn rose by 9 yuan, Shouyang and Wufu brands rose by 15 yuan, Shuangqiu brand rose by 9 yuan, and Tiannu brand rose by 5 yuan. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:

### Shanghai Inventory Depleted, Cotton Prices Rise Daily, US Cotton Fell Yesterday

The trade in Chinese and foreign cotton is still very active. Factories are in need of cotton. However, the inventory in the market is gradually depleted, because since the outbreak of the European war, foreign cotton shipped to Shanghai has incurred increased war risk insurance and other fees. In addition, foreign exchange rates have tightened recently, leading to higher purchasing prices. Traders are scrambling for the cheap inventory in everyone's hands, creating a situation of near exhaustion. Therefore, the market price is rising steadily. Indian cotton Bailuo rose another 5 yuan, new Tongzhou cotton rose another 6.5 yuan, and Brazilian cotton rose sharply by 7 yuan. As for new cotton, although it is currently being harvested, the supply is unreliable due to the current environment. More than 600 bales of Subei and Tongzhou cotton have arrived, half of which are new and half of which are old. The record of spot cotton sales is listed below:

Hong Kong 490 Bales Fellow Traders 930 Bales

Mainland 205 Bales Ningbo 25 Bales

Total 1,650 Bales

### Shanghai Inventory Depleted, Cotton Prices Rise Daily, US Cotton Fell Yesterday

The trade in Chinese and foreign cotton is still very active. Factories are all in need of cotton. However, the inventory in the market is gradually depleted, because since the outbreak of the European war, foreign cotton shipped to Shanghai has incurred increased war risk insurance and other fees. In addition, foreign exchange rates have tightened recently, leading to higher purchasing prices. Traders are scrambling for the cheap inventory in everyone's hands, creating a situation of near exhaustion. Therefore, the market price is rising steadily. Indian cotton Bailuo rose another 5 yuan, new Tongzhou cotton rose another 6.5 yuan, and Brazilian cotton rose sharply by 7 yuan. As for new cotton, although it is currently being harvested, the supply is unreliable due to the current environment. More than 600 bales of Subei and Tongzhou cotton have arrived, half of which are new and half of which are old. The record of spot cotton sales is listed below:

Cotton traders have been unwilling to disclose information recently due to business reasons. In fact, goods are exhausted. Traders are lamenting that there is no business to be done. As for the bustling new cotton market, the supply is blocked and cannot be cleared. Therefore, most of the major cotton companies in this port have changed their strategy and are focusing on trading American and Indian cotton to breathe. According to a certain source, Shanghai cabled overseas yesterday to buy a huge amount, causing a very large increase or decrease in the market price of US cotton. The highest price for October new cotton was 0.101 yuan. The estimate of a 968,000-bale increase in yields caused the price to fall back by 0.77 pounds, and then close. Cotton merchants are mostly keeping the state of spot cotton a secret, but the general situation is still clear.

Another report stated that trading in foreign cotton in this port has been very active recently. Everyone is deeply concerned that it will be difficult to ship foreign cotton to China, and overseas cotton markets have soared, so everyone is competing to buy it, resulting in unusually high sales values. Brazilian cotton that can be spun into 32-count yarn is being sold for over 200 yuan. 42-count yarn is being sold for over 370 yuan, even Tongzhou cotton is priced at around 160 yuan.

New York cotton market prices were relatively stable in the morning due to fellow traders buying. However, the market price suddenly rose by more than 40 points due to fierce buying by speculators. Later, most people took profits, and the market suddenly weakened. As a result, closing prices fell by 7.8 to 16 points compared to the previous day. The Liverpool cotton market is also under government control. The market price will not change. The Indian cotton market was open yesterday, but there was no business. It is predicted to fall by 3 rupees today. Egyptian cotton rose by more than 20 points.

### US Cotton Production: Government Second Estimate Report

Washington (September 8th Telegraph) - The US cotton crop's second yield estimate has been released by the Department of Agriculture's Estimating Bureau, with the estimated yield at 1,238 million bales, an increase of 968,000 bales from the previous year. The latest five-year trend is listed below:

### Grains: Buyers Active, Flour Expensive - Wheat Prices Also Rise by 0.2 Yuan

Flour: Yesterday's spot flour prices increased by another 0.2 yuan to 6.9 yuan. This is limited to wholesale prices on this street. Various factories have already shipped no less than 200,000 bags of flour after North China traders were active. There are restrictions on sales to customers. It is said that Hong Kong traders have handled more than 100,000 bags at a price of 7 yuan. There are no other wholesale transactions. Goods returning to the market are even more in demand. Those who hold goods are unwilling to sell late. This environment is all due to the outbreak of the European war. Foreign wheat has been banned from being exported, so people are even more eager to hoard. Total transactions for the market, including local and customer purchases, are about 50,000 bags.

Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market also tended to be firmer. Since the outbreak of the European war, foreign wheat prices have risen daily. There are concerns that the source of supply will be interrupted. In addition, flour prices have risen sharply, attracting attention from traders inside and outside the industry. Domestic wheat is even more popular with hoarders. Flour mills and Japanese factories continue to purchase. Yesterday, traders bought more than 10 train cars of Suzhou and Zhenjiang wheat, and Zhada flour mills bought more than 5,000 bags of wheat from Guan Dian, Yangzhou, and Xiongshan. Prices were up about 0.2 yuan.

### Zhuangqiao New Rice on the Market, More Goods Arriving, Opening Prices Continue to Ease

Du Geng: Yesterday, no new shipments from Hexia arrived. More than 3,000 bags of new goods from various places arrived in Shanghai by wheelbarrow. The volume of wholesale purchases was low, mostly just small replenishments by shops. However, the new rice from various places that arrived earlier was particularly abundant, resulting in a supply exceeding demand. Buyers had to cut prices again to boost sales. As a result, although the prices of new and old rice continued to fall by more than 1 yuan, there was still a lack of purchase volume. The price of West Xin rice was still the firmest, so there were no gains or losses at the close. New Zhuangqiao rice was on the market yesterday, only about 50 dan, with a price of 32.5 yuan. Special Xijing rice was still 40 yuan, high-quality rice was 38 yuan, and Su Tong Kun rice was 37.5 yuan and 37 yuan. Early Hexia rice was quoted at 34 yuan in the early market and 33.5 yuan later. Original bag fresh goods were 37 yuan. The older rice was 26.5 to 36 yuan. Jiangbei new rice was 27 yuan and 26.5 yuan. Old Wu rice was 27 yuan. Chen Pai rice was 25.5 yuan and 25 yuan. New rice was 27 yuan and 26.5 yuan. Jiashan Jiaxing new rice was 27 yuan to 26.5 yuan. New Yangtuan rice was 17.5 yuan to 27 yuan. Total transactions were 4,000 to 5,000 bags.

Ke Xian: Yesterday, new rice from various locations arrived in a steady stream. 4,000 bags of new and old rice from Jiangjing, Wuwei, and other locations continued to arrive. In addition, new rice from the mainland also flowed into Shanghai. There is also the pending implementation of the Yangmi Pingyi (Yang rice leveling) scheme, and follow-up negotiations are still ongoing. The market is inevitably going down. Most holders are willing to sell as soon as the goods arrive, and the stock stored by traders is mostly returning to the total. The market is thus moving in the opposite direction to the粳rice market. As a result, high-quality rice was slightly lower by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan, medium-quality rice was slightly lower by 0.6 or 0.8 yuan, and Jiangbei low-quality rice was only 22.5 yuan. Wuwei auctions were 24 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Rises Sharply, Shanghai Factories Active in Foreign Sales, Prices Rise Thousands of Yuan in One Week

Foreign silk markets rose sharply yesterday. New York spot prices rose 0.11 to 0.17 yuan. Near-term and far-term standard silk rose 0.15 yuan. Yokohama spot prices were 1,600 yuan, up 150 yuan. Far-term prices rose 178 yuan. It is reported that since the outbreak of the European war, most of the world's artificial silk factories have been converted to military industries. Therefore, the use of real silk is bound to expand in the future. However, trade and transportation are inconvenient after the war, and insurance is expensive. Therefore, speculative trading on the New York Stock Exchange has become very active. That is why silk prices have soared unprecedentedly.

Shanghai's silk market is very active in foreign sales. B-grade Bai silk was traded at 4,250 yuan yesterday, up thousands of yuan in one week. Jili silk was traded at 1,860 yuan. It is estimated that Dachang and Heyi have purchased silk. A total of 300 loads were transacted.

### Coal: Hongji White Coal, No Goods Traded in the Market

Hongji white coal, because of the European war, production is blocked and no new goods have arrived. In addition, during the off-season, inventory is weak, and supply is not meeting demand. Sales have been stopped in the market. The price suddenly surged sharply, and each ton is being quoted for 120 yuan. Small pieces are very scarce, and the price exceeds lump coal. Second-grade small pieces are 80 yuan per ton, but the quality is poor, the fire is weak and prone to explosions. It is said that the stock is not large, and the goods are very popular.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Continues to Rise

Yesterday's sugar market, according to a Dutch telegram, bulk white sugar for immediate shipment rose to 6.28 guilders. Hong Kong telegram: Taikoo lump white sugar B-grade is required to be 16.5 Hong Kong dollars. Therefore, the trend of the Shanghai Association's price quotation is even higher. The initial increase for 24 clean white sugar was 3 yuan, followed by an increase of 2 yuan, for a total increase of 5 yuan. This shop was 57 yuan to 59 yuan, other shops were 55.5 yuan to 58.8 yuan, and transshipment goods were 47 yuan. Taikoo lump white sugar rose 5.2 yuan, initially to 59 yuan to 60 yuan, and then to 64 yuan. Remaining goods were sold according to returns. The initial price for H-mark granulated sugar was 41.6 yuan, later rising to 46 yuan, a total increase of 5.5 yuan. Dutch granulated sugar rose by 1 yuan. Spot goods were 45 yuan to 47.3 yuan, and transshipment goods were 40 yuan. The increase in domestic绵白 sugar was similar. Zhenji No. 1 was 59 yuan, No. 2 was 58.5 yuan, No. 3 was 58 yuan, and No. 4 was 57.5 yuan. Domestic No. 1 ice sugar was 65.5 yuan, and Jingming ice sugar was 67 yuan. Domestic sugar prices also tightened. Huizhou rose by 4.5 yuan, with more than 200 bags being traded at 61.5 yuan. Beihai Yang was 50 yuan, more than 100 bags, and the Chaozhou gang was heard to be at 39.5 yuan, and the Min gang was at 40 yuan, a total of more than 100 bags.

### The Shanghai International Settlement Has International Characteristics and Will Not Undergo Political Changes; The Japanese Have No Intention of Taking Over the Settlement; The United States Has Huge Interests and Will Not Ignore It; Former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Fessenden, Issues Statement

The Continental Daily reports that Fessenden, the former chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council for thirty years, met with reporters yesterday (the 8th). According to his statement, if the nationals of the belligerent countries in Shanghai can exercise some self-restraint in their personal feelings, it will greatly benefit Shanghai in safely navigating the current European war. The reporter asked if he believed that the Japanese would use coercive measures to take over the Public Settlement in the current tense situation.

The Japanese Will Not Take Over the Settlement

Fessenden firmly stated that he anticipates no political changes in the foreign-administered area. He added that any country interfering in the administration of the Public Settlement would not achieve any practical benefit. Based on his current observations, he believes that the Japanese have no intention, now or in the future, of taking over the Public Settlement.

The United States Will Not Stand Idly By

The administrative mechanism of international co-management is a complex entity. Any attempt to overthrow the old regime would throw the city into chaos and inevitably lead to destruction. Changes must be implemented gradually. Furthermore, the United States has substantial commercial interests in the Public Settlement. Any attempt by the Japanese to interfere with the existing administrative mechanism would be met with strong opposition from the United States, which would strain relations between the United States and Japan.

Commercial Prospects Will Not Be Greatly Affected

Fessenden commented on the impact of the new European war on Shanghai's commercial prospects, stating that the city would not suffer significant losses. Except for the disappearance of German ships at sea, with Italy remaining neutral, sea routes to Europe and the United States remain open. Despite the war, goods continue to travel between many European and American ports and Shanghai. The peace and tranquility of Shanghai itself depend on the self-restraint of the nationals of the belligerent countries in Shanghai. These expatriates must remember that the Public Settlement is an international area and, for the benefit of the entire citizenry, must abandon personal feelings.

Various Countries Avoid Getting Involved in the Vortex

Fessenden further recalled that during World War I, the German expatriates in Shanghai suffered considerable losses. Their property in the concession was confiscated, and their interests in the Public Settlement were severely affected by the implementation of British trade-with-the-enemy laws. When asked about his views on the future of the war, Fessenden said that he did not believe that all Germans were blindly following "Hitler and his group." He had many friends who were German. Currently, all countries are exercising self-restraint to avoid being drawn into the war. Whether we can remain permanently uninvolved remains to be seen.

Two More Predictions for the Future

Regarding the United States, Fessenden believes that it will stay out of the war. However, if certain events occur, such as (1) repeated and brutal attacks on American ships that impede freedom of the seas, or (2) if the United States sees Hitler gaining power in Europe and democratic countries in real danger, then the United States may not stand by. However, he believes that these events are unlikely to occur and that Germany's poverty and hardship will lead to a revolution faster than during World War I. Since leaving his position at the Municipal Council, Fessenden has resumed his law practice in the city. Six months ago, he suffered from an eye ailment, which significantly affected his work, but he is now recovering.

Shanghai Refugees Cannot Enlist

The Shanghai Evening Post reports that Shanghai received a telegram from London yesterday (the 8th) afternoon announcing that foreign refugees in the United Kingdom can enlist in the British Army and receive the same treatment as British volunteers. The general public has expressed great concern. Many German and Austrian Jewish refugees, as well as Czechs, in Shanghai feel that they may have the opportunity to enlist in the British Army and go to the European front. However, they were immediately disappointed, as inquiries with the British authorities in Shanghai revealed that while the British authorities may find it convenient to recruit foreign refugees in their own country to serve under the British flag, doing so in Shanghai is not very convenient.

British Nationals Registered Are Not Mobilized Either

According to a source at the British Consulate, British nationals in Shanghai who have already signed up for voluntary service are not currently being mobilized to Europe. Even if some British nationals specifically request to go to the European front, they are told that if they wish to go to Europe, they must pay their own way. As for refugees from various European countries who express a desire to serve under the British flag, it is difficult to transport them to Europe, and there are many young men in Europe who can be immediately trained and put into service, so it is not appropriate to spend resources transporting refugees there.

British Defense Force Not Organized

The British Consulate official also stated that he was not aware of any plans to organize a Shanghai British Defense Force, but pointed out that the British authorities have advised British nationals in Shanghai to join the local business association.

The Identity of German and Austrian Refugees

Furthermore, the question of the German-Austrian Times, which has been in doubt for the past week, remains unanswered. When reporters asked the British Consulate whether the British in Shanghai regard these unfortunate immigrants as neutrals, enemies, or comrades, they were told that the consulate could not decide, but that the matter had been reported to London and is awaiting instructions. These German and Austrian Jews were expelled from Germany and Austria by Hitler's regime. If London decides to recognize them as enemies, these unfortunate people will suffer even more. Shanghai is currently awaiting instructions from London.

American Cruiser Moves to the Huangpu River

Since the outbreak of the European war, warships of various countries stationed in Shanghai have successively sailed away under orders. Those that remain are mostly gunboats with smaller tonnages, so the Huangpu River has become desolate. It has been learned that the American cruiser Marblehead, which had been moored at the Asia Wharf in Wusongkou, sailed into the Huangpu River yesterday morning and is now moored off the Bund at Wuma Road. The ship is currently the largest foreign warship in the Huangpu River.

German Merchants Can Withdraw Deposits as Usual

According to reliable sources in the Shanghai financial community, after Britain declared war on Germany, the British government subsequently imposed an economic embargo on Germany, so British banks in Shanghai refused to pay out deposits and bills of exchange belonging to German nationals. Because the Shanghai Public Settlement is a neutral zone with international characteristics, British banks, such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, were ordered to suspend the aforementioned decision as of yesterday. All deposits and bills of exchange belonging to German nationals, whether commercial or personal, can be withdrawn from British banks as usual and will no longer be subject to the restrictions imposed on Monday of this week. German goods stored in British wharves or warehouses can also be retrieved as usual.

### The Jisfei'er Road Refugee Shelter Was Invaded by Japanese Puppet Vehicles, Occupying the Building and Setting Up Machine Guns. British Troops Rushed to the Scene but Withdrew

Since the outbreak of the European war, the Japanese government has separately proposed to Tokyo and Shanghai that belligerent countries avoid unfortunate incidents in China. In fact, since there have never been German troops stationed in the Shanghai Settlement, there is no possibility of unfortunate incidents occurring. Moreover, the Settlement is neutral in nature.

Its status was determined during the last European war. The dissemination of the Japanese opinion is understood to mean many things, both Chinese and foreign. Just like Mr. Fessenden does not believe that the Japanese would take over the Shanghai International Settlement. Recently, the outside world rumored that the Japanese side attempted to manage the Shanghai West Extra Boundary Road Area. All discerning people did not believe in that rumor. It was in the afternoon that some puppet police searched and invaded the Shanghai West Extra Boundary Road Area.

According to subsequent investigation, the sole reason the Japanese puppet forces moved into the 31st Jisfei'er Road Refugee Shelter of the Cilian Association. The situation at the time was not as intense as reported outside. According to the reporter of Dazhong Agency who went to Jisfei'er Road in Shanghai West at 9 o'clock last night for on-site investigation

It was learned that at 10 a.m. yesterday, two Japanese officers, accompanied by a translator, went to inspect the 31st Shelter of the Cilian Association, No. 11 Jisfei'er Road. All the rooms upstairs and downstairs were inspected and mapped before leaving half an hour later. At 4 p.m., 240 Japanese soldiers, accompanied by about 20 puppet police officers, arrived at the shelter in several trucks. The office of the staff on the first floor and the two large rooms of the refugee dormitory were occupied by Japanese troops and puppet police officers respectively. Sandbags were immediately placed at the gate and machine guns were set up. In a part of the place, the refugee shelter and Yutong Middle School were surrounded by wire mesh. Japanese soldiers prohibited people from entering and leaving through the main gate, and a gate was temporarily opened on the bamboo fence on the north end of Jisfei'er Road for people to enter and leave. At that time, the Japanese soldiers did not behave violently.

Until about 7 p.m., a British truck with 30 people drove to the scene, erected a machine gun on the sidewalk opposite the shelter, and the two sides confronted each other for dozens of minutes before the British army was ordered to retreat, and the situation eased. Six Japanese soldiers were still stationed in sandbags in front of the shelter gate, and six puppet police officers were stationed on both sides, all holding guns in a posture of attack. Fortunately, nothing happened.

### Chinese Sailors on German Ships Docked in Japan Were Dismissed; Italian Ships Operated Solely in Eurasian Freight; Japan Plans to Buy the Scharnhorst; The Idea of the Suez Canal Mail Route

The German Norddeutscher Lloyd's Scharnhorst and the three ships of the American Zeist Trading Company, the Abel and the Cormoran, have now taken refuge in Japanese ports, not daring to continue their voyage to avoid being searched by the British Navy. All the Chinese sailors on the three ships, such as sailors and stokers, totaling more than 130 people, have been temporarily dismissed by order of the head office during the war. The Chinese sailors returned to China from Kobe on the American mail ship Coolidge. The ship will arrive in Shanghai at 2 p.m. on the 12th of this month and berth at the Gonghexing Wharf. After returning to Shanghai, the Chinese sailors will have to wait until the German ships resume their voyages before they can return to work. It is said that there are a total of six German ships left in Japan, two of which are the new ship Scharnhorst of the Norddeutscher Lloyd and the cargo ship Nan Bei Tou. Yesterday, an unofficial source said that Japan plans to buy the new ship Scharnhorst of Norddeutscher Lloyd for 15 million yen, and negotiations are underway. The regular mail ships of the Eurasian Shipping Company have temporarily suspended their voyages to the Far East due to the impact of the European war. The shipping schedules of the Lan Ying Rou ships have also not been determined. Therefore, the Italian mail ship Qiu Li Qi Chai, which has been stranded in Shanghai for a long time, is solely operating the Eurasian freight route. It was originally scheduled to return to Europe this morning, but due to the extraordinary congestion of freight, the loading and other procedures were delayed. It will set sail as soon as the loading is completed. Regarding the passengers who have purchased tickets, the company said yesterday that in addition to sending a separate letter to inform them, the date of departure must also be announced in the newspaper after it is determined. As far as the Shanghai-Europe mail delivery is concerned, the Shanghai Post Office's joint mail department still seals and sends packages through the Siberia, Pacific, and Suez Canal routes without any difficulties. However, many senders of mail to Europe have recently specified that their mail be delivered via the Pacific route. Judging from the above situation, senders seem to have doubts about the safety of the Suez Canal mail route. There has been no significant reduction in the number of European mail items sent from the Post Office since the outbreak of the European war. Moreover, many senders of European mail have been specifying that the same mail be sent via the Siberia, Suez Canal, or Pacific route. Therefore, it is speculated that the number of Shanghai-Europe mail items will not decrease. In the past, Shanghai sealed and sent as many as three to four hundred bags of European mail per month, with a weight of several hundred kilograms. Due to exchange rate differences, the Post Office has moderately increased fees since September 1. Although the European war has expanded, the Post Office has no plans to increase European mail fees again. As for the Shanghai-Europe mail transport ship schedule and the sealing and delivery dates and times, the Post Office prints a daily mail transport gazette for advance notice. The gazette can be subscribed to from the Post Office. However, the ship schedules in the gazette are subject to change from time to time.

### Zhou Shen Lane Encountered Fierce Battle; One Guerrilla Died for His Country

The Songjiang Reserve of the 8th Detachment of the Zhongyi National Salvation Army recently received a secret order from the superiors to cross the Pei Dong and advance to the Longhua, Caohejing and other places to prepare for an attack on the Japanese garrison. At about 1 p.m. yesterday afternoon, a detachment leader Jiang Genxian led more than 20 members of the team, on the side of the avenue in Zhou Shen Lane, west of Zhongshan Road (about two li north of Caohejing Town), encountered a large group of Japanese soldiers (about 50 or 60 soldiers divided into land and water). A fierce battle broke out, lasting about an hour. The guerrillas charged fiercely with hand grenades, and the Japanese army retreated after being overwhelmed. One member of the team died on the spot. Afterwards, the nearby puppet police heard the news and rushed to surround and search various residences, but found nothing. Currently, the Japanese side has a strict security situation in the area, and residents are searched when they enter and leave.

### Japanese Residents Determined to Protest Electric Company's Increased Electricity Fees

The North China Daily News reports that the Japanese Residents' Road Federation held an executive committee meeting at the Japanese Wooden Association on Thursday afternoon and resolved to prepare a protest letter, which the president of the Federation will personally deliver to Mr. Fessenden, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, to oppose the Shanghai Electric Company's increased electricity fees. If the Municipal Council does not take action on the fee increase, the Japanese resident users may organize a "No Electricity Fee Alliance."

### The Bloodshed at Zhi Mei Lou; The Origins of Wang Zhongyuan; Former Inspector of the French Police; Dismissed Three Years Ago and Once Assassinated; Lawyer Liu Liang Safe and Sound

A shooting occurred at the Zhi Mei Lou restaurant on Simalu Road the night before last, and Wang Zhongyuan and Liu Yong were killed on the spot. The following are the latest details obtained yesterday:

The Life Experiences of the Two Deceased

According to investigation, the deceased Wang Zhongyuan, also known as Wang Zhongkui, was from Hebei. He previously served in the French Concession Police Department as a Chinese inspector in the political section. Three years ago, he was dismissed from the French Concession Police Department for widely distributing invitation cards. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Wang was active again. He was assassinated last winter at the intersection of Jingan Temple Road and Hardoon Road by a man named Zhu Xingliang, but the attempt failed. Half a year later, Wang still could not avoid his death. The other deceased, Liu, also known as Liu Liang, was also from the north.

Lawyer Liu Liang Safe and Sound

Lawyer Liu Liang has served in Shanghai for many years and is known in society for handling cases fairly. In addition to his business, he is modest and does not get involved in foreign affairs. The night before last, he went to a relative's wedding feast and returned home late. The Liu Yong who was assassinated in the Zhi Mei Lou bloodshed was also known as Liu Liang, and their names differed by only one character. At the time, there were rumors circulating. Reporters from this newspaper went to Lawyer Liu's office to inquire, but the new staff in the office were not sure of Mr. Liu's whereabouts. Now it is known that Mr. Liu is safe and sound. This is to reassure those who are concerned about Mr. Liu and to express our apologies.

### The Two Settlements Will Begin Security Measures Today; Because the "September 18th" Anniversary is Approaching; Security Measures Will Be Taken as Usual to Maintain Law and Order

The authorities of the two settlements in Shanghai, in order to ensure the safety of the settlements as the eighth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident approaches, and at this time of tense situation, have decided to start taking security measures from this morning. Special measures will be taken in the week before and after the anniversary. The details are as follows:

Special Martial Law Will Begin Today

The police authorities of the Public Settlement and the French Concession are doing their best to maintain law and order within the settlements. Emergency security measures were taken on the "July 7th" and "August 13th" anniversaries this year, and they were able to pass peacefully. As the eighth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident approaches, in this autumn of the outbreak of the European war and tense situation, more close attention is being paid to the security of Shanghai. In order to ensure public safety, it has been decided to start special security measures early today. All police personnel in the police stations will be dispatched to patrol and search pedestrians.

Emergency Measures Before and After the Anniversary

According to reporters from the Daguang News Agency who inquired with relevant parties, the police authorities are also aware of the continuous assassinations in the settlements in recent days. Therefore, in addition to starting security measures early this morning, emergency measures will be taken in the week before and after the "September 18th" anniversary. All unnecessary roads and alleys at the intersections will be blocked. The garrisons of various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will still assist in the defense. The security situation will be more tense and stricter than on "August 13th" in order to curb chaos and maintain law and order.

### Business Firms Suggest Reusing Half-Cent Copper Coins; Letter to the Citizens' Federation; To Be Submitted to the Authorities for Consideration

Fuhe Tobacco Company and other business firms wrote to the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District yesterday, saying that since the disappearance of cent coins from the market, the lack of small change in stores has become a very serious problem in the business community today. The issuance of cent coin notes by the Central Bank has been hindered, but the social need is urgent. When the central government unified the currency system, it issued two types of copper coins, one-cent and half-cent. One-cent coins are in great demand and circulate quickly. Although half-cent coins are also commonly used in the market, they are not popular with citizens. It is thought that the number issued must also be limited. At present, the urgent measure is to submit a request to the Central Bank to issue the existing half-cent copper coins as one-cent coins. If there is a shortage, please ask the central government to manufacture them quickly. In this way, because the half-cent coins have less copper content, there will be no profit for unscrupulous people to buy them. Moreover, they are issued by the government. Please forward this to the authorities for consideration. However, since the value of store coupons has gradually been lost after the store coupons gradually lost credibility in the market, except for the coupons of streetcars, buses, and the four major companies, which are still accepted in the market as usual, postage stamps have also gradually resumed circulation. Therefore, the lack of substitutes for cent coins can be temporarily overcome.

### After the Establishment of the General Office by the Four Banks; Financial Institutions Are Strengthened; Legal Tender Reserve Increased; Public Inspection and Announcement

In order to consolidate finance and improve wartime financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance, with the approval of the National Defense Supreme Committee, has established a joint general office jointly organized by the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China to be responsible for various businesses related to the government's wartime financial policy, and to stabilize foreign exchange with all efforts. The details are as follows:

Public Inspection and Absorption of Floating Capital

In order to consolidate the foundation of legal tender, short-term commercial bills, warehouse receipts for goods, and investments in production enterprises are added to the legal tender reserve. The management committee for the issuance reserve is improved, and representatives from chambers of commerce and money industry associations in major provinces and cities are invited to participate. A public inspection is conducted once a month, and the amount of issuance and the actual situation of the reserve are announced to show great faith. At the same time, floating capital in society is absorbed and the financial network is expanded, such as promoting savings and investing savings in production enterprises. Banks are established everywhere to invigorate local finance. In addition, efforts are made to stabilize foreign exchange and supply legitimate needs as much as possible.

General Offices of the Four Banks Are Located in Chongqing

Reporters from the New Voice News Agency learned from the banking community yesterday that the general offices of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China were located in Shanghai before August 13th.

However, a part of them are located in Hong Kong for the convenience of handling affairs. In the future, they will concentrate on the general office in Chongqing, and branches will be established in various places in Shanghai. After the four banks jointly formed the general office, all matters decided by the Ministry of Finance will be expressly ordered to the general office for compliance, so that there will be no separation between the four banks in terms of handling affairs. It is reported that the general office will set up inspectors who will take turns going to the general branches and branches of the four banks to examine whether the banks have violated or delayed the government's policies.

### Location and Date of Price-Controlled Rice Sales: Three Locations Selected in the International Settlement, Sales Expected to Begin Gradually Next Week

Price-Controlled Rice Sales Held by the Commercial Press for Its Employees

After Yu Qiaqing and other leaders of various organizations ordered 18,000 bags of Saigon rice, which arrived in Shanghai and were completely unloaded by yesterday, and stacked in the warehouses of the Sino-Italian Company and Fuxin Factory, it was decided to entrust the Rice Trade Association to handle the price-controlled sales. A reporter from the New Voice Society interviewed Zhang Nianxuan, chairman of the Rice Trade Association, yesterday. According to him, after consultation with Yu Qiaqing, a total of five locations will be set up in the two settlements. In the International Settlement: 1. The vacant lot at the intersection of North Henan Road and Old Bazili Road; 2. The vacant lot at the intersection of Avenue du Roi Albert and Carter Road (temporary price-controlled sales locations are currently being set up); 3. The Jade Buddha Temple. In the French Concession: 1. The Shandong Guild Hall on Avenue de Zikawei is still under negotiation; another location is being sought. The Rice Trade Association has scheduled a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 10th to discuss the procedures for price-controlled sales and to assign personnel. It is planned to start price-controlled sales at one or two locations next week.

Commercial Press: Price-Controlled Rice Sales for Employees

In view of the recent high rice prices in Shanghai and the difficulties faced by its employees, the Commercial Press has specially purchased rice to hold price-controlled sales. The price-controlled sales measures set by the library are as follows: (1) The company will allocate 30,000 yuan as a fund for purchasing rice for price-controlled sales to all colleagues in Shanghai. (2) All colleagues in Shanghai with a monthly salary of less than 100 yuan are entitled to the benefits of price-controlled sales. (3) Those who enjoy the benefits of price-controlled sales are entitled to a maximum of 80 jin per month, graded according to their needs, as follows: A. Students, female workers, and male employees living alone in Shanghai may each purchase 20 jin of price-controlled rice per month (equivalent to 1 dou 2.5 sheng). B. Male employees whose wives, children, or directly related elders supported by them live together in Shanghai, with a total of two people, may purchase 50 jin of price-controlled rice per month (equivalent to 3 dou 1.25 sheng). D. Male employees whose wives, children, or directly related elders supported by them live together in Shanghai, with a total of three people, may purchase 60 jin of price-controlled rice per month (equivalent to 3 dou 7.5 sheng) (If there are more than two children or directly related elders supported by them, it is still counted as two people). E. Male employees whose wives, children, or directly related elders supported by them live together in Shanghai, with a total of four people, may purchase 70 jin of price-controlled rice per month (equivalent to 4 dou 3.75 sheng) (If there are more than two children or directly related elders supported by them, it is still counted as two people). F. Male employees whose wives, children, or directly related elders supported by them live together in Shanghai, with a total of five people, may purchase 80 jin of price-controlled rice per month (equivalent to 5 dou) (If there are more than two children or directly related elders supported by them, it is still counted as two people).

Price per Shi Sold to Colleagues

(4) The price of the price-controlled rice will be 15 yuan per shi when the company's purchase cost is within 40 yuan per shi. If the cost exceeds 40 yuan per shi, the selling price to colleagues will be the sum of the excess and 15 yuan. For example, if the cost is 45 yuan per shi, the selling price to colleagues should be calculated at 20 yuan per shi. (5) The company will issue price-controlled rice coupons to all colleagues in Shanghai who meet the requirements of Article 2, according to the grades in Article 3, on a monthly basis. However, if a leave of absence is taken for more than one consecutive month or accumulates to more than two months within half a year, the issuance will be suspended once. (6) The company will treat the losses from price-controlled sales as public welfare expenses. If the price-controlled sales fund is insufficient to purchase an adequate amount of rice, the company will consider allocating additional funds. (7) When the rice price returns to within 15 yuan per shi, the price-controlled sales measures will be cancelled, and all (8) remaining funds will be returned to the company. (6) In order to handle price-controlled sales and investigate the family situation of employees, the company will appoint several people from the Shanghai-based colleagues to form a price-controlled sales committee. (9) These measures will be implemented from September of the 28th year and will be implemented on a trial basis for six months. (10) Detailed rules for the implementation of these measures will be formulated separately.

### The Sand and Gravel Market is Completely Stalled; Profiteering by Taking Over Sales in the Name of Various Groups; Cutting Sand Prices on Fixed Orders

Most of the sand and gravel merchants in this city were originally in Wusong. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, they have moved to the concessions to operate. Since the recent control by the Japanese, the sand and gravel market in this city has been in a completely stalled state. Moreover, a few unscrupulous elements in the Sand and Gravel Trade Association are trying to monopolize the business and seize the opportunity to take over sales in the name of the Jiangnan Industrial Company's military sand and gravel, effectively engaging in a forced occupation. It has been learned that the goods sold include 100 tons of yellow sand sold to the Southern Section of Sichuan Road Bridge on the 5th of this month, another 250 tons on the 6th, another 150 tons of yellow sand on North Suzhou Road, and another 300 tons. It is said that the boatmen are only given 5.5 yuan per ton for the sand, while the selling price is 22 yuan per ton. Not only are the boatmen complaining endlessly, but the yellow sand that has been forcibly seized is all from the orders of other colleagues. A request has been submitted to the authorities to provide relief. It is feared that if the situation escalates, it will affect the city's construction industry and have a significant impact. It is heard that the authorities will strictly prevent the monopolization by unscrupulous merchants, so as to stabilize the sand and gravel market and avoid the panic of stagnation.

Shanghai's British and American Business Circles are Developing Towards Yunnan and Guizhou; Socony and Asiatic Petroleum Establish Branches in Yunnan and Sichuan; Ford and Dunlop are Also Planning to Establish Factories

Mr. Wang Xiaolai recently sent a telegram from Hong Kong, urging the Shanghai Chinese and foreign business circles to actively invest in the development of the Southwest. It is learned that the foreigners in this city are very interested in the rapid development of the Southwest. Socony, an American company, and Asiatic Petroleum, a British company, have both established large-scale branches in Yunnan and Sichuan. Ford Motor Company and Dunlop Tire Company are also planning to establish factories in various places in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. In addition, many other foreign businessmen are also planning to invest heavily in the Southwest. These businessmen are all financial and industrial giants from Britain and the United States, including bankers, industrialists, and miners. They have both capital and rich experience. Their investment and development goals focus on the establishment of mines and heavy industrial factories, so as to obtain raw materials and increase production efficiency. The destination is Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, because these two provinces have rich reserves of nonferrous metals such as gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin, as well as minerals such as oil and coal. It is also heard that they have sent personnel to Chongqing to negotiate with the Chinese government authorities.

### How to Remedy Male Debility and Excessive Desire

We must eradicate harmful fallacies. We often hear some quack doctors say: "Strong sexual desire means a strong body, and weak sexual desire means a weak body." This has harmed countless people! Based on our medical and practical experience, both excessive and weak sexual desire are not the normal state of healthy people. In other words, they are undoubtedly pathological. We have seen many cases of so-called "debility with excessive desire," where the sexual desire is very strong but the body is very weak; and we have personally treated many athletes or sportsmen with very weak sexual function.

In this turbulent era, it is necessary to strengthen the body and restrain sexual desire. Some extremists have even shouted out the proposal to remove the reproductive glands. However, this has its drawbacks. The best way is to nourish the body to enhance its ability to control sexual desire. Crossden said: "The more constant the self-control, the easier and more effective it becomes; this is a natural principle, and later it gradually becomes a habit. The smaller the restraint, the greater the tendency to indulge in lust, which is a sign of illness and will inevitably lead to death sooner or later!" These are indeed words of wisdom, which should be deeply engraved in the hearts of every man and woman. As for athletes and sportsmen, the reproductive function is weakened due to excessive development, which is a great loss in love and needs to be adjusted.

Why is a dignified man debilitated? It must be because of early masturbation and nocturnal emission, or early marriage and indulgence in lust, which has exhausted the reproductive gland fluid. Then, symptoms such as dizziness, premature aging, neurasthenia, incomplete development, and premature aging will arise. Therefore, there are many diseases and pains. Not only is it impossible to succeed in school and be capable in handling affairs, but also the couple's life is not satisfactory. However, there are frequent desires and no self-control ability at all. How can this not arouse the hatred of the wife and lead to various tragedies in the family? To seek remedy, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" is the most effective and specific treatment. This agent is extracted from the reproductive glands of strong animals such as gorillas, sea dogs, bears, and deer, and is combined with precious raw materials to nourish the brain and kidneys. It is reproduced using the most precise scientific methods, so its quality is high and its effect is great, surpassing any similar preparation. Therefore, it can generate essence and nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain and activate blood, and nourish nerves within one day and night after taking it. Continued use can help development and adjust metabolism. It can fundamentally cure various symptoms in a short period of time and enhance the self-control ability of sexual desire. As for those whose reproductive function is reduced due to excessive development, it can also be gradually increased to adjust it. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can also benefit longevity, rejuvenation, and anti-aging effects. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Simito's Jing Consolidation Tablets" to consolidate the essence gate and prevent leakage, so that the effect will be even faster.

Beauty

### The Breasts and Hygiene During Puberty

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

After each girl experiences menarche, there is a unique change in her physiology. In addition to the growth of many black and curved soft hairs in the local area and under the armpits, the most obvious change is that the originally not very plump buttocks appear with widened hip bones and plump flesh. And the pair of breasts in front of the chest will fade away from the small coin-sized shape and become a hemispherical bulge that is full and resilient. With eyes like a pool of autumn water, when seeing a strange man, they will secretly glance at him as if shy. Smiles that greet people often appear on the cheeks. The temperament and tone are even more gentle. The manners and demeanor everywhere show the wonderful characteristics of a "virgin."

Ah! The two words "virgin" are so beautiful and intoxicating! However, this period is also the most dangerous period in a woman's life. On the one hand, there is the change in physiology and the stimulation of hormones in the body. On the other hand, they are also tempted by the people, events, and scenery of the outside world, making it extremely easy for those with weak will to secretly commit masturbation. The most common disadvantage of masturbation is that it can cause abnormal menstruation or stop it due to abnormalities. As a result, all kinds of morbidities appear, causing the breasts that dominate women's health and happiness to suddenly wither! The ovarian function is also abnormally weakened, and the metabolism also loses its ability to nourish. As a result, the thigh muscles become thin and the face becomes haggard. Not only will they fail in the competition for beauty in the future! And once they enter into sexual life, they will inevitably lead to symptoms of unresponsiveness and infertility, which will be hated by their husbands and have no happiness! Therefore, women must cherish themselves at this time so that the breasts can develop well. If they are harmed by menstrual irregularities, leukorrhea, unresponsiveness, malnutrition, etc., causing them to wither or show a state of sagging and drooping, they should not hesitate to take the female "Shengzhisu" recommended by Chinese and foreign doctors. The ingredients of this agent are very precious, and all kinds of women's hidden diseases can be cured by medicine, like an echo. And this agent is especially effective for the withering of female breasts.

### The Harm of Nocturnal Emission to the Body

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

A man from youth to adulthood will always have the experience of nocturnal emission! Some people have had nocturnal emission, but their bodies are still as strong as ever, but some people have become haggard and have all kinds of diseases due to nocturnal emission. Why is this?

This is very common sense. An adult man has too much semen produced due to being unmarried or being separated from his beloved wife for too long. Sometimes, ejaculation occurs due to slight stimulation and fatigue. This cannot be regarded as a morbid state, and the number of times is also extremely small, at most once or twice a month. Of course, there will be no impact on health. In addition, there are some youths who are confused for a while and commit masturbation and indulgence in lust, which hurts the nerves and relaxes the sperm gate, followed by nocturnal emission. But he quickly realized it, and on the one hand, he cleared his heart and reduced his desires, and abstained from masturbation. On the other hand, he must take the most effective "Simito's Jing Consolidation Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves. Therefore, it can also be fundamentally cured in the shortest possible time. Nocturnal emission can be made and planned to be completely cured, and it will not cause much harm to the body!

The worst thing is that everyone thinks that nocturnal emission has no pain or itching, and neglects treatment. As a result, the sperm gate becomes more and more relaxed, the nerves become more and more weak, and the semen becomes more and more exhausted. Symptoms such as weak brain and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney weakness and premature ejaculation, and scattered energy will arise. This is because the brain, spinal cord, and sex are the three major nerves that have been injured. In addition, the development function is also stagnated, and the metabolic function is also reduced. Therefore, there are often youths who have nocturnal emission who are adults but their whole body is like a child, and there are more people who are still young but have shown signs of aging! How can this kind of weak and incompetent person still struggle on the journey of life? I am afraid that even between husband and wife, due to the unsatisfactory sexual life, the wife will hate him, or even stage tragedies such as elopement and divorce! Nocturnal emission is not an incurable disease. We have said it again and again, but when the symptoms deteriorate, in order to seek cure, in addition to still taking "Simito's Jing Consolidation Tablets," it is necessary to actively take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" to fundamentally cultivate and nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you can continue to take it, you will definitely be able to fundamentally cure all symptoms in a short period of time. Regular use can also prolong life, prolong life, and rejuvenate.

Leukorrhea Forum

### Reasons for the Sudden Recurrence of Gonorrhea

Many cases of gonorrhea often become superficially healed without being noticed. However, in fact, it cannot be said that this type of gonorrhea has been completely cured. On the contrary, this phenomenon is not a good omen. It is the root of recurrence in the future. Based on my years of experience, once gonorrhea enters a chronic stage, patients often think it has been cured. As a result, they act recklessly. Once the virus erupts again, they do not know what to do, thinking that they have not visited prostitutes, so how can they have leukorrhea again. It is really like a monk Zhang Er, unable to figure it out. In fact, these patients mostly took inferior drugs that were not right for the symptoms at the beginning of gonorrhea, forcing the poison inside, or were forced to flee inward by bad surgery, thus triggering various secondary complications. There are many examples, such as acute gonorrhea's leukorrhea. Gonococci mostly cluster in the anterior urethra. At that time, the inflammation is raging. Local surgery has no way to start, and even if internal medicine has no side effects, it will not help the emergency. It does not help the matter. Moreover, delaying the time and turning urgency into slowness is only enough to spoil things.

Therefore, the secret to seeking a quick cure for gonorrhea is not to take proprietary medicines on the market privately, and not to blindly undergo mediocre surgery with outdated equipment and shallow experience, and patients should take care of themselves. Then, use specially made autogenous vaccines to increase the body's own resistance. At the same time, take chemotherapy and use German filtrate flat current therapy to completely and directly wipe out the gonococci hidden in the reproductive system, urinary system, and blood. In this way, any gonorrhea can be completely cured within a limited time.

### The Japanese Side Believes it Was Done by the Arson Group Again; Japanese Ships are Negligent Twice; Coolies Released After Questioning Names

Since this year, fires have occurred frequently in the Hongkou District. The Japanese side believes that they were caused by anti-Japanese arson groups. Although they have been strictly investigated repeatedly, they have not been able to stop them. However, the merchant ship Shun Maru of the Kobe City Maru Transportation Company, which was moored at the 19th pontoon in front of the "Fish Market" in Yangshupu, caught fire twice the day before yesterday and yesterday morning. The ship came to Shanghai and was moored there, loading a large batch of cotton and wheat to Qingdao. It was not expected that at about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, when the coolies were loading, they suddenly saw black smoke rising from the cotton pile. After rescue, it was extinguished. It was later heard that the Japanese side had found an igniter. Unexpectedly, while the case was still under secret investigation, the ship caught fire again at about 5:00 AM yesterday morning, just as it was about to set anchor and leave Shanghai. The wheat warehouse of Mitsui & Co. in the No. 2 cargo hold suddenly caught fire again. It was discovered and extinguished again. At the same time, an igniter was also found inside. At that time, the Japanese side believed that the two fires were very suspicious of the coolies who were handling the goods. They questioned 20 coolies one by one. Because there was no clue, they were released.

### Bomb Explodes in Trash Can

At about 12:00 PM yesterday, a scavenger about 40 years old was looking down at the trash can next to the back door of the Hexing Tea House in Ziyang Lane, Yangwei Bridge, Lafayette Road, in the French Concession, picking up trash. Unexpectedly, there was a sudden explosion. It was found that two fingers of the scavenger's left hand had been blown off. Blood splattered all over his body. He fell to the ground in extreme pain. The police station was notified by the patrolman, and officers were dispatched to the scene to seize small grenade fragments and buttons, etc., and take them back for investigation. The injured person was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

### Zhang Suichu Arrested for Selling Opium

The Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police has learned that Zhang Suichu from Qingpu is selling opium. Therefore, on the morning of the day before yesterday, detectives were ordered to go to Zhang to negotiate and planned to purchase 20 taels of opium. Zhang and his relative Yong Yu Songhe negotiated in the reception room. As a result, the price was set at 17 yuan per tael. The detectives first paid a deposit of 100 yuan. Zhang issued a receipt and agreed to deliver the goods between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM, and then pay the balance. At the time, the detective and his colleagues went on time. In addition to Zhang and Yu, Zhou Shan, a partner of Hengchang Earth Company, also participated. After a while, a postman from a certain number sent a paper bag and handed it to Zhang. Zhang then handed the paper bag to the detectives. At this moment, the detectives rushed in and arrested Zhang, Yu, and Zhou. 23 and a half taels of opium were seized. The 100 yuan deposit paid by the detectives in the morning was also found next to Zhou Runshan. They were all taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court 1 of the First Special District Court. Judge Feng Shide questioned them. The police lawyer Ru Bao Chenming described the process and prosecuted them for selling and transporting opium under Article 5 of the Anti-Smoking Regulations. He also said that because this case still needs to be investigated, he asked to postpone the interrogation and submitted the statements written by Yu Songhe and Zhou Runshan at the police station. Then, the detective voted for the process of negotiation. Judge Feng asked the three defendants in detail and approved the police station's request to announce that the defendants would be remanded in custody and rescheduled for interrogation.

Lawyer Yang Yishi, a local, is 28 years old. He has an office at No. 57 Tianxiang Lane, Rue du Père Huc. He lives at No. 33 Siyi Village, West Street, Xujiahui. Mrs. Song Wang (50 years old), a local woman who used to live at No. 133 Triangle Land, Xujiahui, had a dispute with her 20-year-old daughter-in-law Song Zhang and her son Song Wenyu, and once even got involved in litigation. Recently, she ran away from home, so she secretly went out to investigate. Until about 2:00 PM on the 7th, she was informed by a friend that her daughter-in-law was now in Lawyer Yang's residence, so she rushed to negotiate at the address. Unexpectedly, due to a disagreement, she was beaten by Yang with punches and kicks on the spot. Song reported to the French Police, who summoned Yang for questioning. Because Yang was a lawyer, he was not detained. Yesterday, he was transferred to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Qiu attended the Criminal Court 8 for interrogation. The plaintiff, Song Wang, described the beating and said that she saw her daughter-in-law and the defendant Yang Yishi sitting on the same bed and talking and laughing. Then, the witness Ye Tang proved that Song was beaten by Yang at the time. When the defendant was questioned, he flatly denied the above facts and hired lawyer Wei Weiqing to defend him. After checking the records in court, he was instructed to reschedule the hearing for the 20th of this month. Song Wang was sent to the doctor for injury verification.

Ye Qi, a woman from Nanjing, recently came to Shanghai from her hometown to escape the war. She lived in the home of Jing Gu, a woman from Yangzhou, at No. 696 Maqi Road, for about a month. Unexpectedly, Ye Qi saw that Jing Zhou's 17-year-old daughter, Aqiao, was not bad-looking. At about 6:00 PM on May 20th, she colluded with a person named Xiao Chen, who was on the run, to lure the girl out. They falsely claimed to her mother, Jing Zhou, that they would introduce her to a cigarette factory for work. They took the opportunity to drive her to Nanjing and resell her to a merchant in Xuzhou as a concubine or to start a prostitute's life. It is not known what the details are. She got 400 yuan.

Then, according to the girl's mother, Jing Zhou, she used to rely on working in a yarn factory to earn a living. As a result, Ye Qi was sentenced to five years in prison.

### Young Woman Unwilling to Marry Early; Fiancé Has Already Married Someone Else; Sues Fiancé for Compensation for Damages

Yao Ruiyun, a local girl, is 17 years old. On August 14th last year, she was engaged to Zhu Yunshang, a local resident of No. 745 Peidong Road, Xujiahui, through matchmakers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Youlan, at the Atlantic Vegetable Society. Both parties met at the Gujiazhai Garden and the 2nd floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge. Because her fiancé was a Catholic, Yao also entered Catholicism, hoping not to be separated in heaven. Unexpectedly, this spring, Zhu suddenly married another woman because his request for an early marriage was not fulfilled. Last month, he actually married another woman. Yao was extremely angry. Recently, her father Yao Zhikui, as the legal representative, commissioned lawyer Chao Kun to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the Second Special District, suing Zhu Yunshang for compensation of 1,000 yuan in national currency. The case was heard by Judge Yu Changzi in Civil Court 7 yesterday. Because the case involved a marital dispute between the two families, he persuaded the two families to go out for reconciliation. If reconciliation fails, the hearing will be rescheduled for the 16th of this month. The two families withdrew as instructed.

### Italian Tourist Kidnapped, Released After Three Hours: Forced into Car by Armed Chinese, Taken to a House for Questioning and Then Returned

The *North-China Daily News* reports that an Italian man, Francesco, who had been touring Shanghai for about eight days, was kidnapped yesterday (the 8th) shortly after 7:00 PM. After leaving the St. Anne's Apartments on Rue du Consulat, he was released three hours later. As of this morning (the 9th), French Concession detectives are still questioning Mr. Francesco in conjunction with the Italian consulate. Apparently, Mr. Francesco went to St. Anne's Apartments to visit a friend. Upon leaving, he was suddenly forced into a car waiting by the roadside by three armed Chinese men, who bound his hands and blindfolded him. Therefore, Mr. Francesco does not know where he was taken. Several minutes later, he found himself in a Western-style house, but he does not know the address of the house, as he has only been in Shanghai for a short time. The kidnappers asked Mr. Francesco if he was Italian. He replied yes, and they then asked his name, which Mr. Francesco told them. Upon hearing this, the three Chinese men seemed embarrassed, apparently realizing they had kidnapped the wrong person. They then asked where he was staying, and Mr. Francesco replied that he lived on Avenue Albert. The three men then re-blindfolded Mr. Francesco, put him back in the car, drove him to the corner of Avenue Henri and Avenue Albert, and ordered him to get out of the car, forbidding him to return; otherwise, they would shoot him. Mr. Francesco complied and went to a restaurant opposite the Cercle Sportif Français, where he reported the incident to the Italian consulate and the French Concession police. It is known that at least one Italian lawyer resides in St. Anne's Apartments. The police are currently investigating to determine whether the intended target was the Italian lawyer.

According to the lawsuit, the defendants, on the 28th of last month, jointly commissioned the first defendant to publish an advertisement in major newspapers in this city, intentionally defaming him. The advertisement stated, "According to the parties concerned, the ancestral graves located in Tushanwan have been the burial place for ancestors since the great-grandfather, and each branch takes turns managing it. Unexpectedly, Zhang Yucang of the eldest branch privately engraved the Guangyu Tang seal and leased the land to Renyu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, which is a clear violation of Article 828, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code. Moreover, the overflowing sewage and violent vibrations of the machinery cause unrest underground. How can descendants bear it? We request that he be punished according to the law." The court accepted the case, and yesterday, Judge Zhu summoned them for trial. After the plaintiff stated the circumstances, the defendants also appeared in court to be questioned. After a detailed hearing, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced on September 13th.

Wan was also asleep at the time, and Zhao immediately used the axe to strike his head, fortunately missing and hitting the wooden board. Lu Guicheng, greatly frightened, grabbed him around the waist and called out to other workers, Huang Zhenjuan, Chen Guanyou, and others. They immediately reported to the Puthuo Road police station, which sent Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest Zhao and take him into custody.

### Woman from North Jiangsu Shot in the Wuchiao Market, Tsaokadoo, Yesterday Morning: Rumors of a Dispute and Shooting between the "Self-Defense Corps" and Police; Another Story Claims Someone Tried to Shoot a Bodyguard at a Gambling Den

The Shewen News Agency reports that at 8:45 AM yesterday, several gunshots suddenly rang out near the Wuchiao Market on Route Tenant de la Tour, Tsaokadoo, in western Shanghai. Stray bullets were flying everywhere, one of which struck a female pedestrian from North Jiangsu, Wang Dajie (23 years old), in the face. She was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, it was rumored that the shooting occurred because a Chinese policeman stationed there had a dispute with the local pseudo "Self-Defense Corps," and the "Self-Defense Corps" opened fire as a show of force. However, another rumor claims that a man tried to shoot another man riding in a rickshaw, but missed, and the shooter fled the scene. The bullet, however, hit Miss Wang. Yet another story says that the target was Zhang Jipin, a bodyguard at the Hollywood gambling den. Since the incident occurred in the extraterritorial area, it is impossible to ascertain the details.

### Children's Self-Governing Organizations

— Yang Chunlu

The new semester has begun! Children live in groups at school. The most important thing in group life is self-governing organizations. With self-governing organizations, we can not only combine the power of unity and the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, but also organize many group activities. Everyone learns the ability to serve from doing, and will definitely achieve great results in serving the society and the country in the future.

The organization of self-governing groups should be from the bottom up, from small groups to large unions. Children of all grades should first organize "grade meetings." Representatives should be elected from the grade meetings according to the proportion of the number of people, and jointly form a "school meeting." These grade meetings and school meetings can also imitate local self-governing organizations, with one grade as one township or one district, establishing a township office or district office; and the entire school as a city or town, establishing a city hall or town hall. Or, imitating the baojia system, each classmate is a household, and they are the head of the household; every ten people or one row is one jia, and a jia head is set; each grade is one bao, and a bao head is set; the whole school is combined into one township or town, and a township head or town head is set. After the lower-level groups are organized well, the upper-level ones are organized.

The various activities in the self-governing organization should be organized according to the needs of actual life. First organize the things needed in daily life, and then merge many small groups into one large organization. The meetings of all grades should have sections such as discipline, library, lectures, arrangements, grade publications, and sanitation to manage the affairs of the grade. The school meeting should set up inspection teams, small hospitals, cleaning teams, newspaper offices, libraries, playgrounds, entertainment clubs, small banks, cooperatives, and other institutions to handle the affairs of the school. But don't just create empty titles and set up many formal organizations, which would only cultivate lazy habits.

Children, in a group, individuals cannot be free, and must abide by the discipline of the group and obey the rules of the group. If everyone agrees with something, but I disagree; if everyone disagrees, but I insist on doing it! In this way, the result will be to destroy the group, and nothing will be accomplished. Therefore, we must all abide by the law, and that is true self-government.

### A Story of Busyness

— Ling

Wu Ming buried his head in writing large characters, but mumbled in his mouth: "It's really too busy! I just wiped the table and swept the floor, and I have to write characters again, and I have to do arithmetic in a while." His mother happened to come out of the kitchen and, hearing his words, said with a smile: "Wu'er is really too busy and working too hard. How about I give you a week off?" He eagerly asked: "Mom, are you not kidding me? A week is too short, how about a few more days?" "How can I lie to you! As for the number of days, it's up to you, as long as you are satisfied, as long as you are not busy, I have no problem. But in these days, you can't play, because playing is also a busy thing, aren't you afraid of being busy?" Wu Ming agreed to his mother's terms. He thought that he would not have to be busy doing things all day long, and he would definitely be very happy.

He was originally a lazy child who was afraid of being busy. His mother always wanted to change his bad temper, so she wanted to implement her plan during this summer vacation, so she specially set up a work schedule, which included several hours of reviewing lessons, several hours of helping with housework, and the rest of the time could be used for playing. He had no way to disobey, so he had to do it. Unexpectedly, the school was about to start, but his old temper still hadn't changed. How disappointed his mother was!

The next morning, he didn't get up until nine o'clock. Today, he doesn't have to help his mother with housework, and he doesn't have to review textbooks. How free and how free he is. His body also seems to be a little lighter and more refreshed. He just ate, drank, slept, and did nothing for three days, and gradually felt that the days were getting longer and longer, his stomach was uncomfortably bloated, his mother became estranged from him, he was terribly idle, panicked, bored, it was not good to sit, and it was even worse to stand. He envied the workers who were busy building houses and the bees who were busy collecting honey. In less than five days, he walked to his mother and said as if repenting: "Mom, I don't want to be idle anymore, and I won't be lazy anymore. From now on, no matter what you tell me to do, I won't say I'm busy, and I'm not afraid of being busy, because when I'm busy, I feel happy, my stomach doesn't bloat anymore, the days don't get longer anymore, and you taught me to learn many things and gained new experience, especially the fun of playing in the spare time, which is even more interesting. School is about to start, and I'm no longer afraid of being busy with homework and busy with exams. I also want to...I also want to tell my classmates, don't be afraid of being busy, being busy is beneficial to us!" The mother smiled and nodded.

### Refugee Picture

— Made by a child, Jiang Xiaoliu

### Lost

— Bai Zheng

—The Thirty-Third Record of Ming'er's Escape—

A group of refugees spent a miserable night in the moldy, damp environment of the transit house. Finally, unable to withstand its oppression, they escaped its sphere of influence—the transit house—in the hazy, misty dawn.

The three sedan chairs that had been hired last night were still dozing off, not arriving yet. Those riding in the sedan chairs waited patiently. The group on foot—Ming'er volunteered to join, led by Zhang's wife—took the lead and set foot on the mountain road. After almost an hour, the sedan chairs caught up like flying. After all, two feet could not compete with four feet. Ming'er's mother and younger brother's sedan chair took the lead, followed by the two sedan chairs of Mr. Li's family. The porters proudly passed their group, seemingly laughing at their uselessness. Ming'er felt his lagging behind and, unconvinced, closely followed behind the sedan chairs, not letting go a single step, like a dog chasing a rabbit, gradually leaving the group on foot far behind, even losing sight of them.

On the mountain road, the scenery changed with Ming'er's steps. Sometimes, there were cliffs thousands of feet high, blocking the way. After turning a corner, it was a completely different scene. Sometimes, small streams gurgled down from the mountain cliffs. Sometimes, the mountain road was so narrow that it could only accommodate one foot. If the mountain soil loosened, one would fall into a mountain ravine thousands of feet deep. He only cared about moving his feet on the road and looking at the traces of the sedan chairs. He had no intention of appreciating the scenery along the road.

After carrying the sedan chairs for a while, the porters went to the tea stalls specially set up by the roadside to smoke and drink tea. Ming'er said proudly to his mother: "Mom, my leg strength is really not bad. I can't even see the shadow of their group. They walk so slowly." His mother was stunned for a moment because she didn't know he was following behind. She only told him to walk slowly.

The porters rested many times like this, which clearly meant they had traveled a considerable distance. The sedan chairs also finally left the rugged mountain road and stepped onto the flat stone road. Because of the fields and paths, they wound their way into the forest. Thousands of towering old trees stood with their teeth and claws exposed. When a gust of wind blew, they creaked, as if they were fighting. Agile squirrels flew from the tree trunks to another branch, jumping back and forth very familiarly. The porters walked on flat ground, and their feet became more active, adding speed and flying forward. The sedan chairs passed through this small village, and after turning a corner, it was another village. The road was so winding that Ming'er couldn't make heads or tails of it. He hesitated suddenly, and the sedan chairs disappeared in the blink of an eye. He ran a distance quickly, but still didn't see them. The road was crisscrossed, and he couldn't help but feel a little anxious.

He finally decided to follow the main road, regardless of whether it was right or wrong. Walk! Walk! Walk! He passed through many villages, spoke in the mixed Shanghai dialect, and asked many questions, but still found no trace of them. At the time of departure, three steamed buns filled his empty stomach, but at that time it really didn't satisfy his appetite. Now, it had been a long hour or so, and he had walked a lot of distance. His stomach was rumbling and needed food to replenish it, but he was still searching for the whereabouts of the sedan chairs on the road, and there was still no news. Under these two pressures, he became even more anxious.

Ming'er resolutely walked towards the main road, constantly moving his feet. Because the soles of his shoes rubbed against the rough stone surface, heat was generated. He felt that his feet were burning, and then every step he took, there was a burst of pain, but he still continued to search. Finally, in the depths of the forest, he discovered a flash of the sedan chairs. He was so happy that he shouted as if he had discovered some treasure, and he moved the speed of his legs and feet to an extreme, like a sprinter in a 100-meter race. At this time, he ignored everything else. Only "catch up with the sedan chairs" was his only goal.

When the sun was right above Ming'er's head, it was noon, and they finally completed the final leg of the journey. Where did they arrive at, in Ming'er's eyes, a haven of peace in a chaotic world?

### Using Old Books and Cherishing New Books

— Ying Dai

A few days of autumn wind and autumn rain brought the coolness of autumn, and the schools also started classes one after another at this time. Now prices are soaring, and the burden on parents has increased. Children! You should all know this. Therefore, we must be extremely frugal with everything, whether it is food or things we use. When studying at school, perhaps parents are gathering expenses to allow you to study during this time of extreme economic panic in order to prevent you from dropping out of school. Then, in order to be considerate of your parents, you should save on all expenses!

What I want to point out here in particular is the books used in school. Recently, the price of books used in middle schools has increased by 50%, and the price of books used in elementary schools has increased by 80%. Original Western books are even more frighteningly expensive. Therefore, we must especially cherish books so that we don't have to buy them if we don't need to, and reduce some of the expenses for our parents. The best way is to use old books. For example, for the books used in school, if your older brothers and sisters have read them at home, you can find the old books to read; if you don't have any familiar classmates at home who are one or two grades higher than you, ask them if they have any old books that you should use. If they do, you can borrow them; if you can't borrow them, then you might as well go to a used bookstore or a used book stall to hunt for them. Buying used books is cheaper than buying new books!

As a last resort, if you can't borrow or buy used books, and you have to buy new books, you should cherish the new books you buy even more. You must not let your new books be stolen or lost. You must take good care of them. For several years, I have been teaching in school, and I often see some children buying new books, and they will lose them in a few days. If they lose them, they will buy another one, and it is common for them to replace the same book four or five times in a semester. We should quickly eliminate this bad habit, especially in this year when book prices are particularly expensive. Moreover, this kind of negligence not only wastes the hard-earned money of parents, but also cultivates a bad habit of not knowing how to take care of clothes and losing things casually when they grow up. Not only should books be cherished, but other school supplies, a piece of paper, a pencil, should also be saved, and should not be used indiscriminately and thrown away at will.

### In the Realm of Animals (17)

Peng Qi felt so sorry for such a small tropical fish, which shows that his heart has indeed changed from cruel to kind. Unexpectedly, another tragic thing happened in the end, which completely softened his heart.

It turned out that when Peng Qi was rescued from the water by Knox and brought to the willow tree, and then sent home from the willow tree, the dog Le Fu saw him in that dying state, and it followed him all the way into the house, wanting to see what was wrong with its little master, whether he was saved or not. At that time, everyone in the family was busy rescuing Peng Qi, and they found Le Fu to be in the way and annoying, so they called a servant to take it out and lock it in the doghouse outside the house, not allowing it to come out. During Peng Qi's illness, Le Fu never saw him once. Peng Qi's parents were very anxious about Peng Qi's illness, and the two younger sisters were also often at the bedside taking care of him, so no one paid attention to Le Fu. Sometimes, although the servant would release it from the doghouse to walk around, as soon as it came out of the doghouse, it would run around in the house, clearly wanting to see its little master. The servant was afraid that it would disturb Peng Qi and affect his illness, so he simply locked it in the doghouse and no longer opened it. The food was placed by its mouth, and it ate by itself, but because Le Fu was depressed, its appetite deteriorated day by day, and it didn't want to eat much. A cat climbed down from the roof, looking at its old enemy, with a mocking look. A mouse saw that it had a bad appetite and didn't want to eat, so it unceremoniously stole its bread crust. Le Fu just lay there motionless, even its eyes and nose were frozen, not moving. Oh, it just wanted to smell the scent of Peng Qi's body, so maybe he had walked past outside. It also hoped that Peng Qi's whip would strike down, or kick it a few times with his toe. In short, no matter how he treated it, it would be good! So it just twitched its nose, or wagged its tail, or exposed its small teeth more than a dozen times. Poor little body, holding a painful heart, was still thinking about its cruel little master there.

### New Soviet Film, "Peter the Great Continued," Comes to Shanghai

— (Feiming)

Recently, Soviet films screened in Shanghai seem to be quite active. I heard that three new films have arrived a few days ago and will be released one after another.

The first one is the sequel to "Peter the Great." Shanghai moviegoers know a lot about "Peter the Great." When it premiered at the Cathay last year, it was a grand occasion. In addition to winning the Gold Medal First Prize at the Paris International Film Festival, its screenwriter (Tolstoy), director (Petrov), and leading actor (Simonov, who played Peter the Great) were also awarded the Lenin Medal, the highest honor awarded by the Soviet government. The sequel that will be premiered in Shanghai is still played by the original cast. The story is based on the second part of Little Tolstoy's famous book "Peter the Great." The Leningrad Film Factory, which produced this film, originally planned to produce the third part, but because Little Tolstoy had not yet written the third part, it was temporarily put on hold.

The central theme of "Peter the Great Continued" is: the Russian-Swedish "Poltava" War two hundred and thirty years ago; the Russian-Swedish naval battle in the Baltic Sea in the same year; Peter the Great executed the crown prince—the rebellious Alexei. Both the production surface and the performance results are more advanced than the initial episode.

The second film is "Alexander Nevsky." This depicts the historical event of Alexander Nevsky, Count of Novogrudok in Russia in the 13th century, leading his army to defeat the German invading army. It was written and directed by Eisenstein, the most famous senior director in the Soviet Union. The actor who plays Alexander is Cherkasov, the meritorious artist who was called "the Soviet Bao Zhaomoni" by the Americans.

The war scenes account for more than half of the film, and this is a battle from seven hundred years ago. At that time, there were no guns, only swords, spears, and halberds, so almost all the battles were hand-to-hand combat. The greatest scene of the battle was on the frozen Chutskoye Lake. The German army was too heavily armored. After the battle, the ice floes broke apart, and the men and horses all fell into the sea, and the entire army was wiped out.

The third film is Pushkin's fairy tale poem "Ruslan and Lyudmila." This is a very bizarre film because there are many scenes of strange fights in it. The performance of the whole film is very special: someone behind the scenes recites the scary verses of Pushkin, and the silver screen performs the story according to the meaning of the verses.

This film was produced by the Moscow Film Factory. The screenwriters and directors are both Nikitevich and Nevigin.

### Aluminum Film

— Yujun

Not Easily Damaged and Does Not Catch Fire; Extremely Low Cost, Both Sides Can Be Used

Fischer Film Company of the United States has recently invented a new type of opaque film made of aluminum. It is projected by reflection, and the pictures and sounds emitted are very complete. Existing transparent shadow dramas can be used to print this kind of metal positive film.

This new type of film has many advantages. The most obvious is that it is not as flammable as ordinary celluloid film, does not produce any gas, and is not easily damaged. The company has repeatedly projected a roll of aluminum film one thousand five hundred times, and as a result, no obvious wear and tear occurred.

Other advantages are that it does not wrinkle, crack, or mildew, and it is resistant to moisture. Because it is resistant to heat and cold, it can be used in cold and hot regions; not to mention in temperate regions. Also, because it is opaque and both sides can be used, ordinary celluloid film requires 1,000 feet, while aluminum film only requires half the length—500 feet. In addition, the price of the aluminum film itself is very low, so the cost of this brand of film is extremely low, and the future is unlimited.

### Unofficial Tales of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Son of a Flute Player Becomes Mayor

Although Jin Fu was an experienced makeup artist, he couldn't figure out how to draw a tall nose for the half-dead character, just randomly gesturing with the makeup brush without daring to apply it. (Gesturing means pretending to apply makeup without actually doing so.) The crowd didn't know whether to laugh or say anything. Who knew the young marshal would guess what was happening, so he snatched the makeup brush from old Qian's hand, stuck it in the character's anus, and said, "I'll give him this tall nose." Such pranks were endless. But later, both Mr. Hu and the son of the flute player became specially appointed officials. If they hadn't allowed others to arrange things for them, how could they have become high officials and enjoyed their original salaries!

After resigning as mayor, the son of the flute player bought residences in places like Beiping, Tianjin, and Beidaihe. When he had time, he also dabbled in the antique business, specializing in selling to foreigners. One day, he asked a fellow villager of mine, surnamed Yang, to invite me and Mr. Zhou Xinfang to a casual meal at his residence in Beiping. The conversation mostly revolved around theater. He suddenly asked Xinfang, "Are there any good flute players in the South? I'd like to hire one or two when I have the chance." He also said that when he was in Guanwai (Northeast China), he had funded the recruitment of twenty or thirty students and hired two flute teachers to teach them to play the flute. Later, one student surnamed Shen became very skilled. Although these students have long since graduated, this Mr. Shen still lives in his house, and he provides him with food and clothing. Finally, he repeatedly emphasized that the relationship between flute playing and singing is too close, even closer and more important than the relationship between the singer and the erhu in a traditional opera troupe. If he has the power in the future, he also wants to ask the government or unite with several like-minded individuals to establish an organization dedicated to cultivating flute players, so as not to betray his lifelong ambition.

### The Mystery of Bai Yang and Lao Gao's Arrival in Shanghai

— Zhi Yue

Xinhua Company Has Remitted Two Thousand Dollars, Chongqing Partners Are Unwilling to Let Them Leave

Bai Yang is an artist that young people think of! Hearing the news that she was coming back to Shanghai to join Xinhua was like a great relief. However, when young people learned that she and Gao Zhanfei were very close, they worried that Gao Qianping would not get along with him. In fact, this problem is relatively easy to solve at Xinhua. Because Zhang Shanxian can consult with Zhu Qingxian in Hong Kong and, if necessary, Bai Yang and Lao Gao do not have to come to Shanghai but can shoot movies at Zhu Qingxian's photography studio in Hong Kong. Other actors can be hired in Hong Kong, or people can be sent from Shanghai. None of this is impossible.

However, "Only the sound of the ladder is heard, but no one comes down." The news about Bai Yang and Lao Gao has been circulating for so long, but there is still no movement. Is this a kind of stalling tactic? Definitely not! It is a fact that Xinhua has remitted two thousand dollars to Bai Yang and Lao Gao from Shanghai. It is also a fact that they agreed to join Xinhua. However, when the news of their impending arrival in Shanghai spread throughout Chongqing, their partners in Chongqing were reluctant to let them leave. In fact, that kind of collective life is too lovely. Under the persuasion of friends, Yang and Lao Gao are also not very willing to leave Chongqing. Although Xinhua has sent telegrams urging them, there has been no formal reply. Therefore, the joining of Bai Yang and Lao Gao to Xinhua has become a mystery.

### Singapore Will Hold an Exhibition of Movie Star Photos

— (Xiong Jian)

The charity exhibition of movie star photos held in Shanghai last month attracted the attention of the art world in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. (Editor's note: It is a pity that the accounts are not clear, which is regrettable.) Recently, Mr. Hu, a representative of a Singaporean film company, came to Shanghai to contact various film companies to purchase copies for screening in Singapore. Mr. Hu met with various friends in Shanghai and talked about the grand occasion of the Shanghai photo exhibition, which aroused his interest. He immediately planned to hold a charity exhibition of movie star photos in Singapore and sent a telegram to the company to inquire about their opinion. The reply was that the company authorities expressed their strong approval and had already cooperated with three well-known Chinese newspapers to carry out the event. The proceeds will be donated. After receiving this reply, Mr. Hu contacted various Shanghai photography reporters to borrow photos of various movie stars, develop and enlarge them, and prepare to hold a grand exhibition.

### Brief News

The Shanghai Liangyou Social Club is scheduled to hold its third rehearsal today (September 10) at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Yu Zhiqing Road. The club president, He Junde, is said to be working very hard.

The Big Bell Drama Club, an amateur organization of drama-loving students from various universities in Shanghai, was officially established last month and has been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. It is reported that the club is currently actively rehearsing Wu Tianzhi's "Zou Yi," Xu Xingzhi's "A Large Well," and Qin Ni Maikesi's "Cuckoo" as the club's first practical performance repertoire.

(Sixteen) Civilization Drama

In my previous article, I said: "The predecessor of spoken drama is civilization drama." From the early Republic to the 1920s, it was its golden age. In recent years, with the rise of spoken drama, civilization drama has gradually been eliminated under the principle of metabolism! Only a few spoken drama troupes in variety show venues still maintain the appearance of civilization drama.

Drama troupes such as "Green Treasure" and "Wang Family Troupe," although their performance styles are close to the new type of spoken drama, still cannot escape the style of "civilization drama."

### An Analysis of German Strategy

— Dexin

Two German Strategies

Only a few days after the outbreak of the Second European War, it is already clear that Germany's operational plan this time is completely different from that of 1914. At that time, the German General Staff adopted the famous Schlieffen Plan: on the Eastern Front, it intended to use the minimum amount of force to contain Russia; on the Western Front, it intended to use its main force, passing through Belgium to pressure France, and take Paris in one fell swoop with "lightning speed." In general, Germany fully intended to solve France first, prevent British troops from setting foot on the European continent; after the Western Front was established, it would then move its main force eastward to deal with Russia.

However, once the war began, the Berlin General Staff became somewhat apprehensive. Because according to the Schlieffen Plan, German East Prussia was in danger of being ravaged by the Russian cavalry. Temporarily, the German forces sent to the Eastern Front were more substantial than the Schlieffen Plan had predicted, and as a result, its right-wing forces in France had to be proportionally reduced.

As for the Allied forces, French Marshal Joffre was able to concentrate his main force, General Maunoury was able to advance eastward from Paris, and British reinforcements arrived in time. As a result, after the Battle of the Marne, the German army suffered a crushing defeat, and the Schlieffen Plan was completely broken. At that time, if Marshal Hindenburg had been able to defeat the Russian army in the Battle of Tannenberg in the Eastern Front and could have been able to allocate forces to General Kluck on the Western Front to implement a flanking strategy to prevent Gallieni from sending troops from Paris, the outcome of the Battle of the Marne would have been very different. This shows the extent to which Germany was pressured by the Russian army and its Western Front enemies in the last European War. Recently, the German-Soviet non-aggression pact has been signed and ratified. Once Germany starts a war, it no longer needs to suffer the pains of being attacked from both East and West as it did between 1914 and 1917, because on the Eastern Front, Poland has replaced Imperial Russia. Although it is still somewhat troublesome, it is much easier. In the eyes of the Germans, Poland has limited strength and is not a strong enemy. It can easily destroy Poland first, and then deal with Britain and France with all its strength. Before Poland collapses, the German army will probably take a defensive stance on the Rhine front, which is exactly the opposite of the strategy of the last European War.

However, Britain and France will certainly not allow Germany to easily destroy Poland. They will do their best to attack its Western Front to reduce the pressure on Poland, so that Germany will still have to deal with the war on both the East and West Fronts at the same time. But Poland is no match for Germany. Germany can take the offensive with a small number of troops in Poland, while concentrating its main force on the Western Front, waiting for Britain and France to attack. Therefore, how long the first stage of the Second European War can last and what the result will be depends largely on how long Poland can resist.

Poland's Difficulties

Poland's main difficulty lies in the border situation between it and Germany. Originally, the German-Polish border was 1,912 kilometers long, accounting for 34.5% of Poland's national border line; only the section bordering East Prussia to the east could be said to have natural barriers (because of many forests, swamps and complicated waterways). In addition, from the Baltic Sea all the way to the Tatra Mountains, the area along the entire German-Polish border is a plain, lacking any major natural obstacles; the situation in Poland's western, central, and northern regions is also the same, with the only exception being east of Galicia and the Vistula River.

According to the observations of ordinary Polish people, the part of the operational plan agreed upon by France and Poland before Czechoslovakia was subjugated, which should be implemented by Poland, was probably this: in Upper Silesia and the Corridor, adopt a defensive strategy, and in Central West Silesia (Breslau) and Berlin, adopt an offensive strategy one after another. The provincial capital of Poland's Poznan province is only a two-hour tram ride from Berlin, but on the German side, not only are the waterways intertwined, making it easy to defend, but also the forts are heavily fortified, making it extremely difficult to attack. Therefore, once Poland goes to war, it should devote all its strength to attacking Central West Silesia. Of course, the Franco-Polish operational plan was based on the premise of a strong Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia and France and Poland should be linked together and should attack Germany at the same time, and the Polish army would meet in Silesia.

Current Strategy

This plan, once Czechoslovakia was divided, was equivalent to waste paper and had to be quickly revised. What is regrettable is that Poland was also an active participant in the division of Czechoslovakia. The revised Franco-Polish new plan probably stipulates that Poland will adopt a defensive stance, preserve its strength, avoid major battles, and if necessary, temporarily abandon land, and not "put all its eggs in one basket." As it looks now, Germany's strategy is to send troops in three routes, taking the form of pincers, to control Poland's fate: the first is to take the line of Borongburg, Pinglau, and Tingzi in the north to cut off the "Corridor"; the second is to attack Schnaittmühle and Lower Silesia at the same time to attack the back of Posen; and the third is to invade Cieszyn and "drive straight in" along the foothills of the Tatra Mountains to surround Upper Silesia. In other words, Germany's goal is to complete three "small but complete" battles of Tannenberg in one fell swoop, and to scatter the Polish army's detachments, so that they cannot meet with its main force.

It seems that Poland will probably have to retreat to the old German-Russian border (that is, the area between the cities of Warsaw, Lodz, Kielce, and Radom) before it will mount a major resistance. Originally, in the north of this area, Poland had built strong Modlin forts; the famous Polish military railway, the Krakow-Warsaw line, also runs through it; for many years, Poland's efforts to operate the military industry have also been concentrated here; and the local residents are almost entirely Polish: therefore, this area is indeed the heartland of Poland. In 1920, the Soviet army invaded Poland and was completely defeated in the Battle of Warsaw, which can prove this. However, the Soviet army's invasion from the east was difficult due to the terrain, and they suffered a lot. On the other hand, the German army's arrival from the west was relatively easy. In order to make up for the geographical shortcomings, Poland must have completed large-scale defense projects long ago to resist.

Poland's Internal Situation

Poland boasts that with the outbreak of the European War, it has mobilized 1.5 million people, and its mobilizable force is more than that. However, although Poland is a Western country with a population of 35 million, which is not much different from France, its war power must be discounted. One reason is that true Poles only account for about two-thirds of the total population. In addition, Ukrainians account for 4.5 million, Jews 2.4 million, Belarusians 1.2 million, and Germans 1 million. These ethnic minorities have a strong hatred for Poland, and the number of them in the Polish army is very limited. Now, the Jews are certainly willing to fight for Poland, but it is impossible for Germans or Slovaks to work hard. Another reason is that Poland's finances are in deficit, and even the army organized by true Poles does not have the financial resources to train them thoroughly. For many years, it has only been able to train about half of the pure Polish army, and recently it has only been able to train two-thirds. Because of the lack of financial resources, the collection and preparation of military supplies are also greatly hindered, especially the rapid development of mechanized postal teams. Therefore, the military equipment is obviously not as perfect as that of Sui. The combat effectiveness of the Polish army at all levels varies greatly. The infantry, cavalry, and artillery, of course, have some elite troops that can compete with Germany, but there are also many that are very weak. The Polish air force has shown a high level in peacetime, and the pilots are brave and skilled, and are also praised by European countries.

In terms of the supply of military supplies, Poland has been prepared for a long time. Even if Upper Silesia is forced to be abandoned, it can still manufacture most of the military materials in the interior. However, it is inevitable that it will feel difficult to import munitions from foreign countries. Since the Soviet Union has concluded a non-aggression treaty with Germany, it will naturally not transport munitions to Poland, or allow other countries to transport munitions to Poland through its territory. Since the Baltic Sea is under the control of the German navy, even if the two neutral countries of Latvia and Lithuania are willing to risk smuggling, there is no way to fly across. The German army occupied Slovakia, and all the transportation between the Danube River basin and Poland was cut off. Therefore, the only remaining route is the Black Sea and Romania. Romania's attitude has been ambiguous to this day. Originally, her and Poland's cooperation was aimed at preventing the Soviet Union from invading any of them. Now that the invading country is Germany rather than the Soviet Union, she has no obligation to assist Poland. However, Romania is also an ally of France, and whether she should assist Poland is worth King Carol's careful and agile consideration.

Corner of the Battlefield

### Wuhu Under Occupation

— Hua

In Wuhu, you have to salute when you meet the Japanese - but you can't put your feet together and stick your hands to your legs. If you are too disciplined, they will say you are a Chinese soldier; if you pretend to be a bumpkin who both bows and clasps his hands, the Japanese soldiers may pat you on the shoulder and say: "Good citizen, good citizen," and let you pass.

The inspection is quite strict. Naturally, when you are in Xiongcheng (referring to being among Chinese countrymen), you have to prepare in advance, either dress up as a merchant or a farmer. It would be even better if you could speak the dialect of Anhui. After inspecting your tracks, the Japanese soldiers will definitely ask: "Are there any Chinese soldiers?" "Are there any New Fourth Army soldiers?" You shake your head and wave your hands and say: "I don't know, there aren't any where we live." Or deliberately say, "Many, many," "Big, big," these irrelevant words. Sometimes, the owner of the inn will also add: "He's a bumpkin, what does he know?" And you will pass. In short, as long as you deal with it properly, it doesn't matter. Especially now that the Japanese are adopting a "pacification policy," full of benevolence and morality, bumpkins are particularly easy to be deceived. But according to the Japanese's own estimates, there are about two thousand Chinese "plainclothes detectives" secretly active in Wuhu City, which makes the Japanese uneasy day and night. The Nanjing Municipal Special Service Agency has also set up a "Wuhu Class" here, which is said to be training staff for the puppet organization on the surface, but in reality it is dealing with Chinese "plainclothes detectives."

The most prosperous streets in Wuhu are Zhongshan Road and Changjie area. However, the so-called "prosperity" is only that there are many people, but there are no big stores. Apart from the foreign firms and associations opened by the Japanese, the most are small stalls set up by refugees. Under the heavy taxes and exploitation, they sell Japanese goods for the Japanese, but business is also very sluggish.

Mid-range or higher-end hotels such as "Dahua" and "Zhongnan"...etc., are all gambling dens and brothels. There are even publicly advertised brothels in the newspapers to attract customers.

In addition to training prostitute detectives, the Japanese also pulled monks and nuns out of the "Buddhist struggle" and into the "secular world," using them as pawns at a very low price.

The puppet county magistrate of Wuhu used to be Zhu, who was very attentive to his masters. Now he has been promoted to the provincial committee. It is said that he will soon be the puppet governor of the "Jiangnan Province" — the area around Nanjing and Wuhu has been designated by the Japanese as "Jiangnan Province." The current county magistrate of Wuhu, Wang, is a "former Qing Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations)." Every time he goes out, there is a large number of Japanese military police "protecting" him, but in fact they are monitoring him. Therefore, these traitors are not only afraid of the Chinese army, but also afraid of their own masters.

In order to "prosper" the market and beautify peace, the Japanese have restored several theaters, such as the "Foguang" and "Guangming" theaters, which show movies, and the films are anesthetics such as "The King of Beasts." There are also the "Huayuan Grand Stage" and the "Fuxing Grand Stage," which specialize in performing operas. The advertisements at the entrance of the theater and in the newspapers are full of words such as: "Half price for the Imperial Army" or "Imperial Army preferential treatment" or "Welcome the Imperial Army to take a seat."

There are several streets where pedestrians are prohibited from passing, which are the locations of the Japanese barracks and wounded soldier hospitals. Their wounded soldiers cannot run around casually. The first reason is that they are afraid that the unwounded Japanese soldiers will be scared when they see them; the second reason is that they are afraid that the Chinese will find out the exact number of wounded soldiers; and the third reason is that they are afraid that the wounded soldiers will reveal military secrets.

On April 4, the Japanese army transferred two hundred and several dozen "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" members to "Nangong" for training, but they all escaped on the way, leaving not a single one behind. Although there is a so-called "linked security system," it is useless at that time. So many people ran away, and a large number of them were killed. Isn't the result of the Japanese's "pacification policy" a big joke?

### Explanation of Remittance and Transfer

— Wang Fengren

Clearing and Remittance

Before the war, commercial papers circulating in Shanghai were divided into two types: clearing and remittance. All papers that were not stamped with the "remittance" stamp were clearing papers; the holder of this type of paper could cash it at the bank on the due date. Remittance papers were stamped with the word "remittance" and could only be paid to the bank or money shop for collection on the same day; if you wanted to withdraw cash, you had to wait one more day. In other words, the cash could only be collected on the day after the due date of the paper.

The emergence of remittance papers in Shanghai originated in the late Qing Dynasty. Initially, it was only popular in the money industry. Therefore, the papers issued by money shops, such as checks, money shop notes, and drafts, were all remittance papers. The settlement of these papers between the same industry was handled by the Remittance Clearing House, without the need to settle in cash. This method was very convenient after it was promoted by the money industry. Other Chinese commercial banks also successively accepted remittance papers, but the clearing was initially entrusted to the money industry. After the establishment of the Bank Paper Exchange in January 1933, it was moved to the exchange for processing.

When the "August 13th" Incident occurred in 1937, in order to stabilize the financial situation, the Ministry of Finance restricted the withdrawal of deposits; however, the market's chips were excessively contracted. In order to meet the legitimate needs of industry and commerce, remittance was promoted to help and rescue. However, since then, this type of paper was only allowed to be transferred between the same industry in Shanghai, and no legal tender was paid, nor could it be used to purchase foreign exchange. Since then, the method of taking cash on the next day, which had been in effect for more than 30 years, was invisibly suspended, and the nature of remittance has greatly changed.

Remittance Discount Rate

Since the implementation of this remittance system, those who held remittance and urgently needed cash had to automatically adjust the price to realize cash, and remittance discount was thus generated. When remittance discount first occurred, each thousand yuan only discounted six or seven yuan. However, since the government controlled foreign geese in March 1938 and a black market was created in Shanghai, those who held remittance deposits did not hesitate to pay a high price to exchange for legal tender in order to transfer to foreign exchange; therefore, the discount rate gradually increased. By June of the same year, it reached a peak of 79 yuan per thousand yuan. Later, the Bank Association Preparation Committee, entrusted by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, came forward to maintain and participate in the buying and selling of remittance, and the discount rate was stabilized at about 50 yuan per thousand yuan. After the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram re-restricted deposits and withdrawals on June 22 of this year, the three banks no longer maintained the remittance discount rate, and it once again soared, approaching the 300 yuan mark. Later, it gradually fell back and hovered within the 200 yuan mark.

New Remittance System

Affected by the Ma telegram's restriction on deposits and withdrawals and the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, the market felt an extreme shortage of chips. The Shanghai banking industry had to kill the law to rescue, and thus the "new remittance system" was created.

The so-called "new remittance system" means that the balance of remittance reserves originally deposited in the reserve vault by each bank and shop will be converted into legal tender at 95% off across the board and exchanged evenly over twelve weeks. And the Bank Joint Reserve Committee will receive the assets provided by each bank and shop, and provide new remittance at 70% of the assessed value, with the total amount of issuance temporarily set at 50 million yuan. The mutual receipt and delivery of papers between the banking industry will also be handled solely by the Bank Joint Reserve Committee.

The nature of this new remittance is completely the same as the old remittance from the perspective of the bank's depositors, and the price in the market is also the same. There is no distinction between new and old at first. However, the reformed remittance system has a more rigorous organization and more sufficient preparation.

### The Maginot Line

— Yi Ju

Once the European war breaks out, this world-famous defense line will undoubtedly exert its greatest power. This defense line runs along the east of France, and the construction is 600 miles long. Almost every half mile there is a fort, and every mile there is a bunker. It can be said that it is impeccable and has no gaps to take advantage of. And underneath there are also military facilities. The strictness of its layout, as shown in the table, is of course just a brief overview. As for all the confidential information inside, it is not disclosed to outsiders, and we have no way of knowing.

Modern Figures

### Molotov

Molotov, the People's Commissar and Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, was born in 1890 in a small village in the Vatka province of Russia. His father's original surname was Scriabin, and he was a minor official. He hoped that his son would be able to enter university in the future and achieve something, so that his life would be happy. However, this placed a heavy burden on Molotov's family, leaving them deeply in debt. Molotov knew that his family was in debt for his sake, and he studied extremely hard. Molotov had extremely strong judgment, an excellent memory, and was able to concentrate and work for hours without fatigue.

When he was about to graduate from university, he accidentally obtained a propaganda document from a group promoting contemporary knowledge revolution. He then participated in secret gatherings, believed in the ideology, and secretly stole all prohibited publications. In November 1906, he established close ties with the leaders of this movement.

In order to participate in the revolution, Molotov disregarded his father's expectations. At the same time, he abandoned his father's surname, Scriabin, and changed his surname to Molotov to engage in revolutionary activities against the Tsar. In 1909, he was discovered by the police for the first time and imprisoned. However, because he was very young, only nineteen years old, the judge dealt with him leniently and released him immediately. After his release, he returned home for a short period, and then returned to St. Petersburg, the capital of Russia at that time, to engage in research work and work for the Bolshevik Party. He helped to print the secret publications Pravda and "Zvezda."

In 1911, he entered the 工藝學校, but was tracked by the police and soon forced to leave the school. In 1912, he was arrested for the second time but eventually escaped. In 191_ (likely a typo, should be 191_), he was arrested again and exiled to Siberia, forced to do hard labor in the Irkutsk mine for several months. One night, taking advantage of the guards' inattention, he escaped again and went abroad to London, England, to live with his friend Stalin. He met Lenin for the first time at this time. Soon after, he returned to Russia from England with Stalin to prepare for the revolutionary movement.

In 1917, he arrived in Russia, at which time he was only twenty-seven years old. Soon after, Kerensky overthrew the Tsarist government and seized power. When Lenin was expelled by Kerensky, he was once a cadre of the party. When Lenin was in power, he remained in an unimportant position. After Stalin came to power, his influence rose again, and he became the second secretary of the party.

For eighteen years, he worked closely with Stalin. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, everyone knew that he was "Stalin's shadow." In 1930, he was elected as the People's Commissar of the Soviet Union. This year, when he was forty-nine years old, he also served as the Foreign Affairs Commissar.

Molotov does not like to talk much, but he is very kind to people. His attitude also carries some of the elegance of English and American gentlemen. This is probably due to the influence of his wife, Kapovskaya, who is the most beautiful woman in Moscow and also a capable woman in the Soviet Union.

Molotov's wife once worked in a Soviet cosmetics factory for a period of time, and soon rose to be the director of the factory. In 1936, she went to the United States to study manufacturing methods. After returning to China, she immediately used American machines to manufacture cosmetics. Her famous slogan was: "Cosmetics are not a luxury, but a necessity," which has attracted the attention of people all over the world. She currently manages seventeen factories in the Soviet Union.

Molotov's wife is also an important political figure. On November 14, 1937, she was elected as the Deputy Chairman of the People's Food Supply Committee. On January 20 of this year, she was also appointed as the Chairman of the Fisheries Committee.

Therefore, some people believe that the Molotov couple are extremely important figures in the Soviet Union, and hope that they will replace Stalin as the head of the Soviet Union in the future.

Women and Family

### Experiences in Managing a Home

—Mrs. Lin Yutang—

There are really no so-called experiences in household affairs. I respectfully offer four very common points for the attention of our women:

(1) I advocate open family finances. Large families often cheat in economics and accumulate savings privately, which results in all kinds of tragedies.

(2) Budget and finalize accounts in advance. Expenditures should not exceed the budget, so that the family affairs will not be disordered.

(3) Cultivate the habit of autonomy in children from an early age, without relying on servants, and develop their individuality. Do not use force to force them. If children make mistakes, use facial expressions to make them realize it. Do not scold them often, as too much scolding will lose its effectiveness. Sometimes you can use other people's affairs to teach them indirectly.

(4) Kitchen autonomy. Previously, we both studied abroad in Germany for many years. Cooking and laundry were completely self-managed. Although we now hire servants to do it for us, I must take a supervisory attitude at every meal, because family hygiene focuses on diet first. If it is entrusted to others, it will not be reliable in the end.

I agree with the small family system, because it is economically independent, does not rely on others, does not shirk responsibility, can develop the ability of the housewife, and there is no possibility of conflict between old and new opinions. These are beyond the reach of large families. However, it is one's duty to support one's parents, and one must not neglect it. I believe that regardless of whether the family is new, old, large, or small, the housewife cannot shirk the natural duty of managing the family, cannot overdo the entertainment, cannot wear strange and flamboyant clothes that do not fit her status, and cannot neglect the education of men and women. In addition to family affairs, she must not forget the desire to seek knowledge and the cause of social welfare.

### Random Talk about Heredity

—Ding Fubao

All human beings have heredity. However, the word heredity is quite difficult to explain. Recently, some people have revised and tampered with Zhao Songxue's song about clay figures (said to be given to Madam Guan) and explained the way of heredity in the most thorough way. The lyrics say: "We two are so affectionate. It's like taking two pieces of clay, pinching one of you, and sculpting one of me. Suddenly, we are happy, and we break a corner of me and you. We start over again, knead and rub again, and add a small baby. In that, the whole body of the small baby has you and me. If it is pinched well, it is like me and you. If it is not pinched well, I will blame you, and you will blame me." This says that the small baby is made by the whole body of the husband and wife. Therefore, the skin color of the small baby, the color of the hair, the beauty or ugliness of the appearance, the length of the bones, and the excellence or shortcomings of the spirit, etc., are all inherited from the parents. The analogy is the most accurate. Do not neglect it because it is a humorous word. In modern times, social interaction is open. When men and women are engaged, they only rely on temporary emotions, but they do not know the truth of heredity. Often, the small one involves a family, and the big one harms the society. Young men and women mostly do not know it in their dreams. Let's verify it with the facts of heredity.

Mr. Goddard of the United States once investigated the family history of children in a school for the mentally retarded. From a girl, he traced back to the ancestors four or five generations ago and found out the family system of a large team of people. The ancestor of this girl was named Martin, Carregak. During the American Revolutionary War, he joined the army and made great achievements. In his youth, he accidentally fell in love with a teahouse daughter, had a relationship, and gave birth to a boy. This teahouse daughter was originally a mentally retarded woman. The boy she gave birth to left behind a bad family system. The sons and grandsons left behind by this boy have gone through five generations, no less than 480 people. Among them, there are 143 mentally retarded people, 36 illegitimate children, 33 prostitutes, 24 alcoholics, 18 engaged in lowly occupations, 3 criminals, 3 epileptics, 83 who died young, and 291 whose whereabouts are unknown. Only 46 people can stand in society. Later, Mr. Carregak married an ordinary woman, and the sons and grandsons she gave birth to are ordinary good families.

Now let's talk about an excellent family system to make a comparison with the above-mentioned bad family system. Jonathan Edwards of the United States was a great educator in the United States. Or investigate his family system, with a total of 1,394 descendants. Among them, 13 have served as department heads of various departments of universities, 65 have served as university professors, 60 are writers, 100 are lawyers, 60 are doctors, more than 100 are pastors and theologians, and 70 have served as officers in the navy and army. It can be said that the family is full of talents. Darwin, who is famous in the world for his theory of evolution, and Gordon, the founder of eugenics, are cousins. Their family has also produced famous scientists for generations, which is known to the world. The Mitsukuri family of Japan is also full of talents and is called an excellent family system. From this, we know that there are bad family systems and excellent family systems in the world. The reason for these two kinds of family systems is heredity, which goes without saying. Therefore, when young people are engaged, they should conduct a detailed investigation of each other's family system to avoid future troubles.

### A Formula Ideal Marriage Age

— Guan Zhou

At what age is the "joy of marriage" most appropriate? According to the ancient Chinese custom, men marry at the age of thirty and women marry at the age of twenty. Is this ideal? According to the opinion of a famous professor at the University of San Francisco in the United States, this question can be answered by a mathematical formula, and the formula is also very simple: husband's age / 2 + 7 = wife's age. In ordinary language, it means that when getting married, the bride's age should be equal to the groom's age divided by two plus seven. For example, if the groom is twenty-eight years old, the ideal bride is twenty-one years old; a thirty-six-year-old man must marry a twenty-five-year-old woman; if the groom is a centenarian, then his spouse should be fifty-seven years old.

Strange News

### Snake Anecdotes Canned Snake Meat and Poisonous Snake Race

Snakes have always been considered poisonous things, but now canned snake meat is a very popular food. The patent right for this food belongs to George Kenasan Di of Tampa, Florida. Speaking of his motivation for making canned snake meat, it is very interesting:

Andy was originally a farmer. One day, his two sons killed a big snake. Andy peeled it and cooked it. After eating it, he felt that the taste was exceptionally delicious. Later, they often cooked snakes as a side dish. One day, a team of troops happened to be stationed in Tampa. Andy cooked snake meat to entertain them and was very popular. From then on, Andy decided to do this business.

Their factory is also large in scale, and can ship 10,000 cans a year. There are as many as twelve people who catch snakes alone. There is no lack of raw materials. They can be found everywhere in the grassland ponds. Their business has now been around for six years. In addition to canned snake meat, there are also snake oil and snake skins that can be used to make clothes and shoes.

Every September, New Mexico in the United States holds a poisonous snake competition. The arena is a very large circular open space with a small hole in the center. The arena is surrounded by wire mesh, and outside the mesh is the place where the audience stands. During the competition, first put two hundred and fifty poisonous snakes that have been hungry for a few days into a large basket, carry it to the center of the arena, and then fire a gun to knock off the bottom of the basket, allowing the poisonous snakes to crawl out and fight fiercely with each other. Whoever can drill into the small hole in the center of the arena first will be considered the winner. This is an extremely dangerous competition and also the most peculiar of all competitions. Therefore, every year when the meeting is held, many people will travel thousands of miles to New Mexico to see this new novelty.

### Strange Weddings in the Malay Peninsula

In the Malay Peninsula, when men and women are seventeen or eighteen years old, their parents will carry out a sales-style marriage for them, buying women based on the amount of money. There are even those who exchange wives among friends.

On the day of the wedding, they usually invite many relatives and friends to drink and dance in the courtyard, and especially put the bride and groom in a room and close the door. They will not be released until three days later to greet the guests.

Even stranger, they exchange a wife for a cow or a pair of sheep. If the cow or sheep dies, that is the day the couple divorces.

### No Old Maids in Siam

Any Siamese woman who is over thirty years old and has not yet married can ask the government to choose a spouse for her. Recently, it has been stipulated by law that the government has an unavoidable duty. However, the government does not feel troubled by this. Originally, there were many unmarried male criminals. The government can order them to be prospective husbands without their consent. If they disobey, they will be severely punished. However, those who have committed lighter crimes can choose the spouse they think is suitable. According to the Siamese police authorities, old maids are most likely to be jealous and good at disciplining their husbands; and unmarried criminals are often undisciplined, and without a "henpecked husband" in the family, they are not enough to deter them.

### Small Records

A grasshopper one inch long can jump up and travel to a location more than seventy times, or even one hundred and fifty times, its own length.

The legs of an ordinary flea are only one-twentieth of an inch long, but with just a light jump, it can reach seven feet high. If a well-trained athlete with legs three feet long wants to equal its record, then he must have the ability to jump over a 500-foot-high building.

Age is mostly calculated from the date of birth, but in ancient times, Greek women calculated it from the date of marriage.

The wings of flies beat 18,900 times per minute.

When the temperature is 100 degrees, the speed of ants' walking is twelve times faster than when the temperature is 50 degrees.

The tallest tree in the world is the redwood tree in California, USA. Starting from the ground, its height is 364 feet.

In Japan, 18 million people depend on silkworm farming for a living.

The largest animal in the world is the blue whale. It is said that the blue whale is already 24 feet long when it is first born.

If the salt contained in all the oceans of the world were solidified into a solid block, its volume would be 4.8 million cubic feet.

Each country has a certain national flower: such as plum blossom in China, rose in England, iris (or lily) in France, cornflower in Germany, daisy in Italy, cherry blossom in Japan, poppy in India, citrus in Spain, cactus in Mexico, and sugar maple in Canada.

Envelopes were first used in Europe and America in 1839. Sir Hill of England began to use two-cent stamps to deliver letters in 1840.

The 1.24 million miles of railways in the world can circle the equator more than thirty-one weeks.

### Liuzhou Folk Songs

Guangxi, especially the current Guangxi, is so admirable!

Guilin in Guangxi is known as "the landscape is the best in the world," while Liuzhou, in addition to natural scenery, also produces many wonderful popular literatures. Below are a few extremely lovely Liuzhou folk songs, which are very easy to sing even for people from other places.

(1) The swallow flies high and flies low, landing on its feet and carrying mud in its mouth. We two have talked about it first, don't separate when we are poor and in trouble.

(2) A plum blossom in the middle of the sea, the roots are stable and not afraid of being pushed by the water. We two have talked about it first, don't be afraid of others gossiping.

(3) A vine on a high mountain and ridge, the vine blooms with nineteen layers. You can look at the flowers as much as you want, but you must not pick the flowers.

(4) The big pond has been dry for eighteen years, the lotus leaves are rotten and the lotus roots are also sweet, the knife cuts the lotus roots but the silk does not break, and the same heart changes its mind in the coming year.

### Maxims of Cultivation

Dealing with difficult things is like organizing a tangled mess. The more anxious you are, the harder it is to find a clue. As long as you are patient and restrain your temper, you will not be hindered by difficulties and you will be able to overcome them.

A "diploma" is just a magic waste, and "real learning" is a weapon with divine power.

"Hope" is the bright lamp that guides the dark and boundless journey of life. Proper hope can increase the true interest of life; however, hope is not something that can be produced out of thin air and without any emotion. Therefore, the "stimulus" that creates hope has also become an element of life.

When a person stands in society, he must have perseverance in whatever he does. He works hard day and night for decades, burying his head in hard work, not afraid of failure, enduring hardship and resentment, and not losing heart. The result will be a satisfactory harvest.
