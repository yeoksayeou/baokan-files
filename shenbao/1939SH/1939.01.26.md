The Japanese are Already in a Situation of Inevitable Defeat

(Chongqing) The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee convened. President Chiang delivered an opening address with the main title: Opening Address of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee, and the subtitle: Using Facts to Prove the Enemy Country is Bound to Fail and Our Country is Bound to Win. The content outline is: (1) The tasks of this Plenary Session and the spirit of perseverance and thoroughness that our war of resistance and revolution should have; (2) Our most important task at present is to understand the purpose of the war of resistance and the situation of the enemy and ourselves, and to firmly establish resolve and confidence; (3) The enemy country has reasons for inevitable defeat, including the following examples: 1. Violating its established steps of its continental policy; 2. Its attempts of "subjugating without fighting," "quick war and quick victory," and "quick peace and quick conclusion" all fail to succeed; 3. Strategic failures are due to (1) ignorance of oneself and the enemy, (2) solely seeking cunning and luck, violating the principle of "clumsy speed," (3) prolonged stationing of troops, falling into a predicament; (4) Political failures, including: 1. creating puppets, using traitors, deepening the corruption of soldiers; 2. diplomatic policies are fragmented and contradictory, becoming increasingly isolated and dangerous; (5) not understanding Chinese history and national strength, and not understanding the present era and the characteristics of the development of the Chinese revolution; (4) The enemy's inevitable defeat is our inevitable victory... We should strengthen our spiritual power, persevere in the war of resistance, fully fight to the end, and never compromise or surrender midway; (5) From our own country's self-examination, in terms of history, geography, culture, national spirit, and economy, there is a foundation that makes the enemy inevitably unable to win; (6) The direction of the development of the international situation must tend towards safeguarding good faith and peace, and the democratic countries are also strengthening their preparations and determination to curb aggression. We should follow this path of public reason and justice to implement the national policy of resisting to the end; (7) China's war of resistance is a war of sorrow and a war of righteousness, seeking to contribute to East Asia and the world. Since ancient times, a sorrowful army has always won, and a righteous war has always succeeded; (8) Understanding oneself, understanding the enemy, understanding the environment, and the inevitability of the development of things, one can clearly understand the numbers of success or failure, victory or defeat; (9) In the future, we must start from scratch without any reliance, and work hard against the enemy's situation; (1) use our unity to deal with the enemy's arrogance and disorder, achieving superiority from below; (2) give play to the characteristics of our agricultural country, persisting in frugality, deepening the weaknesses of the enemy's industrial country; (3) make use of our country's advantages in timing and location, step up all wartime construction, and promote a crisis of social collapse in the enemy country; (4) truly practice the Three People's Principles and overthrow the enemy's militarism; (10) We must clearly recognize the revolutionary responsibility of the Party and ourselves, establish an oath to be responsible, fulfill our duties, and strive to the end, working together quickly, hard, diligently, and practically to win the victory of the war of resistance and complete the great cause of the revolution. The full text of the opening address is as follows:

Comrades, this plenary session is held at the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, which is of great significance and the task is particularly arduous. I have repeatedly pointed out recently that our War of Resistance should be divided into two major stages. The first phase was before the fall of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan; the second phase is after the retreat from Wuhan. The task of the first phase was to consume the enemy's strength as much as possible, to cover our rear preparations, to establish the foundation for a protracted war, and to complete all strategic and political arrangements for our second phase of the War of Resistance. The task of the second phase is to take over the achievements of the previous struggle, implement all the plans arranged in the first phase, and give play to the power of our War of Resistance to achieve the goal of victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction. Therefore, this plenary session is a major key for us to turn defense into offense, turn recovery into victory, and determine prosperity or decline, survival or death with our efforts. Facing this major key of survival or death, prosperity or decline, the comrades present should review the facts of the past, determine the plans for the future, and increase the courage to fight, with the spirit of starting from scratch, to carry through to the end in a down-to-earth manner. Recently, the situation of the War of Resistance, on the one hand, our military and popular morale are stronger than before, and the internal and external situation is also becoming more and more favorable. The people of the whole country believe that the danger to our country has passed, and they are very optimistic about the future of the country, and the psychology of inevitable victory is even stronger. However, the mission of our Party is becoming increasingly arduous. Therefore, all comrades must be more concerned about the future of the Party and the country, and study whether there are better strategies and plans. In my opinion, the spirit of our revolutionary party is only a question of whether we ourselves do it or not, that is, whether we ourselves are revolutionary or not. In other words, it is whether we resist the war or not. If we can do it and can resist to the end, then we are not afraid of not having a plan, and we are not afraid of not having a way. We must know that the real way of our revolution is (to use clumsiness to overcome skill) and (to use the few to overcome the many), and to move forward based on our Three People's Principles. If we can sacrifice and fight with the same spirit as in the first phase of the War of Resistance, and can go further and do it in a pragmatic way, then victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction will be without doubt. If not, either knowing but not acting, or acting but not exerting effort, or making temporary efforts but not being able to persist, or starting positively but becoming negative halfway, or only talking about form and not seeking reality, or having only aspirations but no concrete plans for implementation, or having plans but not being able to execute them bravely, then the favorable opportunities will be easily missed, and the improved situation will not help the facts. Therefore, the root of all success or failure, prosperity or decline lies in whether we have a revolutionary spirit and whether we have the confidence and determination to achieve our goals. Only with this determination can we formulate effective plans based on our determination. Only with firm confidence in revolution, national salvation, and the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance can we not be afraid of difficulties or dangers and earnestly implement the established plans to achieve success. Therefore, I ask our comrades, the first thing is to establish determination and confidence. Where do determination and confidence come from? It is to have a correct understanding of our goals of the War of Resistance and the situation of the War of Resistance. Only with a correct understanding will the determination not be defeated, and the courage of blood and energy can persist and fight to the end without slackening. Only with a correct understanding will our confidence be a confidence based on solid grounds, and we can be steadfast and unyielding. Why do we want to resist the war? It is because we demand the survival and freedom of the nation and the nation, and we want to follow the Three People's Principles to carry out revolution and save the country. But the enemy fundamentally does not allow us to survive, let alone allow us to be free. If we cannot resist the war at this time and fantasize about compromise midway, it will be abandoning halfway. In this way, our nation will be completely destroyed, and our descendants will forever be slaves and beasts, and will never recover. If we cannot resist to the end, our country will be reduced to a subordinate country and colony of the enemy country, and from then on, international justice will be fundamentally overturned, and world peace will never be guaranteed. The ambition of our Prime Minister's lifelong advocacy of revolution, national salvation, and saving the world will all be in vain. Since the enemy government and its Prime Minister Konoe successively issued statements, his conspiracy to annex China to dominate the Pacific and invade the whole world has been known to the world and need not be said again. What I want to make clear to all comrades now is that the enemy country has already failed, and there are various reasons to prove that it will eventually suffer the greatest failure. As long as we fight on, we are sure to have victory. First, in terms of the enemy, not to mention that in the past eighteen months, he has killed or wounded more than 700,000 officers and soldiers on the north and south battlefields of China, and consumed 900 million war expenses, so that his country is exhausted, agriculture and industry are stagnant, society is decadent, and political unrest is brewing. These are all tangible signs. From the time he launched the invasion to the present, all strategic and political operations, as well as his observations and predictions of China and his understanding of the times, have violated principles and fallen into mistakes everywhere. At this time of success or failure, profit or loss, survival or destruction, I want to list the examples of the enemy's inevitable failure for the plenary session based on true facts, and submit a detailed analysis report to all comrades. First, everyone knows that the enemy's determination to launch the invasion is to implement his continental policy. The so-called continental policy, according to their internal secret traditional policy and their public Tanaka Memorial, is to first occupy Manchuria and Mongolia, and then try to invade the entire territory of China, and even dominate Asia and unify the world. But when he had not yet stabilized the occupation of the Northeast, he wanted to invade North China. After his power reached North China, he changed from chronic erosion to acute annexation. Therefore, he openly occupied our Tianjin and this has completely deviated from his so-called established national policy and strategy of the continental policy. Not only that, he also wanted to advance to Central China, and even invade South China and occupy our Guangzhou. This is his further step to destroy their traditional policy. After he entered Central China and South China, not only did he fall into a situation where he could not advance or retreat strategically, but also politically, he was forced to go against the trend and make enemies with the world's powers, falling into a situation of being besieged on all sides. This is his first way of inevitable defeat. Second, his initial attempt on China was to subdue us without fighting, but we finally fought without surrendering, which was beyond his expectations. After the war, he wanted a quick war and quick victory, but from Nankou, Songhu, Xinkou, Nanjing, all the way to the Battle of Southern Shandong and the battles on the edge of Poyang Lake and the Dabie Mountains, he went deeper step by step, and finally could not achieve a quick war and quick victory. Therefore, he turned around and longed for a quick peace and a quick conclusion. Before we withdrew from Wuhan, his magazines and newspapers tried their best to advocate stopping the war or finding a way to stop the war, and on the one hand, he used various cunning schemes to try to lure us into the trap, deceive the world, and seek cheap advantages. But soon he showed his true colors and took out his so-called "Asia Prosperity Agency" and "East Asia Cooperation System" two very poisonous plans. Now, not only the people of the whole country have seen through his conspiracy, but the world has also seen his ambition. This plan of his has clearly failed again. This is his second strategic failure. Third, from a strategic point of view, he not only violated three military principles, but also committed three major taboos in military affairs: ignorance of oneself and ignorance of the enemy. He never dreamed that our country would resist for as long as eighteen months. Not only would it not be subdued, but it would become stronger and stronger. He also did not know that his own military strength, after being used to a certain extent, would be exhausted to the point where he would use five people to fight one of us. "In the Second War Zone, there is a statistic that for every one of our deaths, the enemy army will die 14 and a half people." He tried to seek cunning and luck, vainly trying to win with skill, but the result was the opposite, completely violating Sun Tzu's principle of "soldiers value clumsy speed," leading to repeated political tides and a growing anti-war atmosphere. Konoe Fumimaro, whom they boasted as the only wartime cabinet, had to step down because of this, which also confirmed Sun Tzu's famous saying that "a long war is not beneficial to the country." The ancient people said that the great taboo of "stopping troops from going deep" was originally said to the strong. Now he has gone from the edge of the East China Sea to thousands of miles away in the interior of our country, making the areas he has occupied become the sphere of influence where our regular army and guerrillas are active, subject to our control everywhere, and constantly attacked by us. If you want to advance, you will get deeper and deeper, and if you want to retreat, there are thorns everywhere. This is truly doing what Sun Tzu said, "blunt the army, frustrate their sharpness, weaken their strength, and exhaust their wealth," and has stepped into the crisis of "the princes taking advantage of their disadvantages." In short, in the current situation, the enemy has indeed fallen into the situation of "hanging shape" as Sun Tzu called it. It is really the so-called that it is neither on the top nor on the bottom. It has reached the point where "it is difficult to return without winning and unfavorable." This is his most obvious strategic failure. Fourth, in terms of political strategy, he can only win over some incomplete and infamous traitors to be puppets, and use hooligans and bandits as pawns. On the one hand, he deepens the corruption of his soldiers, and on the other hand, he exposes his various sins and stupidity for the ridicule of the world. Moreover, he is arrogant and wants to use his culture, which he pieced together and imitated, to annex our long-standing independent culture, and use military and political aggression to plunder our economy. As a result, not only did he get nowhere, but he deepened the phenomenon of superiority from below in his country. As for diplomacy, he originally attempted to ease relations with Soviet Russia, but the result was only self-deprecating. He vainly tried to court the United States, but it aroused its aversion. He intended to break up the front line of Britain, France, and the United States, but the result was the opposite, step by step, contradictory everywhere. This is the so-called fundamentally wrong, and the branches and leaves are useless. Fifth, when it comes to his understanding of China, he does not recognize the strong potential resistance of our Chinese nation since ancient times, nor does he recognize that the present era is an era in which nationalism is developed and irresistible, nor does he recognize the truth of our Chinese history. He regards himself as Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing, and finally thinks that the Chinese nation is easy to deceive and destroy and there is no problem, but he does not know that the main reason for the defeat of Song and Ming was that in those years, very few people in the court did not understand the enemy's situation, did not distinguish between advantages and disadvantages, and were threatened by the enemy in spirit, and were finally deceived and surrendered by the enemy, which was not the destruction of our entire nation. Now the enemy vainly wants to realize the dream of controlling our country in the short term under the slogan of "establishing a new order in East Asia." He did not think that it took him more than forty years to invade our Northeast, used a lot of troops, and spent a lot of money, and he still cannot control our Northeast, let alone rule it. He still does not realize the lesson of this immediate fact. Instead, he wants to intensify his efforts, annex the whole of China, and follow the same path of recent failure. This is because he fundamentally does not recognize our Chinese nation, does not recognize the power of our Three People's Principles, does not recognize the characteristics of our National Government, and does not recognize today's era, as well as today's revolutionary strategy and revolutionary tactics in China. Frankly speaking,

Editorial

### What is the Basis for Japan's Long-Term War?

Recently, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, in response to questions from various members of the House of Representatives regarding his policy toward China, stated that Japan would never change its established policy toward China, and that even if a third party were to impose economic pressure on Japan, Japan had already made arrangements to resist it. The reason why the Japanese House of Representatives raised questions about the policy toward China was to express the Japanese people's concern and disappointment with the war of aggression against China, but Hiranuma's response still showed that the Japanese fascist military阀 was determined to go its own way.

Japan, as a small island country, together with its mainland Korea, Taiwan, and South Sakhalin, has only 670,000 square kilometers of land and more than 97 million people, and its agricultural products and mineral resources are extremely scarce. For her to maintain a ten-year war against China, or even a hundred-year war, or even to fight against a third country at all costs, is really like barking in a dream. In the past 19 months of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has already shown signs of being unable to continue to support its manpower. Recently, the new troops sent to China are mostly young soldiers with poor eyesight, and there are many fascist European comrades mixed in with the various mechanized units. As for the recent news that the Japanese military plans to extend the service life of the Navy and Army in China, and the recent active recruitment of Chinese gangsters and bandits to implement a policy of using Chinese to control Chinese, that is even more ironclad proof that Japan's domestic manpower is empty.

In terms of economy, Japan is even weaker. At the beginning of this year, Japanese public opinion had expressed optimistic views on the past Japanese economic situation, and boasted that its economic foundation was strong enough to bear the dual tasks of "fighting" and "construction." This optimistic public opinion cannot deceive the Japanese people, nor can it deceive international people. Just take its most important finance and foreign trade as an example, and you can know that Japan's economy has reached a point of total collapse.

First, in terms of Japan's finances: last year, the general expenditure and the military special expenditure for the war of aggression against China were about 6.03 billion yen, which increased to more than 8.04 billion yen last year. This year, according to reports, the general expenditure is more than 3.69 billion yen, and the military special expenditure is 5.4 billion yen, totaling more than 9 billion yen. With last year's income of 8 billion yen, Japan has already shown a tendency to be unable to bear it. Compared with general income and expenditure, monthly expenditure usually exceeds between 300 million yen and 500 million yen. To fill this deficit, Japan has to do its best to exploit the people through public debt issuance, new tax increases, and currency inflation. However, these three methods have now reached the saturation point. Of the 4.3 billion yen of public debt last year, only 3.6 billion yen were sold; the increase of 230 million yen in new taxes has made people recognize that "one dish and one soup" is a luxury; the year-end issuance of 2.85 billion yen of banknotes is indeed an unprecedented record for the issuance of Japanese banknotes, but in fact, there are still a large number of military tickets and counterfeit money issued in China that have not been included in the calculation. Then this year's expenditure of 9 billion yen, in this time of poverty and exhaustion, I am afraid that there is no other way to go except to go bankrupt!

Then look at Japan's foreign trade; Japan's foreign trade is the lifeline of Japan's various industrial sectors. In the first eleven months of last year, exports were 2.39 billion yen, imports were 2.38 billion yen, and imports exceeded exports by more than 10 million yen. Japan believes that this is the best phenomenon in wartime. In fact, Japan's phenomenon of excess imports is caused by its aggressive force. Last year, Japan's trade with the so-called Japanese currency groups in the puppet Manchuria and North China increased by 40% in exports and 18% in imports compared with the previous year; however, exports and imports to Europe, the United States and other countries have decreased, and imports still continue to exceed exports, and the degree of deterioration is even more serious than before. Therefore, the Japanese government feels that the power of trade control is not enough, and also wants to promote various policies to revitalize export trade. At present, Japan's foreign trade, both exports and imports, is completely aimed at military needs under government control. Therefore, a large amount of gold is constantly flowing out, and the general non-military industries in the country are generally declining. Although the increase in other commodity prices and the unemployment of labor cannot fully reveal the truth under the supervision of the economic police, judging from the revealed phenomena, it is already on the road to deterioration.

Regardless of human or material resources, Japan has no possibility of long-term operations. What Japan is now hoping for is, on the one hand, to obtain raw materials and food for long-term operations from China, such as oil, coal, and iron in the Northeast, cotton and wool in North China, and rice in the Yangtze River Basin, which are currently being plundered as much as possible; on the other hand, it hopes to continue to sell Japan's main products to the United Kingdom, the United States and their colonies, and thus obtain supplies of raw materials and military supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, as long as China can break Japan's economic control in the guerrilla areas, and the United Kingdom and the United States can implement economic retaliation against Japan, it will be seen that the dream that Japan boasts of being able to cope with a long-term war will vanish with the collapse of national strength.

In the past, Napoleon invaded Imperial Russia. At that time, the strategy and tactics of all-out attack and long-term resistance had not yet been invented. Napoleon, with such talent and such a large army, could not avoid defeat. What's more, today, we are a republic of the nation, the spirit is generally developed, and the people of the whole country are fighting against the enemy with the same hatred. Under the command of the National Government, we are implementing the strategy and tactics of modern revolution. No force can hope to succeed by luck. Sun Tzu's chapter on terrain has three major principles: "Knowing that the enemy cannot be attacked, knowing that our soldiers cannot be attacked, and knowing that the terrain cannot be fought." Now I will add another principle for Sun Tzu: "Knowing that the enemy can be attacked, knowing that our soldiers can be attacked, knowing that the terrain can be attacked, but not knowing that the times cannot be attacked, then there is no way to win." The enemy does not know the situation of the other party, let him not recognize the times, it is unnecessary to say more and it can be understood. Just the five points mentioned above can be determined that the enemy has a reason for inevitable defeat. Now the enemy and we are in a stalemate, and the situation of victory or defeat is different. The enemy's inevitable defeat proves that I have a way to win. Just from a military point of view, when the first phase of the war was fought, it was fought in areas with convenient transportation, and his army, navy, and air force and mechanized units could enter, use, and move freely. In such a battlefield, fighting for as long as eighteen months, not only did he fail to defeat us, but we became more and more refined and stronger and stronger. From then on, in the second phase of the war, we entered a battlefield with complex terrain, staggered mountains, boundless deserts, and extremely inconvenient transportation and supplies. His tricks are naturally more difficult to use. What's more, he has used more than 85% of the country's military strength. Everyone knows that the enemy country's military equipment was originally prepared with 30% for China, while the other 70% was all for Russia. Today, in our China, not only has the military strength used exceeded his expectations by more than double, but the number of people killed or wounded in China has reached more than 35% of his total military strength. As for the detailed figures of the enemy army, I will explain them in detail to all comrades when the military report is made. Everyone sees that the enemy army's military strength, use, and deaths and injuries have reached such a degree. This proves that his failure in the invasion has been determined. Moreover, comparing the difficulty between us and the enemy in the future battlefield, one bullet of ours can be used as at least three bullets, and one soldier of ours can at least be equivalent to the strength of three enemy soldiers. And the enemy is the opposite. According to the facts and experience of our past year and a half, the enemy must use at least three people as one of our soldiers, and use three bullets as one bullet of our army, and perhaps add several times more, it is also unknown. Therefore, the problem today is that as long as our country does not give the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of, the final victory is guaranteed. What is giving the enemy an opportunity? If our spirit is threatened by it, our will is shaken, we willingly surrender, and we are eager to compromise, that is what the enemy wants. Only in this way can the enemy extricate himself from his hopeless situation and remedy his irreparable weakness, and our country and nation will be forever sunk and will never recover. In short, if we can persist in the war of resistance, we will surely win. If we cannot resolutely resist and compromise with the enemy and sign any peace agreement, then the enemy can enter endlessly according to the position he enjoys on the surrender terms. At this point, our China will be covered in the fog of the new vocabulary of the "New Order in East Asia," "Japan, Manchuria and China are inseparable," and the "East Asia Cooperation System" claimed by the enemy country. Under the cloud, he stopped breathing, covered his ears and eyes, suffered all kinds of hardships, and suffered all kinds of sacrifices. The entire China, no matter where, no matter who, will be slaughtered and ravaged by the enemy, and there is no way to escape. Once the spirit is threatened, the situation will change immediately, and once the humiliating terms are signed, the master-slave status will be established. This is tantamount to sacrificing the future lives of our Chinese descendants and saving the enemy country from danger. (To be continued tomorrow) (Electric message dated 25th)

### Zhao Tong Discusses Guerrilla Warfare Strategies

(Chongqing) General Zhao Tong, the former commander of the Northeast Volunteer Army and now the commander of the Beiping Western Hills Guerrilla Force, told visiting reporters here today that not only is Japan unable to eliminate the Chinese guerrilla forces, but the number and strength of the guerrillas are increasing day by day. His subordinates had only twenty-four men eighteen months ago, but now they have more than twenty-four thousand. Zhao also mentioned the strategy of the guerrillas, saying that each team uses half of its members to attack the Japanese army and destroy its rear traffic, while the other half is engaged in liaison with the local people.

### Direct Sino-European Air Transport: China and the UK Have Signed an Agreement; Established on a Mutual Basis; Kong Xiangxi Said the Relationship is Significant and Can Make Each Other Closer

(Chongqing) According to President Kong's statement today, the National Government has reached an agreement with the British Imperial Airways for direct air transport of passengers and mail between China and Europe, with emphasis on the UK. This method is established on a mutual basis. It is heard that the Chinese and British governments signed an agreement at 5:00 PM yesterday in the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and exchanged documents. The representative of the British government was Grenville, who is stationed here to manage British foreign affairs. It is heard that the Chinese and British authorities have agreed not to publish the full text of the agreement for the time being. The start of the new business will be the first time foreign aircraft have flown within Chinese territory with the permission of the National Government. Imperial Airways aircraft have been authorized to fly from Burma and Hong Kong to Yunnan, while China National Aviation Corporation aircraft will fly from Yunnan to Burma and Hong Kong. It is heard that negotiations on direct air transport of passengers and mail between China and the Soviet Union are also nearing completion. According to the agreement currently concluded, China National Aviation Corporation, jointly formed by China and the United States, will begin operating air services between China, Burma, and Hong Kong. According to President Kong's statement to Reuters reporters, this new undertaking between China and the UK is of great importance. In addition to the new sky link promoting trade interests between China and the UK, it will also make the Chinese and British people closer to each other, and the result will be a better understanding, which is the key to peace and prosperity between countries. This new move is very meaningful. Hundreds of years ago, camels carried silk, tea, and other goods produced in China across the desert to Europe, which took months or even years to reach, and the journey was full of dangers and may not have been certain to reach. Later, it was replaced by sailing ships and steamships, but modern airplanes have added a new page to the history of transportation between China and Europe. President Kong also said that a new highway has been connected between Yunnan and Burma, and now airplanes will connect them, and he hopes that railways will connect them soon. Imperial Airways has worked hard to plan to operate services from its base in India to Yunnan and Hong Kong, and now it has become a reality. The National Government has approved the signing of the agreement. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

(London) The aviation industry has expressed great interest in the news from Chongqing that air transport between China and Europe via Yunnan has been arranged. It is said that Professor Zhang Pengchun of Nankai University, who arrived in the UK last week, flew from Chongqing to the UK via Kunming and Hanoi, which took a total of nine days. If he had taken the route via Rangoon and flown directly from Chongqing, the time could have been reduced to five days. People here also regard this news as important because it shows the determination of the Chinese government to develop western China. As far as London knows, the news from Chongqing is a bit premature, but a formal announcement will be made in the near future. The aviation industry believes that this method mostly contains mutual concessions, that is, British aircraft can freely fly in Chinese airspace. Foreign airlines have never been allowed to enjoy this freedom. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

### Japan Does Not Forget Wu Peifu

### Puppet Regimes in the North and South End Joint Meeting

(Beiping) The joint meeting of the "Provisional" and "Upkeep" governments held here has come to an end. As far as the published resolutions are concerned, there are no surprising resolutions. What was resolved was to set up offices in Japan and "Manchukuo," send representatives to Tokyo and Changchun, and resolve to study the status of currency in order to establish a fixed currency system in North China, which means they intend to establish "Joint Reserve" paper money as the only currency circulating in the Beijing-Shanghai area and North China. The meeting also issued a statement endorsing the peace terms proposed by Konoe on December 22 last year, saying that they fully agree with these terms. If there were any resolutions on tax rates or the new "Central Government" at the meeting, they must still be kept strictly secret. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)

### Bishop Yu Bin Passes Through Europe to America; Church Relieves Refugees; Government Sends Letter of Thanks to the Pope

(Paris) Bishop Yu Bin of the Nanjing Diocese in China, in the capacity of Commissioner of the Refugee Relief Committee, representative of Shanghai charitable organizations, and Chairman of the Catholic Relief Society, was ordered to go to the Americas. He passed through Rome and paid respects to Pope Pius XI. He recently arrived in Paris and immediately gave a speech to the press, briefly saying that the time for the Catholic Church to develop in China has come. China is determined to fight to the end for independence and territorial integrity. When I recently paid respects to the Pope in Rome, I presented a letter from my country's government regarding the sincere efforts of Catholic priests to relieve the innocent women and children in China who have been poisoned by new-style weapons, expressing gratitude. This is a matter of great concern to the Catholic Church, and the Chinese government's direct expression of gratitude to the Pope is a good start. The Pope was very moved after reading it and immediately gave special blessings to me and the people in the Americas who have contributed to the relief effort, and bestowed commemorative medals, which was truly inspiring. Bishop Yu Bin also described the suffering experienced by China and the bombing of undefended cities by aircraft, saying that millions of Chinese people have died and no fewer than 30 million people are homeless. When Bishop Yu Bin was asked about the hope for peace, he replied, "The word peace is proposed by the aggressor, intending to use peace as an excuse to control China. In this regard, China will never accept anything other than a fair and lasting peace. As for Wang Jingwei, he only wants to discuss the terms proposed by Japan, not to accept them directly, as has been rumored outside." Finally, he said that the Catholic Church has a major mission in China, "There is sincere trust between the Chinese government and the church, because the Catholic Church in China is the church of China, and in France, it is the church of France. In short, it serves the country in which it is located and has no foreign color. The benefits that the Chinese people have received from the Catholic Church today are unprecedented. If he is determined to lead the Red Cross Society at the front at the age of sixty-two, it is the Belgian missionary who has become a Chinese citizen (i.e., Father Vincent Lebbe). He is the military chaplain of the Red Cross rescue team, the Benedictine priest of Belgian nationality. He is the most admirable French Jesuit priest, Father Jacquinot de Bésange, who organizes the refugee camps. The Catholic Church is always suitable, and the future is very optimistic."

In its resolutions, attention will be paid to the takeover of postal agencies, all postage will be increased, and stamps will also be reprinted. In addition to postal issues, "discussions" were also held on the issues of cotton and coal in North China, and it is heard that the production and distribution of Chinese cotton and coal will be based on Japan's needs to comply with the principle of economic cooperation between Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. In addition, the puppet organizations are also planning to control the export of rice from central China. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 25th)

### Philippine Independence Issue: Report Submitted to Congress

(Washington) Regarding the issue of independence for the Philippine Islands, the United States government promulgated a law in 1934 stipulating that the islands should be fully independent in 1946. The Philippine authorities then requested earlier political independence. The US Senate and House of Representatives formed a joint committee in April of last year to discuss the issue. Its report was recently submitted to Congress for review by President Roosevelt. Its content advocates that the political independence period for the Philippine Islands should remain at 1946, but the economic independence period should be postponed to 1960. In other words, the preferential treatment enjoyed by the islands for trade with the United States should be gradually phased out from 1946 until 1960, when their goods exported to the United States will be subject to import duties, no different from imported goods from other countries. President Roosevelt also said that he and Philippine President Quezon both expressed approval of the above report. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

### Revolution in Japan within Eight Months; China's Persistence Will Inevitably Lead to Japan's Demise; Japanese Ministry of Finance Studies Tax Increases Again; All of Suetsugu's Reform Proposals Shelved

Copenhagen, Denmark: Swedish scientist Andersson, who has engaged in archaeological work in China for many years, stated to reporters today that he expects Japan to establish a military dictatorship within four months and that a revolution will occur within eight months. He also said that if China persists in its resistance, Japan will inevitably perish. (Reuters, 25th)

(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance is currently studying tax increase proposals, planning to levy new taxes on fresh fruits, bridal attire, wool clothing, tea, coffee, potted flowers, and other items. The purpose is to raise 200 million Japanese yen. The rice wine tax, currently less than 1.5 sen per gallon, will be doubled. The tax rates on various alcoholic beverages, including beer, will also be increased, all to be implemented this year. There are currently 47 types of commodity taxes, and 23 more will be added this year. (Reuters, 25th)

(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance has scheduled a meeting of the Tariff Investigation Committee on the 28th to deliberate on the supplementary budget for special accounts for temporary military expenditures. No later than mid-February, it will submit to the parliament the amendment to the "China Incident" Special Tax Law and the amendment to the Temporary Profits Tax Law. The Ministry of Finance convened a meeting at 6 PM on the 23rd to review the draft proposal prepared by the Taxation Bureau. As a result, concrete measures have been decided on regarding the increase in profits tax and the newly established construction tax, which together account for a total of 180 million yen in the outline of the tax increase proposal. (24th Dispatch)

(Tokyo) In the House of Representatives questioning session, in addition to the two dispatches from yesterday and the day before, there are other important points. For example, Mr. Kawasaki, a leader of the Minseito Party, questioned whether the government had considered countermeasures against the Chinese people, who have a unique national character and a unique history and culture. Hiranuma replied, without deviating from his traditional views, thus revealing his lack of understanding of China. Kawasaki further asked what the "specific areas in China" mentioned in Konoe's statement on December 22nd, where Japanese troops must be stationed, referred to. Hiranuma replied that the so-called specific areas would change according to the evolution of the situation, but Mengjiang was the primary area, avoiding answering the key point. Mr. Tobu, a leader of the Seiyukai Party, questioned the routes for foreign arms shipments to China. Itagaki and Arita successively made strong statements. Tobu also asked whether there was an intention to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. Hiranuma replied that the spirit of anti-communism must be strengthened, but the specific plan could not be publicly stated. Arita replied that methods to strengthen the spirit of anti-communism were being studied. Mr. Aburadani, a leader of the Toho Party, questioned the policies toward China and third countries. Hiranuma's reply was still full of threatening tones, which everyone knew was outwardly strong but inwardly weak. On the 24th, both the upper and lower houses of the Diet held budget general meetings, and the questioning battle gradually entered into concrete issues. Kawasaki of the Minseito Party first questioned the cabinet on what preparations it had for controlling currency. If the quantity of currency increases while material remains scarce, it will be of no use. This question is most worthy of attention, and from this, one can imagine that the Japanese side cannot avoid the dual suffering of currency inflation and material scarcity. Minister of Commerce and Industry Hatta only replied that the government is asking experts to plan meticulously. Kawasaki finally asked how the cabinet plans to promote gold production. Ishiwatari replied that the gold production volume last year was lower than expected, which was the result of heavier taxation, and efforts are now being made to promote it. From this reply, it can be seen that Japan's gold production plan has also encountered setbacks. (25th Dispatch)

(Tokyo) The Japanese Imperial Household, in order to save kerosene, has completely stopped using automobiles. The vehicle recently dispatched to Tokyo Station to greet Commander of Central China Forces Shunroku Hata was also a horse-drawn carriage. At the same time, the supply of oil for civilian automobiles will soon be completely stopped. Public buses in Tokyo have been advised to install charcoal equipment in preparation for switching to charcoal. The current monthly consumption of kerosene in Japan has decreased by 35% compared to before the war. In January, the amount of oil used by private automobiles was only 15% of the usual amount. (AP, 24th)

(Tokyo) The major domestic reform proposals that former Home Minister Suetsugu had strenuously advocated have almost all been shelved by his successor, Marquis Kido. These include the revision of the election law, the Tokyo urban plan, national reorganization, the amendment of existing press laws, and the establishment of a law for journalists. The last two items mentioned above were previously unheard of and were only revealed to the outside world when their shelving was announced. Although their content has not been made public, it is conceivable that there would have been severe restrictions on the activities of Japanese newspapers and journalists. Thus, all of the proposals that Suetsugu had put forward, which led to the resignation of the Konoe Cabinet, have now been abandoned by his successor. According to Kido's intention, at a time when the whole country urgently needs unity, submitting such proposals in the current Diet session would only cause strong opposition and create unnecessary internal friction.

### Earthquake in Japan; Chile Also Greatly Shaken

(Tokyo) At 1:02 PM today, a strong earthquake occurred in northeastern and eastern Japan, affecting a wide area. Clocks in Fukushima Prefecture and other places stopped swinging indoors, and residents fled in panic. However, there have been no reports of casualties so far.

### British Government Promotes National Service; Everyone Does Their Best to Defend the Country

(London) The government has begun distributing 20 million copies of "National Service Handbook" everywhere today to carry out a grand national voluntary service plan. The book first contains an exhortation written by Prime Minister Chamberlain, which reads, "We all wish to live in peace with our neighbors, but to maintain peace, we must have strong internal strength. The country now needs your service, and you are also eager to fulfill your responsibilities. This booklet will indicate the path. I urge you to read it carefully and decide on the 'type' that best suits you." Lord Privy Seal and Minister of Civil Defence Sir Anderson also wrote a preface, saying, "This call is for peace, not for war. We have no intention of aggression. Our only wish is to live in peace with all nations. But to realize this wish, we must rise up and do it. We must make ourselves strong, and then the forces for peace can be real. We must make ourselves safe, and then others will not dare to think of aggressing against us." This booklet details the various ways that millions of men and women in various parts of Britain can serve the country. The purpose of this plan is twofold: (1) to fill the existing gaps in military and civil defense, and (2) to protect important industries and affairs in wartime. The first purpose can be achieved by distributing the "National Service Handbook," because the book lists various services and includes detailed tables and indexes. The second purpose is the main reason for printing this booklet, because it is intended to avoid recruiting people who must remain in their peacetime occupations during wartime. There are two types of application forms in the book: one for those who are willing to help, stating their name, age, address, the service they wish to join, and their current occupation; the other for stating the name, address, and business of their employer. The Ministry of Labour can use this information to decide what kind of service to recruit applicants for, or whether their service cannot be used. The list of reserved occupations involves 6-7 million men, more than 3 million of whom are over 45 years old, and one in five are between 18 and 25 years old. (Reuters, 25th)

### Germany Refuses to Pay Austrian Debt to the United States; United States Publishes Note

Washington: After the merger of Germany and Austria, all principal and interest on Austrian debt to the United States have been suspended. The United States government has sent a note to Germany, demanding that it be responsible for repayment, but Germany refuses to acknowledge this. The State Department has published the notes exchanged by both sides, the outline of which is as follows. The first note submitted by the United States government was issued on November 25th of last year, and its content was to require Germany to confirm the debts formerly owed by Austria. The German Foreign Office immediately replied, stating in essence that although the country had reached agreements with certain governments to resolve the issue of Austria's foreign debt, Germany was "not obliged to be responsible" for this debt. Germany and the United States might as well try to negotiate, but Germany's trade deficit with the United States meant that it would be difficult to reach the same agreement between Germany and the United States as the agreement between Germany and certain countries regarding the Austrian debt issue. After receiving this reply, the United States government instructed the Chargé d'Affaires in Germany on January 20th of this year to make representations to the German Foreign Office, refuting it and informing it that the United States government could not accept the German government's legal interpretation of this issue. As for the German government's view that the amount of debt that a debtor country can afford to repay should depend on the amount of its trade surplus with the creditor country, that is, if the country has a trade deficit with the creditor country, it cannot assume responsibility for repayment of debt, this view is also not something that the United States can condone. However, the United States government is still prepared to consider any suggestions that the German government can make. (Havas, 25th)

### Spanish Government Troops' Last Line of Defense Broken; Barcelona Heavily Encircled; Nationalist Troops Arrive on the Outskirts and Shell the City; President Azaña Arrives in Madrid

Lleida: It is widely believed that the fall of Barcelona is imminent. Nationalist troops, who have been moving overnight, have approached the city from all directions. (Reuters, 25th)

Lleida: The Nationalist Army Headquarters announced that the last line of defense of Barcelona has been broken, and thousands of government troops have surrendered. Last night, under artillery fire, government troops successively retreated into the city. Nationalist troops are approaching the western and southern suburbs of Barcelona in two routes, while the third route is conducting a large encirclement 20 miles north of the city. Yesterday's battle of Olesa was the most intense in the entire war situation. The defenders were ordered to fight to the death. The Nationalist artillery fired 80 shells every minute. Now that Manresa has fallen, the fate of Barcelona is decided. According to reliable sources, President Azaña has arrived in Madrid. If the government follows him, the battle of Barcelona can be concluded within two days. (Reuters, 25th)

Lleida: Manresa and Martorell are now completely occupied by the Nationalist Army. Manresa is located on the railway from Barcelona to the French border, so the loss of this town means that the government troops' valuable lifeline has been cut off. The Nationalist troops are now based on a line along the Llobregat River from each bank to a point 35 miles inland. (Reuters, 25th)

Lleida: Moroccan troops in the Nationalist Army crossed the Barcelona airfield yesterday and reached the coast road, one mile from the outskirts of Barcelona. The Nationalist artillery is now shelling the city, and 2,000 government troops were captured yesterday afternoon. (Reuters, 25th)

Barcelona: A message that ten Moroccan battalions belonging to the Nationalist Army arrived at 7:00 PM today in the southern suburbs of Barcelona, 1.5 kilometers away, has now been confirmed. The Nationalist Army Commander has decided not to attack Barcelona for the time being, but only to encircle it. Once the city's communication with the rear is cut off, it will inevitably surrender on its own within two or three days. (Havas, 24th)

Lleida: The Nationalist Army on the Catalan autonomous region front launched an offensive against Barcelona on several routes. The first route, Moroccan indigenous troops, led by General Yagüe, advanced to 1.5 kilometers south of Barcelona at 7:00 PM today and immediately opened fire with artillery, occupying the airfield on the outskirts. The second route occupied the nearby heights and then took advantage of the victory to attack Barcelona. The third route crossed the Llobregat River (southwest of Barcelona) and reached within the firing line of the Barcelona garrison. The fourth route occupied the city of Manresa (north of Barcelona) at 6:30 PM this afternoon and took advantage of the victory to encircle the government troops' rear, with the aim of achieving a pincer attack. (Havas, 24th)

Barcelona: Although Barcelona is currently under siege by six divisions of the Nationalist Army, there is still no sign of surrender. Thousands of civilians are taking buses to the countryside. Members of the unions are cleaning the streets in preparation for street fighting. General Sarabia has been appointed as the city defense commander. A large number of trucks are still constantly transporting military supplies and food to the front lines. Anyone who is afraid of war will be sentenced to death. The shipyards and docks in the city have been on fire as a result of bombing by Nationalist aircraft. The central area of the city is not yet within the range of the Nationalist artillery fire. (AP, 24th)

Madrid: City defense commander General Miaja said to the Spanish people in moving words, "When the people fight for freedom, all sacrifices, even life, are insignificant. The declaration of a 'state of war' and the centralization of control over the transport of war materials and food will strengthen our defense." (Reuters, 25th)

(Washington) Government officials are deeply disturbed by the situation in Catalonia. President Roosevelt stated yesterday afternoon that the government's legal counsel is currently engaged in research to determine whether the United States has the legal right to lift the arms embargo on Spain. Mass rallies were held last night in New York and Washington, urging the President to repeal the arms embargo. It is expected that Congress will announce a temporary suspension of the Neutrality Act within two months. Conservative and liberal newspapers have expressed concern about the situation after the Nationalist Army's victory in Spain. For example, the Washington Post wrote that the US arms embargo is tantamount to assisting Germany and Italy, and the United States may therefore pay a terrible price. Fascist Spain will be an ideal place to conduct anti-American propaganda throughout Latin America. (Reuters, 26th)

New York: 5,000 citizens marched in procession yesterday afternoon, demanding that the ban on the shipment of American arms to the Spanish Republic be lifted. The demonstrators also prepared a petition, inviting passers-by on the main streets to sign it and submit it to the government authorities to fulfill this demand. (Havas, 25th)

(New York) Regarding the issue of whether the ban on the shipment of American arms to the Spanish Republic should be lifted, after former Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull, many Christian bishops and Jewish rabbis from 35 states in the United States have jointly written to President Roosevelt to express their support, stating briefly that "This ban should be lifted immediately. If there is hesitation, not only will the Spanish Republic and other democratic countries be harmed, but also the interests on which our lives depend and world peace will be affected." In addition, the editorial staff of the liberal magazine "The New Republic" also telegraphed President Roosevelt, making the same request, stating briefly that the majority of the American people, including Catholics, sympathize with the Spanish Republican government. At this time, the democratic forces of the country are still unyielding and determined to fight to the end. It is not too late for us to provide assistance now. "Even if the collapse of the democratic forces is imminent, we should still do our best until the very end. If Your Excellency can take immediate action, not only will the situation in France and Britain be changed as a result, but the situation in the Spanish war can also be changed." (Havas, 24th)

### Alas, Czech Story; Aircraft Engines Exchanged for Coal

Prague: A delegation of German military experts has reached an agreement with the Czechs to supply Germany with high-speed Czech aircraft engines and aircraft parts in exchange for coal produced in the Sudeten mines. The authorities explained that the Munich Agreement completely deprived Czechoslovakia of its coal supply, so it is now necessary to take emergency measures to prevent this fuel shortage. (Reuters, 25th)

Prague: After Foreign Minister Chvalkovsky visited Berlin for consultation, informed sources here commented that this mission has clarified the situation. Rumors that Germany hopes to establish a customs union with Czechoslovakia and reorganize the Czech army have also been dispelled. Generally speaking, regarding certain issues between the two sides, Foreign Minister Chvalkovsky will return home to consult with the ministers of various departments, and then go to Berlin again to conduct formal negotiations. (Havas, 25th)

### Memel Becoming National Socialist

Kovno: Petrulaitis, Director of the Memel Administration, recently spoke to his subordinates, saying that Lithuanians in the Memel region must adhere to National Socialism, and all anti-National Socialist propaganda cannot be tolerated and must be eliminated. Petrulaitis has formally adopted the National Socialist salute. (Reuters, 25th)

### Chamberlain's Merits and Demerits Still Difficult to Determine

Stockholm: Twelve members of the Swedish Parliament have proposed that the 1939 Nobel Peace Prize be awarded to British Prime Minister Chamberlain. This proposal has been submitted to the Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee. Their view is that in September 1938, the general situation in Europe was in grave danger, but it was thanks to the efforts of Prime Minister Chamberlain that the catastrophe was averted, and his contribution cannot be denied. (Reuters, 25th)

London: Former Foreign Office official Viscount Cranborne said in a speech in Weymouth that Britain's current weakness is only making war closer. He has not seen any signs of Germany and Italy responding to Chamberlain's peace policy. He is not as optimistic as Chamberlain. He believes that Britain is currently in a year of great anxiety or crisis. Dictators such as Germany and Italy have conducted red-blooded experiments and have achieved some success by using force. Why is Britain abandoning policies that seem to have been effective? If Britain wants to maintain its freedom and European civilization, it should make itself an impenetrable fortress at any cost. (Reuters, 25th)

### Rapid Turnaround in the Spanish War Situation; Italy Deploys Troops in a Show of Force; Germany and the Nationalist Army Sign a Cultural Agreement; Britain and France Hint at Concessions to Italy

(London) It is reported that 30,000 Italian army personnel are concentrated in Genoa and La Spezia. If French forces cross the border, they will immediately enter Spain. It is also reported that Italy issued a warning today, stating that if France intervenes due to the victory of the Nationalist Army, Italy will consider the non-intervention agreement a failure and resume free action. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)

(Rome) According to unofficial sources, several Italian army experts have been summoned for several days of training. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)

(Rome) An official bulletin recently announced that the government has decided to summon a batch of reserve soldiers born in 1901, totaling 60,000, to enlist for training on the first of next month. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)

(London) The British North Sea Fleet has recently sailed to the Strait of Gibraltar. According to official announcements, the Navy points out that recently, in the western Mediterranean, near the Strait of Gibraltar, Britain and France have gathered a large number of naval forces there. Given the recent tension between France and Italy and the decisive stage of the Spanish Civil War, it seems to have political significance. (Haitong dispatch on the 25th)

Burgos: General Jordana, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Nationalist Army government, recently formally signed a cultural agreement with German Ambassador General Faupel. The main points of the agreement are as follows: (1) Both parties shall establish specialized institutions in their respective countries to study the culture of the other party. (2) Both governments shall encourage their citizens to study the language of the other party. (3) Exchange university students. (4) Germany may establish schools in the territory of the Spanish Nationalist Army government, adopt German education methods, and the diplomas issued by these schools shall be recognized by the Ministry of Education of the Spanish Nationalist Army government. (5) Both parties agree to prohibit political exiles from the other party from publishing works detrimental to the other party in their respective countries. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

(London) Well-informed sources here recently declared that Prime Minister Chamberlain firmly believes that once the Spanish Nationalist Army achieves final victory, Germany and Italy will jointly make colonial demands. Therefore, he intends to propose a four-power conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to discuss the Mediterranean and colonial issues. He also intends to propose to Italy that the debt owed by the Spanish Nationalist Army government to Italy could be borne by Britain. This could allow France to make the following concessions to Italy: (1) The legal status of Italian nationals in French Tunisia in North Africa should be revised. (2) The French Djibouti port in East Africa should be a free port to facilitate Italian commerce. (3) Italians should be appointed as directors of the Suez Canal Company. (4) Italy should participate in the management rights of the railway from the French Djibouti port to Addis Ababa. However, these concessions by Britain and France should be conditional on Italy's commitment to completely withdraw its volunteer soldiers from Spain. Otherwise, France may decide to send troops to the Spanish island of Minorca (in the Balearic Islands) or Spanish Morocco, and the British government may approve of it. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)

### Under Japanese Military Harassment, the Situation in Quanzhou Bay, Southern Fujian, Assumes an Important Mission of International Trade; Many Reefs in the Sea Prevent Japanese Troops from Landing

Fuzhou Dispatch: The harassment by Japanese warships in the Xiayu Anchorage area of Quanzhou Port in southern Fujian is quite serious. However, the exact situation there is rarely known to the outside world. According to those who have come to Fuzhou from the area, after the fall of Xiamen, the economic focus of southern Fujian shifted to Quanzhou. Xiayu, outside Quanzhou Bay, has become the only seaport in southern Fujian for international trade. Chimneys and masts fill the Xiayu sea. The Anqing ship, sailing on the Fujian-Philippines route, the Jinan ship, Fujian ship on the Quanzhou-Shanghai route, the Zhidu ship, Haitan ship on the Quanzhou-Xianggang route, the Santa Anna ship on the Quanzhou-Wenzhou route, and the Anhui ship on the Fujian-Singapore route (Singapore) are all anchored in this desolate Xiayu. Therefore, Xiayu suddenly assumes an important mission of domestic and international trade. Thus, although Xiamen has changed color, the economic artery of southern Fujian is still beating. Quanzhou is also becoming increasingly prosperous.

Fujian currently has three gateways for international routes: one is Chuanshi in Fuzhou, the second is Hanjiang in Putian, and the third is Xiayu in Quanzhou. In terms of exports, Chuanshi is more important than Hanjiang and Xiayu. In terms of imports, Xiayu is more important than Chuanshi and Hanjiang. After the fall of Xiamen, Quanzhou not only bears the task of supplying daily industrial products to Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, Anxi, Yongchun, and Dehua counties, but also must be responsible for the economic needs of the counties under Zhangzhou. Therefore, Quanzhou's position is now several times higher than before the war, but Xiayu's position is several times more important than Quanzhou. The distance between Quanzhou and Xiayu is two hours by sea. The ship sails out of Quanzhou Bay, passes Xiutu, and then turns at an oblique angle to reach Xiayu. The entire port has more than a thousand households, and the houses are arranged facing the sea. In front is a stretch of alluvial beach. Beyond the beach is the Xiayu Sea, the busy economic artery of southern Fujian. The two islands of Dazhui and Xiaozhui at the mouth of the sea serve as natural sentries, guarding the first line of coastal defense. When Xiamen fell last May and southern Fujian was in a critical situation, the Dazhui gateway was closed, leaving only Xiaozhui open for ships to enter and exit. However, Japanese warships cannot pass without a Chinese pilot because there are many reefs buried in the sea. Therefore, although Japanese warships have harassed Xiayu for many days, constantly bombarding with cannons and machine-gun fire, Chinese troops and civilians guarding the trenches calmly resisted and waited for the enemy to tire. In the end, the Japanese troops could not land and had to leave in frustration. Now Quanzhou Bay is calm, and ships from various countries are still entering and leaving the Xiayu Sea as usual.

### On the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway, the Japanese Repeatedly Attempt to Break Through but Fail; Japanese Troops in Xuzhou Recruit Bandits to Control Chinese with Chinese, But the Heterogeneous Crowd Collapses Upon Encounter

Xuzhou Dispatch: The Japanese troops entrenched in Xuzhou and Lianyungang have repeatedly tried to break through the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in order to establish direct contact and plunder the Donghai salt marshes. However, they have been severely attacked by Chinese troops in every attempt. The Japanese troops in Lianyungang are still confined to the Wai Yuntai Mountain area and cannot invade westward. The Japanese troops in Xuzhou, after capturing Suixu, have repeatedly tried to attack eastward but have been repelled by Chinese troops and cannot succeed. Recently, the Japanese army in Xuzhou, realizing that its forces are limited and unable to attack eastward, has changed its strategy and sent people to recruit bandits from large and small groups in eastern Xuzhou, forming three armies. The great traitor Jin Xiaohu is the commander of the puppet First Army, Liu Fulong is the commander of the puppet Second Army, and Japanese rōnin Utsumi is the deputy commander. Li Guanying is the commander of the puppet Third Army, and Japanese Yamaguchi is the deputy commander. The Second and Third Armies were reorganized into the Longhai Eastward Advance Army and concentrated for roll call on the first of this month before departing. The central route is the Japanese army's infantry, artillery, and engineers, invading eastward from Bayiji. Liu's bandits gathered in Tushan and attacked eastward to the Xinjil area in Picheng. Encountering attacks from Chinese troops, Liu's bandits could not resist and retreated. They requested reinforcements from the Japanese army, which burned dozens of villages in Xinjicun. As of recently, they have reportedly approached Yaowan Maowo. The Japanese army on the central route has now reached the Yunhe Railway Station, attempting to cover the construction of a bridge and road (Longhai Railway). They have now been blocked head-on by Chinese troops, who will not allow them to continue attacking eastward. Li Guanying's bandit puppet army on the northern route gathered in Jia and Daquan and set off. On the fourth, they attacked eastward to Xiaotashan in Biantang Township and were defeated head-on by local militia. Li's bandits asked the Japanese army for help, and the Japanese army sent more than a hundred mechanized units. On the seventh, they arrived at Biantang and were bravely attacked by the militia. The Japanese army suffered more than a dozen deaths and seven or eight injuries. The Japanese army still could not succeed and continued to mobilize a large number of reinforcements, concentrating four or five steel cannons to bombard Xiaotashan Village, which was finally breached. The Japanese army massacred more than two hundred unarmed farmers who had not escaped, as a reprisal, and used strong artillery fire to cover Li's bandit puppet army, passing through Biantang. The Japanese army also escorted Li's bandits to Tanshang in Picheng with two tanks. On the tenth, they were blocked head-on by Chinese garrison forces on the east bank of the Grand Canal. The two sides are facing each other across the river, and the Japanese puppets have not been able to cross the river. They are still in a stalemate. This time, the Japanese army used bandits to assist in the attack. Each unit was supplied with some military supplies and old arms. However, the bandits are after all a heterogeneous crowd and collapse upon encountering resistance. Therefore, they are vulnerable.

The bandits bought by the Japanese army are vulnerable, but the Japanese army, in order to implement the vicious plan of controlling Chinese with Chinese, especially pressured the puppet maintenance committees in various places to force local farmers to pay land tax, ranging from six jiao, one yuan, to one yuan and two jiao per mu. The funds collected are still used to buy bandits in various places. Liu Qi and other bandits have recently been lured, gathering in large numbers, burning and plundering, and are even more unscrupulous. The people hate them to the bone. The armed people of Xiaotashan Village are very strong. Liu Qi's bandit gang intended to occupy the village, but the people firmly refused to allow them to enter. Liu's bandits launched an attack, and after two days and nights of fierce fighting, many bandits were killed. The bandit gang again asked the Japanese army for help, and the Japanese army sent a unit of troops to assist in the attack. More than a dozen Japanese soldiers were still killed by the people of the village. Later, the Japanese army sent more troops to aid, and the village was breached. The Japanese army and the bandits then carried out a large-scale massacre. It is estimated that more than three hundred people in the village were killed, their corpses scattered all over the ground, a tragic sight.

Regarding the recent situation in Lianyungang, according to military intelligence: (1) Since Daweijian, under the jurisdiction of Guanyun County, was occupied by the Japanese army, more than a hundred Japanese puppet troops have been stationed there, with four heavy machine guns and two light machine guns. They are often attacked by Ding's Chinese troops. As a result, the Japanese army does not dare to cross the Lei Pond. (2) Two small Japanese gunboats, one transport ship, and two small motorboats are anchored in the Laoyao waters under the jurisdiction of Guanyun County, patrolling back and forth on the sea.

### Japanese Warships Discovered Off Dinghai

Dinghai is on Alert

Dinghai Dispatch: At 7:30 AM on the 21st, three Japanese warships were discovered off Dinghai, sailing to the Luotou waters outside Zhushanmen, more than ten li from the county seat of Dinghai. At that time, the Libao ship of the Zhengde Company, a Ningbo-Dinghai-Qianpu shipping company, was sailing from Dinghai to Ningbo. The Japanese warship questioned it by signal flag. After the Libao ship owner answered, it was released. The Japanese warship also sailed into Zhushanmen Port. The Dinghai defense forces are on strict alert.

### Chinese Troops Attack Gongbu Twice; Fierce Fighting Between the Two Armies in Tangqi; Fighting Also Occurs Near the Suburbs of Chang'an

Hangzhou Dispatch: Liu's Chinese troops and Jiang Shuwei's troops of the Zhejiang militia, advanced victoriously from the Yuhang Highway on the 20th and recaptured Gongchen Bridge, continuing to advance towards Hangzhou City. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 21st, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers suddenly came from Shanghai, and under the cover of artillery and aircraft, launched a fierce attack on the Chinese positions in Gongbu. In order to avoid sacrifices, the Chinese troops temporarily withdrew to X.X. On the morning of the 22nd, the Chinese troops took the opportunity to charge into Gongbu again, but soon abandoned it. Therefore, the area has been extremely chaotic in recent days. In addition to building fortifications in the city, the Japanese army has also transferred a large number of reinforcements from the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, stationed in Qingbomen, Qiantangmen, Yongjinmen, etc.

Since the 23rd, the Japanese army in Tangqi in the suburbs of Hangzhou has been attacked by Chinese troops from Huzhou in four directions. The Japanese army's defense fortifications have all been destroyed, and one of the Japanese soldiers' houses has been burned down. The Chinese and Japanese armies are still fighting fiercely there, so land and water transportation have been completely cut off.

Near Chang'an, along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, Chinese and Japanese troops encountered each other on the Hai'ning Highway a few days ago. Casualties on both sides were minor.

### 128 Commemoration: Open Letter to the Citizens from the City Party Headquarters: Hang Flags – Observe Silence – Donate Funds

The eighth anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai Anti-Japanese War is approaching. The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters is issuing a notice to the public to implement three things, as recorded below:

Fellow citizens of Shanghai, today, one year and six months after the launch of the all-out war of resistance, we commemorate the anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai Anti-Japanese War eight years ago and deeply feel infinite sorrow, grief, and excitement. We believe that this great and glorious day of sacred commemoration of resisting enemy invasion can only be expressed through active and concrete actions. Only then can we live up to the soldiers who died in battle for the war of resistance and the compatriots who were killed. Only active and concrete actions can show the enthusiasm of our people for resisting the war, give the enemy a powerful blow, and win the final victory for our country. Now, three things are listed, hoping that all citizens of the city will practice them in person and earnestly do them.

First, all shops, schools, groups, and households in the city should hang flags at half-mast for one day. The national flag is the sole symbol representing the country. Every citizen of a country cannot but express supreme respect and love for the national flag. Our country is in the midst of a war of resistance, and Shanghai has fallen. We should even more fly our dignified and sacred Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth national flag over the entire city behind enemy lines. Not only shops, schools, and groups should universally hang flags, but also general residents should hang flags in every household to express our mourning for the soldiers who died in battle and the compatriots who were killed. At the same time, it also expresses the warm spirit of our people in the occupied areas who love the country and support the war of resistance.

Second, at noon on the January 28th commemorative day, all citizens of the city should stand in place and observe three minutes of silence to mourn the soldiers who died in battle for the war of resistance and the compatriots who were killed. All entertainment venues in the city should be closed to commemorate.

Third, on this day commemorating January 28th, all citizens of the city should make frugal donations, and all shops in the city should hold charity sales for one day. During the war of resistance, contributing financial resources, materials, and manpower to the country is the duty of every descendant of the Yellow Emperor. All citizens of the city should send the proceeds from their past frugality to the various banks in Shanghai and ask them to voluntarily remit them to the government. All shops in the city should also hold charity sales for one day and send all the profits of the day to the banks and present them to the government.

Fellow citizens of the city, we should encourage and supervise each other to ensure that all of us, regardless of men, women, old, or young, can practice the above three things in person and do them earnestly. Children of China, arise, work hard, and strive to complete the war of resistance!

### Under Certain Conditions, the Customs Resumes Branch Offices; Three Branch Offices in the Near Suburbs are Established; A Large Number of Japanese Customs Officials are Hired

The matter of the Japanese side coercing the Jianghai Customs to resume branch offices and hire a large number of Japanese senior customs officials has recently been approved by Chief Secretary Robert through Director-General May. It has been decided to resume three offices first. However, the Japanese side has not yet agreed to open the Wusong branch, which is still under negotiation. The following is an investigation by the reporter of Modern News Agency regarding the various situations:

Resumption of Three Branch Offices

In order to resume branch offices in various war zones, the Jianghai Customs authorities were blackmailed by the Japanese side to hire a large number of Japanese customs officials. This matter has been approved by Chief Secretary May. It has been decided to first restore the customs powers of the branch offices in the near suburbs of Shanghai, namely the North Railway Station, Xujiahui, and Caojiadu. The implementation of customs inspection will begin on February 1st. All senior personnel will be Japanese. Several Western customs officials will be sent to assist. The number of Japanese personnel to be hired for these three branch offices is still under discussion. However, our Chinese customs officials have all expressed their refusal to participate. No one is willing to serve in the branch offices under the armed coercion of the Japanese side.

Difficulty in Restoring Wusong Customs

British Tax Commissioner Robert previously pointed out that the failure to restore the Wusong customs rights and the rampant smuggling incidents have had a significant impact on tax revenue. He repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side for the return of the customs so that he could perform his duties, but to no avail. Recently, when mentioning the restoration of branch offices in various places, Tax Commissioner Robert immediately demanded that the Wusong branch be restored first, but was again rejected by the Japanese side, who believe that the area is still a military fortress and cannot be opened. Negotiations are being carried out repeatedly, but the outcome is still unknown. After the restoration of the three branch offices such as the North Railway Station, it is feared that foreign goods will be abused and discriminated against by the Japanese side when they are inspected in the future. Foreigners are particularly concerned about this.

### Special Registration Method for Party Members

Drafted by the Central Executive Committee

The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, considering that the general registration held by the Party in the 17th year was too strict, resulting in some comrades with a revolutionary history losing their opportunity and not obtaining appropriate Party membership, specially formulated the "Special Registration Method for Members of the Chinese Kuomintang" as follows:

Request Credentials: (1) Anyone who has one of the following circumstances may request special registration: A. A member of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, with a membership certificate or other credentials sufficient to prove it; B. A member of the Kuomintang, with a membership certificate or other credentials sufficient to prove it; C. A member of the Chinese Revolutionary Party, with a membership certificate or other credentials sufficient to prove it; D. Anyone who obtained Party membership from the reorganization of the Party in the 13th year to the general registration in the 17th year, with a membership certificate or other credentials sufficient to prove it. If the special registrant in items A, B, and C has no sufficient credentials, but has two or more current members or party members who were members or party members at the time and issue a written proof, which is approved by the Central Committee, may also request special registration. The certificate of proof is to be determined separately.

Required Procedures: (2) Anyone who meets the requirements of the preceding paragraph shall, when requesting special registration, submit the credentials or certificate of proof, fill out the special registration form, and attach two recent two-and-a-half-inch half-length photos and send them directly to the Central Organization Department. After passing the examination, the Party member certificate will be issued and reported to the Central Standing Committee for record. The special registration form is to be determined separately. (3) This method shall be implemented upon resolution by the Central Executive Committee meeting.

### Charity Sale to be Held Throughout the City on January 28 Commemoration Day: From 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM; All Profits to be Presented to the Government

The eighth anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai Anti-Japanese War is approaching. Shops throughout the city intend to voluntarily hold charity sales and present the profits of the day to the government. Now, the leaders of the business community in this city have specially drafted a set of charity sale methods to ensure uniformity. They are recorded as follows: (1) The period of the charity sale is from 6:00 AM on January 28th of this year to 10:00 PM on that day. (2) Wood Seal: All stores participating in the charity sale shall affix a charity sale wood seal on the invoices for all goods sold on that day. (3) Submit to the Bank: The day's business income, after deducting the original capital, all profits, should be submitted to Shanghai banks before 12:00 noon the next day and ask them to present it to the government on their behalf. It is even better if both the principal and interest are presented together (4) Public Announcement in the Newspaper: All stores participating in the charity sale may make a public announcement in the newspaper to all sectors of society in advance. The total amount of profits for one day may also be announced in the newspaper to all sectors of society to show good faith.

### Off the Coast of Wenzhou: British Ship Lost and Sunk; Whether it is the Kai Bo Ship Cannot be Confirmed, Only the Chimney Markings Indicate a Chinese Ship

Yesterday morning, various radio stations in this city received a telegram from the De Ping ship of the China-Italy Company at the mouth of the Ou River, stating that a ship had sunk near Songmenshan, off the coast of Wenzhou, at a position of 121.38 degrees east longitude and 28.16 degrees north latitude. Only the two chimneys and masts were seen protruding from the water. After observing the chimney markings, it belongs to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, a British company located at 93 Guangdong Road. After receiving the news, the reporter went to inquire. According to the answer, the above telegram was indeed received, and it was said that there are two ships sailing on that route. One is leased to the Xinchang'an Company, named Xinronghua, sailing on the Fuzhou line, departing from Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (24th). The other is named Kaibo, weighing 3,075 tons, leased to the Lihe Foreign Firm's Moufu Shipping Department, sailing on the Shanghai-Oujiang-Ningbo-Qianpu line, and departed from Shanghai for Ningbo on the day before yesterday (23rd). According to the ship's telegram, it arrived at Oujiang at around 9:00 AM on the 24th and anchored outside the port, and then went to the customs to complete the customs clearance. It started anchorage to Ningbo at 9:30 PM that afternoon. Therefore, it is not known which ship sank there. However, after the city received the telegram yesterday morning, it sent calls to the two ships from three radio stations. As of 6:00 PM, there was still no definite news. The truth can be clarified today.

### Shanghai Film Industry: Makes a Solemn Statement

Rejecting Threats and Inducements

The so-called president of the Japan International Film News Agency, Ichioka Aya, who is attempting to attack the Chinese film industry and expanding the Japanese film market in North China and Shanghai, has now dispatched minions to actively engage in activities in Shanghai. However, the Shanghai film industry understands the righteousness and will never cooperate with the Japanese side, no matter how difficult the environment. It is reported that the Japanese side has recently sent people to various companies, requesting them to send domestic films to be shown in various occupied areas, and at the same time intends to seize the right to censor films in Shanghai. It is rumored that the Japanese side also intends to host a banquet for the heads of various companies in the coming days, but given the firm attitude of the various companies, and the fact that the facilities of the various companies after the war are all decided by the entire staff, the Shanghai film industry, which has a glorious history, will definitely resolutely reject all threats and inducements from the Japanese side.

### Overseas Compatriots: Promoting Thrift

Increasing Wartime Economic Strength; Striving to Promote Thrift in Light of Local Circumstances

In order to increase the strength of the war of resistance and cultivate a frugal national spirit, the government authorities are promoting a thrift movement, which is now being universally implemented domestically. Overseas compatriots have recently also been instructed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to comply with local circumstances. The gist of the content is: the First Session of the People's Political Council proposed the promotion of the overseas Chinese thrift movement, which was resolved by the Supreme National Defense Council and handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee for handling. It is now found that the thrift movement is an important task for our country at present. The thrift and contribution of overseas Chinese to the motherland is also extremely beneficial to foreign exchange and the economic future of the motherland. The general outline of thrift has already been promulgated, and overseas compatriots can strive to promote it in light of local circumstances without violating the principles.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Salary Increase Investigation Committee: Meeting Today

The Committee of Commercial Representatives organized by the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council to review the salary increase plan has been working for several days. Foreign ratepayers such as Steadward, fearing that the committee would act hastily and without thorough investigation, and submit a report, sent a letter to the committee, requesting to attend the meeting and discuss it together. According to the gazette issued by the committee yesterday, when the committee meets at 4:15 PM on the 26th, it will invite Steadward and three or four other representatives of the ratepayers to attend the meeting to listen to their opinions. However, the names of all attendees must be notified to the committee before noon that day.

### Guerrilla Raid on Japanese Army Supply Station in Minhang; Fierce Fighting on Both Sides; Injured Peddlers Come to Shanghai for Treatment

According to the French Shanghai Daily, two Shandong peddlers injured last night came to Shanghai and were admitted to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to their account of the injuries, guerrilla forces of Chinese troops have been discovered in the Minhang area. When they were carrying their homemade pancakes to sell there yesterday morning, they happened to encounter Chinese troops attacking the Japanese army supply station. The fighting was extremely fierce, causing them to be injured by stray bullets, so they crawled to Shanghai for treatment.

### Baoshan Guerrilla Force Executes Spies

Extremely Active Around Yanghang, Weak Japanese Army Holds Still

In the Yanghang Township area under Baoshan County, there is currently a Chinese army guerrilla force operating and controlling the water and land transportation in the surrounding villages. The Japanese army in the county seat does not dare to underestimate or attack this force, and due to their weak strength, they are holding still. In order to actively carry out anti-traitor work, the guerrilla force recently captured several "detectives" sent by the Shanghai puppet "Detective Team," selecting two who were loyal to serving as slaves and spying on the guerrilla force's activities for the Japanese. After interrogation, the two puppet "detectives" admitted to specializing in sabotaging the guerrilla force's work and have been executed by firing squad at a certain location. Before long, the translator of the town's puppet "police station" was also captured by the guerrilla force the day before yesterday. The reason for the arrest was also for specializing in serving as a spy for the Japanese army. After the two incidents occurred, the Japanese puppets were greatly frightened and have been intensifying their defenses in the Songbao area in recent days, it is said.

### Passengers and Goods Passing Through Hanoi: Transit Procedures

Passenger Passport Visas, Goods Taxed Accordingly

Since the fall of Guangzhou, the Yuehan Railway has been interrupted, and passengers and goods intending to go to the Northwest and Southwest have changed their routes to transit through Hanoi to various destinations. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday about the transit procedures for passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to Hanoi, as follows: All passengers traveling to Hanoi, regardless of gender, must obtain a passport from the visa office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong before departure, and then obtain a visa from the French Consulate before being allowed to land upon arrival in French territory. This is a routine procedure. The transit procedures after arriving in Hanoi include: (1) Paying transit tax on passengers and goods. The tax rate is in accordance with the Sino-French-Vietnamese treaty. For Chinese goods exported from China, passing through Vietnam, and then entering China, a transit tax must be paid when passing through Vietnam, at a rate of one percent of the value. For non-Chinese goods or goods not shipped from Chinese territory, a transit tax of four percent of the value is levied. However, passenger goods are also handled at a rate of one percent of the value. (2) Customs clearance procedures: After import goods are declared and taxed, the goods can be picked up. However, transit goods cannot be picked up and must be guaranteed by a reliable local store to ensure that the goods will not be used or sold in Vietnam. Inspection is very strict, and once discovered, the penalties are particularly severe.

### Rickshaws Should Be Modified, Otherwise They Will Not Be Inspected

Rickshaw Dealers Did Not Follow Regulations, the Bureau of Works Sent a Letter to the Guild to Notify

Since the Bureau of Works announced that new rickshaw designs would be used starting January 1st, many rickshaw dealers have continued to violate the regulations. Yesterday, a notice was sent to the rickshaw guild stating: "The improved rickshaw design has been approved by the board of directors of the Bureau of Works. The design is currently on display on Gordon Road. In the past two or three weeks, rickshaw dealers who have replaced rickshaws have not followed the improved design. Therefore, it is hereby notified that all rickshaw dealers must install new rickshaws according to the improved design from now on, except for those with completed bodies and paint. Otherwise, they will not be inspected."

### Handicrafts Shipped for Participation in the Golden Gate Exposition

The National Government Appoints Consul General in San Francisco as Chairman of the "Chinese Village"

The goods from Shanghai manufacturers participating in the United States International Exposition have been collected and prepared thanks to the active efforts of Mr. Lu Shoulian, manager of the International Hotel. They include jade, porcelain, lacquerware, brocade, blankets, Lama hanging images, and handicrafts, totaling more than 200 boxes. They will be loaded onto the Japanese Outer Queen Wheel of the Changxing Company today for transport to the United States for exhibition. The ship will leave Shanghai for the United States tomorrow morning and is expected to arrive in San Francisco in time for the opening of the conference on February 13th or 14th. In addition to Mr. Lu himself, the Shanghai participating representatives will also include Qin Runsheng and Wang Chunzhe, who will remain in Shanghai to negotiate the subsequent shipment of goods to the United States. The management team will be represented by Zhang Danzi, Wu Daochang, and Jin Silang, who will be dispatched by Mr. Lu to take care of everything.

As for the personnel sent to Hangzhou to collect goods, they have already returned to Shanghai and have collected many famous local specialties and handicrafts, such as clay figurines, rattan baskets, etc. These items are quite exquisite and will be rushed to produce more so that they can be shipped to the United States for exhibition and purchased by Americans. In addition, a batch of jadeite was collected, but due to the urgent preparation time and the time-consuming installation, it could not be packed and shipped to the United States on schedule. It will be transported continuously in the coming days. Although the Chinese government authorities do not intend to send personnel to the United States to participate due to the ongoing war, in order to promote China's inherent art, the National Government has telegraphed the Chinese Consul General in San Francisco, USA, to serve as the chairman of the "Chinese Village" at the conference. Regarding the rumors that Cheng Yanqiu and others will be invited to participate, it is said that this is not true. However, Mr. Lu hopes that the handicrafts produced by refugees in Shanghai and the local handicrafts sold in the former Chenghuang Temple can be welcomed by the general public. He himself hopes that local handicraft merchants will contact the International Hotel for arrangements to ship them to the United States for participation and to promote China's inherent art.

### Ministry of Finance Issues Order to Investigate and Prohibit the Private Printing of Legal Tender, Japan Secretly Prints Tens of Millions of Dollars in Shanghai, Orders Japanese Spies and Residents to Use Them Everywhere

The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed to the provincial and municipal governments and the guilds of the banking industry: "According to reliable reports, Japan has secretly printed tens of millions of dollars of our legal tender in Shanghai and is using Japanese spies, residents, and traitors to circulate them in various places. It is now reported that the printing has been completed." The Ministry of Finance believes that the Japanese secretly printing legal tender in Shanghai and circulating it in various places has a significant impact on finance. Therefore, it is appropriate to issue a general order for attention, investigation, and prohibition to prevent this. In addition to secretly forwarding the information to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, and instructing their branches to pay attention and secretly ordering the Shanghai branch to obtain counterfeit notes, identify the differences between genuine and counterfeit notes, and report and telegraph the information, we are correspondingly requesting that you investigate and prohibit your subordinates from paying attention, investigating, and prohibiting this matter.

### Interest Income Tax Handling Fee Will Still Be Returned to Depositors

Ministry of Finance Approved Extension for Six Months, Until the End of June This Year

The Shanghai Banking Industry Association received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating: "The Shanghai Banking Industry Association has received the telegram. The case of granting a handling fee of 0.1% for deposit interest income tax to be returned to depositors has been extended repeatedly until the end of December 1938. Now, as the national crisis is intensifying and military needs are urgent, strengthening the resistance depends on everyone's efforts. After the deadline, it should be stopped immediately. However, according to the information you provided, the situation is still true. In the spirit of mutual support between the upper and lower levels, we will temporarily approve the extension of this case for another six months, until June 30, 1939. After the deadline, no further requests may be made to respect the tax policy. You must immediately notify all colleagues to deduct and pay taxes in accordance with the plan. In addition to submitting a report to the Executive Yuan to be forwarded to the National Government for record, we are issuing this special response for compliance."

### Materials Aiding the Enemy Prohibited from Being Transported to Shanghai

Zhejiang Customs Notified According to Order, Totaling 54 Items of Cotton

The Shanghai shipping companies received a telegram from the Ningbo Shipping Association yesterday, stating that they had received a notice from Zhejiang Customs, which stated that they had received a telegram from the Chief Inspector of Customs of the Ministry of Finance: "Strictly investigate and prohibit the transportation of materials aiding the enemy, totaling 54 items, including cotton and its products. Shanghai is a place controlled by enemy violence and should be subject to a preliminary ban on transportation. Please comply accordingly." In addition to handling the transportation, we hope you will inform all shipping companies. According to the shipping industry's statement to the Modern News Agency reporter, if the order is formally implemented, ships traveling on the Shanghai-Oujiang-Taizhou-Ningbo routes will have no cargo to carry when returning to Shanghai. The companies are considering reducing the number of voyages to avoid losses.

### Foreign Reporters Discuss the Imminent Collapse of the Japanese Army

Currently in a Frequent State of Economic Bankruptcy, Possible Defeat and Depletion of Resources

The Continental Press reports that Mr. Zhang Bolun, the Far East correspondent of the Christian Science Monitor in Tokyo, traveled to North China and Manchuria after departing from Tokyo at the beginning of this month and arrived in Shanghai three days ago. Yesterday (the 24th), he told reporters that Japan's arrogance has been damaged by the protracted Sino-Japanese War. However, the Japanese people still console themselves by saying that this war is not only with China but also with the great powers.

As far as Japan is concerned, this war is far from over, and no one in Japan knows how it will end. Japan is frequently on the verge of economic bankruptcy, and the collapse of the Japanese military is not far away. There are two things that could immediately change the war situation: One is that a disastrous defeat on the battlefield would collapse the spirit of the Japanese people. China's guerrilla warfare can contain the Japanese army's advance or obstruct the Japanese army's transportation lines, but it cannot achieve a major victory on the battlefield. On the other hand, the depletion of manpower and food supplies can also lead to the collapse of the Japanese army. The reduction in Japan's imports has already affected its industries. Cotton, zinc, wool, and kerosene are Japan's major imports, but they can no longer be imported at will. Japan is transporting its goods to the so-called yen bloc countries to make up for part of the losses it has suffered from importing raw materials from foreign countries, but this move still cannot increase its foreign exchange reserves. This war has obscured Japanese liberalism, and even the Social People's Party has leaned to the right towards the military. To please the masses, the Japanese military often attacks capitalists as exploiters for the sake of the poor.

Japanese newspapers are simply echoing the Japanese government's "suggestions." In short, the Japanese people hope to know more about the outside world's dynamics and believe that the war is true. It is reported that Mr. Zhang went to Tokyo from Moscow four years ago as a correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor. He will travel to China this time and then travel to Vietnam via Hong Kong.

### Factories in War Zones Change Organizations, Products Are Not Entirely National Goods, Pre-War Certificates Are Invalid, Products Operated with Enemy Funds Are Prohibited from Being Transported and Sold Everywhere

The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently issued a notice to administrative agencies and people's organizations in various regions stating that many national goods factories in the war zones have changed their organizations after the war, or have been taken over by the enemy, or have even invested in cooperation. It is obvious that all their products are no longer entirely national goods. The various certificates of national goods issued before the war should be deemed invalid. Those operated with enemy funds should be prohibited from transporting and selling their products everywhere. In addition, it has issued multiple investigation forms for national goods factories, ordering them to investigate in detail the general situation of the factories after the war and the changes in their organizations in order to understand the situation and avoid being deceived.

### Endocrinology: Progressive Transformation

— Yang Daonan, Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Animal Suffering, Human Gospel

The progress of endocrinology is entirely based on the success of animal experiments. After careful research by numerous experts, it has been proven that the endocrine hormones of animals with the same physical constitution as humans, such as chimpanzees, cattle, sheep, and sea dogs, can be supplied to the human body to achieve rejuvenation. It has also been discovered that ingesting the lungs, heart, blood vessels, or liver of the above-mentioned animals can be used to supplement human organs when they are diseased. This is the modern endocrine therapy that has shocked the medical world. However, this invention has been improved through the efforts of numerous experts, so it is constantly progressing rapidly.

Now, its effective components can be extracted and used for therapeutic applications. In terms of usage, simplicity and effectiveness are sought, from injections to oral medications. The goal is for a small amount of medicine to exert a large effect, which has created the brilliant state of modern endocrinology.

At the same time, through multifaceted experiments, it has been determined that the endocrine hormones in the testicles are more effective than anything else, because the testicles contain an ingredient that can not only promote physical strength, enhance fertility, and relieve neurasthenia, but also has the effect of rejuvenation.

The only genuine testicular endocrine preparation is "Biocomplex," invented by Dr. Mellen of Germany, which is an effective medicine for treating premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, infertility after marriage, and neurasthenia. The rest are just using the name to attract attention. Dr. Flandin, a famous French doctor, conducted multiple tests on "Biocomplex" and proved that the seminal essence of animal testicles is most abundant in chimpanzees, and the nature of chimpanzees is most compatible with the human body. Therefore, the medicine has absolutely no side effects such as temporary excitement and irritation of the stomach and intestines. It is the most perfect preparation for promoting limb prosperity and rejuvenating. For women, "Biocomplex for Women" can be taken to regulate menstruation and beautify the complexion.

This chimpanzee is raised by Dr. Mellen, a German endocrine expert. Its children have all sacrificed their lives in the doctor's laboratory. It can be said that they are the crystallization of his love and have donated their bodies to improve human health. Therefore, governments around the world have issued orders prohibiting the export and hunting of apes and monkeys, fearing that they may become extinct in the long run.

### Conditions for Radical Cure of Lung Disease

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Because health knowledge is not popularized among Chinese people, most people contract lung disease as a result. Because this disease is extremely persistent, it has created a bad impression that lung disease is difficult to cure. In fact, this kind of wrong concept needs to be eliminated to avoid being captured by the disease demon. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as general doctors say, and on the contrary, lung disease can really be cured, as long as the treatment and health maintenance are in harmony, there is nothing mysterious. This is what I have gained from more than 20 years of experience. I always use "Bu Fei Na'er" to search for tuberculosis, nourish the lungs, relieve cough and eliminate phlegm, and fill the lung cavities. No matter if the disease has reached the second or third stage with hemoptysis, it can be absolutely cured by taking it. However, during the cure, it is advisable to be quiet, not to work, and to consume more nutritious foods. These are the necessary conditions for the cure of pulmonary tuberculosis.

Venereal Disease Lecture

### The Relationship Between Sexual Desire and Gonorrhea

— Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

Gonorrhea and Sexual Activity

Before gonorrhea is cured, the maintenance of health is not to be neglected. Among them, the maintenance of sexual desire is essential. It is necessary to pay attention to diet, labor, etc., because gonorrhea patients do not maintain health in these places and engage in excessive sexual activity. Then their resistance will inevitably be weakened, and the latent gonococci will inevitably take advantage of the patient's weakened resistance to wreak havoc. All kinds of complications arise from this. Therefore, maintaining health is the most important thing before gonorrhea is cured. I will reiterate it again, because gonococci are quite resistant, and their resistance in the human body is stronger than in a test tube. Therefore, even if the patient has a high fever of about 40 degrees, they can still maintain their survival. Based on this reason, the general internal medicine for gonorrhea that claims to be able to cure gonorrhea radically in three to five days is obviously based on facts and mostly fails. Moreover, a falsely self-cured disease that has not been cured will recur easily with a little negligence in health maintenance, such as sexual activity and alcoholism, causing endless troubles. It is important to pay attention!

Appropriate Treatment

I have always seen that when patients first get sick, they abuse inferior medicines that have not been introduced by doctors. Although they may get a little relief for a while, they often have sexual intercourse with their wives, resulting in mutual infection and permanent difficulty in curing. However, when I encounter this situation, I must instruct the sick couple to temporarily sleep in separate beds and treat them at the same time. I use German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy to remove the gonorrhea toxin, and I also prescribe the sacred medicine for gonorrhea, "Kelinong," to eliminate the widespread gonococci inside. It can be effective in a short period of time. If the wife has been infected, she can use "Ca'er Xuedi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, and also take "Kelinong," then the excellent effect will exceed our imagination. It is absolutely foolproof. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen every day, and each number will only cost five jiao.

### Talking About Freckle Preparations in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry Laboratory

— Zuihong

Freckles are a type of skin pigmentation. They are mostly a skin condition caused by nerve and blood vessel disorders. It can also be caused by applying inferior cosmetics containing lead. Generally, young girls who suffer from freckles occasionally run to the pharmacy to buy a bottle of freckle lotion. As a result, the freckles are not removed, but the face becomes red, swollen, painful, dry, and cracked. This is because the lotion contains mercury and acid-based drugs, but lacks sufficient emollients and soothing agents. Moreover, lotions are very easy to dry. When applied to the face, often before the medicinal properties arrive, the lotion has already dried up. At the same time, because of the drastic medicinal properties, the skin feels very painful. Therefore, freckle medicine is fundamentally unsuitable for making lotions. Then, can the various emerging miscellaneous brands of vanishing cream on the market treat freckles? Some people who have experience using vanishing cream can generally answer that. Vanishing cream is used every day. I ask, how much can freckles be removed? Experience is the answer. Facts speak louder than words. Vanishing cream is stearic acid and an alkaline compound. It only has the ability to whiten and moisturize. Some even lack glycerin, so the moisturizing ability has disappeared. Beauty and freckle removal are out of the question. Beauty and freckle removal must have beauty and freckle removal ingredients. It cannot be considered just by talking about it. Then, is the scientifically advanced beauty product "Mianli" that is popular on the market now also a vanishing cream? No! Absolutely not. The powder quality of "Mianli" is smooth, soft, and delicate, unlike vanishing cream, which is dry, greasy, and congealed. This indicates that "Mianli" has undergone a refining process and has been added with beauty ingredients and freckle-removing medicine. Moreover, after being spread on the palm, the powder quality can still be identified, unlike vanishing cream, which only has some water quality after being ground. This indicates that "Mianli" really has beauty and freckle-removing ingredients inside. Therefore, it can be said to be definitely effective. "Mianli" also has an extremely reliable guarantee, which is the pharmaceutical permit number 1298 from the Central Health Administration. The freckle-removing and beauty ingredients inside have been chemically tested. Of course, it is more reliable than our chemical tests. Therefore, talking about freckle preparations, I think "Mianli" is a very valuable special product. In terms of beauty contribution, it has created the most glorious page. This seems to be undeniable! The fragrance of "Mianli" previously had ABC types. Recently, a new type D fragrance has been released, which is quiet and fragrant, more lovely than the others, and the value is more noble than the others. It must be even more popular. The manufacturer of "Mianli" is the well-known Tongren Pharmacy in the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry. Major pharmacies and department stores are selling it.

Using inferior cosmetics every day will greatly harm your face.

Modern Medicine

### A New Understanding of Gonorrhea

— Described by Huang Zhongchang, MD, USA

"Gonorrhea is difficult to cure" is almost a universal cry, but in reality, people have no understanding of the truth of gonorrhea. They echo each other, so gonorrhea patients are always in a pessimistic atmosphere, allowing the hateful gonococci to spread and grow, causing all kinds of dangerous symptoms. This is because they have no new understanding of gonorrhea itself and are only limited to old concepts. Furthermore, they use outdated symptomatic treatment methods, such as claiming that it can be cured in three to five days, and newly released over-the-counter medicines on the market. In fact, their effectiveness is the same as the old, useless over-the-counter medicines. Originally, cunning and stubborn gonococci have strong infectivity and rich reproductive capacity, so general internal medicine and local surgery are ultimately difficult to achieve their full effect. It must have a therapy that surrounds the gonococci and directly kills them to be effective.

Based on the above reasons, Dr. Peter, a German master of gonorrhea, first invented "Kelinong," a drug synthesized from a mixture of protein and yellow pigment, based on the principle of non-specific gonorrhea toxin therapy. He used animal experiments, gradually improved it, and spent more than 30 years of research effort to finally achieve success. Regardless of new or old leucorrhea, just taking "Kelinong" for a few hours will produce its bactericidal effect in the blood, and each cell will also have an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect. Therefore, the inflammation and swelling caused by gonococci, the difficulty of urination, the various pains of the lymphatic system and lymph nodes, and the combination of pus and blood can be eliminated. It is effective to treat two or more complications of gonorrhea at the same time by taking "Kelinong." This is a unique effect of "Kelinong" and cannot be compared with other inferior medicines. It has been unanimously recognized by venereal disease specialists in hospitals in various countries as an effective drug for gonorrhea, so they have explained the process of the efficacy of this drug in major medical journals, which proves its excellent value. As for external medicine, according to my experience, "Kanglin Water" has a wonderful effect of complementing "Kelinong." Patients can wash the urethra at home according to the instructions of "Kanglin Water" to clear the gonococci on the mucous membrane. Women can use "Ca'er Xuedi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, so the gonococci and leucorrhea in the vagina can be swept away and cleared. The power is difficult to describe (Note: "Kanglin Water" is sold in both Chinese and Western Taihe Pharmacies)

### The Complete Story of a Young Man Recently Saved from Nocturnal Emission

— Zheng Ting, MD, Germany

The patient, Tang Yunzhang, resides at No. 22 Yongan Lane, Carter Road, this city. He is a business student, 21 years old. At the age of 18, he mistakenly committed masturbation and gradually became a habit. After a long time, he had frequent nocturnal emissions, muscle wasting, and a pale complexion. He was mentally depressed, lacked energy, and sometimes had tinnitus and headaches. He began to feel terrified, so he resolved to quit masturbation and then took various Chinese and Western medicines, hoping to nourish his losses and stop nocturnal emissions. He took three boxes of solid essence pills without effect. He then consulted a Chinese medicine practitioner to prescribe a prescription for nourishment, but there was no hope of radical cure. Fortunately, in the autumn of last year, he was introduced by a fellow patient to the Juyan Hospital for the latest electrotherapy, and he took the French "Nais Nocturnal Emission Tablets" for nocturnal emission, and also used the German "Biocomplex" to supplement it. In the first week, he felt comfortable sleeping and had fewer erotic dreams. Therefore, nocturnal emission stopped. In the second week, he was energetic, his appetite increased, he was energetic during the day, and he did not feel tired when working. In the fifth week of taking it, he gained four pounds, and all the symptoms were completely cured, he said.

### A Review and Prospect of China's Accounting Academic and Accounting Profession (Continued)

— Pan Xulun

(II)

After the National Government settled in the Southeast in 1927, and the country was unified in 1928, although civil wars still occurred sporadically, domestic construction gradually returned to normal. At that time, in the Southeast region, due to the abolition of likin and the reform of the tax system, the establishment of textile, cement, rubber, match, and other daily necessities industries gradually increased. In addition, the research on domestic commercial science became more widespread, and the opportunity for rationalized management became increasingly mature. Therefore, the improvement of industrial and commercial accounting was extremely significant. The popularization of accounting education greatly contributed to promoting this trend. Before 1927, the business courses of domestic universities and specialized schools used original English and American textbooks for bookkeeping and accounting, which were incompatible with China's accounting practices. The books published in the market were mainly about basic bookkeeping, and more advanced books were rarely seen. In the spring of 1928, the Lixin Accounting Tutoring School was established. In 1930, my book "Advanced Commercial Bookkeeping Textbook" was published. In 1933, two types of publications were created: the "Lixin Accounting Journal" edited by me and the "Accounting Magazine" edited by Xu Yongzuo. By 1936, the "Lixin Accounting Series" edited by me had published 30 types. The number of types of translations and publications by other publishers was also higher than in any previous period, and the establishment of accounting tutoring schools had spread throughout major cities in the country. Accounting education was popularized among accounting practitioners in general industrial and commercial enterprises, and the business of accountants became increasingly developed due to the increasing number of commercial affairs (as of recently, a total of 1,500 people have obtained accountant certificates, and there are already more than ten domestic accountant associations). Businessmen found it necessary to improve their accounting systems. Therefore, not only large-scale industrial and commercial enterprises improved their systems, but also smaller enterprises followed suit in large numbers. This situation reached its peak with the implementation of income tax collection in 1937.

According to Chinese laws and regulations, such as the General Rules for Merchants and the Company Law, there are provisions regarding the recording of books, the calculation of profits and losses, and the distribution of profits for commercial enterprises. However, before 1921, various enterprises failed to strictly implement these due to social customs. After 1927, the Civil Code and other important commercial laws were promulgated and amended successively, and enforcement became stricter, which had a significant impact on promoting accounting reform. In 1932, the business tax system was promulgated. Because the tax system used business turnover as the tax base, it seemed to have some impact on accounting improvement. As a result, the adoption of the contracted payment system for taxation did not "conflict" with the old habits of merchants. With the promulgation of the income tax system, the calculation of taxable income was based on actual profits and capital. Therefore, a good accounting system was not only necessary for operation and management, but also indispensable for fair taxation. As a result, accounting education became more widespread in local chambers of commerce and trade associations, and the business of accountants became increasingly developed. Students in universities, middle schools, and tutoring schools who were proficient in accounting found it as easy to find employment as civil engineering students were sought after when large-scale highways were being built. It is no exaggeration to call this the golden age of China's accounting academic and accounting profession. (To be continued)

As for whether the foreign embassies in Hankou have received the Japanese notification and its attached conditions, it was not possible to confirm definitively in this city last night.

### Details of the Forced Road Construction in the Pudong Japanese Naval Defense Zone

Many Civilian Houses Demolished Along the Road; Guard Posts Set Up Everywhere to Prevent Attacks

The Pudong Japanese Naval Defense Zone, listening to the advice of traitors, used the means of "controlling the Chinese with the Chinese" to force villagers in various places to participate in voluntary road construction or widening in order to facilitate the movement of the Japanese army and eliminate the threat of guerrillas. Since the beginning of this effort, hundreds of unarmed people have completed

Four Routes

under violent oppression.

According to on-site investigation yesterday: (1) The new road connecting No. 6 Bridge on Pudong Avenue to the original road of Qinci Yangdian starts from Qinci Yangdian straight south, passes through Laoya Ke, and reaches Zhangjia Lou. From the eastern end of Zhangjia Lou, it turns southwest and arrives at Qijia Miao (the entire line is five li long). (2) From Yangjing Xizha Kou, it goes straight south to Tangjia Nong, with a total length of

Three Li.

(3) From Zhangjia Lou, it goes straight west, passes through Xieao Di, makes a small turn, continues west, and passes through Lujia Zhai Bridge, Qianjia Xiang, and reaches Yangjia Du, with a total length of six li. (4) From Gongchang Zhan, it goes south, passes through Meiyuan Wangjia Bridge, and reaches Cao'an, with a total length of three li. All four lines mentioned above have been completed. Each line is 20 feet wide and can accommodate two armored vehicles or military trucks side by side. Because there were existing small roads to follow,

Civilian Houses Demolished

in a total of two places. (1) Two shop houses of villager Chen Linsheng at the entrance of Sanguan Tang in Ya Zha Tan, west of Lujia Shi Bridge. (2) Two noodle shop houses of Zhao Songlin opened at the north end of Lujia Shi Bridge. No compensation was paid for the owners' losses. In addition, the farmland occupied on both sides of the four roads is estimated to be around 100 mu. After the farmers' land was occupied, they were all

Heartbroken

Bearing the pain and swallowing their anger, they had no way to complain. After the four roads were forcibly built by the Japanese army, the sentries on the original Pudong Avenue have expanded southward. On Yangjing West Shi Street Road, three sentry posts have been added at Minsheng Road intersection, Qinci Yangdian, and Cao An, with sandbags piled up. At the southern end of the new road (four or five li south of Shi Street),

Additional Sentry Posts

have been set up at five locations: Tangjie Nong, San Zhuang Miao, Zhangjia Lou, Qijia Miao, and Xieao Di. Sandbags are piled up at each location, and two or three soldiers are stationed. Furthermore, a Marine Corps sub-unit has been set up at Chen Zhangrong's house in front of Qinci Yangdian, guarded by seventy or eighty sailors. A small squad unit has been set up at Zhao Zhangzhang's house at Lujia Zhai Bridge, with twenty or thirty soldiers. Zhangjia Lou is also a small squad unit, with twenty or thirty soldiers. Considering the sudden construction of defenses and the tension in the air in various places, it is clear that they are trying to prevent the actions of the Chinese army on the anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident. Their fear of the guerrillas can be seen from this.

### 1938 Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial Report (Continued)

(Worker's Livelihood Survey) Mr. Cai Zhengya, former chief of the Statistics Section of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, is now serving at the China Statistical Society, but has an office in the Industrial Section and is responsible for investigating workers' livelihoods and statistical work. His achievements have greatly benefited the Bureau. Therefore, the annual report of the Industrial Section for the past year contains important information about workers' livelihoods, which was not available in previous annual reports of the Industrial Section.

Judging from the results of the study of the cost of living in this city, one of the most noteworthy aspects is the decline in the purchasing power of money. In July 1937, what could be purchased with one yuan in national currency now requires one yuan and forty-seven cents in national currency. In other words, one yuan in national currency in July 1937 is now worth only sixty-eight cents.

The following sections are extracted from Mr. Cai's original report. Due to space limitations, the various tables referred to cannot be included.

(1) (Cost of Living Index and Retail Prices) The cost of living index for workers in this city started in 1926, and that year is used as the standard for comparison. The total index is divided into five categories: food, rent, clothing, fuel, and miscellaneous. The weight of each category can be roughly determined from the percentage of each category's expenditure in the average household. In the total expenditure, food accounts for 53.2%, with the expenditure on rice being the largest. Rent accounts for 8.3%, clothing 7.5%, fuel 6.4%, and miscellaneous 24.6%. (2) In 1937, the total index was 124.11, which was 18.15% higher than in 1936. If we compare the monthly index from August to December 1937 with July 1937 before the war, the increase is much more than this. During these five months, the highest total index was in November, which was 159.08, an increase of 45% compared with July (109.51). In other words, in the five months after August 13th, the cost of living increased sharply by half.

(3) Comparing 1938 with July 1937, the category index with the sharpest increase was rent, followed by fuel, then miscellaneous, then food, and clothing was the lowest. The annual index for the rent category in 1938 was 289.14, an increase of 156.9% compared with July before the war (112.56). The index from January to June was 276.72, and from July to December it was 301.56. The annual index for the fuel category was 242.59, an increase of 62.5% compared with July before the war (249.25). The monthly index was the lowest in May (214.48) and the highest in January (291.22). (To be continued)

### Gangsters of the Pseudo "Police Bureau" Collude with Japanese Rogues to Kidnap and Extort Money Without Regard to the Law; Falsely Accuse Xu Youhong of Being a Guerrilla to Extort a Huge Sum; Xu's Two Sisters are Also Kidnapped and Currently Imprisoned in the Japanese Headquarters

Jiang Genlin from Zhenjiang, Lin Guichun from Yangzhou, Chen Songbao, etc., from 4 PM on the 13th of this month to 8 PM on the 15th, used threats to extort 415 yuan in cash and a gold watch from Xu Youhong in Room 4 of the Beixin Hotel on West Station Road, Caotoutou, Jessfield Road. Xu reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and detectives Guan Huchen and Tie Guobin arrested Jiang and the other

three people

on the 17th in Room 207 of the Qinghe Hotel, Lane 108, Zhejiang Road, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. It is learned that Xu Youhong is 30 years old, from Yangzhou, and lives with his wife, Pang, at No. 81 Rongqing Li, Jessfield Road. His father used to run a restaurant in Fengtian, accumulating a huge fortune. Later, due to old age, he took his concubine and her two daughters, Guizhen (26 years old) and Xiuying (16 years old), to Shanghai for vacation. In July of this year, his father died, and Xu Youhong inherited this

huge inheritance

which he hid in his home, unexpectedly arousing the covetousness of his relatives, resulting in an unfortunate incident. At about 1 PM on the 13th of this month, more than ten people, including pseudo-police and "detectives" Xia Chao, Yang Qing, and Wang Rongshan from the pseudo "Police Bureau" of the "Da Dao Municipal Government," detective accomplices Yang Guisheng, and Japanese people, six of whom were carrying pistols, rushed into Xu's house, accusing Xu of being a guerrilla and conducting a large-scale search. At that time, Xu was out, so they drove away his wife and searched for a long time. Before leaving, they took Guizhen and Xiuying

two daughters

away. At the same time, the detective accomplice Chen Guisheng instructed the defendants to wait at the bus station at the intersection of Jessfield Road and Kaina Road. At about 4 PM, Xu Youhong arrived by bus and was forced at gunpoint to enter Room 4 of the Beixin Hotel, where he was imprisoned. The 25 yuan in legal tender (10 yuan was used for room expenses) and a gold watch that Xu was carrying were all confiscated, and a huge sum of money was demanded. Initially, they demanded 100,000 yuan, then reduced it to 50,000 yuan, and finally reduced it to 1,000 yuan. That night, he

was imprisoned

and Lin and Chen, along with four others, were responsible for guarding him. At the same time, people were sent to contact Xu's aunt, Chen Dama, and Old Yang, the owner of the Hongfa Barber Shop at the entrance of Xu's alley. In fact, Chen Dama and Old Yang were both accomplices. Chen Dama tricked Xu's wife, Pang, out of 390 yuan. The gang then declared to Xu on the 15th, "Your matter has been taken care of, and you can leave now. However, for your future peace of mind, Xu

must write a red note

and worship Luo Ziping, a translator working for the Japanese, as his master," etc. Xu had no choice but to agree and was released. However, he did not dare to return home and lived with relatives. All the property in his home had been searched and emptied. Unexpectedly, the defendants were still not satisfied and demanded that Xu pay 600 yuan to redeem his two sisters. They agreed to negotiate at the Qinghe Hotel, which led to Xu reporting the crime and being arrested. The police station, having learned the previous situation,

Japanese Headquarters

regarding the detention of Xu Guizhen and Xiuying. It was confirmed that this was the case. If they were found to be unrelated, they would be released. However, they were unaware of the defendants' extortion. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu opened the trial to interrogate them. Police lawyer Li Zhishan detailed the above situation. After the court questioned the defendants one by one, it ordered a postponement for further investigation.

### Gang of Thieves Uncovered in Continental Apartments, Bubbling Well Road

On the night of the 15th of this month at 12:00 AM, the French police uncovered a gang of pickpockets and purse snatchers in Shanghai in Rooms 224 and 226 of the Continental Apartments at 431 Bubbling Well Road. When they went to arrest them, the gang was gambling on Pai Gow and poker in Room 224, while people were smoking opium morphine in Room 226. They arrested 26 men and women, including Liu Shan, Wu Laisheng, Kong Bingren, Wang Zhongwen, Yang Jiren, and women Wu Peng, Yang Zhou, and Zhang Shen, and confiscated gambling tools, gambling money, opium morphine, and opium pipes. They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liao Yuan came to the First Criminal Court for a continued hearing. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer for the French Concession administration, presented the case and prosecuted according to law. After the court questioned the defendants in detail, it ordered a postponement for further interrogation. Those defendants whose crimes were more serious were ordered to be detained, while those whose crimes were minor were released on bail of 100 to 30 yuan and ordered to be available for questioning at any time.

### Abusing an Adopted Daughter, Fine Imposed; Lian Zhen Handed Over to the Benevolent Children's Society

Liang Bei, a woman from Suzhou (age 46), residing at No. 6, Lane 363, Gordon Road, recently abused her 11-year-old adopted daughter, Lian Zhen, who is from Liyang, by frequently beating her. The other day, a neighbor reported this in a letter to the Chinese Benevolent Children's Association on Hart Road. The association sent representative investigator Liu Wenlin to rush to the address. Upon investigation, it was found that Liang Lianzhen had several severe beatings on her legs and back, with obvious bruising. This was reported to the Gordon Road Police Station in charge, and detectives were dispatched to bring Liang Bei and the girl Lian Zhen to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday at 9:00 a.m. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and prosecuted her for abuse, requesting that Lian Zhen be sent to the Chinese Benevolent Children's Association for care because she did not want to return home. Subsequently, representatives from the Benevolent Children's Association, Liu Wenlin, and the girl Lian Zhen provided evidence. When questioned, Liang Bei's statements were evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi sentenced Liang Bei to a fine of one hundred yuan, or to replace it with forced labor, calculated at two yuan per day. The girl Lian Zhen was temporarily sent to the Chinese Benevolent Children's Association for care.

### Southern Hotel Shareholder Imprisoned and Extorted; Dismissed Chinese Detective Goes to Collect the Money; Police Arrest Him; Accomplices Being Pursued for Further Interrogation

Wang Zhancheng, from Chongming, engages in the miscellaneous grain business and travels between Kan and Chong. Wang also invested capital in the Southern Hotel at No. 462 Jiujiang Road in Shanghai. Therefore, he always stays at that hotel when he comes to Shanghai. Recently, Wang came to Shanghai again for business and stayed at the Southern Hotel. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 23rd of the month, three people suddenly went to Room 112 of the Southern Hotel. One of them was Wang's fellow villager. That person invited Wang to his

room to chat.

Wang, thinking they were fellow villagers, did not suspect anything. During the conversation, the three suddenly accused Wang of being a member of the Chinese guerrillas, saying that if he did not pay a large sum of money, they would send him to the Japanese military headquarters, where his life would not be spared. At the same time, they hired a car and forced Wang into it, taking him to a house in an alley at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Sichuan Road, where he was imprisoned.

Extorted 10,000 Yuan

If he refused, they would immediately send him to the Japanese military headquarters. Wang Zhancheng, although he had no connection with the guerrillas, knew that once he reached the Japanese military headquarters, it would be difficult to explain. Therefore, he had to yield. But he told them that he only brought 600 yuan with him on this trip to Shanghai, and it would be difficult to comply with the amount of 10,000 yuan. After several hours of negotiation, they agreed to settle for 600 yuan, with Wang entrusting

the Southern Hotel

tea servant Zhou Wenbin to first withdraw 200 yuan from his deposit at the hotel's accounting room and hand it over. The remaining amount was scheduled to be paid at the Southern Hotel the day before yesterday (the 24th) between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. (only then would he regain his freedom). Afterwards, Wang, feeling resentful at being defrauded for no reason, reported the information to the Zhabei Police Station. As expected, the day before yesterday at 6:00 p.m., Zhu Huimin, a dismissed Chinese detective from Xuzhou, representing these extortionists, came to collect the remaining 400 yuan. He was

arrested

by Zhabei Police detective Zhang Keqin.

Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Xiao Fen and Clerk Zhou Jing'an took their seats for interrogation. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for extortion and fraud under Article 346 of the Criminal Law, and requested a postponement for further interrogation as the accomplices still needed to be apprehended. After the court questioned the defendant, Zhu was ordered to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.

### Three Suicide Attempts; Woman Dies from Swallowing Opium

Wu Zhang, a middle-aged woman, 33 years old, residing at No. 77, Hong'an Lane, Haining Road, for unknown reasons, conceived the idea of death. Yesterday morning at 10:15 a.m., she secretly swallowed raw opium and committed suicide. She was discovered by her family, who rushed her to Renji Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and she died around 6:00 p.m.

Chen Guozhen, a 27-year-old man residing at a certain address in Jiangjia Lane, Connaught Road, had a quarrel due to trivial family matters. Afterwards, he was depressed. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 a.m., he stabbed his throat with scissors, causing continuous bleeding. He was immediately taken by his family to the Ji Hospital for treatment.

Chen Zha Xiang, a 20-year-old girl residing at No. 135, Baker Road, swallowed raw opium and committed suicide at 7:08 p.m. last night. After being discovered, she was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment and was reported to be out of danger.

### Japanese Ronin and Three Chinese Rob Hotel Guests

Accused Guest of Being a Guerrilla, Tied Him Up and Searched for Money; Japanese Arrested and Handed Over to Japanese Authorities for Punishment

According to Continental News, a certain Japanese person, falsely posing as a member of the Japanese Special Service Department, along with three Chinese people, committed robbery in a hotel on the Nanjing Road side at 1:00 a.m. yesterday (the 24th). The Japanese person has been arrested by the police, but the three Chinese accomplices have managed to escape. The victim was a certain traveler in the hotel. Yesterday morning, four men in plain clothes suddenly entered his room, accused the traveler of being a guerrilla, tied him up, and searched for his money. They left the traveler in the room and went out, spending freely. When their pockets were empty, they returned and ordered a lavish breakfast in the traveler's room, paying for it with a watch they had stolen. At the same time, the robbed traveler managed to persuade the four bandits to let him go to the toilet. He left a message on the wall, saying that he was being held in the room and asked the manager to call the police. After the traveler returned to the room, the bandits did not tie him up again. Soon after, a tea servant entered the toilet and saw the message. However, the tea servant was also captured and beaten by the four. The robbed traveler then took advantage of the bandits' attack on the tea servant to sneak downstairs and report to the accounting room, who then called the police and arrested the Japanese person. During interrogation, the Japanese person admitted that he had no connection with the Special Service Department. Yesterday, the Police Department handed the Japanese person over to the Japanese authorities in this port, and it is said that he will be charged with robbery.

### Bandits Lurk in the Dark and Shoot at Night Patrol Detectives; Russian Woman Shot While Shouting for a Thief; Robbers Arrested in Siming Lane

The Jing'an Temple Police Department, considering the recent robberies occurring frequently in the western suburbs of Shanghai, in addition to instructing all detectives to be extra vigilant, also dispatched special night patrols and extra patrols every night to ensure the safety of the neighborhood. Unexpectedly, near midnight the day before yesterday, while several patrol detectives were patrolling on Dunxin Road in the western suburbs of Shanghai, a gunshot suddenly rang out from the dark bushes on the border, seemingly aimed at the detectives. A black shadow was seen rushing into the Chinese territory after the gunshot and disappearing. The detectives, lacking concrete evidence, did not fire back. They searched the vicinity of the border but found nothing, and reported the situation to the police station, leaving the case pending investigation.

Russian Woman Shot

Near Bailinan Road, west of the Fanhuan渡 Station in the western suburbs of Shanghai, at around 8:40 p.m. the night before yesterday, a Russian couple was walking there when they encountered three robbers who stopped them. The Russian woman, in a moment of urgency, shouted for help, which offended the bandits. They fired a shot at the woman and fled into the darkness. The Russian woman was unable to dodge and was shot in the chest, falling to the ground in pain. Her husband managed to hire a car to take her to Hong'en Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the police station to apprehend the criminals.

Business Firm Robbed

In a certain business firm at No. 419 Guangdong Road, at around 7:15 p.m. yesterday evening, three robbers suddenly disguised themselves as customers and went to commit robbery. Two robbers armed with guns entered the shop and held the accountants and shop assistants captive, forbidding them to make any noise. The remaining accomplices went inside to search, but there was no large sum of money in the cash register. They only managed to steal a sealed envelope containing one hundred yuan in paper money and fled. Afterwards, the shop owner reported the robbery to the police.

Boatman Shot

Fang Yimao, a 22-year-old boatman from Chongming, was fully loaded with yellow sand from his hometown and came to Shanghai to sell it. While sailing midway, he suddenly encountered a pirate ship that ordered him to stop. Fang was unwilling to show weakness and resisted bravely. As a result, the pirates fired several shots, hitting him severely in the chest. All the clothes and belongings on the boat were looted, and they left. It was not until 6:30 p.m. last night that he arrived here and sought treatment at Tongren Hospital.

Robbers Arrested

Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 p.m., four robbers went to No. 27, Siming Lane, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lubin in the French Concession, to commit robbery. One robber, holding a gun, stood guard at the gate, while three robbers went upstairs into the room and intimidated the homeowner's family, forbidding them to make any noise. Just as they were ransacking the boxes and chests, the police headquarters of the Lu家湾 French Concession received a report and immediately dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives, who rushed to encircle the area in police vehicles. The robber standing guard, seeing the arrival of the Chinese and foreign detectives, panicked and threw the gun he was holding into a coal basket in the homeowner's courtyard and fled. He was captured by the detectives. At the same time, the Chinese and foreign detectives rushed upstairs. The three robbers who were searching were unarmed and, seeing the Chinese and foreign detectives descending like generals from the sky, were terrified and surrendered. The detectives then found a gun in the coal basket and took it back to the police station along with the robbers for investigation and referral to the court for trial. The homeowner's family suffered no loss, which was fortunate.

### Conclusion of the Bullet Gift Case; Defendant Acquitted

Ji Xiaofeng and Wang Yigong Had a Grudge; Zhang Refused to Give False Testimony, Leading to False Accusation

Ji Xiaofeng, who worked as a lawyer's broker, recently became involved in a lawsuit on behalf of some shareholders of the Hengsheng Shipping Company, which had already ceased operations, against other shareholders. Wang Yigong, the manager of the Queen's Theater, assisted the opposing party in the lawsuit, leading Ji and Wang to become enemies. On the 3rd of this month, Ji suddenly reported to the police station in charge, saying that someone had sent

a box of cakes

to his house that morning, containing five bullets. At the time, Ji was unable to identify who sent the item, so he was told to wait for further investigation. After a week, Ji reported again, saying that a tailor who witnessed the delivery that day said it was Zhang Guohua, an employee of the Queen's Theater. The head of the police then dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest Zhang and bring him to the First Special District District Court for questioning and detention. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai opened the Fourth Criminal Court for continued hearing. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the defendant

had previously denied

sending the cake to Ji's house. Although the police had repeatedly investigated, he still firmly denied it. Ji Xiaofeng then recounted the incident. When questioned, the defendant said that he did not know Ji and that Ji had come to his house several times because of the ongoing intimidation case in the French Concession court, asking me to give false testimony in court in exchange for a large sum of money. I refused, fearing that he would harm me. I rejected him, etc. He also hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. As a result, the court ruled that Zhang Guohua was not guilty.

### Unscrupulous Merchants Manufacture Counterfeit Cigarettes

Gang Uncovered, More Than Ten Male and Female Criminals Arrested; Main Culprit Wang Zhanmei Being Pursued for Joint Punishment

The cigarettes sold in the occupied areas along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways are mostly counterfeit cigarettes of various well-known brands secretly manufactured in Shanghai by unscrupulous merchants and transported for sale. The cigarette boxes for these counterfeit cigarettes are collected from various cigarette paper shops, so the appearance is no different from the real ones. Recently, the police have repeatedly uncovered

counterfeit gangs,

but this kind of business is extremely profitable, so they rise again and again, making it difficult to eliminate them. Last month, No. 11, Lane 107, Parker Road, produced a branch of the French-owned Parisian Tobacco Company. Its manufacturing plant was set up at No. 7, Lane 90, Chihama Road, and a large number of female workers were recruited. Those who did not know thought it was a newly emerging formal company, but in fact, it was all counterfeiting the products of major Chinese and foreign tobacco companies. After the police department in charge secretly verified the facts, they first went to

the branch

and arrested Weng A'chang, Wang Jinrong, Xu Heshang, Li Kunyuan, and Zhao Chen, who were packaging cigarettes. Then they went to the manufacturing plant and arrested Qian Sheng, Zhang Baoqing, Shen Dingkang, Lin Haigen, Yu Wei, Li Guixiang, Wu Baodi, Zhou Meiyue, Chen Xingyue, Zhu Meiqing, Zhang A'e, and a total of sixteen people, seizing manufacturing machines, tobacco leaves, various brands of manufactured cigarettes, account books, receipts, and the carved wooden seal of the fake "Consolidated Tax Bureau." According to Weng and others, the owner's name is Wang Zhanmei, and he lives at No. 11, Dade Lane, Chengdu Road. When the detectives went to arrest him, he had already

fled upon hearing the news.

Yesterday morning, the arrested men and women were escorted to the First Special District District Court for interrogation. Police lawyer Qian Xunwan explained the process of solving the case and requested an adjournment for further investigation to apprehend the main culprit for joint punishment. Judge Dai then interrogated the defendants, all of whom admitted that they were hired by Wang to manufacture counterfeit cigarettes. However, Yu Wei also stated that she was Wang's mistress. Wang had been unemployed since the war and started this business with a friend, with the capital being raised by pawning clothes. Judge Dai, upon obtaining the confession, ordered the defendants to be detained separately for further interrogation at a later date.

### Trafficking in Human Beings; Reported to the Police and Arrested

Xiao Lang, the ten-year-old daughter of Xu Luting, an Yixing native residing at No. 6, Hongzhang Lane, Gordon Road, disappeared while playing at the door at noon on November 14th of last year. The police were notified to search, but no trace was found. It was not until about 11:00 p.m. the day before yesterday that the girl was abandoned crying in front of the Great World in the French Concession. Someone asked the girl about her address and sent her back. Her father, Xu Luting, asked the girl and learned that she had been abducted and sold by Chen Xu, a fellow villager residing at the refugee camp on Connaught Road, to a certain place as an adopted daughter. She had recently contracted lung disease and was abandoned near the Great World, etc. Based on the information, he reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, who sent detectives to arrest Chen. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the process. Judge Jiang Shuzi, after questioning her, ordered her to be detained for sentencing.

### Postal Service Restored; Hunan Province Postal Money Orders

Acceptance of Small Package Mail to Various Provinces; Regulations on the Mailing of Official Documents and Attachments

The Shanghai Postal Administration recently received a fast telegram from the Hunan Postal Administration, ordering the temporary suspension of the opening of money orders. Yesterday, the bureau received another telegram from the Hunan Administration clarifying that the previous telegram was issued after the Changsha fire, when the situation in the province was chaotic, and was no longer applicable. Money orders throughout the province could now be opened and paid as usual. Therefore, the Shanghai Administration resumed postal money orders to Hunan from today. The maximum amount for money orders opened in Shanghai to places like Changsha in Hunan is 5,000 yuan, without the need to add additional fees. Other inland areas are subject to restrictions and a small supplementary fee. According to the Shanghai Administration, Guangzhou money orders have also been restored, but the maximum amount is limited to 50 yuan, with an additional supplementary fee of 15 cents per yuan. Apart from Guangzhou, only Shantou in the province can handle money orders, with a maximum amount of 200 yuan and a supplementary fee of 8 cents per yuan.

Small Package Mail

The joint sealing and distribution group for small package mail of the Shanghai Postal Administration previously announced the suspension of accepting small package mail to various places due to traffic congestion and transportation difficulties. Now that transportation is slightly better, a notice was issued yesterday stating that from today, all types of small package mail to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces can be accepted again. However, small package mail to Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces must not exceed one kilogram per package. This is hereby notified. According to inquiries, the limit for each item to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan is five kilograms, with a mailing fee of two yuan per kilogram. For Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan, the limit is one kilogram per item, with a mailing fee of three yuan per kilogram.

Official Document Attachments

Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1525 states: "Upon investigation, when various agencies mail official documents and attachments, if the official document and attachments are sealed together, the entire package should be charged as a letter according to regulations. If the official document and attachments are sealed separately but mailed at the same time, they must be tied together, but the official document must be charged as a letter and the attachments must be charged as small package mail, so that they can be delivered together by express delivery. However, in order to save postage, some senders also mail the attachments separately as printed matter. Currently, due to transportation difficulties in various places, the post office has to give priority to shipping light items such as letters and postcards, while heavy items such as printed matter are accumulated and sent later. This makes it inevitable that official document attachments cannot arrive at the same time as the official documents, causing great inconvenience in handling official business. To remedy this, if the sender insists on mailing the official document attachments as printed matter, it is best to send them as express printed matter and add the motor vehicle transportation loss fee (see this Bureau's Notice No. 1522 of December 8, 27), so that the attachments and official documents can arrive at the same time, so as not to hinder official business. This is hereby notified to all. This notice is issued by Director Zha Peilin on January 21, 28th year of the Republic of China."

The Wu Hua Xiang (Five Fragrance) product factory in Baoyu Lane, Chengdu Road, was founded by the Ningbo-籍 merchant Wang Weikang. Its Wu Hua (Five Flowers) brand musk essence cream is widely sold and has a history of ten years. It was registered with the Trademark Bureau in the 18th year of the Republic of China, prohibiting counterfeiting. It has now been discovered that the Linlin Industrial Company opened by Luo Chengquan at No. 85 Mol坊 Street in the French Concession produces and sells counterfeit Wu Hua brand products in the market. The Wu Hua factory hired lawyer Xu Wufang as a representative to report to the French police, who went to the Linlin Industrial Company and seized more than 200 dozen counterfeit products and more than 1,000 fake trademark papers. Luo Chengquan was escorted to the Second Special District Court for legal action. The Wu Hua factory filed an incidental civil lawsuit to recover losses. Judge Wu Kechou has concluded the trial and recently ruled that the defendant be fined 60 yuan and the seized counterfeit goods be confiscated. The incidental civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court for trial. The defendant provided a security deposit of 300 yuan. The civil part will also be heard in court soon.

### Catering to Lower-Level Readers, Numbing the People, Spreading Obscene Content, Shanghai Newspaper Fined 300 Yuan

Recently, various small newspapers in Shanghai have competed to publish obscene content related to morals in order to gain the favor of general lower-level readers and seek to expand their sales. This situation is actually harmful to social morality. The Public Concession Police Authority intends to ban it. The "Shanghai News" at No. 36, Meiren Lane, Hankou Road, continuously published the erotic novel "The Upside-Down Phoenix's Sensual Shadows" on the 8th and 9th of the month. The language inside involved many obscene elements. After being investigated by Chinese Detective Zhang Yi of the Political Department, he reported to the Legal Department. Lawyers Wang Yaotang and Zhang Shizhu, representing the Municipal Council, filed a public prosecution against Kuang Menghuai, the owner of the newspaper, in the First Special District Court under Article 235 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Fang Qinghuan summoned him in the Fourth Criminal Court yesterday morning, the court, believing that severe punishment was necessary to serve as a warning and rectify social morals, sentenced Kuang Menghuai to a fine of 300 yuan for continuously disseminating obscene content, or to replace it with forced labor, calculated at three yuan per day.

### Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Provides Relief to War-Affected Students: Establishes Self-Study Tutoring and Temporary School Measures

(Huaiyin Dispatch) The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has established two measures for primary and secondary school students in war-affected areas who have lost access to education: self-study tutoring groups and temporary tutoring schools. In addition to submitting these measures to the Ministry of Education for record, it has also instructed local educational administrative authorities in guerrilla zones of various counties to comply with them.

The school recently formulated regulations on the treatment of full-time teachers and automatically established measures for labor accumulation funds, retirement funds, funeral expenses, and death benefits, providing a minimum guarantee for elementary school teachers in their service. The important ones are Article 4: "Full-time teachers will receive a salary increase of two yuan for each year of service"; Article 5: "Full-time teachers who have served at the school for five years will be entitled to six months of labor performance based on their salary for the last month, twelve months for ten years, and eighteen months for fifteen years"; Article 6: "The retirement period is twenty years.

School Overview

### Jiaotong Model Primary and Secondary School

Since the outbreak of the war, the population of Shanghai has increased dramatically, and schools in the interior have been destroyed in the war. There are undoubtedly many young people who have lost their access to education and have come to Shanghai. How to relieve these out-of-school students and how to cultivate these promising young people is a serious problem that needs to be solved urgently. Graduates of Jiaotong University who stayed in Shanghai saw this and joined forces to open the Jiaotong Model Summer Remedial School last summer (summer of 1938). More than 300 students came to study, which was very prosperous. Many of those who applied to Jiaotong University and other famous universities in China were admitted and the results were outstanding. Therefore, it was well received. Many people in the community encouraged them to continue to run a permanent school. Mr. Yang Junyi was concerned about education and generously donated the start-up fee of 10,000 yuan. Prominent figures such as Lin Kanghou, Cai Chang, Lian Sheng, Hai Shengtong, etc., served as school directors. Thus, the organizers of the summer school opened the Jiaotong Model Primary and Secondary School at the intersection of Ximo Road and Jing'an Temple Road. Tang Xianwu served as the principal. All the teachers are outstanding students from previous sessions of Jiaotong University, and most of them are graduates of Nanyang Model Middle School. Naming it Jiaotong Model Primary and Secondary School has a reason. Lin Kanghou was originally a school director of Nanyang Model Primary and Secondary School, and Shen Tongyi was the principal of Nanyang Model Middle School. He has a very deep relationship with Tang Principal and most teachers of Jiaotong Model Primary and Secondary School. Therefore, he has given much support to the school's facilities and planning. The school especially focuses on science, mathematics, and business subjects in order to cultivate talents for research in the science and engineering departments of universities and to train those engaged in banking and public transportation industries. The curriculum is rigorous, classes are held all day, management is meticulous, and the order is well maintained. The classes that have already been opened include the sixth grade of elementary school, all grades of junior high school, and the first and second grades of senior high school. For the past six months, the teaching results have been excellent. It has now been registered in accordance with the law and is planning to expand the school buildings to accommodate more students. With its sound teaching staff, serious teaching, dedicated leadership, and enthusiastic support from the community, its future is undoubtedly limitless. It is heard that there are still vacancies in each grade of the school, and it will hold enrollment during the winter vacation. Those who aspire to study science and engineering in the future and want to lay a good foundation in middle school, this school is truly an ideal middle school. In addition, parents who hope that their children will be engaged in banking and public transportation industries after graduating from middle school can also send their children to apply for the school, because the school's business subjects are very complete, and the teaching of major courses such as Chinese, English, and mathematics in all grades of middle school is particularly insightful and serious.

### Saigon Tennis Championship: Xu Chengji Did Not Participate, Hong Kong Players All Eliminated

(Hong Kong Dispatch) The Far East Tennis Championship has already begun in Saigon. All the Hong Kong players have been eliminated. In singles, Cai Yongshan lost to Hong (Annan) with a score of 2-6, 1-6, 6-1, 1-6; Situ Bi lost to Peterle (France) with a score of 0-6, 0-6, 1-6.

It is said that many good players participated in this competition, the most famous of which is Peterle. He is not only the French champion this year, but also the champion of Bacheng, Siam, and Annan. Mao Weidi, the former Belgian second-group champion, is also a good player, but his backhand stroke is slightly weaker. He and Peterle have a high chance of winning the doubles championship. It was previously said that Xu Chengji, a Chinese Davis Cup tennis player, would participate in the competition, but this did not happen.

This competition uses hard courts and is held at night. The players have to run and fight under the lights. Hong Kong players who are not used to hard courts feel even more inconvenient under these strong lights that cannot shine far.

Philippine players Gavia and Shanzhasi, who had performed in Hong Kong once before, did not receive good reviews, but this time in Saigon, because they are used to hard courts, they got off to a good start and defeated Annan's Geshalu and Chuan E with a score of 8-6, 6-1, 6-1.

Business News

### Finance: Tianjin Merchants Search and Seize, Cash Prices Surge, Highest Price at 2030 Yuan

Yesterday, the black market for cash suddenly surged under the influence of strong buying sentiment. The market situation returned to chaos, with prices rising to a peak of 2,030 yuan. This was mainly because foreign exchange was tightening due to the competition among British and American tobacco companies and various oil companies, which strengthened market sentiment. Despite the Ministry of Finance's order to the Silver and Money Trade Association not to prohibit the purchase of gold, those holding spot goods hoarded them. The Tianjin merchants, who had been quiet for a long time, heard that gold prices were high in their area, so they entrusted a certain money exchange business to search and purchase everywhere, with orders exceeding 700 taels. Speculators also actively absorbed gold. At the same time, the bond traders followed suit because of the sharp decline in public bonds. Although the silver shop merchants, money exchange businesses, and cash houses repeatedly tried to lower prices and sell, the supply and demand remained significantly different. As a result, the price ultimately rose by 18 yuan. However, there were slight fluctuations in the middle, but no major waves. Market sentiment was strong and bullish, and transactions were very active, totaling 920 taels. The price of silver jewelry also rose twice. The prices of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Cash Rose by 18 Yuan

The price of each bar (10 taels) rose slightly in the morning due to the influx of buyers. Initially, a silver shop merchant sold 10 taels to a money exchange business at a price of 2,011 yuan, then another silver shop sold 10 taels to a cash house at the same price, and then another 20 taels to another cash house at 12 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange business suddenly made a large purchase on behalf of the Tianjin merchants, and at the same time, bond traders followed suit, so the market price continued to rise. A certain money exchange business bought 100 taels from a silver shop merchant, all at a price of 14 yuan, and a certain customer merchant also bought 50 taels from a silver shop merchant at the same price. A certain money exchange business then bought 50 taels from a fellow business at 15 yuan, and a bond trader bought 50 taels from a silver shop merchant at 16 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought another 50 taels from a fellow business at 14 yuan. During this time, foreign exchange was tightening due to the competition among British and American tobacco companies and oil companies, so the market price rose again. A bond trader bought 50 taels from a silver shop merchant at 15 yuan, and the same price was offered by a silver shop merchant selling 50 taels to a money exchange business. Then, a certain money exchange business bought another 50 taels from a fellow business at 16 yuan, and the silver shop merchants traded 20 taels with each other at 18 yuan. Finally, the silver shop merchants traded 50 taels with each other at 20 yuan as the midday closing price. It was reported that after the close, money exchange businesses were trading at 21 yuan. Although there was no foreign exchange market in the afternoon on Wednesday, a certain money exchange business was even more intent on purchasing on behalf of the Tianjin merchants, and sellers were hoarding goods and only willing to supply at higher prices, so the price rose sharply. Initially, a certain money exchange business bought 50 taels from a silver shop merchant at 23 yuan, then another 50 taels from a silver shop merchant at 25 yuan, and then 100 taels from a fellow business at 27 yuan. Money exchange businesses traded 50 taels with each other at 30 yuan as the highest price. After that, because a certain money exchange business stopped absorbing, and silver shop merchants took the opportunity to sell at high prices, the price fell slightly. A silver shop merchant sold 30 taels to a money exchange business at 27 yuan, and the silver shop merchants traded 50 taels with each other at 26 yuan. Finally, a gold house sold 50 taels to a silver shop merchant at 2,027 yuan as the evening closing price, which was up 18 yuan from the previous day. It was heard that someone was selling at 25 yuan after the close, but because buyers had no appetite, no transactions were made. (A range of 19 yuan for the whole day.) The listed price of gold at the cash house was 2,035 yuan for selling and 1,020 yuan for buying, but there were no transactions.

Silver Jewelry Prices Increased Twice

The initial selling prices of silver jewelry in silver shops did not change. However, around 11:50 AM, as the cash price approached 2,020 yuan, the price was increased by one yuan. Later, after the cash price rose to a peak of 30 yuan, the price was increased by another yuan. Da Tong Heng and Lao Qing Yun all listed 206 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng listed 204 yuan, buying in at 198 yuan.

British Pure Gold Unchanged for Two Days

According to a London dispatch on the 24th, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged at £7 8s 8.5d per ounce. The Shanghai Central Bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold also remained unchanged at 1,213.9 yuan. The listed price of customs gold remained unchanged at 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 9 li. The Shanghai Standard Gold price also remained unchanged at 1,209.2 yuan.

### As the Lunar New Year Approaches, Copper Coins are Hoarded: Signs were Already Seen Yesterday

Every year as the Lunar New Year approaches, the exchange rate of copper coins is inevitably manipulated, creating a phenomenon of a very short exchange rate, which gradually returns to normal after the Lunar New Year. Since the implementation of the one-cent legal tender, this trend has been somewhat curbed. Unexpectedly, signs of this have been seen recently. This is because a large number of old copper coins have been purchased by money houses and transferred to the Japanese to manufacture munitions. The number of old copper coins on the market has suddenly decreased, and the copper coins that are available also contain more lead impurities. As a result, the exchange rate of copper coins, which could previously be 3,000 coins or more, has become 3,000 coins per Customs tael. Yesterday, many tobacco and exchange shops in the Western District went to exchange copper coins at 10 AM, but they were all rejected. They were given five-yuan banknotes and were only allowed to exchange five one-yuan banknotes. Most stores had no copper coins to exchange and only had signs saying "Exchange at 9 jiao 9 fen for legal tender". Later, some exchanges started, with exchange rates of 2,940, 2,950, or 2,970, while some still only exchanged for jiao coins. How this will evolve remains to be seen.

### Dalian Gold Price Rises, Foreign Currencies Also Rise

Yesterday, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies fell by 125. The settlement of foreign exchange at foreign exchange banks was very active, and the supply of foreign telegrams was not smooth, so the market price gradually decreased and tended to weaken. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday. The cash price rose sharply again due to the weakness of the foreign exchange market. Tianjin merchants frequently searched and purchased, and although retail investors sold for profit, it was difficult to satisfy the demand. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price in Dalian was more expensive than in Shanghai, and those who had previously sold had to buy back, so market sentiment was boosted, and everyone rushed to buy. There was no market for foreign exchange bills in the afternoon, and ordinary transactions were rare. After this news spread, the market soared, and sellers were hard to find. The market price was unusually firm. Due to the weakness of foreign exchange and the sharp rise in cash prices, foreign currencies rose sharply. Retail transactions were not active, and transactions in the association were extremely rare. Only Chengtai sold US dollar notes worth 1,000 yuan, which were purchased by Litong. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds each rose by 2 jiao, British gold notes rose by 1 jiao 8 fen, US dollar notes rose by 4 fen, Hong Kong notes rose by 1 fen 5 li, French franc notes rose by 1 li, Singapore and Dutch notes each rose by 3 fen, Robbie and Canadian notes each rose by 2 fen, and Philippine notes rose by 1 fen. Only Annan, Italian, German gold, Australian gold, and Siamese notes remained unchanged.

### Discount Rate Remains Fixed

Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange drafts and bills remained unchanged. The discount rate per thousand yuan remained above 35 yuan, and the final price was 35 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen, which was still similar to the previous day.

### Long-Term Silver Prices Rise

According to a London dispatch on the 24th, speculators bought and sold, and those who bought were satisfied, so transactions were limited, and the market was stable. After the close, the market was slightly dull, but a few sold at the listed price. The near-term price of large silver bars rose by 0.0625, and the long-term price rose by 0.125. According to a New York silver telegram, the price of American silver remained fixed. According to a Bombay silver telegram, the Indian silver market was calm, and spot prices rose by 1 anna, while near-term and long-term prices did not change.

### Securities: Market Sentiment Weak, Domestic Bonds Plummet, Foreign Bonds Stable

The black market for securities suddenly experienced an unexpected decline yesterday. The severity of the process was not as dramatic as on the 16th of this month, but the lowest price broke the minimum price of the 16th. Rumors arose in the market, with various and unverified reports. Because of the unfavorable environment, rumors took advantage of the situation. Some said that there were new reforms to the interest rate issue, but this was just speculation, and it was unlikely that the orders would change so frequently. Others said that public bonds were sold to buy cotton yarn, but the scope should not have been so large. The most plausible reason was that on the 10th, a certain bank sold a large number of bonds, which were said to be spot goods with expiring coupons. This caused extreme panic among retail investors. However, this was only a temporary phenomenon. Observing the environment, after the initial determination of this new reform, the situation in Europe suddenly became urgent, and there was a sense of impending crisis. In the face of this turbulent situation, public bonds, even if they rebounded, would have difficulty stabilizing. Yesterday, the opening prices were slightly lower by half a yuan. Because the 10th was selling, retail investors followed suit, and the decline could not be stopped. De Fu Hao also had a considerable sell-off, and the selling sentiment seemed to be unstoppable. In the afternoon, the selling sentiment of the 10th was indeed active, and the market was filled with selling sounds. The decline was even more severe, falling by about 1.5 yuan, and the lowest price of this month was discovered. Near the close, the selling by the 10th subsided slightly, and a certain large investor took advantage of the low prices to absorb, so the price rebounded by several jiao to about 1 yuan. The future situation is still difficult to be optimistic about. Whether the 10th has sold out its spot goods and whether it can arouse the interest of the general public to buy more are still in doubt. As a result, the price continued to fall by 1.35 yuan to 1.75 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be over 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading was as dull as usual. There were many inquiries but few successful transactions. Only a few dozen shares of Ning Shao Company stock were traded at a price of 8 yuan 05 fen, which was slightly better than before by 1 jiao 2 jiao.

The listed prices of London Chinese foreign bonds on the 24th of this month (Tuesday) were stable and unchanged, but they were still in a state of having prices but no market. British merchants were still inquiring about the supply and demand of physical goods. A total of 3,000 pounds of British Boxer Indemnity Bonds were sold at a price of 50 pounds, which was 0.5 pounds higher than the market price. Another 2,000 pounds were sold at a price of 49 pounds 15 shillings, which was 5 shillings higher than the market price. Buyers also had an appetite for 2,000 to 5,000 pounds of this bond, but the price would depend on the seller's offer. 2,000 to 5,000 pounds of French bonds with prints were sold at a price of 47 pounds, which was 15 shillings higher than last week. 2,000 to 5,000 pounds of German bonds with prints were sold at a price of 45 pounds 5 shillings, which was 5 shillings lower than the previous day. 5,000 pounds of Sino-French-American 5% Gold Bonds with prints (i.e., 25,000 US dollars) were sold at a price of 69 pounds 5 shillings. Another 10,000 US dollars (i.e., 2,000 British pounds) were sold at a price of 65 US dollars 37.5 cents, or 69 British pounds 15 shillings, which was 5 shillings to 15 shillings higher than the market price. There were also 2,000 pounds of Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds originally issued at a price of 17 pounds, which was 1 pound higher than the market price. Another 3,500 pounds of continued issuance of German bonds with prints were sold at a price of 16 pounds 15 shillings, which was 15 shillings higher than the market price. 2,000 pounds of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bond were sold at a price of 18 pounds 15 shillings, which was 5 shillings higher than the market price, but slightly lower than the previous day by 5 shillings.

The listed prices of London British Far East company stocks on the 24th of this month (Tuesday) were generally stable. Only the price of the Kulake Langban Rubber stock fell by 2 shillings 6 pence to 17 shillings 6 pence. Also, the previous report that the price of the Kailan Mining Administration stock fell by 6 pence was an error of falling by 3 pence. The market price should be 16 shillings 6 pence. We hereby make a correction.

### Active Settlements, Tight Foreign Exchange

The foreign exchange market yesterday was characterized by active settlements by companies such as Mobil Oil and British American Tobacco, combined with a weak desire to sell by banks and a strong desire to buy, which led to a gradually tightening trend. Although cotton yarn merchants came to sell in the middle, it had no impact.

In the morning, the London silver price rose both near-term and long-term, the New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London gold price also did not rise or fall. The exchange rate of British to American currencies fell by 1.2 li, to French currency fell by 13 centimes, and to Shanghai currency was flat. The exchange rate of American to British currencies fell by 0.125, to French currency remained unchanged, and to Shanghai currency fell slightly by 1 fen. The central listing of various exchange rates remained fixed. The early selling price of banks was 8 pence 40625 for British currency and 16 yuan 34375 for American currency, which was flat compared to the previous closing for British currency and slightly tighter by 0.03125 for American currency. After the opening, money exchange businesses sold American currency to Holland-China Banking Corporation at 16 yuan 4375, and cotton yarn merchants also sold American currency to American banks at 16 yuan 375, so the situation was still stable. The HSBC listing was announced to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to rise by 0.25. Afterwards, cotton yarn merchants sold American currency to Chase Bank and Holland-China Banking Corporation at 16 yuan 3125. Later, Mobil Oil and other companies made settlements, and a certain foreign company settled with Mercantile Bank and HSBC at 8 pence 375 for spot pounds. Then British American Tobacco settled with Mercantile Bank at only 8 pence 328125. Later, Mobil Oil purchased from Bank of America, Chase, Holland and British Bank at only 8 pence 28125, so the process was quite tight. Finally, money exchange businesses sold Hong Kong currency to China and Italy Bank and Holland Bank at 56 yuan 375 and 56.5 yuan, so the trend gradually stabilized. Money exchange businesses sold American dollar notes at 16 yuan 4375. The midday closing selling price of banks was 8 pence 359375 for British currency and 16 yuan 28125 for American currency. As a result, compared to the previous closing, British currency fell by 0.046875 and American currency tightened by 0.09375, and Hong Kong currency tightened by 0.375. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

### Yarn and Flowers: The Financial World Hoards Profits, Cotton Yarn Market Exceptionally Tight, Domestic Demand Still Exists, But Lacks Funds to Procure Goods

The yarn market remains firm and stable, with a slow upward trend. Speculation among financial circles is increasingly fervent, with outsiders also entering the market to absorb supplies, leading to market firmness. However, there is no sign of genuine demand development, mainly because the Lunar New Year is approaching, and there is usually a period of tightening in credit, with no intention of procuring goods. Only Yunnan merchants show a strong appetite for coarse yarn. According to surveys, various merchant groups report that domestic cotton yarn demand still exists. The biggest reason is that banks are not allowing full remittances, leading to a lack of funds for procurement. Merchants are unable to purchase goods and must wait for local products to be sold for cash flow. Consequently, there is a general bullish sentiment, with buyers rushing in, but actual consumption remains poor. The market is rising, but not dramatically, and any slight wind will cause a setback, though the price will eventually rebound. 20-count Shuang Ma yarn has reached 406 yuan, surpassing the previous peak on the 10th of this month.

Looking at the spot yarn market today, trading was brisk at the opening due to continuous purchases of Shuang Ma paper receipts by certain firms the previous afternoon. The opening price for Shuang Ma spot was raised by two yuan to 406 yuan, with 70 bales traded among peers. Shortly after, banks entered the market to buy 100-200 bales of paper receipts at 400 yuan. However, subsequent sales to customers were not smooth, and Guangdong merchants slightly reduced their holdings of Shuang Ma spot, causing the price to fall by one yuan to 405 yuan, but the market remained strong. Total morning transactions amounted to 1,305 bales, with 20-count Shuang Ma up two yuan, Tian Nv up two and a half yuan, Te Jin Cheng up two and a half yuan, Shuang Di Qiu up two and a half yuan, Mu Yang up one yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn Hong Shuang Ma up four yuan due to strong demand from Yunnan merchants. Bao Yi rose six yuan. The factory New Yu opened sales of 200 bales of 10-count Shuang Di Qiu at 300 yuan, purchased by Yunnan merchants. Today, 110 bales were exported to Shantou and 440 bales to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each merchant group is listed below:

Japanese yarn market, spot yarn business, although frequent and average, the market price gradually upward, covering the Japanese plant for forward cargo quotation are not willing to open for sale, so people raised, 20-count Shui Yue spot yarn price of 318 yuan, this month 317 yuan, next month 320 yuan, 20-count Lan Feng spot yarn price of 313.5 yuan, this month 313 yuan, next month 317 yuan, it is said.

### Local Cotton Sources Nearly Cut Off, Foreign Cotton Trade Increasing Daily

Foreign cotton market prices: Chamberlain announced yesterday to the country a plan to prepare for war, to cultivate military strength, to protect world peace, Italian foreign minister rumored that he will be hired in Germany, because of the tension in the European political situation, so securities still have a large number of sales, the cotton market was also implicated, but recently due to the hot sales of cloth, the spot cotton transaction is still good, once rebounded, the result before twisting rose two or three pounds of sound, India fell more than one rubi, Egypt fell more than twenty pounds, yesterday's exchange rate without much change, converted into legal currency, the cotton price is calculated in American cotton and Brazilian cotton each deducted four corners, Indian cotton fell two corners, Egyptian cotton fell more than eight corners,

The city's foreign cotton transactions, because the local cotton source is cut off, the price is surprisingly expensive, and the factories did not talk about transactions, but foreign cotton transactions are increasingly lively, in addition to the factory has a large opening in, the flower number also has a large number of orders, the Chinese factory, Shen Xin purchased the most, yesterday also sent in Indian cotton Durant pull 500 bales, that is, loaded into the factory 67.5 yuan, Cha Gou Omar.

### Why is Yarn Price Rising? Read This Paragraph First

Recently, the market price of cotton yarn has been progressing daily. Since the beginning of the "Red Plate" this year, it has been rising steadily in less than a month. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn has risen by 47 yuan compared to the price at the end of last year, and the upward trend is slow and steady. How can the market be so consolidated? There are still reasons for this, which will be briefly described below:

(1) The recent war situation is smooth, and the domestic demand for cotton yarn and cotton cloth is still maintainable.

(2) Since the securities market has been fluctuating, the general financial wealthy have released public bonds and invested in cotton yarn. Therefore, although actual sales are not smooth, the stock of spot goods is very scarce.

(3) The futures market for yarn and cloth trading has been closed since the "August 13" War of Resistance. Most brokers are idle. Some of them, realizing that sitting and eating will not work in the long run, have changed their business and entered the spot market. Their goal is naturally only to buy, with no intention of selling. As a result, the stock of spot goods is even tighter. Moreover, Shao and Bian have been silent for a long time and are now very active in the spot yarn market, buying a lot of yarn and opening forward positions for thousands of bales, which shows their strong bullish view.

(4) Since cotton has been subjected to unified control by the "Japanese puppet" regime, exports from the north are prohibited, and the source is cut off. The stock around the suburbs is dwindling day by day, and the market price is rising sharply. The price of coarse cotton is reaching new highs, which has aroused the speculation of speculators, financial circles, and nervous people, and the desire to collect is spontaneously generated. Therefore, the market often hears that a certain yarn merchant is entrusted by a certain bank to buy hundreds of bales of Shuang Ma at a premium of several yuan. As a result, the market becomes increasingly tight, and the price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn has reached 406 yuan, surpassing the high price of 403 yuan on the 10th of this month. According to market discussions, most opinions are that there is no way to deal with raw materials, and the future will remain stable. Fortunately, the pricing of Indian cotton is not only not rising but falling, because there is talk of the US government selling its cotton reserves, and the market price remains weak. The unstable European situation and the decline in world consumption are the biggest reasons for the pressure on the price of American cotton. According to surveys, the stock of spot yarn in yarn and cloth warehouses has reached 20,000 bales. This cargo is all deposited by hoarders who have paid advances, waiting for a good price to sell. (A)

### Yao Cotton Source Blocked

Local cotton business is becoming more and more depressed, and the factory is completely in a state of stagnation. Although the trade has a demand, but the package feet are very fresh, are to offset the factory's transaction. The selling price is still as stable as usual. The stock of cotton in the vicinity of the four suburbs is dwindling, so the source is declining. The factory, in view of the above situation, have purchased and ordered foreign cotton to supplement, the amount of Indian cotton procured by Chinese factories has been increasing in recent days, the local cotton transactions, all of which have been seized by them almost all of them. The cotton in the Subei area is still good, and it is reported that the Yao flower Zhejiang authorities have ordered that it should not be exported, and the source has been blocked recently. 1,923 bales of Tong Hua have arrived on the wharf, and the opening price is unknown. Another 310 pieces from Beisha, the current cotton transaction volume and market conditions are listed on the left:

### One Hundred Months! Fifty Months! Unexpectedly wartime bonuses are so generous. It's all about creating opportunities to love national products. One year of earnings equals nine years and four months.

The market price of 20-count cotton yarn was 263 yuan in December of the year before last (1937). By March of last year, it had exceeded the 300 yuan mark. Subsequently, it gradually rose until October, when this newspaper resumed publication. The price reached a peak of 515 yuan, an increase of more than 250 yuan per bale in less than a year. Such an increase has probably never been seen before. As a result, all yarn mills made a fortune in 1938. At the end of the year, a certain yarn mill distributed bonuses equivalent to 100 months' salary to all employees, regardless of their position. Another yarn mill distributed bonuses equivalent to 50 months' salary to its employees. Some people thought this was not true and suspected that the news was exaggerated. In fact, all the news in this newspaper is based on facts. For example, the news about "Silver and Money Industries Making a Fortune" that was published the other day was later verified by the "Zi Lin Daily" through interviews with certain banks. Although the banks were evasive and seemed to think that the statement was too high, the fact is that some banks had profits of tens of millions, and others had profits of millions. This newspaper does not want to publish their names to avoid unnecessary trouble. Fortunately, this kind of news is beneficial to these industries and increases their credibility. However, some yarn mills in the occupied areas would rather be destroyed than surrender and suffer considerable losses, while others are half-hearted and content with temporary pleasure.

### Food: Rumor has it that Tianjin is Continuing to Order Large Quantities of Foreign Flour, Estimated at 300,000+ Bags, Price Set at $4.67

Yesterday, spot flour sales suddenly decreased because it was rumored that Tianjin merchants are continuing to order large quantities of foreign flour, estimated at more than 300,000 bags, with the price set at $4.67, for delivery at the end of March. Moreover, previously ordered flour also began to arrive in early last week, so Tianjin flour sales have turned sluggish, and other northern merchants are also watching and not taking action. After continuous purchases by the Nanyang merchants in recent days, their appetite seems to be satisfied. As a result, the total city transaction was less than 20,000 bags, with half of it purchased by our local merchants. No. 2 flour is still priced at $4.80, while the next grade of flour is difficult to deliver. Today, 3,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Shantou.

### A Certain Foreign Firm is Procuring 60,000 Bags of Low-Grade Rice in the Songjiang and Sijing Areas, Suffered from Water Damage in Transit, Merchants Must Compensate, Domestic Merchants are Stepping Back to Avoid

Although the source of domestic rice has not been weak in recent days, it is heard that in the Songjiang and Sijing areas, a certain foreign firm is going to procure 60,000 bags of low-grade rice. Once the foreign firm takes action, the local area will be sealed off, prohibiting other merchants from shipping. This action not only affects the source of supply in this port, but the goods procured by the foreign firm must have a special mark printed on the rice bags. If they are damaged by rain during transit, the foreign firm will demand unreasonable compensation from the merchants, causing domestic merchants to be fearful and avoiding the area. Yesterday's arrivals were fewer than before, only three barges arriving downstream, with about 7,000 bags of "wheel bun" rice. The seller's intention is very firm, but because the sales of the local street and hoarders are still sluggish, the situation is still soft. Thick and thin japonica rice has little change, and the same is true for Du Yang and Du Jian rice. However, glutinous rice is scarce and fragrant, and the market is still brisk. Although the price of high-quality goods has not risen yet, the price of mid-quality goods has risen slightly.

### Wheat Still Deadlocked

Yesterday, the source of wheat continued to be scarce. About 3,000 bags of new wheat arrived from the Yangtze River area. The sellers believe that the production price has not loosened and the costs are high, so they are unwilling to sell cheaply. However, the factories are still relying on foreign wheat supplies and are slackening their demand for domestic wheat. As a result, the two sides are deadlocked, and only a total of 4,500 bags of wheat from Jiangbei, Chuzhou, and Wuhu were traded, with 3,000 bags purchased by the Fuxin Factory and 1,500 bags purchased by the Fufeng Factory. The highest price was still $6.50.

### Sugar Market: New Diao Qing Directly Shipped to Wenzhou for Sale

Since the opening price of new domestic Diao Qing was 13.1 yuan, there has been no subsequent arrival. It is more cost-effective to ship directly from the producing area to Wenzhou and Haimen for sale, so the procurement price suddenly rose. According to Longxi's telegram yesterday, the price has risen by 2 yuan. Therefore, it is foreseeable that there will not be much future goods. Yesterday, the Chao merchant opened 76 bags of Chen Gao Huang Gang Qing at 13.5 yuan. New white-wrapped Hainan Red arrived from the Guangdong merchant and was priced at 12.4 yuan. More than 50 bags of Da Gong rice flour from the Fujian merchant were opened at 22.5 yuan, an increase of 0.3 yuan. The trend of foreign sugar is stable. The association set the price of 24 Dutch coarse white at 25 yuan for spot goods and 16.8 yuan for transit goods. The price of Tai Koo Sugar B mark has not changed. Yesterday, 2,000 bags of sugar were shipped to Ningbo.

### Piece Goods: Wenzhou and Ningbo Merchants Still Urgently Requesting Shipment

Lun Chang Selling Goods at a Premium, Dye Factories are Also Replenishing

The domestic cloth market is firm. The English firm Lun Chang's slightly more popular products, floral cloth up a corner, blue cloth bleached cloth up two corners, spot goods are very scarce, printed straight tribute market price of 13.5 yuan, better patterns have no goods, hand goods resold at a premium of five corners, Jin San Ta bleached cloth hand goods up three corners from last week, sold open white goods, still little change, Heng Feng Central printed satin floral crepe, the market needs are frequent, Yunnan merchants added 1,600 pieces of fabric, Shilin cloth bleached cloth 50 boxes, the local street wholesale village and Yongtai gang also searched for 50 boxes, Haikou gang did color inclined color cloth bleached inclined more than 1,000 pieces, Sichuan gang entered satin floral crepe floral hemp yarn color inclined 80 boxes, Fujian gang entered color inclined color cloth fine cloth twill 2,000 pieces, Wenzhou and Ningbo gang miscellaneous color twill fabric checkered factory cloth urgently request shipment, white goods fine cloth fine inclined coarse cloth new purchases nearly 100 pieces, the local street purchase of various pound coarse cloth about 100 pieces, dye blanks fine inclined coarse inclined fifty pieces, domestic and foreign Singapore Siam and other places to do the stomach is also frequent, or delivered bleached cloth bleached inclined color cloth floral cloth Ning silk more than 3,200 pieces,

East cloth yesterday because the local customer sales are prosperous, fine cloth fine inclined prices are rising, Tianjin gang entered various brands of fine cloth 700 pieces, New inclined more than 200 pieces, the local street dye factory to add fine cloth fine inclined is also nearly a thousand pieces, the market atmosphere is strong, fine cloth gradually rose (per piece) five points to a corner, the market opened futures sales more expensive, Yi Teng foreign firm ordered 12 pounds of flying fish fine cloth (February) price 11.55 yuan, (March) 11.6 yuan, Longtou fine cloth (February) 11.5 yuan, (March) 11.55 yuan, two total do open four hundred packages,

Exports yesterday had 180 pieces of piece goods shipped to Shantou and 580 pieces shipped to Haiphong.

### Medicinal Materials: Lily Bulb Slices Sold Out in Producing Areas

Lily bulb slices have recently been sold out in the producing areas, leading to a cut in the source of supply. The stock of goods in the hands of local merchants is also dwindling due to continuous purchases from Hong Kong merchants, so the trend is tight. Previously, the market price was 21 yuan per picul, but it has now risen to 22.5 yuan, which is quite firm.

### Old Sayings About Furs

— Dehui

China is a major producer of furs, so many people wear furs. In ancient times, there were restrictions on wearing furs. For example, fox fur could not be lightly used by people without status. According to research, there were "Emperor Yao wearing deer fur in winter," "King Wen of Zhou wearing blue phoenix feather fur," "Emperor Wu of Han wearing Western Region auspicious clothes fur," and "Emperor Jingzong of Tang wearing Nanchang floating light fur." These were the general instances of heads of state wearing fur. The fur worn by officials included Yanzi's deer fur clothing, Lu Xun's fox fur clothing, and Zhang Zongchang's fur collected by Empress Wu Zetian. As for the fur worn by famous scholars, there was "Wang Gong sitting in a high hall in high spirits, wearing crane fur." and "Yan Guang, living in seclusion in Tongjiang, fishing and wearing sheepskin." Although there is research, it is not limited to these few people, but the above examples already include heads of state, officials, and famous scholars, which can represent a glimpse of fur clothing in ancient times.

Confucius, the great sage and teacher, is known to everyone as a sage. He not only liked to wear fur but also had artistic designs. This is recorded in the "Analects of Confucius" section on "Village Parties": "He wore black clothes with lambskin fur, white clothes with fox fur, and yellow clothes with fox fur. He wore a long casual fur coat, with the right sleeve shortened." In these few words, how to prepare and design the fur is taken care of in every aspect. Because it was lambskin fur, it was matched with black clothes; fox fur was matched with white clothes; and fox fur was matched with yellow clothes. Isn't this Confucius's artistic design? Moreover, in order to keep warm and comfortable, he often wore a longer casual coat, and in order to make work more convenient, he shortened the right sleeve slightly, showing that Confucius greatly advocated the wearing of fur.

### West Port Leather and North Port Leather

— Zhengyan

The production area of West Port leather is limited to the Northwest, generally not exceeding the provinces of Qinghai, Xikang, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia; while the North Port leather is limited to the production of Mongolia and Northeast and North China; that is, including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Shandong.

The most famous producing areas of West Port leather are Qinghai and Xikang provinces, which produce lynx, sheep, mountain dogs (cat leopards), West foxes, grass foxes, musk deer, civets, sika deer, wolves, marmots, Tibetan gazelles, big-headed sheep, tigers, and wild horses. Among them, lynx, West foxes, and marmots are the most valuable, while grass foxes, civets, and musk deer are next, and sheep, mountain dogs, wolves, Tibetan gazelles, and big-headed sheep are second. Although sika deer and tiger skins are both valuable leather goods, they belong to decorative items. Gansu and Ningxia produce the most big-headed sheep, sheep, Tibetan gazelles, mountain rats, and wolves, especially in Ejina, Alxa, and the Helan Mountains and Liupan Mountains areas. The total annual output is no less than Qinghai and Xikang. However, the production of civets, foxes, marmots, and lynx is extremely small. Shaanxi is famous for producing marmots, but the quality is not as good as Qinghai and Kang, because Shaanxi's climate is much warmer than Qinghai and Kang. Secondly, the production of civets and foxes is relatively small, and there are also many mountain rats.

The more famous producing areas of North Port leather are, of course, the four provinces of Northeast China: Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. In addition to goats, mountain dogs, leopards, wolves, tigers, mountain rats, marmots, civets, foxes, and wild cats, the most valuable product is sable. However, the production of sable in Northeast China is not very high, but in East Mongolia, especially in the Tannu Uriankhai area, it is almost purely famous for the production of this sable. However, because the area is close to Kulun and the Soviet Union, there were very few shipments into the interior in the past due to inconvenient transportation.

Among the four provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Shandong, the provinces that produce the most leather are Hebei and Chahar, especially in eastern Hebei and Guyuan, Duolun, and Chicheng in northern Chahar. The main products are wolves, leopards, mountain dogs, sheep, Tibetan gazelles, wild camels, and mountain rats, while civets, foxes, and marmots are rare.

The largest concentration of China's leather market is in five places: Zhangjiakou, Jinan, Tianjin, Xi'an, and Zhengzhou. Now three of the five places have fallen, and the markets in Xi'an and Zhengzhou are no longer as prosperous as in the past, which is regrettable.

### Simple Method for Washing Leather Goods

— Feifei

Leather goods are a good product for keeping warm and protecting against the cold in winter. The types are divided into coarse, fine, superior, and inferior, and the prices are naturally different. However, those who own heavy fur coats are originally the wealthy class. Even if they are cheap goods, they must cost at least dozens of yuan, so poor scholars can never become customers in leather goods stores. However, if wearing a leather coat is not about showing off or showing nobility, but only about keeping warm and protecting against the cold, then people with ordinary means can also afford to buy one. Because the high-quality fine products such as fox fur, sable, lynx, otter skin, and gray squirrel spread fur naturally cost dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of gold per piece, how can they be afforded except by those noble people. But the same leather coat is made of ordinary lambskin or black sheepskin, which is also very economical. The better ones cost only about 20 yuan, and the worse ones cost only more than 10 yuan. Friends who are savvy and good at calculating will even go to second-hand clothing stores to buy old goods to modify. If they are careful when wearing them, they can often replace the lining at least three or four times. Although some bad leather pieces will inevitably be cut off later, and some new small leather pieces will be added to supplement them, it is still cost-effective. Therefore, leather goods are still a kind of economical and decent clothing among the general public.

However, you should also understand some knowledge of cleaning leather goods when wearing leather coats, otherwise, half of the person will be damaged, and half of the coat will be damaged. A good thing will definitely be lost due to not knowing how to clean it. Here. I will tell the readers of this magazine the simple leather cleaning method and the method of preserving leather goods for reference.

White lambskin hair is most prone to getting dirty and black, and the luster and smoothness of the hair will also be lost, so you have to wash it after wearing it for a winter or a period of time: However, leather goods are not ordinary clothes after all. If the leather version is damp, it will turn into saltpeter and harden, and a piece of clothing will be finished. Moreover, the dirt on the hair is not easy to wash away; Indeed, how can any item be washed away its dirt without water and soap. Now I have a method that is quite convenient. You only need to expose the leather liner to the sun for a long time, then gently pat off the dust in the hair roots, and then use a soft brush to slowly straighten the hair strands. At that time, use a sprayer to spray a layer of light oil (gasoline or rosin water) on the hair surface. It must be uniform, and at the same time, immediately apply the old powder (buy from the raw material number, one pound of the old powder) evenly on the top (it is better to use English powder or flour), and rub it slowly with your palms, spread it out, wait for it to dry, then brush off the powder, and then pat it with your hands to make it clean. After three times of this, the fur will be white and will not be damaged at all. However, I am afraid that there will be an odor left after washing, so you still need to wash it with light oil again. Because the old powder is prone to flying into the lungs and making people cough, it is best to wear a nose and mouth cover when washing the leather. As for the method of storing leather, it is even easier, but it is best to store it after washing to avoid insects and rot. Other methods such as sun-drying the leather, placing camphor, and storing it in a camphor wood box are naturally also methods to avoid insects; However, camphor on the leather will also be destroyed, so before storing, you should apply camphor powder on the sun-dried leather goods after it is cool, and then brush off the powder, leaving only its aroma. When packing, use a hundred-part water to wash the box again, and hide a package of camphor powder in each corner of the box, then it will be foolproof.

### Let's Promote Leather Goods

— Bow and Arrow

There are generally two kinds of clothing materials for keeping out the cold in winter: leather goods and wool. However, both of these clothing materials are made of the fur of animals. Therefore, wool is also known as woolen fabrics. Here I sincerely hope that the Chinese people will promote leather goods and not buy wool. There are two reasons for this:

Wool is mostly imported, while leather goods are mostly domestic products. Although there are a few woolen mills in China now, the output is too small. If everyone buys it, the amount produced by Chinese manufacturers will not be enough to supply. We only need to look at the various wools displayed on the market, and it can almost be said that none of them are foreign goods. As for leather goods, except for a very small number of uncommon varieties, the rest, whether ordinary, high-quality, or practical, are all domestic products. Therefore, fellow countrymen who love national products, it is more reliable to buy leather goods than to buy wool.

Wool is made from animal hair after a step of spinning and weaving. It has become an extremely fine material, and its ability to maintain body temperature is naturally not as great as that of leather goods. Leather goods are made of natural animal skins, and the fluffy hair can preserve the original temperature; Moreover, if leather goods are stored properly, they will last much longer than the relatively easy-to-moth wools. So from these points of view, we should promote leather goods.

Here I would like to introduce a reliable leather goods store, Tian Fa Xiang Leather Goods Bureau, which has a long history and a solid reputation among the general public. As the Spring Festival is approaching, everyone wants to add new clothes, and you can take advantage of the fact that the bureau is currently offering its last amazing price, so you can visit and see the products.

### Concerning Fur Coats

— Yingdai

Fur coats are indeed worth promoting. Once winter arrives, whether you wear Chinese or Western clothing, both have their drawbacks. Those who wear Western clothing find it too cold in winter and switch to Chinese attire. However, since they usually don't own Chinese garments, they have to have everything from inner shirts to padded jackets newly made. Moreover, in addition to a fur coat, they also need to have an overcoat made. Some people, due to social obligations, cannot do without both Chinese and Western clothing, so they not only need to make a Chinese-style overcoat but also a Western-style overcoat. For the sake of both Chinese and Western outfits, one has to acquire quite a few clothes to get through a winter, naturally incurring a significant expense.

Therefore, I once advocated adopting a fur coat that could be used for both Chinese and Western attire, which would remedy this shortcoming. The style of the fur coat I'm referring to could be Western, but longer than the Western-style overcoats currently in fashion. That way, if you want to wear Chinese clothing, you can simply pair it with a lined robe or a velvet robe; if you wear Western clothing, you can put it on over it. Not only can it be used for both, but it can also prevent you from feeling your legs are too cold when wearing a Western-style overcoat outdoors because it is too short. Even when wearing Chinese clothing, since the inner garments are thinner, you won't feel too heavy.

The so-called fur coat uses silk or woolen fabric as the outer layer and fur as the lining, making it warmer than ordinary overcoats. And as we all know, fur is very durable. High-quality furs can last through three to five outer layers, or even be passed down through generations. A father's fur coat can be taken apart by his son and remade. Therefore, a fur coat can last at least ten or eight years. At most, the outer layer might wear out and be replaced, but the lining doesn't need to be replaced. In this regard, it is also more economical than using satin or camel hair for the lining.

Based on the above, we can easily see that fur coats have many advantages, especially their durability, economy, practicality, and the necessity of promoting them. If fur stores could pay attention to this and hire someone to design and manufacture a convenient and stylish fur coat for both Chinese and Western use, making the public aware of its advantages and adopting it, it would not only help people economize on winter clothing but also promote the fur business!

### Sable Fur

— Tiansun

A sable fur coat is indeed a family heirloom of the Hua family of Sansheng. Although Hua Sansheng is named Sansheng, he cannot reflect on himself three times a day like the ancient sages, but instead is immersed in a drunken stupor day and night; he feels like he cannot live a day without drinking. As long as he has wine to drink, he is willing to die drunk, possessing the courage of Liu Ling, who said, "When I die, just bury me!"

The Hua family is not a wealthy family, but his great-grandfather served as a high official in the Qing Dynasty for several years. His political achievements were quite good, so the emperor awarded him a sable fur coat. The old man was moved to tears, considering it the greatest honor of his life; therefore, when he reached the age of eighty, he summoned his family to take out the sable fur coat from the gilded chest and solemnly handed it to his son, trembling as he said, "My son, this is the only treasure your father has in his life. The emperor's deep kindness is all entrusted to this. You must treasure it well and pass it down from generation to generation, so that future generations will know that their ancestors were not useless. No matter how poor you become, you must not consider using this sable fur coat. Only on New Year's Day or when the country has grand celebrations is the head of the family allowed to wear it once; at other times, it must be stored in the gilded chest. Take it out to air it out in the heat of June, and never forget it. Put in plenty of mothballs to prevent moths. If you don't listen to me and something happens to this treasure, even if my spirit is gone, I will turn into a vengeful ghost to punish you. This is my only dying wish, I have nothing else to say."

Sansheng's grandfather was able to abide by his father's will, treasuring the sable fur coat throughout his life. Not only did he not dare to wear it on New Year's Day, but he also didn't dare to wear it even when the country had grand celebrations; except for airing it out for three days during the hottest days of summer, it was locked away in the gilded chest year-round, like a prisoner serving a sentence. When he was dying, he also told his son his father's last words, saying that this was the family heirloom and that you must protect it with your life, otherwise you would be unfilial and rebellious.

By the time the Hua family passed down to Sansheng's father, they had declined. The poor scholar could not carry or lift, and had no other skills, so he opened a Confucian shop and lived a life of sitting on a cold bench. One year, on New Year's Eve, he really couldn't get through the terrible end of the year; he repeatedly opened the gilded chest, staring blankly at the sable fur coat, wanting to send it to a pawnshop to exchange for some money to relieve the emergency, but when he reached out to touch the soft sable fur, he suddenly recoiled as if shocked by electricity, as if he heard his father's voice roaring in his ear, and as if he saw the ghost of his grandfather appearing before him. Finally, he sighed deeply, closed the gilded chest again, and used his silver tongue to plead with several close relatives, barely managing to borrow some money to scrape through the New Year. Pitifully, he worried about poverty every year, and died of worry and poverty before the age of sixty. Of course, when he died, he also told Sansheng his grandfather and father's last words, telling Sansheng to treasure the sable fur coat as he himself had, even if he worried and died of poverty. He was a very meticulous person, and fearing that Sansheng was unreliable, he specifically instructed his daughter-in-law to also bear half the responsibility for treasuring it. Sansheng's wife, with tears in her eyes, agreed in one breath.

Sansheng was a scholarly child with a good education, but he was too much of a celebrity and did not engage in household production. The one thing he always adhered to was Li Bai's saying that "nothing is better than a cup in hand," and he didn't care about anything as long as he had a cup in hand. Usually, he could earn some money with his pen, but in the blink of an eye, it would turn into yellow soup poured into his intestines. His wife was a very virtuous woman, and she often bitterly persuaded him not to love wine like his life, torturing his body. However, he cited the teachings of the wine ancestor Liu Ling to resist her, saying, "The words of women are the least to be listened to."

Sansheng's alcohol consumption grew day by day, while the money in his pocket dwindled day by day. Because almost every one of the 365 days of the year was spent drunk as mud, how could he write anything? If he didn't write, naturally there would be no income. His wife had no way to think, and washed her face with tears every day, while diligently doing chores, earning some money to maintain their lives, and also having to buy some wine for Sansheng in addition to the seven necessities of life. Sansheng complained that she bought too little, not enough to satisfy his addiction, and often argued with her endlessly. One day, while she was out buying firewood and rice, he broke the lock on the gilded chest and stole the family heirloom, the sable fur coat, and pawned it for one hundred dollars, living the life he wanted in his drunken stupor with his band of drinking buddies.

When his wife returned and saw the gilded chest open and the sable fur coat gone, she cried bitterly for a long time, but there was nothing she could do. When Sansheng returned drunk in the middle of the night, she finally managed to find the pawn ticket in his pocket, secretly put it away, and from then on, she had to work two days' worth of work every day, not daring to relax at all. After a full year of hard work, she finally earned an extra hundred dollars, secretly redeemed the sable fur coat without her husband's knowledge, and treasured it in a broken box; she was very happy in her heart, seeing this family heirloom return to the Hua family's door, and that night she had a dream in which the three generations of Hua ancestors came to thank her.

The devastating war broke out, and the hometown of Hua Sansheng and his wife could not escape the catastrophe. One day, Sansheng was buying drinks in a tavern when a team of silver-gray iron birds flew by and dropped several bombs, destroying the tavern and the surrounding houses. Sansheng's wife received the bad news and cried so hard she almost died. She finally managed to find Sansheng's incomplete body in the rubble and hastily buried it in the ancestral tomb; then she packed the sable fur coat in a bundle, tied it to her back with a rope, and traveled dozens of miles overnight to a rear hospital to work as a nurse, engaging in relief work. She thought that Sansheng had no descendants, so what was the point of guarding this family heirloom? She asked someone to take it to the city, sold it for several hundred dollars, and donated it all to the country, exchanging it for many winter clothes for the soldiers on the front lines. Her heart suddenly felt relieved. That night, she had another dream in which the three generations of Hua ancestors were all smiling—smiling sweetly.

Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Transportation

### Eden's Clothing

— Zhang Zhenshan

Former British Foreign Secretary Eden is a person who loves clothing the most. The clothes he wears, even a handkerchief, are modern. He has never used outdated materials, colors, or styles of clothing: Moreover, the clothes he wears are neat and crisp. Besides wearing dinner suits, he changes at least three sets of casual wear every day, and even his shirts and socks must be changed from time to time.

One New Year's, because he was going to attend a grand banquet in diplomatic circles, he specially designed and patterned the dress himself, and asked a tailor to specially make a dress. The style was generous, and the color was elegant, invisibly increasing his solemn and lofty demeanor. Therefore, many great figures in diplomatic circles have successively imitated it, and even called such clothes "Eden Style," even the top hat is "Eden Style." Nowadays, London is still very popular with this Eden-style hat.

Not long ago, someone made a statistic on the number of his clothes. It is said that if he changed a set of clothes every three hours in his wardrobe, then the clothes he wore in eight months would not have the same style and color. This is also a rare piece of news about clothes, right?

Hearing this kind of rare news about clothes, of course, we don't need to say that he is extravagant in a poor or jealous tone, because he has no other hobbies, and the money he earns can be spent on clothes, not to mention that he has strong productivity, not to mention that he is still a rich man! If we have his intelligence, courage, loyalty, and greatness, we may not be able to wear so many clothes!

### Talking About Food Supplementation

— He Lisan

At this time of winter storage, it is the season for health practitioners to "supplement in time": However, supplementation has the distinction between "medicine supplementation" and "food supplementation", and there is a folk saying that "medicine supplementation is not as good as food supplementation": It is true that food supplementation is more affordable, as it can satisfy the appetite and also benefit the body. The following are some examples of food supplements:

Cordyceps Duck: Take a large duck, cut it open and wash it clean. First, boil it once with water to remove the foam, add aged wine, salt, Southern ham, winter bamboo shoots, and other ingredients, then add some Cordyceps sinensis and wolfberry. Place it in a crock and simmer gently until it is tender. It is a medicinal supplement in food supplement, its taste is light and fresh, without any medicinal taste, and it has the effect of greatly supplementing the lungs and kidneys.

Yin Yang Paste: Cut mutton into pieces, first boil to remove the foam, then cook until half tender, add an appropriate amount of aged wine, rock sugar, and soy sauce. Then mix in soaked sea cucumber and simmer slowly until tender. Mutton helps Yang, and sea cucumber nourishes Yin. Yin and Yang are both supplemented, so it is also called "Yin Yang Paste".

Fresh Beef Juice: Cut several taels of beef into small pieces and place in a special earthenware pot. (Available at pharmacies.) Add a little salt and simmer in water. After two or three hours, fresh beef juice will be formed, and its supplementary effect is quite significant.

Fresh Chicken Juice: Take a large hen, cut it open and wash it clean, then place it in a large bowl and steam it in a pot until cooked through. Take out the yellow chicken juice, add a little salt and eat it. Its taste is delicious, and its supplementary power is also extremely strong. If you use a young hen, you can chop it up and put it in an earthenware pot to stew.

Mutton Porridge: Add white mutton to hot porridge. It is most suitable for those with Yang deficiency.

Eight Treasure Porridge: Cook glutinous rice porridge with chestnuts, lotus seeds, gorgon fruit, red dates, etc. Add rock sugar, called "Eight Treasure Porridge", which can nourish the five internal organs.

Egg Milk: Beat an egg thoroughly and pour in boiled milk, which has a great supplementary effect.

Egg Soy Milk: Beat an egg thoroughly and pour in hot tofu milk, its effect is no less than chicken.

### A Weekly Economical Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Pork and fish each have their own characteristics. Cooking them separately certainly has its own flavor, but when cooked together, the pork has the flavor of fish inside, and the fish has the flavor of meat inside, which is even more wonderful. For example, cuttlefish, braised alone, or stewed and mixed with sauce sesame oil, are very good snacks for drinking; if after the cuttlefish is braised or stewed, add some small pieces of pork inside, add soy sauce and bamboo shoot slices, and braise together, the taste is very rich, and it is refreshing to eat with rice. In addition to cuttlefish, there is also a type of light dried fish (said to be dried marinated yellow croaker), which is also most suitable for braising with pork. Sugar and soy sauce must be added a lot to make it flavorful. It is more refreshing to eat with rice than braised cuttlefish with pork. Both of these are added to this week's menu.

### Transportation

— Refugee

In Shanghai, the two feet seem to have lost their effectiveness, because there are means of transportation——cars, trams, rickshaws, traveling in all directions, even a distance of two or three miles, only costs three cents, and it takes only five minutes, which saves energy and time. Of course, it is what people who don't care about three cents are happy to take. Of course, means of transportation provide a lot of convenience for the busy people of Shanghai, but it also cultivates people's laziness. And fleeing is a great opportunity for us to reform our lives, that is, forty or fifty miles of road, when there are no cars or sedan chairs on the road early in the morning and no boats on the waterway, for the sake of survival, following the crowd to walk a long distance, and when we arrive at a safe place, although our feet are blistered and our legs are sore, we feel infinite comfort in our spirits. But after ten months of Shanghai life, I was gradually assimilated by the customs, and often felt annoyed after walking a few steps, but when the taste of fleeing came to my mind, the coming and going cars could not lure me to step on its ladder, but just thinking. Still continue my walking.

I recall: More than ten days on the ship, unable to move, seeing the trackers and every pedestrian on the shore, I admired them. With the permission of the boatman, we happily went ashore, as free and unrestrained as a caged bird getting its freedom. The fresh air and gentle sunshine washed away the depression of the past few days, and we ran after the boatman as if we were released (because they walked very fast), passing through villages and fields, and then walking on uneven and uneven mountain roads, but we could not run, we could only walk slowly. The five-colored wildflowers are for us to pick, and the fragrance of the grass is for us to smell. Because we are greedy for the beauty of the mountains and fields, the boatmen are far away from us and cannot be seen, so they delay their journey. Under their urging, we reluctantly returned to the ship.

In a village, we lived in peace. But the firewood must be picked by ourselves, so we develop the habit of carrying things and walking. The winding path and the small road on the hillside are familiar to us. At first, we are inevitably a little timid, wondering if there are tiger caves in this remote mountain. After a few times of going up the mountain, the firewood at the foot of the mountain cannot satisfy our desires, so we scramble to pick it at a higher place. When we return fully loaded, we sweat all over our bodies, which is what refugees need in winter. Therefore, whenever firewood is scarce and the weather is cold, we go up the mountain together. The few miles of flat road and the sloping mountain road do not seem difficult to us.

When I walk on the flat cement sidewalk, recalling these things, I no longer hate the distance and length of the journey. Although there are no five-colored wildflowers in front of me, and there are no wonderful peaks and no joy of returning fully loaded, the different arrangements in the showcases, the saving of three cents, and the heat of the whole body, are they not the same? So I walk forward without reluctance. After arriving at the destination, they are all shouting cold, and I hurriedly take off my coat. When they ask me, I smile and say: "This is the benefit of walking!"

### Sunset

— Cao Juren

——Impressions of a Wartime Journey

My friend Ke Yun has a wartime report article called "Ruins Sunset," which describes the situation in the desolate sunset outside the ransacked Taierzhuang that day. The concluding section reads:

Returning to the city from the wheat field, there was a dog corpse lying on the slope; dozens of steps away, there was another enemy corpse lying supine on the mud, his upper body covered with yellow mud, leaving only his legs exposed, with rubber boots still on his feet. A ray of sunset light swept across his body.

This impression often floated in our hearts: and an enemy soldier's poem:

Why are we fighting?

The Chinese have suffered torment,

We have also suffered disaster,

Heaven! Heaven!

Who will collect our remains?

Also often rang in our ears. The mood of this poem and the mood of "desolate sunset" are so harmonious that we feel very surprised by our inspiration at that moment. One evening, I was alone outside the North Gate of Shangrao watching the sunset, and this scene was touched again, and I suddenly felt that this mood was too familiar; I suddenly realized that this is the mood of the end of the century.——The basic mood that runs through all the poems and articles written by the enemy to record the war.

Yesterday, I suddenly opened the Iroha song made by the Japanese monk Kukai and said:

Red and purple blossoms, how pitiful they scatter?

Looking all over the world, how much is permanent?

Lost in illusion, now surpassed,

The remaining dream has awakened, neither drunk nor bewitched.

Originally, what permeated the psychology of the Japanese nation was this set of end-of-the-century moods. As the saying goes: "When the sun sets and the road is exhausted, go against the grain," the Japanese warlords' aggression frenzy was originally just a retrograde movement played by a psychology of the end of the century.

Every Japanese warlord is good material in Freud's mental hospital: We can only deeply understand this sentence by standing on the side of the Japanese people and removing all national prejudices. On the Japanese side, although there are self-deprecating words such as "Land of the Rising Sun" or "Asahi," the nobles and warlords who control the fate of the Japanese country, whether from the system itself or from the ×× system, have all reached the fate of "sunset" or "end of the century."

The Japanese room and the warlords have deeply known what the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War will be: This war will never give the Japanese people a dark fate, but the Japanese ×× room and the warlords will join hands with the German and Russian ×× room to go to the museum. This is the general explanation of the Japanese warlords' various struggling postures.

When the European War first broke out, the Tsar said very sadly when he signed the declaration of war, "The terrible test for me has been decided, but I will not be rewarded in this life." From the process of the European War, the people under the old Russian hell were liberated, and the fate of the Tsar's system was ended: It really makes ×× shudder at the setting sun! January 20

### Recruiting Soldiers

— Yue Bin

January sky – azure, peaceful as a sheet of water.

The winter wind here is still so soft, the sun shines, and the earth appears even more harmonious.

On the yellow sand road, we, a group of three, with excited emotions, stride towards the future.

Dust and sand are stirred up by hurried footsteps, and the stream on the right flows gurgling; under the distant clouds, Lotus Mountain vaguely appears beautiful; the emerging city in the distance – Shantou – looks grand enough from here.

This place is called Shi Dai Township.

We are all young men who farm the land, from eighteen to twenty-five years old. At this moment, we have just finished our tenant farming work and are rushing to the township office to draw lots to become conscripted soldiers.

This is already the fourth round. In the previous three rounds, we all missed out, and we were all disappointed – every time, seeing the conscripted soldiers training so spiritedly, it was worth envying.

Therefore, this time, we all hoped: "We should be drawn."

Turning a bend, passing Big Sheng's sugarcane field – in January, the sugarcane is already growing tall and dense.

Ah Bing behind me suddenly ran quickly into the sugarcane field. After a while, he came out holding a sugarcane stalk. He first patted off the leaves on the sugarcane, and then, shouldering the sugarcane like carrying a rifle, he puffed out his chest and ran towards us with running steps.

"One, two, one,... Haha! Big Sheng, do I look like a trained soldier like this?" Saying this, he lay on the ground again, using the sugarcane to make shooting gestures at us.

"Ah Bing, don't be happy for nothing, you probably won't get your share this time," Big Sheng said, and we continued to move forward.

Ah Bing patted the yellow mud off his body, broke the sugarcane into two sections, peeled off the leaves, and ate as he caught up. Facing Big Sheng, he patted his chest and raised his thumb high:

"Hmph! This time, I'll definitely become a soldier for you to see." He was quite enthusiastic.

I felt this was quite joyous. Before the war, as soon as we heard about "recruiting soldiers," we would escape to relatives' homes early; however, now we are all vying to become soldiers.

Entering the village, walking to the township office, which was converted from an ancestral hall – the patio, outside is vast, already standing nearly a hundred people, everyone showing an excited smile. (Although, for the sake of life, some still have worried faces.)

People formed a large circle, the township head, village chief, and fair people all stood by the square table in the middle. Everyone's attention was focused on the cylinder on the table.

We squeezed in, but Ah Bing pulled my sleeve and said softly:

"There are so many people again, only five will be drawn in total, I'm afraid we won't get our share again."

Suddenly, everyone became silent – the drawing of lots began.

Then, the fair person called out according to the list of conscripted soldiers:

"×××"

Another fair person then immediately used chopsticks to clip a paper ball into the cylinder, opened it and called out: "None" or "Yes"

Time passed, and those whose fate had been decided gradually left here. Suddenly, Ah Bing stretched his neck long, listening intently, and then, a smile appeared on his face – we all heard a voice "Yes!"

Another fair person wrote "Li Ah Bing's" name on the conscripted soldiers' register...

People had already dispersed, and Big Sheng and I had missed out again!

Walking out of the township office, our footsteps sounded heavy; "Confusion" always flashed in Big Sheng's and my minds: "Ah! We have to wait another month before we can draw lots again."

Ah Bing became particularly active. He talked about how Brother Jianmin hid from his wife and mother to join the army; how Miss Suwen bravely became a female soldier; his face flushed red:

"Waiting for this training period to join the army; at that time, hmph! Li Ah Bing will cut those old bastards with one knife...!" He slammed his palm hard on Big Sheng's neck, but Big Sheng's hand pinched him hard, and Ah Bing only screamed in pain.

Everyone smiled at each other again, looking at the distant mountains and rivers blurred, our mood was quiet – but our blood surged again – confident: we will become soldiers sooner or later; we will gallop on the battlefield.

It was already dusk, the sky was shrouded in dimness, but the earth here was still beautiful...

### The American WPA Art Movement (Part 1)

— Bai Ying

Since President Roosevelt came to power, his greatest policy has been the New Deal Progress Administration, known worldwide. This is a branch of the New Deal movement.

The work included in the WPA in the arts includes:

FAP (Federal Art Project)

FMP (Federal Music Project)

FTP (Federal Theater Project)

FWP (Federal Writers' Project)

When President Roosevelt promoted his new policy, he established a Public Works Administration (PWA), and the WPA was directly under this bureau. The original purpose of establishing the Public Works Administration was to provide relief to the unemployed, so all the work in its subordinate fields was also aimed at providing relief to the unemployed. The WAP is naturally no exception, but if today we still view the four major art works under the WPA as aimed at relieving unemployment, then that is wrong. Because this kind of art movement has today developed its independent meaning. Here is a brief description of the recent situation of the four major art movements:

FAP's New Art Movement – The characteristic of FAP's works is that they no longer target artists or art lovers as the target of their works, but instead take the art of the national community as the foundation and directly depict the life of the American people.

In the early days, the artistic freedom of artists was still biased towards socialist interpretations. For example, the mural of the Rockefeller Center in New York once had Diego Rivera paint a portrait of Lenin, which caused quite a controversy at the time. Later, this portrait was withdrawn, but Rivera's works elsewhere were still accepted.

Because there are no galleries, in addition to mural work, they have also established dozens of galleries in the southern, midwestern, and western United States, displaying the works of famous artists and local painters, open every day until nine o'clock at night, on the one hand creating new appreciation crowds, and at the same time providing guidance to local painters, so this movement has become an individual cultural movement, and is no longer purely unemployment relief.

FTP's Theater Movement – The nominal administrator of this movement is Henry Hopkins, and the actual directors are Mrs. Ellen Uterhert and Mrs. Henry Flannigan. In the first two years, expenses of 13.4 million US dollars were paid, with a maximum of 12,500 participants, and now there are 9,000. This is because some states now not only feel that there are not enough unemployed actors in the state to hire, but also go to other states to borrow.

FTP has a complex understanding of audience requirements and the different specialties of actors, so its repertoire contains 28,000 types from ancient Greek dramas to contemporary costume dramas, including Shakespearean dramas, social dramas, pantomimes, dance dramas, and other aspects.

### Pen

— Wan Yu

In an era of bloody storms, it is not permissible for Sakyamuni to advocate those doctrines that enable mankind to become Buddhas, because "lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha on the spot" and other such decadent tunes are absolutely unsuitable for this era. Obviously, today's China is the dividing line of all prosperity and decline, and also the critical moment of all life and death. In order to win the needs of the entire nation, it is natural to have to start a national struggle of mass slaughter. China's current targets of slaughter are two: one is to destroy the powerful enemy of all mankind, and the other is to eliminate the dregs of the entire nation; and these two points can also be said: the former is external, and the latter is internal.

However, what are the tools for killing?

Undoubtedly, what the soldiers hold in their hands are knives and guns, steel and sulfur; while the literati only have a pen tip that is only an inch long.

Don't think that the pen is a useless thing, it can only write about the West Chamber, write about the Dream of the Red Chamber, write about the Golden Lotus, write about smiling dimples, write about triangular male and female romances; similarly, it can also kill people. In history, the pen has long been used as a tool for killing, and at that time, the pen's killing work may be called pen execution. Isn't that right? "Others carry precious swords, I have a pen like a knife," how loud and cheerful does it sound?

It is a pity that although the pen in history can kill people, the targets killed are neither broad nor many; the crimes of the killed are not clear, and even mistakes are made, and there are even wrongful killings. In addition, because the killing is not done properly, it is often the case that it cannot be performed thoroughly and to the satisfaction of the people. Are these all the faults of the pen? Naturally not, only because the people who use it lack a little observation and a little skill. Therefore, although the pen can be used as a sharp weapon for killing, the problem still lies in the skill of the person holding the pen; the situation is similar: any knife or gun can kill people, and the final key depends on the executioner's killing technique.

Now, fresh blood has stained the rivers and mountains, and the mass slaughter has already begun. Whether externally or internally, all descendants of the Yellow Emperor should stand firm in their positions and carry out this sacred task. Then the authors standing on the cultural frontier should not forget the responsibility of using the pen as a knife!

Look: those things that put on airs; those things that wag their tails; those things that play tricks; and those things that look like humans but are not human... all have to use sharp pen tips to dissect their bellies and reveal the secrets in their hearts; cut off their heads and pour out the black curtain in their heads. Authors must absolutely use the pen to make all the ugly monsters show their true forms when they see it, and from then on dare not be rampant, so that the pen can add some historical feats to the national struggle of mass slaughter, and at the same time let the pen cultivate a little brilliant embellishment on the journey of Chinese culture!

Entertainment World

### Playwrights and Performers

— Li Amao

Playwrights and performers, these two kinds of people, should be united and work together, and can never be separated, just like a car has two wheels, and it is difficult to move if one is missing.

Therefore, in all countries of the world, these playwrights and performers, without exception, complement each other, and so is China, it was so in ancient times, and it is so recently; however, there are six or seventy years in between, when playwrights and performers completely went their separate ways.

In ancient China, the drama was most popular, of course, in the Yuan Dynasty. The drama at that time was what is now called Yuanqu, that is, the Kunqu opera. The lyrics of Kunqu opera are very high, so naturally, those without considerable literary cultivation cannot write them; but the conditions for cooperation between the two parties are very easy. On the script, only the singing lines and dialogues are written out, and handed over to the opera troupe, and they will perform it, and all the actions and expressions are taken care of by themselves using experience and skills. As for the lyrics, as long as there is the name of the tune, there is a way to handle it. Therefore, in the era when Kunqu opera was popular, from the Yuan Dynasty to the Qianqing Hongyang era, for hundreds of years, both parties cooperated in this way. Without actors, the playwright's works would only be for people to appreciate on paper; without playwrights, the actors would not have new things to come out.

However, Kunqu opera is high-brow and attracts few followers, and can only be enjoyed by the intellectual class, and is definitely not for the masses, so its life cannot be long after all. Later, it was revolutionized by the popular Huiju and Peking opera, causing a storm. Once these popular things became popular, there was no room for playwrights to intervene. The actors themselves could handle those vulgar sentences, so naturally there was no need for playwrights. Therefore, playwrights and performers, although like lips and teeth dependent on each other, in this era, were completely separated, in other words: there was no existence of playwrights.

Even if one or two literati, occasionally happy, wanted to write a script for them, they would take it and would not be able to use it at all. Because their consistent method is that whenever they write a new play, they don't need any script, they only write an "outline." On this "outline," only the names of the people in each scene are written, and there is no plot at all. They only rely on the person who directs the play to speak with an expert tone to tell them, and that's it. So it is definitely not something that outsiders can do. If an outsider wants to direct a play for them, then there are many difficulties. For example, in the first scene, someone comes on stage. Then the actor asks: How do I come on stage? Still rushing wind? Still fish at the bottom of the water? Still playing the lead? Still singing? Still playing the small gong? He said all kinds of things, and the playwright was already scared. In case there are a few people who think that this outsider is coming to take the job of the insider, then there will inevitably be things like eating tofu happening. If a playwright must plan to write a play with them, then he must first become an insider himself; but this is not an easy thing, so this kind can be said to be very, very few, we only saw one Ouyang Yuqian.

Playwrights and performers are naturally complementary, how can they not cooperate? The reason why old dramas have not progressed in recent years is mostly here. Especially in Shanghai, old dramas and Hollywood films are placed in front of the audience at the same time, and when compared in terms of thought, the difference is naturally too great.

However, recently, spoken dramas and movies are popular, and these two kinds of things, they fully cooperate with playwrights, and fundamentally they cannot be established without good scripts. The so-called good scripts are not the transformation of scenes, but how the thoughts are. With good scripts, the performers have a basis to give play to their talents and experiences. Performers who can understand the spirit and meaning of the script can create a good play. The more the two parties cooperate, the better the results.

Casual Talk About Spoken Drama

### Impressions of the Green Treasure Theater

— Xuan

Vigorously Developing Is the Only New Type of Theater

Although drama is an art, on the other hand, it is also a noble entertainment needed by the general public. Therefore, no matter what kind of drama, it should take the premise of improving society and correcting all bad customs and habits, and become a noble entertainment that is beneficial to intelligence and health; it must enable the audience to obtain the true meaning of entertainment at a very small price. I am a lover of spoken drama, so I am happy to talk about spoken drama.

It cannot be said that there are few spoken drama venues at sea, but if you want to find a place that is both elegant and popular and somewhat satisfactory, then after the opening of the "Drama Theater", it has released a different color for the Shanghai spoken drama scene, and can be said to be a new type of spoken drama theater in Shanghai, so I excitedly watched it several times in a row, and finally did not make

No matter what kind of public entertainment venue, if it can truly gain a good reputation, it is definitely not something that can be achieved by relying solely on one-sided propaganda or subjective praise from a few people. It must be shown to the public to be appreciated by all. Therefore, the current "Green Treasure Theater" already has a bright and splendid position, and is vigorously developing. The reason why "Green Treasure" can have such achievements today, as I see it, is probably due to the following two reasons:

First: the greatness of the organizers' spirit of serving society. "Green Treasure" is organized by New New Company. Because of the strong capital and suitable location, all the equipment is far superior to other theaters, and it is naturally able to attract the audience. In addition, the company's management is strict, so it is very satisfactory in terms of seats, scenery, lighting, and props. This point is recognized by everyone. Now there is a panic about scripts everywhere, and "Green Treasure" is able to select and perform newly compiled famous plays in a brand-new posture, looking down on the entire Shanghai spoken drama scene. This is its characteristic.

Second: the excellence and neatness of the troupe's talents - the backstage of "Green Treasure" is jointly responsible by Chen Qiufeng, Wang Manjun, and Liu Yixin, who are entrusted by the company's authorities. They are all all-rounders in the drama and art world. Under their clever design and leadership, all the actors have the opportunity to fully develop their individual performances, so every play has achieved a vivid and realistic harvest. In terms of actors, men such as Liu Yixin, Wang Manjun, Gu Menghu, Qin Haha, Tian Xiaoqing, Hu Liaoran, Wang Shanquiao, Luo Fei, Hu Shiqi, etc., each have their own strengths. Female roles such as Fan Xuepeng, Qian Aili, Tian Xin, Wang Bing, Wang Aina, Cai Juanjuan, Lu Ping, Li Ping, Qian Zhen, Qian Huixia, etc., are either naturally charming, or beautiful and gentle, or dignified and calm, or petite and exquisite, or innocent and romantic, and are all rare people.

"Green Treasure Theater" has the above two reasons, so its achievements have also progressed rapidly. Now the words "Green Treasure" have been deeply imprinted in the minds of Shanghai ladies. It has become the authority of spoken drama at sea, and it can proudly look down on its peers and be proud of itself.

However, to put it back, drama changes with the times, and if you don't advance, you retreat. I hope that the authorities and artists of the theater will not be complacent because they have a position, but should continue to work hard and move forward. At the same time, I hope that the playwrights will write more famous plays that are beneficial to the world and the people, so that the masses in the isolated island can invisibly get spiritual edification in entertainment. This is my sincere wish.

### Red Star's "Sunrise" Ms. Gu Han Holds Two Positions

— Hong Huang

After Miss Gu Han performed "Night of Joy" at the Red Star Luanchang, she continued to play the leading role of Xiao Lilian in "Ren Zhi Chu". Her fluent and clear dialogue, profound and natural acting skills, are unanimously recognized by the art world as a promising talent. It is said that she is studying music, so her performance is full of beautiful rhythm.

After "Thunderstorm", Red Star will stage the famous play "Sunrise". Because she was alone in "Ren Zhi Chu" and helped Red Star a lot, the main leader Wang Yigong will personally play the role of Manager Pan to show his respect to Miss Gu. Because the rehearsal of "Sunrise" is led by Miss Gu, who will play the leading role of the social butterfly Chen Bailu, she is naturally very suitable for Xiao Lilian in "Ren Zhi Chu". However, some people in the troupe insisted that she play the role of Xiao Dongxi, and now Miss Gu has agreed to try it. When Miss Gu plays the leading role of Chen Bailu, Wang Yigong plays Manager Pan; when Chen Bailu is played by Bai Yan, Miss Gu plays the role of Xiao Dongxi.

Not to mention the spoken drama, the audience of the movie "Sunrise" is also quite large. Lu Luming's Chen Bailu, Yuan Meiyun's Xiao Dongxi, these two are very different roles. Gu Han will hold two positions, and one is the leading role and the other is the supporting role. Miss Gu's contribution to the spoken drama world will release a brilliant brilliance.

### Fan Xuepeng Almost Suffered an Accident

— Ku Er

——Almost Sacrificed for "The Ambition of Jasper"

Fan Xuepeng, the pillar of the Green Treasure Theater, recently starred in a film for Yihua Company, named "The Ambition of Jasper". Fan played a social butterfly in the play, and her performance was very lewd. She first married Wang Naidong, and later suddenly took a fancy to Wang Yin, and even put her ex-husband in prison. Her vicious performance was extremely detailed. Recently, the film was shooting the scene where Wang Naidong broke out of prison and returned home to kill Fan Xuepeng. At that time, Fan was feeling a little unwell, but in order for the company to finish the film as soon as possible, she insisted on filming while sick. She can be said to have done her best for art. Unexpectedly, when Wang Naidong fired a shot to kill Fan, the gunpowder of the blank bullet in the gun was too strong. With a loud bang, Fan fell to the ground. The staff thought that Fan Xuepeng was pretending to fall, and sighed that her performance was very realistic. Suddenly, they heard Fan moaning on the ground? Director Yue Feng was very surprised and rushed to see her, and saw blood stains on Fan's arm, and then realized that she was injured. He immediately bandaged her and sent her home, fortunately without any major problems. However, Green Treasure lost several days because of this. Fan once said to others, "The Ambition of Jasper" is her life's work, and it turns out that there was such a risky process.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (86)

— Xu Muyun

Guo Zhongheng was Gong Yunfu's Yin-Yang Follower

At that time, Fengqing was already decadent and weak, not like a person. When he sang, he only saw his head swaying and his eyes wide open. Although the taste was good, unfortunately, he could only sit in the front row and occasionally hear a sentence or two. Therefore, Zhongheng had the opportunity to rush up. Therefore, the first criticism of coming to Shanghai was not bad. Unfortunately, later his hobby was too deep, and the more he smoked, the fatter his body became. Not only was he weak and his voice dry, but he gradually declined, and he often made mistakes. By the time he and Da Yuanfu Quan had disagreements with Cheng Laosi at the same time and left Yanqiu's troupe, his reputation also declined from then on. As the saying goes: If you can't achieve high, you can't achieve low, and Guo Erye suffered from these six words. In the few years before his death, he simply couldn't get a job, and his hobby harmed him.

Although Zhongheng's medical skills were not very good, they were still passable. Usually, if someone in the same profession had a sudden illness, and it was impossible to invite or could not afford to invite a doctor in the middle of the night, as long as they gave him a call, even if he was already asleep on the kang, he would immediately get up, put on his clothes, and go straight to the patient's house. He would diagnose the pulse and give injections, all without cash, and he would have to pay for the medicine himself. Therefore, his popularity in the Pear Garden industry was indeed not bad. Especially Grandma Gong, known as Fengguan, would call Guo Erye to see a doctor every three to five days. If he occasionally performed in Pingjin, he would have to bring Zhongheng with him first, unwilling to go on stage. One year, when the Du family's ancestral hall was completed, except for Shu Yan, all the famous actors from Beiping came south. Yunfu was old and didn't want to come, but later he was still encouraged by Zhongheng, who said that with me as a bodyguard, there would be no mistakes. Lao Gong then boldly set off, and returned safely to the north after the play. In less than two years, Gong and Guo died one after another. Colleagues said that Guo Erye went to the underworld to be a guard with Lao Gong.
