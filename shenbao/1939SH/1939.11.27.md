Chongqing: The report of the fall of Nanning has not yet been confirmed. According to recent military dispatches from the front in Guangxi Province, fierce fighting is currently taking place in the suburbs of Nanning. A unit of Japanese troops, on the morning of November 23rd, passed through the gap between Yangshan (transliteration) and the Shiwan (100,000) Mountains, reaching the outskirts of Nanning. On the same day, Japanese aircraft and heavy artillery heavily bombarded the city, covering their troops as they crossed the Yu River. It is claimed that the Japanese advance troops were once driven back to the south bank, but later, reinforced by three divisions of fresh troops, they finally crossed the river again under the cover of a large number of Japanese aircraft in the evening of the same day. Chinese troops firmly defended the eastern suburb positions, and the two armies repeatedly charged and counter-charged in the western suburbs of the city. The positions were lost and regained as many as eight times. Casualties on both sides were very heavy. The Guilin Chinese Army Headquarters has just issued a notice urging the public not to be alarmed by the situation in Nanning, stating that this is only one stage in a carefully prepared plan, and the battle will inevitably have new developments.

The defending Chinese troops fought bravely in bloody battles, repeatedly engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Casualties on both sides were heavy. (26th Dispatch)

Hong Kong: Guangxi dispatches state that confused fighting is occurring near Yongning (Nanning), but details are unclear. Military experts believe that the Guangxi authorities have made clever arrangements, and their military strength is sufficient to block the Japanese advance. Moreover, the Guangxi mountains are crisscrossed, making it difficult for the Japanese to maintain contact with their rear, and they are bound to suffer a major setback. (26th Special Dispatch)

Chongqing: General Chen Cheng, Political Minister of the Military Affairs Commission, gave a speech yesterday to six patriotic cultural organizations here, stating that the Japanese invasion of Guangxi is advantageous to the Chinese army, as it further lengthens the Japanese front lines. He also stated that time is an important factor in determining modern warfare, and anyone unable to wage a war of attrition will eventually fail. Because time is an important factor, the longer we fight, the stronger we become. At the same time, the wider the war zone spreads, the more beneficial it is for us. Therefore, the Japanese decision to invade Guangxi provides us with another opportunity to deplete the Japanese army. (26th United Press Dispatch)

Guilin: The Guilin Consultative Council sent telegrams to the consultative councils of various counties, which were then forwarded to township and town people's representative assemblies and elders, stating that at this critical moment when the enemy is pressing on the border, our brave Guangxi soldiers are duty-bound to serve on the battlefield and bear the responsibility of defending their homeland.

We must ensure that the rice of Guangxi is not eaten by the Japanese, the water of Guangxi is not drunk by the Japanese, the houses of Guangxi are not inhabited by the Japanese, and the roads of Guangxi are not traveled by the Japanese, creating a victory even greater than that in northern Hunan.

Editorial

### American Opposition to Sanctions Against Japan

From today until the U.S. Congress reconvenes and the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty expires, there is less than two months left. During this period, the domestic political disputes in the United States will likely center on the issue of Japan.

The U.S. handling of Japanese atrocities has entered an important stage with the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty. Judging from the attitude of the current U.S. government, it is firm and clear: for the past two and a half years, it has repeatedly issued memoranda or verbal warnings and protests, all to no avail and with no effect. On July 25 of this year, it announced the termination of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, with a six-month period, that is, from now in another two months until January 26 of next year, the treaty will expire. On the 22nd of this month, Undersecretary of State Welles stated that, in view of Japan's failure to correct its atrocities, the United States will no longer negotiate a new treaty with it. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has also introduced a bill to authorize the President to prohibit the transportation of ordnance, ammunition, kerosene, and various metals and metal mixtures to Japan, which is violating the Nine-Power Treaty. These are the more obvious political measures; intimations to Japan in the military sphere are too numerous to mention. As for the actions after the commercial treaty expires, there is no need to speculate on the specific content now; even in terms of the basis for the actions, there are two different approaches: one is the activation of executive power, that is, the President issues an order to carry it out; the other is the activation of legislative power, that is, Congress enacts a law to carry it out; either one or both can be taken. The activation of executive power has great power in fact; for example, imposing prohibitions through taxation is equivalent to prohibition. The activation of legislative power has no limits in scope, and its nature is stricter and more absolute; for example, it is enshrined in law, and strict prohibitions are in place. Moreover, it does not have to be limited to prohibition; the legislator possesses supreme power, depending on what its intentions are. Given Japan's long-standing recklessness and unwillingness to repent, it is truly urgent to treat it with decisive orders from the U.S. President. It is also hoped that the U.S. Congress will jointly establish a way to punish it, emphasizing the effectiveness of containing violence. As the matter concerns Congress, even though the attitude of the ruling party is firm and clear, attention must still be paid to the attitude of the opposition party.

U.S. politics has two parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, which rise and fall in turn. Currently, the Democratic Party's Roosevelt is in charge of national affairs as President, and the Republican Party is in opposition. The two parties contend with each other when discussing politics, which is the normal state of party politics and cannot be considered strange or criticized. However, on the U.S. Far East policy, the two parties can still abandon their sectarian prejudices, because their attitudes are not fundamentally incompatible. Among them, there is a distinct group called the isolationists. The isolationists are found in both parties. The isolationist elements belonging to the Republican Party in opposition have a rather stubborn attitude due to the dual factors of "isolationist advocacy" and "opposition status." Among them, Senator Borah of the Democratic Party is particularly headstrong.

Recently, Borah and others have issued statements opposing the use of economic means to retaliate against Japan, saying that "trade between the United States and Japan is progressing, and we should not lightly abandon this commerce for no sufficient reason." It is expected that from now until the end of the deliberation of the anti-Japan bill after Congress reconvenes, opposition arguments similar to Borah's will continue to emerge. Although public opinion polls in the United States have proven that the vast majority of the public supports actively sanctioning Japan, the opposition cannot violate public sentiment in theory, and even for the sake of their political lives, they dare not go against public sentiment. Therefore, the opposition will certainly not be able to gain the upper hand. Even in terms of the number of seats in both houses of Congress, the opposition is only a minority and cannot achieve anything. Even if the anti-Japan bill is thwarted in Congress, it will not be able to obstruct the wise authorities from activating executive power within the scope allowed by their duties. Therefore, when the time comes, the U.S. action against Japanese atrocities will inevitably be firm and clear. Moreover, even those like Borah do not fundamentally condone Japanese atrocities or make distorted defenses of atrocities. However, there are still factors that can covertly agitate and conspire to incite opposition: first, using the issue of Japan as a tool for political struggle, especially since there will be competitive elections next year, there is a possibility of extreme abuse through distortion and utilization. Second, those engaged in trade with Japan seek immediate and private gains, disregarding the long-term, disregarding the principles of justice, and especially disregarding the fact that profits are blood and tears. Third, Japan spends tens of millions in propaganda every year, and now that it is facing a serious juncture, it cannot be that there will be no effect at all. Fourth, there are schemers who roam internationally and propagate the idea that sanctioning Japan would strengthen the collusion of militaristic aggressors, which would cause even deeper troubles, so it is better to open the net and appease them to mitigate the disaster. These four factors can help to promote shameless opposition.

However, the American opposition to sanctions against Japan will eventually be shattered. Of all arguments, those that can occupy a vast space and time, gain the popular support, and be immortalized are exceptional. If it is only the opinion of one family, some people will always believe in it, and it must have some merit in its unsoundness. But the opposition to sanctions against Japan has none. Even like Borah's statement, he does not defend Japanese atrocities, nor does he advocate that the United States accept violence and withdraw from the Far East. He only passively opposes economic retaliation, and there is absolutely no active suggestion to explain how the United States should deal with Japanese atrocities? How should the United States protect itself in the Far East? This exposes the failure of the opposition to possess the necessary conditions for establishing a theory. Moreover, the so-called not lightly abandoning trade with Japan seems to be a consideration of commercial interests. Then it has not considered the current commercial interests with China, as well as the long-term commercial interests when China wins the war of resistance and engages in reconstruction. This exposes the opposition's lack of skill in calculation. Dong Xian Guang once criticized Borah for only seeing "blood money," which is a piercingly accurate comment. If one only seeks profit from blood money, it may be justifiable in terms of egoism. But one should know that the one who supplies this blood money is plotting to destroy the other big customer of the United States, the one with the greatest hope. Then, to seize this blood money is no different from cutting one's own flesh. If one is willing to stop at cutting one's own flesh for the sake of the current blood money, one may still be able to do it. But have you not heard the Japanese roaring at the United States two weeks ago? They almost wanted to strangle the United States, only regretting that their feathers were not yet full. Helping the aggressors is helping them grow their feathers. Then, the blood money is not just obtained by cutting one's own flesh. It can also be regarded as selling one's life and pre-paying the price.

### Products Manufactured in Guerrilla Areas Not Allowed to Be Imported into the Interior; Only Various Raw Materials Allowed to Be Imported Freely

Chongqing: According to sources here today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has issued an order stating that from now on, all manufactured products from guerrilla areas, including those manufactured in Shanghai, will not be allowed to be imported into the areas controlled by the Chinese government. The reason for this policy adopted by the Chinese government is that it is very difficult to distinguish between Japanese goods and Chinese goods in guerrilla areas in fact. The factories in guerrilla areas are mostly nominally controlled by Chinese, but in fact, they are mostly controlled by the Japanese, and most of the raw materials used also come from Japan. However, raw materials from guerrilla areas can still be freely imported into areas controlled by the government. (26th United Press Dispatch)

### Japanese Prime Minister Delivers Speech; Wants to Resolve the China Incident; Says It Will Take Five to Ten Years

Tokyo: Prime Minister Abe delivered a speech at a banquet in Osaka today, stating that some people believe that the resolution of the China Incident means the establishment of a "new central government" in China, the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, and the withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in China, which is a great misconception. The resolution of the China Incident is not that simple. Chiang currently has an army of 240 divisions, plus over one million guerrillas. If the economic problems of the whole nation, the attitudes of the various countries, and how to deal with Chiang's troops are all considered, we must be prepared to deal with a situation that may take five to ten years to completely resolve the China Incident. The control of the economy should be strengthened to deal with the various difficulties caused by the China Incident. Abe concluded by saying that Japan is willing to shake hands with countries that support the same position, but should not be overly reliant on them. (26th Reuters Dispatch)

### Pittman States that the U.S. Should Not Accommodate Japan; Ban on Exports to Japan Expected to Pass

Washington: Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated to the press yesterday that U.S.-Japan relations "are deteriorating," and the government is determined not to "appease" Japan. He will propose in the next session of Congress to authorize the President to issue an order to cease trade with Japan. Pittman continued, "I do not yet feel there is a need for appeasement. According to information I have received, Japan continues to undermine American rights in China. If Japan cannot comply with the terms of the Nine-Power Treaty, it is futile for us to renew a new commercial treaty with them." Pittman denied rumors circulating outside that members of the Foreign Relations Committee favor a conciliatory attitude towards Japan. "The government at present will not initiate any action externally, and takes this attitude towards the commercial treaty. The State Department's notification to Japan of the cancellation of the commercial treaty is intended to stop trade with Japan, and the Senate will certainly pass this. The United States will retaliate against those who violate treaties with the United States. Stopping trade will not affect American neutrality. If the material circumstances do not change, I am determined to bring about the cessation of trade with Japan as soon as possible." (United Press dispatch dated 26th)

Washington: Republican Senators Vandenberg and Borah recently made statements opposing economic retaliation against Japan. Democratic Senator Pittman (Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) responded, stating that his proposal in July of this year, which advocated authorizing the President to prohibit the shipment of arms, ammunition, kerosene, and various metals and metal mixtures to countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty (referring to Japan), is sure to gain sufficient votes when brought before the Senate for discussion in the future. Regarding this matter, because most senators are not currently in Washington, it is difficult to estimate how many support Pittman's proposal. However, senators in the Congressional recess chambers generally believe that opinions are now divided regarding the U.S. policy towards Japan: one faction advocates allowing the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty to expire on January 26, 1940, without renewing it; the other advocates establishing a temporary commercial treaty to make it more convenient for the U.S. and other related countries to try to discuss general issues in the Far East with Japan. It is known in the State Department that a majority of people in Japan are very willing to begin negotiations with the U.S. In addition, Japan's trade with European belligerents is becoming increasingly difficult, and its economic reliance on the U.S. is also increasing. Therefore, the U.S. is in a very advantageous position and need not rush to express its attitude. (Havas dispatch dated 25th)

Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman today predicted that Congress will approve his proposed bill authorizing the President to prohibit the export of goods to Japan. He hopes for the re-establishment of a peaceful situation in the East, but he sees no reason why the U.S. should compromise with Japan in action or even in expression. According to reports, Pittman disclosed a few months ago that he had submitted a joint resolution to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, authorizing the President to restrict exports to any country that violates the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing the territorial and administrative integrity of China. Congress has repeatedly discussed it, recognizing this approach as an economic action against Japan's activities in China. The purpose of the bill is specifically to cut off the supply of military supplies to Japan, such as weapons, ammunition, and war materials, including steel, kerosene, gasoline, scrap iron, and scrap metal.

### Manila Conference of an Advisory Nature to Discuss U.S. Interests in China

Washington: Officials here recognize the meeting in Manila between the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Hurd, and the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, as a routine annual meeting of U.S. leaders in the Far East, but they do not underestimate the importance of the extraordinary situation in Asia, which serves as the background for the meeting. Officials here stated that the Commander of the U.S. Army in Asia also regularly attends the meetings, and that when they do not hold meetings, the leaders exchange information to conduct useful reviews of different actions. They acknowledge that many new circumstances have arisen in the Far East, but decline to make specific criticisms. Although observers here regard the Manila Conference as extremely important, they believe that the final U.S. policy is largely determined by the people and Congress, and partly by the President. Therefore, the Manila Conference, at most, is of an advisory nature, or to assist in the implementation of established policies. Unofficial criticisms state that the Manila Conference can at least indicate that the U.S. has broad interests in the Far East, and that these interests have been directly affected by the turmoil caused by the war situation. They also point out that Manila is the center of U.S. interests in Asia, including a wide range of military facilities. It is believed here that the meeting provides the first opportunity for Admiral Hurd and Mr. Gauss to meet since Mr. Sayre took office. It is generally believed that the meeting will address all aspects of U.S. interests, such as U.S.-Japan relations, U.S. relations with the Dutch East Indies, and the issue of U.S. interests in China due to the establishment of a "new Chinese government." It is intended here to use the meeting report to determine the acute situation of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty and the U.S. defense plan. (United Press dispatch dated 22nd)

### The U.S. Must Retain the Philippines: The Only Barrier to Peace in the Far East

Indianapolis: U.S. Federal Security Administrator McNutt stated in a speech here yesterday that if the U.S. wishes to maintain peace, it must protect its interests in the Far East and not shy away from the world's current problems. According to McNutt, the Philippines is a barrier to peace in the Far East. As long as the Philippine flag flies under the U.S. flag, no one will dare to invade and violate it.

### U.S. Fleet Should Remain in the Pacific, U.S. Acting Secretary of the Navy Suggests Due to Unsettled Situation in the Far East

Washington: Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison released his annual report today, advocating retaining most of the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, saying that the fleet has the greatest opportunity for tactical training in the Pacific. But in addition, there are more important reasons, such as the unrest in the Far East, and the failure of the Allied Powers to maintain a strong fleet in the Far East. For many years, the U.S. has opposed dividing the Navy equally between the Atlantic and Pacific, and would rather station the Navy in the Pacific, due to strategic considerations. In terms of expenditure, a navy in both oceans is even less advisable. (Reuters dispatch dated 25th)

San Francisco: According to General Clarence, publisher of the Seattle Times and commander of the U.S. artillery regiment in the last European War, he stated today that although we do not want to be drawn into the vortex of war, seeking only not to be drawn into the vortex of war will put the country in danger. Therefore, the U.S. should adopt the following policies: (1) In addition to the currently established shipbuilding program, at least six to eight more battleships should be built. Although aircraft and submarines are formidable, it is battleships that can control the oceans. (2) The standing army should be expanded to 600,000, 400,000 of whom should be permanently stationed in the U.S., and plans should be made to cultivate senior military talent. (3) Expand the National Guard to 600,000, so that there is a reserve force for the regular army. (4) Expand the militia, so that the country can mobilize 1.5 million troops in the event of an emergency. Of course, all of this cannot be done without money, but after spending the money, no country will dare to interfere with U.S. policy, which is the greatest investment in peace. Finally, he said that after the last war, the U.S. abandoned its policy of maritime supremacy, which was a major mistake. If the U.S. had not abandoned its policy of a large navy, then when Japan invaded China, the U.S. could have ordered Japan to withdraw from China immediately. But having abandoned the policy of a large navy, we can only stand idly by regarding all of Japan's actions. (United Press dispatch dated 26th)

### Japan Recently Purchased Military Supplies from the U.S. Worth 3.8 Million Gold

### German Air Force Attacked British Fleet in the North Sea Twice Yesterday, German Side Claims Four British Ships Heavily Damaged, British Aircraft Reconoiter German Naval Base

Berlin: Official documents last night stated that the German Air Force bombed the British Navy in the northern North Sea today, 900 kilometers from the German coast. British anti-aircraft guns roared, but ultimately failed to hit the German aircraft. Four British warships were hit by bombs and heavily damaged, while the German aircraft returned safely to their original defenses. (Haitong dispatch dated 26th)

Berlin: The German High Command issued an official report today, declaring that there was only localized artillery fire on the Western Front. The German Air Force flew to the North Sea yesterday to bomb the British fleet, hitting four British ships, including a giant cruiser. The German Air Force also flew far to bomb the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland. Enemy aircraft attempted to sneak into German territory from Helgoland yesterday and were repelled by German anti-aircraft guns. The German Air Force suffered no losses yesterday, but patrol boat "No. 301" was sunk by bombing, and all sixteen sailors were killed. (Haitong dispatch dated 26th)

London: The Aviation Ministry recently issued a bulletin stating, "Our aircraft groups flew to northwestern Germany again yesterday, especially to the ports of Wilhelmshaven and Heligoland, and achieved very good results. Enemy anti-aircraft gun teams fired fiercely at our aircraft in many places." (Havas dispatch dated 26th)

Danzig: A German official news agency stated that when German bombers attacked the British naval fleet about 560 miles off the German North Sea coast yesterday, they saw four British ships directly hit by bombs. Although the German aircraft encountered intense anti-aircraft fire, they all flew back to their original defenses without damage. According to reports, this German announcement is completely opposite to the communique issued by the British Navy Department in London. According to the communique, German aircraft attacked the British fleet in the North Sea twice, dropping many bombs, but none of them hit, and the British suffered no casualties. (Reuters dispatch dated 26th)

London: A German Heinkel bomber flew over the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland this afternoon. Local anti-aircraft gun teams immediately opened fire, but the enemy aircraft did not drop any bombs and flew away. Later, an air raid alarm was issued on the Orkney Islands, and German aircraft groups appeared nearby, but did not fly over the islands and flew away after 45 minutes. No bombs were dropped. According to some observers, the aircraft may have laid mines at sea. (Havas dispatch dated 25th)

### German Aircraft Reconnoitered French Territory, Lost Seven Aircraft

It is reported that four aircraft appeared to have been shot down in French territory, two were forced to land, and another was missing. (Reuters dispatch dated 26th)

### The Western Front is Quiet, Only Scout Teams Active

Paris: The General Headquarters recently released War Report No. 167, stating, "Our scout teams were active in the Vosges Mountains last night." (Havas dispatch dated 26th)

Paris: The latest French communique states that the Western Front was quiet and uneventful yesterday. According to briefings from the front lines, the main military action in the past 24 hours was a German night raid ten miles east of the Moselle River, but it failed. Two German groups, nearly a mile apart, set off at the same time. The first group rushed into a machine gun fire network and was almost completely wiped out. The second group was scattered under French artillery fire, and French patrols subsequently captured several prisoners. (Reuters dispatch dated 26th)

### Analysis of the British and French Economic Cooperation Plan by German Officials

Berlin: German official documents stated yesterday that the pound continues to plummet. In the past 14 months, gold worth approximately 300 million U.S. dollars has been shipped from London to New York. The British have lost so much gold that they dare not let the people know the truth. According to official observations here, the main purpose of the new British-French understanding is to protect the currency systems of the two countries. Therefore, France will mobilize a reserve of 100 billion francs to support the British currency system, not only to pay for its own expenses in purchasing military supplies in the United States, but also to pay for the British orders for military supplies in the United States. France will also allow Britain to set the exchange rate between the French franc and the British pound to pay for the expenses of the British army in France. German officials reiterated that France's need for food is not very dependent on foreign imports, while 80% of Britain's food is imported from overseas. Therefore, the German naval war will pose a greater threat to Britain. In the future, France will not only have to supply the British troops fighting in France with food produced in its own country, but also have to provide food relief to the people of England. In view of this, Britain is pleased with the opportunity for Britain and France to sign a new commercial agreement. Once this economic cooperation is realized, an economic crisis will follow.

### The Soviet-Finnish Dispute Is Unlikely to Lead to War: Netherlands Has Heaven, Earth, and Harmony, Three Baltic States Plan to Mediate

Helsinki Telegraph: According to general observation, although the Soviet Union's demands on Finland have not been met, it may not necessarily wage war on Finland. The reasons are as follows: (1) The Soviet Union has now obtained defensive points in the Baltic Sea, so whether it will destroy the treaty and damage its international reputation for relatively unimportant locations has become a matter of speculation to some extent. (2) Although the difference in population between the Soviet Union and Finland is vast, the Finnish army has always been a highly trained army, and its morale is also very high. The terrain is also favorable for resistance. If the war is prolonged, it will become a blow to the prestige of the Red Army. (3) The best approach is to wait for an opportunity, because Finland's long-term mobilization will not be able to bear the economic burden. If so, it may shake Finland's determination. According to reporters who inspected the area bordering the Soviet Union, the atmosphere is extremely tense. The lights in all paper mills and rayon factories are not allowed to leak out of the house in the slightest. At the same time, in Finland in winter, the sky becomes dark in the afternoon, and all cars must turn on their lights. Furthermore, the roads in the swampy areas are extremely narrow, and cars cannot pass at all, but the Finnish army is stationed there day and night. In addition, in the past three days, there has been heavy snowfall of three inches thick, and it is expected that even greater snow will fall soon. All of this is heaven's help to Finland. The Finnish border troops are all carrying light machine guns, and sometimes Finnish aircraft circle in the sky. From this situation, it can be seen that a conflict between the Soviet Union and Finland is unlikely to occur in the near future. (Haitong dispatch dated 26th)

Helsinki: According to widespread rumors here today, when the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania met in Tallinn, the three countries intended to mediate the dispute between the Soviet Union and Finland. However, this rumor cannot be confirmed here. According to political observers here, even if the three countries come forward to mediate, it is doubtful whether they will succeed. (United Press dispatch dated 26th)

Moscow: The officialdom here does not want to express opinions on the speech made by Finnish Prime Minister Cajander on Friday, but Soviet newspapers consider the remarks of the Finnish leader to be completely false. "The Finnish reactionaries simply do not want to establish any agreement with the Soviet Union, and they intend to challenge it. In short, if Finland continues its anti-Soviet attitude, the Soviet Union will never accept Finland's reconciliation methods during the period that the Finnish army is not demobilized." At the same time, the Soviet side is very unhappy with the repeated statements of Finnish leaders regarding independence, because the Soviet Union has absolutely no intention of harming Finland's independence. Not only does it have no intention of harming its independence, but the purpose of all the suggestions made by the Soviet side has been to enhance the safety of Finland and the Soviet Union.

### German Police Cross the Border into Dutch Territory to Arrest People, Netherlands Protests, One Dutch Person Killed Among the Four Arrested, Incident Occurred in the Dutch Town of Venlo

Hague: Regarding the Venlo incident on the 9th of this month, the local "Dianwen Daily" recently published the course of events, stating that on that day, a German truck arrived at the German customs near the town of Venlo. Several people dressed as workers jumped off the truck, wielding hoes, and went into the customs officer's office together. When they came out, they had changed into plain clothes, and it was clear that they were disguised German political police. Before long, Dutch Captain Kloppers, along with two British people, drove near the border in a car. The Germans crossed the border into Dutch territory and opened fire on them. Kloppers was killed on the spot. The Dutch driver and the British people were slightly injured. Afterwards, the Germans took the body and the injured people, loaded them onto the truck, and sped away. (Havas dispatch dated 25th)

Hague: German secret police previously crossed the border into Dutch territory on the 9th of this month and abducted two British and two Dutch people in the town of Venlo and took them to Germany. One Dutch person was killed and one was injured. The German semi-official agency, the German News Agency, issued a message regarding this matter, and the Dutch government formally protested to Germany based on this message. The response was that an investigation is currently underway to determine whether the incident occurred in Dutch or German territory. However, the Dutch authorities' investigation results have proven that the case did occur within Dutch territory. In addition, the Dutch oil tanker "Sliedrecht" was also sunk by a German submarine, so the hearts of the Dutch people are very agitated. (Havas dispatch dated 25th)

The Hague: The Dutch government has recently decided to protest to Germany about the incident on the German-Dutch border on November 9 in which Germans crossed the border and injured people. The Dutch government believes that the news published by the German official news agency has proven that the German agency was indeed involved in the case. According to information obtained here, the victim in this case was Lieutenant Kloppers, who was an officer of the Dutch military intelligence service. The other passengers, such as Captain Stevens, and Best and the driver Lemons, survived. However, it is reported that Best and Lemons were injured. According to reports, when the incident occurred, the two British people, Stevens and Best, were planning to enter German territory to negotiate the possibility of peace with the Germans. As for Lieutenant Kloppers, he was a military officer specially appointed by the Dutch government to monitor the actions of the British in order to maintain Dutch neutrality. (Reuters dispatch dated 26th)

Oslo: The 'Aftenposten' here carried the report that British intelligence officer Best often went to Stavanger, Norway, to engage in commerce and work for British intelligence. The newspaper also claimed that he also employed several Norwegians in offices in London and The Hague. (Haitong dispatch dated 20th)

### Italy Warns England and France; New British Blockade Policy Reportedly Understood by the Netherlands

Rome – This morning, all newspapers prominently featured the debate yesterday between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and the British and French ambassadors to Italy regarding Britain's decision to strengthen contraband management. The disclosure of this news, Belgium's diplomatic approach to England, and the dispute over responsibility for the sinking of the "Zhaoguo Maru" show that the Allies' decision to tighten control over contraband is not welcomed by some countries. The "Roman Forum" newspaper published an editorial stating that while it is permissible for any belligerent to adopt retaliatory measures, it is illogical if such measures harm the interests of those outside the war, or drag these interests into the conflict. Italy, as a major power, must safeguard its spiritual and material interests and cannot remain indifferent. (Reuter's dispatch, 26th)

The Hague – The announcement by England and France of a blockade of German export trade has been generally understood here, but it is hoped that Britain can minimize the damage to neutral countries as much as possible. The "Electrical News" recently published an article stating, "Since the neutral countries have made representations to the British government, that government has paid great attention and has expressed its determination not to needlessly increase the difficulties of the neutral countries. This statement should not be taken lightly. However, the extent to which the rights enjoyed by the neutral countries can be preserved is the question. Will Britain stop at an appropriate point to reduce the damage to the neutral countries? I fear that this will be difficult to achieve, because Britain has decided to wage a comprehensive economic war against Germany, and there is no room for leniency. Britain's goal is to cut off German export trade, and the interests of the neutral countries will inevitably be damaged. Regarding this, Italy has proposed a compensation method, and it is rumored that Britain intends to charter Dutch ships to alleviate the damage caused to the Netherlands by the British blockade of German export trade."

### Hitler's Utmost Determination: Intensify Naval Warfare Against England; Increase Mine Production, Expedite Construction of Light Submarines; Warn Neutral Countries Not to Risk Navigation

Berlin – As the European war enters its thirteenth week, the German people are determined to intensify the war effort. The increasing number of ships sunk by torpedoes and mines recently, and the active operations of German reconnaissance aircraft over England and France, have proven that Britain's island nation advantage is a thing of the past. If Germany can disrupt British shipping, Britain will suffer a fatal blow. It is pointed out here that Britain's blockade policy has failed to oppress Germany or force it to adopt Napoleon's Continental System. After being subjected to Germany's naval attacks, Britain has now adopted a new blockade policy, which has provoked protests from neutral countries. According to the "Frankfurt Report", Germany's war aim is to maintain German unity. Germany has been forced to fight repeatedly for a century because its desire to establish a free and unified nation has been suppressed. This threat must be eliminated, and the German people will continue to fight with the utmost determination. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Amsterdam – According to news from Berlin, after studying the results of the first week of unrestricted mine warfare, Hitler has ordered the intensification of this tactic. Hitler believes that mines are currently the most effective weapon and boasts of having used mines to put Britain on the defensive. At the same time, it is heard that German naval shipyards are now working in three shifts, around the clock, to manufacture mobile small submarines and 1,200-ton or larger submarines, which Germany previously neglected. In addition, munitions factories have been ordered to increase the production of the latest types of mines. (Reuter dispatch, 26th)

London – German radio claimed that a certain German newspaper today warned neutral ships that in the future, if German submarines have any doubts about neutral ships, they will be intercepted without leniency, because Germany's only response to British tactics is to launch a large-scale attack without any reservation. (Reuter dispatch, 26th)

London – The diplomatic correspondent of the "Sunday Electrical News" published an article today, stating that the German plan for war against the Allied powers of England and France can now be revealed. This plan was agreed upon by Hitler during a meeting with his generals last week. In other words, those who advocate intensifying the war economically and in the air and at sea have gained the upper hand. Conversely, those who advocate launching a full-scale offensive on the Western Front have lost out. Therefore, the German Air Force will launch a full-scale offensive against the British coast and fortified cities in the spring of next year. From now until then, a small number of aircraft will be sent to raid England, to greatly stimulate nerves, and to intensify submarine and mine warfare to strike at British and neutral countries' commerce. At the same time, they will intensify threats against neutral countries, forcing them to cease trading with England. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

### German Mine Networks Expand in Danish and Swedish Territorial Waters; Shipping Cut Off in the North Sea and Baltic Sea; England Studies Methods to Defend Against Magnetic Mines

Stockholm – The Naval Department has just issued a bulletin stating that the mine network laid by Germany off the coast of Falster Island, Denmark, has been expanding, especially northward, and that these mines have also been found in Swedish territorial waters. The Swedish government will immediately lodge a protest with the German authorities, because this action has effectively blockaded the Falsterbo Strait between Denmark and Sweden and cut off shipping between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

Stockholm – After Germany expanded its mine network yesterday in the Falsterbo Strait between Sweden and Denmark, especially south of Oresund Bay in Sweden, the Danish Daily News commented on this today, expressing unease, stating that Germany's action clearly failed to respect Swedish territorial waters (four miles from the coast). The two countries originally planned to reopen commercial negotiations in the short term, and it is expected that this action will have a significant impact. This approach is definitely not acceptable to Sweden. Furthermore, Britain's decision to blockade German export trade seriously threatens the shipping industry of neutral countries. To date, 37 Swedish ships have been detained in German ports, 13 of which were transporting wood pulp to Belgium and the Netherlands, and another eight were sailing to England to load coal and return home. The German authorities have detained them for reasons that are mostly untenable. In addition, the British have also detained 15 Swedish ships, but their attitude is not as barbaric as that of the Germans, which is the real situation. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

London – Well-informed sources have just announced that the Admiralty has obtained several German magnetic mines and is immediately examining them in the hope of finding a way to defend against them. It is heard that some discoveries have been made and that results may be achieved soon. According to experts, the way to defend is to install fixed or mobile "magnets" far away to detonate these mines without causing harm. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### More Ship Accidents Continue

London – The British refrigerated ship "Sussex" (2,060 tons) struck a mine in the Thames Estuary today, causing considerable damage. It has been towed into port by a tugboat. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

It is learned that the "Sussex" belongs to the "Peninsular and Oriental Company" and is dedicated to sailing between England and Australia. Its launch ceremony was held in 1937 and is the latest type of meat transport ship. Although the ship was able to reach the Thames safely, the meat it was carrying has been lost. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Amsterdam – According to the "Electrical News", citing London news, the French fishing boat "Claire" sank in the North Sea after accidentally striking a mine. Only one of the twelve crew members was rescued. (Haitong dispatch, 25th)

London – The French fishing boat "Saint Claire" exploded in the English Channel on the 21st of this month and sank as a result. The nine crew members fell into the sea and swam for several hours, but eight of them drowned. Only one person was rescued and has landed in the port of Boulogne, France. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

Stockholm – The Swedish oil tanker "Gustav Routh" (6,300 tons) set sail from Norway the day before yesterday, via the Shetland Islands, bound for Curacao. While sailing near the north coast of England, it was severely damaged after hitting a mine. At 4:00 this morning, the ship sent out a distress signal, claiming that the ship was gradually sinking and that there were still 34 crew members on board. After that, there was no more news. It is believed here that the ship has probably sunk. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

Copenhagen – A German naval patrol ship struck a German mine near Langeland Island today and sank. As it happened, a Danish destroyer and a patrol ship were patrolling in Danish territorial waters and immediately sailed to the rescue. Thirty-three German sailors were rescued, but the whereabouts of several others are unknown. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

London – The British ship "Barrington" collided with a lightship in the English Channel this morning, causing damage to both. (Havas dispatch, 26th)

### Finnish Ship Carrying Goods to England Intercepted by German Warship

Helsinki – The Finnish cargo ship "Britannia" (3,100 tons) was recently intercepted by a German warship in the Baltic Sea near the Swedish coast. The cellulose carried on board was being transported to England. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)

### Dutch Newspaper Bitterly Criticizes German Naval Warfare Methods

The Hague – The Dutch oil tanker "Slite Trelle" was sunk by a German submarine (only five of the 31 crew members were rescued). The Telecommunications News commented on this, stating, "There is no reason for the German submarine to take this action. Even if the submarine commander thought it was necessary, he should have considered humanity and rescued the crew members to preserve their lives. It is correct to let the crew members drift in several lifeboats in the raging wind and waves without offering assistance is extremely barbaric. The Netherlands is a neutral country, and we have no other desire than to maintain neutrality, but this does not mean that we will silently allow other countries to infringe on the lives and property of our people without protesting. In short, the sinking of the 'Slite Trelle' by the German submarine is a shameful act." The People's Daily reported that the country to which the submarine that sank the "Slite Trelle" belonged has been identified. Germany's indiscriminate submarine warfare led to its isolation during the last European war and prompted the United States to enter the war. Will this happen again today?" The Rotterdam City News reported that this type of German naval warfare is inhuman and that all countries will be able to deal with it with effective defensive methods. The British naval power is great and cannot be defeated by this type of German tactic. Considering that the German fleet is still hiding in its own ports, while the British navy is able to control all the oceans, Germany's repeated attacks with submarines, mines, aircraft, and disguised pirate ships have not damaged Britain's naval authority. (Havas dispatch, 25th)

### The Rampant Situation of Poisons in Nanjing: Report by Dr. Bates, Vice President of Jinling University; So This is the So-Called "East Asia New Order"

The Continental News reported that regarding the problem of poisons in Nanjing, Dr. Bates, Vice President of Jinling University, has carefully inquired of many friends and obtained information from officials of the "Reformed Government" and the "Municipal Government," as well as from people in the pseudo-poison distribution agencies, and has prepared a report vehemently opposing the "East Asia New Order." The report stated that there is a population of 480,000 in Nanjing city and the areas adjacent to the city walls, with no fewer than 30 opium retail shops, 175 opium dens, and 14 hotels providing opium for smoking, all of which are licensed. However, there is also a huge amount of private poison trade that has not been authorized, and officials are now continuing to try to control it. This is called "opium suppression." Opium is supplied by the "Opium Suppression Bureau" and sold to public opium retail shops at a price of 19 yuan per ounce, which is then resold by the opium retail shops to the opium dens at a price of about 22 yuan per ounce, but the price is determined by the amount of opium in stock. There is now

Conclusive evidence proves that public opium retail shops sell an average of

Three thousand ounces of opium per day, worth 66,000 yuan. There is also a lot of opium that is not sold by opium retail shops, and opium sold by opium dens, if not purchased from opium retail shops, is often inspected and fined. There are no regulations or accounting for opium sold by opium retail shops, but perhaps 20% to 30% of the opium sold by opium retail shops is not consumed by the 480,000 people in Nanjing. Furthermore, there is privately sold opium in Nanjing, so the actual amount of opium consumed each day is definitely more than 3,000 ounces. Opium smokers need more than one yuan a day to maintain their habit, but the poor consume less than one yuan of opium a day. It is generally believed that the 3,000 ounces of opium sold each day is enough to supply at least 60,000 people, but the total number of opium addicts is far above 60,000. According to various reports, a conclusion can be reached that most of the opium comes from "Manchukuo," followed by Iranian soil, which is purchased and transported by the Japanese. As for those from Annam and the northern border of Jiangsu and Anhui, the number is not large. The "Executive Yuan of the Reformed Government" engages in opium trading in the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, handling about 1 million ounces of opium per month and collecting a "tax" of 3 yuan per ounce, so it can earn

Three million yuan in revenue per month. According to senior officials, the amount of opium sold each month is actually far greater than 1 million ounces. The fact that Nanjing sells 90,000 ounces per month supports this argument, because the number of opium smokers elsewhere is more than 11 times that of Nanjing. The "Opium Suppression Bureau" is expanding its distribution points, and even small towns have opium retail shops. It is heard that a certain city, whose status is far lower than Nanjing, has more than 300 licensed opium dens. The strong support of the "Reformed Government" is actually for the revenue of 3 million yuan. Chinese and Japanese officials alike say that in the current situation, maintaining any government, this type of income is essential. Furthermore, it is heard from political circles that the income of the rulers of this area is not only the opium revenue of 3 yuan per ounce. According to an official, the original price of opium from Dalian is 8 yuan per ounce, plus 2 yuan for transportation, but the wholesale price is 19 yuan per ounce, so the "tax" paid is actually 9 yuan. A certain "Reformed" official frankly stated that the military police and the secret service department both receive a portion of the profits. There is no public organization for heroin trading, so other than the military police and those close to senior management, no one can make statistical reports.

Long-time heroin dealers claim that heroin is transported from Dalian and Tianjin along the Jinpu Railway in large packages, escorted by Japanese ruffians, and fully protected by the army, until it arrives at the distribution points in Nanjing. There are four heroin dealers in Nanjing who are known as the "Heroin Kings." One sales agency employs about 2,400 people, and there are tens of thousands of heroin addicts. The authorities prohibit heroin, and there are many people who are arrested and questioned for smoking or selling it. However, the detention centers are overcrowded, so most of the "prisoners" must be released within five days. According to street rumors, there are two reasons why the authorities arrest heroin offenders: (1) to extort money; (2) to maintain opium sales, so as to avoid the increasingly fierce competition from heroin. Pure heroin sells for about 300 yuan per ounce, while adulterated heroin sells for 130 yuan. Small packets of heroin sell for only two or three cents. Opium addicts need to consume about one yuan of heroin a day to be satisfied, but its results and convenience are better than opium. In total, those who suffer from poisons account for one-fourth or one-third of the total population. The police even claim that the number is even higher. The following matters are visible

The general harm of poisons: (1) A kind-hearted Japanese military officer said that he was surprised to see young men and women who had become addicted to heroin and were imprisoned; (2) A police officer was responsible for investigating 133 households, of which 66 were opium addicts. The police officer found it difficult to order these 66 people to only buy opium from opium retail shops; (3) People in officialdom, regardless of their rank, including the police, are addicted to opium in large numbers; (4) A certain teacher said angrily, "In ten years, there will be no good people in Nanjing"; (5) A certain police officer claimed that 20 to 30 people die of starvation every day due to heroin addiction. Compared with the current situation in Nanjing a year ago, the following changes are worth noting. Opium advertisements are no longer found in newspapers or on the streets, either because of the official's sense of shame or because everyone knows about the opium trade and there is no need to advertise it. However, the signs of opium retail shops and opium dens are still hung in the main roads. The authorities used to pretend to crack down on opium addicts, but now they have abolished it. Anyone can

Buy opium at any time. Although heroin is slightly hidden, it is sold openly in a densely populated area. The number of heroin addicts is appalling. The "government" and some people now rely on the poison business to make a living. Is this the "East Asia New Order"? If so, then the Chinese people now understand its meaning. Otherwise, those responsible should correct it. The author is a Christian and is now writing this report in the great tradition of the anti-drug movement of British and American missionaries. It must be known that opium is a sin, and those who profit from it or protect this sin are shameful.

### Jiangsu Pseudo-Provincial Government Issues Pseudo-Copper Coin Notes, Actually Without Reserve Funds

Suzhou Correspondence: The Suzhou pseudo-provincial government has many redundant staff and huge expenses. The source of funds depends entirely on donations and taxes, and the collection of land taxes from the occupied pseudo-county governments. However, although the collection of land taxes in various counties was started early, the amount collected is still very small, seemingly non-existent. They want to strictly urge and pursue the collection from the countryside, but because the police force is weak, there is nothing they can do. Therefore, the expenses of the pseudo-provincial government are stretched and overwhelmed. Recently, in order to urgently put out the fire, it issued 150,000 yuan of copper coin notes to supplement the funds, under the pretext of facilitating small change in the market, but in reality, it is to absorb cash. The copper coin notes are nominally issued by the pseudo-provincial treasury, but in reality, there are no reserve funds, which shows the extent of the economic exhaustion of the pseudo-provincial government. The notes are divided into four types: one coin, ten coins, fifteen coins, and thirty coins. The paper is thin and the printing is poor. All shops in Suzhou have now been forced to use them, but the people have no confidence in these unreliable copper coins. The reason why they can circulate in the market now is entirely due to force. Shanghai has already issued small change notes twice. The people in the occupied areas urgently hope that the small change notes will be issued more and imported into the occupied areas so that the pseudo-copper coin notes will have no place to stand.

### The Japanese Army's Landing in Southern Guangdong: Ando Issued a Mobilization Order After Returning to Guangzhou; Japanese Naval and Land Forces Arrived in Weizhou Island One After Another; The Japanese Army Attempted to Go Straight to Nanning via Longmen

A dispatch from Hong Kong reports that early this month, Ando, the commander of the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Army, returned to Guangzhou from Shanghai. He then convened a meeting of Japanese generals and puppet organization figures. The first issue was to increase troop deployments to the south and to agree on a route of invasion. The meeting was held under strict security, but it was already known outside that there were plans for a major offensive against Guangxi. The second issue was to discuss the rotation of two Japanese divisions stationed in Guangzhou. As soon as the meeting ended, an order to temporarily block the Humen (Bocca Tigris) strait was issued. In the following ten days, Japanese troops from Taiwan and Chaozhou were continuously transported to Guangdong, entering through Humen. At the same time, more than twenty Japanese transport ships gathered outside the Pearl River estuary, carrying Japanese mechanized units and a certain division stationed in Guangzhou to southern Guangdong. This secret movement lasted for a week. Publicly, it was announced that the Humen strait was being cleared of mines, prohibiting Chinese and foreign ships from entering and exiting. In reality, the Japanese military did not allow Chinese and foreign ships to mix in during the transportation period to prevent any disadvantage. Only after the Guangzhou Japanese army had completed its transport ten days later did the Jinshan, a merchant ship that left Hong Kong for Guangzhou on the 14th, set sail for Guangzhou.

While the majority of the Japanese troops were being transferred to southern Guangdong, a portion temporarily awaited orders on Weizhou Island, while another portion was stationed on ships. From the waters near Weizhou Island to the sea areas of Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Qionghai, and the Leizhou Peninsula Strait, no fewer than thirty or forty Japanese warships were concentrated. The Beihai sea area had long been blockaded. All foreign merchant ships entering were inspected by Japanese warships and prevented from unloading cargo. Therefore, in recent months, ships sailing from Hong Kong to Beihai or from Guangzhou Bay had been unable to deliver goods and had to proceed directly to Haiphong. The British Imperial Airways passenger aircraft, the Daedalus, departed from Hong Kong on the morning of the 8th. While flying over Weizhou Island, it was suddenly attacked by Japanese warships with anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese troops on Weizhou Island also opened fire with machine guns. Five Japanese aircraft then took off, surrounding and attacking the British aircraft, blocking its path. The Imperial Airways aircraft was forced to land on Weizhou Island, and the passengers and pilot were detained. The severity of the Japanese warships' blockade of Beihai at the time was evident.

At the same time, the Leizhou sea area was also being unofficially blockaded. On the 6th and 7th of this month, Japanese warships constantly patrolled the Leizhou Strait, and transport ships shuttled back and forth. Whenever they encountered fishing boats at sea, they would pursue and capture them, killing the fishermen and burning their boats. It is estimated that no fewer than one hundred and several dozen fishing boats have been burned. Hai'an Port in Xuwen County, Leizhou Prefecture, was also blockaded by Japanese warships, and civilian and fishing boats in the port had been unable to exit for half a month. The Qinzhou and Lianzhou sea area was the intended destination for the Japanese army's passage. Therefore, for several months, technicians had been surveying the water depth along the coast of Guantou Ridge and the Qisha sea area of Fangcheng, and placing buoys to facilitate the docking of Japanese warships.

The Chinese military authorities in Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Gaozhou, Leizhou, and Yangjiang anticipated that the Japanese army would sooner or later attempt to achieve its goals in the southern route. For months, they had made thorough arrangements for coastal defense, such as arming and training the populace, organizing joint defense among teams, implementing a scorched-earth policy and evacuating empty houses along the coast, dispersing the population, moving supplies, demolishing pillboxes, destroying highways, establishing more guard posts, and establishing a dense transportation network, sparing no effort. They were especially strict in inspecting traitors. The coastline was divided into defense zones, and all rice paddies were harvested early, with the defending army harvesting on behalf of the farmers. The fields were then plowed, turned over, and filled with water to prevent the enemy's mechanized units from penetrating deeply.

In the past week, the Japanese army's invading troops have gradually gathered on Weizhou Island and on ships in the sea area. On the 8th of this month, the Japanese warships gathered in the Qinzhou and Lianzhou sea area numbered sixteen or seventeen, including over twenty transport ships, and two small aircraft carriers, the "Kaga" and "Peng Bird," each with over twenty seaplanes. Additionally, there were about forty Japanese aircraft at the Japanese airfield on Weizhou Island. For the past two months, Japanese aircraft have continuously bombed Guangxi Province over Qinzhou and Lianzhou. In the past two weeks, there has not been a day without such acts of cruelty. By the 14th of this month, the Japanese army in southern Guangdong was ready to go. At around 5:00 AM on the 15th, transport ships carrying one to two thousand soldiers invaded the northwest coast of Beihai. Several Japanese gunboats bombarded the area. The defending army initially calmly fought back. However, when the Japanese army sent over ten aircraft to bomb at low altitude, half of the defending army's positions were destroyed. Moreover, the Japanese army's momentum was fierce, using the strength of a lion to seize a rabbit, swarming in. With a disparity in numbers, the defending army was forced to temporarily shift its position. Five hundred Japanese soldiers then forcibly landed successively at 9:00 AM that morning, advancing on Beihai City in two routes. Beihai had previously evacuated its supplies and population, resembling a dead city. The Japanese army intended to enter Guangxi Province via Beihai to reach Nanning. However, large armies from both Guangdong and Guangxi were concentrated northeast of Beihai, and it would not be easy for the Japanese army to lightly advance into Guangxi. Currently, the defending army in Qinzhou and Lianzhou has selected positions to engage in battle with the Japanese army. Residents of Qinzhou and Lianzhou have been relocating inland or fleeing to French Haiphong, Annam, and Guangzhou Bay to avoid the conflict, with the majority fleeing to Haiphong. French military police in Haiphong have now established strict defenses to prevent. After the Japanese army occupied the northwest coast of Beihai, they searched for an airfield to facilitate the Japanese aircraft's However, many villagers had scattered, and the Japanese army felt it was extremely difficult to build defensive fortifications. (Evening of November 15th)

### Yellow Disaster Refugee Relief Measures: 100,000 to Be Transported to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia; 200,000 to Be Distributed in Western Henan

A dispatch from Chengdu reports that due to the Yellow River flood disaster, 3 million refugees from eastern and northern Henan have crossed the new channel of the Yellow River, seeking a livelihood to the west. The situation for 300,000 people who urgently need relief is the most dire. Without clothing or food, it is difficult to survive. As early winter approaches and the weather becomes increasingly cold, relief work is urgently needed. Zhu Qinglan, a standing committee member of the Central Relief Committee, is currently in Shaanxi, consulting with the Henan and Shaanxi provincial governments to establish a joint relief association to seek relief. Of the 300,000 disaster victims urgently in need of relief, 200,000 will be distributed to western Henan to engage in production work, which is currently being actively transported and arranged by the Henan provincial government. It is expected to be completed by early winter. The remaining 100,000 will be transported to Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and other provinces to engage in reclamation. The Sichuan province is allocating 15,000 refugees, who have successively arrived in Hanzhong. The Sichuan Provincial Relief Association and the Chengdu General Station of the Central Relief Committee are rushing to formulate plans to allocate them to Guangyuan and Jiange in northern Sichuan. The elderly and weak will receive relief, while the young and strong will engage in land reclamation and small-scale industrial production. All measures have now been generally finalized.

### Chinese Army in Haizhou Recaptures Wangzhuang and Xinba, Killing Over 100 Japanese and Puppet Troops

A dispatch from Haizhou reports that since the arrival of Zhang Yi's troops from the First Route Army in Haizhou, there have been repeated battles in the past half-month. On the 15th of this month, Zhang's troops attacked Wuzhuang Town, near Haizhou. The town was originally garrisoned by a joint Japanese and puppet force of about 500 people, who hastily responded. After a day-long battle, it was estimated that 32 Japanese soldiers and over 80 puppet soldiers were killed, 15 Japanese soldiers were captured, and over 50 rifles, many Japanese flags, and a large amount of ammunition and military supplies were seized. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army in Banpu urgently dispatched the Mikawa Infantry Regiment and the Kuwagawa Cavalry Regiment, repeatedly reinforcing from Xinba and Pingming Street, but were ultimately intercepted halfway by Zhang, who personally led his troops. On the 16th, the Japanese army finally gave way and On the 17th, he then recaptured Xinba. The Japanese army in Haizhou is now extremely fearful.

### Japan Spares No Effort, Deploying All Garrison Troops in Shanghai to the Front Lines; Only a Small Number of Marines Maintain Defense; Security in Hongkou Becomes More Stringent Again

In order to continue the Xianggui battles, the Japanese army has transferred eleven divisions to reinforce those two areas. The Japanese army in Songhu has been almost entirely depleted, with puppet police taking over sentry posts and a very small number of naval marines maintaining the surface. The details are as follows:

Increasing Reinforcements to Reverse the Decline

Since the Japanese government appointed Nishio and Itagaki as the commander-in-chief and chief of staff of the China Expeditionary Army, respectively, their first battle was the disastrous defeat at Changsha, northern Hunan. The two major officials, known for being talented members of the younger generation of Japan, were humiliated by this. Therefore, to make a final struggle and reverse the declining trend, they specially transferred newly dispatched Japanese troops, Kwantung Army troops, and troops recuperating in the rear in northern and central China to form eleven divisions. Six divisions were sent to the front lines in northern Hunan, upstream of the Yangtze River, to reinforce, and five divisions were sent to Guangxi to reinforce and attack Nanning, attempting a desperate gamble. It is heard that a fierce war is about to break out in northern Hunan. A certain commander-in-chief of the Chinese side has made full preparations to inflict a serious blow on the stubborn enemy upon their invasion.

Defense is Weak; Puppet Police Take Over

In order to support the Xianggui battles, the Japanese side not only transferred all of the resting troops in the rear in various parts of China to reinforce, but also transferred all of the Japanese army retreating from the front and gathering in Wusong, Baoshan, Jiangwan, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the South City. However, in order to maintain appearances, they specially transferred the only special naval marine corps from the ships docked in the Huangpu River, allocating a very small number to land and garrison the Central Mint, the Bank of Communications warehouse, the Hongkou Headquarters, the Wusong Paotaiwan, and the Shizilin, among other places. The sentry posts along the roads in the aforementioned areas and along the Suzhou Creek were manned by a small number of Japanese troops, and the rest have been taken over by puppet police. This shows that they have exhausted their tricks and are growing more anxious.

Stringent Security; Searching Pedestrians

Since the incident on the 19th of this month when a Japanese man named Asahina was robbed on Tangshan Road, the strict security measures in the Hongkou Yangshupu area have not been relaxed to this day. In addition to conducting strict checks on Chinese people entering and exiting the bridges and gaps leading into the special zone, they have also deployed naval marines and consular police to patrol the main roads every evening, implementing security measures. They search the entire bodies of Chinese people and inquire in detail about their age, origin, and address. If the Japanese army believes that the answers do not match their permits, or if the photos on the permits do not match their appearance, they are immediately arrested.

Searching House by House; Harassing in Every Way

According to people from Hongkou, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 25th), six or seven members of the Japanese military police suddenly conducted house-by-house searches in the alleyways of Songpan Road and Yangshupu Road, but the result was nothing. Passengers in "Central China Company cars" only needed to show their permits in the car to pass normally when driving to Japanese military posts. However, recently, all Chinese passengers must get out of the car and wait for inspection before being allowed to board. On the 5th of this month, the Japanese military posts at ten key intersections that had been withdrawn have now been restored to their original state every evening. Moreover, there are several places where no sentries had been stationed before that have now been added, and inspections are being conducted on Chinese pedestrians.

Military Telephones Installed in Hongkou

Furthermore, after the Japanese army installed military telephones on Bazhi Road, north of Suzhou Road (between the Baibo Bridge and the Sichuan Road Bridge), five Japanese soldiers installed military telephones in the Taopeng Road Yangshupu Road area yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. From this, we can see the panic of the Japanese army and their intensification of security.

### The Puppet Police in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area Intensify Their Encroachment on Police Power; Posts Extend to Columbia Road Intersection; Gangsters Run Rampant in the Wujiaochang Area

The actions of the Japanese puppets in Shanghai to encroach on police power in the extra-settlement roads area have recently intensified. The puppet "Shanghai West Police Branch" has not only expanded its existing organization and moved to 11 Extreme Road, but has also successively established puppet police substations in important sections of Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Haig Road, attempting to realize the illusion of controlling all the extra-settlement roads. The puppet police posted on Anhe Temple Road have extended from the Victory Road area to the Columbia Road intersection. Currently, the patrol room has patrol teams and two armored vehicles patrolling back and forth all day long, making the situation suddenly tense. In the Caojiadu and Wujiaochang areas, opium dens and casinos are densely located, and "gangsters" gather, being the source of all evils. After 12:00 AM every night, the puppet police and patrolmen are all withdrawn, shops close early, and there are very few pedestrians on the road. Therefore, the gangsters take the opportunity to move out in all directions, openly prying open the doors of residents and robbing property. If the victims report to the patrol room for arrest, they will inevitably be arrested by the puppet police, severely interrogated, and falsely accused, causing those who have been poisoned to remain silent. And those gangsters have become even more unscrupulous.

### There Are Rumors in the Market; Rice Prices Are Difficult to Stabilize

The entire Shanghai food situation once tended to stabilize, and rice prices plummeted to around 26 yuan. In recent days, due to rampant rice weevils, baseless rumors have spread in the market, causing anxiety among the people and rice prices to rebound again. However, the rice industry associations in this city have been standing by idly, which is also their responsibility. It is deeply hoped that the authorities will conduct a thorough investigation impartially. Yesterday, 20,658 bags of tribute rice arrived by wheel, and the source of national rice continues to flow. It is estimated that over 6,000 bags arrived by wheeled transport yesterday.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Voyage Shortened; May Be Realized; Six Ships Designated for Passengers Only, Unloading Passengers Only

There are currently thirteen foreign ships sailing the Shanghai-Ningbo route, but the voyage is extremely slow because they have to wait outside Zhenhai Port to unload cargo. Each trip takes more than a month. Although two anchorages have been added outside Zhenhai Port, allowing four ships to unload cargo simultaneously, the shortage of barges and the seasonal winds outside the port hinder barge transport, so the voyage has still not been shortened as much as possible.

Travelers still feel deeply inconvenienced. After discussions among shipping companies, a request was submitted to the Ningbo Defense Headquarters to find a way to adjust the situation. The headquarters approved the request and designated six ships for passengers only: Mufuk, Deping, Bao, Hana, Haifu, and Feikang. The goal is to shorten the voyage and facilitate travel. It is stipulated that the above six ships will load passengers in Shanghai and proceed to Zhenhai. After arriving in Zhenhai, they will unload passengers in order and return to the original port without unloading the cargo, then load passengers again and sail to Ningbo. This will free up time to wait for unloading, allowing for multiple passenger trips.

It is also stipulated that each ship will run on a three-day schedule. According to the shipping industry, if there are no other obstacles, this plan is expected to be implemented starting from the 1st of next month. After that, one ship from Shanghai will sail to Zhenhai every three days, thus greatly shortening the voyage and making travel more convenient.

### Conserve Diesel Fuel During Wartime to Meet the Needs of Long-Term War

The Ministry of Economic Affairs considers diesel fuel essential for wartime industrial machinery and transportation, and, like gasoline, an important fuel for wartime. In addition to making every effort to research, improve, and increase production, it has recently issued a general order to the governments of all provinces, cities, and counties to instruct public and private institutions and the public to conserve diesel fuel as much as possible to meet the needs of long-term war.

### Japan Attempts to Control China's Entire Shipping Industry; Planned Conspiracies Are Implemented Successively; The Rights of Third Countries Are Completely Disregarded

The Mainland Daily reports that as of yesterday (the 25th), although third countries have protested to Japan against the continued blockade of the Yangtze River and the prohibition of foreign ships from sailing, Tokyo has not yet responded, or has refused to do so under the pretext of "military necessity." However, Japanese shipping companies are preparing long-term expansion plans to ultimately gain complete control of China's coastal and waterway trade. Japanese officials expect to achieve their expansion plans in about three years, gradually eliminating foreign shipping from all areas of the trade routes. The Japanese "East Asia Shipping Company" has ordered no fewer than 72 ships, totaling over 25,000 tons. From this, we can see the scope of the Japanese attempt to gain a complete monopoly. Among the ships that the company has already ordered or is currently building, there are three large cargo-passenger ships dedicated to the Yangtze River. One is named Dongmaru (transliteration), weighing 3,500 tons, which was completed last month. There are also two recently launched ships, the 4,020-ton Myokomaru and the 2,577-ton Shinshinmaru (both transliterations). At the same time, although Japan has repeatedly claimed that Japanese ships carrying goods to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are engaged in army and navy work, according to the monthly report of the Shanghai Inland Water Transport Company, the company transported no less than 1,461 tons of goods to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in October. The amount of goods transported on smaller rivers is also considerable. According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, the business of the Shanghai Inland Water Transport Company in October decreased slightly compared to September. In October, the company transported 30,167 tons of goods from Shanghai and 29,694 tons of goods to Shanghai, for a total of 59,861 tons. In the same month, 23,906 tons of goods were transported along the Suzhou River, 7,998.5 tons were transported along the Huangpu River, and 1,461 tons were transported along the Yangtze River. Compared with September, the cargo volume in October fell by 1,773 tons, while passenger volume increased by 2,289 people.

The total number of passengers carried was 125,707. Currently, the East Asia Shipping Company of Japan operates a total of 160,000 tons of ships, crowding out third-country ships in central China. According to a Japanese announcement yesterday, when the first year of the three-year plan begins in the spring of next year, the Japanese company will add ten new ships, each with a carrying capacity of 4,000 tons. When the second year of the plan is implemented in 1941, Japan will completely control shipping in North China. When the third year of the plan is implemented in 1942, Japan will control shipping in South China. The construction of the Yawan will be completed on December 10. By March of next year, there will be six other ships with the same tonnage as the Xingyawan completed successively. In addition, several ships, such as the Ningbowa, will also be completed next year.

### The Luen Chang Factory Plans to Resume Work Early; The Weather Is Cold; The Demand for Goods Is Urgent

After the labor dispute at the British-owned Luen Chang Textile Factory in Puxi was resolved, it was originally scheduled to officially resume work on December 1. It is now learned that the factory has completed the repair of its machinery, and the weather has entered deep winter, and there is an urgent demand for various Luen Chang products on the market. Therefore, all workers have been notified to return to the factory early today to resume work.

### To Prevent Profiteering from Melting, Increase the Exchange Rate of Copper Coins; 200 Coins Exchanged for One Legal Tender Yuan; Strictly Prohibit Smuggling, Hoarding, and Speculation; The Ministry of Finance Issues an Order to All Provinces and Cities to Comply

The Ministry of Finance has long issued an order to investigate and arrest those who smuggle copper coins out and allow the Central Bank and local banks to issue fractional currency notes for circulation. Since the outbreak of the European War, copper prices have soared. To prevent profiteering from melting, the exchange rate of 10-cash copper coins has been increased, and smuggling, private destruction, hoarding, and speculation have been strictly prohibited. The details are as follows:

Prohibit Smuggling, Hoarding, and Speculation

(1) The Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to various provinces, stating that the copper coins circulating in the market are closely related to the people's daily needs and should be maintained at a certain quantity to regulate supply and demand and stabilize life. The smuggling and private destruction of copper coins have long been strictly prohibited by the Ministry, and orders have been issued to effectively stop them. Recently, due to the outbreak of the European War, copper prices have gradually risen, and unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to collect and melt them for profit. During this period of resistance, stabilizing the people's livelihood is the most important current policy. In addition to separate telegrams, we specially request that you relay this to your subordinates and strictly prohibit the smuggling and private destruction of copper coins, and crack down on hoarding and speculation. Once discovered, they should be severely punished according to the law to warn against wrongdoing and maintain the currency policy.

Newly Defined Exchange Rate for 10-Cash Copper Coins

(2) The Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to various provincial governments, stating that the 10-cash copper coins circulating in the market are closely related to the people's daily needs. In order to unify the exchange rate and prevent manipulation, the Ministry stipulated when implementing the legal tender in 1914 that one legal tender yuan would be exchanged for 300 10-cash copper coins and issued orders to comply. Recently, due to the outbreak of the European War, copper prices have gradually risen, and unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to collect and melt them for profit. It is urgent to redefine the exchange rate to prevent this. After careful consideration of the situation, it has been newly stipulated that the exchange rate of 10-cash copper coins will be 200 10-cash copper coins for one legal tender yuan. In provinces and regions where 10-cash copper coins are circulated, the exchange rate must be unified and must not be arbitrarily increased or decreased in order to prevent private destruction and facilitate the people's use. In addition to separate telegrams, we specially request that you relay this to your subordinates for unified knowledge.

### Various Countries' Shipping to China: Japan First, Britain Conversely Decreases; German Ships Disappear After the Outbreak of the European War

The customs announced the shipping figures for various countries to China from January to October this year: Japan, 6,560 ships, 9,829,654 tons; Britain, 2,508 ships, 7,519,788 tons; the United States, 102 ships, 631,728 tons; Chinese ships (excluding civilian ships), 995 ships, 580,788 tons; civilian ships, 89,898 ships, 1,308,406 tons; Denmark, 185 ships, 588,154 tons; France, 112 ships, 687,55 tons; Germany, 239 ships, 1,86,819 tons; Greece, 35 ships, 104,439 tons; Italy, 84 ships, 494,657 tons; the Netherlands, 193 ships, 877,681 tons; Norway, 637 ships, 1,407,951 tons; Panama, 44 ships, 85,982 tons; Portugal, 53 ships, 181,804 tons; other countries, 366 ships, 200,355 tons; for a total of 102,468 ships, 25,739,547 tons. After the outbreak of the European War in October, German merchant ships completely disappeared from import and export. The total was 12,419 ships, 2,036,637 tons, with Japan being the most numerous, with 769 ships, 981,995 tons, followed by Britain, with 159 ships, 507,713 tons, and then Norway, with 32 ships, 82,293 tons.

### Salesian Society's Winter Clothing for Refugee Children; 2,000 Sets Made First; Target of 10,000 Sets; Donations Hoped for Quickly

The Chinese Salesian Society, recognizing that tens of thousands of refugee children in this city lack winter clothing to keep warm, is conducting a fundraising campaign for refugee children's winter clothing, with a target of 10,000 sets. Since the fundraising began, there has been enthusiastic donations from all sectors, which has been very active. It is reported that the Society has made 100,000 badges for Salesian children, and all those who donate more than 20 cents will be given a badge to commemorate their donation. Letters have been sent to various schools in this city to assist in promoting the campaign. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council Education Department has expressed its support for the fundraising campaign for refugee children's winter clothing. Schools such as Great China University, Shanghai Middle School, China Middle School, and Guangxia Middle School are all assisting in promoting the campaign. In addition, the Society has decided to make 2,000 sets of winter clothing first to meet the urgent needs of refugee children due to the continuous cold and piercing winds.

### Amassing Clothing for Refugees; Variety Show Opens

The Citizens' Group Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, noting that the weather is cold and that 50,000 refugees remaining in Shanghai lack clothing to keep warm, has specially requested famous performers, actors, movie stars, Yue opera, drama, comedy, storytelling, Shanghai opera, and Kunqu opera masters from the city to hold a variety show at the Renewal Stage to raise funds for refugee clothing. It is reported that the variety show is scheduled to officially open today with the following schedule: 27th: Afternoon: Comedy, storytelling, and Kunqu opera; Evening: Famous actors. 28th: Afternoon: Shanghai opera; Evening: Amateur performers. 29th: Afternoon: Drama; Evening: Movie stars. 30th: Afternoon: Famous actors; Evening: Amateur performers. December 1st: Afternoon and Evening: Yue opera. The Society recently notified all ticket holders: (1) Starting today, tickets can be exchanged for numbered seats at the Renewal Stage; (2) Payments for tickets must be receipted; please do not pay without a receipt; (3) Purchases and donations should be made directly to the Society's temporary office at the Renewal Stage or the Society at Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road (telephone 18533).

### The French Second Battalion Stationed in Shanghai Ordered to Depart for Vietnam; Soldiers Rejoice, Preparing to Return to Battle; Some Say the Battalion Must Still Return to Shanghai for Garrison Duty

According to the Continental Daily News, the French colonial infantry's second battalion, approximately 800 men, including 60 recently conscripted French citizens of Shanghai, abruptly bid farewell to Shanghai yesterday (the 25th). Shortly after noon yesterday, seven public buses and more than a dozen military trucks carrying the battalion's soldiers, their families, military equipment, etc., passed along Avenue Edward VII and the Bund, crossed the Garden Bridge, and arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf. They boarded the French Postal Company's "Antrilaipeng" (transliteration) ship (8,000 tons). Many of their friends went to the wharf to see them off in the cold wind. The "Antrilaipeng" will sail to Saigon, stopping only in Hong Kong en route. It was originally scheduled to weigh anchor at 6:00 AM this morning (the 26th), but it is expected that the departure time will be changed due to threats from spies on their departure time from Shanghai. It is said that the second battalion will be stationed in Vietnam, presumably to replace the French forces being transferred to the European battlefield. It is also known that the soldiers of the second battalion were last granted leave on the evening of Friday the 5th of last week, and they were quite joyful upon hearing the news of their departure, firmly believing that they would not be stationed in Vietnam for long and would soon be transferred back to France. However, well-informed sources in this city believe that the battalion will soon return to this city for garrison duty. Many of the soldiers are married and are taking their wives and children with them.

### Returned Overseas Chinese Talk: France Restricts Taking Silver Out of the Country; Each Person is Only Allowed to Carry 500 Francs; Returned Overseas Chinese Remnant Funds Handed Over to the French Customs

According to returned overseas Chinese who had resided in France, since France implemented military action against Germany, wartime measures have been implemented for everything in the country. In order to prevent capital outflow, the French government has stipulated that each foreigner is limited to 500 francs when carrying national currency out of the country. That is, when carrying British pounds, US dollars, or other national currencies, it must also be converted according to the value of the franc. If the total amount exceeds 500 francs, the excess amount will be confiscated in full. Therefore, the overseas Chinese who returned to the country from France this time did not carry the excess funds that exceeded the limit for export. Some overseas Chinese, fearing that it would be difficult to return to France in a short period of time after returning to the country, collectively handed over the amount exceeding the limit to the French customs, who issued a receipt so that they could wait for remittance after returning to the country. They are currently in Shanghai waiting to receive it.

### British Royal Engineers Association Recruiting Volunteer Engineers to Return Home; Tense Front Lines in France and Germany; France Needs Talent Urgently; Experienced Personnel Must Be Replaced to Serve on the French Front Lines

As the military situation on the French-German front lines gradually became tense, the French side urgently needed engineering talent. The British Royal Engineers Association in this port held a general meeting of members at the Royal Aeronautical Society on the Bund the night before last, recruiting volunteer engineers to return home to work, replacing experienced engineers currently serving in this country, so that they can serve on the French front lines. Captain Marsa, president of the association, presided over the meeting, with Herkley as vice president, stating the above intentions. After discussing and deciding on registration, distribution, transportation, fundraising and other matters, the meeting adjourned.

### The Rumor of Dime Coins Flowing into the Occupied Areas; All are Excuses of Hoarders; Storing in Batches is a Fact; But the Panic Can Be Resolved Soon

The panic of the lack of dime coins in the market seems to be愈演愈烈 (becoming more and more intense). According to a Datong News Agency reporter's observation in the market yesterday, the smoke and exchange industry had to post several points of premium for exchanging national currency for dime coins. Stores need to give change of more than three or four dimes when buying goods, and some businesses have actually given up operating because they cannot give dime coins. According to general discussions, the reasons for the shortage of dime coins have become complicated. It is said that many people are storing them in batches, waiting for them to become rare goods. Some say that flowing into the occupied areas is completely an excuse. Therefore, those who tie the bell must untie it. General hoarders and colleagues in the smoke and exchange industry should bear considerable responsibility and should come out and use them urgently. As for the fifty-cent subsidiary coins, the China Farmers Bank has already supplied them for exchange, and one-cent and two-cent banknotes will soon be transported from Hong Kong to Shanghai by the Central Bank for relief. Therefore, the above panic is believed to be resolved soon.

### Measures for Requisitioning and Appointing Wartime Sanitary Personnel; Those who Evade will be Punished According to Military Law; Those who Enlist will be Treated Favorably

The Ministry of Military Administration, in order to requisition wartime sanitary personnel to take on the work of delivering medicines and providing medical care, has specially drafted measures and issued them to the health authorities of various provinces, cities, and counties to handle the requisition matters. Those who graduated from military medical schools and military medical training classes, currently hold external positions, or have been practicing for less than 58 years should be transferred first. Licensed physicians, pharmacists, medical agents, nurses, etc., should be preferentially transferred by the provincial government within the percentage designated by the Central Government. Except for those who are certified to be delayed due to illness, those who fail to handle matters properly, or engage in favoritism and malpractice, and those who are requisitioned and evade or refuse on the grounds of excuses, will be punished separately in accordance with the Regulations on Punishment of Military Service in the Army and the Regulations on Punishment of Crimes against Military Service. Regarding the duties of those who are enlisted, the provincial, municipal, and county governments will notify their service units to retain their positions and suspend their salaries until the time of demobilization. The reporting location for those who are enlisted is the military medical offices in various provinces designated by the Central Military Medical Department. In order to facilitate the actions of those who are enlisted, the provincial and municipal governments order them to concentrate in one place and then depart. Travel expenses are issued by the county and municipal governments. After arriving at the office, the waiting period is called military medical reserve personnel, learning military etiquette and sanitation duties. As for the work treatment, it is as follows: A. Graduates of medical schools approved by domestic and foreign governments will be assigned to work with the following treatment: (1) Those who have not held medical positions will be treated as first-class assistants; (2) Those who have held medical positions for more than three years will be treated as third-class officers; (3) Those who have held medical positions for more than five years will be treated as second-class officers; (4) Those whose academic skills are indeed excellent will be treated according to the Provisional Rules for Specialist Military Physicians. B. Graduates of medical schools not approved by the Ministry of Education and non-formal medical schools will be assigned to work with the following treatment by analogy: (1) Those who have not held medical positions will be treated by analogy to second-class assistants or third-class assistants; (2) Those who have held medical positions for more than two years will be treated by analogy to second-class assistants; (3) Those who have held medical positions for more than three years will be treated by analogy to first-class assistants; (4) Those who have held medical positions for more than five years or whose academic skills are indeed excellent will be treated by analogy to third-class officers.

### The Postal Bureau Temporarily Suspends Telegraphic Remittances to Guangdong

Since the Shanghai Postal Administration resumed telegraphic remittances to various places in November of last year, it has been quite convenient to send money back and forth. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, regarding telegraphic remittances to Guangdong, due to the obstruction of transportation between Shanghai and Guangdong, postal and telecommunications exchanges are not without difficulties. From now on, telegraphic remittances from Shanghai to Guangdong or from Guangdong to Shanghai will be temporarily suspended. It is reported that telegraphic remittances are currently not available to the following provinces and cities: Beiping, Hankou, Xiamen, Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Kaifeng Jiangxi. The usual remittance fee is 1.25 yuan and a handling fee of 10 cents for no more than 20 characters, and 12.5 cents will be added for each additional character. A brief message from the remitter will cost 25 cents per character.

### A Staff Member of the Maintenance Society Arrested

Zhu Heshang, a local staff member of the Hongqiao Town Maintenance Society in western Shanghai, was arrested by guerrillas at Xinjingkou, the western end of the town, on the afternoon of the 20th of this month while collecting donations from boatmen. His life or death is still unknown. One rumor says that he was detained by Japanese soldiers, but this has not been confirmed.

### Japanese Troops Landed in Beihai; The Purpose is to Cut off the Longyong Road

— Min

Written by John Ahlers, translated from the Miller's Review

(Continued) The Japanese troops set out from Tokyo Bay, aiming for the Longyong Road, hoping to cut off this vital transportation artery for "Free China," and took this action in a timely manner to prevent the direct transportation of railways passing through Guangxi Province between Haiphong and Hengyang from being realized. The location where the French railway enters Yunnan is more than 300 miles from the coast, far beyond the reach of the Japanese troops landing in Tokyo Bay, but once the Japanese troops tried to invade the mountainous area between Guangdong and Guangxi and descend into the Youjiang River basin, then the Longyong Road, only 100 miles from the coast, would be difficult to defend effectively. Yongning itself is only 70 miles directly from Qinzhou, which was occupied by the Japanese army.

From the perspective of the entire economy of "Free China," the Beihai-Qinzhou area and the Longzhou-Yongning area are insignificant in other aspects except for the direct transportation of the latter. This transportation is only a small part related to the economy of Guangxi. The military equipment imported through Longzhou is distributed to the Guangxi Army and the Central Army, but almost all other goods imported through Longzhou pass through Liuzhou, Guilin, and Guiyang into Sichuan. Guangxi is a fundamentally poor province with very limited economic resources and possibilities. Although agriculture and animal husbandry occupy an important position, the forms and methods are still clumsy. Wuzhou and Yongning on the West River have unimportant agricultural and manufacturing industries, which are still small in scale, and not much tungsten ore is mined. Guangxi's trade and banking industries are old-fashioned and very inflexible. General Li Zongren and General Bai Chongxi prohibited the accumulation of significant amounts of funds in Guangxi Province. Guangxi currency can often be obtained in large quantities for military use; and almost no funds are used for any new commercial investment.

The lack of funds in Guangxi has made the central government's efforts to gradually break down the province's isolation and autonomy proceed smoothly. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the central government immediately began to economically penetrate Guangxi by means of credit loans and other financial assistance. The Central Government's Bank of China and the Bank of Communications subscribed for 17 million yuan of Guangxi government bonds, and the income was used as the reserve for Guangxi banknotes. The circulation of legal tender gradually spread throughout Guangxi, and people have gradually accepted the official price of one yuan of legal tender for two yuan of Guangxi currency. Government banks also assisted in the issuance of two other batches of Guangxi government bonds, each worth 15 million yuan, and established branch banks in larger cities in Guangxi. As for the construction of new railways in Guangxi, the province only provides unskilled labor. Other expenses, such as railway tracks, trains, and engineers, are provided by the central government. The central government also funded the construction of the Longyong Road and the highway from Wuzhou to Xindu (transliteration). The Central Agricultural Affairs Bureau lent 5 million yuan of rural loans to Guangxi farmers, and this year allocated 2 million yuan for the West River area irrigation plan. Among the industrial projects recently implemented by the central government in Guangxi, the most outstanding is the construction of a modern large sugar refinery in an undisclosed location.

However, Guangxi is still an economically backward province, and its contact with the new economic development of "Free China" is far less than that of Sichuan and other provinces. Guangxi has a strong military force, and there will be fierce battles if the Japanese army invades, but since Guangxi is relatively poor, the hope of the Japanese army obtaining any important spoils of war is also small. Under these circumstances, if the Japanese army can achieve the purpose of seizing or blocking the Longyong Highway, it will probably be satisfied. (End)

### The North Wind Howls, the Weather is Extremely Cold; Beggars Freeze to Death in the Streets; More Than 50 Bodies Were Found Yesterday; The Lowest Temperature Was Only 28 Degrees

Since the day before yesterday, the north wind has been howling in this city, the temperature has suddenly dropped, and it has become even colder day by day. Accumulated water has frozen into solid ice, which is the only thing seen since the beginning of winter this year, resulting in as many as fifty or sixty homeless people and beggars freezing to death on the roadside, a situation that is extremely tragic. The details are recorded separately below.

North Wind Howls, Temperature Drops Suddenly

Since the morning of the day before yesterday, after the weather cleared up in this port, the northwest wind suddenly rose, and the temperature dropped suddenly. By yesterday, the north wind was still strong, and the weather was chilling, becoming even colder. The indoor temperature was only 40 degrees, and the outdoor temperature was only a little less than 30 degrees. Therefore, the accumulated water on the roadside actually froze into solid ice, which is really the only thing seen since the beginning of winter this year. Recently, due to the cold air currents from Siberia pushing towards northern China, the temperature in various places in North China, such as Pingjin, has fallen to freezing point. Affected by the howling northwest wind in this port, the temperature has also suddenly decreased. Within 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was only 38.5 degrees, and the lowest was 28 degrees.

A Large Number of Beggars Freeze to Death in the Streets

As a result, beggars who are homeless on the streets are starving and freezing in the severe cold, and most of them are frozen stiff. Yesterday morning, police officers from the French Concession found the corpses of these people frozen to death near Medilan Road, Zhengjia Muqiao, Pingjili Road, and Avenue Joffre. After counting them, there were as many as fourteen. Afterwards, they were all transported by car to the Tongren Fuyuantang in Ningbo Road for burial. At the same time, in the Public Concession, beggars were also found frozen to death on the side of the road in Zhejiang Road, Daxin Street, etc. It is said that the Pushan Villa collected more than 30 frozen-to-death bums and beggars in one day yesterday. However, the weather was even colder yesterday, and some unfortunate beggars struggling on the starvation line may still become frozen corpses.

### A Poor Woman Died Tragically While Sweeping up Rice Grains

Liu Ni, a woman from Yangzhou (36 years old), recently came to Shanghai from her hometown to take refuge. She and her husband, Liu Rongsheng, temporarily lived in a thatched cottage built by poor people in Keneng Road. Every day, she went to the Santai Wharf on North Suzhou Road to sweep up rice, beans, wheat, etc., to bring back for cooking. On the 12th of this month, while competing to sweep up rice at the wharf, she was pushed to the ground by her companion, Li Liang, a 44-year-old woman from Anhui who lived next door, and suffered serious injuries. Later, her husband, Liu Rongsheng, transported her by car to the First Refugee Hospital on North Xizang Road for treatment, but she died at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. The corpse was transported to the Corpse Examination Office on Jiaozhou Road. At the same time, her husband, Liu Rongsheng, reported the situation to the Huisi Police Station, who sent detectives to the thatched cottage on Keneng Road and arrested Li Liang, bringing her to the police station and escorting her to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Station Lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and requested detention. Liu Rongsheng, the husband of the deceased, testified about the process and questioned Li Liang. Li Liang's confession was evasive, denying that she had pushed Liu Ni to the ground that day, and asked for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered her to be returned to custody, pending further verification of Liu Ni's corpse.

### The Number of Criminal Cases in the Concession Has Increased Sharply; Prisons are Overcrowded; An Increase of 4,000 People Compared to Before the War; Judicial Authorities are Implementing Parole

Since the outbreak of the war, people from the interior have flocked to Shanghai to take refuge. The population of this city has suddenly increased sharply, and due to the large number of unemployed people, the quality of society is uneven. Therefore, the number of criminal records has also increased day by day. Before the war, there were 4,000 criminals in the British Concession Prison and about 1,000 in the French Concession Prison, but after the war, the number of prisoners in the prisons in both districts increased sharply, and there was a great concern about overcrowding. In order to adapt to the environment, the judicial authorities have separately implemented amnesty, parole, and bail. Those who have served two-thirds of their sentence, have good conduct, and are first-time offenders are given an opportunity to reflect. Since the implementation of this measure, two or three thousand people have been released. However, the number of detainees still reaches 7,000 in the British Concession and 2,000 in the French Concession. The detention centers of the police station, which originally held four people in each room, have also increased to more than ten people. Therefore, the prison authorities of both prisons still hold several parole sessions every month, and invite personnel from the Salvation Army to give speeches at the time of release, in order to reform and start a new life, and strive to learn well. If they still stubbornly refuse to repent, then it is decided that after being arrested, the unfulfilled sentence must still be carried out as usual.

### A Rice Shop Owner Refused to Recognize His Own Daughter; He Filed an Appeal After Losing the Lawsuit

Zhang Huiming, the 42-year-old owner of Dongcheng Rice Shop at 120 Ganshi East Road in the French Concession, from Baoshan, met Chen Qinbao, a woman from Suzhou (27 years old this year), in February 1936. Because he admired Chen's beauty, he seduced her in every possible way, and then rented a house at 5 Weihefang, Fangbang Road, and lured Chen to live with him. Chen became pregnant not long after living with Zhang, and gave birth to a daughter on January 4 of the following year at the Sino-German Hospital, named Zhang Gendi, who is now four years old. After Chen gave birth to her daughter, Zhang suddenly regarded Chen as a worn-out fan. After being abandoned, Chen was extremely angry. This summer, she hired Lawyer Shen Zongyong to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Zhang Huiming of refusing to recognize his biological daughter. After the court heard the case, it ruled that Zhang Huiming lost the lawsuit. Zhang refused to accept the ruling and recently hired Lawyer Zhuang Dingxun to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court, still denying that Zhang Gendi was his biological daughter. The case was recently heard by Xia Quande, the head of the Civil Court of the Third Branch of the High Court, accompanied by a judge and clerk. Chen Qinbao and Zhang Gendi still commissioned Lawyer Shen Zongyong to appear in court, detailing that Zhang Gendi was indeed Zhang Huiming's biological daughter. The court advised both parties that the case concerned personal matters and that reconciliation was the best solution, and then announced that the case would be postponed and the parties would try to reconcile out of court. If reconciliation was hopeless, the trial would continue. After the announcement, the court adjourned.

### A Gang of Thieves Hid Stolen Goods in a Hotel; A Large Batch of Silk Fabrics was Found; The Police Station Hopes that the Owners will go to Identify and Claim them

Mao Jinsheng, a Chinese detective from the French Concession Police Station, and detectives Ke Siqing and Ke Siqi, learned on the 24th of this month that Faxing Pawnshop on Diandang Street, Xinkang Inn on Minguo Road, and Shunhe Hotel on Xujiahui Road were all hiding places for gangs of thieves. Therefore, they went to search at the addresses separately, and arrested Chen Peiyi, Zhao Wenkui, Qian Zhaochang, Yu Songmao, Wang Liangren, Li Xinbi, Gao Mingxiu, Chen Baoyuan, Xu Jian, Chen Zijin, Cao Jiatang, Wang Deming, Liu Xiaowuzi, Zhu Changlong, and a total of fourteen other people, and seized a large number of stolen goods such as silk fabrics, Chinese and Western clothes, cigars, and cigarettes. They were all taken to the police station, detained for investigation, and then transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday for prosecution. After Judge Sun Pengxian interrogated them separately, he ordered them to be returned to custody, pending further questioning at a later date. As for the stolen goods, the police station is now very eager for the owners to go to the Detective Division of the Central Police Station in Lujiawan with a list to claim them.

### Shanxi Huqiao Bridge is Repaired; Traffic Resumes Today; Jiangxi Road Bridge is Still Closed

Shanxi Road Bridge, which spans the Suzhou River, has been closed since the middle of last month due to damage to the bridge and the start of repairs. It is now learned that the repair project has been fully completed yesterday, and traffic can resume today. In addition, because the bridge cannot carry too much weight, cargo trucks are prohibited from driving over the bridge. As for the Jiangxi Road Bridge, it has recently been closed for minor repairs. Both ends of the bridge are blocked by wire mesh. It is said that because the north side of the bridge is a Japanese military police area, it is now necessary to detour to the Tianhou Palace Bridge from Jiangxi Road to North Jiangxi Road. The saying that traffic will resume regularly yesterday must be postponed.

### Arts and Crafts Exhibition; The Solicited Items are Extremely Rich

Opening on the 23rd of Next Month; The Exhibition Period is Only Three Days in Total The Shanghai Refugee Production and Consumption Cooperative's Arts and Crafts Exhibition, which was initiated to raise production funds for refugees, is scheduled to open on the 23rd of next month at the Ningbo Fellow Association, and the exhibition period will be three days in total. It is divided into various departments such as calligraphy and painting, sculpture, movie stars, female roles, and stamps. Since issuing letters to various writers and collectors to solicit items, more than 1,000 pieces of calligraphy and painting have been received, and more than 500 movie star photos have also been received. Wang Jize is responsible for collecting stamps, and Zhang Chongren is soliciting sculptures. At the same time, famous calligrapher and painter Chen Tianxiao plans to participate in the exhibition with 500 pieces of his works that he plans to exhibit for the fifth time in Puyang. As for the performances of football, table tennis, Peking opera, etc., they will be implemented separately soon.

### The Water Level of the Yangtze River Estuary Drops Dramatically; Navigation Difficulties Become Increasingly Obvious

Recently, the water level in the Yangtze River area has dropped dramatically, and the water level outside the Wusong Estuary has also decreased accordingly. In the Pujiang River, when the tide is falling, it is difficult for ships with slightly deeper drafts to dock at the Bund, such as at the 16th Wharf. In the middle of next month, the water level will continue to drop, and the impact on shipping will be significant.

### A Morphine Den Was Cracked Down in Baoxing Lane

The Mailan Police Station of the French Concession cracked down on a morphine den set up by Koreans at 23 Baoxing Lane, Avenue Joffre the day before yesterday, and arrested a total of 24 men and women, including two Koreans. When the police detectives broke into the den, the Koreans resisted arrest, but were stopped by the detectives drawing their pistols. However, the main culprits, Zhang Genglin and Lizi Jing Ah Hu, were at large. The two Korean accomplices who were arrested have been escorted to the Korean Consulate for interrogation, while the Chinese are being detained for a thorough investigation to determine if they are involved before being handed over to the French authorities for handling.

### Five Robbers Punished

Feng Baishun, the Chinese detective chief of the Putuo Road Police Station, and detectives Kong Guangxiao and Chen Xianrong arrested Cui Youming and Wu Mengchu, robbers from Anhui, and six other suspects including Zhang Xingde, at the Xinxing Tea Garden at 3804 Roberts Road on the 10th of this month, and escorted them to the First Special District Court. It was investigated that Cui and other robbers, between October 28 and November 9, formed a gang to hold weapons and rob Wang Xueyi at 109 Wuding Road, Pan Chengyuan at 3272 Hede Road, Chai Rongtang at 412 Changping Road, Peng Zhaoshi at 258 Xiaoshadu Road, and Jin Zhushi at 9 Binglang Road, stealing property worth more than 600 yuan. They were instructed to pronounce the sentence on a regular basis. The suspect Zhang Xingde hired Lawyer Qian Xingzhong to defend him. The day before yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi pronounced the sentence in the Criminal Court: Cui Youming and Wu Mengchu were each sentenced to seven years in prison, Li Guangsheng and Tang Shengjie were each sentenced to six years, Yu Damo was sentenced to five years, and Zhang Xingde was found not guilty. During the appeal period, Qian Xingzhong, the acting lawyer for the robbers, requested that he be released on bail. Judge Jiang instructed him to submit a 600 yuan guarantee to allow him to suspend detention.

### A Female Servant Died of Poisoning from a Coal Ball Stove for Heating

The woman's name was Hu Chen, 49 years old, and she was a female servant of the Qian family at 122 Nanyang Road. Because it was cold, she was poisoned by a coal ball stove for heating in the room.

### Lost Cold Clothes Donation Booklet

Charitable people Yuan Ludeng, Le Genbao, etc., initiated the fundraising for cold clothes for refugees. Recently, various initiators have been fundraising separately, and the results have been remarkable. However, Yin Jun, the fundraiser for Donation Booklet No. 84, lost it the day before yesterday in a rickshaw at the entrance of Tianlefang Lane, Xieqiao Lane. All searches have been unsuccessful. Therefore, this statement is hereby declared invalid. If anyone finds it, please send it to Yuan Ludeng's Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. Otherwise, if the donation booklet is found to be fundraising outside, it is obviously fraudulent and the public should pay attention.

### Ningbo Authorities Stipulate Procedures for Elementary School Students to Audit Classes: Original School Recognizes Grades from Auditing School

(Yinxian News) Because Ningbo has suffered repeated bombings, the people are dispersed to the interior. The county authorities, to help elementary school children who have dispersed with their families to the countryside, have formulated important matters to be noted by elementary schools at all levels and methods for auditing classes. The following are excerpts from various points: (1) The above-mentioned children can enroll in nearby schools at the place of relocation by presenting a borrowing certificate from their original school without having to pay tuition again. (2) If the above-mentioned children pass the graduation examination of the school where they are auditing classes, they can request the original school to issue a certificate based on their report card. (3) The term examination grades of the above-mentioned children at the school where they are auditing classes will be counted as the term examination grades of the original students when they return to their original school. (4) Public and private elementary schools at all levels in the countryside should accommodate the above-mentioned children as much as possible, classifying them into different grades according to their original school level. (5) Elementary schools at all levels that accommodate auditing students must report the number of auditing students to the county government for record and may request the county government to transfer surplus teachers from elementary schools at all levels in the urban area to serve as teachers. It is also heard that this measure will soon be issued by the county government for implementation.

### A Glimpse of Talent Supply and Demand in Shanghai Two Years After the War (8)

— Pan Wen'an, Zheng Wenhan, Shen Guanglie

As for the reward for successful placement, whether it tends toward the job seeker's expectations or approaches the regulations of the recruiting agency, this can be compared in Tables 58 and 11.3. The percentage difference between job seekers who hope to get a reward of ten yuan or less and employers who are willing to offer this amount is very small, so there is no need to discuss it. For rewards of eleven to twenty yuan, job seekers who hope to get this amount account for 29.4%, and employers willing to offer this amount account for 14.65%, while successful placements also account for about 14%, which can be said to be extremely close to the employer's regulations. For rewards of 21 to 30 yuan, job seekers account for 17.8%, employers account for 7.7%, and successful placements account for 6.1%, which is slightly less than the regulations but far from the expectations. For rewards of 31 to 40 yuan, job seekers account for 7.3%, and employers account for about 19.4%, while successful placements account for 1.1%, which is also close to the percentage of employers. Looking at 41 to 50 yuan, job seekers account for 5.11%, employers account for 25.01%, and successful placements also account for 21.1%. This also proves that the reward for successful placement tends toward the employer's side. The other numbers are roughly the same. The reason is that the power of economics is in the hands of the employer, so job seekers naturally have to be more accommodating.

Classification of Rewards for Successful Placement (Table 11)

Salary Number Percentage

10 yuan or less 188 29.50

11-20 yuan 92 14.40

21-30 yuan 39 6.10

31-40 yuan 7 1.10

41-50 yuan 134 12.10

51-60 yuan 63 9.90

61-70 yuan 17 2.70

71-80 yuan 15 2.40

81-90 yuan 2 0.30

91-100 yuan 4 0.60

101-150 yuan 5 0.80

Commission 34 5.30

Negotiable 37 5.80

### Ministry of Education Agrees with Sun Yat-sen University to Accommodate Overseas Chinese Students Returning to China

(Kunming, 25th) The Ministry of Education, in order to accommodate overseas Chinese students who have recently returned to China and have undergone two rounds of screening tests by the Southwest Associated University, is making efforts to accommodate them. However, there are still many who failed or did not have time to take the test. Therefore, the Ministry has specially agreed with National Sun Yat-sen University to set up preparatory classes to accommodate them as much as possible in order to provide relief.

(Kunming Airmail) Since Mr. Pei Cunfan took over as mayor of Kunming, he has been working diligently and spare no effort. He especially recognizes education as the foundation of all municipal construction. Therefore, he hired educational experts Zeng Zuozhong, Cha Liangzhao, Luo Tingguang, Hu Shuyi, and Chen Yousong, who are staying in Yunnan, as members of the Municipal Government's Educational Design Committee to specialize in researching and planning the city's educational facilities and promotion work.

### Current Situation of Tongji University

(Kunming News) Recently, Japanese planes have come to bomb from time to time. As a result, all schools have moved to the four suburbs. Tongji came to Kunming relatively late, so it was not easy to find a superior school site, resulting in fragmentation. The school's colleges of engineering, science, and medicine, as well as the vocational high school attached to it, teach in five locations, each managing itself. The school building facilities are not very complete. The dormitory and classrooms of the attached high school are far apart. Now, Yiliang Goujie Town in the countryside has been selected, and the school building is used as a temple. At the end of October, teachers, students, and school equipment were moved there one after another. However, because various facilities have not been fully prepared, the original opening date of November 1st has been delayed. However, it will open soon.

In the three matches, East Sele defeated last year's runner-up West Catch team with a score of 4 to 3, West Forks defeated the former Group A team, which has now been relegated, Sucker, with a score of 5 to 0, and the emerging Group B team, Survey, eliminated the newly promoted Group A team, North West Child, with a score of 3 to 1. The audience at each match yesterday was very small, with less than 100 people in the Yiyuan and no one in the South grandstand. The results of each match yesterday are as follows: East Sele won against West Catch (Scott Cup) 4-3, West Forks won against Sucker (Scott Cup) 5-0, Survey Team won against North West Child (Scott Cup) 3-1, West Forks won against Portugal (Pre-Cup) 3-0, Youyou won against Ruowensi (Elementary Cup) 7-2, Russian Overseas won against Qiaotingsi (Elementary Cup) 7-2, Park Alliance won against Junior Club (Group B) 9-0

### Jingwu Individual Table Tennis Tournament: Rong Deneng Wins Championship, Qian Yushu Takes Second Place

The Jingwu Athletic Association, in order to celebrate the new building of the gym, held a members' individual table tennis championship in the gym at 9:00 AM yesterday to commemorate the occasion. More than 200 spectators from all walks of life watched with great enthusiasm. Unfortunately, the absence of strong players Ouyang Wei, Liang Shaoxiang, and Li Runcun reduced the excitement. Chairman Liang Jintang delivered a speech first, followed by referees Chen Linsheng and Ding Du giving the order to start the game. The competition adopted a knockout system to produce the champion and runner-up, so the players fought fiercely. Unfortunately, Guangdong team strong players were defeated by Rong Deneng, a good cutter, one after another, which was a pity. Another newcomer, Qian Yushu, relied on his skilled counter-draw and defeated strong pullers Fang Guanxin and Gui Jiying, and competed with Rong Deneng for the championship. Qian, a newborn calf not afraid of tigers, gave Rong a very strong blow and had hopes of winning. However, due to insufficient experience, he changed his tactics and lost to Rong by one to three. Qian failed at the last moment and retreated to the runner-up position. Rong Deneng won the championship with an undefeated record and will be awarded a prize on a scheduled date.

### Elementary Cup Soccer Tournament: Youyou Advances, Wins Against Ruowensi 7-2, Russian Overseas Eliminates Qiaotingsi

There were two preliminary matches in the Elementary Cup soccer tournament yesterday. Youyou and Ruowensi met at Jiaozhou Park. The two sides met in the Group C league match last week, and Youyou won 2-1. Yesterday, they competed again in the Cup match. Ruowensi fought bravely, hoping to avenge their defeat. In the first half, Youyou was against the wind. Sun Huipei scored first, followed by Ruowensi's right forward Brownlo and Yuan Kuntian, giving Youyou a 2-1 lead. Unexpectedly, one minute before the end of the first half, Wang Caigao held the ball and ran four steps and was penalized a wall ball, less than two yards from the goal. Jin shot hard and the ball bounced out, and was finally swept in, ending the first half with a score of 2-2. In the second half, Youyou was in a favorable position against the wind and controlled the whole game. Ruowensi could hardly cross the center line. Then Zhou Qilin, Han Longhai, and Sun Huipei scored five goals in succession, winning 7-2. One of Han Longhai's goals was shot from more than 30 yards away. Ruowensi's left defender's double mistake was absurd. Zhou Qilin's second goal was shot by Hu Youcheng from the center field, hit the crossbar, and Zhou rushed into the net. Sun Huipei's second goal was blown in by the wind, which was also ridiculous. Youyou is expected to win the Elementary Cup this season. In another Elementary Cup match yesterday, Russian Overseas also defeated Qiaodengsi 7-2. The score was the same as the match between Youyou and Ruowensi, which was also a coincidence.

### A Plan to Balance Rice Prices

— Bao Leti

Balancing rice prices is the unanimous call of all citizens. What is needed now is a practical and effective solution. I dare to offer my humble opinion for reference by all sectors.

Unclogging the Source

The imbalance between supply and demand allows unscrupulous merchants to manipulate prices, so the general public advocates unclogging the source. With the source open, rice prices will naturally be balanced. There is no dispute on this point. But at present, this proposition, like increasing production, is a high-sounding one. It should be known that the Japanese puppets' obstruction of the source is intended to harm the livelihoods of the citizens of Shanghai. We cannot negotiate with the tiger for its skin, nor can we wait until the victory of the war of resistance. Therefore, we can only take advantage of the weakness of the Japanese puppets, who must constantly extort money to maintain their income, to ensure a steady flow of rice production from the occupied areas to Shanghai. What is this method? Only by adopting a scorched-earth determination and implementing a joint procurement or joint cessation of procurement method can we achieve this goal. This requires a strong organization.

Guild System

The government's power is far away from Shanghai, so the general public advocates handing over the control to the various trade associations. It should be known that trade associations are originally organizations of free economy. Their main purpose is to seek the interests of the industry. However, the so-called interests, like speculation, can be divided into spot and futures. Abandoning immediate profits for long-term profits is not something that can be done without foresight; nor can it be understood by ordinary merchants in general; and the benefits of controlled economy mostly belong to futures. The guild has no power to force its members to execute laws. Therefore, it is clear that the guild has no ability to control rice prices.

Concession Authorities

The current concession authorities have many things to do, but the price of rice, which is related to the people's food, is as important as the work of security; this is not only for the sake of social security, but also for the prosperity of the social economy. Because expensive rice will make all things more expensive, and the general purchasing power will fall even more. If this continues, the current prosperity will inevitably go bankrupt; this is exactly what the Japanese puppets are seeking. Since the guild is unable to control rice prices, the only ones who can do so are the authorities of the two concessions; moreover, whether the rice price returns to normal or not is closely related to the security and interests of the concession, as mentioned above, and cannot be ignored.

Realistic Approach

Some people have requested the concession to set up grain storage, which is a high-sounding proposition and provides unscrupulous merchants with an excuse to manipulate prices. This is because of the fear of injuring the vase when trying to kill the rat, and of startling the snake when beating the grass. Moreover, in fact, there are plenty of warehouses available in the concession, so there is no need to start from scratch. And we know for sure that the existing grain reserves are enough to last for four or five months; so there is no need to panic so much. The current problem is:

(1) To force rice prices back to normal, it is necessary to control rice first.

(2) To maintain a fixed reserve, it is necessary to implement joint procurement first.

(3) To eradicate the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, it is necessary to reorganize the rice market.

Therefore, the author once suggested on a certain occasion that "checking storage," "setting a public price," "unifying procurement and transportation," and implementing a "rice industry licensing system" should all be handled by a committee specially set up by the concession authorities and staffed by impartial people.

Checking Storage

This is not only necessary for regulating the supply and demand of grain, but also the most effective way to expose unscrupulous merchants who manipulate rice prices and then punish them. Therefore, the purpose of the inspection is here. Even if the amount of rice stored is large, there is no need to announce it. The authorities controlling rice prices should be responsible to the entire city for maintaining the publicly set price and how to maintain the publicly set price. If they use the amount of rice stored to stabilize people's hearts, they will again make the mistake of startling the snake when beating the grass. The reason why past announcements of the amount of rice stored were suitable for creating air for unscrupulous merchants lies here. The method of checking storage is:

(1) Issue a notice to all rice merchants and warehouse owners in the city to report the amount of rice stored to the concession authorities within ten days and register it. Late registrations will be rejected.

(2) During the registration and inspection period, the stored rice must not be moved, but the number of pieces that each rice merchant can take out to the market shall be stipulated.

(3) Once the registration is completed, the inspection will begin. Those who underreport will have their stored rice exceeding the registered number confiscated and used for price stabilization; or used as a reserve for public warehouses.

Public Rice Price

The limit price system has the disadvantage of being too fixed and easily unsuitable for reality. And once the market price approaches the limit price, people panic. Unscrupulous merchants can take the opportunity to act. Therefore, we should adopt a public rice price system in the future. The public rice price does not need to return to the full incoming price at present. Because the high price of rice is actually caused by the mutual cause and effect between unscrupulous merchants and the Japanese puppets. This point has been explained in detail in the past week of this publication in the previous issue, so I will not repeat it here. In short: 14 yuan per dan of rice is definitely not too low. The hoarders deserve to lose money because of their high incoming prices. Since the public rice price in Shanghai is low, the extortion of the Japanese puppets will also have its limits. However, the implementation of a public rice price without the backing of forced sales and joint procurement cannot be maintained.

Forced Sales

Therefore, the amount of rice stored obtained from the inspection must be allocated to each household according to the actual needs of the market, and the execution must be enforced. However, when allocating the amount of sales proportionally, it is also possible to examine their usual accounts to find an average transaction amount and handle it.

Joint Procurement

Harming the livelihood of Shanghai citizens is one of the reasons why the Japanese puppets obstruct the transportation of rice to Shanghai. However, they also have the weakness of having to release rice for export in order to obtain extortion income. However, during free procurement, they can blackmail them individually and do whatever they want. As a result, the incoming prices vary, and rice prices increase without decreasing. However, during unified procurement, they can no longer use their usual skills. In the beginning of the implementation, they will definitely make things difficult. But we should have the determination to break the cauldron and sink the boat, rather eat expensive foreign rice than give in. Those who give in must be the Japanese puppets and not this city. Because the only way for rice production in the occupied areas at present is to be transported to Shanghai. The Japanese's purchase is also nothing more than to resell it to Chinese merchants in Shanghai. Transporting it back to Japan or transferring it to the Japanese military rations are all fabrications by unscrupulous merchants, which can be verified by Japanese customs records. If Shanghai does not import rice, farmers in the occupied areas will be restless as a result. This is not what the Japanese puppets want to hear, and they cannot tolerate it even more without extortion income. Since we have this determination, judging from the current rice storage situation, it is not necessary to eat expensive foreign rice immediately. Even if it is necessary, it will be four or five months later. I am afraid that the Japanese puppets will not be able to persist during this period and will give in immediately.

Licensing System

The above methods cannot be stopped because of the opposition or non-cooperation of rice merchants. If this situation occurs, it is possible to cancel their business licenses; and implement a licensing system. Grant licenses to a number of merchants in the city to handle the rice industry. Although this method has the danger of monopoly; it is definitely not a problem under a public rice price. Like today's water and electricity, fortunately, it is a monopoly enterprise, so citizens have not been oppressed by relentless price increases.

Consumer Cooperation

The above methods should be carried out quickly, but whether the seat concession authorities can adopt them? There may be problems. Therefore, we should also be prepared to prevent the concession authorities from failing to handle it. The most effective way to prepare is for all sectors to quickly handle consumer cooperation. The method is:

Major businesses, factories, or school organizations should immediately carry out joint procurement cooperation for all employees. This joint procurement should be carried out directly to the place of production. Whether it is domestic rice or foreign rice, only direct procurement can avoid the interference of unscrupulous merchants. However, it is difficult for individuals to carry out it alone.

However, employees have limited income, and joint procurement is inevitably restricted by cash; this depends on the understanding of the capital side and other authorities, and mutual cooperation. It should be known that rather than paying rice subsidies due to expensive rice, or responding to requests for wage increases; it is better to assist employees in joint procurement, which can stabilize rice prices and be a one-time solution.

### Should Shanghai's National Industries Be Maintained?

— Yang'an

The August 13th Incident erupted, and most of the national industries in Shanghai and the surrounding areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were destroyed by airplanes and artillery. At that time, the government, considering the unpredictable future of the situation, planned to move factories along the coast inland, preparing to rebuild them in the southwest and northwest, in order to preserve strength and enhance resistance. Unexpectedly, in November of the 26th year (1937), the war situation changed abruptly, and the battle line moved westward. At this time, some of the factories in Shanghai and along the Shanghai-Nanjing line had not yet been completely relocated. In the chaos of war, transportation was blocked, and it became almost impossible to move the heavy equipment inland via Hong Kong. Therefore, rather than dismantling the machinery and transporting it inland, it was more cost-effective to start anew inland and rebuild. At the same time, in order to maintain the livelihoods of employees and preserve the original market, it was necessary to salvage what remained and move to the Shanghai concessions, seeking to partially resume operations. These factories, which had survived the ravages of war and were rebuilding, accounted for the majority of Shanghai's industry after the war. After the spring of the 27th year (1938), the exchange rate of the national currency fell, and prices soared. The sales of manufactured goods from the rear became quite strong; at the same time, due to the boycott of Japanese goods, Hong Kong and various Nanyang ports also absorbed a large number of national goods. At this time, the population of Shanghai also increased sharply, and the demand for supplies grew. Under these favorable circumstances, a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand for national goods was created. Where there is profit, people will flock to it. Within this year, new small factories sprang up like bamboo shoots after rain. And most of them had surpluses; in this way, a small-scale prosperous situation in industry was formed. Statistics show that by the end of the 27th year, the number of factories in the Shanghai concessions had reached more than 4,700, more than double the number before the war, and only more than 800 fewer than the total number of factories in the city before the war.

Current Difficulties

The products of Shanghai's national goods factories, in addition to supplying the consumption of the people in the concessions and being shipped to various Nanyang ports, were mainly sold to the rear. Although the raw materials for national goods had to rely on imports to some extent due to geographical restrictions, the capital for setting up factories and the labor for manufacturing were all owned by the Chinese. Therefore, buying products from Shanghai factories was about 30% cheaper in foreign exchange than buying purely foreign goods. From this point of view, it seems necessary to maintain the current national goods factories in Shanghai. Although the government's relocation westward meant that it could not temporarily reach Shanghai, as long as the leaders of the national industries in the special zone were loyal and maintained their integrity, they would still be our productive force; there is no reason for the people to firmly believe in them and the government to abandon them first. For the past two years, the economic and administrative authorities have consistently adhered to this position. They have carefully reviewed and effectively approved applications from Shanghai factories for registration certificates, etc., which is truly worthy of our praise. However, on the other hand, Shanghai's industrial sector has been encountering great difficulties in the past year: first, the problem of remittances from the interior to the port; second, the problem of capital supply.

First, let's talk about the remittance problem. The reason why Shanghai factories need remittances from the rear to the port stems from the following two facts: (1) Those who have already established branch factories in the rear, or are building branch factories, must remit funds from the rear to Shanghai and Hong Kong to prepare for the purchase of raw materials, the addition of equipment, and the payment of transportation costs. This need, I am afraid, exists for all factories in the rear, including state-owned factories. (2) After the factories in Shanghai transport their products to the interior for sale, the proceeds must be remitted back to the Shanghai factories to prepare for the purchase of raw materials, the payment of wages and transportation costs, and the maintenance of the continuous turnover of the factory. However, since the government tightened control over foreign exchange, the Financial Supervisory Bureau, in order to prevent capital flight, strictly restricted the remittance of national currency to the port. The inland branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank did very little Shanghai-Hong Kong remittance business each day, and refused to accept remittances beyond the limit without any reason. In Chongqing and other ports, there were often people who wanted to remit 100 yuan of legal tender to Shanghai, waiting from dawn to noon, and being turned away repeatedly for several days. As for commercial banks, although they could accept remittances within a certain limit, the remittance fees were shockingly high. Under these circumstances, it was impossible for factories in the interior to purchase raw materials and machinery and pay the necessary transportation costs at the port; it was also impossible for factories in Shanghai to remit the proceeds from sales in the interior back to the Shanghai factories to continue production and supply the rear. We believe that the financial authorities' approach of "abandoning food because of choking" needs to be reconsidered and improved. Because if some or all of the factories in the interior need to use foreign raw materials, they will of course have to close down once the supply is cut off. New factories will not be able to purchase equipment at the port and will have to suspend construction. If factories in Shanghai cannot transport their proceeds to Shanghai, they can only reduce production and seek other ways to compensate. The resulting situation will inevitably lead to soaring prices of manufactured goods in the interior, and even a break in supply, which will further deteriorate the lives of the people, or it is not impossible for foreign goods to take advantage of the situation.

The second problem is the capital supply problem. Statistics show that after August 13th in Shanghai, the number of bank deposits and inventories increased significantly compared to before the war. On the demand side, some industries have been destroyed by artillery fire, so the number of lending targets has decreased. The local products in the vicinity of Shanghai are subject to Japanese control and cannot be freely transported and sold; the imported foreign goods have also shown a decrease due to a sharp decrease in demand; therefore, the banks' commodity loans have also decreased significantly. In this way, with the supply of funds exceeding demand, the industrial sector, which is solid in content and legitimate in business, should theoretically be able to obtain a sufficient supply of funds; however, in reality, this is not the case. Despite the fact that bank funds are idle and the New Remittance Plan of 50 million yuan from the Joint Reserve Committee has not been used up to half, all banks are making every effort to shrink their loans to factories and avoid them as if they were plagues after the Ministry of Finance's telegram restrictions on withdrawals; it is said that even those who had already signed overdraft contracts were stopped from continuing to be accommodated. Under this kind of pressure, the suffering of the industrial sector is not difficult to imagine. And looking back at the speculative market, since the outbreak of the European War, there have been many people who have competed to buy foreign exchange and hoard goods, hoping to profit from speculation, especially people engaged in the financial sector. We cannot help but lament the moral decline of the people for this kind of means of harming others and benefiting oneself; moreover, most of the word "benefiting oneself" is still just wishful thinking. The original intention of the Ministry of Finance's telegram was to curb speculation; now, speculation has not disappeared, but industry has been destroyed first; I am afraid that this is also beyond the expectations of the authorities.

The Nature of Isolated Island Industry

Should the government maintain Shanghai's national industry at the current stage? The answer to this question should be given after first examining the current content and production and sales situation of Shanghai factories and the impact on our country's politics and economy, both in terms of advantages and disadvantages. First, let's talk about the production aspect: first, in terms of raw materials, perhaps most factories, due to geographical restrictions, inevitably rely on foreign goods in part or in whole. As long as they do not use Japanese goods, we believe that this method of purchasing foreign raw materials and processing them ourselves can be tolerated during the transition period. Because our country's native products are subject to innate limitations, all factories were already like this before the war, let alone the fact that most of the country that produces raw materials has now fallen. In this regard, a large amount of raw materials must be imported every year; but it is always more cost-effective than importing all foreign manufactured goods. Second is capital. We can assert that all factories run by Chinese are purely Chinese capital, and there are very few joint ventures with foreigners. Third is labor. Currently, the national goods factories in Shanghai can be said to be all Chinese labor, and managed by Chinese, and even foreign technicians are rarely seen. Looking at it from the opposite perspective, if these factories all stop production, wouldn't the unemployment of tens of thousands of employees become an extremely serious social problem? Fourth is land. Factories operating in the Shanghai Special Zone, their factory bases and buildings, are protected by the police power of the concessions, and can still maintain a detached position, not subject to the interference of anyone.

Let's talk about the sales aspect: currently, the sales destinations of Shanghai's national goods factory products are roughly the following: first, the interior of the rear. Daily-use manufactured goods are necessary for the lives of the military and civilians in the rear, and the annual consumption is very large. Before the completion of industrial construction in the southwestern and northwestern provinces, it is not too much to use the favorable production conditions of the Shanghai Special Zone to manufacture daily necessities for the military and civilians in the rear and save the government a huge amount of foreign exchange. Second, Hong Kong and various Nanyang ports. After the depreciation of the national currency exchange rate, it is conducive to export trade. Most of the population in Hong Kong and Nanyang ports are overseas Chinese. Driven by patriotic sentiments, they have boycotted Japanese goods and switched to buying national goods in recent years. Therefore, they have absorbed a large number of products from Shanghai factories, increasing a part of foreign exchange income for our country's international balance of payments, and at the same time laying the foundation for the market for national goods to be sold in the south, relatively weakening the enemy's trade power. Third, the Shanghai Special Zone and various occupied areas. The consumption of more than four million people in the Shanghai Special Zone should be supplied by national goods, which does not need to be repeated. What needs to be studied now is whether national goods should be transported to the occupied areas for sale under possible conditions? At present, most of the people in the occupied areas, except for a very small number of people who work for the enemy, are people who "are in the rivers and lakes, but their hearts are with the imperial court." Therefore, it can be said that although the land has fallen, the people are still ours. With this premise, it is of course appropriate to allow the transportation and supply of national goods, so as to avoid inferior goods from taking their place; as long as the sales organization in the interior is sound and the national goods factories in Shanghai are closely monitored, the danger of aiding the enemy can be prevented. We can perceive the need for this matter simply by thinking about it from the opposite perspective. Assuming that national goods are prohibited from being transported to various war zones, then not only will the mobile troops and the general public not be able to buy national goods for consumption, resulting in creating opportunities for Japanese goods to be dumped, but it will also be enough to weaken the patriotic enthusiasm of the people. Therefore, looking at the occupied areas at the current stage, we cannot find sufficient reasons to prohibit the transportation and sale of national goods.

Summarizing the above analysis, the existence of national industries in the Shanghai Special Zone seems to be more beneficial than harmful to the national economy and cannot be denied. Then, it is of course the government's duty to provide strong relief to the current difficulties of the factories.

Recommendations for Relief Measures

The method of relieving Shanghai's national industries should of course be targeted at the current difficulties, prescribing the right medicine for the illness. In short, it can be divided into:

First, responsible personnel should be dispatched by the central financial and economic administrative authorities to Shanghai to jointly investigate the current production and sales situation and internal organization of various factories with various public organizations in order to understand the true situation of the content.

Second, the central financial authorities should supervise the Joint Office of the Four Banks to notify the branches of each bank in the interior and Shanghai to accept as much as possible applications for remittances from the aforementioned identified factories that have conclusive proof, and implement the "Provisional Measures for Facilitating Domestic Remittances" approved by the Ministry of Finance to ensure thoroughness.

Third, the central financial authorities should order the Four Banks Collateral Committee to expand the Shanghai industrial collateral amount; encourage various commercial banks to jointly handle industrial loans, or organize industrial loan syndicates to lend to factories with solid content and reliable collateral; at the same time, order the Four Banks Collateral Committee and the Shanghai Banking Association Joint Preparatory Committee to use the method of re-mortgage to support commercial banks. This allows funds to be used in a proper way, or may reduce speculative activities.

The above three items are all hoped to be planned and implemented by the government. If you want to get the sympathy and assistance of others, you must first have a sound organization, sufficient public content, and a loyal national concept. We earnestly hope that Shanghai's factories will maintain their integrity, strengthen their determination, rectify their internal affairs, and strive to enhance the strength of the national economy. At the same time, in order to demonstrate fairness, we suggest that you quickly and voluntarily handle

First, organize an industrial joint organization, and invite the Joint Office of the Four Banks, the Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and experts from various industries to participate in a detached position to regularly handle the investigation and identification of the content, production, and sales of various factories, etc., for the consultation of the government and the financial sector. The qualifications for membership must be strict, and it is better to have a shortage than to be lax, so as to avoid abuses. With such an organization in place, the review work in handling remittances and loans may be much more convenient.

Second, Shanghai's factories should settle and sell foreign exchange to the domestic branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's regulations on the settlement and sale of foreign exchange for exported goods, in order to increase the government's foreign exchange income.

In short: the key to winning the War of Resistance is national strength first; on the government's side, rather than passively letting the factories in the special zone fend for themselves, treating them as uncivilized, or even forcing them to take risks, it is better to actively supervise them strictly and support them in order to preserve the country's vitality and enhance the strength of resistance and construction.

### Grains When it Arrives, it Surges Rice Price Plummets

The rice market was still tight yesterday morning after it became a sensation again. Upon investigation, the wave of today's price increase of two yuan is nothing more than speculators making trouble, and the general hoarding households also echoed it. Therefore, once the price increase occurs, it is often difficult to contain. The previous price of japonica rice once reached the 40 yuan mark, so everyone believed that this price increase would not be inferior to the past, or even break the mark and create a new peak. Driven by their hopeful thoughts, they immediately ignored everything and searched for rice, creating a good opportunity for out-of-town merchants to profit and lift prices beyond the normal range. As a result, the prices of japonica and indica rice rose sharply by more than two yuan in an instant. However, the thoughts of the general local stores are different. Seeing the market getting higher, they become more discouraged. Because their situation is different, and their capital scope is smaller, they inevitably rely on the market for sales and sell gradually. The outlet is restricted and the cost is quite high. Unlike the general hoarding households, who have sufficient strength, they pull in and throw out, which is flexible and mobile. Therefore, they often encounter changes that are difficult to grasp. Therefore, having learned from previous lessons, they are always cautious. Whenever the price first rises, they also follow the trend of competing for purchases. However, when they see the peak, they all maintain a stable attitude, stand by and watch, and only slightly add to their purchases. Therefore, yesterday's market was sluggish when it was soaring. The local stores were the only ones that were weak because they believed that the profits were small and the burden was heavy. Therefore, after the market had risen sufficiently, the situation stabilized. And the general hoarding households, seeing that the situation had changed, also gradually stopped and transferred their efforts. Until noon, there were few inquiries, and both retail and wholesale markets became stagnant. What was worse, the foreign rice held in the hands of the Beiyang gang was sold off again, falling from 34 yuan to 33 yuan, and people's hearts became more and more empty. If the out-of-town merchants sell off one after another, they will have a lot of remaining goods in their hands. In addition, the goods from Sujia Kuntai Qing Si Feng Lian, etc., arrived in large quantities yesterday, taking advantage of the rising market in Shanghai, with a total of more than 40 cars. The merchants were chilled and eager to unload their goods, and their efforts to unload became even stronger. The hoarding households also withdrew their greed and returned to sell in droves, but there were few transactions. In this chaotic situation, the prices of all goods had fallen back by varying amounts of one or two yuan. As a result, the closing market price, although still increased by 45 cents compared to the previous, can be called stable in terms of the two yuan increase and decrease first and last. The prices were as follows: Changzhen special japonica rice 38 yuan, special japonica rice 37 yuan 30 cents, 37 yuan, Kunsu high japonica rice 36 yuan to 35 yuan 50 cents, Qingjiao special thin rice 334 yuan, Fengjia thin rice 323 yuan, Luyang sharp rice 334 yuan, Jingwu sharp rice opened at 34 yuan in the early market, but only 33 yuan 30 cents and 33 yuan 50 cents later, Saigon and Annam japonica rice 33 yuan to 33 yuan 50 cents.

### Sugar Market Factory Ice Returns to Small Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market stabilized. The association set the price: No. 24 coarse white sugar from this warehouse was 53 yuan, foreign warehouse 53 yuan 15 cents, transit goods 42 yuan 50 cents, Taikoo Chebai B mark West warehouse 56 yuan 50 cents, East warehouse 56 yuan, DY mark 53 yuan 50 cents, HX mark 52 yuan 70 cents, H mark Chechi 38 yuan 60 cents, Dutch red 41 yuan to 41 yuan 50 cents, this factory's cotton white No. 1 53 yuan, No. 2 52 yuan 50 cents, this factory's ice 63 yuan, Jingming ice 64 yuan 50 cents, all down by about 1 yuan.

### Seafood Codfish is Strong

Codfish is in short supply for a long time, resulting in gradually thin bottom inventory, and high-quality goods are even more scarce. The market situation is tight. Currently, Ningbo codfish is sold at 60 yuan, up 13 yuan from before. Zhoushan goods and Yantai codfish are sold at 100 yuan, rising to a degree of 20 yuan.

### Coal Haifeng White Coal The Market is Strong on the Outside and Dry on the Inside

Haifeng white coal has been weak in the market recently due to the large amount of arrivals. The market is strong on the outside and dry on the inside, and transactions are also very sluggish. Because both the industry's hoarding customers have a lot of goods in their hands, they are waiting and watching, and the market also dares not take it. The industry splits the price, lump coal is 106 yuan per ton, and hoarding customers sell it for only about 100 yuan. Door-to-door retail, mentioning lump coal is 112 yuan per ton, Lingjiao 116 yuan, and Tong lump 110 yuan, delivered to customers, including industry profits.

### Material Utilization Supplement

— Qiu Lang

After reading Mr. Chen Liang's article "Material Utilization" in the previous issue (November 20) of this publication, which talked about how old and broken items can be made useful after being modified, especially for people in the salary class during this extraordinary period, with more than half of their income reduced, the so-called "living within one's means" and "turning waste into useful items" can indeed supplement the economy. Mr. Chen is truly a mindful person. Now I also want to come up with a few discarded items, which can be applied after modification, as a sequel and submit it to this publication. .

Old writing brushes with no nibs are mostly thrown into the wastepaper basket, which is a pity! You may as well accumulate ten or eight, wash the nibs with clean water, arrange them neatly and tie them tightly with thin rope, and you have a row of brushes (also called board brushes), which can be used to dip paste and paste the windows of the room.

When old and broken clothes and socks, etc., cannot be worn again, you can take them to remove the buttons and trims, wash them clean and dry them in the sun, stack them neatly and paste them into "cloth boards" to be used as insoles for children's shoes. If not, tear them into cloth strips and tie them to a round wooden stick to make a broom. Because brooms are heavily worn when wiping the floor, making them extremely easy to break, you can change the worn-out clothes and old socks again, so you don't have to buy broom heads often.

Calendars are changed every year. When changing, the old ones are discarded at hand, which is also a pity! Why not write memos or practice writing on the blank reverse side, its function is no less than tearing a paper notebook. As for the sharpened end of a spent matchstick, it can be used as a toothpick. Some people think it has toxic substances: in fact, after soaking it in clean water for a day or two, and waiting for it to dry, the toxic substances will also be eliminated and it can be used. What's more, high-quality cigar ash is said to be able to brush teeth. Rust-covered cigarette cans can have fine holes chiseled into them and used to water flowers (new ones are even more useful). For other miscellaneous utensils, if they are slightly damaged, repair them if you can repair them, and replace them if you can replace them, always with the principle of saving money. It not only cultivates a good habit of cherishing things, but also is a key to getting through the difficult extraordinary period.

### Wool Thread Re-dyeing Method

— Fan Xuehui

It's getting cold, and it's the season for making cold clothes again. Wool thread has become a popular cold-proof product for the people of our country. Almost every child and adult has a wool thread underwear or outerwear, especially women.

However, at a time when foreign exchange is tight and prices are soaring, we have to save a little. Now I offer the old wool thread re-dyeing method to housewives.

Gray: Most suitable for re-dyeing dark gray or neutral color, you can use two cents or one tael of acid neutral color.

Light yellow: Most suitable for re-dyeing golden yellow, group green, coffee, dark green, etc. To dye golden yellow, you can use five cents of acid peach red. To dye emerald green, you can use five cents of emerald green pigment. To dye dark coffee, you can dye with a combination of acid neutral color and acid snuff. If you want to dye dark green, you can use five cents of product blue.

Light green: Most suitable for re-dyeing navy blue, you can dye with a combination of eight cents of acid product blue, two cents of acid neutral color, and two cents of acid vermilion.

Dark red: Most suitable for re-dyeing purple sauce, you can dye with a combination of three cents of acid neutral color and seven cents of acid dark red. In addition, you can also re-dye navy blue.

Other colors such as adzuki bean paste can also be re-dyed dark coffee or navy blue.

The above pigment configuration is calculated according to ten taels of wool thread.

Dyeing method: first soak the wool thread in hot water. Dissolve the pigment in a magnetic cup or bowl with boiling water, put it in a pot or basin, and also put a considerable amount of water in the pot. Then pour the pigment liquid into the pot, and then put the wool thread into the pot. Place it on the stove and slowly turn it to make the heat even. Cook for half an hour. It is better to add a little glacial acetic acid when dyeing.

After taking it out, wash the pigment water clean, and the color will be bright and will not fade.

### Walking in the Air

— Lu Lishi

Everyone thinks that flying in the air is a very common thing, but I'm afraid there are still many people who don't know about people "walking" in the air! Airplanes can only carry people because they have an engine, and their actions cannot be as arbitrary and satisfying as one would like. Humans have long understood that this is a shortcoming of airplanes. Scientists' minds are especially sharp. They have carefully studied it and improved it bit by bit—the invention of "walking" in the air, called "gliding machine" or glider. Here, I will introduce it.

People who have taken a plane will always feel that when flying at high altitude, everything on the ground is blurry, but the "gliding machine" is not like that. It can glide in the air 70 feet above the ground, it can come in a moment and go in a moment. If you happen to turn around while picking out an object, the object in front of you will suddenly disappear. People who walk in the air with a "gliding machine" are truly immortals and truly demons. I am not talking nonsense, because Europe has already used this kind of machine as a "competition" toy.

The structure of the "gliding machine" is very simple. There is no engine, so no gasoline is needed. It is made of steel pipes or wood into several skeletons, and then two narrow and long wings are installed. It relies on the power of car towing, the power of airplanes taking off, and the power of winch launching to rise into the high air, but soon it gets rid of people's help and can walk leisurely in the air with the drift of the air currents without danger. It is also gentle when landing on the ground. Even a ten-year-old child in England takes this toy, let alone adults. How convenient and economical it would be to put a few "gliding machines" on the top of Mount Tai, Mount Heng, and other scenic mountains in China for tourists to take down the mountain!

It can also change direction when walking in the air. A rudder is installed behind the seat cushion. When people turn the rudder in front, it will follow your wishes.

### Ode to Beggar's Chicken

— Sun Choucheng

Beggar's chicken is a specialty of Changshu. It involves covering a plump chicken with mud and baking it in a fire, so the flavor does not escape. When eaten, it has a fragrant aroma and a unique flavor. Previously, to taste this dish, one had to go to Yu Mountain. Now, it is also available in Shanghai. The other day, after eating, Ye Songxian and Miao Yonglou, two poetic elders, praised it incessantly, each composing inscriptions with elegant allusions, making for a delightful anecdote for a cookbook.

(1) The ingredients are taken from the homes of Yue merchants (Yue chickens are plump and tender). The method is fixed to come from the Wu dialect market. (Wu Zixu played the flute in the Wu market and acted as a beggar). There's no need to frequently beg from door to door, acting like a fool about to be sealed in a jar. (2) Bound by clay, not leaking spring's essence, happily taking from the neighbors every day. From now on, I won't eat food that's condescendingly given. Zilu would surely laugh at the old man. (3) The frozen duck is said to be beautiful, like sisters-in-law. The big cooking of Zheng meat is talked about like Dongpo. Since beggar's chicken has arrived, famous scholars and beauties are helpless. (The above three quatrains are by Mr. Ye Songxian.) Once, Dongpo pork was renowned. Now, gluttons add beggar's chicken. Chicken and pork are still chicken and pork in essence. The taste varies depending on the different methods, distinguishing high and low. The noisy chicken seller confronts the chicken buyer. The difference between fragrance and foulness lies in self-cultivation. From this, we know that fools can sometimes get one thing right. Why use a butcher's knife to slaughter a pheasant? Regulating yin and yang by cooking with a lively fire, covered with salt and plums in a mud ball. Though the skin and feathers remain, the heart and intestines have been replaced. Ascending the tripod and cauldron, it replaces Qijie's dwelling. The soft, warm, milky flesh is as beautiful as Yang Guifei. The delicate little tongue is better than Xishi's. (Xishi's tongue is also a dish.) The fragrant, sparse toes have no such taste (sacrificing to the pheasant is called sparse toes). The community banquet will bring wine along. I'm ashamed to Yi Ya claims to know the taste. Even after many cookings, it loses to Bai Lixi. It should be added to Yuan Lang's new cookbook. The beautiful production of Qi is enough to make a wife proud. Try to observe the prime minister of a state wearing a heroic helmet, the minced meat, flute playing, and gifting of silk. The chicken coop is not short of those who haven't danced like cranes. Is butchering dogs only for the pleasure of eating? The prominence and obscurity of people have no fixed fate. Fortunately, fame is achieved through evaluation.

### The Most Suitable Foods for Infants (Part 2)

— Physician Zhu Ye

Cod Liver Oil: It is best to give infants cod liver oil early on, starting with a small amount. By the fourth month, give about three teaspoons a day, or gradually increase the amount from two drops to ten drops. According to Dr. Martha Eliot, start from the third week after birth, half a teaspoon twice a day, one teaspoon twice a day in the second month, and one and a half teaspoons twice a day in the third month. This amount can be continued for two years. Cod liver oil can also be added to milk or orange juice to avoid its fishy smell and make it easier to take. Infants have a strong tolerance for cod liver oil. Therefore, infants with a tendency to rickets, premature infants, and infants with nutritional disorders should take it early.

Vegetable Soup: Vegetable soup should also have meat and grains added to it. For example, add a small amount of chopped beef, mutton, or chicken to green vegetables, along with one potato, one turnip, two tablespoons of rice, and a little salt. Boil with water for three hours. Adding tomatoes and peas is also good. Start giving this vegetable soup from the sixth month, giving two tablespoons with breast milk at 2 PM. Gradually increase to thirty tablespoons, reducing the amount of milk by three tablespoons.

Vegetable Puree: Cook green vegetables into a meat and vegetable puree. If the child has already eaten vegetable soup, give this vegetable puree around the eleventh month. Otherwise, if only eating vegetable puree, start at the sixth month, giving it at 2 PM with breast milk. Initially, give it three times a week, giving spinach. On the other four days, give carrots, peas, asparagus, lettuce, etc., one teaspoon at a time, gradually increasing the amount to one tablespoon in the seventh month, two tablespoons by the eighth month, and three tablespoons by the ninth month. Continue with three tablespoons thereafter. After one year, give pumpkin, white turnip, kohlrabi, cabbage, etc., mixing two or three kinds at a time. The water used to cook the vegetables contains valuable salts and should not be discarded. Mix half a teaspoon of butter with one tablespoon of vegetable puree. This not only makes the vegetable puree taste better, but also increases its nutritional value.

Meat Juice: Chop half a pound of lean beef and extract the juice using a meat juicer. Add a small amount of salt. Start from the fifth or ninth month, one teaspoon a day, gradually increasing the amount to three to six tablespoons. Give it to anemic babies slightly earlier. Sometimes, when the baby has a strong tolerance for meat juice and becomes excited and cannot sleep, temporarily stop giving it.

Egg: First, give the yolk, usually starting from the fifth month. It can be half-cooked or fully cooked. Initially, mix it with orange juice or milk and give it with breast milk at 2 PM. After the yolk is completely tolerated, start giving a very small amount of egg white. By the thirteenth or fourteenth month, give the whole egg.

Bread: Give it after the baby has teeth. First, give toast or crackers.

Fruit: Apples are the most suitable fruit for babies. Start from the tenth month, giving cooked apples or strained cooked apples. Give it at the same time as milk. Bananas should be started from the thirteenth or fourteenth month.

The above is an overview of the various "complementary foods" for infants. However, in cases of illness or special circumstances, it should only be given after guidance from a doctor.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

New pickled meat is on the market again. If you're tired of eating fresh meat, why not change your taste and eat some pickled meat? It's very suitable for eating with rice. The weather has suddenly turned cold these few days. A bowl of pickled meat and tofu soup with some fresh garlic is very palatable. However, this soup must be eaten hot. If it's neither hot nor cold, it doesn't taste as good. As for the pickled meat, it doesn't have to be put in the soup. Like Hangzhou-style stewed pork, it can be sliced and eaten separately, which is very chewy. If you like pickled meat but are reluctant to give up fresh meat, then you can have them cooperate and make a bowl of stewed pickled fresh meat. If you want to be more refined, add some diced winter bamboo shoots, and it will naturally be even more delicious. In addition, there is another method: cut the pickled vegetables into small pieces and steam them together with the pickled meat. This is also a good dish to eat with rice. This is Ningbo flavor, and it is expected that Ningbo people will definitely love it. Monday: Pickled meat and tofu soup, salted vegetables with braised yellow croaker, fried day lily, braised radish slices. Tuesday: Shepherd's purse fried pork slices, fragrant mushroom stewed abalone, stir-fried cellophane noodles with green vegetables, spinach with braised tofu. Wednesday: Celery and shredded beef, braised bluefish slices, salted vegetables with soybean sprouts, dried shredded bean curd, golden flower vegetables. Thursday: Pickled vegetables steamed with pickled meat, salted fish stewed tofu, shepherd's purse with bean sprouts, stir-fried chrysanthemum greens. Friday: Dried bamboo shoots fried shredded pork, bean starch sheet with white fish head, vegetarian oil tofu soup, braised cabbage. Saturday: Curry beef slices, small shrimp fried with scrambled eggs, pickled vegetables fried with yam, braised vegetarian assorted delicacies. Sunday: Stewed pickled fresh meat, pan-fried ribbonfish, stir-fried pea sprouts, mung bean sprouts.

Spring and Autumn

### The Dime Panic

(1) Huang Ziqiang

The panic over fen coins has not been completely resolved yet, but a dime coin panic has now broken out. Buying up copper yuan and fen coins has high profits, so short-sighted businessmen are acting as accomplices, causing temporary chaos in the "isolated island." The current dime panic is certainly caused by more than just this simple reason, but profiting from it and disrupting the market is even worse than during the fen coin panic.

What makes people feel most inconvenience are the small trades at the vegetable market, cigarette exchange shops and medical garden. In the absence of loose fen coins to make change, you have to purchase at least a dime for vegetables, this invisibly raises the cost of living, which makes the lives of ordinary people even harder. But now, it’s even impossible to make sales at the vegetable market. With larger transactions on the fishy stalls, fishmongers have already exchanged some dime coins to maintain business, but it still trades at different rates from 93 cents to 97 cents per yuan. Other small vegetable stalls, because they do not have more capital to exchange dime coins in advance, they can only shake their heads at the banknotes handed up by customers, and these peddlers who get small profits are the ones who suffer the most.

The "exquisite" nature of Shanghai's cigarette exchange shops is well known. When the Central Mint released fen coin notes, the largest discount for one yuan was a dime. Now, purchases of less than five dimes will be discounted by at least five to seven cents. If the trade is only a few cents to a dime, then they rudely refuse, because the items sold in the cigarette exchange shops are daily necessities that are indispensable for home living, and they are not afraid of losing business.

Rickshaw pullers are also the most affected class. Because the cost of living has increased, ordinary rickshaw customers have switched to taking the tram, but now the tram ticket sellers are loudly shouting, "Please do not board if you do not have dime coins," and the customers who take rickshaws have naturally decreased even more.

As for all snack and food shops, they have all posted signs at the entrance saying, "A discount of three cents for purchases under five dimes." According to them, they have to pay a discount of five to seven cents when they exchange them. However, the wool comes from the sheep, and the general customer is the one who ultimately suffers the loss.

Therefore, the impact of the dime coin panic is even greater than that of the fen coin panic, because the poorest citizens are the most exploited.

(2) Simon

… However, some businessmen still have a lot of dime coins in their hands, but they have nowhere to spend them. The day before yesterday, I asked for a load of coal balls and took out a ten-yuan banknote, and the coal ball shop owner asked me to pay with two yuan worth of dime coins, which I welcomed. According to him, most of the retail business done at the coal ball shop is mostly one or two dimes, so they have accumulated a lot of dime coins and welcome me to go down and ask them to exchange them. It can be seen that dime coins are not lacking, but it is just that supply and demand is inappropriate, with some places having too much and some places having too little. (Editor: Perhaps this coal ball shop owner's information is not well-informed, and he is probably regretting the invisible loss of the discount on these two yuan of dime coins now.)

It is said that there are many reasons why these dime coins are lacking: some of the tattered dime coins have been recovered, and the new issuance amount is currently not as much as the old ones; the number of dime coins flowing into the occupied areas is very high; and some people are also buying them up, deliberately disrupting the market, hoping that the larger discounts can make money, which is also a major reason. If this is true, then we can only hope that the financial sector can quickly find appropriate countermeasures to reduce the inconvenience of shopping for citizens.

### The Elimination of Corporal Punishment and the Urgent Abolition of the Expulsion System

— Liu Zi

I happened to be talking with a few friends about the issue of schools expelling students. Before the war, many of the more famous secondary and higher schools had vigorously implemented this system, which aroused discussion among people in society about this issue. After the war, in Shanghai, which had become an isolated island, this issue was put aside. Although a certain newspaper had once discussed it some time ago, it still seemed to be inconclusive. Recently, several well-known schools, in order to rectify discipline, still plan to vigorously implement the expulsion system. Therefore, we believe that this is an educational problem that urgently needs to be resolved and cannot be ignored.

My personal opinion is that this system is absolutely contrary to educational principles. The expulsion of students by ordinary schools is nothing more than poor grades and bad conduct. I believe that schools can replace the former with grade retention, so why make them feel the pain of dropping out of school? I also think the latter is unreasonable. Just think, the student's behavior is base, which is the failure of education, and educators and school leaders should blame themselves; education is designed to improve students' academic performance and cultivate moral character, which is also the greatest mission that educators should assume. Because a bad student, are we to let him remain bad forever? Or push the responsibility onto others? If it is because of cherishing one's own or one's school's reputation, and heartlessly watching these fallen students continue to fall, not only not helping them, but kicking them when they're down, this is certainly not right; if it is said that it is to prevent a few bad apples from spoiling the whole bunch, this statement is also too narrow. Just think: why not find a way to make these few inferior students influenced by the majority of good students, but instead fearing that a few will harm the many, this is not the tone that educators should have, right? In the past, there was unanimous opposition to corporal punishment, believing that inflicting physical punishment on students was too contrary to educational principles. I think that expelling students is even more unreasonable than corporal punishment, because once students are expelled, they are simply deprived of the opportunity to correct their mistakes and start anew.

Cao Souyi, the former principal of Zhenjiang Normal School of Jiangsu Province, firmly opposed the expulsion system. He believed that students should be patiently guided and led to self-awareness and self-renewal, and the results were quite effective. At that time, the school had very good discipline. This is one example. Therefore, I feel that the expulsion system for students in schools should be abolished as soon as possible, and it should be included in the ranks of elimination along with the corporal punishment system of the past.

### The Sky Clears After the Rain

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 18: Talking about Economic Prosperity and Old Markets; Describing Marital Plunder and Tracing Back Customs

From Suzhou to Shanghai, it is still the section with the most passengers, so the Suzhou station often prepares one or two carriages there depending on the number of passengers. As long as the train comes, hook it on the back, and it can depart. Wu Junsu often travels between Shanghai and Suzhou, and knows this rule, so he leads them straight to the reserved carriage. At this moment, the train has assigned seating, and the six of them bought tickets together in one place, all with consecutive numbers, so they are naturally sitting together. Because there are more people, it feels even more interesting. After a while, the seats in this reserved carriage are also full. The train also enters the station, hooks up their reserved carriage, and departs. They talk and chat in the carriage, and soon they talk about the He sisters opening a silk weaving factory in Freedom Village. Shao Huihua strongly agrees, saying: "That's right! Why does everyone want to squeeze into Shanghai to open factories? I remember that in 1939 and 1940, it was during the Sino-Japanese War, and Shanghai still had concessions at that time. It was said that the two concessions had a total population of 4.5 million. I was still young at that time. We originally lived in Beiping, but later we fled to Shanghai. When we arrived in Shanghai, the first hardship was that we couldn't find a house. We had to stay in a hotel while looking for a house. Finally, a relative introduced us to a three-story small Western-style building, saying that the landlord was going to Kunming and was willing to lease the house to someone else. My mother contacted them, and the rent, which was usually 65 yuan per month, had now risen to 115 yuan. But we didn't care about that. No matter what, it was still cheaper than staying in a hotel. But when we asked about the key money, we were shocked. They wanted 3,000 yuan. What did 3,000 yuan get us? A telephone, a few electric lights, and a few broken tables. That's all. Later, we found out that it wasn't that the landlord was going to Kunming. He had simply leased it from someone else. However, his key money was much cheaper than the current price. He leased it for less than 1,000 yuan. At most, he paid two months' rent and earned more than 2,000 yuan. He took this opportunity to do business. At that time, during the national crisis, many people took this opportunity to make a fortune, which was called "profiteering from the national crisis." This was also one of them." Wu Junsu is the most impatient person, so he asks: "What happened later? Did you lease a house? We all experienced that kind of refugee era. Maybe the He sisters went abroad from a young age and didn't experience it. When my father talked about this era with me, he said it was a great era. Because at this time, the European War broke out again, and the whole world was in turmoil." (207)
