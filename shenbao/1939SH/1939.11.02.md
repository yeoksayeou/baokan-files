Chongqing: According to news from here today, Japanese troops in central and southern Hebei, in an attempt to flood guerrillas hiding in sorghum fields, have destroyed all the river dikes, causing up to five million Chinese farmers to be displaced by the floods.

### Never Expecting Peace, China is Determined to Continue the War; No Matter How the International Situation Changes, China is Determined to Defend to the End and Resist Aggression

Chongqing: According to well-informed Chinese sources in Chongqing, the rumor spread in London that there is a possibility of imminent peace in the Far East is firmly denied. It is said that there is absolutely no sign of expecting peace in Chongqing, whether in the government or among the people. Chinese leaders who recently returned to Chongqing after inspecting the front lines said that no matter what changes occur in the international situation, the Chinese army on the battlefield will be able to defend its territory. This strength is beyond the imagination of the people of Chongqing. (1st Reuters dispatch)

Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma today firmly denied rumors of peace negotiations between Tokyo and Chongqing. It is said that such rumors are not at all accurate. When a certain foreign reporter asked about this matter, Suma replied that he was quite surprised to hear the spread of such "completely unfounded" rumors. The Japanese government's statement that it will not negotiate with the Chiang Kai-shek government is still valid, and the Japanese government has repeatedly announced that it will fully support the new "central government" of China, which will soon be established, with Wang Jingwei as the central figure. When the spokesman mentioned the possible readjustment of British-Japanese and American-Japanese relations, he firmly stated that the Japanese government has no intention of engaging in formal or informal negotiations with Britain and the United States for the time being. When a reporter asked whether the Japanese government intends to suspend talks with these two countries pending the establishment of the new "central government" of China, the spokesman said that the question of suspension or termination does not arise, because "the Japanese government has never had the intention of starting negotiations with Britain and the United States to resolve the outstanding issues." All the reports in the newspapers are nothing more than speculation and conjecture. (1st Reuters dispatch)

### The Anti-British Movement in North China Has Been Ordered to Stop by the Japanese; Anti-British Slogans and Banners Will Be Removed Soon; All Parties in Chongqing Are Closely Watching This Move

Beiping: According to well-informed Chinese sources in political circles, the Japanese authorities have ordered the cessation of the anti-British movement in North China. This statement remains to be verified, but well-informed sources firmly claim that the Chinese police have been ordered to destroy the anti-British flags hanging in the streets, the anti-British slogans on the walls, and tear down the anti-British posters and leaflets within a few days, and will withdraw the patrol teams in front of the British residences. This situation may indicate that the Japanese side has changed its policy and will develop friendship with democratic countries and gradually distance itself from totalitarian countries. (1st Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing: News from Beiping says that the Japanese authorities are now stopping the anti-British movement in North China. All circles of Chinese people here are paying close attention to this matter. Chongqing is now waiting for evidence to prove or deny the Japanese side's sudden change of policy. The opinion of all circles of Chinese people is that if this is true, it should be paid great attention. Although China does not want the anti-British movement to continue, it is very willing to know the reasons behind Japan's sudden change of policy towards Britain. They want to know whether this change is due to Britain's making important concessions to Japan that are unfavorable to China. It is also reported that Tokyo news said that Japan decided to establish a new central government of China, and then start negotiations with the United States and Britain. The peace conditions of Japan published in the Asahi Shimbun are also closely concerned by all circles of Chinese people here. However, the masses generally believe that at present, neither the National Government nor the Chinese people are willing to make peace with Japan. (1st Reuters dispatch)

Editorial

### Prospects for Shanghai Industry and Commerce

The period of "Shidi Biqi," as commonly referred to in Shanghai's commercial practices, has passed peacefully, which undoubtedly indicates that Shanghai's industries and commerce are still quite stable. More than two years have passed since the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle. Chinese merchants and civilians have been able to resume various production activities in the narrow concession area under special circumstances, allowing millions of Chinese and foreign residents to continue their peaceful lives and preserve a large part of their livelihood under the good guidance of the concession authorities and leaders of the industrial and commercial sectors. This spirit of enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens is indeed worthy of considerable admiration.

However, Shanghai's industrial and commercial activities in the past two years have been filled with an atmosphere of speculative boom. In essence, they have not exerted normal functions due to the efforts of the industrial and commercial sectors. The main reasons are the fluctuations in the exchange rate and the soaring prices caused by various environmental limitations in Shanghai itself, which have led to the large-scale profiteering of those who hoard Chinese and foreign goods. As a result, the public believes that as long as they engage in industrial and commercial activities, they can obtain huge profits. Therefore, newly established stores and factories have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, and now there is an inevitable trend of being difficult to reverse. The fact that the recent "Shidi Biqi" was able to pass peacefully is not due to the inherent stability of the industrial and commercial sectors themselves; it must be acknowledged that the measures of the National Government have been effective. The discount and loan committee formed by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China has done its best to handle discount mortgages and other loans, directly adjusting interbank finance, and indirectly providing relief to industries and commerce. This is something that Shanghai industrial and commercial operators should clearly recognize.

Judging from the current situation in Shanghai, it is neither an appropriate time to revive normal industries and commerce, nor is it actually possible to realize such an attempt. After becoming an isolated island, Shanghai has to bear an illegal and heavy tax burden for both the export and import of goods. Industrial and commercial operators can still obtain considerable profits from their own businesses, but the loss to the country's financial economy is particularly large. Moreover, whether the island's industries and commerce can be freely operated in the future will become an increasingly serious problem. Not to mention the operations of Chinese merchants and civilians, even the industrial and commercial enterprises of European and American merchants are suffering the same fate. The goods needed by Shanghai that are imported from the occupied areas have almost lost their freedom of transportation and sales. A few days ago, the eggs purchased by British and American commercial firms were forcibly plundered by people in the concession. Earlier, the labor unrest in British factories in Pudong and other places was obviously under the pressure and manipulation of violence. As for the goods transported to Shanghai from the interior, the decree on foreign exchange settlement for the export of domestic goods naturally has a considerable impact on the goods transported to Shanghai. As for the goods exported from Shanghai, they have been completely squeezed out by Japanese goods in the occupied areas. In the interior, in order to prevent counterfeit domestic goods, the National Government has recently banned the import of all goods manufactured in Shanghai, except for raw materials. As for exports to foreign countries, since the outbreak of the European war, not only has the source of export goods become a problem, but transportation has also become difficult. Shanghai's industries and commerce originally depended on entrepot trade for normal development, but now they can only focus on local consumption and the activities of囤戶.

The soaring prices have encouraged Shanghai's industrial and commercial activities in the past, but in the future, they will inevitably become an obstacle to industrial and commercial activities. Because if Shanghai's industries and commerce only target the local area, Shanghai's consumption capacity is very limited. The current prices can be said to have reached a considerable height. If they continue to rise continuously, consumers may have no other choice but to tighten their purchasing power to achieve a balance with the soaring prices. Moreover, the soaring prices in the speculative boom are a general increase in the prices of all kinds of goods. As a result, the expenditure also increases relatively with the income. Then, industrial and commercial operators may not be able to obtain huge profits due to the reduction of transactions and the increase of various expenditures, which poses a danger of their own collapse.

Judging from the above situation, Shanghai's industries and commerce have entered an extremely dangerous stage. For the sake of social security and for the sake of the industries and commerce themselves, we cannot but ask industries and commerce to avoid unfortunate events in advance. First, all speculative activities should be terminated immediately to stabilize the development of the business. Efforts should be made to lower prices as much as possible, or at least prevent them from rising further. The best way is to reduce the scope of industries and commerce so as to reduce their own risks and also reduce part of the country's losses. If they can transfer their funds to the interior with the perseverance and spirit of operating industries in this port, it will be of greater assistance to the country. In short, Shanghai's industries and commerce can only seek stability now, not development, because the current Shanghai can only be regarded as a temporary place for funds to escape disaster, and cannot be regarded as the center for the development of industrial and commercial enterprises.

### Finland Issues Statement Abroad: Negotiations with the Soviet Union Likely to be Delayed; Hopes the Soviet Union Respects Treaty Obligations; Finnish Delegation Departs for Moscow

Helsinki, Finland: Following the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, the Finnish Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union has already raised various issues and declared that the Soviet government is willing to discuss them with the Finnish government. As the Finnish plenipotentiary representatives have just departed for Moscow to deliver a response to the Soviet government, Molotov has openly expressed his views, creating a novel situation. Previous discussions between Finland and the Soviet Union were confidential. Although Finland's firm pursuit of a neutral policy has made negotiations difficult, it still maintains an independent stance, free from the oppression and influence of any foreign country, and strives to find solutions to various issues. In addition, Finland is willing to guarantee the safety of the Soviet Leningrad region, but does not want its own safety to be jeopardized. It is still difficult to know to what extent Finland's position will be affected by Molotov's speech, but it can be asserted that negotiations will be delayed as a result. In essence, Molotov stated that the Soviet Union has the right to take all necessary measures to ensure security in the Gulf of Finland and near the border of Leningrad, and also has this obligation. The Finnish Foreign Ministry hereby declares that the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression treaty with Finland in 1932, promising to respect the existing border and resolve all disputes peacefully. This treaty is valid until 1945, and it is hoped that the Soviet Union will respect it." (Havas Agency dispatch, 1st)

Stockholm: A Finnish dispatch from a certain newspaper here states that the Finnish delegation led by Paasikivi departed for Moscow last night to continue Finnish-Soviet negotiations, carrying a detailed answer to be submitted to Soviet dictator Stalin. This new proposal represents the unanimous view of the Finnish cabinet and parliament, including the opposition parties. Although its content is currently kept secret, it is said that the proposal is a written expression of the extent of Finland's preparedness, but does not refuse further discussion on the details. The Finns believe that the new proposal will satisfy the Soviet Union, and the Finns intend to accommodate the interests of the Soviet Union with all possible concessions. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

Helsinki, Finland: The Finnish delegation departed for Moscow yesterday, carrying the Finnish government's final proposal. The full text is ten pages long and was drafted and translated into Russian in the last three days, so the delegation was delayed until yesterday. The content of the proposal is unknown to the outside world. According to well-informed sources, Finland is prepared to make concessions to the Soviet Union in order to maintain its neutral status. The Finnish government generally believes that Finnish-Soviet negotiations may not be concluded before the Soviet October Revolution anniversary on November 6. It is widely believed that Finland is prepared to make concessions to the Soviet Union, perhaps in the range of allowing the Soviet Union to fortify four places: Hogland Island, Seskär, Lavansaari, and Tytärsaari. It is noted that the above-mentioned places are the main routes from Helsinki, the capital of Finland, to Kronstadt, Soviet Union. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 1st)

Moscow: At his speech to the Supreme Soviet, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov yesterday expressed the Soviet Union's determination to resolve the Finnish issue, determined to make Finland comply with the demands raised by the Soviet Union. "If Finland continues to be stubborn, it will become an obstacle to peace." At the same time, news came from Helsinki, Finland, that the Finnish authorities were greatly surprised by this move by the Soviet Union. The Soviet government had previously agreed to wait for the final reply from the Finnish government, which was to be delivered to Moscow today. The Finnish General Staff notified the Finnish cabinet last night that the Soviet Union's demands would be a very serious issue, as they included Finland's only eastern defense line, the so-called "Mannerheim Line." The government also urgently telegraphed the Finnish delegation en route to the Soviet Union, instructing them to call Helsinki from the Soviet border for instructions. Finland attaches particular importance to the points in the Soviet Union's demands concerning Hanko Peninsula, Jägala Island, and the islands in the Gulf of Finland. Soviet government officials held meetings late last night to discuss response measures. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)

### Soviet Military Delegation Arrives in Lithuania

Kaunas, Lithuania: More than one hundred Soviet military officers have recently arrived here to arrange the deployment locations for Soviet troops as stipulated in the Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty, so that Soviet troops can be sent to garrison. Barracks in various parts of Lithuania will be emptied on November 1 for acceptance by Soviet troops. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 1st)

Kaunas, Lithuania: An official communiqué was recently released stating that all units of the Lithuanian armed forces sent to the Vilnius region have arrived at their destination. (Havas Agency dispatch, 1st)

Brussels, Belgium: The 20th Century newspaper recently reported that, according to reliable sources, goods purchased by Germany and the Soviet Union from each other are being transshipped through Lithuania. (Havas Agency dispatch, 1st)

Kaunas: Regarding the "London Times" report that the number of Soviet troops stationed in Lithuania will increase to tens of thousands, the official authorities here have issued a clarification denying this, denouncing the British newspaper's report as fabricated out of thin air. However, the military delegations of the Soviet Union and Lithuania have a tacit understanding to temporarily keep the contents of the Soviet-Lithuanian agreement secret. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 1st)

### Thorough Reorganization of the Italian Cabinet; Traditional Policies Unchanged; Younger Faction Gains Power; Observing the Situation with a Calm and Cautious Eye

London: German radio announced the news of the changes in the Italian cabinet today without adding any criticism, only stating that Italian sources said that this change would not affect the Italian Prime Minister's traditional policies. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

Milan: After the reorganization of the Italian cabinet, the official authorities have not made any comments, but well-informed sources in the local Fascist Party believe that Mussolini's personal position and the influence of the activist faction within the Fascist Party have been strengthened. They pointed out that the new cabinet members are all close confidants of Mussolini and are prepared to absolutely abide by Mussolini's policies. These are young people who have struggled for many years in the Fascist Party, and the Italian government has been controlled by the activist faction. If Mussolini needs to make new decisions on foreign policy, it is also possible to obtain appropriate solutions. They believe that the appointment of General Graziani as Chief of the Army Staff is a symbol of this trend, as Graziani is a highly respected military leader, and his achievements in Libya and Abyssinia have deeply impressed the Italian people. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 31st)

London: Although Rome and Berlin believe that many important changes in the Italian cabinet are merely "a change of guards," a Dutch newspaper today asked, "Is Mussolini preparing for a comprehensive change?" According to a dispatch from Rome from the Dutch "Telegraaf," the changes in the Italian cabinet are insignificant, as Ciano remains Foreign Minister, and Mussolini will continue to direct everything. Both Rome and Berlin said that the Italian Prime Minister often advocates changing cabinet members within a certain period of time in order to provide new contributions. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

Rome: After Prime Minister Mussolini abruptly reorganized the cabinet today, people from all walks of life, including certain cabinet members, expressed surprise. Foreign observers are eager to understand the true significance of this move, but opinions are extremely divided. Some say that it is the Prime Minister's consistent policy to change the highest authorities of the Fascist regime from time to time, and this matter is not unusual. However, others say that this move has political significance. Cultural and Propaganda Minister Alfieri and Army Undersecretary and Army Chief of Staff General Pariani were originally the people who handled the signing of various agreements between Germany and Italy, such as the German-Italian news agreement and military cooperation methods. They both maintained close contacts with the German authorities, and General Pariani often held talks with German military leaders. The dismissal of these two people proves that the Prime Minister intends to appoint new cabinet members who are relatively distant from Germany. Although Foreign Minister Ciano remains in his position, the rapprochement between Germany and Italy is not something that Ciano alone can be held responsible for. Moreover, since the establishment of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Ciano has always advocated maintaining complete "neutrality" and believes that Italy should observe the situation with a calm and cautious eye before making major decisions.

### Balkan Organization: Neutral Bloc; Resisting German and Soviet Advances; Plans Gradually Matured

London: The Foreign Office announced last night that the plan for Italy to participate in signing a Balkan Pact is about to mature, with the aim of resisting the advances of the Soviet Union and Germany. Romania appears to be Italy's main ally in promoting this plan. The Romanian government has summoned its ambassadors to Turkey and Yugoslavia back to Bucharest for meetings, as Turkey and Yugoslavia agree to expand the Balkan Pact but want to know all the details. The United Kingdom is taking a reserved attitude towards this development, while France has expressed sympathy. However, those close to the British government welcome the news that Italy and Greece are about to sign a non-aggression pact. Sources in London claim that Rome and Athens have decided to reaffirm the non-aggression and friendship treaty signed in 1928. It is believed here that this development is another factor in stabilizing the situation in the Balkans. Well-informed sources here claim that after most of the diplomatic representatives in the Balkans attended two banquets here, the Balkan Conference will be held within two weeks.

### Molotov Elaborates on Soviet Foreign Policy at the Supreme Soviet; Blames Britain and France for Continuing a Meaningless War; Maintains Neutrality and is Willing to Make the Greatest Efforts for Peace

Moscow: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held a special meeting today. Stalin, Molotov, and other members of the Presidium of the People's Commissars sat on the rostrum. British Ambassador Seeds and others listened in the diplomatic gallery, and the leader of the German commercial delegation stationed in Moscow was also present. Former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov sat in the deputies' seats, next to Dimitrov, the current Secretary-General of the Comintern. Various deputies took their seats by resolution. The last to be seated were the recently elected representatives of the four Ukrainian and West Belarusian regions. The meeting was colorful, with old women in white headscarves, village girls in brightly colored clothes, and men in disheveled attire. When the meeting began, a film camera was placed on the rostrum.

Foreign Minister Molotov delivered the opening speech, heavily criticizing Britain and France for refusing to negotiate peace with Germany, saying that "waging a war to destroy Hitlerism in the name of fighting for democracy is not only meaningless but also a crime. The reason why Britain and France are determined to continue the war is that Germany will demand colonies, and Britain will lose its world supremacy. Everyone knows that restoring the old Poland is no longer a problem, so it is absurd to continue the current war under the banner of restoring Poland. The Soviet Union's future goals are: (1) freedom of action in international events, (2) continuation of the policy of neutrality, and (3) cessation of war. Soviet-Japanese commercial negotiations may begin soon, but it is not yet clear to what extent Japan wants to improve Soviet-Japanese relations and when it can be realized." (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

Moscow: Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, delivered a report at the Fifth Extraordinary Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union today. His words said: "Comrade deputies, in the past two months, the international situation has undergone great changes, affecting Europe and other countries. The most important events that we must mention here include three items:

### German-Soviet Reconciliation and the Collapse of Poland: Fundamental Changes in the International Situation

"First, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany has changed. Since the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on August 23, the abnormal relationship between the two countries for many years has been terminated. The ill will that was fostered by certain European countries has been transformed into cordial friendship. The German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Border Demarcation signed in Moscow on September 29 further promoted this good neighborly relationship. This fundamental change in the relationship between the two largest countries in Europe cannot but have a significant impact on the entire international situation, and everything that has happened during this period has confirmed the estimation of the political significance of the German-Soviet reconciliation at the last plenary session of the Supreme Soviet, which was completely correct.

Second, Poland has been defeated, and its country has collapsed. In the past, the Polish ruling class repeatedly boasted of the "stability" of its country and the "strength" of its army. However, this product of the Treaty of Versailles, a country that lived by oppressing non-Polish minorities, immediately disappeared without a trace after being successively attacked by the German army and the Red Army. Its traditional policy of unscrupulous wandering between the Soviet Union and Germany, provoking ill will between the two countries, has completely failed.

Third, we must admit that the outbreak of war in Europe has fundamentally changed the entire international situation. This war began with the German-Polish War and evolved into a war between Germany and Britain and France. The German-Polish War ended quickly due to the bankruptcy of the Polish rulers. The guarantees of Britain and France to Poland did not help Poland at all. In fact, no one knows what this kind of "guarantee" is. As for the war between Germany and Britain and France, it is currently in its initial stage and has not yet fully developed. But we can assert that this kind of war will inevitably cause fundamental changes to Europe and the world.

### Three Items on the Agenda of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union

Moscow: The Fifth Extraordinary Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened today in the Kremlin. The joint meeting of the Federal and National Councils was held that evening, chaired by Andrei Andreyev, Chairman of the Federal Council. Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Zhdanov, Khrushchev, Shvernik, and Beria took their seats, and the entire venue erupted in cheers. The delegation of representatives from the National Assembly of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus attending the plenary session was warmly welcomed by all the deputies. The joint meeting of the two councils passed the following agenda for this extraordinary plenary session: (1) Report on the government's foreign policy; (2) Declaration by the delegation of representatives from the National Assembly of Western Ukraine; (3) Declaration by the delegation of representatives from the National Assembly of Western Belarus.

After the resolution that all items on the agenda would be discussed at the joint meeting of the two councils, Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, began to report on the first item. (TASS dispatch, 31st)

### Old Formulas No Longer Apply; Ideas Cannot Be Destroyed by Force

serious mistakes occurred when judging the situation. For example, in the past few months, terms such as "aggression" and "aggressor" have acquired new concrete definitions and meanings. We obviously cannot continue to apply such terms with the meaning they had three or four months ago. As far as the European powers are concerned, Germany is now striving to end the war quickly and seek peace, while Britain and France, who yesterday still condemned aggression, are now advocating continuing the war and opposing peace. The British and French governments' obligations to Poland are clearly insufficient as a reason for this new position. Everyone knows that restoring the old Poland is no longer a problem, so it is inappropriate to continue the war for the reason of restoring Poland. The British and French governments also know this truth, but they are still unwilling to stop the war and make peace, and are looking for new excuses to continue the war against Germany. Recently, the British and French ruling classes have attempted to present themselves as defenders of democratic rights and opponents of Hitlerism. The British government has even declared that its purpose in waging war against Germany is only "to overthrow Hitlerism." The pro-war factions in Britain and France have clearly declared a war of an "ideological" nature against Germany, similar to the religious wars of ancient times. In the past, this kind of war of excluding dissidents was once popular, and the result was the extreme suffering of the people and the economic and cultural bankruptcy and degradation of various nations. This kind of war is a medieval war. Do the British and French ruling classes want us to return to the Middle Ages, to the superstitions and cultural degradation of religious wars? This kind of "ideological" war has now broken out, its scope is extremely broad, and its threat to the people of Europe and the world is extremely serious. But this war is completely unreasonable. People can accept or reject the ideas of Hitlerism, just as they do with any ideas. This is a matter of each person's political position. But everyone knows that ideas cannot be destroyed by force or eliminated by war. Therefore, it is not only meaningless but also a crime to carry out a war to "destroy Hitlerism" under the guise of fighting for "democracy." Moreover, how can the French government's dissolution of the Communist Party, the arrest of Communist deputies in the National Assembly, or the British government's restrictions on political freedom and oppression of the Indian people be called wars to defend democracy?

### Maintaining Democracy as a Shield; Britain and France Are Actually Fighting for Hegemony

"From this point of view, the purpose of the current European war is definitely not as announced in the official declarations of Britain and France. It is definitely not to obtain democracy, but there is something else that these gentlemen are unwilling to declare frankly. The war between Britain and France against Germany is neither because Britain and France have sworn to restore Poland, nor to maintain democracy. The British and French ruling classes have their own motives for this war. The motive is also unrelated to ideology, but is in the material interests of their vast colonial empires. The British Empire itself has a population of only 47 million, but owns colonies with a population of 480 million. The French colonial empire itself has only 42 million people, while the colonies have a population of 70 million. Britain and France's ability to exploit tens of thousands of people with such vast colonies is the foundation of their world hegemony. However, Germany's national strength has been increasing in recent years due to the collapse of the Treaty of Versailles, and it has been thinking about getting involved in these colonies. This is the basic reason for the war between Britain and France against Germany. The British and French ruling classes are determined to wage war against Germany because they fear losing world hegemony.

"As mentioned above, the imperialist nature of this decisive war is obvious. Anyone who faces reality cannot deny this point. And it is even clearer who benefits from this kind of war to seize world hegemony. It is definitely not in the interests of the working class. For the working class, this war only brings sacrifice and suffering. Therefore, the meaning of terms such as "aggression" and "aggressor" has recently changed. Everyone should be able to judge for themselves. Everyone should be able to understand that if these terms are still applied with the old meaning before the political relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany changed and the European imperialist war broke out, the result will inevitably cause confusion in people's hearts and lead to wrong conclusions. In order to avoid this, we cannot adopt an uncritical attitude towards the old terms, because they do not apply to the new international situation.

### Continuing to Adopt Neutrality; Helping Germany to Achieve Peace

"The above is a summary of recent international events. Below, I will outline the changes in the Soviet Union's own international position. These changes are very significant. We will only point out the most important points. Because of the consistent implementation of a peaceful foreign policy, our country's international position has been greatly enhanced. I mentioned earlier that our country's relations with Germany have been fundamentally improved. The relations between the two countries are developing along the lines of friendship, good neighborliness, and practical cooperation, and politically assisting Germany's peace movement. The German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact stipulates that our country should maintain neutrality when Germany is at war. We have consistently implemented this line, and our army's entry into the former Polish territory on September 17 is not in conflict with this line. Moreover, our government issued a notification to all countries with diplomatic relations on the same day, stating that the Soviet Union will continue to adopt a neutral policy in its relations with all these countries. Our army's entry into Polish territory was after the collapse of the Polish state. Because Poland has collapsed, we encountered problems related to our national security. We certainly cannot remain neutral and indifferent. Our Ukrainian and Belarusian compatriots in the west were left to fate due to the collapse of Poland. Our government cannot sit idly by. "Subsequent events have confirmed that the foundation of the new relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany is extremely solid. Although the major issue of dividing the scope of interests between the two countries arose after the Red Army entered Poland, this issue was quickly resolved by mutual agreement between the two sides. After the signing of the German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Border Demarcation at the end of September, the relationship between the two countries was further consolidated.

"In the past twenty years, the relationship between Germany and the Western European bourgeois countries has been mainly dominated by Germany's efforts to break free from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles. The creators of this treaty were Britain and France, and the United States also participated. This is the distant cause of the outbreak of the European war today. The foundation of the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany is completely different. The Soviet Union has no interest in maintaining the post-war Versailles system. We have consistently advocated that a strong Germany is a necessary condition for lasting peace in Europe. It is ridiculous to think that Germany can be destroyed so that it is not recorded in the books. The powers that dream this foolish dream have clearly forgotten the regrettable experience of Versailles, do not recognize the increasing national strength of Germany, and do not know that the attempt to reproduce Versailles in the current international situation, which is different from that in 1914, will result in them eating their own fruit. "We have consistently worked hard to improve relations with Germany and welcome Germany's similar efforts. Now this relationship has been established on the basis of friendship and good neighborliness. We are willing to support Germany's efforts to seek peace, and at the same time, we are willing to cooperate in developing economic relations between the two countries so that both sides benefit. Since the improvement of the political relationship between the two countries, the economic relationship has also greatly improved. The negotiations recently conducted by the German delegation in Moscow and the current negotiations conducted by our delegation in Germany are establishing a broad foundation for the development of Soviet-German trade.

### Occupying Polish Territory: Exaggerated Military Victory

"I will continue to discuss everything about our army entering the former Polish territory. The process of this event need not be detailed, as you have already seen it in the newspapers. I will only mention the most important points. When Poland disintegrated, our government had to assist our Ukrainian and Belarusian compatriots in the west. This goes without saying. After the Red Army entered the two regions, it was warmly welcomed by the people. They recognized our army as liberators who helped them get rid of the shackles of Polish gentry, landlords, and capitalists. In some areas, the Red Army had major battles with the Polish army, resulting in considerable casualties. The numbers are as follows: 'On the Belarusian front, a total of 246 Red Army officers and soldiers were killed and 503 were wounded, totaling 749 casualties. On the Ukrainian front, 491 officers and soldiers were killed and 1,359 were wounded, totaling 1,850 casualties. In both regions, a total of 737 were killed and 1,862 were wounded, totaling 2,599 casualties. Our army seized war trophies in Poland, including over 900 cannons, over 10,000 machine guns, over 300,000 rifles, over 150 million rounds of rifle ammunition, over 1 million artillery shells, and 300 aircraft. The territory incorporated into the Soviet Union is equal in area to a major European country, including 108,000 square kilometers of Western Belarus, with a population of 4.8 million, and 88,000 square kilometers of Western Ukraine, with a population of 8 million. The total area of the two regions is 196,000 square kilometers, with a population of 13 million, including over 7 million Ukrainians, over 3 million Belarusians, over 1 million Poles, and over 1 million Jews.

"The political significance of the above events is extremely significant. Reports from Western Ukraine and Western Belarus state that the people unanimously and enthusiastically welcomed national liberation and the victory of the Soviet system. The recent universal, direct, equal, and secret ballot elections for the National Assembly, the first in the history of these two regions, proved that nine-tenths of their people had long wished to join the Soviet Union. The National Assemblies held in Lviv and Bialystok proved that all people's representatives were in complete agreement on all political issues.

### Commitment Not to Interfere in the Internal Affairs of the Three Baltic States

"I will further discuss our relations with the Baltic states. Significant changes have also taken place in this regard. In the past, our country's diplomatic relations with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were based on the peace treaties concluded with each of these countries in 1920. These treaties made them independent countries. Since then, the Soviet Union has pursued a friendly policy towards them. This is very different from the policies of Imperial Russia, which oppressed small and weak nations, forbidding them to have independent national and political development, causing them deep resentment. The past twenty years of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the three countries have created favorable conditions for further improvement of political and other relations. Therefore, as a result of recent negotiations in Moscow with representatives of the three countries, mutual assistance pacts have been concluded separately. These pacts have great political significance. Their principles are completely the same, all being for the mutual assistance of the contracting parties, including military assistance when the countries are attacked. "The three countries have a special geographical location and are the gateway to the Soviet Union in the Baltic Sea. After the signing of these pacts, the Soviet Union can establish naval bases and airfields in designated locations in Estonia and Latvia, and jointly defend the borders of Lithuania. These naval bases and airfields, and the assigned Red Army forces stationed there to protect them, will not only protect the borders of the Soviet Union, but also protect the Baltic states, which is also beneficial to the maintenance of peace and the interests of the people. Our negotiations with the three countries proved that both sides had mutual trust and understanding of the necessity of military guarantees for mutual interests, and demonstrated that both sides were willing to maintain peace and protect the safety of the people engaged in peaceful activities. It is precisely for this reason that the negotiations for these historically significant mutual assistance pacts were successful. "The meaning of these pacts is not for the Soviet Union to interfere in the internal affairs of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as falsely claimed by some foreign newspapers. On the contrary, each pact clearly states the inviolability of the sovereignty of the contracting countries and the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The pacts mutually respect each other's political, social, and economic systems, and their purpose is to enhance the peaceful, friendly, and cooperative relations between the peoples of both sides. We will strictly abide by each pact in accordance with the principle of reciprocity. We should declare that all slanders about the Sovietization of the Baltic states are the provocations of our common enemies and anti-Soviet elements. Since our country improved political relations with the three countries, we have also met their economic needs. Recently, we have also signed commercial treaties with them separately, and as a result, our trade with these countries will increase several times, with the possibility of further increases in the future. "At a time when all European countries, including neutral countries, are experiencing trade difficulties, the economic agreements signed between our country and the three Baltic states are of great importance to these countries. Therefore, the restoration of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania will accelerate the development of agriculture, industry, and transportation, and benefit the people of the neighboring Baltic countries.

The Soviet Union's policy toward small countries can be strongly illustrated by the agreement to return Vilnius to the Republic of Lithuania. As a result of the establishment of this agreement, the Lithuanian state, with a population of 2.5 million, has expanded its land, and the population has increased by 550,000. At the same time, Vilnius was also returned, and the city's population is several times larger than the current Lithuanian capital. The Soviet Union agreed to return Vilnius to Lithuania, not because the majority of the city's population is Lithuanian. In fact, the majority of the population of Vilnius is not Lithuanian. The Soviet side considered that the city, which was seized by Polish force, should still be a Lithuanian city. The city has close ties with Lithuania's past history and Lithuania's aspirations. Foreign newspapers have pointed out that this kind of fact that a large country voluntarily returns a large city to a small country has no precedent in world history. Therefore, the Soviet Union's move has fully demonstrated its goodwill.

### Special Relationship with Finland: Concerning National Security

Our relationship with Finland is very special. This is due to the strong influence of a third power in Finland. However, fair-minded people should recognize that the issue of Soviet security (especially Leningrad) was mentioned in the past in the Soviet-Finnish talks, and will be reviewed in the current Soviet-Finnish negotiations. In a certain sense, this relationship concerning Soviet security is extremely acute. Because Leningrad, in addition to Moscow, is the most important city in the Soviet Union, and the city is located only 32 kilometers from the Finnish border. In other words, the distance between Leningrad and the foreign border is so short that modern artillery can reach it. On the other hand, the sea route from Finland to Leningrad is also very close. Therefore, Finland's attitude toward the Soviet Union, whether it is friendly or hostile, is extremely important. Finland now owns the entire north shore of the Gulf of Finland and the islands in the middle of the Gulf of Finland.

In view of the above circumstances, and the current situation in Europe, Finland is expected to show the necessary understanding. What is the basis of Soviet-Finnish relations in the past few years? As you know, the basis of this relationship is the peace agreement established in 1920, which is similar in nature to the one we signed with other Baltic neighbors. The Soviet Union automatically guaranteed the independent survival of Finland. Undoubtedly, only the Soviet Union, which recognizes the principle of national freedom and development, can take such action. At the same time, only the Soviet government dares to tolerate Finland, which is maintaining its independence near the gateway to Leningrad. Regarding this point, it can be proved by the experience that Finland gained from the "Kerensky" and "Tsereteli" "democratic governments." As for the governments of Lvov and Milyukov, and the government of Imperial Russia, they are even more out of the question. There is no doubt that these important circumstances will become an excellent foundation for improving Soviet-Finnish relations. As for the concern for peace, Finland is no less than the Soviet Union. The recent Soviet-Finnish negotiations were initiated by us. What is the theme of the negotiations? The major powers in the center of Europe are brewing the most terrible war. In this international situation, the Soviet Union has no choice but to take strict measures to protect its security. Regarding this point, since the Gulf of Finland and the land are extremely close to Leningrad, the Soviet Union's special attention is also reasonable.

### Recognizing the Demands as Reasonable: Hoping for Finnish Understanding

The population of Leningrad has now increased to 1.35 million, which is almost equal to the entire population of Finland, which is 3.65 million. There is no need to further discuss the stories spread by foreign newspapers about the Soviet-Finnish negotiations.

## Page 6

Some newspapers even said that the Soviet Union was demanding the city of Vyborg and the northern part of Lake Ladoga, which is a pure lie. Another newspaper claimed that the Soviet Union was demanding that Finland cede the island of Älänsaari, which is also a pure fabrication. At the same time, there are even more rumors about the Soviet Union's demands on Sweden and Norway. The absurdity of these rumors is too great to be refuted. In fact, the proposals we have made to Finland are extremely fair, and these proposals are also the minimum measures to ensure Soviet security and maintain Soviet-Finnish relations. We have already begun negotiations with the representatives sent by Finland, including Paasikivi. We have suggested to them to sign a Soviet-Finnish mutual assistance pact, which is similar in nature to the mutual assistance agreements we have established with other Baltic countries. However, since the Finnish government stated that this agreement would affect its neutrality, we did not insist. We then proceeded to discuss the issue of Soviet security (especially Leningrad). We suggested establishing an agreement to move the Soviet-Finnish border in the Karelian Isthmus to a location 100 kilometers north of Leningrad. In exchange, we would transfer a part of Soviet Karelia to Finland. The area of Soviet Karelia is several times larger than the area ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union.

At the same time, we also suggested to Finland to establish an agreement stipulating that Finland would lease a small part of the Gulf of Finland to the Soviet Union for a fixed period of time, so that the Soviet Union could establish a naval base there. According to the Soviet-Estonian mutual assistance agreement, the Soviet Union has already established a naval base in the southern part of the Gulf of Finland (i.e., the Baltic Sea coast). The establishment of a naval base in the northern part of the Gulf of Finland will surely guarantee the entire Gulf of Finland, so that it will not be invaded by foreign enemies. We are convinced that the establishment of this naval base will benefit not only the Soviet Union but also Finland. As for our other suggestions, especially the suggestion to exchange certain islands in the Gulf of Finland and the Rybachiy Peninsula and the Sredny Peninsula for Soviet Karelia (the latter being several times larger in area than the former), the Finnish side has not objected. However, other disagreements have not yet been resolved. Although the Finnish side has now agreed to cede a part of the Karelian Isthmus, it is still of no avail. At the same time, we have taken new steps to find a solution. We have stated that if our main proposals are accepted by the Finnish side, we will no longer oppose the fortification of Älänsaari. We only put forward one condition, that the fortification of Älänsaari should be carried out by Finland itself, and no third country (including the Soviet Union) should participate. We further suggested that Finland request the removal of the defensive fortifications on the Soviet-Finnish border (in the Karelian Isthmus), and stated that this move would surely benefit the Finnish state.

At the same time, we also stated our hope for adding mutual assistance guarantee clauses to the Soviet-Finnish non-aggression treaty. Finally, the consolidation of Soviet-Finnish political relations will surely become the basis for the progress of economic relations between the two countries. From this point of view, we are prepared to seek a solution to all the points that we are concerned about with Finland. Therefore, we do not believe that the Finnish government will seek some excuse to hinder the establishment of the currently proposed agreement. This kind of action violates the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland, and the harm to Finland is also extremely great. We firmly believe that the Finnish leaders will recognize the necessity of consolidating the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland, and that the Finnish people will surely reject anti-Soviet forces and incitement.

### The United States Interferes: Mocking Its Meddlesomeness

"Regarding the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, the US President has now even intervened. This is inconsistent with the US policy of neutrality. On October 12, President Roosevelt sent a telegram to Kalinin, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, hoping that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland could be maintained and further developed. This telegram makes people believe that the relationship between the United States and the Philippines and Cuba is better than the relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland. In fact, the Philippines has requested independence but has not been granted, while Finland has long been granted freedom and independence. Comrade Kalinin immediately replied to Mr. Roosevelt, stating, "I respectfully request that your president pay attention to the fact that the Soviet Union recognized the political independence of Finland as early as December 31, 1917, and Finnish sovereignty was guaranteed in the peace agreement established between Russia and Finland on October 10, 1920. This move by the Soviet Union has explained the basic principles of the Soviet Union's relationship with Finland. The current negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland are based on these basic principles, and their sole purpose is to consolidate the relations between the two countries and strengthen mutual cooperation to jointly strive for the security of both countries." "Since the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has given such a clear reply, the Finnish government should accept our proposals. Our proposals are the minimum measures, and they will not only not harm the national interests of Finland, but will also enhance its security, so that the Finnish side can establish a stronger foundation for economic and political relations with us.

### Turkey Takes a Dangerous Path: Soon to Bite Off More Than It Can Chew

There is little to report regarding our negotiations with Turkey. There are many rumors abroad about these negotiations. Some parties even said that the Soviet Union was demanding that Turkey cede Ardahan and Kars. This kind of rumor is a pure fabrication. Others spread rumors that the Soviet Union was demanding to change the international treaties established in Montreux and demanding to obtain favorable positions in the straits. "This is also a fabricated lie. In fact, what was discussed was the issue of concluding a bilateral mutual assistance pact limited to the Black Sea and the straits area. The Soviet Union determined that First, the conclusion of this pact must not involve the Soviet Union in actions that would lead to armed conflict with Germany. Second, the Soviet Union wanted the following guarantee, that in the event of a threat of war, Turkey would not allow warships of non-Black Sea countries to pass through the Bosphorus Strait and enter the Black Sea. Turkey rejected these two conditions, and therefore the conclusion of the pact was impossible. "The Soviet-Turkish negotiations failed to sign a pact, but at least it was enough to clarify several political issues that we wanted to know. In the current international situation, it is particularly important to recognize the true face and policies of countries that have significant relations with us. Regarding Turkey's policy, we now fully understand many parts of it, not only because of the Moscow negotiations, but also because of the recent diplomatic actions of the Turkish government. The Turkish government's decision has linked the country's fate with the "certain warring parties" in the current war in Europe, that is, signing a mutual assistance pact with the United Kingdom and France, which have been at war with Germany for two months. In this way, Turkey has definitely abandoned its prudent policy of neutrality and joined the arena of right and wrong in the expanded European war. This move is naturally welcomed by the United Kingdom and France, who are striving to attract neutral countries to join their side as much as possible. Whether Turkey will regret this in the future, we will not predict. We must only remember the new factors in our neighbor's foreign policy and pay close attention to the development of events.

"Since Turkey has already taken a dangerous path to support a certain warring party to some extent, its government obviously knows the responsibilities it bears as a result. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is not like this, and as a result, it has had many successes in diplomacy in the past. In the future, the Soviet Union will stand aside and continue to consistently implement a policy of neutrality, not only not helping to expand the war, but also striving to support the movement to restore peace. We firmly believe that our country's consistent policy of peace will surely have good results in the future. We will also implement this policy in the Black Sea region, and we firmly believe that it will surely guarantee that it is normally adapted to the interests of the Soviet Union, as well as the interests of countries that are in harmony with the Soviet Union's wishes.

### Improving Soviet-Japanese Relations: Depending on Japan's Sincerity

"Next is our relationship with Japan. There has been some improvement in Soviet-Japanese relations recently. The signs of this improvement can be seen in the agreement to stop the conflict on the Mongolian-Manchurian border, which was signed in Moscow recently. From May to mid-September this year, Japanese-Manchurian forces and Soviet-Mongolian forces clashed in the Nomonhan area of the Manchurian-Mongolian border. During this period, various weapons, including aircraft and heavy artillery, were used. The fighting was sometimes extremely fierce. The cause of the conflict was Japan's attempt to seize a part of the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic and forcibly change the Manchurian-Mongolian border. This kind of unilateral action method will inevitably cause resolute resistance, and its application to the Soviet Union and its allies is completely useless, which has now been proved again. The unfortunate fate of Poland proves how unreliable the mutual assistance pacts signed by a certain powerful country in Europe are, but the facts that occurred on the Mongolian border prove how valuable the mutual assistance pacts signed by the Soviet Union are. "This conflict stopped after the Soviet-Japanese agreement was signed in Moscow on September 15. Border peace has been completely restored. In this way, the first step in the improvement of Soviet-Japanese relations has been taken. The second step is to organize a joint committee of Soviet-Mongolian and Japanese-Manchurian representatives to review certain disputes regarding the border. If the other party is also sincere, there will surely be good results in the future.

"In addition, the possibility of Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations has also begun. The development of Soviet-Japanese trade is beneficial to both sides. In summary, we can have reason to declare that the improvement of our country's relations with Japan has already begun. It is still difficult for us to predict how rapid this trend will develop. We do not know the extent of the Japanese side's preparedness. As far as we are concerned, we welcome this kind of lobbying from the Japanese side, and we will approach it based on our country's basic political stance and concern for peace.

### Denouncing British and American Policies: Sufficient to Prolong the War

"Finally, I will briefly describe a few words on the issue of contraband of war and the export of armaments by neutral countries to belligerent countries. The Soviet Union recently sent a letter to the United Kingdom, replying to its memoranda of September 6 and 11. The originals have all been published. Our memorandum explained our country's views on the issue of contraband of war, stating that the Soviet government does not recognize food, fuel for non-combatant people, and clothing as contraband of war, and believes that prohibiting the export of consumer goods is tantamount to forcing women, children, the elderly, and the weak into hunger and cold. The Soviet government also declared that this kind of problem cannot be decided unilaterally by the United Kingdom, but must be agreed upon jointly by all countries. We hope that the public opinion of neutral countries and the United Kingdom and France will recognize the fairness of our stance, and find a way to prevent the war between the armies of the belligerent countries from becoming a war of slaughtering the elderly, the weak, women, and children.

"In short, our country, as a neutral country, does not want the war to expand, and therefore takes all steps to make the destruction of the war lighter and end sooner, thereby seeking peace. From this point of view, the decision of the US government to lift the ban on the export of armaments to belligerent countries inevitably raises doubts. The impact of this decision obviously cannot lighten the war or promote its early end. On the contrary, it will make it more serious and prolong it. This decision is of great benefit to the US arms industry, but this is not enough to be the reason for the United States to open up the arms ban, of course not. "As described above, this is the current international situation and the principles of Soviet foreign policy." (A TASS dispatch)

### Different Perceptions in Various Countries

London

The main points of today's commentaries in various newspapers here all focus on the Soviet Union's decision to maintain neutrality. The "Daily Mail" stated that Hitler once said that Molotov's speech would be a turning point in the war, and he must now feel extremely disappointed. Mr. Molotov's speech has proved that it is not as Mr. Hitler imagined. Its main argument is neutrality. The "Daily Herald" said that Germany handed over the Baltic Sea to Stalin, and the reward it got was nothing but empty words. Hitler had requested the Soviet Union to compensate with aircraft and submarines, but Stalin only replied with a speech. (A Reuters dispatch)

Paris

All newspapers here believe that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech in the Supreme Soviet last night must have disappointed Hitler. Mrs. Tabouis stated in "L'Oeuvre" that although Molotov seemed to have confirmed the friendship between the Soviet Union and Germany, it was obviously not what Berlin had hoped for. Bertin also published an article in "L'Ordre," stating that it is quite obvious that the Soviet Union will maintain neutrality. Hitler can no longer vainly hope for unknowable benefits. The future relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union is difficult to foresee. (A Reuters dispatch)

United States

Today, the "New York Times" stated that the changes in the Italian cabinet and the speech of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov both have a significant impact on the war. Germany's old and new partners are taking this opportunity to reiterate their conservative neutrality. Hitler cannot gain much comfort from Molotov's speech, because the entire tone of Molotov contains the Soviet Union's only interest, which is to take advantage of the war to strengthen its own position and expand its international influence. The goals of both Italy and the Soviet Union are to take advantage of Hitler's war with other countries to seize opportunities and gain benefits. (A Reuters dispatch)

Japan

Today, all evening newspapers in Tokyo published Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech in the Supreme Soviet yesterday in large print, and especially paid attention to the section mentioning Soviet-Japanese relations. Some newspapers even wrote short commentaries. The "Asahi Shimbun" said that Japan is fully prepared to adjust its relations with the Soviet Union, but only if the Soviet Union shows a sincere expression to it. The "Hochi Shimbun" reported that Molotov has made a gesture of shaking hands with Japan, but it is not known whether he is referring to the left hand or the right hand. The "Kokumin Shimbun" also stated that Molotov's condemnation of the "isms" war of the United Kingdom and France is worthy of attention, and that Molotov, who is represented by the government, is generally recognized as the initiator of worldwide red propaganda.

### War Time European March (Continued) – London Special Correspondent – Shu Di

What kind of arrangement, estimation, and determination did Hitler use to take such a significant and unconventional action?

If the Soviet Union were a capitalist country, then without a doubt, Hitler would be determined to "divide" Polish territory with the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union is a country with a socialist structure, and there is no need to seize colonies. In particular, a territory as poor as the eastern half of Poland would be a great burden if the Soviet Union took it for itself without adopting the exploitative relationship between imperialism and colonies. Also, in the tacit understanding of this "Soviet-German Agreement," if both parties had completely determined to divide Poland into two parts, one belonging to Germany and the other to the Soviet Union, then Hitler would have been confident and would not have to worry about future Soviet-German relations, and therefore could use force. However, in the previous section (2), I have already said that this time, the Soviet Union and Germany only had a very vague tacit understanding regarding Poland, which was: in any case, a buffer zone must be left between the two countries, but there was no tacit understanding regarding specific boundaries. Even in the current situation with so many rumors in Europe, we have not heard anything about the specific boundaries of the future Soviet-German buffer zone in Poland. – This is a very noteworthy point.

If the two "if" assumptions mentioned in the previous paragraph existed, then we could immediately conclude that Hitler's invasion of Poland was entirely due to the formation of the Soviet-German Agreement. However, precisely because these two situations do not exist, Hitler's actions this time need to be investigated more deeply.

The actual situation is: rather than saying that Hitler suddenly had the idea to invade Poland because of the signing of the "Soviet-German Agreement," it is more accurate to say that he signed the "Soviet-German Agreement" in order to invade Poland. If we were to draw a simple formula to illustrate this, I think it could be drawn in the following chronological order: –

The Soviet Union and Germany begin buffer negotiations. At the time, the goal on the German side was to attempt to break up the British-French-Soviet negotiations; on the Soviet side, it was to serve as a second step in case negotiations with Britain and France failed, and at the same time, to promote the early completion of an alliance with Britain and France. The issue of Poland was not the object of Soviet-German negotiations at the time. The Polish issue expanded, and Hitler decided to invade Poland. Taking advantage of the failure of the British-French-Soviet negotiations, he intensified secret negotiations with the Soviet Union. With dramatic speed, Ribbentrop went to Moscow to formally sign the non-aggression pact. Finally, Poland was forced to submit, and Germany hesitated one last time. Germany began the invasion.

The first stage in this formula probably took several months and did not make much progress. The following five stages probably occurred in less than two months. I would like to add one more note: At the same time as the second stage was taking place, there was also constant contact between Italy and Poland. Because this point has a very close relationship with the relationship between the "Soviet-German Agreement" and the "German invasion of Poland," we must keep it in mind when studying the relationship between these two events.

This is a truly extremely complex situation! Carelessness can easily lead to being unconsciously blinded by propaganda from one side, and ultimately, the situation can be confused due to the inadequate use of language. I hope that my brief descriptions can avoid these two shortcomings, but I myself am not sure if I have already achieved this.

In any case, Germany has already invaded Poland. Now let's return to the event of "invading Poland" itself.

The event of "invading Poland" has many implications and extremely complex content. Hitler would never have taken this great risk without equally thorough estimates and the greatest determination.

First of all, we must say that until Britain and France declared war on Germany, Hitler was still expecting Poland to surrender to Germany. Germany's calculation was that in the east, it had removed the greatest reliable assistance. In the south, with the very rapid assistance of Mussolini, it had already obtained the complete neutrality of the Balkan countries. Now, Poland was geographically surrounded on three sides and trapped in the German net. And Western European British and French assistance was absolutely impossible in the short term. In this situation, Germany calculated that when Poland suffered one or two major military blows, it would be entirely possible to force it to surrender. Therefore, Italy did not participate in the war. This means that even when Germany and Poland had already opened fire, diplomacy between Germany and Poland was still continuing through the side door of Italy.

As of the writing of this section today, Britain and France have long since declared war, and this German estimate has completely failed. In terms of diplomatic operations, Hitler can be said to have suffered a defeat. However, to understand the entire evolution of the situation, it is still necessary to look back at Germany's desire in case Poland surrendered at this point. If Poland surrendered, the major premise, of course, would be to accept the so-called "Sixteen Points," the next step would be to cancel the "British-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement" and the "French-Polish Mutual Assistance Treaty," and the next step would be for Poland to join the German-Italian-Spanish bloc to confront Britain and France together. If this attempt were to be realized, then before long, German and Italian demands for British and French colonies would be brought up again, and the reactionary factions in Britain would be lured into the trap of attacking the Soviet Union again. In other words, apart from the fact that German and Italian strength would have increased again, the European diplomatic situation would more or less have returned to its old state.

Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was desperately trying to help Germany with this plan.

This is Germany's most ideal ending. If we were to give it a name, it could probably be: "A Slight War and a Victory."

However, Britain and France finally declared war. Hitler also had considerable expectations and preparations for this when he decided to use force against Poland. This means that Germany still has to continue writing this unfinished article.

In this second stage, there are three difficulties facing Hitler: first, after the illusion of a compromise with Poland was shattered, the next question was how to decisively and thoroughly defeat the Polish army in the shortest possible time. This means that the Polish army, which was relatively well-equipped, relatively well-trained, and numbered around 1.5 million, had to be resolved before Hitler hoped for any other steps. Second, the problem of how Germany should respond on the Western Front after Britain and France joined the war. Third, the problem of relations with the Soviet Union.

Now we know that Germany has now decided that it will take a completely defensive stance on the Western Front. Its "Siegfried" defense line is probably quite solid, and it would be quite difficult to break through it. At the same time, we also know that this line of defense is much longer than France's "Maginot" line, meaning that Germany can avoid the "Maginot" line and break into France through Belgium; France, in order to avoid the "Siegfried" line, the only way to break into Germany is to go through Switzerland, but there is the natural barrier of the Jura Mountains here. That being said, moving heavy troops to the Eastern Front this time is actually taking considerable risks. Of course, the major premise is that he does not believe that Britain and France will launch a large-scale offensive; secondly, he has another magic weapon, which is Italy's non-participation in the war. In order to avoid triggering Italy's participation in the war, Britain and France will probably not launch a large-scale offensive. (Hitler estimated this.) But there is another very obvious fact: if France attacks Germany through Switzerland, then without a doubt, it will irritate Mussolini. As for the large-scale battles between the "Siegfried" and "Maginot" lines, Hitler is prepared to deal with them. The remaining problem is the British naval blockade. On this point, first of all, it is again Italy's non-participation in the war. The British blockade, no matter what, cannot be complete. Italian ports in the Mediterranean Sea are loopholes for German goods and raw materials. Secondly, the war against Poland is a land and air battle and has little to do with the navy. Germany adopted a policy of defeat from the very beginning in its naval warfare against Britain and France and had no illusions at all. The only countermeasure is submarines, just causing trouble.

The future relationship with the Soviet Union is the most troublesome thing for Hitler. Of course, he has always claimed that attacking "communism" is a mission given by Heaven and has proclaimed himself as the savior of the world from "Bolshevism," but now he has to turn around and put on a smiling face to the Kremlin. This is certainly not a very comfortable mood. However, compared to the frustration of his exaggerated ego, there is another thing that really worries him: that is, the question of the Soviet Union's attitude in case the war against Poland expands and is prolonged. To be blunt, if the war is prolonged, the Soviet Union has the possibility of participating directly or indirectly. In other words, if the war expands and continues, Germany is very likely to be forced to end the war against Poland hastily. Comparing the two evils and taking the lesser of the two, which road to take between a Polish surrender and a Soviet war, anyone with a little intelligence at that time could know. Moreover, in order to avoid being forced into that predicament at the crossroads, Hitler's only effective move is to quickly and thoroughly resolve Poland; on the other hand, he must continue to put on the smiling face he is putting on for Moscow.

### Jiangsu Province's Post-War Education Funding Tightens – Province-Wide Education Revenue Only Reaches 40% of Pre-War Levels – Education Department Plans to Rectify Revenue and Curtail Expenditure

(Taixian News) Since the August 13th Incident, a large part of Jiangsu Province has fallen into enemy hands, so education revenue has been greatly reduced, making it difficult to maintain support. However, the Education Department has planned to increase funding and save on expenditures. The details of the Education Department's funding situation are explored as follows:

Province-Wide Education Funding

Jiangsu Province's education funding was originally very abundant. The provincial education expenditure budget for the 26th year (1937) included 346,744 yuan for educational administration fees, 436,808 yuan for higher education fees, 3,174,313 yuan for general education fees, 471,060 yuan for social education fees, 100,000 yuan for study abroad funds, 153,600 yuan for subsidies, 750,000 yuan for promoting compulsory education, 713,290 yuan for various temporary fees, and 256,000 yuan for debt repayment, totaling 6,401,815 yuan. The amount can be said to be quite large. However, after the 27th year (1938), most of the counties south of the Yangtze River fell into enemy hands, leading to extreme difficulties. In the first half of the 27th year, provincial education special funds revenue, according to statistics from 31 counties, calculated at a discounted rate, amounted to only about 347,661 yuan. In the expenditure items for the 27th year, excluding educational administration fees, the first half was 268,144 yuan, and the second half was 98,416 yuan. The budget for the 28th year (1939) also failed to increase. The state of exhaustion can be easily imagined. This cannot but rely on subsidies from the central government.

County Education Funding

As for county education funding, the total number of county education budgets in the 26th year was 11,220,861 yuan. Although the education administration and operation expenses of various counties were issued at an 80% rate in October of the 26th year due to the tense war situation, the general compulsory social education expenses were still paid according to the old practice without any reduction. In the spring of the 27th year, the general compulsory social education expenses of various counties were still paid according to the original budget practice. If local finances were difficult, the payment would be reduced according to the situation. A separate tight budget was prepared for the education bureau administration and operation expenses of various counties. In the second half of the 27th year, another decision was made to recompile a tight budget for the education budgets of various counties. A total of two tight budgets were compiled in the 27th year.

Rectification Plan

The provincial education department believes that education funding is so exhausted. In the current process of resistance war, it can only strive for a balance between revenue and expenditure and self-sufficiency. It has already made overall plans. In terms of expenditure, it first emphasizes cost reduction and then rectifies revenue. Regarding cost reduction, it strives for a balance between revenue and expenditure in the provincial and county education budgets, strictly implements tight budgets in the provincial and county education budgets, determines the principles for revenue and expenditure in the occupied areas, and restricts new projects and construction purchases. Regarding the rectification of revenue, it will investigate school properties, rectify school rents, determine the standards for education fee collection, and clean up the financial assets of provincial and county education agencies. All of these efforts are aimed at seeking remedies under the goal of balancing revenue and expenditure and self-sufficiency to avoid the crisis of educational funding depletion in the future.

### A Review and Prospect of Public Education Centers (3)

— Chen Lijiang

II. Future Prospects

The difficulties and shortcomings of the future path Public Education Centers have been described above. We should always actively try to overcome and remedy those difficulties and shortcomings. We cannot give up eating because of choking, or retreat from difficulties. The Public Education Center, as an educational institution, is very suitable for our country, which has a low level of culture and tight education funding. Because in countries with low levels of culture and tight education funding, on the one hand, there is no large amount of money to run various separately established educational institutions; on the other hand, the public needs ordinary education in their actual lives more urgently than specialized education. Furthermore, this kind of comprehensive facility is a collection of various undertakings, and its educational effect is naturally more powerful than separate establishments. At the same time, it is the center of public education implementation, so its strength is naturally greater than that of decentralized facilities, and it can also avoid various disadvantages of separate establishments. I believe that future Public Education Centers should take the following paths:

(1) The main purpose of the Public Education Center is not to run the center, but to run public education, to educate the public, to trigger their new understanding of life and new concepts of society, to create a new life and create a new society. In other words, the target of the Public Education Center is "people," not "things." Running the center without running education is "teaching things" instead of "teaching people." This is what we should take as a warning.

(2) The various facilities of the Public Education Center must be adapted to people, events, times, and places. We cannot excessively prescribe a fixed form. Therefore, the Ministry of Education only formulates a work outline. The education departments of each province and city should formulate the central work and its details of the Public Education Center in each province and city according to the work outline. Each Public Education Center should formulate its own business plan and work calendar according to the central work and its details.

(3) The teaching method of the Public Education Center should take the organization and training of the public as the highest principle, and all education should be attached to the public organization and training, so that they can obtain strong unity in group life and the spirit of seeking happiness for the masses. Only in this way can the public organization and training generate power, and education and public life can be integrated.

(4) In the internal organization of the Public Education Center, it is not necessary to set up all four groups in county and city Public Education Centers with insufficient funding. We should seek convenience in work. Even setting up only a guidance group is not impossible. We must avoid hindering the development of the enterprise due to the organization.

(5) The staff of the Public Education Center is extremely important. The success or failure of the Public Education Center is inherently related to the system, but its main body is the staff. Therefore, carefully selecting personnel is the only way out for rectifying and revitalizing the Public Education Center. When carefully selecting, we must pay attention to their personality, spirit, belief, and enthusiasm. After they are selected, we must pay attention to the assessment and further training of their work, and the business they run will naturally flourish.

(6) The amount of funding for the Public Education Center, generally speaking, should be at least 2,000 yuan per center per year. In places with insufficient funding, social education institutions such as libraries and sports fields should be merged into the Public Education Center. In terms of equipment, the central and provincial education administrative organs should try to provide subsidies as much as possible. Furthermore, the ideal Public Education Center should be a production machine that can be self-sufficient.

(7) The Public Education Center is not an omnipotent institution. At the same time, the society is so large that our manpower and funding cannot be omnipotent. Therefore, if we want it to be effective, we must pay more attention to contact and utilization. Contact means cooperation, and utilization means borrowing other forces. Both are beneficial to oneself and others. At the same time, we must know that our purpose is to seek the welfare of the public and promote society. As long as we can achieve this purpose, even if we work hard and endure hardship, some sacrifices are worthwhile. What is especially important is that we should not be greedy for credit when cooperating, and we should not be reckless when borrowing other forces, so that we can receive great support.

(8) The final destination of the Public Education Center is to make it a public education center, a public-owned education center. Therefore, all kinds of work should pay as much attention as possible to cultivating the public's automatic ability and spirit, so that it can be self-reliant, self-help, self-governing, and self-run. Only in this way can this undertaking truly become the public's own undertaking.

If we can do it according to the above-mentioned paths, I dare say that the Public Education Center is not only a rational system for transforming old education and creating new education, but also the active force for transforming the old society and creating the new society.

### Grass Court Club Decides to Invite Philippine Davis Cup Players for Exhibition Matches: Anson and Sanchez Pass Through Shanghai, Ponséck's Performance Still Under Negotiation

Europe's top player and Yugoslavia's Davis Cup representative, Ponséck, along with British Davis Cup main player Hale, were invited by the Philippine Sports Association to perform in Manila. At the same time, the Philippine Davis Cup representatives Anson and Sanchez will also return from the United States. The Philippine tennis stars and European famous players will pass through Shanghai one after another this month. This is a great opportunity that is hard to come by again. The Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Club has been in correspondence with the Philippine Sports Association, inviting them to perform when passing through Shanghai. According to Mr. Spike, the secretary of the Grass Court Club, yesterday morning, Anson and Sanchez will arrive in Shanghai on the President Coolidge on the 7th of this month, scheduled to berth at 10:00 AM, and return to the Philippines on the same ship at 5:30 PM the following afternoon, staying in Shanghai for one and a half days. They have also agreed to perform a second time in Shanghai. As for Ponséck and Hale, according to a telegram from the Philippines, they will arrive in Manila on the 27th of this month, which means that the estimated time to pass through Shanghai will be around the 22nd of this month. Whether they can perform in Shanghai at that time, although the negotiation has not made special progress, there is hope that the wish may be fulfilled. Besides Hale, another Yugoslavian superstar, Gugucevic, may also accompany Ponséck on this trip, which is also unknown. According to Mr. Spike's statement yesterday, it can be decided that Sanchez and Anson will repeat their previous performance in Shanghai. If the Coolidge can berth as scheduled, the exhibition match will be held on the afternoon of the 7th. If the voyage is delayed until the afternoon or evening, the exhibition match will inevitably be postponed to the 8th. Sanchez and others have achieved considerable results in the United States recently. Anson once used the "Toffee" strategy to contain Wimbledon champion and American number one player Riggs. On the same day, the "Flying Eagle" team, the runner-up in the South Seas Military and "Le" groups, will also play the semi-finals to compete for the runner-up final. The loser will be fourth, and the winner will compete with the loser of the "Xianle" and "Xufang" teams (i.e., the eliminated team in the overall championship) for the runner-up. The team that wins the overall championship will have an exhibition match with the host team "Qianghua" on a scheduled date. The results of the two groups are listed as follows:

Hundred Character Group: Le Character Group (Note) Qianghua's results are not counted. The championship belongs to Xianle. Lvpíng, Zhiqiáng, Jiaolián, and Huáfàn all abandoned more than two finals, and their qualifications were revoked according to regulations, and their results were cancelled.

### Shēn Bào Table Tennis Team's Match Report

Yesterday, the Shēn Bào table tennis team accepted an invitation from the China Travel Service's (Zhōnglǚ) team for a friendly match at the Zhōnglǚ's gym. More than a hundred people watched.

As a result, the Zhōnglǚ team was slightly better, and the Shēn Bào team was defeated by a score of nine to thirteen.

### Hong Kong's Two Soccer Giants Meet: Eastern Loses to South China, Guanghua Beats British Navy

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The two giants of Hong Kong's Chinese soccer, South China and Eastern, met on the 22nd of this month (October) at the foot of the Jia Shan. As a result, Eastern failed to avenge their loss from last year, losing two to one. Currently, South China is firmly in first place with three wins in three games. In Kowloon, the Chinese team Guanghua met the foreign sailors at the Police Stadium in Chenshi. Yesterday, Guanghua used a new formation. Li Siliáng, the new coach, was in high spirits and led the central army. Because there were not many British warships staying in Hong Kong, many first-class players had already gone to sea, and the lineup was not well organized. Guanghua took the opportunity, and the five forwards played like ducks to water, with good shooting skills, and finally defeated the Navy with a score of six to four.

Guanghua Team:

Li Guóqí, Li Guówei, Huáng Huájì, Xiè Jǐnhóng, Yáng Zǐxiáng, Zhāng Shùhuī, Huáng Jǐngcōng, Zhuō Shíjīn, Li Siliáng, Liú Fúquán, Tián Róngfā

### Finance: Hong Kong Banks Frequently Sell Foreign Exchange

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, the HSBC's listed exchange rates were all flat. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange rates, due to the end of the tenth month, American banks sold British currency to buy American currency, engaging in British-American exchange arbitrage. Hong Kong banks and Jewish merchants also came to sell, so the trend returned to hovering. The process in the first half of the day was still in a loose and weak state.

After opening, an American bank first came to sell spot British gold at five points to a certain British bank, and the situation continued to soften slightly. When HSBC's listed prices were announced without any movement and the silver equilibrium tax was announced down by small 0.0125, Hong Kong banks suddenly came to sell, and foreign banks' appetite was bland, so the market situation turned firmer.

At the same time, Qiao Zhífu sold British gold for this month at five points zero nine three seven five to Unilever and a certain bank.

Buyers were dispirited and exceptionally scattered, resulting in a drop of thirty-five yuan in the end. Opening in the morning, continuing the afterglow of the previous night, it rose another fifteen yuan to 3,740 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange reported weakness and was once quite stable, but after 10 o'clock, it suddenly became loose and firm, with the securities firms and gold shops competing to sell the most. Although the silversmiths' firms acted on behalf of Hong Kong banks and local banks, they absorbed a certain amount in one go, but the head office still felt abundant, so it once fell to a low of 3,680 yuan. At noon, the exchange market had already become slightly flat, and the shorts had also made a profit, eagerly thinking about replenishing, so it came out of the 3,700 yuan range. Until the noon close, it was 3,700 yuan. There was no foreign exchange market in the afternoon, and the gold market was deserted. It was initially opened with more scattered releases, hovering until the evening close at 3,690 yuan. There were very few changes in the middle, only 12 yuan of ups and downs. The entire day's trading was active in the morning, but surprisingly clear in the afternoon, totaling around a thousand taels. The silversmiths' jewelry gold did not change throughout the day, and the customs gold and so on remained flat.

Cooked red fell by thirty-five yuan

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), the foreign exchange was slightly softer at the initial opening, and the sentiment was still good. The market opened fifteen yuan higher, and the Qian Dui firm entered thirty taels from the securities firm, for 3,740 yuan.

After this, the foreign exchange suddenly turned firm, and the selling wind called up. The gold shop, the Qian Dui firm, and the securities firm competed to sell, although the silversmiths' firm entered more and released less, the head office still felt abundant, and it immediately fell by forty yuan. At that time, although the Hong Kong bank limited the purchase to 3,700 yuan, the number was not large, and it was difficult to match the continued small twenty yuan. The securities firm sold twenty taels to the Qian Dui firm, for 3,680 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange stabilized slightly, and a certain Qian Dui firm's appetite suddenly improved, so it rebounded by twenty-five yuan. The Qian Dui firm mutually did thirty taels, for 3,705 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange returned to a loose and firm state, and the gold shop and securities firm's selling wind rose again, so it was pressed down to 3,685 yuan again. Near the closing time, the foreign exchange returned to flat, and a certain Yu shop suddenly came to enter again, returning to a high of thirty yuan, and the gold shop mutually did fifty taels, for one two thousand seven hundred fifteen yuan. Later, the silversmiths' firm threw out and slightly weakened again, and the Qian Dui firm spat out twenty taels to the gold shop, for 3,700 yuan as the noon closing price.

### Securities: Foreign Debt Soars, Domestic Debt Moderately Good

In the unofficial market for securities, the market initially showed a slight tendency to weaken due to the emergence of many longs. Then, with the sudden rise of gold and the knowledge that foreign public bonds were trending upwards, the selling pressure suddenly decreased, and the market immediately turned better. The rising trend was also stable in the afternoon. The environmental news was dull, so the trend almost relied on the ups and downs of foreign exchange and gold. Although the rumors of negotiations between the United States and Japan were very prevalent, they were still under brewing. This matter has a great relationship with the rise and fall of our country and public bonds, so the trend of public bonds may temporarily hover because of this. Trading was worse than yesterday, only the longs were more numerous, so it was said that the bulls were in the majority. The market sentiment was quite powerful under this influence. As soon as the major investors moved, the market price would rise accordingly. The initial opening was stable in the morning, and it fell slightly. Later, Lianhe and No. 20 absorbed more, and the market price was raised immediately. The trend was the same in the afternoon. Type C broke through the nine yuan mark again, and No. 20 and Lianhe and others had an appetite again, so the market price was firm. As a result, it rebounded by 0.2 to 0.55 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock transaction, 50 shares of Zhejiang Industrial Bank stock were transacted, and the price was 62.5 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Does Not Have Much Rising Power

The yarn market has been tired and depressed for several days. Although there is no large demand from the southwest recently, sporadic transactions are gradually showing signs of activity, so people's minds have become stable again. It is a pity that the intake is not smooth, so the rising power is very weak. At the same time, the British exchange rate is also at the 5-point level, going in and out, and the market is becoming more and more silent. Judging from the current situation, a major rise is difficult to find temporarily. However, a drastic fall is unlikely to occur, because although the trend of raw cotton is tired and depressed, the extent of the decline is roundabout and far less than that of yarn, so in terms of the situation, the yarn market may have a period of hesitation.

At the initial opening in the morning, due to the shortening of the draft after noon the previous day, people's minds were restored, and the buyers were particularly strong. The momentum was boosted, and the opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 660 yuan, which was up by 15 yuan. At this time, although there were transactions among peers, the customer helpers did not eat the high price, and it fell back twelve yuan in an instant, falling to 648 yuan. The original reason was that the draft was lengthened again, and it gradually rose back a few yuan later, at 653, 4, 5 yuan, up and down. It was found that 1,240 bales were transacted in half a day, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse rose 19 yuan, and the market price of Tiannv rose 18 yuan. The factory opened 125 bales of 20-count Special Jincheng from the Yong'an factory, at a price of 655 yuan. The Chongxin factory opened 150 bales of 12-count Dafā, at a price of 615 yuan. Today, 570 pieces of cotton yarn are transported to Ningbo. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.

### Cotton Sales Show a Slight Improvement

Due to the significant activity of cotton yarn factories yesterday, both the inner and outer Dakang factories had needs, but the amount was not large, and the market situation was still calm. In addition, the yarn market was floating and uncertain, and the factory's thoughts were indifferent, so the market price was not much different from the previous day. The source of northern Jiangsu has been slightly reduced. Only 345 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived on the wharf, and 1,860 bales came from the north. The current sales of cotton are recorded on the left.

Another message, the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet these days. The lengthening of the exchange rate has made all industries stagnate, and Japanese manufacturers have no appetite at all. Only a certain peer is searching for one or two hundred pieces of West India in the market, and it is said that it is to offset the quota. There are also peers who intend to order American cotton, but they are deeply afraid of the re-lengthening of the exchange rate, so they will order American gold ingots to reduce the risk.

Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market, the market price was still firm in the early morning due to the more active transactions of peers. Overseas telegrams came to purchase, so the cotton price rose slightly. Later, due to the selling of a part of the reactionary and the profit-taking of the bulls, the market situation turned tired. As a result, the closing price fell 5 to 7 pounds sound compared to the previous day. India, including the forecast, rose 25 ropis, Egypt fell more than 10 pounds sound, and Liverpool was flat.

### Grains: Anxian Is Tight, Dugeng Is Still Flat

Dugeng: The rice market was stable after the noon market turned firm after falling back during the day. Only 14 or 15 cars of goods from Su, Jia, Feng, Qing and other places arrived, totaling more than 2,000 bags. Locals were active at bargain prices, and the inland gangs absorbed the Jiangbei Dujian, so the situation in the Jian market was once tight. However, the general locals insisted on the principle of not buying unless it was cheap, and they did not relax on the consumption. Therefore, although the sales market in the city was smoother than the previous day, the cellar seeds and green seeds on the market were oversupplied, showing a tired state and depreciating by about half a yuan. The remaining goods did not rise or fall. The statistics show that more than 7,000 bags of Changxi special-grade japonica rice and broken japonica rice, Su Tongchang Kun high-grade japonica rice, Qingjiao green seeds, kiln-grown wild rice, Sōngjiāng Hundred Brother six varieties, and new and old Yuan were traded.

Kexian: After falling loose the previous day, the buying interest in yesterday's market was active again. The local and rural locals had strong needs, and the inland gangs and hoarders were particularly active. Moreover, the saying that accumulating grain to prepare for famine has been very popular recently, and the large hoarders are trying to absorb it quickly. Therefore, when there was congestion at the head yesterday, the morning market saw an upward trend. According to yesterday's arrival of Nanjing Xian in 13 cars, Jianglun had a whole batch arriving, totaling more than 10,000 bags. Among them, 8,000 bags of new arrivals in the firm were not worth the cost due to the large donations, so they did not press out samples. The Japanese merchants only sold small batches, and it was rumored in the market that the new arrival cars and those shipped from Jiangbei had encountered unexpected obstacles. Therefore, the selling price of Kexian once rose by three or four jiao, and then some floating groups sold, and it only fell flat in the afternoon.

### Wheat Is Difficult to Overrise, Flour Remains Firm and Stable

The flour market remained firm and stable. Due to the high price of raw materials, the factories were still firm on the selling intention for large gang go-downs. The retail transactions in this street were only for daily needs. The unified city transactions were more than 30,000 bags, including the Green Battleship brand at 7.4 yuan, and the Red and Blue Car and Green Cannon Car at 7.5 yuan. The returned goods in the market were very dry, and the sellers were very eager, so the market price increased by several points to one jiao.

There are not many sources of wheat, and the inventory in the market has always been held by hoarders, and they cannot be fully supplied. However, the factories are also unwilling to make further advances for high-priced raw materials, so the market is difficult to overrise. The Tongshi Jin bought 600 bags from the Fuxin factory, and the hoarders traded 7 cars, and the price was the same as the previous market.

### Miscellaneous Grains: New Dalian Yellow Soybeans Have Been Thrown Open

The yellow soybean market yesterday, because new soybeans in Dalian have been thrown open, and it is expected that they can arrive in three or four days, people's minds have stabilized, and transactions have also been light.

Also, yesterday there were 179 bags of beans transported from Beisha.

### Sugar Market: Huizhou White Sugar Transactions Are More Active

The foreign sugar market was slightly tighter yesterday. According to a telegram from the Netherlands, raw white has also risen to 11.90 Dutch guilders. The association's allocation of spot 24 raw white rose by half a yuan, 53.5 yuan in this warehouse, and 54 yuan to 54.3 yuan in foreign warehouses. There was no change in the transfer cargo. Taigu car white did not rise or fall much, and the B mark was 58 yuan to 58.5 yuan, and the rest were retired. The H mark car red and Dutch red held their original prices. This cotton white rose by five jiao, No. 1 was 54.5 yuan, No. 2 was 54 yuan, No. 3 was 53.5 yuan, and No. 4 was 53 yuan. This ice did not rise or fall. In the national sugar, Yuantaiheng was the only one who entered thousands of bags of Huizhou white sugar a few days ago, and yesterday it opened another four or five hundred bags, the goods are more common, and the price was 56.3 yuan to 55 yuan, and the decision was 51 yuan. Yesterday, 600 bags of sugar were transported to Ningbo.

### North and South Goods: High-Quality Black Fungus Stands Out

Ordinary black fungus has not risen or fallen much recently, but the high-quality Sichuan ear in Shangzhuang is quite tight. It once opened to 337.8 yuan, and the secondary ear is even more scarce. For example, the large flower surface extracted from Shier ear also needs 380 yuan.

### Metals White Iron Sheet Sales Slow

The white iron sheet trade saw only local construction firms active yesterday. Merchants from other cities felt it was very quiet. It was found that all northern China firms in the city only took dozens of bundles. Local construction firms bought close to a hundred bundles, so the market was still good, and the prices were up by twenty to thirty cents. For example, 3-foot 6-inch sheets sold for $5.70 each, and 3-foot 7-inch sheets sold for $6.70 each.

### Textiles Cotton Cloth Gains Momentum with Lower Prices

The cloth market has passed the end of the month. Cheap goods from retailers in the market are gradually running out, and factory prices are firm. Local firms are showing signs of reselling to Suzhou. People's confidence is stable, and there is continued buying at lower prices. White cloth and coarse cloth have risen by 10 to 25 cents per piece. Fine cloth and fine twill are stable. Although dyed and bleached fabrics mostly still open at the original prices, the market atmosphere is already tightening. The British company Ewo Factory released 600 bales of 11-pound Three Rabbits, Three Deer, and Three Cats coarse cloth, which were purchased by local firms. Transactions were quite active. A total of over 400 pieces of white cloth, coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill were traded. Over 200 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, flannel, and printed fabric were traded. The Wenzhou-Nanjing firms handled over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, and colored twill. The Fujian firms handled over 3,000 pieces of plain serge and colored twill. The Yunnan firms handled over 2,000 pieces of colored twill, wool gabardine, and blue cloth. Overseas business has become a little quiet. Yesterday, 860 pieces of textiles were shipped to Ningbo.

Fine cloth firms opened 300 bales, with 12-pound Five Blessings offered at $18 per piece, Trumpet at $17.75, and Yanghe at $18.50. Therefore, the spot market price for fine cloth also increased by 10 to 15 cents per piece. Dragon Head fine cloth was $5.15. Fine twill was generally stable due to weak dyeing sales in the local market.

### Breeches Cloth Coats Still Popular

Recently, as the weather has turned colder, woolen coats and lined coats are increasingly being custom-made at Western clothing stores in areas like Dashijie.

### Coal "Mark White" Coal Drops Ten Dollars

Since a large batch of Hongji white coal arrived last month, inventories have piled up, and people's confidence is weak, causing the market to decline, resulting in few transactions among firms. However, yesterday, the "Yi Tai Xing" customs prices remained the same because water transportation fees and customs duties have increased, and costs are related, making it difficult to drop prices further. However, one firm offered "Mark White" coal at a reduction of ten dollars per ton, calculated as an internal price among firms. Lump coal was $106, small lump coal was $100, and coal dust was $58. Pick up from the warehouse yourself, and add extra charges from the firm.

### Road Construction Incident Beyond the Border: Due to New Attack Incident, the Bureau Intensifies Negotiations, British and American Consulates Research Specific Solutions, the Board Meeting Did Not Discuss

According to reliable sources from Westerners last night, the executives of the Municipal Council, in view of the shooting of a Western constable by the puppet police on Columbia Road on the morning of the 1st, have decided to promptly submit the specific plan drafted for the issue of road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai to the puppet government in order to resolve the disputes in the area as soon as possible. The details are described as follows:

Specific Plan

Regarding the issue of road construction beyond the border in western Shanghai, the Director General and CEO of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, and the Chief of Police, Mr. Barnes, have drafted a "specific plan" based on the "Proposed Outline" in order to discuss and resolve all disputes recently occurred between the Municipal Council and the puppet "Municipal Government". The plan was drafted at the end of last week, but due to its importance, the "Proposed Outline" was presented by the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, to the puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan on the evening of the 26th of last month. As for the "Specific Plan," it has not yet been sent out.

British and American Research

According to reliable news obtained last night, the Municipal Council is currently preparing multiple copies of the "Specific Plan" and distributing them to five British board members and two American board members for research and to solicit opinions. Outside of the board meeting, consultations will be held, and then the plan will be handed over to Chairman Fessenden to negotiate with the puppet government. The focus of this case rests on the British and Americans, and it is impossible to have the Chinese and Japanese board members publicly discuss it. Therefore, it is understood that the board meeting held at half past two yesterday afternoon, in addition to discussing routine cases, did not involve this issue. This is partly to avoid direct conflicts between the Chinese and Japanese board members, and partly because off-meeting negotiations allow for more room for maneuver.

Focus on Police Power

As for the content of the specific plan, the authorities are currently keeping it strictly confidential. It is said that the five Chinese board members have not been informed in advance. Generally, it is to advocate that the principle of joint management be adopted in the police aspect, just like the Yu-Fessenden plan (Yu Hongjun and Stirling Fessenden). The issue of taxes and fees will not be discussed for the time being and will be negotiated later.

### New Attack Incident

The issue of road construction beyond the border has not been resolved, and the encroachment of power by the puppet police beyond the border has repeatedly occurred, forming a confrontational situation with the concession police. At 0:05 am yesterday, another incident occurred on Columbia Road near Anhe Temple Road in which puppet police shot at a Western constable of the concession police. Details have been seen in the latest news column of this newspaper yesterday. The details obtained subsequently are described below:

Puppet Police Fired More Than Sixty Shots

The English "North China Daily News" reported that two foreign police officers of the Municipal Council's Police Department were involved in a minor accident with "Avenue Police" while driving a motor vehicle on the night of yesterday (31st). After the situation was resolved by Mr. Hemm and Lu, the two police officers were suddenly surrounded and attacked by other Avenue Police, and one handgun, watch, and electric lamp each were taken away by the Avenue Police. This incident occurred at 0:05 am today (1st) on Columbia Road not far from Anhe Temple Road. The Avenue Police fired more than 60 shots. The two foreign police officers did not retaliate because they could not see where the opponents were hiding.

Watch and Lamp Were Stolen

American residents Mr. Haining Xun and Mr. Glace were driving home when they were caught in the line of fire and were almost hit by bullets fired by the Avenue Police. The Avenue Police and the Central Army sent a large team to the scene to stop the shooting. After a long negotiation, the handgun was returned to the Police Department, but it was missing three bullets, and the watch and electric lamp were stolen by the Avenue Police.

Two Westerners' Cars Were in a Dangerous Situation

When American residents Mr. Hague and Mr. Glace were involved in this incident, their car followed a truck of Avenue Police along Columbia Road. When the police motor vehicle approached the truck from the opposite direction, gunfire suddenly erupted. The two cars had already passed each other, and the Avenue Police on the truck also increased their firing. Mr. Hague and Mr. Glace's car stopped ten feet away from where the two foreign police officers were taking cover. Several bullets whizzed past the car. Mr. Hague and Mr. Glace immediately drove the car back into the driveway of a nearby foreign residence to take temporary shelter.

Puppet Government Attempted to Levy Car Tax

The "North China Herald" reported that "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan recently replied to the Shanghai Consular Body Leader Nello, rejecting Nello's request to peacefully resolve the issue of cars traveling on roads outside the border before issuing a "Special Municipal Government" notice. The letter also stated that from January 1 next year, any cars traveling on roads built beyond the border of the Public Concession must display a "Municipal Government" notice.

### Constant Gunfire in the Western Suburbs: Chinese Army Attacking, Loud Explosions from Qingpu, the Battle is South of Hongqiao Road, Rumors of French Army Destroying Hand Grenades Cannot Be Confirmed

The English "North China Daily News" reported that residents of the Lujia Road and Kaixuan Road areas heard bombs exploding and sporadic machine-gun fire in southern Shanghai yesterday afternoon (31st) and evening until 9 pm. This is a sign that the guerrillas continue to attack the Japanese army. Residents of Hongqiao also said that they heard machine-gun fire from the south in the afternoon and a very loud explosion from the Qingpu area on the road west of the airfield around 6 am.

Loud Explosions from Qingpu

The explosions heard by residents yesterday morning were not caused by guerrillas but by the French army destroying hand grenades. This morning's newspapers stated that the explosions heard from 5 am to 10 am yesterday were all from the French army destroying hand grenades. However, the English "North China Daily News" could not confirm that the French army actually got up before 5 am to engage in this work, and the French army would not destroy its hand grenades in Qingpu or south of the French Concession.

One Said Explosions Destroyed Hand Grenades

The "North China Herald" reported that from 5 am to 10 am yesterday (31st), many explosions were heard intermittently in the Xujiahui Village area, causing great commotion among residents in the Western District. It has now been learned that the French authorities considered it unsafe to continue storing hand grenades that had accumulated for more than a year due to the possibility of spontaneous explosions, so they destroyed them. The French authorities notified the Japanese authorities of the planned explosion of a large number of hand grenades on Sunday, and then dug a large pit on the spot, placed the boxed hand grenades in it, and evacuated all residents within 500 meters of the area before detonating the hand grenades one by one. In previous years, the French authorities used to transport dangerous hand grenades to French warships and sink them at sea, but this year it was discovered that this could not be done, so yesterday's method was adopted.

Important Objects Were Hit

Chinese guerrillas in the area east of Qingpu and west of Hongqiao Road have been skirmishing with the Japanese army since the evening of the 30th of last month, and the attacks continued until yesterday. Residents living in the Kaixuan Road area heard intermittent explosions and machine-gun fire until 9 pm the night before. Residents of Hongqiao Road still heard machine-gun fire clearly coming from the south yesterday afternoon. According to residents of Hongqiao Road, a loud explosion was heard from the Qingpu area before 6 am yesterday, and some important objects were hit.

Japanese and Puppet Forces Panicked and Forcibly Drafted Laborers

Chinese guerrillas in the four suburbs of Shanghai are approaching daily, and all railways and highways have been destroyed, severely impacting the Japanese army's lifeline of transportation. The Japanese army cannot defend against this, and now orders the Avenue Municipal Government to instruct the thirteen "Avenue District Offices" to force local people to organize "Railway Protection Associations" or "Road Protection Associations." "Avenue District Chiefs" and "Avenue Township Chiefs" are taking the opportunity to exploit this, drafting laborers from house to house to protect roads for the Japanese. If a road is destroyed by the Chinese army, the laborers around that road will be severely punished. As a result, young people are forced to flee, and the number of refugees is increasing daily.

Japanese Army Defense Line Has Been Shortened

After the Chinese mobile forces in western Shanghai were thoroughly reorganized by the ×th War Zone Commander, most of them have been replaced by trained regular troops, with the Provincial Security Team as the mainstay. There are effectively two regiments of regular troops, supplemented by local militias. In the past week, the transportation lines from western Shanghai to Qingpu, Baoshan, Jiading, and the towns belonging to Shanghai County have been controlled. The Japanese army has shortened its defense line and concentrated its forces in the Jiangwan barracks and the Datong airfield. The puppet troops are hiding in the areas of the roads built beyond the border. Therefore, the gunfire has subsided slightly at night, and everyone is on edge. Puppet officials in puppet government offices outside the roads built beyond the border in western Shanghai are all in a state of infinite fear. The puppet "Police Sub-bureau" and the puppet "Court," etc., strictly closed the front and rear doors at 2 pm, and all puppet officials left, either living in Hongkou or Yuyuan Road, etc., and only returned the next morning after the Japanese army resumed patrolling.

Streetcar Scrip Limited to Use by Year End, Two Companies Will Announce, Puppet Scrip Numbers Huge

The two concession streetcar companies, due to the lack of fractional currency, issued scrip. Now, as the Central Bank's fractional currency notes have been issued and circulated, the two companies have decided to gradually recover the scrip issued starting today. All issued scrip will be limited to use until December 31, after which it will be void. This will be announced to the public soon. It is also heard that the Public Concession issued scrip because counterfeit scrip was found on the market. The number of scrip recovered and destroyed by the company has reached more than ten thousand yuan, resulting in huge losses.

### Yangtze Air Force Bombs Japanese Warship, Previously Reported as Phoenix Sun, Mistake for Eastern Revival Sun

According to a telegram from Fuliang reported the other day, the Japanese transport ship Phoenix Sun was sunk by the Chinese army while sailing on the Yangtze River near Jiujiang, etc. At the time, the language was unclear, whether it was bombed by the air force or shelled by artillery. The families of the ignorant Chinese workers serving on the Phoenix Sun were especially anxious. According to inquiries, the ship involved was not the Phoenix Sun, (by the way, the Phoenix Sun was previously converted into a transport ship and is now a Yangtze River liner managed by the Japanese East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd.) but the newly built Eastern Revival Sun of the East Asia Company, with a deadweight tonnage of 2,000 tons. It had only been sailing on the Yangtze River for one month when it was attacked by Chinese aircraft. The bombing hit the edge, destroying part of the deck and completely damaging the engine room, making it unable to move but did not sink. It is now docked in the Yangtze River and will be towed to Shanghai for repairs. The Phoenix Sun will also return to Shanghai.

### North Jiangxi Road Gap, Inspection Not Relaxed, Japanese Soldiers Constantly Patrolling, Residents Continuously Moving Elsewhere

In the eastern area of North Jiangxi Road, which is blocked by barbed wire in District A of the north of Suzhou Creek, at the gaps at the junctions of Wenjianshi Road and Haining Road, the Japanese soldiers guarding the posts are still extremely strict in their inspections of residents entering and exiting. Those carrying packages must be ordered to unpack them for inspection before being allowed to pass, regardless of men, women, old, or young. This is undoubtedly related to the current tense situation in the suburbs of Shanghai. Furthermore, within the eastern blockade line of North Jiangxi Road, traffic has been blocked, and Japanese soldiers are constantly patrolling, causing residents to move elsewhere one after another. According to an investigation by a Datong News Agency reporter, there were originally 89 shops in the area, but 33 have now closed down, accounting for approximately 27% of all shops.

### Two Concessions Preparing for Winter Defense, Examining the Strength of Police Officers, Taking Contingency Measures at Any Time

The police authorities of the British and French concessions, due to the arrival of winter, in order to ensure security and the safety of the lives and property of citizens, the Chairman of the British Concession, Mr. Fessenden, has scheduled to inspect all levels of Chinese, Western, Indian, and Japanese police officers at the Racecourse on the morning of the 5th in order to understand the strength and prepare for winter defense. The French Concession has decided to recruit more than 400 Chinese constables, who are currently being trained in teams every morning and are being sent to various police stations and roads to practice in order to increase police strength. Winter defense will be implemented next month, but the current defense of the concession is extremely tight, and if there are special circumstances, contingency measures can be taken at any time, which is more than sufficient.

Central Ticket Seller Enthusiastically Saving People

The colleagues at the ticket booth of the Central Sports Field on Albert Road in this city are enthusiastic in helping people in need. Since the August 13th Incident, they have been donating funds to charitable organizations every month without interruption. The total amount has reached more than 4,000 yuan. The ticket selling colleagues rely on labor to make a living. Their fundraising method is that each person pays two cents per week, and the total amount of 180 yuan is raised per month. Since the Citizens' Group launched a campaign to solicit donations to support refugees, they have been using this money to support 90 refugees per month. Recently, the Citizens' Group received a gold adoption medal, but because there are too many people, it is difficult to decide who should get it, so they launched a charity sale to raise temporary donations. Whoever contributes the most money will win the honorary medal. Only the colleagues at the ticket booth can participate. Mr. Cai Jinlong has already offered 200 yuan to win this honorary medal, but it is still in the auction. The charity sale donations will still be transferred to the fundraising committee of the Citizens' Group. Their enthusiasm is truly admirable.

### People's Land in Northern Shanghai Forcibly Purchased, Japanese Set Up "Shanghai Constant Property Company" Arbitrarily Valuing and Giving Non-Cashable Bonds

The "Shanghai Constant Property Company," invested and operated by the Japanese, has recently been forcibly requisitioning people's land in the northern Shanghai area in an attempt to build residential houses, prosper the market, and lease it for profit. The area of land being requisitioned everywhere is shockingly large. The real estate properties owned by Chinese landowners in the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas after the war will all be lost to the company. If a landowner goes to negotiate after their land is requisitioned because they do not have a pass, it will be confiscated. If they go to file a complaint, the company will arbitrarily value it and only give them a non-cashable bond with the lowest price as payment, requiring the landowner to sign and fingerprint it, with no regrets allowed. The person in charge of this matter is Hirai, the section chief of the Constant Property Company. After their property rights have been infringed upon, all landowners gnash their teeth.

### Japanese Open Fire in Fushan to Prevent Rice from Being Transported to Shanghai, Forty to Fifty Japanese Soldiers Rush to Fushan, Fire Guns to Threaten and Prohibit Rice Ships from Docking

The "North China Herald" reported that the German-registered river steamer Dalian was docked at Fushan Port on the Yangtze River around noon yesterday (31st). At that time, the boatmen of two rice-laden sailing ships intended to load the rice into the German steamer, but this was stopped by the Japanese army's machine-gun fire, fortunately without injuring anyone. However, the Dalian steamer had to return to Shanghai without carrying this cargo because the sailing ship boatmen were

Threatened by Japanese Guns

and refused to sail back next to the German steamer. The reason for this was that the Japanese army stationed in Hupukou learned the news that rice would be loaded onto the German steamer for transport, so forty to fifty fully armed Japanese soldiers, carrying a machine gun, boarded the Japanese-registered but actually Chinese-owned Xin Jiangnan steamer around 9 am yesterday and ordered it to

Sail to Fushan as Quickly as Possible.

According to eyewitnesses, when the steamer arrived at Fushan Port, it docked about 1,000 yards away from the Dalian steamer. Without warning, it opened fire from a distance. It is estimated that the Japanese soldiers fired 35 shots, but that was enough to make the sailing ship boatmen stop trying to load cargo into the German steamer and

Paddle Back to Shore.

The Dalian and Xin Jiangnan steamers both arrived in Shanghai last night. The story of the Japanese army opening fire has been confirmed by the crew members of the two steamers. It is also heard that the Japanese army did not board the Dalian steamer but only ordered the captain of the Xin Jiangnan steamer to take them back to Hupukou and then allowed the steamer to leave.

Although the Xin Jiangnan Steamer Was Hit by Several Bullets,

no casualties were reported. As for whether there were any casualties among the people on the sailing ships, it was not confirmed last night. It is learned that the two steamers each weighed

About Eighty Tons.

It is heard that the Japanese intend to prohibit any ships other than Japanese ships from loading and unloading cargo at various ports on the Yangtze River estuary, and unless the requirements of Japanese ships are met first, third-country ships will not be allowed to carry goods and passengers for transport between various ports on the Yangtze River estuary and Shanghai. The Xin Jiangnan steamer sailed from Shanghai to Fushan yesterday morning, and the general cargo it carried was blocked and could not be unloaded onto the sailing ships. As a result, both passengers and cargo were

Forced to Return to Shanghai.

It is also heard that a team of about 30 Japanese soldiers used machine guns to strafe the rice-laden sailing ships from the Dalian steamer for ten minutes, then took the confiscated rice, 100 bags, and 400 cases of cigarettes back to Hupukou, while the Dalian and Xin Jiangnan steamers were allowed to sail back to Shanghai.

### Kato to Visit Shanghai Soon, Planned Negotiations with the US and UK, Intended to Supplement the Tokyo Conference, Conducting Timely Discussions

A special Tokyo dispatch from the "North-China Daily News" on October 31st reports that, according to the "Nichinichi Shimbun," Japanese Special Envoy Kato is about to depart from Tokyo for Shanghai to engage in negotiations with British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, along similar lines to supplement the Tokyo conference. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson told reporters today that the date of Kato's departure for Shanghai has not yet been decided. When Kato arrives in Shanghai, he will naturally hold timely discussions with U.S. and British authorities from time to time, but it is unlikely to be a special negotiation. At the same time, Kato remains in Tokyo to discuss important Sino-Japanese matters, especially the establishment of Wang Jingwei's "New Nanjing Government." Regarding the New Nanjing Government, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson told reporters that although Japan will support the "government," the issue of formal recognition will be a matter for the future.

### Labor Strike Takes a Sharp Turn, Lun Chang Factory to Resume Operations, Japanese Army No Longer Insists on Armed Garrison, Management Agrees to a 30% Wage Increase

The labor strike at the British-owned Lun Chang factory has lasted for more than five months. Both labor and management have suffered great losses. Although both sides wanted to resume work as soon as possible, it could not be resolved for a time due to behind-the-scenes manipulation. However, the management has continued to work hard to resolve the labor strike, and the more than 2,000 workers in the factory could no longer tolerate it and began to accuse a certain representative of holding up the labor strike. It is now known that the labor strike has taken a sharp turn for the worse. The details are recorded below:

No Longer Insisting on Requiring Troops

The main point of contention between labor and management this time was that the management had to allow armed Japanese troops to be stationed in the factory. The management believed that this matter had a great relationship with the management rights of the factory, so it would rather sacrifice business than agree to this condition. Now, the Japanese side knows that the reason is lacking. If they insist on using this condition as a prerequisite for resolving the labor strike, they will be even more opposed by the workers. Therefore, they instructed a certain representative not to mention this condition again. However, the previous condition of increasing wages by 20% has now been changed to a 30% wage increase. It is said that the management has indicated that this condition is acceptable.

Workers Accuse, Agree on a Deadline

According to the factory workers, the dates for receiving subsidies from the Greater People's Assembly are the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month. Every time the workers receive the subsidies, they will ask the representative about the progress of the negotiations. The representative would say that negotiations are underway. Now, all the workers in the factory know that this is all a lie. They already know that in the past few months, although the management has repeatedly decided to seek a reasonable solution, the representative has never negotiated with the management. Therefore, yesterday, when the factory workers went to the Greater People's Assembly to receive subsidies, they accused them. A representative of the Greater People's Assembly, Gu, had no choice but to declare to the workers at the "Dadushi Government" on Dongchang Road that he had indeed negotiated with the management and that a clear response would be obtained on the 11th of this month.

Already Repairing, Preparing to Open the Factory

The factory workers only receive a subsidy of 13 yuan per month and cannot maintain their lives. Most of the workers have switched to working in other factories. According to reporters from Da Zhong News Agency, the factory has already started repairing the machinery. All raw materials and goods have been transported into the factory, and it is expected that the factory will be able to resume work soon.

Inland Post Office Messengers Demand Subsidies, Convene Representative Meeting to Discuss Solutions

More than two hundred postal workers from thirty-eight inland bureaus affiliated to the Shanghai Postal Administration, including Kunshan, Songjiang, Jiading, Zhoujiaqiao, Qilin Town, Taicang, Chongming, and Nanyang, have requested the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union to ask the Director General of the General Administration, Mr. Chaparin, to approve a monthly living allowance of ten yuan, due to the high cost of living inland, expensive rice and firewood, and huge expenses. The union has agreed to this. Yesterday, representatives Cao Licheng, Zhang Chengfu, and Zhang Zhensheng, etc., together with union representatives Cheng Zuoqing and Wang Kai, visited Mr. Gao Zhicheng, the section chief of the inland business section of the Postal General Administration. In addition to detailing the difficulties of life and rising prices, the representatives requested that the Director General, Mr. Chaparin, be asked to grant the same treatment as the Shanghai Bureau. Mr. Gao expressed sympathy and promised to ask the authorities to handle it. After the representatives were satisfied, they convened a representative meeting at 10:00 a.m. that afternoon on the fourth floor of the General Administration on North Suzhou Road to discuss solutions. The union also sent Cheng Zuoqing and Wang Kai to attend and provide guidance. After discussion, it was decided to wait for the outcome of the negotiations between the section chief of the inland section, Mr. Gao Zhicheng. It is learned that representatives of the postal workers of the inland bureaus are staying in Shanghai, waiting for a satisfactory solution.

### Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Restores Traffic, No Need to Get Off the Train En Route

Between Nuozhu Station (133 kilometers from Kunming) and Longtan Station (204 kilometers from Kunming, 40 kilometers from Kaiyuan) on the domestic section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the entire line was once blocked due to flooding and damage to the roadbed. After repairs, slow trains have been barely maintained since October 15. However, passengers must get off the train and walk in the damaged sections. As for the Michelin express train, it is still suspended. A telegram was received from Haiphong, stating that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway authorities have now completed repairs to the damaged roadbeds and have decided to resume the operation of the Michelin express train from the 3rd of this month. The date of the train is still twice a week. The night train departs from Hanoi on Tuesdays and Fridays, and connects with the Michelin train to Yunnan in Yongmai the next morning. The entire journey takes only 24 hours. As for the slow train, there is no need to get off the train and walk in the damaged sections.

### Public Outcry, Mitsui Stops Egg Seizure, Foreign Merchants Able to Receive Purchased Eggs, However, Each Basket Must Pay Two Yuan to the Japanese Army

The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that after the large-scale seizure of eggs by Mitsui & Co. was exposed in the press, the company's highway robbery action has largely stopped, and foreign merchants have been able to receive the eggs they purchased at the mouth of the Yangtze River. This statement has been confirmed at the meeting of the Foreign Merchants' Egg Canning Association this morning (1st). The most important difficulty at present is that the Japanese army charges two yuan in gold for each basket of eggs.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Reorganizes Chongming County Administration

Local news reports that since Chongming County Town was occupied by the Japanese army, the county administration has been stagnated. It is now heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has appointed Lu as the new county magistrate of the county, ordering him to take office as soon as possible and carry out a major reorganization. As for all the guerrillas in the area of ​​that place and Qihai, the government has already determined a whole method for effectively compiling and training them, so that they can become elite troops. This is because the command could not be unified before, resulting in the dispersion of forces.

### Traces of Master Yuanying

The Shewen News Agency reports that Master Yuanying, president of the Chinese Buddhist Association, has been detained for twelve days since he was arrested at the Yuanshe Lecture Hall on Daxi Road on the 19th of last month. Although various parties have been trying to rescue him, there is still no news of his release. Recently, it was rumored that Yuanying had been transferred from Jiangwan to Nanjing. It has now been learned that Yuanying is still being held in Shanghai, but is no longer being detained in Jiangwan.

### Detained Crew Released, Polifemo Changes Nationality, Japanese Navy and Army Have Different Opinions Because of This, US Consulate Must Have Serious Protest

The Panama wheel Polifemo, managed by Norwegian merchant Hualun Foreign Firm, loaded coal in Shanghai on the 26th of last month and berthed at the Xin Mitsui Wharf in Pudong to unload coal. On the morning of the 30th of last month, two Japanese and Korean people suddenly came, accompanied by a team of puppet police, and arrested two Chinese crew members, etc. This matter was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to relevant sources, the two crew members arrested were the second and third mates, so the shipowner attached great importance to it. After the incident, he reported to the US consulate and requested rescue. The Japanese and puppet officials falsely accused the two crew members of anti-Japanese activities, which is completely untrue. Moreover, the third mate (name unknown) also has a British passport and has already become a British citizen. After the second mate, Li Jing, was arrested that morning, he was released and returned to the ship in the evening. The two crew members went to Hualun Foreign Firm to report the next day. The wheel has been transferred from Xin Mitsui Wharf to Hefeng Factory Wharf in Yangshupu on the morning of the 31st of last month. It is also heard that the Panamanian merchant has sold the wheel to a Norwegian merchant, and will enter the dock in Shanghai for repairs within days. According to foreign sources, the Japanese Navy was not informed in advance about the Japanese Army Special Operations Team and the puppet police detaining the two crew members of the Panama wheel. It is believed that this is an act of overstepping its authority and extending its power to the scope of the Navy. As a result, the Japanese Navy was furious about this matter. The US consulate will also have a serious protest.

### What Worries Parents, Loving Children, Must Follow This Path (2)

— Sanjie

In order to cope with the diverse society and dedicate oneself to the country, people study hard and concentrate on research during their youth. Although it cannot be said to be as bitter as "hanging one's head and piercing one's thighs" or "collecting fireflies and reflecting snow," the spirit of "diligence" and "learning while struggling" is indeed commendable. Parents will naturally show an inner smile when they see this situation.

Children's learning is progressing day by day, but their physical health is invisibly declining day by day. The school's report card does make you smile, but in an instant, you turn to think about your children's health. Why isn't it as strong as before, and their food intake has decreased terribly? This evokes a sad heart and makes you look worried. Although you also think about giving your children tonics, they are ineffective and add to your infinite depression.

### Four Banks Ordered to Handle Foreign Currency Term Savings, Centralizing Overseas Chinese Funds to Store Legitimate Foreign Exchange, Special High Interest Rates Allow Savers to Earn Interest

The Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that savings are the key to cultivating good virtues in the people and developing economic undertakings, in addition to urging various banks to actively handle savings deposits in accordance with laws and regulations, and allocating their savings to productive undertakings, now promulgates foreign currency term savings deposit measures, designating China, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks to handle them, and the government guarantees them. As for various commercial banks, etc., all those approved by the Ministry may also handle this savings. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture have always accepted and stored foreign currency deposits for overseas Chinese and domestic merchants due to business relations. However, the interest rate was very low. Since the Department of Finance issued the measures, it has followed the foreign currency term savings deposit measures stipulated by the Department. It is also heard that various commercial banks have decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for special approval to handle foreign currency deposits. However, this foreign currency deposit is limited to British, American, French, and other foreign currencies approved by the government, and is converted into foreign currencies for storage in legal currency in order to prepare for future periodic payments and reduce the risk of exchange rate fluctuations at any time. However, the term for foreign currency deposits ranges from two to five years, with interest rates ranging from four to seven percent. The term for deposits converted into legal currency ranges from three to five years, with interest rates ranging from two to three percent. It is said that the aim is to bring overseas Chinese funds back to the country and use these funds to develop economic construction. At the same time, it allows the industrial and commercial circles that use legitimate foreign exchange to store in advance and obtain the interest rate they deserve, and reduces the manipulation of black market foreign exchange speculators, so that the black market foreign exchange can also stabilize.

### Ships from Tianjin to Shanghai Must Undergo Quarantine

Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Section Announcement No. 10 states, "There is now a cholera epidemic in Tianjin. All ships coming to Shanghai from that port (including Tanggu and Dagukou) must undergo quarantine in accordance with the measures stipulated in this section's Announcement No. 4 of June 29 this year. All shipping merchants are hereby notified. Port Director Tebeck."

### Strictly Investigate Shanghai-Ningbo Goods

Recently, the shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo has been frequent, and the goods shipped from Shanghai or exported from Ningbo are extremely crowded. The Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Commerce is thinking hard about the methods of dumping goods by the Japanese side, or counterfeiting them, or changing their appearance, or buying national workers' factories to use them. It is extremely difficult to distinguish them. Special cadres have been added to strictly inspect them in various coastal areas, and all chambers of commerce have been notified to pay special attention to them. If suspected Japanese goods are found, the local anti-Japanese and defense teams will review and identify them to prevent them from being mixed in.

### Two Patrolmen are Loyal, Diligent, and Brave, Municipal Council Especially Commends

At 8:30 p.m. on July 22 this year, a team from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department's Search Team, led by foreign probationary patrolman Zbrowski, was searching pedestrians near Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road when they saw a car passing by. Just as they were about to order it to stop and conduct a search, the passengers in the car suddenly opened fire, and at the same time accelerated and tried to escape. The police officers immediately fired back. The car moved forward a few steps, but was forced to stop due to a flat tire. The armed thugs in the car left the car and fled into a nearby lane. The police officers bravely chased after them. At the time, a patrolling Chinese patrolman No. 708 nearby witnessed the thugs resisting arrest and immediately opened fire on the thugs. As a result, one member of the gang was injured and captured. Two Mauser pistols, fifty-five bullets, and five hand grenades were found in the vicinity of the incident. It was later found that a few minutes before the occurrence of this case, there were twenty political assassins who were hired to attack a newspaper office on Avenue Edward VII. The gang members involved in this case were their accomplices and participated in the incident. The Police Department Special Awards Committee considered that the two patrolmen were loyal, diligent, and brave, and deserved commendation. The Bureau approved the issuance of a Police Special Merit Medal to each of them in order to show encouragement.

### Suzhou Blood Case, A Puppet Official Shot and Killed

According to visitors from Suzhou, a case of eliminating traitors suddenly occurred again in the city on the morning of the previous day. The victim was named Feng Runsen, who was nearly sixty years old. Before the incident, he had served in the education and political circles and served as the accountant of the county government for many years. After Suzhou fell, he served as the puppet "Section Chief" in the General Affairs Office of the Puppet Maintenance Association. He was then transferred to the puppet "Department of Education" last year, serving as a second-class "clerk." His actual "affairs" were as "Director of the Reception and Dispatch Office." On that day, Feng was taking a chartered car from his residence in Dingxiang Lane to the "Department" to "work." When he was about to reach Pingjiang Road, a strong man suddenly stopped the car and shot him. Feng was shot five times and fell to the ground. The puppet "police" heard the news and sent him to the hospital for treatment. However, because he was hit in the vital parts, he died yesterday. The assassin calmly escaped after the incident. The puppet organization authorities kept the matter strictly secret, and the puppet "newspapers" did not mention a word. Some said that Feng was shot because his adultery was exposed and he was harmed by another lover of his mistress. In fact, this was a trick by the puppet side to stabilize people's hearts. It is heard that Feng's mistress has been detained by the "Special Agency."

### Husband Marries Another, Wife Asks for Alimony

Li Acui, a woman from Songjiang, is 28 years old. Her parents are both dead. She came to Shanghai to work for a living. At the age of 23, she met Zhu Zhuting from Suzhou and they got married. Later, Zhu lost his job and took Li back to Suzhou to live. At first, they got along well, but soon Zhu came to Shanghai alone to make a living. At first, he sent living expenses to Li every month. Zhu felt lonely living alone in Shanghai, so he married another woman. He regarded Li as a worn-out shoe and ignored her life. Li sued for alimony in the Wuxian Local Court. Unexpectedly, the war broke out, and Li also fled to Shanghai. She had no choice but to live with her husband and his lover, barely making a living. Unexpectedly, Zhu's new love thought it was wrong and often quarreled with her husband, forcing Li to leave. Zhu was bewitched by lust, listened to slander, and often abused Li, and declared that he would choose another match for her. Li could not bear the abuse, so she left alone to avoid relatives' homes. On the one hand, she filed a lawsuit against Zhu Zhuting in the First Special Court, demanding alimony. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu opened a court session to summon her. The defendant did not arrive. Li Chenshu recounted the incident. The court ordered another summons for trial.

### Golden Eagle Radio Station Manager Detained, Stumbled His Son, Seriously Injured

Huang Guoping, manager of the Golden Eagle Radio Station, room 514, Shenzhou Hotel, Zhejiang Road, his son Huang Renchu, is 11 years old. Two months after Renchu was born, his biological mother died of illness. Huang Guoping then remarried a woman surnamed Mou as his stepmother. The stepmother has some discrimination against the son of her ex-wife, and the treatment is naturally slightly different. Renchu's character is also slightly inappropriate. Recently, Renchu stole money and fled to his relatives' home. He was found and sent back to the Golden Eagle Radio Station by his grandfather Huang Xingtang the day before yesterday. Guoping gave him a reprimand. Renchu intended to escape. Guoping stopped him, causing Renchu to stumble to the ground. As a result, he injured his spleen. Huang Guoping's friends Qian and Cheng sent him to various hospitals, but they were rejected because of the serious injury. Finally, he was sent to Renji Hospital. After the hospital's diagnosis, if he did not undergo surgery, his life would not be guaranteed. Even if surgery was used, there was only a 50% chance of success. In order to save Renchu's life, surgery was used. The Laozha Police Station also received a report and sent Chinese Detective Wang Yingjie to investigate, and arrested Huang Guoping. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, saying that it is still difficult to predict whether Renchu's life is in danger, so he requested permission to temporarily detain him so that he could be prosecuted after confirmation. Qian Hongye, the head of the Criminal Court, interrogated Huang Guoping and ordered him to be detained for another trial at a later date.

### Hengren Shipping Company Liquidator Sues Manager for Debt: Wang Yigong and Xu Guansheng Each Hold Their Own Account

Xu Guansheng, the manager of the now-closed Hengren Shipping Company, was recently sued by Wang Yigong, the assistant manager and liquidator of the company. Wang Yigong, through lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, filed a complaint in the Second Special Court's civil division, alleging debt owed. Presiding Judge Yu Changzi opened a hearing and summoned Xu Guansheng, but the defendant failed to appear, and the hearing was postponed. Yesterday, Judge Yu continued the trial in the Seventh Civil Court. Defendant Xu Guansheng, accompanied by his attorney Zuo De, appeared and awaited questioning. First, Wang Yigong stated the purpose of his lawsuit, saying: "The plaintiff and defendant Xu Guansheng are

Sworn Brothers."

"Last autumn, the defendant opened the Hengren Shipping Company on Hankou Road and hired the plaintiff as assistant manager. Shortly afterward, the company went bankrupt. The defendant then appointed the plaintiff as the company's liquidator, stating that he would provide a monthly allowance of 300 yuan for transportation expenses. At the time, the plaintiff had many affairs to manage, but because he and the defendant were brothers, he could not refuse. The plaintiff liquidated the Hengren Shipping Company for the defendant, and by the time it recently closed, he had advanced over 9,700 yuan, most of which is supported by receipts. In January of this year, the defendant also borrowed 18,000 yuan in cash from the plaintiff. The plaintiff has sent letters to the defendant demanding repayment of the aforementioned advances and loans, but the defendant has

Ignored Them."

"The plaintiff had no choice but to file this lawsuit." The court then questioned the defendant. Xu Guansheng testified that he had not borrowed any money from Wang Yigong, and that the seal on the IOU presented by Wang was not his. Regarding the advances, Xu stated that the bills presented by the plaintiff were also not entirely truthful. When Wang Yigong requested the court to question the defendant about the dozens of supporting documents for the advances, the defendant remained evasive. At this point, the court deemed further investigation necessary and adjourned the hearing.

### Language and Popular Literature

— Wen Ge

The complexity of Chinese dialects and the large number of illiterate people in our country are undeniable facts. The reasons for these phenomena are the obstruction of the custom of being attached to one's homeland and the result of metaphysical education. Although there are naturally other important reasons besides these, these seem more important to the problem itself. If we eliminate these two obstacles, we will be unable to correct the abnormally developed morbid phenomena. Therefore, many people understand the importance of this point and have launched a popular literature movement to use its power to penetrate into a realm without obstacles or barriers, so that our knowledge and spirit can thoroughly interact with each other. This is a task worthy of attention, and every literary and art worker should undertake it without hesitation.

However, if there are only efforts in the field of popular literature, there is still a problem, because its scope is only to approach the masses who know a few words. It is still unable to approach the wider masses who are illiterate. Therefore, many people realize that this shortcoming is also important, and they have promoted the new writing movement to unify language and writing and improve the knowledge level of the people. This is also a task that we cannot hesitate about at present, and no one can underestimate it.

These two movements are actually unified, but only differ in direction. Their essence lies in breaking through the barriers of dialects and the obstacles of illiteracy. We cannot only care about popular literature and ignore the improvement of writing, nor can we only care about the improvement of writing and ignore popular literature. Both sides must be taken into account. In this way, can we thoroughly unify spoken and written language, and can we truly make the whole country without barriers!

The language exhibition will open soon. This is considered my dedication. I understand that this exhibition is necessary for us, because it is the best way to let the public understand the content of popular literature and the new writing movement first.

Well then, let's work hard!

### Water Carriers in Beiping City

— Zhu Shunzhang

In the dim Beiping city, the sound of the night watchman's clapper and some wild birds flying over several courtyards with their dark branches, at the same time, the sound of creaking water wheels rises at the bottom of the alley.

Closer, those water carriers, their clothes stained with oil and tattered beyond repair, barefoot with swollen feet in the cold weather, pull heavy water tanks as they come. They sway dangerously, lift their cramped legs, and stagger along the road in trembling steps, splashing some water... Finally, the rotation of the wheels speeds up, sending their shadows out of this street, far away, until the mournful sound of the wheels stops, and Beiping City is immersed in the morning light.

The prayer bells of the Roman-style church have just rung, and in the hustle and bustle of women with bright hair carrying vegetable baskets going to the market, you can still hear their voices.

"Sir, have you had breakfast yet?" A water carrier with a thin noodle in his mouth and a rope looped over one shoulder, squeezed in the middle, raised his head and shouted when he saw me.

"Oh, I've eaten. Is the river water frozen?" I replied to them in admiration as I watched them carry the pipes. They also mischievously squinted their eyes and gave me a few pleasant gestures...

The water carriers in Beiping City live a very hard life all year round, especially in the winter. In the alleys that are like incense burners, where ice doesn't melt and sunlight doesn't reach, there is no fire burning in their houses. When it snows, they have to rely on these few jackets to walk the long road.

Being a water carrier is not necessarily a lowly profession. There are fathers and sons working together, brothers working together, and sometimes even women with disheveled hair helping their husbands "make a living." Most of them are people who have been displaced from the Songhua River to the turbulent Bohai Bay, and then manage to find work. So, when they are idle, they often chat candidly about what you want to ask, sharing their misfortunes with you.——

Walking into the dilapidated and dilapidated remaining houses, the first thing that catches your attention is a few straw hats hanging on the wall and a few untidy straw clothes. Stepping into the courtyard, they are all there, peeling tasteless dried braised beans, sitting by the well and leisurely making plans.

I have been to such places the most, and I simply say that I like to approach them the most. They are not very rude. When they meet outsiders, they do not deliberately lower their status to speak. They can share some of what they have in their hands with you, surround you in the middle, and tell you the most sincere words in detail.——

"Sir, flowing from the sandy plains to here, although not without any joy, if we were to live in tall buildings and big houses, we would still feel like we had lost something. We are people without a home, but we have never stopped thinking about going home. When our blue veins are bulging, when our noses are running, when we are sweating in the winter:—we are all full of longing."

"Sir, it's really too hard: when you are still in sweet dreams, we have to draw water; when you are eating warm porridge, we are still pulling the cart, until the gates of the Forbidden City in Beiping open: then we drag our tired bodies back to eat hard things. Sir: Which of us brothers doesn't shed tears on that night? We often think like this: when the tide under the Lugou Bridge splashes, we think of the high tide of the Songhua River.……"

Indeed, according to what the gentlemen leaning on the arched counters said, their situation when they came was hard enough. Many of them came when they were very young, and now they are pulling the cart for their fathers. The fathers are still deceiving these children like that: "Children, if you pull the water cart all over the city, you will meet your mother." However, the adults send them out the door with tears in their eyes. Who doesn't worry about the sadness of the children's disappointment afterwards?

Ah, the ancient city of Beiping is full of shrinking, dispirited breath. They rarely see the emblem of the country, they rarely see the plows in the fields, they rarely see the conch shells, but once they see it in a dream-like way, they will never take back the shout that disturbs the quiet air in the mansions of the county officials: "We water carriers have fought for these——go back."……

The evening mist envelops the towering "copper frame," which is "Beiping City," ah——no, I have often seen a few green sparks erupting on the aerial tram lines.——It has been many years since I left Beiping!

May the water carriers achieve their grand aspirations. They have already rushed to one end of the river back to their hometowns. May the mornings in Beiping City no longer have the heavy sound of water tank carts, but instead intensify the north wind, teaching the yellow-robed gentlemen in the city to personally carry water buckets to shake the windlasses——

Finally, the lives of those resolute water carriers should be a brand new leap forward.

### Visitors

— Jinzi

Last night, close to dawn, I had a dream.

It was an autumn morning. I was walking slowly by the small river in my hometown, and there seemed to be a thin layer of morning mist in the sky. Dewdrops sprinkled coolness on the leaves of the evergreen trees. There was no sound around, and the river flowed silently. The lightness and tranquility made me fall into deep thought.

This contemplation, when I woke up, stirred up so many nostalgic ideas!

If I were in my hometown, the chrysanthemums would have bloomed early!

What kind of season is this————

I went to the lake alone, drifting on a small boat, letting it pass freely through the long willow branches, parked under the white stone arch bridge. There was a pressing coolness in the heart of the lake. Turning back, I stepped into Green Willow Village again and went to the bamboo forest to watch the chrysanthemum festival. Under the thatched eaves, there were large characters made of chrysanthemums. The house was full of chrysanthemums, competing for beauty and blooming with different and gorgeous flowers.

I found a secluded place to sit down and rest for a while. Dusk quickly poured down, and the early cool weather was not cold. The evening wind brushed the autumn mood into my lap from the forest.

Or, I went to the earth hill with a few children, bending down to pick the daisies by the roadside; I came back and inserted them in a gallbladder bottle. The pink-purple petals were like delicate little faces, shyly hiding in the green leaves, as if with infinite tenderness, secretly revealing themselves to people.

In the evening, the desk lamp shone a light blue light, making it look even more like the stars in the night sky at the end of July, dozing in the corner.

When I think of these scenes now, they only add to the misery of the guest window. My home has been shattered into only a pile of rubble, and the fields have long been bombed into scorched earth. As for the chrysanthemums, I seem to see them being cut into pieces under the shining bayonets, like dismembered corpses, scattering petal by petal on the ground.

How the people in foreign lands yearn for its northern fields day and night! But the days of wandering are endless, and life is like a red-hot iron whip just drawn from the furnace——

In Jiangnan, where else can one find autumn except on the thin clothes of the wanderer?

But this is not worth hating!

'Death is not the end.' At this time next year, the seeds of the chrysanthemums will sprout again from the soil, braving the cold dew and the severe frost.

Yes, what is there to be nostalgic about in Jiangnan! I should go back, from that small river, from the lake, from the earth hill, from the vast rice fields, to visit the news of the newborn chrysanthemums.

### News from the Cultural World

— Pi Ling

### Torrent

— Yu Doucun

I wish I were a rushing torrent, never ceasing.

There is no need to inquire about my source. Even if I am a small raindrop like dust, I have a great ambition: to keep sprinkling, moisturizing the haggardness of the earth with crystal clarity, irrigating the dryness of the barren soil. In this way, I can move my partners, unite my comrades, and converge into a vast clear stream.

If anyone asks why I want to flow, I will say: life symbolizes a long road, and the era is like a revolving wheel. If you don't rush forward, you won't catch up with the journey of life. A great era does not allow stillness, even though there are green grass, red flowers, weeping willows, and dark willows on both sides of the riverbank. You cannot leisurely stay for a moment and greedily admire them. Whoever is greedy will not catch up and fall behind!

There is no need to inquire about the scope of my rushing. Wherever there is darkness in the universe, that is the realm of rushing. I will flow, perhaps flowing through the rolling Yellow River, Yangtze River, Pearl River, and even the Yalu River, washing away all the violent and bestial acts on the riverbank. I will disperse the oppressive shadows of suffering compatriots and light the lamp of the heart.

If anyone asks why I want to rush so loudly and fiercely, I will tell him: I am exerting the power of my talent, stirring up countless waves, like ten thousand horses galloping, military horns blowing, and war drums thundering, extinguishing the sighs and moans of the weak, and arousing the fighting spirit of the warriors. I flow, fiercely, past the simple village and through the beautiful hillside, unceasingly, I drum up the waves.

My journey is very long and vast.

Life is tense, and the times are great. Neither allows me not to flow, nor allows me to flow quietly.

Therefore, I am a torrent, leaping forward.

### The Entertainment World: Rotary Club Sponsors Movie to Collect Toys for Impoverished Children

— Xin Ying

——The movie will be screened in major theaters in rotation before Christmas——

Before Christmas, Shanghai usually has various organizations launching movies to collect toys for impoverished children. In Shanghai, especially after the war, there are countless impoverished children who have not enjoyed entertainment all year round. Therefore, in order to allow these impoverished children to have fun during the Christmas season, organizations such as the YMCA and the Rotary Club usually launch movies to collect toys for impoverished children before Christmas. Currently, with little time left until Christmas and the New Year, the movie sponsored by the Rotary Club to collect toys for impoverished children has already begun to be screened in major theaters in rotation.

The movies to collect toys for impoverished children are screened every Sunday morning, in rotation at major theaters. People who go to see the movie do not have to spend money to buy tickets, but each person can bring a new or used toy to exchange for a ticket. This year's movie sponsored by the Rotary Club to collect toys for impoverished children was screened for the first time last Sunday, October 22, at 10:30 AM, at the Nanjing Grand Theater. Because this type of movie is aimed at children, the movies screened are also limited to children's movies. A considerable number of children attended, and more than 5,000 new and used toys were collected.

The second screening is scheduled for November 5, which is this Sunday morning at 10:30 AM, at the Great Shanghai Theater. According to the original plan, all the films screened will cater to the tastes of children, and will be as exciting as the previous screening at the Nanjing Theater. The Shanghai offices of various Hollywood film companies have expressed their support for this good deed and have unconditionally lent films to the Rotary Club for screening. After collecting the toys, the Rotary Club will repair the used ones one by one, in addition to the new ones, in preparation for distributing them to impoverished children during the Christmas season. I hope that the children who like to watch movies will bring toys and exchange them for tickets to visit. Especially old toys that are useless at home, bring them to see the movie yourself, and the impoverished children can get toys to play with. What a win-win situation! Don't miss this opportunity!

### Random Thoughts on Watching a Play at the Carlton

— Shiwuxuan

The Carlton recently revived an old play. I went to see it on Thursday night, and by 7 o'clock, it was packed. While other theaters are competing with low prices, the Carlton can still hold its own, which proves the drawing power of Xin Fang should not be underestimated. Therefore, what I want to discuss is limited to Xin Fang. In the first part of "Song Jiang, Tenth Return," it was performed by Bai Sui and Su Wen together, and then by Xin Fang and Xi Chun. Song Jiang met Liu Tang on the road, acting hesitant and aloof, portraying the ambiguity between acquaintance and unfamiliarity vividly. The running scene in the tavern and the climbing of the stairs were urgent and tight, done in one breath, which can be said to embody the scene at the time and is a masterpiece. Waking up in the inn, with eyes half-open and half-closed, glancing at the morning light through the window, showing the unwillingness to face the dawn, was extremely wonderful. The scene of returning to the inn, checking the pouch, and killing the daughter-in-law was neither rash nor chaotic, just right. However, after the killing, holding the bloody knife, he seemed dazed and crazy, grabbing at the air with both hands for more than ten minutes, which seemed excessive. This is because Song Jiang was not an incompetent person, and he already had the motive to kill the daughter-in-law the night before. Although the killing was forced, after the killing, he should have first checked for the whereabouts of the letter. When going downstairs, he also said, "It's good to do things and take responsibility alone." This shows that Song Jiang was a good man, not a reckless fool without any ideas. Even if he was emotionally moved and mentally flustered, he would not be so extreme. Therefore, in my opinion, this scene's expression was a bit too much. In general, actors should understand the role's identity and represent the role's actions, so that the audience can take the false as real and forget that it is a play. If they are too serious and the actions are unrealistic, it will make the false even more false, and one can tell at a glance that it is a play. Xin Fang's performance is unique in the north and south. Taking this play as an example, actions like shrugging, shrinking the neck, and rolling the eyes are more pronounced than before, which I fear will lead to the fault of being excessive. I wonder if Xin Fang agrees? Recently, Mr. Xu discussed the issue of money, and Xin Fang and Xu Chun both said that a tael of gold would suffice as an answer. "Chopping the Scripture Hall" and "Chasing Han Xin" are both Xin Fang's signature pieces, flawless from beginning to end. Being able to sell out that night was, in no small part, due to the drawing power of these plays. Since hearing about Xin Fang's founding of the Yifeng Society, I have been expecting Xin Fang to reform drama with his unique expressive talent, combined with precise arrangement and directing, and his future achievements are limitless. The so-called Shanghai-style opera, it should be known, is not a traitor to the old drama. Adapting to the times, it can indeed be a unique color in the Chinese theater world. Xin Fang bears the name of "Yifeng" (Changing Customs), and should live up to the reality of "Yifeng". "Jiao Ben Su Chen" will soon meet the Shanghai audience. I sincerely hope that the playwrights pay attention to the word "Yifeng", rather than using publicity slogans like "Undressing and Praying to Fire in an Ancient Temple for Two Birds Sharing a Nest." Although these words can attract audiences, Yifeng Society is different from the Shanghai style of other theaters. I love Yifeng Society, and I love Xin Fang even more, so I offer my humble opinion, hoping it is worth listening to.

### A Record of Listening to Songs at the Xinguang Theater

— Zhang Changqiu

Zhao Jinrong, the new actress in the second installment at Xinguang, has been performing since taking over from Wu Suqiu, and it has been a score of days now. Yesterday (the 28th), I watched her final performance of "The Mandarin Duck Tomb," and I am writing this record specifically.

I took my seat at eight o'clock, and Ma Xiurong's "Mu Kezhai" was already nearing its end.

"The Great Water Curtain Cave" was staged at 8:10. Although Liang Xuanchao is young, his martial arts skills are solid. When the fighting began, the golden light shimmered, dazzling the audience.

The highlight was Chen Shaolin's "Riot in the Mansion and Emerging from the Trunk." Shaolin's singing this time was more rounded and mellow than in the previous installment (when Wu Suqiu performed). The rhyme was pure, and the phrasing was natural. It was indeed a fine performance in the style of Yu. However, his vocal range is still lacking in width, which is his shortcoming.

The finale, "The Mandarin Duck Tomb," began at ten o'clock. Jinrong, succeeding Wang Fengche, looked very much like Yanqiu, with a dignified and graceful appearance. Her expression was not suited to frivolity, but excelled at tragic beauty. Her melancholy and sorrow, with a frown locked between her eyebrows, made people feel pity for her. However, her figure is rather plump, so her stage presence is naturally not as pleasing. Her singing style had the strength and sweetness of Lanfang, as well as the ups and downs of Yanqiu, melting the styles of Mei and Cheng into one, which is truly remarkable. In the final segment of "Fan Er Huang," every line imitated Cheng's style. This play was taught to her by her teacher, Yanqiu. Assisted by Zhou Weijun as Xie Zhaolang, who was refined and elegant with a clear and crisp voice, he was truly no less than Ye Shenglan. Zhang Chunyan's Yang Zixu was also steady and practiced.

This tragic and beautiful new play, though exquisite and tight, in the first act, where Wang Fengche fell ill due to longing for Xie Zhaolang, and her sister-in-law, Wu, asked Zhang, the Taoist priest to write a letter to be sent to Xie's mansion, the dialogue between the Taoist priest and Wu was overly verbose. In my humble opinion, it should be slightly revised, otherwise, the brilliance of the whole play will be diminished.

### Anecdotes from the Paradise of Music

— Xu Muyun

The Case of Filicide and the Bizarre Case of Patricide

If we were to compare the relationship between teachers and students in the past with the present, they would not be comparable. The accuser in the patricide case was the daughter of the deceased. It is said that dragons have nine offspring, each different. She saw that her father's death was too tragic, and her own ability was weak, unable to stop the brutal actions of her two brothers, so she resolutely reported to the police to capture Qin Ji and Qin Xiang. But in doing so, her Zhou family has been cut off. Her father is dead, and both sons will face the ultimate penalty, while her mother also has her deserved punishment. Originally, a good family ended up in such a tragic scene, with only her, a weak girl, left unscathed. Filial sons can certainly be killed, but Zhou Yongjie was also mean and ungrateful, and his temperament was violent. This is also a case of planting bad seeds and reaping bad fruit. All those who become wealthy through unjust means or fail to educate their children properly should take this as a warning. The theory of karmic retribution may not be entirely believable, but it should not be completely disbelieved either.

If such a case of violating ethics had occurred in the old feudal era, not only would the local officials have been punished, but even the neighbors would have been held guilty. For Qin Ji and Qin Xiang, who are intellectuals and have received considerable education, their teachers would probably also be severely punished. Now, times are different, and of course, the crime only extends to the perpetrators themselves. However, in my opinion, such an inhumane and unprecedentedly heinous crime should not be adapted into a play and performed in public, because even a three-year-old child knows that such acts are wrong. It seems unnecessary to use the power of drama to edify the world. If it is made public, it would only feel too cruel, making viewers unable to bear to witness it. The minds of the Shanghai people are too quick. A certain theater has already adapted this event into a play and will stage it soon. In my personal opinion, I dare not go to see it. (131)

Minister 4 Advances to 5, Horse 8 Retreats to 6, Cannon 8 Retreats 7, Horse 5 Advances to 3, Minister Horse Advances to 4.

According to the original work, if, after the sixth move, Horse 7 Advances to 8, and the Elephant 1 Retreats to 3, then Cannon 9 Retreats to 8 for a draw. Also, in Variation 1, if, after the seventh move, Horse 5 Retreats to 4, and Pawn 6 Moves Horizontally to 5, then the subsequent variations become complex and there is no fixed method. However, the chances of double horses winning against a lone cannon with a missing minister are very slim. It is difficult to win unless Black makes a poor move. Due to space limitations, not all variations are published. (Han)

### Zhang Aiyun Pleads for the Disaster Victims in Tianjin

The Tianjin flood is indeed an unprecedented catastrophe. Ms. Zhang Aiyun witnessed the tragedy and expressed deep sympathy. Recently, major philanthropists in Shanghai have been organizing theatrical performances to raise funds. When discussing this with Aiyun, she readily agreed and will perform continuously for three days, starting today (the 2nd), at the Golden Theater. The plays Ms. Zhang will perform are "The Tower Sacrifice of the Scholar" on the 2nd, "The Escort" and "The Trial in the Three Halls" on the 3rd, and "The Golden Lock" on the 4th, all of which are her masterpieces. The people of Shanghai are fortunate, and the disaster victims will also benefit greatly.
