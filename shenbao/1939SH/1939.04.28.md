Editorial

### The European Situation and Japan's Dilemma

This newspaper published a Reuters dispatch yesterday, which stated that two British newspapers reported the following:

The Times of London Tokyo dispatch stated: "The ongoing internal deliberation within the Japanese government is of utmost importance. It remains undecided on what course to take. No matter what encouraging words Hitler may deliver in the German Reichstag on Friday, it cannot be said that Japan is willing to fight for the Axis powers in the Pacific. This situation, as well as the future of the Japanese cabinet, is now very delicate."

The Daily Mail's diplomatic correspondent stated: "Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was originally scheduled to visit Berlin, but there is no news of when he will depart. This is probably a symbol that the negotiations to turn the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance have broken down. According to informed sources in Rome, Ciano has now canceled his plan to attend the German Reichstag to listen to Hitler's speech. Japan's hesitation is due to its naval authorities being wary of President Roosevelt's order to concentrate the US fleet in the Pacific. However, Hitler is still making a final effort to get the Japanese government to change its attitude."

The reports from the two newspapers are complex and interwoven. They involve a wide range of issues and have far-reaching implications. They represent a panoramic view of the entire world problem, a great mystery of which even a hair's breadth can lead to a distance of a thousand miles, and its true nature is unfathomable. The severity and complexity of the problem are such that no force can control its evolution, nor can any wisdom grasp its future. Those involved in the problem can only bury their heads and strive to strengthen their own position in order to achieve a more favorable outcome; otherwise, they can only observe the course of events. To predict fortune or misfortune today is pointless. However, some general remarks can be made: Aggressors, insatiable in their greed, will ultimately encounter resistance and collapse. Japan will inevitably be defeated in the Far East, and Germany and Italy will inevitably be defeated in Europe. If Germany, Italy, and Japan collude, they will ultimately perish together. The speed of destruction is difficult to predict, but the stronger the attitudes of the Soviet Union and the United States, the faster the anti-aggression front will prevail.

A mystery is a mystery because the problem, from beginning to end, will be divided into an unknown number of stages. Each stage has its own set of divergent paths. Each path must have an end, but we do not know where it will end, nor do we know the form of its end. Taking the most recent stage as an example: Germany and Italy's actions in Europe, encompassing and swallowing everything, seem to have no end in sight, but President Roosevelt's telegram of appeal suddenly caused a setback, forming a historical stage. Now, the reply that German leader Hitler will give tonight is a representation of both the past and the future, and the beginning of a new stage. There are many possible ways to unfold the new stage: Overtly rejecting peace proposals while covertly stopping acts of aggression, allowing time to pass and flexibility to maneuver, thus followed by various international negotiations for division of spoils and price negotiations, this is Method One; outwardly acting evasively while competing to expand strength, looking left and right, taking advantage of opportunities, continuing their lives of cunning seizure, this is Method Two; replying with sarcasm, drawing swords and stretching bows, revealing the hidden agenda, engaging in close combat, this is Method Three. These are the three general possibilities. If it involves entering and exiting, capturing and releasing, moving deftly through time and space, then there are many possible ways, not confined to one pattern. However, these various possibilities also become different premises that affect the Far East. Only with different premises can we not determine what role Japan will play in the drama. Moreover, as reported by The Times of London, Japan is still pondering the matter fundamentally and does not know what course to take. To put it another way: If Germany and Italy advance, will Japan advance with them, resist them, or stay away from them? If Germany and Italy hesitate, will Japan encourage them or hinder them? If Germany and Italy advocate peace, will Japan advocate war, take it as an opportunity to "step down" in the Far East, or advocate peace in Europe but war in the Far East? What is meant by peace - peace with Britain and the United States, peace with the Soviet Union, peace with the Republic of China? What is meant by war - war in the Indian Ocean, war in the Pacific, or war on the coast of the East Sea and between the shores of Lake Baikal? Japan's "not knowing what course to take" is such that there is no way to foresee the end of the problem.

We have previously argued that the German-Italian Axis called for anti-communism to attract Japan as a partner. Since Japan's invasion of China, encountering resistance and almost exhausting its strength, Germany and Italy should have realized the uselessness of this partner, and Japan must also know that it is of no benefit to Germany and Italy. So it goes, with their so-called anti-communism as the theme. As the situation shifts, what they call for becomes more and more false, and they stray further and further from the theme. Thus, what Germany and Italy want to use their partner for lies elsewhere - since they are not actually engaged in anti-communism, they do not need to attack the Soviet Union from both ends of Eurasia, but rather to supplement Germany and Italy's absolutely insufficient navy. Indeed, while it may be contemptible to attack the Soviet Union in the name of anti-communism with this lame friend bogged down in China, at sea, Japan is one of the three strongest powers in the world. It is not without reason that German leader Hitler is still making a final effort for Japan. Japan knows this; why would they use the navy they built with decades of hard work as a tool for Germany and Italy? The combined total of the navies of Japan, Germany, and Italy is not enough to match Britain and France. The smaller European countries that side with Britain and France also have their own minimum number of warships. So, what is Japan's navy fighting for if it cannot win? Furthermore, the US fleet is watching from behind, ready to strike at any time. Japan knows this, yet it still hesitates and does not firmly reject Germany and Italy. There is no other reason than that China has confidence in ultimate victory, while even the most stubborn Japanese no longer have confidence in victory today. The deeper they sink, the harder it is to pull themselves out. However, they have the notion that the turmoil in Europe is an opportunity for Japan to extricate itself. What they are hesitating about is how to participate in the European turmoil to help them extricate themselves. Going against the tide and making a desperate gamble cannot lead to extrication; it only hastens their demise.

### Outline of Battlefield Propaganda Made by the Military Affairs Commission

(Chongqing) (Continued from the previous section) (10) Propagate the fact that the enemy can only control the points and lines in the areas "occupied" by the Japanese invaders, and that most of the rest of the country is still under our control, so that the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines believe that as long as we work hard, the enemy's power will shrink even further. (11) Propagate the enemy's indiscriminate use of poison gas on the front lines to slaughter our heroic soldiers, the enemy's massacre of our people in the war zone, the burning of our homes, rape, and plunder, and the indiscriminate bombing of our undefended cities in the rear, deliberately destroying our charitable cultural institutions, etc., in order to arouse the hatred of the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines. (12) In the war zone, it is especially necessary to expose the enemy's various conspiracies and deceptive propaganda, expose the sinister intentions of the enemy's petty favors, and explain that these petty favors are temporary deceptive measures, so as to awaken the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines and prevent them from drinking poison to quench their thirst and causing future troubles. (13) Expose the ugly faces of the traitors and puppet organizations, announce the past evil deeds of the large and small traitors who misled the country, harmed the people, and acted arbitrarily in their hometowns, as well as the various shameless acts of selling out the motherland and oppressing the people, in order to arouse the hatred of the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines for the traitors. (14) Propagate the facts of victories achieved through military-civilian cooperation in various places (such as the cooperation between the residents of Jiang County and Nanqiao Village in Shanxi and the army, completely annihilating more than 200 enemies), so that the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines deeply understand that military-civilian cooperation is the only key to our victory over the enemy. (15) Widely publicize and explain the general outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization and its implementation methods, the National Civic Code and its oath, convene soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines on a regular basis, hold National Monthly Meetings, take an oath to abide by the National Civic Code, and earnestly implement the National Spiritual Mobilization to establish an indomitable and steadfast national spirit and complete the main conditions for winning the war of resistance. (16) Widely publicize and explain the military-civilian cooperation code formulated by this department, and strive to make the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines abide by it in order to improve our only key to defeating the enemy.

(B) Key Points of Propaganda for Battlefield Troops: (1) Follow the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek that "The second phase of the War of Resistance is the period when we turn from defense to offense and from defeat to victory," in order to elaborate on the characteristics of the second phase of the strategy, and explain that "The second phase of operations is to complete all the deployments on the strategy of winning the final victory after consuming and exhausting the enemy's forces in the first phase." (Chairman Chiang's words) From then on, turn from defense to offense to achieve "Destroying the enemy's dream of aggression and causing him to fail" (Chairman Chiang's words) and win the final victory. (2) Regular troops stationed behind enemy lines must, when necessary, send out some squads to engage in guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla teams can gather some teams to form regular troops. There is no absolute boundary between the two, so it is necessary to make both understand the necessity of learning from each other's essential functions. (3) The second phase of the War of Resistance has expanded the war zone, and the war front has become longer and more difficult to defend. Transportation is more inconvenient, and the enemy's forces are more insufficient to be distributed, so they will inevitably leave us with many gaps that can be taken advantage of. Therefore, we must strengthen the cooperation and contact of operations in all directions in the operation, and must strive to cultivate the spirit of love and mutual assistance of the troops towards friendly forces to ensure the victory of our operations. (4) The army cannot win victory without the help of the people. The troops staying behind enemy lines, especially the guerrillas, must rely on the people's love, cover, and support. Therefore, the troops in the war zone must have good discipline. "Judging from the experiences in various places in the first phase of the War of Resistance, as long as the government asks the people to do something, as long as there are good methods, the people will be enthusiastic and happy to follow. It can be seen that only the army has let down the people, and no people have let down the army." (Minister's words) Therefore, political workers in the troops behind enemy lines must do everything possible to publicize and infinitely improve the automatic political and military discipline of the troops. "(A) Political Discipline: The troops must "zi" enter and exit to publicize, "chou" clean up, "yin" return borrowed things, "mao" compensate for losses, "chen" be fair in transactions, "yi" speak politely, "wu" strictly abide by all the regulations of the New Life Movement, and "wei" respect good folk customs, so that the people do not hate them, and the troops actively strive to realize the principle of "service is propaganda," earnestly help the people solve difficulties, serve the people, and win the favor of the people. (B) Military Discipline: Must absolutely obey superiors and faithfully execute orders, "cultivate the concept that officers and soldiers value orders more than life," be sincerely united with comrades, manage and love subordinates, be kind and helpful to friendly forces, be hardworking and enduring, and study and research at any time to develop the ability to "fight on their own" once in a difficult environment, and cherish bullets, guns, livestock, utensils, etc. (5) Battlefield troops must be responsible for establishing and consolidating revolutionary political power and organizing revolutionary people. Based on the principle of "propaganda is education," train cadres and strive to make every officer and soldier a propagandist and organizer of the people. Based on their knowledge and abilities, they should propagandize, educate, and organize the people in order to expand the effectiveness of political work and consolidate our political power. (6) Battlefield troops, especially guerrillas, often operate behind the Japanese lines. The Japanese will definitely use all kinds of methods to "sweep" us, and use means of sowing discord, threatening, and enticing to disintegrate us. Therefore, every combatant or other worker must have a strong belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance, and must have the determination to sacrifice for the country and the nation in order to consolidate the anti-Japanese base area, develop the guerrillas, and create the power to crush the Japanese. This requires political workers to resolutely and continuously promote and educate them, improve their cultural level, constantly correct their incorrect ideas and views, and constantly enlighten them so that they have a correct understanding. (7) For the scattered soldiers and vagrants who are stranded on the battlefield, and even ruffians and bandits, we must try to take them in and use propaganda and education methods to persuade them, educate them, and put them on the right track so that they are not used by the Japanese. (8) Cooperate with the people to eliminate traitors and enemy spies. Those who can turn over a new leaf and no longer work for the enemy should be allowed to reform themselves and be exempted from punishment in accordance with the government's self-surrender measures for traitors.

(C) Key Points of Propaganda for the People in the War Zone: In addition to the outline of propaganda for the people of the whole country and the above-mentioned common propaganda points, the following matters must be paid attention to in the propaganda for the people in the war zone: (1) First of all, we must at any time publicize the specific facts of the enemy's atrocities, deception, and conspiracies in order to arouse the people's hatred for the enemy. In particular, we must at any time point out "it is best to use our examples of defeating the enemy to prove" the enemy's crisis and weakness, eliminate the people's fear of the enemy, and encourage the people to help destroy the enemy's transportation, hinder the enemy's political, economic, and cultural facilities, and even participate in guerrilla warfare and fight the enemy. We must publicize and educate the people through practical work. (2) We must awaken the people behind enemy lines and raise their vigilance so that they are not deceived and anesthetized by the enemy. (Zi) Do not attend schools and various training classes run by the enemy and traitors, do not read books, newspapers, and magazines published by the enemy and traitors, and all propaganda materials, and mobilize various religious missionaries to lead their followers in the war zone to resist the enemy's and puppets' missionaries and crush the enemy's and traitors' policy of enslaved education. (Chou) Do not believe the enemy's false propaganda. After understanding the enemy's deceptive propaganda, we should tell others so that they will not be fooled again in order to crush the enemy's anesthesia policy. (Yin) Promote the New Life Movement, ban the smoking of drugs "such as morphine and heroin," prostitution, gambling, etc., in order to crush the enemy's poisoning policy. (3) Publicize the people's air defense and cleanup training and preparations. (4) Help the people build the culture of the war zone, that is, help the people in the garrison to restore and establish schools, set up literacy classes, etc., in order to improve the culture of the war zone, eliminate illiteracy, improve the national consciousness of the people, cultivate and promote the spirit of sacrifice, and complete the mission of national spiritual mobilization. (5) Propagate the increase in production in order to improve the people's lives and increase the power of long-term resistance. Political workers should especially mobilize troops to help the people's production labor in their spare time, thoroughly implement the principle of "service is propaganda," and expand the influence of propaganda. (6) In the propaganda for military service, we should pay attention to the environment of the war zone. In areas where it is not easy to implement conscription, we should encourage the people to volunteer and enlist in the army or join the guerrillas to achieve the purpose of military service propaganda. (7) We should cultivate many young and passionate cadres in propaganda and education to supplement and expand our military and political power in the war zone. (To be continued)

### German Head of State Hitler to Deliver a Speech Today; It Is Generally Expected That He Will Show Off His Propaganda Skills and Present Arguments to Refute Roosevelt's Telegram

(Berlin) Head of State Hitler is scheduled to deliver a speech in the Reichstag at noon tomorrow in response to US President Roosevelt's telegram. All countries around the world are now eagerly awaiting it, and the German people are proud of it. It is generally speculated that when the Head of State speaks, all the arguments that German propaganda is accustomed to using will inevitably be mentioned one by one, such as the usurpation of Germany's old colonies; the fact that the Allied countries have violated the Fourteen Points of the late US President Wilson; Hitler's head has repeatedly proposed to limit armaments, but all the democratic countries have refused; the fact that the democratic countries are colluding with the Bolshevik ideology that destroys everything. In addition, the Head of State may try to explain that Germany has strictly adhered to all the agreements it has signed with other countries, such as the concordat signed between Germany and the Vatican, and the non-aggression pact signed with Poland, which should be used to respond to the outside world's accusations against Germany for violating the Munich Agreement and annexing Czechoslovakia. It is said in political circles that the Head of State may not make any shocking statements, and even the UK's decision to implement conscription will not affect the Head of State's speech. This can be seen in today's afternoon newspapers, which all said that the UK's move is just empty words and wishful thinking. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)

(Berlin) It is reported that Hitler once told an official of the National Socialist Party that when he delivers a speech in the Reichstag on Friday, he will reject all calls for peace. It is said that his reason is that it is an unprecedented event in history for the head of one country to ask the ruler of another country to swear to maintain peace for a long time. According to reports, Roosevelt asked Hitler to swear to maintain peace for at least ten years. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)

(Washington) When Hitler replies to his call for peace on Friday, Roosevelt will be sleeping in bed. Roosevelt will leave Washington tonight. He will arrive at his Hyde Park home when Hitler delivers his speech at 6:00 PM. He does not intend to get up early in the morning to listen to the broadcast of Hitler's speech. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)

(Washington) Diplomatic circles here now believe that if Hitler's speech in the Reichstag tomorrow does not close the door to peace, President Roosevelt will make another peace call to Hitler. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)

(Berlin) Berlin is now hiring many workers to decorate the Grand Theater as the venue for the German Reichstag meeting on the 28th of this month. The large-scale decorations celebrating Hitler's birthday a few days ago will welcome Hitler as he drives from the Head of State's residence to the Grand Theater. However, there will be very few pedestrians along the way. The workers in the factories, the students in the schools, and the employees of the shops will all follow the orders of Propaganda Minister Goebbels and gather beside the wireless electric machine to quietly listen to Hitler's speech. General Goering will announce the opening of the meeting in his capacity as Speaker of the Reichstag, and then Hitler will stand up and speak. It is reported that Hitler is scheduled to speak during the day so that his speech and the official reactions to his speech in the capitals of various countries can be published in the morning world newspapers. A Reuters reporter heard from official circles that Hitler has now drafted his speech, in which he will publish Germany's reply to the UK's implementation of compulsory military service. Today, most of the newspapers here criticized the UK's decision to implement compulsory military service. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)

### The UK Notifies the Four Powers Separately About the Implementation of Conscription

(London) Ambassador to Germany Henderson visited German Deputy Foreign Minister Weizsäcker today to inform him that his country fully supports President Roosevelt's call and has decided to implement conscription and promote the new policy with the greatest determination. In addition, the government has not only notified the governments of the United States, France, and Italy separately about the decision to implement conscription, but has also informed the autonomous territories. According to responsible sources, the government has taken all appropriate measures to ensure that "the Military Training Bill can be implemented within two or three days after it is voted on by the parliament. (Havas dispatch on the 26th) After the British cabinet suddenly decided to implement conscription, German political figures were deeply impressed because they did not expect it to be so fast, but they also tried to conceal it, saying that this move was only a "gesture" and did not need to be taken too seriously. The outline of Germany's foreign policy, as well as the content of the speech to be delivered by Hitler on the 28th of this month, will not be changed as a result. The German national character has always been strong and decisive, and will never be shaken by it. In addition, the Hamburg Foreign Review reported that the fact that British Prime Minister Chamberlain has broken the country's traditional spirit shows that the influence exerted on the world by all the omnipotent countries is quite significant. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)

(Rome) British Chargé d'affaires Sir Charles visited Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon to solemnly inform him that his country has decided to implement conscription. Political figures here commented that the UK's move may not be effective. The country's army lacks staff officers and will remain insignificant in the coming years. If a war breaks out at this time, the current balance of power in Europe will not be changed as a result. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)

### German Foreign Minister Avoids Meeting with the British Ambassador; British Labor Party Members Suspect It Is an Insult

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that the government had not instructed Ambassador Henderson to Germany to submit any suggestions or proposals to the German government. We believe that in the current environment, Henderson should remain in his post and inform Germany of the developments in British foreign policy at any time. A member asked if Henderson would meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop before Hitler's speech on Friday. The Prime Minister replied that Henderson had been received by German State Councillor Weizsäcker this morning. Although a meeting with Ribbentrop could not be scheduled at the moment, Henderson would find a way to meet with Ribbentrop at any time in the future. Labor Party member Belenji then spoke, implying rumors that the German Foreign Minister could not meet with Henderson because he did not have time, and asked if this situation was a direct insult to the British ambassador. The Prime Minister replied that there was no need to make such speculation. According to what he had heard, the German Foreign Minister was busy because the Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković was visiting Berlin. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)

### Hitler Takes His Time; On the Eve of Delivering His Speech, He Watches the Miss America Dance

(Berlin) Hitler stopped his work on preparing his speech last night and went to the Metro Pole Theater to watch a musical comedy performed by the famous American dancer Miss Verna. According to reports, Miss Verna was summoned to the Prime Minister's private residence for a performance a few weeks ago. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels also invited her to perform when he entertained guests. It was decided that when Hitler went to the theater to visit, he only had a small number of guards to protect him, and the theater authorities were not notified in advance. (Associated Press dispatch on the 27th)

### The British Government's Military Training Bill Is Submitted to the House of Commons for Discussion; The Prime Minister Strongly Argues That the Times Are Critical and Urges Speedy Passage

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain introduced a motion to welcome compulsory military service in the House of Commons today, and mentioned consulting with other parties, stating that the government did not want to keep them in the dark. He continued that the government was doing this under pressure and did not have time to consult in detail. If this resolution is delayed until next week, it will be considered to be related to Hitler's speech tomorrow. The Prime Minister replied to a question from opposition leader Attlee, saying that he believed that this matter was of utmost importance to the country, so the House of Commons should vote tonight. The House of Commons could hold a debate on the second reading of the bill next week. The full text of the bill will be published early next week. The Prime Minister and the Destructive Argument section cited his previous remarks on the issue of conscription and said, "The situation in two of these things is very different from today. Neither of them had the war looming large, and at that time, no one had in mind a problem that seemed to be leading to war. Today, we no longer believe that the needs of the country can be met by the voluntary system. If we do not assess the situation and change our previous views, then there is nothing more likely to lead the country to disaster than this. To say that we cannot change our previous views is tantamount to saying that we cannot take a plan to protect the country unless we hold a general election. Now the situation is very urgent, so the government has no other way but to implement compulsory military service." (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)

### Chamberlain Explains Key Points of Two Bills: Government Given Full Authority for Three Years

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that, while we have made great efforts in military preparations, nothing makes the world feel that our country has the determination to resist aggression more than our acceptance of the principle of compulsory military service.

The Prime Minister announced the government's new conscription plan, stating that the government will propose two bills. One is to allow various military service departments to call up any level or type of reserve and auxiliary forces. The main points of the other bill are: (1) the power to call up all men between the ages of twenty and twenty-one for military training; (2) this training will only be given in Great Britain, but in the event of war, the responsibility of serving overseas will be uniformly applied; (3) the men called up will first receive six months of military training, after which they will be discharged, but if they are willing, they may join the National Defense Volunteer Force for three and a half years, during which time they may be called up to perform the normal duties of a volunteer soldier, or be called up and transferred to the special reserve of the regular army; (4) provisions will be made to allow individuals to state valid reasons for being called up for training a few days earlier or later, depending on the circumstances of the country at the time; (5) provisions will be made so that conscientious objectors may be exempted from military service by the conscription tribunal, provided that they undertake work of significant benefit to the country in lieu of military service.

The Prime Minister explained to the House of Commons the government's reasons for implementing conscription, saying that this system is already widely implemented in Europe. The voluntary system has a clear weakness, namely that people are busy seeking pleasure or profit while their neighbors are focusing on training for war. In times of war, military service will immediately become compulsory, which is already understood and accepted by the general public. The Prime Minister continued, saying that until now, he did not believe it was necessary to implement such a plan in peacetime. He reiterated the promise he made to Lord Baldwin (former Prime Minister), that he would never propose compulsory military service in peacetime during the life of this Parliament. We are not currently facing war, but the belief in maintaining peace has been destroyed as countries exhaust all their resources for war preparations. Everyone knows that if war comes, our entry into the war will be a matter of hours, not weeks. No one dares to say that today is still peacetime and can properly use this term to describe it. According to the bill, in times of unrest, it is necessary to call up certain volunteer forces and regular army personnel to strengthen our national air defense system. This extreme period may last a long time. This will cause those called up in the volunteer army to make a greater and longer sacrifice than they expected when they volunteered. The government has decided that it is currently necessary to implement compulsory military training to cope with the new special situation. When I say "currently," I want to clearly state that the government's proposal will be included in the second bill, named the Military Training Bill, and will be temporary in nature.

The Prime Minister continued that the powers granted to the government by the two bills will be for a period of three years, which can be terminated by the cabinet if the situation changes. However, at the end of the three-year period, it can also be extended for one year, provided that a definite resolution is passed by both houses. (Reuter, 26th)

### British Labor Groups Joint Meeting Passes Labor Party Amendment

Expresses Regret Over Government Actions - Executive Committee of the Trades Union Congress, Executive Committee of the National Labor Party, and Executive Committee of the Parliamentary Labor Party held a joint meeting today and unanimously passed the amendment proposed by the Labor Party in the House of Commons, expressing regret over the government's abandonment of the principle of voluntary conscription, and stating that compulsory conscription is ill-considered. The National Labor Council will meet on May 1 to consider its position based on the situation of today's debate in the House of Commons. (Reuter, 27th)

### London Air Defense Forces Ordered to Emergency Readiness to Cope with Crisis Within 24 Hours

(London) Today, British Prime Minister Chamberlain strongly urged Parliament to quickly pass the conscription bill because "no one can claim this is a time of peace." The bill will allow Britain to conscript 300,000 young men into the army each year. Chamberlain hopes to pass the bill in the House of Commons before nightfall. This move comes on the eve of Hitler's speech and is a warning to Hitler, indicating that Britain is prepared to join the war if necessary. The British government has issued an emergency order to prevent unexpected events, instructing all national anti-aircraft gun teams to prepare for a crisis within 24 hours. The British military spent all night last night preparing to replenish the strength of the national air defense gun teams, which will first include the 20-year-old conscripts. Chamberlain announced that Britain had to call up national defense guard members and non-regular air force personnel to reinforce the national air defense gun teams. This precautionary measure was taken afterward, similar to the measures taken during the crisis last September. Yesterday, hundreds of people gathered at conscription offices in London, preparing to enlist. The conscription of 20-year-olds ended at midnight. At 3 a.m., doctors were specially called to examine the physical condition of those enlisting. The auxiliary forces of the air force, including lookouts, defense balloons, searchlights, and anti-aircraft gun teams, were ordered to guard key locations in London and along the coast to watch for enemy aircraft. There are a total of 14,000 lookouts nationwide. The auxiliary air force currently has twenty flying squadrons, mostly fighter squadrons. There are ten defense balloon teams near London. The government's move is intended to make the public believe in the necessity of conscription. (Associated Press, 27th)

### Canada to Train Air Force Personnel for Britain - Agreement Reached

Ottawa - Canadian Defense Minister Mackenzie stated in the House of Commons today that the British and Canadian governments have now concluded a three-year plan to train air force pilots in Canada. Britain will send 50 students and pilots to Canada each year. (Reuter, 26th)

### Italian Cabinet to Meet Tomorrow

(Rome) Mussolini has summoned cabinet members to meet on Saturday morning. (Reuter, 26th)

### Romania Will Not Fall into Germany's Embrace - Close Relations Between Britain and Romania - Gafencu Arrives in France for Talks

(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, after completing his visit to London, issued a communique stating that the talks were extremely frank and sincere, and focused on the general common outlook on current issues between the two governments. (Reuter, 16th)

(London) Well-informed political sources here recently declared that after the Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's talks with the British authorities in recent days, relations between Britain and Romania have become closer, and the possibility of Romania falling into Germany's embrace has completely disappeared. Economically, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's economic advisor, is currently in the Romanian capital negotiating an agreement with the Romanian authorities. Once the agreement is reached, Romania will be economically and financially free from the control of Germany and Italy. Politically, the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Poland has had a significant impact on the talks between the British and Romanian authorities. It is reported that the Soviet government no longer insists on revising the current guarantee treaties of the Baltic countries to explicitly target Germany. At the same time, the British government will also instruct its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, to urge the Soviet Union to provide a guarantee that if any neighboring countries are invaded and seek assistance from the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will provide assistance to the extent specified by the invaded country. In addition, the issue of cooperation between Romania and Turkey is also one of the goals of the talks between the British and Romanian authorities. Regarding this, it is expected that significant progress will be made after Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin's visit to the Turkish capital. (Havas, 26th)

(Paris) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here from London at 11 p.m. tonight. Foreign Minister Bonnet, the Romanian Ambassador Tataresco, and many dignitaries welcomed him at the station. Foreign Minister Gafencu is scheduled to return home with Premier Daladier via Rome and the Yugoslav capital on the 29th of this month. According to responsible sources here, Foreign Minister Gafencu will inform the French authorities of the talks he had with the authorities of Poland, Germany, Belgium, and Britain during his visits, and will conduct talks with them on various issues related to France and Romania, as well as the general international situation. To this day, the harmony of Franco-Romanian relations is unprecedented, and both sides can frankly exchange views. (Havas, 26th)

### British Implementation of Compulsory Military Service - French Diplomatic Victory - French and American Public Opinion Express Satisfaction

(Paris) French political circles today expressed congratulations on Britain's determination to implement conscription, and recognized this as a diplomatic victory for French Prime Minister Daladier. The entire French nation today was deeply pleased that Britain's announcement gave Hitler a real message. According to military experts here, if the British conscription system is completed, the military strength of Britain and France will be around 10,000,000. (Associated Press, 27th)

(Paris) After the British cabinet decided to implement conscription, French officials expressed great satisfaction, saying that this was an unprecedented initiative in British history. In recent years, countries in Europe whose sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity have been threatened have been automatically guaranteed by Britain. This decision to implement conscription shows Britain's determination to fulfill its commitments. (Havas, 26th)

(Paris) "Le Débat" titled "A Very Significant Event," which is a typical attitude of the French nation towards British Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement of conscription. "Le Temps" stated that today's decision and yesterday's budget speech mean that Britain is placing the full weight of its moral and material strength in the balance to face the situation and faithfully fulfill its national and international responsibilities. Germany would make a big mistake if it considered British conscription a provocation, as Germany has destroyed the spirit and letter of the treaties and resumed national military power. (Reuter, 26th)

(Washington) After Britain decided to implement conscription, people from all walks of life in the United States expressed satisfaction, saying that if the Axis powers attempt to change the European status quo by force in the future, Britain has decided to resist by all means. This is evidenced by the country's implementation of conscription. This move is also a sign that Britain has effectively abandoned the "Munich policy." The security guarantees recently provided by Britain and France to the small countries of Europe will also be more trusted by these small countries. (Havas, 26th)

(Washington) There is no criticism here of Britain's implementation of conscription. Most people will wait to see how the British constituencies and dominions react before commenting. It is generally believed that Chamberlain's justification for implementing conscription in what is not "peacetime" will undoubtedly be seen as contrary to his efforts to ensure equal sacrifices from all classes. Recently, American newspapers have strongly criticized Britain for making improper profits through military buildup and air defense work. The US Congress is now using various plans to prevent "profiting from war" and advocates conscripting funds and manpower during wartime. The general public believes that the British will demand the implementation of plans similar to those in the United States in order to achieve equality. (Reuter, 26th)

### German Newspapers Mock Britain - Talking on Paper

(Berlin) The British government's decision to implement conscription has been commented on by various newspapers here, with varying opinions. Some ridicule the move, saying that it is temporary in nature and its effectiveness remains to be seen. Others see it as part of Britain's encirclement policy and therefore feel uneasy. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung stated, "The British conscription system is only of interest to military experts and is not worth discussing in depth. But it has its own political significance, which Prime Minister Chamberlain has explained frankly. In other words, Britain's implementation of conscription is a diplomatic tool, intended to force small countries to join the encirclement policy, and that is all." The Lokalanzeiger stated, "Britain's move is a political action, intended to incite small countries to join the encirclement policy. The international situation is precarious, and people are afraid of war. British agitators cannot shirk their responsibility." (Havas, 27th)

(Berlin) Last night, Berlin newspapers carried lengthy reports and comments on Britain's implementation of compulsory military service, stating that Britain's motive for taking this step was twofold: first, to put pressure on Berlin on the eve of Chancellor Hitler's speech to the Reichstag, and second, to give the small countries of Europe an impression to strengthen their trust in Britain. The "Berliner Nachtausgabe" said, "The various diplomatic and military measures recently taken by the 'encirclement countries' have not made a deep impression on Germany. Germany will continue to pursue its established policy of 'seeking indispensable living space for Germany,' regardless of the strategy of the countries opposed to the Axis." (Haitong, 27th)

### Deep Impression in Rome

(Rome) Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration on conscription has had a significant psychological impact on Italian political figures, who see it as an "internal revolution" in British politics. The British Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Noel Charles, visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano this morning to inform him of Britain's decision. Because Britain gave advance notice of this decision to Berlin and Rome, everyone feels greatly satisfied. Military figures believe that this conscription plan is a major increase in the strength of the Anglo-French bloc. (Reuter, 26th)

(Rome) The official Italian impression of Britain's implementation of compulsory conscription is very deep. According to Italian officials last night, this move by Britain is in preparation for taking a firm stand and making no further concessions to the totalitarian states. At the same time, the evening newspapers here stated that Britain's decision to adopt conscription legislation may be the result of French pressure. The wording of the newspapers attempts to give the general impression that the government's move has not received the support of the people. (Haitong, 27th)

### A Glimpse of Eastern Newspaper Comments

(Tokyo) The British government's decision to implement compulsory military service has attracted widespread attention here. The Japan Broadcaster stated that Britain's determination to cope with the current crisis in Europe is being expressed daily. The most surprising thing is the introduction of the Compulsory Military Service Bill in Parliament, as a warning to Hitler before his speech on April 28 that any further harm to European peace will be met with determined resistance. The Asahi Shimbun stated that this decision by Britain will cause a major reaction in Europe. However, it is doubtful how effective hundreds of thousands of troops can be after only a few months of training. Britain made this move at the request of France, and France will definitely gain some comfort from it. However, Britain's decision comes before Hitler's speech, and the situation may become more serious as a result. The Hochi Shimbun stated that this decision by Britain will not ease the European situation, but will only make it more serious. This is an indication of an offensive against Germany and Italy, which will stimulate the Axis powers. Britain obviously wants to ease Hitler's speech on April 28, but it is feared that it will backfire, and the rift between the Axis powers and the democracies will deepen from now on. Britain is encircling Germany and now implementing compulsory military service, and cannot be regarded as a peace-loving country. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Germany, even if it loves peace, cannot negotiate peace with Britain unless Britain abandons its intimidating behavior, because Britain is now intimidating Germany with compulsory military service and encirclement policies. If Britain does not abandon its hostility towards Germany and show its sincerity in seeking peace, the European crisis cannot be eliminated. (Reuter, 26th)

### Japan Has No Spare Capacity to Help the Axis Powers in War - The Entire Nation Opposes Military Alliance with Germany and Italy

(London) The Times' Tokyo correspondent stated that no matter what Hitler says in his speech on the 28th, he cannot claim that Japan will fight for the Axis powers in the Pacific. The entire Japanese nation, except for the military, opposes a military alliance with Germany and Italy. The majority of cabinet members also hold this view. The fact that a bill not allowing the strengthening of Axis relations was formally introduced in the Diet shows this. The proponents of an alliance with Germany and Italy are mainly the army, and the attitude of the Japanese army is influenced by the troops in China. This faction believes that all the difficulties encountered in the war against China are due to British aid to China. As for the navy, it is difficult to support a policy that would cause the navies of various countries to join the Soviet Union in confronting Japan. (27th)

### Japanese Army Minister Itagaki Meets with Hiranuma to Exchange Views on the European Situation

(Tokyo) Army Minister Itagaki met with Hiranuma at the Prime Minister's residence today to exchange views on the European situation based on information received here. (Reuter, 26th)

### Chao-Shan Emergency Evacuation of Population

### Completed Within Three Days Starting on the 19th

### Military and Police Deployed Along the Coast to Prepare for the Enemy

Shantou Correspondence: The Chao-Shan authorities convened a meeting of representatives from various sectors on the 19th and set a three-day deadline for the emergency evacuation of the population. When this news spread, various businesses telegraphed Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other ports to stop distributing goods. Some medicinal herb shops, seeing the shortage of seasoned medicines in Chaozhou and Meizhou and fearing that Chao-Shan would be blockaded by Japanese warships, making it impossible to treat patients in the interior, specially sent partners to Hong Kong to search for medicines produced in Yunnan, regardless of the price, to snap them up and store them in the interior.

The Chao-Shan Railway Company opened up trains all night starting on the evening of the 19th to transport the population. The Garrison Headquarters also earnestly implemented the evacuation measures. The populations of Chao'an, Chenghai, and Raoping counties gradually moved upstream to Meizhou starting on the 10th. The boats and vehicles that had been requisitioned for military use were released as much as possible to provide transportation. The provincial government has telegraphed Zhou Jingzhen, the administrative commissioner of the Sixth District, instructing him to notify the counties of Meizhou that when the evacuated people arrive, each village should set up inquiry stations to provide tea and water or temporary overnight accommodation, and strictly prohibit raising house rents and prices. Any officials who dare to take the opportunity to exploit and profit will be charged with profiteering from national crisis and executed without mercy. Starting on the evening of the 19th, the population began to move upstream. The military and police jointly launched a major curfew in the coastal suburbs. Only able-bodied men who were not allowed to evacuate were left in the coastal villages. Large inland armies (including artillery) appeared along the coast starting on the 20th, practicing shooting and guarding the newly completed fortifications day and night, assisting in maintaining local order. This evacuation of the population is a necessary strategic action to strike at the enemy. Chao'an, Shantou, Chenghai, and Raoping counties and cities are executing it simultaneously. At least one million people will be evacuated.

Shantou City's emergency evacuation of the population must be completed within three days. The evacuation measures are as follows: (A) Population Migration: (1) All elderly, weak, women, and children over 60 years old and under 15 years old, and unemployed vagrants in the city must be evacuated within three days, by the 23rd. (2) The police bureau will immediately send police to persuade households door-to-door. The town and Baojia chiefs will earnestly assist in persuading evacuation. (3) Those who cannot evacuate due to economic hardship or other reasons will be investigated and coordinated by the police bureau. (4) Impoverished children will be investigated by the police bureau and reported to the Guangdong Children's Welfare Association by the garrison headquarters, who will send personnel to Shantou to take them in, bring them to the orphanage, and raise them. (5) All levels of schools must move to the interior within three days. The city government will set detailed measures separately. Evacuated students are requested to be allowed by the city government to be admitted to various primary and secondary schools in the interior to join classes. (6) Children who fail to evacuate after the deadline will be forcibly taken in by personnel sent by the garrison headquarters. After the evacuation, residents remaining in the city should prepare to form teams to assist the military and police in combat and be determined to fight the enemy to the death, and must not move freely. (B) Material Migration: (1) All large and small shops, market goods, funds, and large and small factories must be moved to the interior within three days. Those that cannot be moved (electricity, tap water) may be requested to be moved and kept by the government and be subject to government control. (2) The principle of factories and market goods is to move to the interior and must not be moved abroad or to occupied areas. (3) Factories and materials that cannot be dismantled or are unwilling to move will be the responsibility of the chamber of commerce to convene representatives of various guilds to discuss the results, list them, and report them to the garrison headquarters, which will telegraphed the China Industrial Cooperative Society to send engineers to Shantou to dismantle, move, and manage them. (4) The 100,000 bags of rice currently stored in the city will be telegraphed by the garrison headquarters to the counties of Meipu to quickly come to Shantou to purchase as much as possible, and instruct rice merchants to leave 2 million catties within three days for the city to use for one month in response to the war. The rest will be transported to the interior. Rice merchants must continue to procure rice and transport it to the interior within one week after import. (5) All banks should disperse to borrow money according to previous plans. (6) During the evacuation period, the customs and tax bureaus and various relevant agencies should handle all material and mechanical certification procedures for merchants moving day and night. (7) If various guilds need to convene meetings on material evacuation, they should speed up the meeting results and not delay the time. The above are resolutions that the authorities forcibly implemented. In recent days, the highways have been destroyed for the second time. The Chao'an, Jieyang, and Fengshun avenues will definitely be bombed by the end of this month and will no longer be open to traffic.

### Tragic Situation of Japanese Aircraft Bombing Hengyang

### Most of the Urban Area Was Burned Down

### Even the Wounded Soldiers' Hospital Was Damaged by Bombing

The Zi Lin Bao reported that Mrs. Kilpatrick of Shanghai recently received a letter from her husband, Pastor Kilpatrick, from Hengyang, Hunan. The letter stated that on April 6, Hengyang was attacked from the air. Around 10:00 AM, the first air raid siren sounded. The Chinese people rushed into the church buildings and took refuge in the air raid shelters that had been dug shortly after the military uprising. They did not appear to be particularly alarmed. After circling in the sky over the city for a few minutes, a team disappeared quietly. After this siren, at 11:00, a Japanese plane flew in from the east and reconnoitered the city, but also did not drop a bomb and left. But soon, the buzzing sound of planes was heard, and 18 bombers were seen flying towards the city. The people in the houses of the city had not yet had time to return to the air raid shelters when the sound of bombs exploding was heard. Japanese planes dropped bombs in this undefended city, and the hissing sound of the bombs falling could be heard. Many bombs fell nearby, causing a terrible shock. After each plane dropped all of its bombs, it circled the burning city once and left. Kilpatrick knew that some bombs must have hit nearby. As soon as the sound of the planes gradually faded, he immediately left the air raid shelter. At the door, he met two Chinese women covered in dust and almost unrecognizable. They told him that a house where several people were taking refuge had been hit twice. Kilpatrick and two other foreigners rushed to the site and saw that although the walls had not collapsed, the roof was completely destroyed, and they faintly heard shouts coming from inside the house. At first, they did not know where the shouts were coming from, but then they saw a hand waving from the rubble, and they realized that it was leading to the cellar, where several people were taking refuge. The rescuers removed the rubble and rescued one Chinese person who was crushed inside. Fortunately, he was not seriously injured. Another Chinese person had his right arm and left leg struck by falling timber and was carried to the hospital after being rescued. He died the next day. At that time, fires broke out in the city, and thick smoke filled the air. The missionaries expected that most of Hengyang would be in the fire. Further investigation revealed that most of the commercial buildings along the telegraph station and post office, as well as a Chinese hospital with wounded soldiers, were all destroyed. The hospital had a Red Cross flag clearly marked. Few of the people in the hospital escaped, and the rest were buried in the fire. The 15-minute air raid turned a prosperous city into a huge pile of rubble.

### The Silkworm Cocoons of Jiangnan Were All Seized

### Controlled by the "Central China Company"

Suzhou Correspondence: Now is the height of the spring silkworm season. The villagers in the counties of Wuxi and Chengxiang have always regarded sericulture as a major sideline industry in rural areas. Driven by profit, many people raise silkworms. However, it is all controlled by the Japanese "Central China Company." It is estimated that more than 200,000 freshly hatched silkworms have been distributed. The silkworms have now reached the first sleep stage. The "Central China Company" is actively preparing for the cocoon harvest. Based on current weather forecasts, a bumper cocoon harvest is expected. There are more than 100 cocoon shops in the counties of Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiangyin, Danyang, Jintan, Dantu, Jurong, and Yixing that have signed contracts, all of which are controlled by the "Central China Company" in Wuxi for cocoon collection. Wuxian, Changshu, Wujiang, and other counties are managed by the "Central China Company" in Suzhou. The silkworm cocoons of Jiangnan were all seized, which is very distressing.

### Chinese Army in Gaoyou Recovers Hehuatang

### Chinese Army in Yiling Attacks Fairy Temple

Taixian Correspondence: The military strength, heavy artillery, and other military equipment of the Japanese army entrenched in the Huai River area are now being moved to Xuzhou, and the fortifications they have built are being automatically destroyed. Their intentions are unclear, and it seems that they intend to abandon them.

The Wang Brigade of the Chinese Army in Gaoyou has recovered Hehuatang. On the morning of the 18th, a battalion of the Chinese Army in Yiling was ordered to lead a team to attack the Japanese army in Fairy Temple. They engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army for several hours in the areas of Doutian Temple, Jiangjia Bridge, and Wenchang Palace in the southeast of the town. The Japanese army was accustomed to shooting with machine guns and firing artillery to show their power, consuming a lot of ammunition. The Chinese army, believing that the task of consuming the Japanese strength had been achieved, safely returned to their defenses. The Japanese army has recently completed the construction of the highway from Zhaoguan Dam to the front of Shaobo to facilitate the reinforcement and delivery of grain when the Chinese army launches a general counterattack. However, the Chinese army has been launching fierce attacks and bravely advancing day and night, and has also launched surprise attacks from hidden locations on the flanks, and has destroyed part of the newly built highway. The Japanese army feared that their retreat would be cut off, so they urgently retreated to the strongholds south of Zhaoguan Dam to defend. The two sides are currently in a stalemate.

### Fierce Fighting in Yeshe and Songyin

### Two Traitors Beheaded

Jinshan Correspondence: After the Chinese army's Yuan Yingjie unit reorganized the guerrillas in the Tianma Mountain area and received a large number of new weapons, they were led by Cai Xiren, the administrative commissioner of the Fourth District of Jiangsu Province, to launch a large-scale encirclement of the Japanese army in the Yeshe, Songyin, Ganxiang, and Zhangze areas. Yuan Yingjie led a death squad of 100 men to directly attack the rear of the Japanese army. Fierce fighting took place along the entire line for three days and nights. Many were captured. In all areas of Jinshan Tong, Luxiang Zhongdai, and Xincang, the Japanese army forced the chairman of the Zhongdai Maintenance Association, Mr. Yu, and Gu, a fake staff member of the Jinshan pseudo-county government, to force the people to rush to build highways day and night. However, after the highways were built, they were destroyed by the Chinese army's plainclothes teams. Yu and Gu were also captured by the Chinese army and beheaded. Recently, there has been fierce fighting in Qiaoxingta, Qianjiawei, and Hougang. More than 1,000 regular troops have also been opened to Luxiang.

(B) "Promoting Public Schools": Since 1936, each county and city must increase the number of public schools by 20 to 40 each year. Each school enrolls two terms per year, with two classes per term and 50 students per class. On average, each county can train 6,000 out-of-school people, calculated by 30 schools. The whole country can train 12 million people with 2,000 cities and counties. If it increases year by year, it is expected to complete the initial popularization work in six years. As a result of the implementation in 1936, 12 million illiterate people have been eliminated.

### Sports News from Hong Kong

— Sent by Nan Yan from Hong Kong

(1) When Zhang Rongcai first came to Hong Kong, he was very lucky. Later, he followed the South China Athletic Association to Saigon for a trip, and he became very popular. South China's strategist Mo Qing even said: "Zhang is better than Bao Jiaping and Tan Junqian." However, Zhang Rongcai is indeed a hard worker. He has shown some skills in low-level balls, and he does have his strengths. Perhaps because he was too excited, or because he was too tired from playing too many games, he performed disappointingly for a long period after returning to Hong Kong. Fortunately, this was a feverish illness, and he is slowly recovering to his normal state now.

(2) Luo Douwen has recently suffered a "fall" in the South China Athletic Association. When fighting Xinghua, he once used Yang Shuiyi, who used to kick the stone wing. This is a matter of losing face, and of course there are some tricks in it. However, in fact, Yang Shuiyi is not better than Luo Douwen, and this cannot be hidden from the Hong Kong fans. However, I must also say that Luo Douwen also has some faults. It is true that he is afraid to work hard. He is always shrinking back, as if he advocates doing less is better than doing more. When grabbing the ball, he lacks a bit of energy, which makes people feel uncomfortable. In short, the biggest problem is that he drags his feet when dribbling, and he lacks some of the strength that a man should have when attacking.

For a while, even people who watched it were anxious for him, and they advised his beloved wife to return to Shanghai earlier, so as not to create obstacles to training. However, his "wife" did not agree, and the diplomacy was not settled, so it was over. Later, his "wife" felt that some situations were not optimistic, so she had to endure the pain of separation. Now, of course, it depends on how the "husband" is doing.

(3) South China made a lot of money on their trip to Annam. The Eastern Athletic Association saw that the situation was still good, measured their strength, and thought that their reputation was also good, so they pulled together a few people and decided to take a trip as well. Chen Fuyu seems to be doing very well, serving as the leader, and Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting are playing key roles. As of now, they have played a total of four games, resulting in three wins and one draw, which is enough face. However, there is an extra Zhang Jinhai in Chen Rongli. According to the itinerary, it will take Zhang Jinhai almost mid-April to get from Chongqing to Haiphong at the earliest, and there is obviously something mysterious about this. Zhang Rongcai said: This is not the real Zhang Jinhai, but a Mr. Jin who was invited from St. Joseph's in Hong Kong. Fortunately, the Annamese don't recognize him, so let him do whatever he wants.

Zhong Yongsen has also gone, and the Eastern Athletic Association is happy to be a "foreigner" in the market. (To be continued)

### Customs Statistics Show - Western Countries' Trade with China Plummets - Japan's Exports to China Increase Fourfold - German and Italian Commerce Suffers Similarly

According to the Continental Daily News, the latest customs statistics reveal that the trade of Western countries with China has suddenly fallen to a level unprecedented in modern commercial history, while Japan has received a rich reward after blocking the gates in the occupied areas. Although the Japanese government firmly denies that the trade restriction regulations implemented in the occupied areas are intended to discriminate against foreign merchants, the customs statistics for the first three months of this year show that the goods imported into China by major countries have fallen even more than the figures for the same period last year, which were affected by the war, while Japan's exports to China have increased more than fourfold. Japan's colonies' exports to China have also reached this proportion. Japan's exports to China, which openly boycotted its goods, were 16,931,000 yuan in the first three months of last year, and 71,388,000 yuan in the same period this year. In contrast, the United Kingdom's exports to China have fallen sharply.

The figures for January to March last year were 22,251,000 yuan, which fell to 15,549,000 yuan in the same period this year. Only the increase in trade between China and the British Commonwealth and colonies restored the advantage of British trade in China. From January to March last year, Australia, British East and West Africa, India, Siam, Canada, Ceylon, Egypt, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom's exports to China totaled 34,122,000 yuan, and in the same period this year, they were 52,462,000 yuan. The two other "axis" countries, Germany and Italy, were most severely affected by the Japanese restrictions. This is quite noteworthy. In the first three months of last year, Germany's exports to China were worth 45,184,000 yuan, while in the same period this year, they were only 18,323,000 yuan. Italy suffered even more, falling from 13,684,000 yuan in the first three months of last year to 1,847,000 yuan in the same period this year. The most prominent feature in the statistics is the sharp increase in China's exports. In the first three months of this year, the total was 194,583,000 yuan, an increase of 60,125,000 yuan over the same period last year. As a result of this sharp increase, the import surplus has been reduced from 95,812,000 yuan in the first three months of last year to 79,856,000 yuan in the same period this year.

### Unemployed Japanese Man, Inoue, Commits Seppuku at the Public Works Department - But Does Not Achieve His Goal and His Injury Improves - No Explanation for the "Glorious Sacrifice"

According to the Continental Daily News, Inoue, an unemployed Japanese man, 35 years old, entered the Public Works Department building at 11:50 AM yesterday (the 26th), wandered in the corridor for several minutes, did not attempt to meet with anyone, and then at the escalator entrance of the Finance Department on the second floor, pulled out a seppuku dagger, intending to cut open his stomach. Although he bled a lot, he was not seriously injured. He was rushed to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road by a fire brigade ambulance. Last night, it was heard that his injury had improved greatly and he is expected to recover soon. According to what the police detectives of the Police Department were able to confirm before the Japanese authorities handled the case, Inoue came to Shanghai from Japan ten days ago and lived at No. 441 Peng Road. It was heard that he came to Shanghai to seek work, but every application was unsuccessful. This time, he attempted seppuku, and he did not mention the reason, but many believe that he was forced to do so by economic difficulties. Yesterday, it was claimed that this case was not ordinary, because seppuku is considered in Japan to be a glorious way to eliminate crimes, or a martyrdom of a sacrificed person. However, in Inoue's case, he did not leave a letter, nor did he utter words of motivation. According to Japanese sources last night, Inoue came to Shanghai intending to be a bodyguard for a Chinese puppet. His attempt to end his life was a protest against the Public Works Department's "disloyalty" in handling anti-Japanese activities and the Japanese authorities' "indifferent" attitude toward the Public Works Department.

### After the Shanghai-Ningbo Line Was Closed - Ningbo Suffered Repeated Air Raids - Attempt to Bomb the Old Taiping Steamer Failed - Local Area Was Peaceful, Prices Increased Slightly - No Trace of Japanese Warships on the Zhenhai Waters

The Enderby steamer of the Italian company Zhongyi Steamship Company in this city was approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Authorities to transport American wheat from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 19th. It could have returned to Shanghai immediately, but due to the requests of various parties to transport local products to Shanghai, the Ningbo Garrison Command sent a telegram to the Tenth Army for instructions, and it was approved to transport five kinds of goods, including wine, tin foil, cotton, cotton yarn, and egg products, for export, but passengers were absolutely not allowed. After receiving the order, the ship left Ningbo at 4:00 PM the other day and arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday. It is also learned that the Ningbo Taifeng Factory is now continuing to request the authorities to allow the Enderby steamer to transport wheat to Ningbo a second time, but it has not yet been approved.

No Japanese Warships Outside Zhenhai Estuary. According to Chinese employees of the Enderby steamer, the ship was inspected by Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Estuary on the morning of the 20th while sailing to Ningbo. In addition to asking about nationality and conducting inspections, they also inquired to the Italian shipowner about the preparations of the Chinese army in the territorial waters. The Italian shipowner often replied that it was a military matter and outsiders could not know. The Japanese army had no choice but to let the ship enter the port. It is also learned that a Japanese warship No. 5 sailed into the sea area of Tingshui Gate in Zhenhai on the 21st, and did not stop, but sailed into the Houtou Ferry in Fenghua Port, searching passing civilian ships. The ship did not withdraw from Houtou Ferry until about 11:00 AM, and suddenly fired three cannons at the coast between Hengshanbu and Houtou Ferry. Since then, until the Enderby left Ningbo, there was no news of Japanese warships harassing the area, so the local situation was extremely peaceful. When the ship sailed out of Zhenhai Estuary the other day afternoon, no trace of Japanese warships was found, so the local area was peaceful.

Japanese Planes Repeatedly Flew to Ningbo for Air Raids

It was also reported that Ningbo suddenly discovered three Japanese planes invading the city's airspace at about 10:00 AM on the 25th. The air defense force immediately issued an air raid alarm. After circling several times, the Japanese planes flew to the airspace above the Jiangbei shore and bombed the old Taiping steamer (the ship was reserved to be sunk to blockade Zhenhai Estuary) moored at the China Merchants Bureau dock, dropping a total of five or six bombs. However, most of the bombs fell into the river and did not hit the target. Only one bomb fell on the riverside, and the dock was slightly damaged. There were no deaths or injuries. Also, at 4:00 PM yesterday, the shipping industry in this city received a telegram that Ningbo had another air raid alarm yesterday. The first time was at 8:20 AM and was lifted at 9:40 AM. The second time was at 10:00 AM and was lifted at 11:25 AM. Whether or not bombs were dropped was not mentioned.

Prices Rise During the Suspension of Navigation

Since the Shanghai-Ningbo line was closed, the prices of various commodities in Ningbo have risen due to the disruption of supplies. The average price of silk fabrics and general merchandise has increased by about 25% to 30%. The average price of tea, snacks, and flour has also increased by 20% to 30%. As for rice, due to insufficient reserves, the highest price was 15.6 yuan per dan, and the lowest price was 14 yuan. In order to regulate food supply, the authorities are actively purchasing from Jiangxi Province to clear the source, and 80,000 bags are still being transported to Zhejiang every month. Also, fresh and salted goods have also increased in price due to transportation difficulties. However, the price of bamboo shoots has fallen due to the congestion of goods arriving from various villages and the inability to transport them to Shanghai.

Foreign Oil Tankers Have Been Approved to Enter Ningbo Estuary. Since the Ningbo Estuary was declared closed on the 5th of this month, all ships have been prohibited from entering or leaving. It is now learned that private sailboats have been approved, and those with a pass flag are still allowed to enter or leave the Ningbo Estuary. At the same time, the regular Ningbo route has also been approved, and the Tianbao and Gaodeng steamers have resumed operation. Recently, the three oil companies, Asia, Mobil, and Texaco, have applied for permission for oil tankers to enter the port, and have been approved by the garrison command, still according to the previously promulgated temporary navigation regulations, with Asia granted three times, Mobil three times, and Texaco two times.

### Flag Issue - Under Negotiation

Reply Telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

After the flag dispute occurred in the French Concession of this city, the relevant organizations in this city telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate. The reply telegram is as follows: The French Concession forcibly unloaded, confiscated the national flag, and arrested residents. I have received your telegram. After checking, the ministry has negotiated with the French embassy on this matter, and has been approved to reply that the national flag has been returned, and the arrested residents have also been released, etc. The flag issue is still under negotiation.

### French Ambassador Visits Refugee Area - Praises Highly

More Than 38,000 Refugees Rely on Daily Provisions

French Ambassador Cosme, because of the high praise of Father Jacquinot de Bésange's Nanshi Refugee Zone, wished to see the facilities and living conditions of the refugees in the area. He specially visited yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, accompanied by French Consul General in Shanghai Baudot and two aides. Father Jacquinot and Gu Lun, director of the general office, accompanied them to visit the Chenghuang Temple Main Hall refugee food warehouse, the Yanhai Road First Refugee Hospital, the Wanzhu Street Ci'an Hospital, and more than ten shelters. The ambassador praised the zonal management of the area, which was well-organized, and the emphasis on cleanliness and hygiene in the area. The visit ended at around 11:00 AM. The refugee area is now divided into eight zones for management, with 88 shelters. There are currently more than 38,000 refugees and poor residents relying on the office to provide daily provisions.

### American Donated Wheat for China - Second Batch Will Be Shipped to Shanghai Next Month - Totaling 8,000 Bags

The American Red Cross is continuing to donate the second batch of American wheat, totaling 12,000 bags, to relieve Chinese refugees. It has already been shipped to China by the American ship "Potocki." Among them, 4,000 bags will be donated to Chinese refugees in South China, and the remaining 8,000 bags will be handled by the American Consulate in Shanghai. According to Red Cross sources, the batch of American wheat will arrive in Shanghai in early next month and will be distributed to charitable organizations in various places for the purpose of relieving refugees.

### American 10,000-Ton Cruiser Sailing to Shanghai Tomorrow - Also Coming Is the Flagship of the Asiatic Fleet - Other Ships Will Arrive in Shanghai One After Another

According to the Continental Daily News, the American 10,000-ton cruiser Astoria, which recently carried the ashes of former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito back to Japan, and the flagship of the American Asiatic Fleet, the Augusta, will arrive in Shanghai on Saturday. The Astoria will be berthed at buoys No. 4 and No. 5, where Japanese ships are usually berthed. The Augusta will be berthed at a buoy opposite the Customs Wharf in the middle of the Huangpu River. According to the current plan, the Astoria will arrive in port at around 10:30 AM on Saturday, and will only berth for one day, and will sail to Manila the next morning. The ship's soldiers can go ashore for a tour on Saturday afternoon. The Augusta will stay in Shanghai for several weeks, and then sail to the waters of North China, and is expected to return to Shanghai in late June or early July. Also, Admiral Hart is scheduled to succeed Admiral Yarnell as the commander-in-chief of the American Asiatic Fleet around July 15. Other ships of the Asiatic Fleet, such as destroyers and submarine squadrons, are scheduled to set sail from Manila in late May or early June and arrive in Shanghai.

### Norwegian Ship "Promise" Detained Again: "Prosper" Negotiates for Release, "New Life" Remains Docked in Hong Kong and Not Detained

After Japanese warships arbitrarily inspected and detained merchant ships of various countries, hindering international shipping in China, the ten Portuguese merchant ships, including the "Tangbei," were detained. Despite protests from the Portuguese Consul-General, the Japanese authorities, using the excuse of unclear nationality, delayed their release. Now, the Norwegian merchant ship "Promise," represented by the Pacific Shipping Company, was loaded with 5,000 bags of flour and 140 pieces of general cargo in Shanghai on the 20th of this month and sailed to Fuzhou. The company has not received any telegrams from the shipowner confirming its arrival in Fuzhou. Based on the scheduled voyage, it should have already arrived. Moreover, the company sent telegrams to call for it, but there has been no response. Now, an Associated Press report from Hong Kong confirms that the ship was detained by a Japanese warship en route from Shanghai to Fujian. It is reported that the company will wait for full confirmation of the ship's detention before reporting it to the Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai to negotiate with Japan. Additionally, the Norwegian merchant ship "Prosper," represented by the New Chang'an Company, loaded wood planks and general cargo in Fuzhou on April 18th and sailed to Shanghai. It was detained by a Japanese warship and forced to sail to Taiwan. The company has reported this to the Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai and requested negotiations with the Japanese side. Furthermore, the "New Life" ship, also represented by the New Chang'an Company, is currently docked in Hong Kong, and reports of its detention are inaccurate.

### Rice and Grain Trade Approaching Unification: Improved Market Control, Increased Transaction Volume

Regarding rice prices in Shanghai, since the last sharp increase, transactions among brokers have been extremely chaotic. Some sell directly without going through the market, and others trade privately at prices that do not match the market rate. Consequently, market prices have been inconsistent. The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee believes that if this kind of long-standing problem is not quickly stopped, it will worsen over time, reduce legitimate market transactions, and diminish the effectiveness of management. As a result, regulating the food supply and controlling prices for Shanghai residents will be impossible. They are actively planning sound methods to correct this situation. Since the supervisors led brokers to implement improvements one month ago, market transactions have gradually increased. Although it is difficult to guarantee that direct transactions between brokers are completely eliminated, they have indeed decreased. At the same time, rice industry groups have diligently persuaded individual members to unify prices. Although Shanghai rice prices have fluctuated slightly in recent days, the amount is very small. This is related to the quantity of supplies from inland areas and the amount of sales, but it has no impact on the overall rice market.

### Chinese Military Authorities Officially Deny: Ji Xingwen Has Not Died and Is Not in Shanghai, but Still Commanding at the Front

A Reuters report from Chongqing on the 27th stated that Chinese military authorities here officially deny the news of Ji Xingwen's death in Shanghai. They stated that Ji Xingwen is neither in Shanghai nor ill, but is commanding troops at the front.

### Puppet "Ministry of Transportation" Covets All Property Rights of the Dredging Bureau: Recently Requested Takeover from Japan, Awaiting Response from Various Countries

The Shanghai Dredging Bureau, an international organization, has been completely paralyzed since the end of the year before last, when the Japanese side towed away more than 30 dredging vessels and survey boats, including the "Jianshe Hailong," "Haihu," and "Haibao." All dredging work on the Huangpu River has been completely suspended for 17 months, leading to the accumulation of sediment on the riverbed, which has significantly affected shipping. Since the establishment of the puppet "Maritime Administration Bureau" by the puppet "Reformed Government Ministry of Transportation" on North Sichuan Road in Hongkou, in addition to issuing a false "proclamation" in an attempt to lure foreign ships to register, it has recently turned to Japan and requested to take over all movable and immovable property of the Dredging Bureau, control the Huangpu River dredging work, and assign the position of engineer in the bureau to a Japanese person. It is rumored that the Japanese side has agreed to this principle and is awaiting consultations on the details of the takeover. It is now awaiting responses from various countries. If no one comes forward to oppose it, the ownership and work of the Dredging Bureau will soon fall into the hands of the puppets.

### Indian Prince Departs Shanghai Yesterday: Continues World Tour

Prince Kapurthala of India, the second wealthiest man in the world, and his son, who are on a world tour, arrived in Shanghai on the Italian mail ship "Baika Meno" on Tuesday. They were received by Clayton of the British Consulate and are currently staying at the Cathay Hotel. It is learned that the Indian prince left Shanghai yesterday to continue his voyage. Prince Kapurthala visited Shanghai once 35 years ago and this is his second visit. He rules over 650 square miles in India with a population of approximately 300,000.

### Trade Association Urges All Industries to Handle Commissions

The Trade Association of the Refugee Relief Association, recognizing that there are more than 300 trade associations in Shanghai, but only about half have handled refugee donations, has issued another notice strongly urging all industries to decide to handle refugee donations to benefit the disaster victims. The original letter is excerpted below: "Respected Sirs, The refugee problem in this city is becoming increasingly serious. It is everywhere, and all who have feelings cannot help but shed tears and give money. Although various trade associations and philanthropists have generously donated to allow refugees in the city to barely survive, it is now summer, and the heat is returning, and medicine is urgently needed to prevent unforeseen events. However, due to limited funds, there is no solution. Therefore, in addition to further fundraising, we also ask your trade association to handle business commissions starting today to support charitable efforts. We hope to receive a reply."

### Jewish Refugees Find New Land in Africa: Intention to Allocate Land in Abyssinia for German Jewish Refugees to Cultivate

The Continental Daily News reported that a letter from Vienna received here yesterday (26th) revealed that the Italian government has already allocated a large area of fertile land in Abyssinia for German Jewish refugees to cultivate and develop. The letter was sent by a Jewish relief organization in Vienna, whose organizers are the Dutch millionaire Kitmister and the Austrian Kofler, the owner of the largest brewery in Central Europe. The purpose of the organization is to help poor Jews leave Germany. Many Jewish refugees in Shanghai have received assistance with travel expenses from them. According to the letter, the Italian government has expressed its willingness to provide all possible cooperation to allow Jewish refugees to cultivate in Ethiopia. A large area of land has been allocated for the organization to distribute to Jewish refugees who are willing to colonize the Italian territory in Africa. Therefore, please report the names and other details of Jewish refugees in Shanghai who are willing to go to Ethiopia.

### Hongkou HSBC Bank Denies Selling Property: Would Consider Selling if Offered a Reasonable Price

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that the rumor that the Hongkou branch of HSBC Bank has been sold has been denied today (27th). However, Mr. Han Zhimeng, manager of the Shanghai branch of HSBC, told reporters this morning that if someone offers a reasonable price, he would be willing to sell the property. To date, HSBC Bank has only received proposals to lease the building. Although there have been mentions of purchasing the property, there have been no concrete proposals. Because the building is on the west end, he would be willing to consider a reasonable price. It is reported that the Hongkou branch of HSBC Bank is located at the corner of Broadway and Huade Road. Since the outbreak of the war, it has been operating at the office on the Bund. HSBC Bank has a large amount of property on Xiaoshadu Road and plans to open a branch there.

### Postal Remittance Bureau Resumes Telegraphic Transfers to Guangdong Province

In order to facilitate remittances to their hometowns for Guangdong natives traveling to Shanghai, the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, in addition to resuming money orders in February of this year, has now learned from a reporter from the New Voice News Agency that telegraphic transfers to the entire province of Guangdong have been resumed. The charging method is the same as for telegraphic transfers to other regions.

For telegrams exceeding 20 characters, an additional one jiao and two and a half fen will be charged. For each short comment attached by the remitter, the charge is two jiao and five fen per word. As for Beijing, Hankou, Xiamen, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Kaifeng, Jiangxi, and other places, the service has not yet been restored.

### Puppet Army of Xu Hongfa Forced to Leave Pudong: Under the Coercion of the Japanese Army, Part of the Force Has Set Out to the Front Lines

The "puppet army" of Xu Hongfa in the area of Shangchuan in Pudong has been continuously recruiting bandits and expanding its power, and the motley crowd now numbers more than 2,000. It is learned that the Japanese side, due to excessive casualties at the front, has ordered this "puppet army" to be transferred to replenish the battle. According to people from Chuansha, a batch of "puppet army" has been dispatched to other places under the suppression of the Japanese army. The "puppet army" originally had no combat power to speak of, and they are all timid and afraid of death. Therefore, before the departure, many deserted at the Chuansha railway station.

### Hankou's Past and Present Are Vastly Different: Foreigners Can Hardly Gain a Foothold, Foreigners Arriving in Shanghai Describe Their Suffering in Hankou: The Most Luxurious Hotel Has No One, Soviet Embassy Counselor Refuses to Meet Journalists

The Continental Daily News reported that the American warships Isabel and Wake brought 23 Americans, 11 Soviets, 4 Swedes, and 1 Norwegian from Hankou and arrived in Shanghai yesterday (26th) afternoon. Their general attitude is that Hankou is no longer a commercial center for foreigners and is the place they least want to reside. There are many reasons for this, mainly:

The following items: (1) Hankou has no water. Although the authorities claim that the water taps are open from 9 to 10 am and from 1 to 3 pm, there is no water when they are opened. It is not their fault. (2) Business between foreigners and Chinese is not thriving. (3) Japanese merchant ships continue to transport Japanese goods, but foreign goods are prohibited. (4) Puppet figures are likely to increase anti-foreign activities. (5) The Japanese army imposes restrictions, and foreigners cannot move freely. Most of the American expatriates arriving in Shanghai yesterday were church workers, and a few were businessmen, including Fitz Simon of Mobil Oil Company. It is heard that the kerosene business in Hankou is almost at a standstill. Currently, the Japanese warships are the biggest user of oil in the area, and most of the oil is transported by Japanese naval oil tankers. Coal is still difficult to obtain. It seems that there is plenty of food, but the use of electric lights is also restricted. Water is often insufficient. The Japanese army is trying to facilitate public convenience and restore normalcy, but it is not easy. The remarks made by Fan Liev, a reporter from TASS stationed in Hankou, who returned to Shanghai yesterday, can be seen as a glimpse of the lack of commerce in Hankou. Mr. Fan originally stayed at the Deming Hotel. When he left the hotel on the Wake and returned to Shanghai, the hotel

There was not a single guest in it, and the Swiss manager became a watchman. The Deming Hotel is the largest of its kind in Hankou. Before the fall of Hankou, the hotel was often full of customers, but now there are no travelers. Foreigners arriving in Shanghai also stated that the number of Japanese expatriates in Hankou has been increasing, and a thriving commercial district has been established, where transactions are conducted only in Japanese yen, and the customers are all Japanese. Chinese who are forced to return to Hankou have little surplus money to buy other things besides essential items such as food. As for the number of Japanese expatriates in Hankou, the figures vary. The lowest number is three thousand, and the highest is five thousand, but they all admit that it is continuing to increase. In the French Concession of Hankou,

Everywhere you can see Japanese people building houses. The French Concession authorities issue permits allowing them to enter. Japanese geisha houses have also begun to appear in the French Concession. There are about 300 foreigners still staying in Hankou. Due to restrictions, social life is not very active. Soviet Embassy Counselor Tayrabarin and his wife also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, but Mr. Tay refused to meet with journalists. It is said that he is quite exhausted, and if he decides to talk to journalists, it will be after he has rested.

### China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks Lay Out a Financial Network in the Interior: Carried Out in Four Phases, to Be Completed by the End of the Year: Efforts to Handle Discounting and Loans to Assist in Rural Construction

The Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, in addition to organizing joint offices and discounting committees to vigorously regulate national finances, have also been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to jointly carry out the layout of a financial network in the interior, closely coordinate, and step up work. The details are as follows:

Lay out a financial network: Recognizing the importance of finance in the rear, the China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks, through the decision of the Joint Office of the Four Banks, are setting up a financial network in the southwest and northwest provinces as a pioneer in economic development. Those currently being planned in Sichuan Province are Jin, Taihe, Nanbu, Mianyang, Guangyuan, Youyang, and Daxian. Other provinces such as Gui, Qian, Dian, Shanxi, Long, and Sui are also planning to establish branches successively in four phases, to be completed before the end of this year. After the completion of the financial network layout, the finance of the rear will be linked and connected, laying the foundation for future recovery. The prosperity of the interior depends on this.

Handling discounts and loans: The total amount of loans released by the Four Banks Discount Committee after the war has reached more than 20,000 yuan. The recent balance is still more than 70 million yuan. Local industries such as agricultural products, salt, hardware, electrical materials, and shipbuilding, as well as various manufacturers, all businesses directly or indirectly related to military affairs, can receive assistance from the four banks, thus making capital turnover flexible, increasing production, and doubling exports. Other work, such as lending money to store grain and maintain financial institutions, has also achieved remarkable results. The Discount Committee has become widespread in major cities across the country. The amount of discounts in Shanghai and Chongqing is more than 10 million yuan.

Revival and construction: Recently, the government has strongly advocated dispersing the urban population to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. The four banks have taken the initiative to allocate funds to build houses in nearby villages. They have now sent personnel to inspect suitable locations and are rushing to design them in order to complete them as soon as possible for the evacuation of citizens. The estimated cost is 10 million yuan. At the same time, in view of the fact that cities such as Zhushi have been severely bombed, resulting in the destruction of most of the prosperous areas, the Guizhou Provincial Government is actively planning for revival and has requested loans from the four banks to build city housing. The four banks have agreed to provide loans to assist in the revival.

### May 1st: German National Day

According to the French Shanghai Daily News on the 27th, it is heard that May 1st is German National Day. At that time, the German Consul General will hold a tea party at the Garden Club at No. 454 Haig Road to entertain foreign guests.

### Interview with a Celebrity: Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Spirit of Serving the Community: His Life Was Devoted to Loyalty, Faithfulness, Diligence, and Thrift: Decades of Struggle Have Convinced Both Chinese and Foreigners: Old News and New Transcriptions Are All Anecdotes of Shanghai

The Chinese Team of the Merchant Corps: Since the end of the case of the riot in the public hall, I have had two thoughts: (1) Chinese municipal power, (2) Chinese self-defense force. I am determined to achieve these two things. I first sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting that more Chinese be elected as directors of the Municipal Council to participate in municipal affairs. Later, the reply only allowed me to be one person. I thought that the proposal was too far from the goal and that it was necessary to demand it jointly. Therefore, I initiated the establishment of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and all leading merchants of various professions residing in the concessions joined the organization. Its authority was no less than that of a Chinese representative committee, and the future Chinese directors were planned to be produced from this. However, after prolonged disputes, it was a pity that there was no result. When the police went on strike, the International Merchant Corps came out to maintain order. Not only was there a lack of communication due to language barriers, which often caused disputes with passers-by and residents, but also the interests of the Chinese were often ignored, which further proved the importance of the Chinese self-defense force. The so-called self-defense force is the armed class of civilians. In the concessions, the International Merchant Corps is its self-defense force. However, Chinese merchants have no knowledge of martial arts, so it is necessary to train them first. Therefore, I initiated the establishment of the Chinese Merchant Gymnastics Association and invited leaders from various industries to join. The expenses were shared by each industry. A training ground was opened in Zhabei (the original site of the current Huaxingfang and Hua'anfang), and merchants who had studied at foreign schools and practiced military exercises were hired as instructors. After the advertisement was published in the newspaper, although many people signed up, they all hesitated when it came to wearing the yellow cloth exercise clothes and hats. Therefore, Mr. Hu Jimei, Mr. Yuan Hengzhi, and I took the lead in wearing these clothes and hats and walking in public to set an example. Everyone enthusiastically joined, and there were as many as four or five hundred people who participated in the exercises. After more than a year of practice, the level of progress improved day by day. It was then agreed with the Shanghai Municipal Council to add a Chinese team to the International Merchant Corps. The team commander was selected from the members of the Gymnastics Association to fill the position. I also issued a guarantee for each of them to ensure their behavior. I exhausted my heart and my words to achieve this result. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council still had two restrictions: (1) The captain of the Chinese team must be a British person, (2) Chinese team members must receive guns from the Shanghai Municipal Council when exercising, and they must be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Council after the exercise and not taken home. At that time, the merchants of the whole port and all the team members believed that the above two points were intentionally discriminatory by the Shanghai Municipal Council and expressed their dissatisfaction. I thought that this was a matter of qualifications and credit and that it could not be achieved by a momentary argument. It depended on human effort. Therefore, I encouraged everyone. Since then, the team members' service performance has been excellent, and their character and behavior have been noble. I believed that the time had come, and I began to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council to allow all Chinese team members to take their guns home. At this point, the treatment of the Chinese team of the International Merchant Corps was completely equal to that of the merchant corps of other countries, and the Chinese team's service spirit and self-love were praised by the people of the country. Therefore, merchant corps and defense corps were successively organized in Hunan, Zhabei, and various provinces and ports, and the revolutionary army even relied on the power of the Nanshi Merchant Corps to recover Shanghai. The fact that a group that served the community actually served the country was perhaps the result of the Chinese team of the International Merchant Corps.

Ningbo Commercial and Savings Bank and Ning Shao Company

It is observed that the commerce of all countries takes shipping and banking as the vanguard. I intend to imitate this and wait for an opportunity to act, and the pre-planned steps are to focus on the hometown first and then the country. At the end of the Guangxu Dynasty, there was only one Chinese bank, the China Merchants Bank, but the sovereignty was in the hands of foreigners, and loans were only convenient for officials and dignitaries. Therefore, I had the idea of establishing the Ningbo Commercial and Savings Bank and also handling savings, in order to facilitate and popularize it among the people. The name "Ningbo" was used to conform to the principle of focusing on the hometown first and then the country. Also, the water journey from Shanghai to Ningbo can be reached in one night, and the number of people traveling to and from Ningbo is particularly large. At the end of the Guangxu Dynasty, only the Beijing of Taikoo and the Jiangtian of China Merchants were operating on this route. The journey was indeed a case of demand exceeding supply, and the steerage fare was one yuan per person, which was more expensive than other routes. Therefore, a French person organized the establishment of the Oriental Company, which added large ships to operate, and Taikoo and China Merchants jointly reduced prices to compete with each other, and the steerage fare was reduced to five jiao. Later, after a year of stalemate, the three companies agreed to form an alliance and raised the fare to one yuan. I contacted the three companies separately, requesting that the steerage fare be limited to five jiao forever. Otherwise, the people of Ningbo would create their own company and operate their own ships. After repeated consultations, permission was never granted. Therefore, I invited fellow villagers to initiate the organization of the Ning Shao Company. However, at that time, some of the more advanced fellow villagers who traveled to Shanghai were unwilling to provide support due to other reasons. Fortunately, the people's intelligence gradually opened up, and the general ordinary industrial and commercial circles supported it quite a bit. Through hard work, the company was able to be established. The wharf is the only tool for the shipping business. At that time, the better sections of the Huangpu River were all occupied by foreigners. Therefore, the company first negotiated with the Japanese to lease the Toyo Company wharf east of the Waibaidu Bridge, but it was unsuccessful. Then, it negotiated with Sande Hall to lease the wharf south of the Waiyangjing Bridge opposite the French Consulate, but it was also unsuccessful. Later, it chose the Bund at the 16th Pier; however, the coastline south of the 16th Pier in Nanshi was all leased by the Dada Steamboat Company. The shareholders of the company were also related to the Oriental Company, so it was also unsuccessful. The company had no choice but to petition the Governor-General of Liangjiang in Nanjing and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in Beijing. With the help of Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong, it was able to lease the land and engage in the construction of warehouses. Therefore, it adopted the same steerage water and the same industry on the same route and jointly reduced prices, from insisting on a fare of one yuan to reducing it to two jiao, hoping to use capital strength to defeat Ning Shao. Fellow villagers worked together and organized a shipping maintenance association, raising cash. The association sold tickets to the outside world, setting the price at three jiao. The association recognized and subsidized the shortfall, amounting to more than 100,000 yuan. The unity of the Chinese nation gradually attracted the attention of foreigners. (3)

### Shifting of Financial Center Inward: Rapid Increase in Southwestern Banks; Various Banks Centralizing Strength to Merge Operations; Utilizing Floating Capital to Develop the Interior

Shanghai has always been the financial center of the nation. After the war, the center is shifting to the southwestern provinces, especially Chongqing and Kunming in Sichuan and Yunnan. The reserve funds of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank have long been moved to safe areas. The number of branches of the West China Bank and South China Bank has increased dramatically. Various banks are advocating for merging operations to concentrate their strength. Details are recorded below:

Wartime Distribution of Bank Branches: Banks are categorized by the geographic distribution of their head and branch offices. East China has 87 head offices and 573 branch offices; North China has 16 head offices and 347 branch offices; Central China has 11 head offices and 279 branch offices; West China has 17 head offices and 195 branch offices; South China has 12 head offices and 199 branch offices; Northeast China has 30 branch offices; Northwest China has 3 head offices and 26 branch offices; Overseas has 12 head offices and 42 branch offices. In total, there are 158 head offices and 1,691 branch offices, totaling 1,849 offices. Compared to before the war: (1) Head offices decreased by 3 in East China and 1 in West China; (2) Branch offices decreased by 12 in North China, increased by 1 in East China, increased by 12 in Central China, increased by 28 in West China, increased by 29 in South China, and increased by 6 overseas.

Sharp Increase in Branches of Chartered Provincial and Municipal Banks: Banks are classified as commercial savings banks, agricultural and industrial banks, and specialized banks. Commercial savings banks decreased by 3, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 1, and specialized banks decreased by 2. (Branch offices) Central and chartered banks increased by 23, provincial and municipal banks increased by 33, commercial savings banks increased by 7, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 1, and specialized and overseas Chinese banks each increased by 1. The following is a record of various banks in the past two years: (1) Central and Chartered (previous year) 4 head offices, 491 branch offices; (last year) 4 head offices, 514 branch offices; (2) Provincial and Municipal (previous year) 26 head offices, 464 branch offices; (last year) 26 head offices, 497 branch offices; (3) Commercial Savings (previous year) 73 head offices, 408 branch offices; (last year) 70 head offices, 415 branch offices; (4) Specialized Agricultural and Industrial Overseas Chinese (previous year) 61 head offices, 264 branch offices; (last year) 58 head offices, 265 branch offices.

Paid-Up Capital of 400 Million Yuan: Regarding the paid-up capital of banks, provincial and municipal banks increased by 3 million yuan, commercial savings banks increased by 1 million yuan, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 800,000 yuan, and specialized banks decreased by 1.4 million yuan. The following is a record of the paid-up capital in the past two years: (2) Central and Chartered (previous year) 167.5 million yuan; (last year) 167.5 million yuan; (3) Provincial and Municipal (previous year) 76.884 million yuan; (last year) 79.884 million yuan; (3) Commercial Savings (previous year) 83.248 million yuan; (last year) 84.248 million yuan; (4) Agricultural and Industrial (previous year) 29.486 million yuan; (last year) 28.686 million yuan; Specialized (previous year) 19.539 million yuan; (last year) 18.139 million yuan; (6) Overseas Chinese (previous year) 57.645 million yuan; (last year) 57.645 million yuan. The above units are in thousands of yuan. As of 1938, the total paid-up capital of various banks was 436.1 million yuan.

Concentrating Strength and Merging Operations: In the past, the problems with banking operations lay in mutual competition rather than cooperation. As a result, financial strength had several negative impacts on society and the economy. Before the implementation of the new currency system, there was competition in speculation on real estate, bid bonds, public debt, and foreign exchange. Only after the implementation of the new currency system did things gradually move towards legitimate avenues. To concentrate strength, the banking industry advocated for merging operations. In fact, the Jiang Zhe Bank merged with the Chung Hwa Bank, the Taiping Bank merged with the Kuo Hua Bank, and the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank jointly operated with the Jiangsu Bank. After the war, the Sichuan-Kangting Bank, Chongqing Civilian Bank, and Sichuan Commercial Bank merged to become the Sichuan-Kangting Civilian Bank. Guangdong Industrial and Sichuan Silk Industry merged with the Guangdong Provincial Bank.

Utilizing Floating Capital to Develop the Interior: After the war, all banks in Shanghai experienced a surplus of floating capital. Therefore, banks in Shanghai and other places appropriately reduced deposit interest rates to alleviate the burden. However, entrusted by depositors and for their own future, banks, after repeated and careful consideration of the use of funds, believed that utilizing floating capital to develop the interior was the most appropriate approach at present. At the same time, it could assist the government in completing the construction of the interior and developing the rich resources of the southwest. Simultaneously, the Guangdong Provincial Bank and the Fujian Provincial Bank, among others, established special agricultural departments one after another, using all their strength to develop agriculture in the interior, striving to increase agricultural products to facilitate the export of local goods. In addition, some banks, in response to complex social and economic structures, established trust departments to handle trust matters. As for the closure of banks after the war, in reality, there were only three, but Hengli has already announced its resumption of business.

### Japanese Troops in Jiangyin: Closing American Church Hospital; The Reason Given is Failure to Register with the Puppet "Ministry of Health"; The Church Has Reported to the Shanghai Consulate for Action

The Continental Daily reports that Japanese troops are continuing to infringe on the rights of foreigners in the occupied areas. At the end of last week, officers from the Japanese military's special affairs department closed the Jiangyin Hospital, run by the American Presbyterian Church. The reason given was that the American doctors at the hospital refused to register with the puppet "Reformed Government" Ministry of Health. According to church personnel, the matter has been reported in detail to the authorities at the American Consulate in Shanghai, who have agreed to take action on behalf of the church.

However, what official action will be taken has not been confirmed here as of last night. It is reported that the Jiangyin Presbyterian Church suffered only minor damage during the fighting in the area. However, after the city fell, a "suspicious" fire broke out in the church buildings. Although there were no fatalities, nineteen to twenty-two church buildings were indeed

burned to the ground. The destroyed buildings included a hospital and two schools. Only the former boys' dormitory, a nurse's residence, and the residence of a Chinese doctor remained. The two schools have now withdrawn from Jiangyin and relocated to the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. The undamaged Jiangyin school buildings are now being used as a sanatorium, managed by the elderly Dr. Moffett, who has lived in Jiangyin for over thirty years and has done much to help with relief efforts during and after the war.

...Love grows in the spring, do not waste the good times...

This is a pressing issue for married couples or unmarried lovers. In this happy spring season, some couples indeed have deep affection like the sea, and their joy surpasses flying. They give birth to clever children, organize happy families, and live harmoniously, with endless happiness! However, there are also many couples who, even in this bright moon and clear wind of the spring evening, enact tragedies of sleeping in the same bed but having different dreams, or even quarreling and losing harmony! Spring should be the season for love to grow, but now love is shaking or being destroyed in the spring. Why is this?

Our research on the foundation of love cannot do without these three major elements: environment, mood, and innate instincts. If couples feel that they are always stuck at home, lacking interest, then take advantage of this bright and sunny season to go to the garden or the countryside for a small stroll, or take a short trip. Once you gaze upon thousands of miles beyond, seeing pairs of butterflies flying, pairs of fish swimming, and myriad colors decorating the embroidered spring scenery, at this time and in this scene, both your minds and eyes are pleased, and their love will surely increase a hundredfold. This is an example of how the environment increases love. In addition, if a man gets good news outside, or does something satisfactory, or gets an unexpected amount of money, at this time, because of his happy mood, the love between him and his wife will surely increase a hundredfold. Therefore, love is closely related to the environment and mood, and smart couples will surely be able to make good use of it.

However, although love has a great relationship with the environment and mood, the main foundation is innate instincts. A smart and strong husband will surely be able to use the environment, create an environment, to cultivate the mood and please the mood. So this is not a problem. If a man has committed masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been promiscuous and indulgent, or has been injured by worry and labor, resulting in seminal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, and infertility after long marriage, then even in this good time and beautiful scenery, when the mood is happy, love will surely vanish in an instant. However, his wife, unable to get comfort and feeling that her years are wasted, can she not be sad and angry? Family tragedies mostly arise from this. The only way to remedy this is to take the "Reproductive Element," a strong animal gonad preparation, which is the most effective treatment. Because this agent can produce sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, invigorate blood circulation, and nourish nerves after taking it, continuing to take it will surely cure all of the above symptoms completely in a short period of time, and can also achieve the effect of prolonging life. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hemitot's Sperm Consolidation Pills" to consolidate the sperm gate and stop the leakage, then both the root and the symptoms will be treated, and the effect will be even faster. If patients can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by expert doctors and then receive various scientific treatments such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

Beauty

### New Methods for Breast Development

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Beautiful breasts can indeed increase a woman's beauty. The so-called curves are undoubtedly completely controlled by the breasts. If there are no high breasts, is it possible for the curves to be rich and exposed? I think it is naturally impossible. Therefore, breast development has almost become a required course for modern women. In view of the inability to reach the standard of development, they do not hesitate to use various methods to pass off fish eyes for pearls. However, when the curtain of the spring boudoir comedy opens, this trick is still exposed, and men see it as worthless, or even give cold words and sarcasm, making her ashamed to have no place to go!

But why do women have this defect? According to the results of research by famous Chinese and Western gynecologists and myself, it is considered to be entirely due to various reasons such as malnutrition, masturbation, leukorrhea, major illness, perennial malarial fever, irregular menstruation, and failure to recuperate after childbirth, which leads to impaired ovarian function and affects metabolism. Therefore, the breasts become loose and withered, even flat like a man's, the hips are thin, the muscles are withered, and what makes them feel hateful is that even at the age of youth, their foreheads are already covered with wrinkles. With such an ugly woman, if she wants to win the love arena or win the husband's heart, is it still possible? The only way to remedy this is to take the ovarian preparation female "Reproductive Element," which is the most effective treatment. This agent was invented by the German medical saint Dr. Steinach after more than thirty years of arduous experiments, and has been proven by many famous European and American doctors to have peaceful medicinal properties and great efficacy. Regardless of various women's hidden diseases, they can be completely cured in a short period of time. If continued, not only can it turn withered breasts into high breasts, but it can also eliminate uterine diseases, promote pregnancy function, beautify the face and blacken the hair, and prolong youth.

### The Tragedy Encountered by Young People with Nocturnal Emission

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

The sexual distress of young people is indeed present. However, you should have rich reason to guide you onto the bright road, why be driven by the temporary impulse of passion and fall into the abyss. We also know that the sexual desire during the period of spring passion is strong. However, you must not commit masturbation because of sexual distress. You should know that after one masturbation, there is a tendency to commit it a second time, and it is easy to develop into a bad habit. Once the bad habit is deep, nocturnal emission is almost inevitable.

Semen in the body functions to promote developmental function, invigorate metabolism, and nourish nerves in all parts of the body. If nocturnal emission is treated early, the damage to the body is less and it is easier to cure. If you delay and muddle through, it will inevitably lead to exhaustion of essence and depletion of blood, then developmental function will be blocked, leading to incomplete development, and some parts will be as short as a finger. The metabolic function will decline, and the brain, spinal cord, and sex, the three major nerves, will be destroyed. All kinds of symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, insomnia and dreaminess, back pain, premature ejaculation and impotence, thin semen and infertility will follow. This kind of youth is sick and in pain, not only will they fail in academics and career and be abandoned by society, but also because of their sallow and thin appearance, they will not be liked by women and will fall into the pain of unrequited love. In short, what he encounters is nothing but tragedy!

At this time, the most reliable effective treatment for nocturnal emission is to take "Hemitot's Sperm Consolidation Pills." Because this agent can consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves after taking it, nocturnal emission can be cured naturally.

### Why Does Gonorrhea Recur?

Experienced clinicians must strive to completely cure gonorrhea for the sake of the patient. They will never give up their sacred responsibility halfway and use brutal drugs, clumsy surgery, or perform improper treatments, causing the condition to be forcibly suppressed, leading to future troubles.

For example, in the acute stage of gonorrhea, doctors use strong washing methods or brutal drugs in order to gain the patient's trust. As a result, the discharge of pus temporarily stops, the urine becomes clear, or only two or three strands of gonorrhea are seen during urination. At this time, doctors often tell patients that your illness is completely cured and does not need to be treated anymore. However, many patients often relapse after a few days at home. You should know that the pathogens of gonorrhea not only breed on the entire surface of the mucosa, but also often penetrate deep into the mucosa or spread to the adjacent accessory organs, where they re-form lesions. Therefore, even if strong washing drugs are used, even if the symptoms on the surface of the mucosa are fortunately cured, the adjacent accessory organs will relapse. You should know that the presence of gonorrhea strands in the urine is of course not a complete cure, and even if the urine looks clear to the naked eye, it cannot be determined that it has been cured.

To avoid the above drawbacks, only the use of German Leuren-Pingliu electrotherapy and ultra-special chemotherapy can quickly eliminate gonorrhea. Because Leuren-Pingliu electrotherapy has a wide and deep powerful bactericidal power and can clarify its toxins, and it is even more complete with ultra-special therapy and agile and painless surgery. Then, because the bactericidal power is very thorough and the toxins are clarified, once cured, there will be no recurrence.

### Renfeng Factory Workers Accuse Factory Owners of Embezzlement; Alleging Factory Owners Embezzled Over 40,000 in Dividends; Defendants Deny This and Await Sentencing

Xu Tingkeng (38 years old, from Nantong, residing at 152 Difeng Road), the current factory owner of Shanghai Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Xie Keming, the former factory director from Ningbo (46 years old, residing at 160 Edward Road), previously filed a private prosecution in the criminal court of the Special District Court against Zhu Gengtao (52 years old, from Jiading, residing at 94 Masnan Road), the general manager of the factory, for breach of trust and embezzlement. The first instance has just been judged. Now, Cao Xingbin, Wei Tingzhu, Jiang Lianqing, Xi Yufa, Chen Minkui, Yao Linsheng, Zhang Fuguan, and other 77 employees of the Renfeng Factory

jointly hired Wu Chuliang and Xie Ju, two lawyers, to file a private prosecution in the criminal court of the Special District Court against Xu Tingyu, Xie Keming, Zhu Gengtao, and others, the factory directors and manager of the Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, for jointly embezzling bonuses, requesting a legal investigation and ordering the funds to be handed over for distribution. According to the complaint, the plaintiffs are employees of the Renfeng Factory with very low monthly salaries, ranging from two to ten yuan, and rely on year-end bonuses to maintain the lives of their families. The Renfeng Factory’s annual

surplus, after deducting public accumulation, is distributed according to fifteen shares. Shareholders receive ten shares each, while employees and managers each receive two and a half shares. The surplus for 1936 reached 650,000, but the defendants only claimed a surplus of 170,000 and distributed 25,000 yuan, concealing more than 41,000 yuan. Now, during the case of Xu and Xie suing Zhu Gengtao, Zhu confessed that the surplus for 1936 was 650,000, meaning the defendants embezzled the bonuses. It is requested that a legal investigation be conducted. The court, according to the complaint, held a hearing with Judge Zhu Chuzhe.

Because the defendants did not arrive, the order was changed to a different time. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, another court hearing was held. The plaintiffs, Cao Xingbin, Chen Minkui, and Yao Linsheng, accompanied by their lawyers, attended the court and stated the circumstances of the embezzlement by the defendants. The defendants, Xu, Xie, and Zhu, accompanied by their defense lawyer, Chen Wencan, attended the court. According to Xu Tingyu, there was no embezzlement of bonuses. There are no fixed rules for annual bonus distribution. In addition to the employee bonuses, there is also a public fund distributed every three months, generally

at a rate of six or seven yuan per yuan of salary. The other two defendants, Xie and Zhu, were questioned. Xie Keming stated that the Renfeng Factory was originally founded by me, and I sold it to Xu Tingyu in 1935. Zhu Gengtao stated that there was no embezzlement. The plaintiffs also stated that Xie and Xu are related by marriage. Because of the Jinde Bank incident, Xie superficially sold the factory to Xu, but in reality, he is still the boss. The court verified the statements and, considering that the case was simple and clear, ordered that the debate be opened and then announced its conclusion, with sentencing scheduled for May 1.

### Shui Mingda: Abandoning His Victim After Seduction; Seduced a Young Girl and Abandoned Her; Court Orders Out-of-Court Settlement

Fan Liu, a woman from Jiangyin residing at 8 Dongshengli, Dongxinqiao, in the British Concession, acting as the legal representative, accompanied by her daughter Fan Yueying, 19 years old, hired lawyer Liu Liang to file a private prosecution in the criminal court of the Special District Court, stating that Yueying was seduced by Shui Mingda, the son of Shui Fuxiang, a compradore for the Haifu Shipping Company residing at 63 Mercer Road, to a hotel in September of the lunar calendar last year, and after they had relations, a marriage agreement was made, setting a date for the wedding. However, after reaching his goal, Shui Mingda

abandoned her and ignored her. The girl is now six months pregnant. When approached, Shui avoided meeting. It is requested that a trial be conducted for the crime of disrupting family relations, and a supplementary civil suit is filed, seeking compensation of 2,000 yuan and lifelong alimony of 4,000 yuan. The court, according to the complaint, ordered the court director, Liao, to hold a hearing.

Because the defendant did not appear, the hearing was postponed. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, another

court hearing was held. The defendant, Shui Mingda, accompanied by his defense lawyer, attended the court. His parents and third older sister were also present in court to listen. The plaintiff, mother and daughter, also attended the court with their lawyer. According to Fan Liu, her daughter was seduced, and I went back to my hometown, so I didn't know. When I came to Shanghai and saw that my daughter was pregnant, I asked and found out. Now, if the defendant marries my daughter, then I have no objection. Otherwise, I request that he be prosecuted. Fan Yueying stated that the defendant's third sister opened

a room in the Dafang Hotel, with the window facing my sister's residence. I was seen by the defendant at my sister's place. On September 15, he waited for me outside the alley and took me to a hotel room. After I became pregnant, he abandoned me and ignored me. I looked for him but couldn't meet him, so I came to sue him. The marriage agreement was written by the defendant himself. Shui Mingda admitted to having a relationship with the girl and making a marriage agreement, setting the wedding for October of this year. They first met at the Great World, and his parents agreed to the engagement. The court verified the statements and ordered both parties to reach an out-of-court settlement. The hearing was rescheduled for May 11. The defendant was released on bail by his defense lawyer.

### Bandit Gang Plots Robbery of Pig Brokerage, Encounter Mishap on Arrival, Rob Officer of Handgun and Flee, Culprits Subsequently Arrested and More Accomplices Captured

Yesterday afternoon at 1:15 PM, four bandits suddenly appeared at the accounting room of the Longtai Pig Brokerage, located at numbers 4 and 5 of the Xuehua Fang on Xuehuali Road in the French Concession. Two of the bandits were armed with handguns. The bandits initially entered through number 4, intending to proceed to the accounting room at number 5. However, upon reaching the reception hall of number 4, they encountered a young woman sitting there, holding a baby in her arms. Upon seeing the intruders wielding handguns, the woman recognized them as troublemakers. She threw the baby to the ground and ran into number 5, shouting for help to catch the thieves. Realizing their plan had gone awry, the bandits abandoned the robbery and fled through the doorway. At that moment, Yuan Hefu, the security guard of the lane, arrived upon hearing the alarm and was about to draw his handgun. Unexpectedly, one of the bandits spotted him first and pointed his gun at Yuan, restraining him and seizing Yuan's handgun. They then fled north along Xuehuali Road, through Pingyuan Fang, across Jiaeryi Ai Road, and towards Dapu Bridge. Upon reaching Xujiahui Road, they turned around and saw Yuan Hefu, the security guard whose gun they had stolen, still pursuing them relentlessly. The bandits then fired two shots in the air as a warning. However, by this time, only two bandits remained, as the other two had already escaped midway. The two bandits then hailed two rickshaws on Xujiahui Road, intending to escape by taking the opportunity, but Yuan continued to pursue them closely, shouting as he chased. Coincidentally, a Chinese constable, badge number 56 from the French Concession police, was returning home on a bicycle. Hearing the alarm, he joined the pursuit, passing through Tailasituo Road, Fulili Road, and arriving at Beidang Road. The number 56 Chinese constable ran to the Beidang Road police station to report the incident. A large number of detectives were immediately dispatched to surround and capture the bandits. As a result, two bandits were intercepted by a detective on the spot, and two handguns were found on them, one of which was the one stolen from Yuan. They were immediately taken into custody. After a strict interrogation by the police chief, they identified themselves as Li Rusheng and Qiu Yishou, both from Zhenru. One of the bandits had a gunshot wound on his arm, which he claimed was accidentally inflicted by his companion when firing a warning shot midway. At the same time, the two bandits also revealed the addresses of their accomplices. Two people were apprehended in room 340 of the Dongya Hotel in the Public Concession, and seven people were apprehended near a certain location near Dongxin Bridge. The case is currently under further investigation.

### Hongkou Car Crash, Mrs. Li Li and Western Police Chief Both Lose Memory, Remain in Comatose State

The Shanghai Times reports that in a car crash on Broadway on Sunday evening, Western Police Chief Wimsett was injured and suffered a concussion. He has lost all memory of the events leading up to the accident. As a result, personnel from the Public Concession Police Department have been unable to further investigate the circumstances that led to the tragic accident. Doctors caring for Mr. Wimsett have attempted to question the injured Western police chief, but it is said that the injured party immediately forgot everything after the accident. It is unheard of. It is reported that Mr. Wimsett not only does not remember any of the details of the collision, but also cannot even remember getting into the car of Mr. and Mrs. Li Li. Doctors hope that Mr. Wimsett will soon recover from this condition and be able to speak. Mrs. Li Li was still unable to speak to police yesterday. It has now been confirmed that Mr. Wimsett was originally stationed at the Waibaidu Bridge when he was summoned by a foreign couple, apparently Mr. and Mrs. Li Li. According to witnesses, Mr. Wimsett was standing near the sentry box of the British West Fortress Highland Regiment when he was summoned to assist Mr. and Mrs. Li Li in resolving a traffic dispute. A Japanese navy spokesman denied on Tuesday that the Li Li's car had reached the Waibaidu Bridge after being held up by wire mesh obstacles on Broadway Bridge.

### Claims to be Artificial Silk Salesman, Scams Silk Firm Out of Payment, Continuously Frauds to Cover Up, Case Exposed, Arrested and Awaiting Sentencing

Li Genfu, a local resident who used to be an artificial silk salesman and lives at number 86 Fujian Road, recently claimed to be a salesman at the Japanese-owned Kawabe Ichiyo Foreign Firm at number 223 Sichuan Road. He solicited goods from various silk firms. Li contacted Mr. Chen, the manager of Hengfengtai Silk Firm at number 284 Guangdong Road, by phone, offering to sell ten boxes of artificial silk, stating that the price was 335 yuan per box, with payment upon delivery.

Upon receiving the funds, Mr. Chen sent his younger brother, Chen Genquan, to Kawabe Ichiyo Foreign Firm to meet with Li Genfu. After handing over the payment of 3,350 yuan, five boxes were immediately delivered, with the remaining five boxes to be delivered one hour later. However, after waiting for a long time, Chen did not see the goods arrive, so he inquired about Li, who kept dodging, claiming that the goods had already been sent out. Chen Genquan then requested to go with Li to find them, but to no avail. Knowing that he had been deceived, he handed Li over to the Old Gate Police Station, which transferred him to the General Patrol Police Station. Detective Zhu Wanjun questioned Li, who admitted to the fraud. He claimed that of the funds he received, 1,675 yuan for the five boxes had already been paid, 1,000 yuan for the remaining five boxes had been returned to Liu Ganyuan, 600 yuan had been deposited with the old treasurer Xu Acai, and 75 yuan had been used as Xu Acai's transportation fee. It turned out that Li had used the same trick on the 20th of this month to swindle 1,226 yuan from Liu Ziyuan, a silk merchant at number 19, Taian Lane, Tiantong Road. Because Liu was pressing for repayment and he could not make up for it, he used the method of "cutting flesh to mend sores" and defrauded Chen Longquan out of funds to return to Liu. After the detective verified the confession, he went to Liu Ziyuan and Xu Acai at number 36 Shenchang Lane, Haining Road, and recovered 1,600 yuan of the stolen money. Li was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the Criminal Court No. 4 of the First Special District Court, who prosecuted him for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code and stated the above situation. According to the reports submitted by Liu Ziyuan and Chen Genquan, the representative of Hengfengtai Silk Firm, who clarified the details of the deception, Li Genfu's confession was evasive. Judge Dai Rongduo verified the confession and ordered Li to be detained to await sentencing on May 4th. The recovered stolen money of 1,600 yuan should be returned to Chen Longquan for collection. The organization has always been fully committed to animal protection work, such as investigation and publicity, and has achieved remarkable results, which has greatly benefited society and people's hearts, not only reducing unnecessary suffering for livestock.

### Letters

To the Editor, I read in your newspaper's local news column on April 26th that your lawyer represented Mrs. Wei in a case against Locke Qiu for damages, requesting mediation from the Second Special District Court, saying that Kaituo Wei is the alias of Gan Weilu. This is not in accordance with the facts, because the client entrusted to our lawyer is a female transliteration Kai Wanwei, which is very different from your newspaper's description of Gan Weilu's alias Kaituo Wei, etc. I am afraid that the inaccurate words will be passed on and become untrue, which will affect the fairness and integrity of our lawyer's handling of cases, so I hereby send a letter to clarify and ask for correction, and I am very grateful for it. Sincerely, Lawyer Tang Huaiqun, April 27th.

Dear Editor, I have just read the news in the local news column of your newspaper on the 23rd of this month, "Drug Agency Cracked in Xujiahui," and the main culprit is at large. I was very surprised when I read it. It concerns my reputation and is of great concern to the police, so I have to state the details and ask for correction, which I will be very grateful for. I have been a doctor for more than ten years, and the profession has been passed down through generations. I hold a doctor's license from the Municipal Sanitation Bureau and have always used medicine for a living. Moreover, I am a member of the intellectual class in the medical field, and I would never dare to engage in illegal business. In March of this year, I rented out my spare room to a Mr. Chen. Only after Mr. Chen moved in did I know that he had an opium addiction. Knowing this, I was afraid of violating the ban and hindering my responsibility as a second landlord, so I repeatedly warned him to terminate the lease, but Mr. Chen refused on the grounds that it was difficult to find a rental. As a result, it has been delayed until now. Unexpectedly, after 12:00 midnight on the 21st of this month, after I had already fallen asleep, Chinese and Western detectives suddenly came to my place to search, saying that someone had reported that I was selling opium and drugs. After a thorough search, only a set of smoking paraphernalia and a small amount of opium were found in Mr. Chen's room, with no morphine or other drugs. Therefore, Mr. Chen's family of three and the smoking paraphernalia were taken to the police station for questioning. Because of my relationship as the second landlord, I ordered my wife to go to the police station with me to be questioned. However, the police station only imposed a fine for the matter of opium smoking. Unexpectedly, I now see a newspaper report that is very inconsistent with the facts, making irresponsible remarks and spreading rumors. It can be seen that someone must be against me, deliberately slandering me and destroying my reputation. I cannot cover up the truth from the public, and the police station has a record to prove it, so I specially send a letter to request correction to set things right. This is my sincere prayer. To the Editor of the News Department of the Shenbao, Wang Huikang respectfully, residing at 55 Zhenbei Street, Xujiahui.

The meteorological forecast from Xujiahui Observatory at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong is sunny, very warm, with fog, and strong northwesterly to southwesterly winds. Here there will be westerly to northerly winds. The East China Sea is sunny to cloudy, with strong northerly to northeasterly winds. The highest temperature in Shanghai in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was 75.7, and the lowest was 45.5. On the same day last year, the highest was 74.8 and the lowest was 45.0.

### Facts That Are Enough to Excite

— Mao Lie

The gloom of the past few days has been swept away by news, no, facts, that are enough to excite. This is the recapture of Nanchang, this is the British conscription.

Originally, the gain or loss of a place is insignificant in our overall war of resistance plan, so major cities can sometimes be abandoned, but Nanchang is very important; according to reports, it has been recaptured, and Kaifeng has been attacked and defended multiple times. Therefore, now, our army's attack on Nanchang is not only saying that it is gratifying that our army has recovered Nanchang, but also that it is gratifying that our army has the strength to attack Nanchang. If Nanchang can be attacked, what place cannot be attacked! The strength of our army can be seen at a glance, who is not excited by it!

Speaking of the United Kingdom, since Chamberlain decided to curb the ambitions of the aggressors, he has been preparing for war in many ways and through many procedures, but until recently, it seems that there has been no substantial achievement, which is inevitably disappointing. Now, the government he leads has resolutely and decisively implemented the conscription system. The achievement of this move, I think, is no less than the effective implementation of the anti-aggression organization. Because: first, from now on, the United Kingdom will be prepared, and will not be afraid of the event, blindly accommodating the aggressor; second, France, the Soviet Union, and other democracies will be more at ease with the United Kingdom, knowing that she will not use other countries as cat's paws to take chestnuts from the fire for her. The determination of the United Kingdom, for the first time, is actually seen in action, who is not excited by it!

Of course, we cannot be satisfied with excitement. Because excitement is mostly temporary and lacks permanent value. Therefore, in addition to this decisive excitement, we must still calm down and promote these exciting facts so that they finally become a satisfying victory.

I hope that under this excitement, our compatriots across the country, whether in the front or the rear, can strengthen our strength so that our final victory can be realized as soon as possible. After attacking Kaifeng and then attacking Nanchang, we have indeed embarked on the road to victory.

I hope that under this excitement, the United Kingdom will no longer waver and will indeed be able to do it effectively so that the aggressor has no means to use his tricks. In fact, Huntington's recent return to office, Hitler did not see him, the foreign minister did not see him, only the director saw him, which can also be said to be a great humiliation. Under this stimulus, at least he should wake up!

I believe that spirit surpasses everything, as long as everyone is determined, a satisfying victory will surely be realized soon, and it will be more than just exciting facts!

### Drizzle

— Jiaqi

Outside the window, a misty drizzle began again, so fine it resembled the tip of an autumn hair, flying onto the glass, blurring the window.

The drizzle flew to the earth, tiny droplets merging together, and the earth became wet.

The drizzle flew onto people's faces, like steel needles, piercing their skin with pain.

The drizzle flew onto people's bodies, seeping into the gaps of their clothes, so wet they could be wrung out.

This drizzle, falling time and again, continuous and incessant. What is it for, after all?

The earth is covered with dust, filth, baseness, and shamelessness. It suffocates people's breathing, obscures their vision, taints the innocent with dirt, and oppresses the noble into the lowly. Demons seize the opportunity to run rampant, and the world seems to be going mad.

People, in this situation, have completely lost their reason, as if under an incurable spell, unable to distinguish anything, without the slightest resistance, prostrating themselves under the demons' feet, allowing themselves to be played with and humiliated.

The endeavors that people undertake, having lost their masters, all come to a halt. What can be destroyed is destroyed, what can be sullied is sullied, unable to release any more radiant light to assist humanity. The entire society immediately regresses, never to move forward again.

Darkness swallows the whole world.

The drizzle, unable to tolerate this state of affairs, unwilling to endure it any longer, wants to wash and cleanse the world, drive away the demons, so that dust, filth, baseness, and shamelessness will never grow again. It gathers its courage, though its power is so small, yet it unyieldingly, once, twice, thrice, flies on, flies on, flies on.

The glass window is blurred, urging people to wipe it clean, banish the darkness, and see the light again.

The earth is wet, urging people to wash away the dust and filth and attain clarity.

The pain on people's faces is urging them to wake up, to stop dreaming, and quickly extinguish the external attacks.

Seeping into the gaps in the clothes, it is urging people to have the courage and perseverance to stop the demons' erosion and to strive to resist!

Falling time and again, it trains people to have the enduring spirit to fight and not to stop halfway!

Oh, the continuous drizzle, how great it is!

We uphold the spirit of struggle, we receive the drizzle's hint, we purify our society, extending it to the entire earth, the light is ahead!

The misty drizzle flying outside the window is a bright lamp dispelling darkness!

### Among the Reeds

— Sifang

!! One Night at Zhao's Ferry

Zhao's Ferry is a desolate little crossing on the Huangpu River. Hidden in the reeds, few boats anchor here, making the silence all day long terrifying. The wind blows through the reeds, rustling eerily.

Now it is evening. The evening tide of the Huangpu River beats against the beach, its roar like a mournful cry. The reed beds are buried in the thick of the night, bowing their heads as the night wind whistles mournfully past, causing those heads to sway left and right.

In the dark sky hangs a pale moon, like the face of a corpse, scattering its faint light, making everything seem even more sorrowful and mournful.

Suddenly, a rustling sound comes from the reeds. There are also the sounds of footsteps moving in the shallow water, and faint whispers, mixed with the weeping of the wind, rising and falling, making it difficult to hear clearly.

Half an hour later, there is no sound, only the river shouting in a heavy voice, great clumps of foam swirling and rushing to the beach, rolling into the reeds.

The moon is covered by a cloud, with no trace of light, and everything is as black as ink.

From the reeds, a very faint, but rapid breathing sound is revealed. Amid the shouting evening tide of the Huangpu River, the sound of wooden oars splashing through the water rings out.

A small boat is rowing swiftly over from the opposite bank.

From the inky blackness of the night, it can be vaguely seen that five or six people in yellow clothes are sitting in the boat, all with guns on their backs, their eyes wide open like those of eagles, greedily watching the dark night sky. Some are whistling happily, sometimes uttering loud laughter.

—Row faster!

A shout, like a sudden thunderclap, bursts out in the silent night, and the sound of the oars splashing through the water becomes more urgent, and the boat moves faster.

In the reeds, there is a slight stir, and footsteps move in the water.

—Quick! Get ready! Old Chi's boat is getting close.

There is a low command, followed by a low murmur between each other, and then everything is quiet again, with only the wailing of the night wind, the lapping of the tide, and the sound of wooden oars striking the water in the middle of the river, like a somber symphony being played together.

The small boat gradually rows closer to the shore, and the people on the boat laugh happily.

—Bang!

The first gunshot rings out from the reeds, followed by a rapid burst of gunfire. The bullets shoot towards the small boat, like hard hailstones mixed in a violent rainstorm, and a puff of thick smoke pours out of the reeds, with flames flashing in the dark night sky.

By the time the men in yellow jump up in surprise and raise their guns to aim, two have already fallen on the bow of the boat, fresh red blood flowing from the bow into the river.

Endless bullets shoot out of the reeds, and the bullets from the boat shoot aimlessly into the reeds.

The quiet Zhao's Ferry is now lively, with bullets whistling through the air like madmen. The shouts from the reeds are like angry roars coming from thousands of throats, and the flames turn half the sky red.

An hour later, the burst of gunfire has passed, and the flames have been extinguished, leaving the stench of gunpowder and blood mixed and floating in the quiet air.

On the Huangpu River, a small boat has capsized, and several corpses are rolling with the waves, the turbid water mixed with fresh red blood.

Fresh red blood also flows into the river from the reeds, and some people are groaning in agony, but their cries are drowned out by the heroic shouts and songs of joy.

By this time, dawn has broken, and the morning light shines into the dense reeds.

### Axis Blocked

— Lihua

### Kong Yunting and Rousseau

— Qiongfu

— A Record of Beneficial Reading

Kong Yunting, in the preface to his "The Peach Blossom Fan," narrates the story of the play's circulation, with these two points:

"After 'The Peach Blossom Fan' was completed, princes, dukes, officials, and gentry all borrowed copies, creating a paper shortage. On the evening of Yimao, a eunuch urgently sought 'The Peach Blossom Fan.' I gave him a carefully transcribed copy, forgetting where the original manuscript was. Then, I found a copy at the home of Zhang Pingzhou, the grand censor, and presented it to the imperial residence at midnight, thus entering the imperial palace."

"In the fourth month of Gengchen, after I had resigned from my post, Master Mu'an invited me to see 'The Peach Blossom Fan.' At that time, officials from the Hanlin Academy and the provincial governments all gathered, letting me sit alone in the seat of honor, ordering the actors to toast me in turn, inviting me to critique the play.

The guests whispered and pointed, with a quite proud air."

One can see at a glance that the author takes pride in this. But this cannot bear close scrutiny. "The Peach Blossom Fan" "mainly expresses the pain of the fall of the Ming Dynasty," but the author is pleased to receive the Qing Dynasty emperor's attention and the Qing Dynasty princes and officials' support, which is truly incomprehensible. Is this really proof of what some of our "scholars" claim, that the work and the author's personality are completely unrelated?

But let it be, let those "scholars" be happy. However, this makes me think of an ancient Frenchman who was once denounced by our "scholars."

Rousseau, in the eighth volume of his "Confessions," narrates the scene when his opera "Le Devin du Village" was performed, which is somewhat similar to Kong Yunting's proud scene. He says that he, as the author, was also sitting in a box, and opposite him were the emperor, the queen, and all the figures in the court. He, with his beard unshaven and his clothes unchanged, sat there high, listening to the praises and comments of the aristocratic ladies around him. He also narrates the scene after the performance, which is more enviable than what Kong Yunting took pride in. He says that the next day, the emperor was going to summon him and personally give him an annuity.

Everyone knows that Rousseau was a mortal enemy of the emperor and the aristocracy. Even the successful play at that time, although it is now generally recognized as a mediocre work, still expressed the emotions of the common people and promoted his ideas. But he described the emperor and the aristocracy being so kind to him in such a way that it seemed he himself was taking pride in it. This is clearly like Kong Yunting, slapping himself in the face.

From this point of view, our "scholars" should not have denounced Rousseau. Didn't Rousseau also help prove the opinions of the scholars?

But don't rush to conclusions. Although Rousseau narrated that he sat with the emperor and the aristocracy, he was proud of being unadorned, sitting with the emperor and the aristocracy in the clothes of a commoner. Then he greatly elaborated on the reason why he didn't shave his beard or change his clothes, meaning: I'm watching my play, to hell with it. Although he also narrated that the emperor wanted to see him, he immediately said that he didn't want to see the emperor, and even used sarcastic language to say some reasons why he didn't want to see the emperor. Rousseau was, after all, a bit of a "killjoy," and in the end, he gained nothing to be proud of like our Kong Yunting.

In the end, China has something that foreign countries may not have. Rousseau is not a pleasant person, and I now understand why our "scholars" want to denounce him.

But don't rush to conclusions. If you have read the great work of one of our "scholars" introducing "Confessions," when you read the above two paragraphs, you will be surprised. Rousseau sitting with the emperor and the aristocracy was introduced; but Rousseau's elaboration that he looked down on the clothes of the upper class was completely banished from "civilization" and was not seen at all. The emperor wanting to see Rousseau was also introduced; but Rousseau's sarcastic words about not wanting to see the emperor were translated into two sentences with a changed face. It turned out that our "scholar" insisted on making Rousseau exactly the same as the literary writers in our history. This work was considered a success. It's just that those "scholars" who denounced Rousseau didn't seem to have seen this great work, which is a pity, a pity.

Spring and Autumn

### A New Chinese Opera is in the Making

— Xialuo

The Ouya Theater Company Renames Itself the International Theater Company. The International Grand Theater is Scheduled to be Completed Before the End of This Year

Some call Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera "Chinese opera." Can Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera be considered "Chinese opera"? Let's not talk about it for now, but it is a fact that a new Chinese opera has not yet been established.

Indeed, we have also seen "Storm on the Yangtze River" (unfortunately, the playwright and star of the play, Mr. Nie Er, has passed away), and more recently, we have seen "The Poppy Flower," written by Wu Xiaobang, with music composed by Chen Gexin, and performed by students of the Sino-French Theater School. These are all samples of new Chinese opera, but in terms of quality and quantity, we are still not satisfied. Especially, without a permanent organization to do the pioneering work, it is very difficult to establish a new opera that can survive on its own.

What should be the content and form of the new opera? This awaits discussion by experts and is not allowed by this short space. However, it can be generally imagined. On the one hand, it should absorb and melt the strengths of European and American operas. On the other hand, it will also have China's own inherent components. The two will merge, and the new Chinese opera will be established.

What I want to report to you here is the news that a new Chinese opera will be born under a plan.

We probably won't forget that not long ago, the Lyceum Theater performed the opera "Carmen." The Ouya Theater Company performed this play. Although "Carmen" was a French opera in that performance, the Ouya Theater Company, which performed the play, was quite ambitious to establish a new Chinese opera. After the performance of "Carmen," they were even more enthusiastic about this point. Now the plan has been decided, and with the increase and expansion of the organization, the name has also been decided to be changed to the "International Theater Company."

The International Theater Company's plan is roughly divided into four departments: (1) The original French opera troupe will soon travel to Saigon, Hanoi, Java, and Singapore to perform. During this travel performance, they plan to invite several opera talents from France again, and then establish a performance network in Saigon, Hanoi, and Shanghai, so that they can perform in rotation in the future. There is no problem with theaters in Saigon and Hanoi, because the French government is quite supportive of the arts, and the French authorities there will definitely give them a good theater. As for Shanghai, they plan to build a theater themselves. (2) This theater, in addition to performing foreign operas, also plans to perform Chinese operas and dramas, and even improve Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera, so that it is the most complete and suitable theater for performing dramas and operas in terms of equipment, and the programs staged are also a full warehouse of spiritual food. The name of the theater is the International Grand Theater, located in the central area of the French Concession, quiet in the midst of the hustle and bustle, and the transportation is very convenient. The design of the theater is being drafted, and the shares have been almost raised. For the remaining balance, it is planned to be publicly raised soon. (3) As for the group that performs new Chinese operas, it has recently been organized, and the script is being written. What can be reported to readers is that they have held several script discussion meetings. Starting next week, they will also begin rehearsals. The name of the company is the International Opera Company. The relationship between the International Opera Company and the International Art Theater Company is equivalent to the drama organization of the Sino-French Friendship Association and the Shanghai Theater Company. The names and addresses of the participants, etc., must be kept secret for the time being. This is to apologize to the readers; what can be "revealed" is that they have decided to use new people as much as possible for the members (especially the actors), so as not to cause conflicts with the drama aspect, so as to avoid dispersing manpower. Fortunately, since the new opera is a new pioneering work, it makes more sense to let new people pioneer. (4) At the same time, in order to cultivate new opera cadres and talents, they also plan to set up an opera training class. This batch of new blood can not only improve the level of future performances, but also, in terms of quantity, when the opera movement develops in the future, they will indeed need them to enrich and lead it, just like the drama now, which needs new blood to supplement and enrich it. Although the establishment of the opera training class will be after the work of the opera company has taken steps, they have also begun to look for a house, because the work of the opera company is believed to be able to get on the right track soon.

Although most of these plans are still on paper at present, they have already begun to be implemented, so they will soon be concrete and will be able to see some results. For example, the International Grand Theater is scheduled to be completed before the end of this year, and by that time, the opera of the International Theater Company should have been premiered long ago.

### Thoughts on "Spring Grievances in the Western Palace"

— Ruhua

“Girl School”

Produced by Columbia Pictures, Shown at the Grand Shanghai Theater

"Spring Grievances in the Western Palace" tells us about the situation of a girls' school in the United States (in fact, it can also be said to be a general one). This situation also falls into the almost "foreign countries have it, we also have it" situation. For example, this journal once published an "Unofficial History of the Drama Circle," in which Miss Wang Ping was expelled by the school authorities for acting, which was considered to be "defaming the school's reputation." And the "storms" caused by "love" in general are also very many. The dormitory headmistress checks the students' letters, and the girls' dormitory is like a forbidden palace, but is such careful prevention actually perfect? I don't need to answer this. The occurrence of "storms" is the most accurate answer. Naturally, young girls should be cautious about their "lifelong events," but going too far can also be counterproductive and more harmful!

In "Spring Grievances in the Western Palace," Lin Lian was expelled by the school authorities for not returning one night. The reason for the expulsion was "defaming the school's reputation." However, when Lin Lian's father, Xin Puson, was willing to "invest in the construction of a library and donate it to the school," the principal also "stopped the matter." In this way, people can't help but think that the term "school" as a "learning shop" is not an excessive satire. Moreover, "Spring Grievances in the Western Palace" has even greater satire, that is, the last female teacher, who is over the age of flowers, is the first to elope with her lover. This may be "acting," but people are always people, after all, and it is a fact. Is it the best "management" method to lock those young female students in the "palace" like prisoners?

We do not oppose the strict prevention of the school authorities, nor do we oppose expulsion for "violating school rules," but when using the beautiful term "defaming the school's reputation," we should think about whether this "management" method is reasonable and whether there is any "inadequacy." Because after an "accident" has occurred, the school authorities should at least bear some responsibility!

It cannot be denied that "Spring Grievances in the Western Palace" is a relatively meaningful script in exposing the "hypocrisy" of some schools. However, because the director's skills are weak, it just tells us such a "story" in a straightforward manner, and the power of satire cannot be seen at all. At the same time, such as the atmosphere of the girls' school, and the initial discord between Lin Lian and Laiteli, and then becoming friends, its process is also insufficient. That is, the most lively scene in this film—the party, is also not outstanding.

The few actors are also mediocre.

Mr. Zhang Lanting:

Thank you very much for your comments on the illustrations of "Heroic Little Warriors." At the same time, we will encourage ourselves and will never fail the readers' enthusiasm for loving this publication, but the last point, the facts are the most powerful proof, and you can ask the master to release your worries. And I hope that other readers can give us comments at any time, and I am very lucky.

### Overseas Chinese in Early California

— Boming

Recently discovered records in California, USA, have led to new discoveries regarding the extent to which Chinese participated in gold mining and railroad construction in California. It is well known that Chinese laborers built the western end of the transcontinental railroads in the United States and Canada, but few people know about the participation of Chinese in early gold mining in California. The attached drawing shows Chinese engaged in gold panning and railroad construction, which was originally published in an old newspaper and is now reprinted from the "Sino-American Chronicle," the organ of the Sino-American School in the San Francisco area, which provides education for Chinese orphans.

According to an article in the newspaper: The first Chinese to emigrate to California landed in San Francisco on the American sailing ship [missing ship name], in February 1848, with two men and one woman. The woman worked as a domestic servant in the Gillespie family, and the two men went to work in the newly discovered gold mines. Other news also said that Chen Ming (transliteration), who sold tea, fans, shawls, and other Oriental goods, arrived in California in 1847. Then, Chen Ming arrived earlier than the three. Chen also joined the gold rush and earned a lot of gold. He immediately wrote to his friend Cai Yun (transliteration) in Guangzhou. Soon Cai Yun and his wife also went to California to seek gold.

The news of the discovery of gold in California caused almost as much of a sensation in Guangzhou as it did on the East Coast of the United States. The Chinese called it Gold Mountain, and still use this name to refer to California. At the end of 1848, there were only seven Chinese registered in California, but by January 1850, there were already 800 people: by the end of that year, there were 4,000 people; and by the end of 1851, the number had increased to 12,000; according to a census in 1860, there were almost 30,000 people; in 1870, there were more than 60,000 people; and in 1880, the Chinese population reached an unprecedented height, with more than 100,000 people.

Due to the special social situation caused by the discovery of gold, the Chinese in San Francisco engaged in the laundry business. Later, this activity spread throughout the United States. The symbol of "gentlemen" and those who became rich by panning for gold in California in the early days was a starched white shirt, but it became a real luxury because everyone was engaged in gold panning and there were few women, so washing white shirts became a serious problem, and laundry fees became excessively expensive. Many people sent their shirts to Honolulu by ship for washing, which was indeed more economical. At that time, the diligent Chinese felt that this was an excellent opportunity, so they engaged in washing and starching white shirts. As a result, Chinese laundries sprung up everywhere and were very popular, and were called "mutual benefit associations."

However, many Chinese went into the mountains to pan for gold, and many also discovered large amounts of precious metals. Chinese people poured into the mines, and the wages they earned were lower than those earned by Irish immigrants, which led to prejudice and hatred, and eventually to riots and anti-Chinese movements. The same was true on the railroads. Irish immigrant laborers and native-born politicians, most of whom were Irish, had serious disputes because of the Chinese. Later, gold mining became increasingly difficult, and it was necessary to purchase machinery at great expense, so the Chinese turned to running stores, cultivating gardens, and other businesses. (Translated from Miller's Review of the Far East)

### CHINSE　IN　CALIFORNIF-EARLY　DAYS

### Rain After the Storm

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Nine:  Sorrowful Mushrooms Bitterly Sprinkle Tears on All Sides, Frugality Cultivated Through Diligence Creates Ten Mu of Land

Let's talk about Mrs. Su Liya and Jin Danyu discussing the establishment of a family-style new car company. Jin Danyu said that for the sake of a trial run, the assumed capital would be three million yuan. Mrs. Su Liya calculated and said, "That kind of car costs an average of 30,000 yuan to manufacture per vehicle. Let's calculate with fifty cars, which would cost 1.5 million yuan. The remaining 1.5 million yuan will be used for various equipment. The head office will of course be located in Shanghai. We will first start a trial run on the highways of Jiangnan, setting up branches in Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. Fortunately, building houses doesn't cost too much, as long as they can accommodate the vehicles. Among these fifty cars, thirty will be prepared for family use, ten for engineers, and ten for scholars to use for exploration. Although this is a hypothetical, it has some meaning. The most common use is for family travel, preferably one husband and one wife, with at most one child. It is suitable for honeymoon travel for newlyweds. During this honeymoon, they can choose the most beautiful scenic spots, drive the car there, and stay there. Isn't that the most free? In Europe and America, we highly respect the honeymoon. I remember more than ten years ago, the large airplanes flying from America to China, like the Clippers, each had a room prepared for newlyweds to live together, for their honeymoon travel. Even today, these large airplanes have rooms for couples. Now that this type of car is popular, the honeymoon travel business alone will be quite substantial. Therefore, I plan to allocate five-thirds of the cars for family travel. It doesn't matter if there are fewer for engineers. In the future, if there are large industrial organizations, engineers will need to use such cars. They may want to create their own designs and ask car manufacturers to produce them. Whether for surveying or supervising construction, a large industrial organization should equip itself with those cars and not necessarily rent them from others. As for the cars used by scholars for research and exploration, we should certainly prepare them; however, most scholars' research is mostly done indoors, with fewer in cars. Moreover, many require different equipment, so we can only prepare fewer of them." Jin Danyu thought Mrs. Su Liya's plan was very good. However, when Mrs. Su Liya invested in establishing an enterprise in China, she was unwilling to operate it solely. She insisted on cooperating with Chinese friends. She could bear half of the capital, and the profits would be divided equally. (97)

Entertainment World

### From Liu Baoquan to the Cultivation of Performers

— Hai Ce

Famous actors and actresses enjoy fame for only a short time,

Luck and connections have little to do with it;

It's all about indulging in smoking, wealth, alcohol, and lust!

Liu Baoquan, the King of Drum Song, is truly like Tan Xinpei in Peking Opera and Yu Hongyuan in Han Opera in the world of drum song. He is not only unprecedented, but simply unparalleled. I heard his performances when he first came to Shanghai, more than twenty years ago. The location seemed to be in the New World Variety Show. The plays I heard included "Intercepting the River and Fighting," "Battle of Changsha," "Wulongyuan," and "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats." Now it's his third time in Shanghai—the second time was three years ago, I didn't hear it. I went because of his fame back then, and because I am from the South, I couldn't fully understand his lyrics, but I felt that the beauty of his rhythm was indeed different from Bai Yunpeng. Now I can revisit the old tunes, and perhaps it's the last time. (Liu is already seventy-one years old. After returning north this time, who knows when he will come again?)

I saw Liu Baoquan's demeanor the other day. His face is rectangular, much thinner than in the late Qing Dynasty. His head is already bald and shiny, with only a tuft of graying hair at the back. Although he is over seventy years old, his spirit is still vigorous. Having been famous for decades, his art has not declined to this day, and his voice is still clear and bright. It is said that there is a major reason for this: he has absolutely no hobbies in his life. He dislikes smoking, alcohol, lust, and other passive pastimes. This shows that "cultivation" is of great importance to performers. Many famous actors and actresses are like昙花一现 (ephemeral), enjoying fame for only a short time before disappearing into obscurity. They attribute this to "luck" or "connections," but in reality, "cultivation" is the main reason and accounts for the largest component!

### Liu Baoquan's Strict Self-Discipline

— Xu Muyun

Liu Baoquan, the King of Drum Song, performed at the Da Zhonghua Bookstore in this city a few years ago. The results were very good. Even though the seat price was as high as one yuan, it was still packed every day. This proves the Shanghai people's warm welcome to his art. Liu was originally from the Pear Garden and studied Sheng roles. He was skilled in both civil and military roles. Later, seeing that there were many talented Sheng actors at the time, it would not be easy to stand out. Therefore, he abandoned acting and specialized in drum song. He had a natural voice, high-pitched, clear, and mellow, and no one could surpass him at the time. In addition, he had learned martial arts in his youth, so when he performed "Battle of Changsha," Guan Yu and Huang Zhong fighting with swords, his posture was like that of the famous Tan actors on stage. Moreover, his singing was vivid and colorful, able to move the audience and attract their spirit. When he was angry, the audience was also angry. When they heard his sorrow, the audience was also sad. His performance of "Ningwuguan" could inspire people and encourage the cowardly. His singing of "The Great West Chamber" was graceful and charming, vividly portraying the voices and postures of a talented scholar and a beautiful lady. He was truly able to imitate anyone he played. He could understand the personality and gender of the characters in the book in detail. The difficulty of drum song lies in one person simultaneously imitating the different voices, laughter, appearances, languages, and actions of men, women, old, young, civil, military, noble, and humble people. When Baoquan sang, he was not only able to imitate them vividly, but his tone and voice were also excellent, enough to overwhelm his peers. The honorable title of "King of Drum Song" was almost unanimously agreed upon by everyone. Alas, Liu can truly be called a genius in the art world.

Liu is now seventy-one years old and has one son and one daughter. His daughter is married to a Mr. Li from Xuzhou. His son, Shaoqing, is a graduate of Huiwen College in Peiping. He has a good foundation in Chinese and English. He usually wears a suit and leather shoes and does not resemble an artist's son at all. Baoquan has been in the singing world for decades and has accumulated a lot of savings. He does not want his son to follow in his footsteps, so he independently founded the Liu Private Primary School in the old capital. Shaoqing served as the principal and achieved remarkable results. In recent years, Shaoqing, seeing that his father was getting older and often went to other cities to perform, had to give up his school affairs to accompany his elderly parent and handle all internal and external affairs. I have been friends with Shaoqing for ten years. According to what he told me, his father is usually very strict with himself. He has certain rules for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Here is a brief description of his general situation.

Liu's Clothing: He is very fond of simplicity. Most of the clothes he wears were made ten or twenty years ago. Although the styles are old, they are exceptionally clean. Before going on stage, he is polite and courteous. After bowing to the audience, he must first explain in detail the plot of the book he will sing that day, and then slowly take off his mandarin jacket. Then, holding the clapper, he begins to perform his excellent songs.

Liu's Food: He usually eats vegetarian food. He avoids sour, spicy, and stimulating foods. He rarely eats meat. He often declines invitations from friends to banquets. When he cannot avoid it, he asks Shaoqing to attend in his place. Over the decades, he has been able to maintain his excellent voice without any damage, which is due to his moderation in diet and avoiding unnecessary social engagements.

Liu's Residence: He has a house he bought himself outside Qianmen in Peiping. The courtyard is clean, and the interior is elegantly furnished. The doors and windows are opened and closed at fixed times. Liu has maintained a consistent lifestyle for decades, paying attention to air circulation and regular living. It is simple and unadorned, and does not emphasize appearance. From this, we can see a glimpse of his personality.

Liu's Transportation: When Liu is at home, he often exercises outdoors after meals. He walks slowly instead of riding in a car. He often goes to open areas and walks around for half an hour to aid digestion. He generally does not use a car unless absolutely necessary. His frugal style can also be taken as a model.

The reason why Liu can enjoy longevity and his voice becomes better with age is that there are main reasons for this: (1) He usually does not engage in promiscuity. He often sits quietly with his legs crossed, or reads scriptures and books to pass the time. (2) Every time he finishes a song and enters the backstage, he must quickly fold a hot towel and cover his head, and also cover his forehead. He lies on a sofa and reclines for about a quarter of an hour. Only after the sweat from his whole body and face has completely dried can he wash his face and change clothes and leave the backstage. When he is resting with his eyes closed, no one is allowed to talk to him or open or close the windows to avoid cold air entering. The habit of drum song is to start slow and then speed up, singing faster and faster. Even young people who sing this must be exhausted and hoarse. However, Baoquan is like a long river, flowing thousands of miles. Every word can hit the audience's eardrums. Because of this, his whole body is wet as soon as a song ends. If he does not get enough rest and let the sweat dry completely, then if the wind enters his pores, he will definitely suffer from colds and coughs, which will affect the roundness of his voice. Although this is a small matter, Liu can persevere in it and has never changed for decades, so his reputation can last forever.

### Liu Baoquan's Expressions When Singing

### Impressions of the Palace Museum Photography Exhibition

— Shou Juan

The scenery of the old capital has been in my heart for almost twenty years. I have suffered from being tied down by affairs and have not been able to see it all at once, and I can only lament my failure. A month before the July 7th Incident at the Lugou Bridge, my old friend Li Zixin had a trip to the old capital and strongly urged me to go with him. I was hindered by my duties and could not go, so I politely declined. When Li returned, the war broke out, and the old capital soon fell. I was even more distressed. My friend Dr. Ding Hong also went to visit before the war and took hundreds of photos and returned, as if taking a posthumous photo before his death. Alas, how sad! The other day, collectors in Shanghai held an exhibition of calligraphy and paintings from past dynasties to raise funds for medical expenses, and the results were remarkable. Dr. Ding, suffering from illness, also followed up with a photography exhibition of the Palace Museum, selecting more than 100 of the most exquisite works, enlarging them one by one, and displaying them in the exhibition hall. I went to visit yesterday and felt that his photographic art had reached perfection, and while allowing people to linger in the scenery, a thought of restoring our homeland arose spontaneously, so its significance is also very profound. (Attached are more than 60 portraits and foreign landscapes, which are also worth viewing.) Among them, such as the Temple of Heaven, the twelve-layer jade railing, the painted beams and carved ridges, the Nine Dragon Wall, the Imperial Vault of Heaven, and the corridor, all show the architectural beauty of our country's predecessors, while the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, the Falun Hall, the Yonghe Temple, the sunset over the Forbidden City, and the place where Emperor Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty died for his country, evoke feelings of nostalgia for the past and sadness for the present, leaving people lingering with endless thoughts. For those like me who have not had the opportunity to visit the old capital, being among them is like personally visiting with wax clogs, which is really a good source of information for lying-in travel. After watching and returning, my feelings are endless, so I composed two quatrains to show to Dr. Ding:

Ten thousand brave soldiers vanished in a night, the blood on Lugou Bridge was crimson,
The rivers and mountains are beautiful but not our land, tears flowed as I mourned the Palace Museum.

Looking north at Yanyun, the sky is dim and green, a catastrophe fills the sky and a flock of wailing geese cry,
Remembering the dreams of the past, the Palace Museum with the energy and intestines shaken.

### Qian Qian Studio Drama Talk (Part 2)

— Zhang Xiao Chan

Talking about the Skills of the Qionglin Banquet

Yu Shuyan's singing of the Qionglin Banquet is one of his masterpieces in his life. Whenever he went to various places to perform, he would always show this play to the audience. He also had two characteristics: one was the scene of asking the woodcutter. After asking and knowing the whereabouts of the woodcutter's wife and children, he immediately entered the stage. When the woodcutter called him back, Shuyan's demeanor of coming out of the stage door, looking like a madman but unwilling to come back, was very similar to Lao Tan, very, very good. There is another characteristic that I want to explain now. Lao Tan's exit from the box was casual, but Xiao Yu's was different. He was in the box with his head and neck resting on one end of the box opening, and his feet resting on the other end of the box opening. He used the strength of his whole body to stretch his body straight, and then rolled onto the stage from the box opening. This point is very different from Lao Tan. This kind of skill, if you ask Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, or Yang Baosen to do it now, I'm afraid they can't handle it. In terms of skills, it must be said that Xiao Yu's skill is good, but in terms of the rationality of the situation at that time, after Fan Zhongyu was injured and fainted, he would definitely not have the strength to perform like Xiao Yu, right? Therefore, I praise Xiao Yu's skills, but I do not approve of his plot. However, I must say that Lao Tan's throwing shoes and dropping them on his head in the Nao Fu scene is not necessarily something that the plot requires. It is the same as Xiao Yu's exit from the box. You can only talk about skills and not talk about rationality.

Lao Tan's throwing shoes and dropping them on his head is now considered to be Lao Tan's unparalleled skill of hitting the target every time. In fact, it is not so. In the three times I saw it, one time was when Lao Tan saw that the shoes were thrown with great certainty, and he listened to the shoes falling on his head without changing his expression. One time, it was thrown improperly, so he used his hand to catch it on top of his head. One time, he was afraid that the shoes would fall to the ground, so he stretched his hand over his head, and when the shoes were close to the top of his head, he retracted his hand and listened to the shoes falling on the top of his head. It can be seen that Lao Tan himself was not very sure, and he also knew that he had practiced this skill very well.

Old Newspaper New Excerpt (13)

### The County Magistrate Flings His Sleeves and Leaves in the Zhang Fuquan Case Hearing

(See this newspaper from April of the eleventh year of the reign of Tongzhi of the abdicated Qing Dynasty)

Zhang Fuquan was sued by Sun Azhu in a case involving twisting the county. Because Zhang was employed by a foreigner, he was supposed to be jointly interrogated in court. Therefore, Dao Xian ordered the Chief Adjutant Chen to join County Magistrate Ye, the consul, and the translator for a joint trial. First, three people, including Li Longgui, who had helped with the twisting that day, were brought forward. County Magistrate Ye was about to interrogate them, but the Western official forbade him from speaking. County Magistrate Ye said, "If you don't want me to say a word to interrogate, why do you call it a joint trial, and why bother with a joint trial at all?" He flung his sleeves and left. Those waiting for the trial below the steps saw the county magistrate entering the inner chambers and all wanted to disperse in a commotion. The foreign patrol captain quickly ordered the doors to be closed. Chief Adjutant Chen comforted the Western official and persuaded the county magistrate, so he returned to the court. After questioning, it was clear that Zhang Fuquan should not have mistakenly believed the women working at the brothel to act aggressively and violently, privately trapping Sun Azhu. This was a serious violation of the regulations. Sun Azhu and Zhang Fuquan had a minor feud, and he gathered people in the concession to pull and drag him forcefully, which was also inappropriate. Therefore, the verdict was set, with each of the original defendants sentenced to six months of imprisonment to warn the wicked. Li Longgui and others who helped with the dragging were punished lightly, each wearing a wooden collar for five days to show a light punishment. During the interrogation, a man with short hair and a long gown, calling himself a small person, went straight to the court and stood upright without kneeling, saying that he was a witness for Zhang Fuquan. Chief Adjutant Chen beckoned him closer and asked him what was the matter. The man wanted to say something, but Sun Azhu scolded him below, "This is a turtle (cuckold), how dare he stand next to the case?" Those watching the trial couldn't help but laugh. (Note: Zhang Fuquan was originally a rogue who committed many evils. After being employed by a Westerner, he became even more unscrupulous. When he broke the law, he thought that the Westerner was enough to protect him, but he didn't know that there was public opinion on right and wrong, and the Westerner would definitely not be able to protect him.)

### Finance:  Expecting Hitler's Speech to be Mild, Cash Prices Continue to Prosper, Ultimately Foreign Banks Continuously Supply, Stop Rising Slightly Under the Buying Power of Hong Kong Gang

Yesterday's black market situation for cash 烚赤 (smelting red silver) continued to prosper, inheriting the afterglow of the previous day, and the public gradually believed that Hitler's speech today would have no impact on the axis of the European situation. Therefore, the rich and wealthy people's intention to collect and store recovered, and they competed to absorb funds through money changers. Therefore, in the morning, it soared to a high peak of 2,080 yuan. Afterwards, although money changers continued to absorb purchases, and a certain silver shop (on behalf of the Hong Kong gang) also followed suit, but the silver shop gang and gold shops took advantage of the high prices to sell off, and a certain silver shop continued to supply on behalf of foreign banks, so the rising trend weakened and gradually presented a fluctuating situation. As a result, it continued to rise by 5.5 yuan, but the range of ups and downs in the middle was still mediocre. The people's hearts were stable, and the transaction was slightly busy, about 710 taels. Silver shop jewelry was up by one yuan, customs gold was still flat, and Sino-British pure gold and other items rose again.

烚赤 Rose Again by Five and a Half Yuan

Since the morning, the initial buying intention of money changers for each bar (ten taels) has been very strong, and the Hong Kong gang also wanted to absorb purchases. Therefore, sellers temporarily waited and watched, and the buying price was shouted up from 1,073.4 yuan to 80 yuan before a deal was seen. First, a certain money changer (on behalf of speculators in this city) entered the gold shop for 50 taels, with 2,080 yuan as the opening price, which was 8.5 yuan higher than the previous close. After the opening, a certain money changer also entered the gold shop for 50 taels, with the same price as the morning opening. Then, another money changer also entered the gold shop for 50 taels, with a price of 79 yuan. Later, the money changers did 50 taels with the same price. After that, although a certain silver shop absorbed purchases on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, it was not affected because the silver shop gang had a good intention to supply. A certain silver shop entered the trade for 100 taels and the gold shop for 50 taels, both at 78 yuan. Later, the silver shop gang sold 50 taels back to the money changers, also at 78 yuan. At that time, a certain silver shop suddenly sold on behalf of the receiving bank, so the potential was slightly weak. A certain silver shop sold 50 taels each to a certain silver shop and a certain money changer, both at 77 yuan. After that, it extended to noon and no business was seen, so the noon closing price was still 77 yuan. In the afternoon, because a certain money changer continued to absorb purchases, the initial opening was raised by 2.5 yuan. Then, a certain money changer entered the silver shop gang for 50 taels, with a price of 79.5 yuan. After that, the gold shop took advantage of the high price to sell again, and it immediately fell back. The gold shop sold 50 taels to a certain money changer, with a price of 77 yuan. Later, at 4:10, a certain money changer entered the trade for 50 taels, also at 77 yuan. However, a certain money changer still wanted to absorb purchases, and once shouted 77.5 yuan to buy, but it was still difficult to find an opponent, so no business was done. Therefore, the evening closing price was still 2,077 yuan. As a result, it rose by 5.5 yuan compared to the previous close (only 3 yuan difference throughout the day). The selling price of cash shop's own brand gold was 2,082 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,072 yuan. The spot gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and no business was done.

Jewelry Gold Rose by One Yuan

Silver shop jewelry, the exchange price per tael, was not changed at first. When it came to about 10 o'clock, because 烚赤 opened at 2,080 yuan in the morning, it was raised by one yuan. There were no changes after that. Datonghang changed to 211 yuan, Xintonghang was 209 yuan, and the purchase price was 203 yuan.

British Gold Suddenly Rose by Half a Penny

London, 26th: British pure gold suddenly rose by half a penny per ounce, rising to 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pennies. As a result, the central bank's Chinese cash purchase price also rose to 1,212.3 yuan. The listed customs gold was still flat, calculated at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 4 jiao, calculated at 1,207.6 yuan.

### Japanese Merchants and Foreign Firms Vigorously Settle Foreign Exchange: Forward Rates Slightly Tight, Spot Rates Flat

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, major foreign firms and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (acting on behalf of Japanese banking circles) aggressively bought and sold. Asiatic Petroleum and Texaco also followed suit, settling for June and July deliveries of British and American currency. However, foreign banks such as British and American ones showed slightly less interest in providing forward contracts, while remaining willing to supply spot currency. As a result, the forward market showed a slight softening. The swap between spot rates and May rates could have been eliminated, but now the British pound needs to soften by 0.015625, and the U.S. dollar tighten by 0.03125. However, the spot market was stable due to the support of foreign banks and the selling by Bombay money houses, resulting in little change. The final result was flat, with brisk trading. As for the Hong Kong dollar, foreign firms showed strong buying interest, so the transactions between yarn brokers and foreign firms were not affected, and the final result was also neutral.

In the early morning, London telegraphic transfers, both near and far, remained flat. The New York silver price remained unchanged. The London spot gold price rebounded by half a penny. In foreign exchange, the pound was flat against the dollar, Shanghai currency, and the French franc. The dollar was down by 0.0125 against the pound, flat against Shanghai currency, and down by 0.0625 against the French franc. The central bank's posted exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling rates of 8 pence and 25/100 for the pound and 16.0625 yuan for the dollar, both flat compared to the previous close. After the opening, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (acting on behalf of Japanese banking circles) and major foreign firms continued to buy and sell actively. However, as British and American banks continued to show strong willingness to supply currency, there was no impact. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (acting on behalf of Japanese banking circles) and foreign firms settled spot pound rates at 8 pence and 25/100 with HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, and also settled spot dollar rates at 16.0625 yuan with Banque Belge pour l'Etranger. HSBC's posted rates remained unchanged, and the announced silver equalization tax also remained unchanged, still at a slight 5.25%. Later, Asiatic Petroleum felt a sense of security and aggressively absorbed forward British and American currency, but foreign banks showed less interest in providing forward contracts, leading to a slight softening of the market. Asiatic Petroleum settled forward pound rates for June and July at 8 pence and 21875/100000 with HSBC. Subsequently, Texaco also purchased forward dollar rates for June and July at 15.9375 yuan with an unspecified bank. Nearing noon, trading became quieter, with a slight amount of Hong Kong dollar trading. Foreign banks, including Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, sold spot Hong Kong dollars to foreign firms and yarn brokers at 55.875 and 55.75 yuan, a fairly stable situation. By the afternoon close, banks' spot selling rates for both British and American currency were the same as the morning opening, with the Hong Kong dollar at 55.75 yuan.

In the afternoon, foreign firms and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank continued to buy and sell, but in small amounts, leading to a quieter market. First, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (acting on behalf of Japanese banking circles) settled spot pound rates at 8 pence and 25/100 with the Bombay money house. Subsequently, foreign firms purchased spot dollar rates at 16.0625 yuan from an unspecified American bank. Afterward, foreign firms absorbed spot Hong Kong dollars from foreign banks at 55.75 yuan, resulting in no change in the process. By the late close, banks' spot selling rates were 8 pence and 25/100 for the pound, 16.0625 yuan for the dollar, and 55.75 yuan for the Hong Kong dollar. As a result, the British, American, and Hong Kong currencies were all neutral compared to the previous afternoon close.

### Japanese Yen Plummets

Yesterday, spot gold in London rose by half a penny, and the pound-dollar exchange rate fell by 0.0125. In the local market, foreign firms were actively settling accounts for British and American currencies, and banks were supplying them smoothly. Market prices remained stable as before. Banks were actively absorbing Hong Kong dollars, but the supply was not strong, so market prices were slightly tight. The black market opened with money changers buying and selling in sudden spurts. The supply from gold shops and customers was relatively scarce, and market prices were firm. Later, bulls took profits at high prices, and the upward trend slowed slightly. In the afternoon, money changers' absorption revived, and customer supply was also strong, showing a revolving pattern. The final result was a significant increase. There was strong demand for foreign British and American gold pounds, because forward exchange rates were soft, and the black market rose sharply. The price of British gold pounds was firm and slightly higher. Demand for British and American gold notes was very strong, and banks were absorbing large quantities. Trading among peers was very frequent, and market prices rose slightly. There was a slight supply of Hong Kong, Singapore, and rupee notes, but demand was very scarce, and prices fell slightly. Japanese gold notes were in abundant circulation, and very few Chinese people collected them. Even Japanese people entering and leaving the country were subject to restrictions. Moreover, military needs were enormous, and over-issuance was getting worse. Demand was scarce, supply was high, and the market was weak. The value was approximately one yuan. Trading at the guild was very active. Qintai sold 50 pounds of British gold notes to Dingyuan, Hengmao sold 1,000 yuan of American gold notes to Xiangkang, Xiangkang sold 10 pounds of British gold notes to Hongchang, Qintai sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Hongchang, Zhenxing sold 20 pounds of British gold notes to Hongchang, and also sold 200 yuan of American gold notes to Tongfeng, and also sold 200 yuan of American gold notes to Xiangkang. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold pounds up 10 cents, British gold notes up 1 cent, American gold notes up 2 li, Hong Kong notes down half a cent, Singapore notes down 1 cent, rupee notes down half a cent, and other currencies unchanged.

### Counterfeit Currency Reaches Its End: A New Low Price Seen Yesterday, Worth Only 76 Cents

In North China, since the puppet "Provisional Government" stipulated that the use of legal tender be prohibited from March 11, forced its exchange, and imposed severe penalties, the people, due to the "counterfeit currency" having no reserves, are facing it becoming worthless paper. Although under the power and violence, they still collect legal tender.

In recent days, the Chinese army has not only won victories in the Jiangxi and Guangdong wars, but also achieved successive victories in Jin and Yu. The hope of winning the war of resistance is growing stronger. The people of North China are even more afraid of using counterfeit currency and do not want to accept it. As a result, the exchange rate of legal tender has become increasingly firm. Yesterday (27th), Tianjin reported that the black market rate of the counterfeit "Federal Reserve Certificate" opened in the morning, continuing to be cheaper by five yuan compared to the morning opening on the 26th. 100 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 130.05 yuan of "Federal Reserve Certificates," meaning that one yuan of "Federal Reserve Certificate" was worth only 76 cents and 6283524/10000000 legal tender. It can be seen that the people of North China believe in legal tender and their enthusiasm for supporting the National Government. The policy of the Japanese puppets to destroy legal tender has already been declared a failure.

### Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops by 1.5 Yuan

Hong Kong Exchange Market Stabilized

(Tianjin) 27th Dispatch: Compared to the previous day, the exchange rate was longer by 0.125 for British currency and longer by 0.25 for American currency. The Shanghai currency exchange rate dropped by 1.5 yuan. The opening price this morning is listed below:

British Currency 8 pence 3125/10000

American Currency 16.25 Yuan

Shanghai Currency 99 Yuan

(The Shanghai currency is the amount receivable in Tianjin for 100 yuan of Shanghai currency)

"Note" The credit of legal tender in Tianjin is high. According to yesterday's market, legal tender is more expensive in Tianjin than in Shanghai. It is calculated that British currency is higher by 0.0625 pence per national currency yuan, and American currency is higher by 1875/100 yuan per national currency 100 yuan.

(Hong Kong) 27th Dispatch: The exchange rate opened this morning, compared to 11:30 a.m. yesterday, the British currency did not change, the American price shrank by 0.0625, and the Shanghai currency fell by 0.25 yuan. By 4 p.m., the American currency had lengthened by 0.0625, with the price being 28.75 yuan. The Shanghai currency rebounded by 0.25 yuan, with the price being 178.75 yuan. The opening price this morning is listed below:

British Currency 1 Shilling 2 pence 71875/100000

American Currency 28.6875 Yuan

Shanghai Currency 178.5 Yuan

(The Shanghai currency is the amount of Shanghai legal tender equivalent to 100% of Hong Kong currency)

### Securities: Bulls and Bears Evenly Matched in Domestic Bonds; Principal and Interest on the Hai River Bonds Paid on Schedule

The trend in the securities black market remains hovering. The bulls are still struggling. Some original bulls are exiting, while new bulls are also present, but the confidence is not as strong as before. Large investors are not pushing up prices as eagerly as before. There is a situation where one side is pushing up prices while the other side is selling. For many days, number 38 has been consistently selling, and spot goods are flowing out steadily, which is noteworthy. The selling sentiment from the Northern brokers is quite strong. Numbers 14, 35, and Defu are all constantly selling. The trend is expected to continue hovering downwards. Yesterday's developments: the opening was firm due to buying by Tiansheng, Tongkang, and other firms, followed by fatigue due to selling by the Northern brokers. Although Zhenkang, Maotai, Hongda, and number 42 had some demand in the middle, number 38, Zhifeng, Xieda, and Runli continued to sell. Type A closed slightly lower at 1.1 yuan. In the afternoon, number 20 had buying, still struggling to push up prices. Numbers 5, 38, 41, and Tongsheng all had selling. Retail investors also had more buying than selling. Market prices rebounded by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The final result of market prices was slightly better by 0.1-0.2 yuan, except for Type A, which was slightly lower by 0.05 yuan. The total trading volume was estimated at about 700,000-800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Stock trading: 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 6.675 yuan.

Tianjin Communication: The short-term public bonds for dredging the Hai River in Hebei Province, guaranteed by the 8% surtax on the customs duties collected by the Tianjin Customs, were issued in April of the 14th year of the Republic of China, totaling 4 million yuan, with a term of 10 years and a monthly interest rate of 8%. Principal and interest were repaid once every year on April 20 and October 20. April 20 of this year is the date for full repayment. The total of 200,000 yuan of principal and 9,600 yuan of interest, totaling 209,600 yuan of legal tender, has been paid on schedule by the Pingjin Central and Jiaotong Banks.

The Shanghai Public Industry Association reported: The market is sluggish, but the underlying potential is good. Sellers are holding back, and people are paying close attention to various reports regarding Japan's attitude. In this time of European conflict, the obstacles to market progress can be eliminated. Jardine Matheson shares closed with a buying price of 20.01 yuan and a selling price of 20.03 yuan. Trading volume was minimal. Other stocks are also in the same situation. Prices of raw rubber in London and New York have risen slightly, and there have been slight inquiries about local rubber stocks.

London British Far East Companies' stock market quotations on the 26th of this month (Wednesday): all stocks were neutral. London Chinese foreign debt market quotations on the 27th of this month (Wednesday): only the Crisp Loan rebounded by half a pound, with a price of 35.5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

### Sugar Market: Manufacturers Repurchase Short-Term Futures, Dutch Sugar Rises Again, Local Refined White Sugar Follows Suit

Yesterday, Dutch raw white sugar's price rose strongly because producers in the region, through Jardine Matheson in Shanghai, repurchased 7,300 bags of June raw white sugar at a price of about 9.10 Dutch guilders. Therefore, sentiment was even more bullish. In the guild's trading, 24 raw white sugar spot goods at the warehouse initially traded at 26.8 yuan, then called for 27 yuan. Transit goods rose 0.35 yuan, rising to 18.7 yuan. Jardine Matheson's "B" mark bagged sugar at the eastern warehouse traded at 26 yuan, with 100 bags traded. The western warehouse traded 300 bags at 26.35 yuan, OW mark at 26.15 yuan, CX mark at 26.05 yuan, DY mark at 25.9 yuan, HX mark at 25.75 yuan, H mark raw sugar at 17 yuan.

Dutch sugar production prices, according to reports, are 8.65 Dutch guilders for September, and 9.15 for July and August. Jardine Matheson's bagged white sugar for June has been sold out, and the July supply will not be available until next month, with a price of about 10.60 Hong Kong dollars.

Local refined white sugar's price also rose along with the frequent increase in raw granulated sugar prices. Zhenji No. 1 was 26.7 yuan, No. 2 was 16.2 yuan, No. 3 was 25.7 yuan, No. 4 was 25.2 yuan, No. 1 factory crystal sugar was 32 yuan, and Jingming crystal sugar was 33.5 yuan.

Yesterday, 3,230 bags of sugar were shipped from Shantou.

### Yarn and Cloth: Fueling the Flames, the Surge in Cotton Yarn is Unstoppable; Customer Sales are Strong: Peers Rampantly Accumulate and Overstock; Trading is Active: Totaling 4,765 Bales

The yarn market continues to rise, and the surge is very strong. Although the actual demand from Guangxi is less than before, Yunnan is also developing, and sentiment is unusually lively. Because the available supply of spot goods has been significantly depleted, general investors have a strong bullish outlook, so the momentum is even more robust. Trading among peers is very brisk. As for those who are cornering the market, they are buying even more aggressively due to the tense situation, adding more weight. The market then soared upwards. The 20-count Double Horse yarn is particularly hot, with new highs appearing one after another. However, Guangxi, which was the most active buyer the day before yesterday, has become less interested in buying because selling prices have been rising rapidly. However, the floating traders in the market, influenced by all kinds of rumors, are accumulating and overstocking even more rampantly and becoming even more excited. In the afternoon, buyers from Yunnan and other inland areas arrived in droves, the market tightened sharply, and the surge was very strong. The price of 20-count Special Jincheng has reached 420 yuan. Although trading in the market is active, a significant portion is factory sales.

Regarding the spot yarn situation, the market was calm at the opening this morning. Customers were not active, and the public expected a small correction, so the opening was down by 1.5 yuan, with the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn at 407.5 yuan. However, Hong Kong still had a small need, and prices rebounded. However, large-scale transactions were still lacking, so although it rose to 409 yuan in the middle, the warehouse price was 401.5 yuan. Before long, certain individuals suddenly started manipulation, and prices suddenly fell. A few brokers were calling out in the market, "Do you want Double Horse? Only selling for 401.5 yuan!" Unexpectedly, they fell into someone's trap. By the time of the close, the price surge started again. In an instant, the spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 410.5 yuan, and the warehouse price was 403.7 yuan, a rise of over 2 yuan in an instant. In the afternoon, purchasing from Yunnan and other inland areas suddenly increased, and the market continued to advance. According to statistics, all buyers in the day totaled 4,765 bales. The prices of 20-count Tiannu Double Horse rose by 3-4 yuan, and other yarns rose by 2-3 yuan. The factories opened: Tongyi Factory opened 100 bales of 10-count Golden Rooster at a price of 325 yuan, 245 bales of 20-count Golden Rooster at a price of 402-403 yuan, Yong'an Factory opened 100 bales of 10-count Special Jincheng at a price of 348 yuan, Chongxin Factory opened 350 bales of 20-count Dafa at a price of 384 yuan, 360 bales of 10-count Dafa at a price of 322 yuan, Anda Factory opened 300 bales of 20-count Flying Tiger at a price of 412 yuan, from June to August. Today, 470 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin, 5 pieces to Xiamen, 405 pieces to Shantou, and 530 pieces to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by each group are listed separately on the left:

Peers 1,505 Hong Kong 230

Inland 1,010 Yunnan 1,720

Sichuan 200 Tianjin 215

Shantou 205 Statistics totaling 4,765

The Japanese yarn market remains firm as before, with the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn at 378 yuan, and 382 yuan for next month, still up about 2 yuan from the previous day.

### Chinese Cloth Should Use Chinese Yarn: Chinese Factory Yarn is Like a Prisoner in Jail; Japanese Factory Yarn is Like a Tiger Released from Its Cage; Hoarding for Speculation Does Not Help National Production; The Resurgence of the Price Surge is Due to Many Factors

The long-sluggish yarn market suddenly surged again in the past two days. The reason for this is that frequent good news has boosted morale, and the date of victory is getting closer and closer. As a result, the Japanese yen has plummeted, counterfeit currency has fallen sharply, and those in Tianjin who hold Japanese and counterfeit currency have turned to Shanghai to buy Japanese factory yarn and cloth in large quantities. As a result, Japanese yarn and cloth have risen quite sharply, and the demand for Chinese factory products has become more urgent. Now, let's explore the reasons for the price surge:

1.  The price difference between 10-count coarse yarn, 32-count single yarn, 42-count double-ply yarn, and 20-count yarn is becoming increasingly narrow. Some yarn factories see that coarse yarn has high profits and sells well, so they have slightly changed their spindles. All of the factory's futures have already been booked and bought up by the northern Tianjin group. At the same time, Ningbo Hefeng Factory specializes in spinning coarse yarn. Since the river blockade, the source has been cut off. Only yesterday did the Ende ship bring 1,200 bales, but it was still not enough.

2.  In the previous month, the amount of 4-count, 5-count, 6-count, and 8-count yarn spun by Chinese factories was very large. According to surveys, it was about 50,000-60,000 bales, with delivery dates now extending to May, June, July, August, and September. It is said that the factory's profit on this cotton yarn is higher than other yarns, but the yarn merchants' profits are even greater.

3.  Recently, Japanese yarn has been rising step by step, with a great upward trend. The reasons for this are: First, those who sold short in Qingdao's transactions suffered heavy losses, so they turned to Shanghai, regardless of everything, rampantly accumulating and overstocking. Second, with the decline of Japanese and counterfeit currency in North China, buyers are also buying Japanese yarn in large quantities in Shanghai. Therefore, in two or three weeks, it has jumped 30-40 yuan. The 20-count Blue Phoenix and Water Moon have seen new highs since the war. It is said that the Shanghai group has suffered huge losses this time, with few earning profits. The Tianjin and Qingdao groups have made a full profit and returned home.

4.  After the sharp rise in Japanese yarn, it has affected Chinese yarn. The yarn from Tianjin Beiyang and Hengyuan, two Chinese factories, has been squeezed out of the market by Japanese yarn and can only be transported south to find a way out. Unexpectedly, compared with Japanese yarn recently, this yarn is much cheaper (the selling price is all based on exchange rates), and it is even more cost-effective to remit. Therefore, the Tianjin group, with their quick wits, has collected 20-count Three Rings Eight Immortals 17-count Three Rings, etc., and loaded them back to their hometown. After their sweep, market prices have naturally tightened.

5.  Based on the above situation, the price of 20-count local yarn is the cheapest. General speculators focus on this. The wealthy are hoarding it. Therefore, in recent times, although the Oujiang area in eastern Zhejiang has been automatically blockaded, and shipping has been stopped, and Japanese warships have gathered in the southern Fujian and coastal areas, and there has been constant unrest, yarn and cloth have not been attacked, but have been able to stand in a stable situation, repeatedly advancing and retreating at the 400 yuan mark for a long time. In the past two days, there has been a sudden price surge again.

6.  The inland Guangxi group has not been buying for a long time, but recently the demand has risen slightly, and they are mainly buying 20-count Double Horse, followed by Tiannu Special Jincheng. Therefore, the long-accumulated 20-count yarn has now been supported by actual transactions, resulting in a sharp rise. General speculators are spreading rumors in the market, fueling the flames, making it even more intense. However, actual sales are strong, and spot goods are temporarily in short supply, so prices are naturally rising. However, the surge in prices is too strong, hindering the development of actual sales. As for the medium-quality 20-count yarn, that is, the products of newly established yarn factories, the prices are 10+ yuan cheaper, but sales are still sluggish. According to people in the industry, there is still a possibility that the price of 20-count yarn will rise in the future, because the price of Japanese yarn is high, and inland groups are changing to Chinese and British products to make a greater profit. The general public must look at 420 yuan. However, the price of 10-count coarse yarn has reached 350 yuan for medium-quality goods. Thinking in terms of comparison, it cannot be said to be cheap. However, other factories do not spin it, and there is demand from the north. However, after checking the amount purchased by the group and the amount opened by the peers, it is also quite a lot.

The reasons for the price increase are as such, but seeking the actual situation, I am afraid it is not permissible to be optimistic. It is said that Chinese yarn is stored in warehouses by general speculators and wealthy individuals, amounting to 80,000 bales, killing huge amounts of capital, igniting speculative price surges, expanding the sales of Japanese yarn, and increasing the cost of Chinese cloth. All of this is because hoarders only care about their own interests, making Chinese yarn seem like a prisoner in jail, and Japanese yarn like a tiger released from its cage. If this is not changed, the yarn of Chinese factories will never be able to compete with Japanese yarn, and weaving factories will only sell Japanese yarn. Then, how can the cloth they weave be called Chinese cloth? If Chinese merchants truly know the importance of the matter, they should make Chinese cloth factories use Chinese yarn, which is the greatest benefit, and not hoard for speculation.

### There is a Saying that U.S. Cotton Has Subsidies for Domestic Sales: Local Indian Cotton Deliveries Are Getting Busier; The Spot Price of Fire Machine Cotton Fell by 5 Jiao Yesterday

The foreign cotton market: the New York cotton market was relatively quiet in the early morning. Later, due to the increasing number of people talking about U.S. cotton export subsidies, there was a rumor yesterday that the government, due to strong opposition to export subsidies, planned to first implement domestic cotton sales subsidies, and then export subsidies after success. This led to short covering, and banks and peers bought in droves. As a result, cotton prices rose sharply by 11 pound-sounds. Yesterday, India rose by 3 rupees, Egypt rose by more than 10 pound-sounds, and Liverpool spot prices rose sharply by 10 pound-sounds. Converting to legal tender, U.S. cotton rose by 1 yuan, Indian cotton rose by 1.2 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by 2 yuan.

Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai: although yarn prices have been rising recently, factories have not been ordering in large quantities. Yesterday, because foreign cotton prices were too high, no transactions were heard from any factories. There have been many foreign cotton deliveries recently. The Belochistan cotton that each cotton firm ordered earlier has also arrived in Shanghai one after another, so if factories are short of goods, they can also purchase spot goods from the cotton firms at any time, which is still convenient. The following is a record of yesterday's cotton market price converted to factory delivery price:

Local cotton business remains scarce, and selling prices have fallen slightly. The price of Fire Machine cotton has fallen by 0.5 yuan, and factory demand is very sluggish. This is because the foreign cotton ordered by the factories has already been arriving in Shanghai, so the factories do not worry about running out of supplies. Therefore, transactions in local cotton are very quiet. However, the sources from all directions are still cut off, and the degree of decline is slow. The fundamental problems of the cotton market are not interesting. There are only 198 bales of Sutong cotton from northern Jiangsu, and Zhejiang cotton arrived in Shanghai on the Ende ship, bringing more than 6,300 pieces. Also, today's exports include 60 pieces of cotton shipped to Shantou. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:

### Piece Goods: Avoiding Losses from the Sharp Decline in "Counterfeit Currency," Tianjin Merchants in Shanghai are Changing to Hoard Cloth; Eastern Cloth Has Been Repeatedly Creating New Prices; Dyeing Factories Choose to Use National Cloth to Reduce Costs

National Cloth: Cotton yarn is allowed, Eastern Cloth is up. The price surge is stronger, and sentiment is excited. Higher quality fine cloths, such as Da Peng, Fugui, Cannon, and Ming Yu brands, are cheaper in the current market than Eastern Xushe, and are suitable for dyeing blanks, so dyeing factories are eagerly adopting them. A certain bank transports and sells Da Peng, Fugui, and other brands of fine cloth to Kunming. Currently, because the required amount is insufficient, the factory's price has increased, so it is actively collecting from peers. The existing stock in the market is empty. The morning market selling price of each piece has risen by 0.05 yuan, and it has risen by 0.1 yuan again in the afternoon. Over 100 bales of fine cloth were traded, and buyers from northern Jiangsu and Guangdong and Fujian bought 100 bales. The factory price of fine twill has risen by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Dyeing factories have less demand, so although the selling price has increased, the actual transactions are still small. Only Guangdong buyers bought 50-60 bales of Ai Zi and other lower-grade brands. The market for Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth is also tight. Inexpensive handheld goods have gradually become scarce after being continuously collected by peers. The price of Dasheng Zhenzhong Factory's 16-pound goods has risen by 0.1 yuan, and the price of various Chinese factory 11-pound and 9-pound goods has risen by 0.05 yuan. Over 200 bales have been absorbed by local merchants and hoarders. The selling price of bleached and dyed cloth Xushe has also risen repeatedly due to the increased price of grey cloth. New transactions are difficult to negotiate. Southwest Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong buyers are actively transporting various colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, poplin, and striped bleached cloth, all of which are cheap. The local street's shipments are also mostly used to obtain fixed orders for grey cloth and finished products. The guerrilla zone has the strongest demand from the Bengbu gang, with colored cloth and colored twill being the most popular, with thousands of pieces being transported every day.

Eastern Cloth: White goods have continued to be actively purchased by northern buyers, and fine cloth and fine twill have repeatedly reached new highs. Yesterday, 12-pound Caiqiu fine cloth was sold for 14 yuan per piece for next month, and the spot price was 13.8 yuan. Other brands, such as Longtou, Yanghe, Shuangyu, Feiyu, Blue Rooster, and Laba, have all soared, creating new prices. Futures are higher than spot goods, with each piece increasing by 0.2-0.25 yuan. Tianjin buyers have been buying heavily, buying about 2,000 pieces of various fine cloth and fine twill. Qingdao buyers have also been buying about 1,000 pieces. Local street peers have also been dyeing nearly 1,000 pieces. Foreign firms have ordered 1,700-1,800 pieces of fine cloth for next month's futures. The shortage of fine twill has reached the point where there are no goods to sell. The prosperity of the market is truly rare. It is said that the counterfeit "Federal Reserve Certificate" in Tianjin has plummeted, and people are shaken. Tianjin merchants have too much floating capital, so they are all hoarding goods in Shanghai to prevent losses. Although purchases have been strong recently, the actual amount of goods shipped north is not seen much.

Exports: Today's (28th) exports of piece goods include 114 pieces shipped to Qingdao, 165 pieces shipped to Tianjin, 25 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 55 pieces shipped to Shantou, and 360 pieces shipped to Hong Kong.

### Grains and Food - Native Flour Sales Not Stagnant, Selling Prices Consistently Firm

Factory Flour: Yesterday, spot transactions at domestic factories were still active. Although there were fewer bulk transactions from merchant guilds after days of activity, retail sales were not weak. This was because North China merchant guilds were hesitant to purchase in large quantities due to the significant fluctuations in Tianjin exchange rates. However, their appetite for lower-grade flour was particularly strong. Retail sales by Southeast Asian merchant guilds were also brisk. A total of 50,000 to 60,000 bags were transacted in the market, with the selling price of some No. 3 and No. 4 flour being firm, mainly due to the current low inventory levels at various factories. The standard price for No. 2 flour remained at 4.45 yuan per bag for local merchants. Prices for lower-grade mixed brands varied slightly, and the market was brewing. According to investigations, 8,000 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin today, along with 5,800 bags to Xiamen, 22,000 bags to Shantou, and 500 bags of bran to Hong Kong.

Foreign Flour: The market was stable yesterday. New arrivals were temporarily scarce, and the amount of goods circulating in the market remained low. Transactions by local merchants were brisk, so mid-range brands maintained a price of 4.45 yuan with exchange included, diverging from the prices of domestic flour factories.

Wheat: Transactions remained slow yesterday. Flour factories have already received a new shipment of wheat. Their need for local wheat is not as strong. It is reported that recently arrived wheat from Beijing and Zhenjiang is mostly sent directly to factories or distributed to certain parties. The price is around 6.80 yuan, but the asking price in the market is still around 7 yuan. Although there are no open transactions in the regular market, the informal market is trending towards loosening.

### Oil Cakes - Raw Soybean Oil Trading Only for Speculation Yesterday, Arrivals Continuous, Prices Declining

Yesterday, raw soybean oil initially continued the momentum from the previous day, with rumors circulating that Japan needed foreign exchange. Therefore, the market sentiment felt quite firm. However, as the day progressed, due to the continuous arrivals and weak actual sales, the market only saw speculative trading. As a result, manipulation tactics failed to materialize, and prices declined across the board. The initial transaction involved 50 pieces of newly arrived Jiaozhou raw oil at 38.20 yuan, followed by 200 pieces of spot transactions at 39.30 yuan. Forty pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were sold at 33.50 yuan. Two hundred barrels of Dalian spot soybean oil fell from 47.50 yuan to 46.50 yuan. One hundred pieces of Dalian large baskets were traded at 44.50 yuan.

On the 27th, 379 bags of soybeans were exported to Hong Kong and 230 bags to Xiamen.

### Imports and Exports - Ende Vessel Carries Wheat to the South, Loads Cotton Yarn and Yellow Wine

Since Zhenhai, Japan, banned ships from entering and exiting on the 5th of this month, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been interrupted, causing freight transport to halt. It is now known that the former Sino-Italian company's Ende vessel, chartered by the German merchant Taifeng Flour Mill, loaded 16,500 bags of foreign wheat in Shanghai to transport to Ningbo. With the approval of military authorities, it sailed to Ningbo on the 18th. After unloading, it returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. The vessel was allowed by military authorities in Ningbo to load over 21,300 pieces of cargo, including 6,070+ pieces of cotton, 275 pieces of wooden looms, 1,200 pieces of cotton yarn, 4,620 pieces of fresh eggs, 3,030 pieces of yellow wine, and over 5,100 pieces of local paper. The rest were miscellaneous goods such as straw hats and straw mats, as well as 125 pieces of silk.

Additionally, 1,066 tons of tobacco leaves arrived from New York yesterday. Today (the 28th), 230 pieces of local paper will be shipped to Qingdao.

### Letter - Oil Mill Association Statement Regarding the Origin of Raw Materials for Dayouyu Oil Cakes

To the esteemed editor of the Shenbao:

Regarding the question of the origin of soybean cakes mentioned in the commercial news section of your esteemed newspaper Xichang today, which involves whether the raw materials produced by the Dayouyu factory are domestic, we hereby clarify that this factory is a member of our association. Since the "August 13th" incident, all the soybeans used in the production of soybean cakes have been purchased from areas in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and Tongchonghai. The brokers involved include Yongfengchang, Yixiangfeng, Xinhe, Tairun, Shenyuanlai, and Yongshengchang, all of whom have documented records. The factory's raw materials have been limited to domestic products recently, resulting in daily production figures that are only one-tenth or one-twentieth of pre-war levels. If we were to follow what your esteemed newspaper published today, the intention would be ambiguous and could confuse the public. Therefore, we provide a detailed and truthful account in the hope that this letter will be published to correct any misinformation.

Sincerely,

Shanghai Oil Press Industry Association

Traditional Chinese Medicine and Diet Therapy

### Intestine-Moistening Foods

— Cao Xiwang

Constipation is a condition of utmost importance and significance concerning human health. Patients often experience mental discomfort and are at risk of developing other illnesses. The treatment should first differentiate between mild and severe cases. For severe cases, treatments like peach kernel oil or hemp seed oil are used. However, the former is too potent and can harm vital energy, while the latter, although mild, contains too much oil, which can impede stomach function. Therefore, the above-mentioned remedies are not suitable for those with weak bodies, deficient stomachs, habitual constipation, or those with opium addiction-induced intestinal dryness. Only honey and trichosanthes root powder are peaceful in nature and have significant intestine-moistening effects. These are described as follows.

Honey: Its taste is sweet, harmonious, and non-toxic. Its functions include invigorating energy, tonifying the middle, nourishing the spleen and stomach, harmonizing nutrients, and moisturizing the internal organs. The ancient method of honey-based suppositories (this is extremely effective) is made by refining honey. Its intestine-moistening effect is self-evident. However, the above methods are all for external use. If changed to internal consumption, they are quite suitable for the elderly, those with weak bodies, and those with chronic diseases like habitual constipation. Furthermore, its sweet and fragrant taste is palatable and does not harm vital energy or damage the stomach. However, pure products are rare on the market, so be careful when purchasing. (Dosage) Three times a day, one spoonful each time, taken with warm water one to two hours after meals, or mixed with other foods.

Trichosanthes Root Powder (Gua Lou Gen): It is a root and stem-type plant, similar in shape to potatoes and yams. It tastes sweet, balanced, slightly sour, and has a slightly bitter, slightly cold nature. There are many records of its effects in medical books. However, its main functions are to generate fluids, quench thirst, moisturize dryness, nourish the stomach, and moisten the intestines for bowel movement, which is no less effective than honey. The most famous producing area of this product is Jiading, so the best ones are called Jiading Trichosanthes Root Powder. The products are divided into medicinal and edible types. For medicinal purposes, it is taken out of the mud, washed, peeled, and sliced before being used in medicine. For edible purposes, after washing and peeling, it must be immediately put into a mortar, mashed into juice, strained to remove the residue, and allowed to settle. After the juice has settled, it is dried in the sun and ground into a fine powder before it can be consumed. Regular consumption of this trichosanthes root powder is quite effective for those with weak bodies, weak stomachs, and chronic constipation. If you want to try it, you can inquire at a Southern Goods store. The method of consumption is the same as lotus root flour.

### Diet Therapy for Leukorrhea

— Zou Demin

Leukorrhea is almost a common disease among women. The pathological principles are mostly damp-heat pouring downward, and qi deficiency causing prolapse; or due to excessive sexual activity, the uterus contains sticky substances such as yellow pus, fish brains, or blood, flowing out from the reproductive organs. Those with excessive turbid heat are foul-smelling. Over time, they become haggard, suffer from lower back pain, weakened brainpower, memory loss, and even affect menstruation, hindering fertility, and entering a premature state of aging. It is truly the most protracted and evil disease in the female world.

The quality and quantity of leukorrhea also vary. A small amount is harmless to health, but a large amount is a sign of disease. The treatment of this disease by both Western and Chinese medicine can only reduce it, but there is no thorough solution. Although treatment relies on medicine, it is even more important to be self-aware, avoid overthinking, and moderate sexual activity. Now there is a long-term diet therapy method that can be told to patients: Use one tael each of Gorgon fruit and Coix seed, five qian of Rehmannia glutinosa, and ten red dates, stewed and eaten daily, as a snack. It is economical and convenient. Regular consumption for several months will definitely be effective. Gorgon fruit and Coix seed have the function of consolidating and are also products that seep out moisture. Rehmannia glutinosa and red dates are things that nourish blood and strengthen the spleen, so eating them is especially beneficial to the sick body.

### Manifestation, Color, and Normal Characteristics of Rubella - Favorable and Adverse Conditions and Dietary Dos and Don'ts

— You Xuezhu

Normal rubella can naturally manifest and, with the help of medication, the rash is easier to develop. After a fever, it can develop externally in three or four days. It first appears in front of and behind the ears, on the forehead, around the mouth, etc., and then gradually spreads down the body. The position of this rash on the skin is always consistent with the pores, that is, round nodules first appear on the pores, and then a red halo gradually develops from the solid nodules. This red halo is always slightly raised above the surrounding skin, so when touched with the hand, the skin in the rash area can be felt to be less smooth than healthy skin. The small nodules and the red halo together form a circular rubella rash, about the size of a hemp seed, hence the name measles.

Our pores are countless, but the development of rubella does not cause all pores to develop rashes. It has been heard that if a part of the pores are all covered with rashes, they must be densely packed together, creating an abnormal shape. Since the pores of Wu people are very close, the rashes are connected together and form spots and patches. If the small rash has a normal color, it is not a major problem. If it is flat or has mottled textures, as if the whole body is covered with red clouds, the internal heat is already very high, and there may be convulsions. The treatment focuses on clearing and resolving. Gypsum, scrophularia, forsythia, trichosanthes root, anemarrhena, ophiopogon, scutellaria, and pueraria can all be used as appropriate. Therefore, drinks should also be cooling. Reed root, red sugarcane, orange juice, honeysuckle dew, and artemisia annua dew can all be taken. The heat of this syndrome is related to the accumulation in the stomach and intestines, so food should be prohibited, otherwise it will be like adding oil to a fire, or adding fuel to a boiling pot, and the momentum will increase. There is also a type of rubella rash that looks like blisters, and the symptoms are chest tightness, vomiting of clear water, and warm body. This is due to blood circulation disorders or dietary indiscretions. Improper handling, chest fullness, abdominal distension, and tight blood vessels will cause the water in the blood to often penetrate the blood vessels and seep into the rubella rash, becoming blister-like. Because of its high heat, the focus is also on clearing heat, and add Spikemoss, Saposhnikovia, and Mustard Flower; if due to dietary indiscretions, then focus on digestion, Gallus gallus domesticus, Radish Seed, Charred Hawthorn, Tangerine Peel, and Hordeum germinatum are necessary.

Rubella and smallpox have different causes and different diagnoses. Even in terms of color, the diagnostic methods are very different. In general, smallpox is afraid of bright red, the skin is tender and easily broken, and it must cause itching; rubella rash is most fond of being red, the redder the color, the more completely the toxin is released, which is a positive sign. If the spirit is weak and the color of the rash is pale and not bright red, it is a sign of insufficient heart blood. If treatment is not sought early, it will become convulsive in acute cases, and develop into consumption in chronic cases. The treatment is based on Angelica sinensis, Rehmannia glutinosa, Carthamus tinctorius, and aged tangerine peel to benefit and activate blood. In terms of diet therapy, red beans with ginger, decocted and taken as a soup, can still be appropriate, but only the soup can be sipped, and the red beans and heavy sediment should be discarded. If the color is too red, accompanied by constipation and dry lips and mouth, this is a sign of internal flaming fire and extreme heat. At this time, the stomach's acceptance is not open, and there is no need to explore fifteen food matters. Cooling drinks, taking more of them is also harmless. If not treated early, internal heat will be extreme and cause bleeding. The rubella rash will turn from purple to black, and it will be difficult to save. In terms of beverages, orange juice should be taken more, mung bean peel decoction and cold drinks, or honeysuckle dew can also be taken; however, a cup of water can't extinguish a burning cart of firewood, it is really not enough to stop the raging flames. A large dose of Rhinoceros horn and Rehmannia decoction may offer a chance of salvation.

### Stomach Qi Disease

— Gu Zongwen

Stomach Qi pain is a disease that can be caused by anger or excessive smoking and drinking, leading to dysfunction of the spleen and stomach. Symptoms include fullness and pain in the epigastrium and abdomen, belching, nausea, acid regurgitation, inability to eat, and increased pain upon eating. This is what Western medicine calls "hyperacidity." Recently, patients suffering from stomach Qi disease often take sodium bicarbonate. It can indeed relieve pain after taking it, but it soon recurs. Sodium bicarbonate contains an alkaline effect. After taking it, it neutralizes the excessive stomach acid, so it can immediately stop the pain. However, after a few days, the stomach acid increases again, and the pain recurs. To seek thorough treatment, one must first use medication to calm the liver and regulate Qi, so that the liver and stomach are harmonized, and the disease will naturally recover. However, patients must also be self-aware and pay attention to self-care and diet therapy, so that it will never recur.

Prohibiting all miscellaneous foods is the first thing that patients with stomach Qi pain must pay attention to. Even the proper daily food intake should be reduced. At most, eat two small bowls each time. The food can be completely digested and obtain all its nutrients. Do not overeat arbitrarily, and damage the spleen and stomach again. Since the stomach is weak, it naturally cannot digest hard foods, so it is advisable to eat porridge. If there is burnt rice porridge, it is even better, because its taste is more fragrant and can open the appetite, and it is also easier to digest after being stir-fried, but this porridge should not be too thin, because it contains too much water and easily causes stomach acid to rise. As for the vegetables eaten on weekdays, bean and tofu skin are generally better, always taking alkaline foods. All irritating and spicy, raw, and cold foods must be absolutely prohibited. On weekdays, you can use Buddha's hand or Citrus aurantium to make tea, to relieve chest and abdomen discomfort. After several months or half a year, the spleen and stomach gradually recover, and the appetite also increases. Then you can eat rice and slightly loosen the restrictions, but you should not be too angry or worried, so as not to destroy all previous efforts.

Eat less and taste more, eat more and hurt your belly: choose to eat to nourish your body, eat indiscriminately and hurt your health.

### Decoction of Medicine

— Zhang Luo

Patients often neglect the matter of decocting medicine, but if it is not decocted properly, the efficacy of the medicine will easily disappear, and it is necessary to provide guidance to servants who decoct the medicine.

In general, for those with internal injuries, the medicine should be decocted with a low flame for a long time, because it contains more products that nourish vital energy. If decocted for a short time, the efficacy of the medicine cannot be exerted. For those with external infections, it should be decocted with a high flame to a boil, and it should not be decocted for a long time, because its medicine is mostly aromatic and penetrating, and it will lose its efficacy if it is left for a long time. If the prescription contains pills, powders, or loquat leaves, Inula flower, etc., they should all be wrapped and decocted to prevent the decoction from becoming too turbid and difficult to swallow, and to prevent micro-hairs from choking into the throat. Salts such as Mirabilitum and Sodium Sulfate should be boiled and filtered, and impurities should be removed. Antelope horn and agarwood powder should not be added to other medicines for decoction, but should be taken by infusion. American ginseng and ginseng should be decocted and infused separately to avoid the loss of medicinal juice. Other medicines such as those that require "boiling first" and "adding later" should also be noted: such as keel and oyster shells, which are solid in texture, their medicinal flavor is not easy to decoct out, and should be boiled first and then added to other medicines for decoction; and fragrant medicines such as mint, amomum, cardamom, agastache, and eupatorium should be added later, and remove from heat as soon as it boils. The author believes that doctors must provide detailed notes when prescribing prescriptions, and patients must follow them, so that efforts will be multiplied with half the effort.

### Table Salt

— Ding Shicheng

Table salt is one of the necessities for mankind. In addition to flavoring and curing, it can also be used to treat various pain illnesses. For example, for those suffering from heel pain, joint pain, neuralgia, etc., one or two pounds of table salt can be soaked in a large pot of boiling water. After the water is warm and suitable, immerse the painful part in it while it is still hot, until the water is cold. Do this every day. In two to three months, the illness will heal itself. If the pain is in the stomach or other parts that cannot be immersed in water, the salt can be stir-fried until hot, tied tightly with white cloth, and then slowly rubbed over the painful area. Re-stir-fry until cold (one person stir-fries, one person rubs), and iron it. On one trip, there was snow on the road. After walking for several miles, I finally met a boat. I had not changed my wet shoes and socks all night. Within a few months, I suffered from knee pain, which was soft and weak, making it difficult to walk, and the pain was endless. I took medicine for several months, but it was not eradicated. It often ached on holidays and cloudy days. A classmate, Mr. Mou, taught me a method: use two metal buckets, about five inches in diameter, one or two inches higher than the knee, pour hot salt water into them, and soak for one or two hours every night, without interruption. I felt that my whole body was steaming, sweating profusely, which was very comfortable, and I slept well. In less than two months, I recovered and have not relapsed in four years. Its efficacy is truly unbelievable.

### Maltose

— Zhang Ruwei

Maltose (i.e., malt extract) is sweet, warm, and tonifies the middle. It has a sticky, cohesive, and lubricating nature. Maltose boiled with glutinous rice is of good quality. It is excellent for those with weak middle qi, abdominal pain and disharmony, sallow complexion, emaciation, loose stools, and hoarse cough. China has used it since ancient times. Zhang Zhongjing's Xiao Jian Zhong Tang (Minor Construct the Middle Decoction) uses this as the main ingredient. Because the original prescription was Guizhi Jia Shaoyao Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction plus Peony), the addition of maltose changed its name to Jian Zhong (Construct the Middle). If maltose is removed and Astragalus is added, it is called Huangqi Jian Zhong Tang (Astragalus Decoction to Construct the Middle). It can be seen that maltose is the main medicine for Jian Zhong, not a supporting ingredient. Because it benefits Qi and nourishes blood, it has the clever effect of benefiting the middle and maintaining transformation. Qianjin Su Mi Gao (Thousand Gold Crispy Honey Paste) also uses maltose as the main ingredient, mainly to treat aphonia caused by Qi depletion. Today, maltose is difficult to purchase in Shanghai. It is advisable to inquire and purchase it.

### Talking About Milk Consumption

— Ding Jimin

Chinese people have not eaten this milk for thousands of years. Once they start eating this sweet, greasy, and fishy (some say fragrant) milk for the first time, it is inevitable that some people will react, even with constipation, stomach discomfort, bad breath, and diarrhea. Therefore, in my observation, the nature of milk is the same as that of Sun Simiao, neutral, without any hot or cold properties. What matters is whether the Chinese stomach is accustomed to it. Therefore, those who perceive it as hot will perceive it as hot, and those who perceive it as cold will perceive it as cold, which is each person's reaction.

Regarding the question of the nature of milk being cold or hot, and its nutritional value, a conclusion can be drawn here: those who are used to it can eat it as much as possible, and those who are not used to it may as well not eat it. Next, I will talk about the nutritional value of milk for patients.

In ancient times, we also had many prescriptions using milk to treat diseases, one of which is called Jiucai Zhi Niuruyin (Chive Juice Milk Drink). It is specially used to treat dysphagia and vomiting. Another one is called Wuzhiyin (Five Juice Drink), which uses six parts of milk and one part each of chives, lotus root, and pear juice, and has the same effect. Dysphagia and vomiting are mostly caused by eating raw things and dry food that cannot be swallowed and will naturally be vomited out. The above two prescriptions can nourish, moisturize, and provide waiting treatment. This is also very reasonable in light of modern nutrition science.

Many people who are weak and suffering from chronic diseases can eat milk; except for those who are not used to it (maybe they can get used to it if they eat it).

Ordinary people. Eating milk every day can indeed, as Sun Simiao said, replenish blood vessels, benefit the heart, and build muscle. The body is healthy, strong, and moisturized, the complexion is bright, and the spirit is not diminished. However, it must meet the conditions he said: "do not limit it for one day, and should allow it to be sufficient and abundant." (The End)
