### Fierce Battles Resume in Southern Shanxi: Approximately 10,000 Japanese Troops Between Yicheng and Jiang County Advance Southeast in Three Routes Under Air Cover; Hand-to-Hand Combat at Diaoshangou Results in a Major Chinese Victory

(Luoyang) The once-calm battle situation in southern Shanxi has resumed fierce fighting since the 6th. Approximately 10,000 Japanese troops between Yicheng and Jiang County are advancing southeast in three routes. One force, numbering 4,000 to 5,000, is advancing via Nanchangcun and Shipo. Another force of approximately 2,000 is advancing via Yangxuanmen and Shimen. A third force of nearly 2,000 is advancing via Diaoshangou. All are attacking fiercely under air cover. The Chinese troops on all lines are responding calmly. Particularly in the Diaoshangou area, the Chinese and Japanese armies engaged in intense hand-to-hand combat near Hejiazhuang, north of the 1805 elevation and the Mozi Mountain. The fierce battle lasted a day and night, resulting in numerous Japanese casualties. On the morning of the 7th, reinforcements from a certain unit of the Chinese army rushed from [unclear] to provide support. They have now occupied the Nanjia Village, the 496 elevation, and the Fengjiahe area. Except for a small number of remnants being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army at [unclear], the majority of the remaining Japanese troops have collapsed and fled towards Diaoshangou. The Chinese army is continuing to pursue and mop them up. Another group of Japanese troops advancing from Xuluyu towards Shimen launched a raid on the 6th at noon, with their vanguard troops reaching the Tunpingli area west of Shimen. A certain unit of the Chinese army is currently engaging them. In addition, 200 to 300 Japanese troops from Hengshui Ailicun launched an attack on a certain unit of the Chinese army at the foot of Dongshan Slope on the morning of the 6th, attempting to contain them. After a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and fled back along their original route. In summary, the battle situation in southern Shanxi is expected to see new developments within the next two to three days. (7th Dispatch)

Tongguan: The Chinese army in southern Shanxi, braving the rain on the 3rd, launched a surprise attack on Duancun (Anyi area), catching the Japanese troops off guard and rushing into the village. Fierce street fighting ensued, resulting in countless Japanese soldiers killed. After dawn, Japanese reinforcements arrived from Anyi. The Chinese army met them again, engaging in several rounds of intense combat, resulting in heavy Japanese casualties. The fierce fighting was still ongoing as of noon on the 5th. (8th Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) The strength of the Japanese troops on all battlefields is showing signs of exhaustion, and there are no major battles currently. Although there have been troop movements by the Japanese in southern Shanxi, it does not appear that their numbers have increased, suggesting no new intentions. There have been localized skirmishes in the Zhongtiao Mountain area. Our troops in southern Guangdong have gained a considerable advantage in their offensive. Japanese soldiers in various parts of North China are weary of war, and more than a dozen groups of puppet troops, large and small, have recently defected. (8th Special Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to information received here, there are currently five Japanese divisions in central China and Shanxi. In addition, five more divisions are en route to China. The Japanese are clearly planning a general offensive, as the recent lull on various fronts is due to a shortage of Japanese troops. Chinese military officials claim that the Chinese army has adopted large-scale counter-measures and is fully prepared. Guerrilla units in the guerrilla areas have recently been completely reorganized and their strength has been enhanced. In addition, new troops trained in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces have completed their training and have been dispatched to various fronts to participate in the counter-offensive. (8th Dispatch)

(Luoyang) After the Japanese troops in Yicheng and Jiang County launched a three-pronged offensive on the 6th, the Chinese and Japanese armies are still engaged in fierce fighting. Following a fierce battle and hand-to-hand combat at Diaoshangou, a major victory was achieved. Fengjiahe was recaptured in one fell swoop. On the afternoon of the 7th, Diaoyougou was also temporarily seized. However, due to continuous Japanese reinforcements and intense artillery fire, the Chinese army, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, has now shifted to the eastern highlands of Diaoshangou and is continuing to attack the remaining Japanese troops stubbornly resisting. The remaining Japanese troops surrounded at Xinglong'an have now been completely annihilated. (8th Dispatch)

(Luoyang) The recent great victory in Zhongtiao Mountain was achieved by the Chinese army adopting a "sausage-eating strategy." This saying came from a certain commanding officer who personally directed the operation and is particularly evocative. The Japanese army, numbering approximately 20,000, invaded Zhongtiao Mountain, resembling a string of sausages stretching across the mountain range. The Chinese army, unable to eliminate them entirely, decided to resolve the situation in segments, defeating them one by one, just like eating a sausage, slice by slice, cutting it into pieces and swallowing it. As a result, the Japanese army in southern Shanxi was eliminated. Prior to this, the Chinese army achieved the glorious victory of "opening the bag to catch rats" in northern Hubei. In this battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, the Chinese army once again annihilated the Japanese army using the "sausage-eating strategy," with the two achievements being comparable and complementing each other, truly a fine tale of the War of Resistance. (8th Dispatch)

Shaanzhou: Over 2,000 Japanese troops from Heshun in eastern Shanxi launched a two-pronged offensive southward on the 3rd. The Chinese army intercepted them along the way, inflicting heavy casualties. On the evening of the 4th, a unit of the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on Liyang, threatening the Japanese troops in Heshun. The Chinese army then launched a full-scale attack on the Japanese troops, engaging in a fierce battle for a day and night. The Japanese army left corpses all over the fields. The fierce fighting is still ongoing. (8th Dispatch)

### Guerrilla Units Southwest of Langfang Are Very Active

(Tianjin) The train that originated from Shenyang did not arrive here this morning. According to the Japanese military spokesman, the reason was that the tracks between Shenyang and Shanhaiguan were destroyed by mountain floods. However, the first train is expected to arrive here tonight. Furthermore, according to the spokesman, there are 1,000 guerrillas eight miles southwest of Langfang, between Beiping and Tianjin. The Japanese army is currently "mopping up" them. Moreover, according to the spokesman, the Japanese army here originally planned to conduct exercises last night, but they had to rush to the suburbs to deal with the guerrillas, and the exercises could not be held on time. It was also said that although the Japanese army has now been dispatched to deal with the guerrillas, in fact, it will still be in vain. (8th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: Several thousand guerrillas from a certain unit of the Chinese army have recently been active along the Pingjin Railway. On the 7th, they concentrated their forces and launched an attack on Langfang, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese army and advancing toward the railway line. Furthermore, over 200 guerrillas from a certain unit arrived in Tianjin on the 6th.

### Areas East of Nanlin Bridge Lost and Regained

Shanggao: On the morning of the 3rd, over a thousand Japanese soldiers, under the cover of machine guns and artillery, launched a fierce attack on Shentangpu, Tangxupu, and other places east of Nanlin Bridge. The Chinese army met them head-on, and the fighting was fierce. The Japanese army was killed by the Chinese army in large numbers. The fighting continued until 2:00 PM, when these locations fell into Japanese hands due to the disparity in numbers. On the morning of the 4th, Chinese reinforcements launched a counterattack and sent out a surprise force, flanking the rear of the Japanese army. The Japanese, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and fled. These locations were then recaptured. (8th Dispatch)

### Chen Yi Announces Blockade Countermeasures

(Fuzhou) Chairman Chen Yi recently announced blockade countermeasures, encouraging his subordinates and all compatriots in the province to work hard. The general idea is that the Japanese have recently stepped up their blockade of our seaports. We have now developed countermeasures, mobilized human, financial, and material resources, and will intensify our efforts in the future to exert the strong support of our protracted war strategy in military, political, and economic terms to resist the enemy's blockade tactics and prepare to crush any attempt they make. Four important tasks will be undertaken, with everyone working together diligently and quickly. (7th Dispatch)

Editorial

### Recent Disputes in Shanghai's Educational Circles

Recently, several disputes have occurred in Shanghai's educational circles: some involve mutual accusations over registration issues; others involve mutual ridicule over issues of legitimacy; some boast of their contributions while accusing others of plunder; and some flaunt their former status while regarding others as usurpers. Specific examples abound. When internal disagreements occur within educational institutions, outsiders unfamiliar with the inside story are unable to discern the truth, and the matter remains confined within the walls of the institution. However, when such disputes are published in newspapers and broadcast to the public, as in the case of the dispute over the preservation of school roots and the dispute between the main campus and branch campus of Yangzhong School, the facts are exposed, and society cannot help but pay due attention. Although Shanghai society is large, the impact of any turmoil in three or four schools is no more than a drop in the ocean. However, in the context of Chinese social customs, the actions of educational institutions are always under scrutiny. Moreover, in these recent times, when a dark atmosphere shrouds the isolated island and culture and education are under the constant surveillance of the enemy, these disputes in three or four schools could provide an opportunity for others to exploit vulnerabilities. If the forces of evil were to seize this opportunity, the entire future of education could face a crisis. We must be cautious and tread carefully, and we earnestly hope that these three or four schools will put the national interest first and handle the situation properly, taking care not to escalate the situation. Furthermore, other schools besides these three or four should take warning from these internal conflicts and not allow the solid foundation of Shanghai's educational circles, which has been built up since August 13th, to be gradually eroded.

We need not examine the specific details of the disputes in the three or four schools individually. Generally speaking, the matters disputed by these three or four schools mainly revolve around the issue of "legitimacy" versus "usurpation." The problem of legitimacy versus usurpation did not exist before the Chinese army withdrew from Shanghai, nor does it exist in other parts of Shanghai. Only in Shanghai at this time and place, where some municipal schools have transformed into private schools, and some inland schools have relocated to Shanghai as semi-public, semi-private schools, have disputes over legitimacy or usurpation arisen between the original schools and the new schools, which have adapted to the environment and adopted different names, and which have different personnel due to changes in time and space. However, all schools involved in this dispute have their own basis: some have preserved records as material evidence; others have gathered former personnel to demonstrate continuity; and some have even completed registration procedures, claiming that their certificates are sufficient to overwhelm the other party. In fact, these claims only represent the local history of the schools and do not necessarily constitute the basis for inheriting the school. Since the original school has been suspended, those who have not been ordered to relocate or re-establish cannot be considered as the continuation of the original school simply by gathering private individuals with connections. Even if the competent authority makes such an assumption due to special circumstances, the assumed entity is the entire school organization, not the private individuals who are currently in charge of this organization. However, what we see today is not a dispute between schools, but only a dispute between private individuals. Therefore, the so-called dispute over legitimacy versus usurpation in the current three or four schools is, in fact, quite hollow.

Moreover, the dispute over legitimacy versus usurpation is, in fact, unnecessary. If the competent authority has such an assumption, then which legal basis is sufficient only needs to be determined by the competent authority with a single word, and right and wrong can be distinguished in an instant. What is the purpose of the dispute? The current three or four schools do not consider this point at all, and still cling to their own arguments, as if their participation in the dispute is confident and fearless, or perhaps they believe that what they are arguing for is enough to reverse the assumption made by the competent authority in the past, so the current right and wrong can be ignored. Therefore, what they are fighting for is ostensibly a matter of legitimacy versus usurpation, but in reality, it is outside the issue of legitimacy versus usurpation. What they are fighting for is the division of personnel, using the issue of legitimacy as a superficial cover. In other words, the dispute over legitimacy is, in essence, a dispute over factionalism.

Factionalism is a very common phenomenon in social personnel matters, and education, which is not an isolated undertaking from society, is naturally not immune to it. However, in the past two years, Shanghai's educational circles have been supporting the precarious situation amidst the harsh environment, with more cultivation than harvest, so there has been no need for this dispute. However, in recent times, as school undertakings have developed rapidly and the harvest is no longer as meager as in the past, disputes have repeatedly occurred. However, today's China has not yet escaped the most difficult journey, and the national united front cannot allow even the slightest gap. Educational circles are knowledgeable pioneers, so how could they not understand this meaning? Therefore, leaving aside the issue of education itself, if we consider the interests of the country and the nation, could the current petty disputes not be resolved?

For the sake of the three or four schools, what should be noted at present is: first, instead of quibbling over the dispute over legitimacy, it is better to strive for self-improvement. On the one hand, gain the trust of society with real achievements, and on the other hand, establish their own legal status with legal procedures. It is good to inherit the system of public schools, and it is not bad to be a well-established registered private school. Second, instead of mutually criticizing, it is better to cooperate with each other, abandon prejudices, put aside factionalism, and jointly complete the great cause of education for the War of Resistance and national construction under the iron rule of the united front.

### Outer Mongolian Border Territory Captured; Intense Artillery Battles Between Japanese and Mongolian Forces; Nomonhan Highlands Turn to Scorched Earth; Mongolian Artillery Units Display Power With Nearly Every Shell Hitting

Reuters Correspondent Special Dispatch from the Front Lines on the Manchurian-Mongolian Border, 7th: The Nomonhan Highlands in the disputed area of Hailar have today become "no man's land" between the two armies. Outer Mongolian and Japanese troops have been firing artillery at it. After three days of battle, Japanese troops have occupied the most important Mongolian military position east of the Khalkhyn Gol River and have secured several crossing points. Mongolian infantry, assisted by artillery units, are fiercely resisting. The reporter witnessed the artillery battles between the two sides near the intersection of the Kustengeer and Khalkhyn Gol rivers today, as Japanese troops are eager to build bridges there. The range and direction of the Mongolian artillery units are extremely accurate. The reporter was forced to leave the observation point as the artillery fire intensified. Japanese aircraft have been very active throughout the day and have repeatedly bombed Mongolian artillery positions and transportation routes. The reporter witnessed the complete destruction of a Mongolian village, with flames soaring and residents fleeing in all directions, a very tragic scene. The reporter also saw Japanese bombers dropping bombs continuously near the intersection of the Kustengeer and Khalkhyn Gol rivers. Mongolian troops did not open fire with anti-aircraft guns. During the two days the reporter was at the front lines, the reporter only saw Mongolian aircraft passing over the Japanese positions once. They flew very high and, after circling briefly, flew back. According to Japanese claims, they have captured 100 enemy soldiers in the first three days of the war, as well as 10 tanks and some light and heavy machine guns. The reporter saw a small group of prisoners, including several Soviet soldiers and one Mongolian soldier, but could not speak to them. It is generally believed here that a large number of Soviet reinforcements are being transferred from garrisons in Siberia to the front lines. Currently, heavy rain is hindering transportation, and the air pressure is very low, so aircraft activity has decreased. All circumstances suggest that the current war will continue for an extended period of time.

Japanese War Report

(Tokyo) According to Japanese battlefield news, the commander of the Japanese air force base near Nomonhan is Lieutenant Colonel Kato. When the large "Heinkel" aircraft flew from Berlin to Tokyo in April of this year, Lieutenant Colonel Kato was the chief pilot of the aircraft. Now he is actively engaged in border air combat in the Nomonhan area, personally leading air units into battle. It is said that Lieutenant Colonel Kato directed the battles in which 97 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft were shot down on June 27th and 53 enemy aircraft were shot down on July 4th.

### Normal Diplomatic Relations Maintained Between Japan and Soviet Union

(Moscow) Although conflicts occur from time to time on the border between Outer Mongolia and Manchuria, Japan and the Soviet Union still maintain normal diplomatic relations. When Japanese Ambassador Shigenori Togo visited Soviet People's Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Solomon Lozovsky the other day, the discussion was limited to the dispute between Japanese commercial oil and coal mining companies on Sakhalin Island and the Soviet trade unions, and nothing else. In this regard, the Soviet court fined the companies 630,000 rubles because the quality of the goods supplied by the companies to the Soviet workers was inferior to that stipulated in the contract. The Japanese government has now acknowledged that the Soviet accusations are justified but has requested a reduction in the fine. (7th Havas Dispatch)

### Soviet Union Prepares to Hold Artillery Tactical Competition

(Moscow) The units of the Soviet Red Army are currently actively preparing to hold a competition on artillery tactics for the entire Soviet Union. According to a statement made by the Red Army Artillery Commander Voronov to the press, "The scale of this competition is unprecedented in the history of our Red Army. Participants will include all types of artillery, from small field guns to heavy artillery, everything that should be there. The results of the competition will be announced on September 15th, and the winners will be awarded various prizes." (7th Tass Dispatch)

### He Yingqin Claims Japanese Military Resources Dwindling; Casualties Reach Over 910,000; Chinese Military Strength Steadily Increasing

(Chongqing) According to a statement made today by Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japanese military casualties have reached 917,800, and 8,555 have been captured, which is the greatest success in China's war for national freedom. Furthermore, during the war, 716 Japanese aircraft have been shot down, and 644 Japanese ships have been sunk by the Chinese. Regarding the issue of military resources, He Yingqin stated that the Japanese can only mobilize 2.5 million people into combat units. In addition, 1,974,000 people are only used to replenish the first line, second line, and garrison reserves. The Japanese are currently deploying 31 divisions in China, 8 divisions in Manchuria, and 2 divisions in Korea. There are 6 and a half divisions in Japan, all of which cannot be mobilized. Although Japan can still mobilize 17 divisions, they must be used to counter the Soviet Union. From this, it can be seen that Japan's military resources are approaching exhaustion. As for China, military strength is steadily increasing. Furthermore, China can use all of its strength to deal with Japan, but Japan definitely cannot use all of its strength to deal with China.

### Regarding the Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in Tokyo: Kato's Statement, Need to Discuss the Entire Concession Issue, But Britain Claims to Only Discuss the Tianjin Incident, France Pays Close Attention to Future Situation

(Tokyo) Political circles and public opinion here have issued increasingly sharp comments on the upcoming Anglo-Japanese talks. According to a statement by Kato, the leader of the Japanese delegation, "The true importance of the Anglo-Japanese talks lies in discussing the entire issue of foreign concessions in China." Kato declared that for the past two years, Japan's military actions in China have been constantly hindered by anti-Japanese elements within foreign concessions, especially in Shanghai and Tianjin. If the British concessions in China are not subjected to the strictest control, there will never be peace. The demonstration declaration by representatives of various groups is even more resolute in its anti-British attitude. Today, the "National Farmers and Workers United Association" paraded and demonstrated in front of the British Embassy, shouting slogans, and its resolution was "Warning Britain to fundamentally revise its anti-Japanese Far East policy." The "Tokyo Student Union" also sent a resolution with the same content to the British Ambassador Craigie. Various newspapers hope that the Tokyo talks will be a turning point in Anglo-Japanese relations. (8th, Haitong News Agency)

(Tokyo) Colonel Shimizu, Director of the Japanese Army Intelligence Department, declared to reporters yesterday that since the foreign concessions in China have adopted a hostile attitude towards Japan, Japan is determined to take effective measures. The Japanese government has always avoided any anti-British propaganda or demonstrations, hoping that Britain can understand Japan's goals and position. Now Japan's patience has reached its limit. In the history of Anglo-Japanese relations, the Japanese people have never harbored such great jealousy towards Britain as they do today. Shimizu continued, Japan will never succumb to British threats or sanctions in order to implement its Far East policy. If Britain continues to hold this attitude and proceeds with Anglo-Japanese negotiations, he dares to assert that the negotiations will break down immediately. (8th, Haitong News Agency)

(London) According to government sources last night, if the Japanese side raises wide-ranging issues in this Anglo-Japanese negotiation, the British side will definitely reject them. The British side believes that this negotiation can only involve the Tianjin incident. Furthermore, if the Japanese side insists on discussing broad issues, the British side will inform them that they cannot be discussed without the participation of the United States and France, as the interests of the United States and France in China are the same as those of Britain. The British side will guarantee that the British concession in Tianjin will never become an anti-Japanese base. Regarding the issue of maintaining China's currency system, the British side will not discuss it unless the United States and France also participate. (8th, Associated Press)

(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese Tianjin incident negotiations will begin next Friday. Representatives of the Japanese army in Tianjin are currently consulting with the military authorities in Tokyo on the incidents to be raised during the negotiations, and they have been quite busy recently. This kind of meeting will take place throughout the day today, and tomorrow and Monday, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military authorities will hold long meetings. Foreign Minister Arita will report on the various circumstances that led to this Anglo-Japanese meeting at the regular cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, and will request cabinet approval of his policy for handling the Tianjin incident. Arita will draft an agenda and will likely invite the British Ambassador to the ministry this afternoon to discuss the matter and the final details of the meeting. (8th, Reuters)

(Paris) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is closely monitoring the development of the Far East situation. According to reports received here, when the British and Japanese authorities conduct negotiations in Tokyo, the Japanese side intends to discuss the Tianjin British Concession incident and also involve the current system of general concessions. If this is true, the United States and France should come forward to intervene, so as to avoid setting a precedent that would be detrimental in the future. Furthermore, according to news from Tianjin, although the blockade there is very strict, the food supply to the French Concession is still satisfactory. (8th, Havas News Agency)

(Tianjin) According to Japanese sources here today, anti-British gatherings of residents here were held in areas controlled by the Gan side. One gathering was held in the Chinese area, and another gathering was held in the First Special District. (8th, Associated Press)

### Japanese Plane Attacked Chongqing, Bomb Fell Near British Warship, Japan Expressed Apology

(Chongqing) According to the British Embassy, yesterday when Japanese planes bombed Chongqing, they nearly hit the British gunboat "Cricket". The Japanese side has now expressed apologies to the British side. It is said that when Japanese planes bombed Chongqing, the British warship's anti-aircraft gun team responded with anti-aircraft guns, but at the time they could not see where the Japanese planes were, so they did not counterattack. (8th, Associated Press)

Ottawa, Canada. Regarding the case of Reverend and Mrs. Caswell of the Canadian Holiness Church in Changde, Hunan Province, China, who were bombed to death by Japanese military aircraft on June 24, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Canadian Embassy on the 6th of this month, expressing apologies and promising compensation. This place has now followed the order of Federal Prime Minister Mackenzie King and announced the original text of the note, which roughly says, "The Japanese aircraft pilot, due to poor visibility, failed to recognize the national flag painted on the roof of the Holiness Church, thus causing this unfortunate incident." (8th, Havas News Agency)

### British Sailor Winterbottom Released

(Hankou) Winterbottom, the chief mate of Taikoo's Changsha ship, who was arrested by Japanese military police on July 5, was unconditionally released at 10:30 this morning. The British Consul-General, Weightman, protested strongly to the Japanese authorities because the Japanese side detained Winterbottom for three days without notifying the British Consulate. Today, a Reuters reporter met with Winterbottom. According to Winterbottom, at 3:00 AM on July 5, he did not know the roads in Hankou, so he asked for directions at a Chinese home. However, several Chinese people drove him out without asking why. He argued with them, causing the Chinese to knock over a table. They then summoned Japanese sentries who detained him in a small house in the concession area. Later, he was transferred to a very dirty room in the Chinese city, where he was detained with 20 Chinese people. He only received one meal a day. The next day, he was taken to the Japanese military police office in the concession. The Japanese side asked him to sign a statement stating that he had gone to this Chinese home for three consecutive nights. Because he had not been there except that night and had facts to prove it, he refused to sign. Finally, he wrote an apology, expressing his apologies for pushing the Chinese and knocking over the table. After that, he was released. (8th, Reuters)

### International Women's Suffrage Alliance Holds Annual Meeting in Copenhagen, Song Meiling Sends Telegram to Express Regards, Asking for Assistance in China's War of Resistance

(Chongqing) The International Women's Suffrage Alliance will hold its 13th annual meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, from the 8th to the 14th of this month. At the invitation of the alliance, Madame Chiang sent a telegram on behalf of Chinese women, saying, "Chinese women respectfully extend their congratulations to your esteemed alliance. We understand the significance of your alliance more profoundly than anyone else. For thousands of years, Chinese women have been confined to their homes, not asking about foreign affairs. Seven years ago, the National Government first implemented the policy of equality between men and women, giving women all civil rights and interests. Today, this government is leading 450 million people to resist Japanese aggression and struggle arduously in order to obtain national freedom and lay the permanent foundation for world peace, justice, and equality between men and women. In order to achieve the universal realization of women's rights and interests, we firmly request your alliance to assist our brave and sacrificing Chinese compatriots and female compatriots in particular, so as to establish a free new China. Only then can women in East Asia continue to cooperate with women around the world to jointly seek cultural progress." Chiang Song Meiling. (8th)

### Manchester Guardian Discusses Sino-Japanese War

(London) The Manchester Guardian, in its discussion today of the beginning of the third year of the Sino-Japanese War, stated that Japanese politicians and military personnel have now gained the lesson that battlefield victory is one thing, and victory in the overall war is another. Japan seems to have had some success in solving military problems, but has completely failed in solving the diplomatic and administrative problems that followed. Japan now has no other better policy than to make all situations reach the terrible extent to which the Chinese may be forced to seek peace at any cost. However, judging from news from all sides, the Chinese fighting spirit and discipline are improving daily, and their political unity is unprecedented. As for the Chinese guerrillas, the arguments in the Pacific Affairs magazine can be cited for reference. It said that one thing that Japan, which has expanded too much, must fear is that the long-term support of the guerrillas will allow a newly organized and trained regular army to be established behind its lines. If so, the sun will "set". In addition, there is a contradictory phenomenon in the Sino-Japanese War, that is, although the Japanese have won victories on various fronts, they are now anxiously eager to end the war, while the Chinese, although they have lost almost everything, are now actively preparing to continue the war. The Chinese calmly wait for the opportunity, retreat into the interior, and are confident that final victory will ultimately belong to China. (8th, Reuters)

### Britain and France Implement New Policies, Relying on Military Force as a Diplomatic Backing, The Two Countries Negotiate a New Sky Agreement, Allowing Military Aircraft to Practice Crossing Borders

(London) According to news today, Britain and France are currently negotiating the conclusion of a new air force agreement, allowing British bombers to be allowed to conduct long-distance flight exercises in French airspace. The agreement intends to give the British Air Force the opportunity to prepare for war against Germany. At the same time, a well-trained squadron of the British Air Force is preparing to fly to Belgium to visit friendly countries, and then plans to continue flying to other countries. The purpose is to announce to the world that the British army is ready to take action. Military sources say that the authorities have considered a plan for mutual visits between the British and Polish Air Forces. This plan has not been officially confirmed, but according to the new policy of Britain and France, using strength and expanding military effectiveness as diplomatic backing, the plan will soon be implemented.

(London) The official figures for the strength of the British Air Force have not been released, but according to informed sources, the British Air Force now has more than 6,000 high-speed fighter planes and more than 12,000 bombers. In addition, the Ministry of Aviation is actively training air force pilots and plans to fly in the airspace of other countries for practice. It has now requested the French government to allow British aircraft to conduct non-stop flights in southern and southwestern France, and wants to give the same convenience to the French Air Force. Aviation experts claim that once this method is implemented, the training received by British Air Force pilots will be the same as in wartime, and Britain and France can demonstrate a realistic cooperative situation. At the same time, the quality of British aircraft and the strength of the Air Force can be clearly known to all countries. (7th, Havas News Agency)

### Situation in Danzig Somewhat Eased, Germany Continues to Have Intentions in Slovakia, Building Military Roads Connecting to the Two Provinces of Pomorze, Army Holds Large-Scale Exercises in the Center

(Paris) Observers here recently declared that although the Danzig issue is temporarily calm, Germany may take action against Slovakia. Given that the German authorities have decided to complete the repair of all military roads in Bohemia and Moravia immediately, the German army is holding large-scale exercises in the center, and other departments also seem to be making military preparations, the concerns are not unfounded. As for the city of Danzig, the situation has eased, and it may not change in some time. This can be seen from the fact that German leader Hitler has gone to his Berchtesgaden villa to rest, and Polish President Mościcki has also left the capital to spend his summer vacation. Generally speaking, after the British and French authorities issued a firm statement, if the Danzig issue is attempted to be resolved by violence, it will be difficult to make it a local incident. In addition, German wheat is ripe and about to begin harvesting. During this busy farming season, it is not appropriate to launch a large-scale offensive. All these points are well-known to the German authorities. (7th, Havas News Agency)

### British Education Minister Warns Germany

The British city of Derby. The Education Minister, Lord De La Warr, gave a speech here this afternoon, warning Germany, roughly saying, "If aggression occurs again, Britain will definitely resist it. In recent months, British public opinion has abandoned the spirit of complacency and has a determination to resist. The whole people, although unanimously hoping for peace, are determined to resist any attempt at aggression and control. If a European war breaks out over the issue of the Free City of Danzig, it is because the German government knows deeply that an independent Poland is an obstacle to its plan to control all of Europe, and the maintenance of the status quo of the Free City of Danzig is related to the independence of Poland, so it wants to first occupy the Free City of Danzig and then strive to control all of Europe. That's all. If the two countries want to reach a compromise, they must be sincere with each other. If one party goes back on its word at any time and place, it will be difficult for any compromise to be reached. Based on this, we must fulfill our commitments to all countries that are guaranteed by our country, firmly cooperate with them, and clearly declare that any aggressive country, no matter how cunning the means of aggression used, will definitely be resisted. We have the ability and the preparation to do so. If there is anyone who proposes a compromise to us, it must be genuinely sincere in seeking peace and able to lay a lasting peace, which is what we are happy to hear." (8th, Havas News Agency)

### Chamberlain to Deliver Important Declaration Tomorrow, Not Allowing Violent Change to Danzig

(London) Regarding the issue of the Free City of Danzig, Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a declaration to the House of Commons on the 10th of this month. It is reported that he will review the various proposals that Germany made to Poland in March of this year, and the reasons for Poland's rejection, and state that the Danzig issue is of great importance, thereby restating the position adopted by Britain. (8th, Havas News Agency)

(London) According to informed sources, although the situation in the Free City of Danzig has eased somewhat, Prime Minister Chamberlain still intends to deliver an important declaration to the House of Commons on Monday (the 10th), informing domestic public opinion that if the status quo of the Free City of Danzig is attempted to be changed by violence, Britain will have to intervene. The German and Polish sides have conducted negotiations, but have achieved nothing, and the blame lies entirely with the German side. Regarding this matter, Poland is reported to have fully agreed. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck has also telegraphed Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying that the British government not only consulted the Polish government on the content of the declaration and sought its agreement, but also maintained close contact with the Polish government on whether it was appropriate to issue this declaration, which is deeply appreciated. Political figures here commented on the situation in the Free City of Danzig, saying that the door to negotiations is still wide open for abolishing the city's current system and replacing it with a system acceptable to both Poland and Germany.

### Free City of Danzig Engaged in Military Preparations, Building Fortifications Along the Baltic Coast, Poland Has Determination to Defend its Territory, Military Supplies Transported Busily in the Eastern Triangle

Warsaw. According to news received here, the authorities of the Free City of Danzig are currently continuing to conduct military preparations, and the various measures taken are as follows: (1) Building defensive fortifications along the Baltic coast of the city, and installing eight light machine guns in civilian houses near the Schichau wharf; (2) Many German ships have recently docked at the Schichau wharf, bringing in large quantities of machine guns and small cannons, which have been distributed to various barracks; (3) A special military committee has been established in Danzig to select young people to join the recently organized volunteer army; (4) Polish customs inspectors are prohibited from entering the city's airfield, and Polish workers serving at the Schichau wharf have been dismissed. In addition, according to the "Warsaw Courier," the fortifications on the Bischofsberg heights in Danzig have been completed, and defenses are being built along the coast in the Geglau area. (7th, Havas News Agency)

Warsaw. According to today's "Warsaw Daily," coastal fortifications are being built between Danzig, Schwinemünde, and Glettkau. It is reported that these fortifications are defense works other than the artillery positions on Bischofsberg Mountain on the outskirts of Danzig, and the barbed wire and trenches laid on the Polish-Danzig border. Fifteen Czech workers employed in the fortifications in East Prussia attempted to flee into Polish territory and were arrested by the Danzig police. Currently, members of the National Socialist Party are still angrily denying that they have transported weapons into Danzig, and believe that rumors that military preparations have been made on Bischofsberg Mountain and elsewhere are ridiculous. It is said that the construction on Bischofsberg Mountain is a children's sports field. There are no new developments in Danzig. National Socialist newspapers report that Poland may be conducting a plan, including economic sanctions, but there is no news from the Polish side to substantiate this claim. (8th, Reuters)

(Paris) Poland has begun to transport food, oil, and military supplies to the eastern "triangle area." This action is being implemented on the advice of the French military. It is reported that Poland is determined to defend the triangle area of eastern Poland at any cost. (8th, Associated Press)

### French Government Encourages Childbirth, Newlywed Couples Who Have Four Children in a Row Can Receive a Huge Sum of 20,000 Francs

(Paris) According to today's newspaper, in order to encourage population growth, the French government stipulates that each newlywed couple can borrow public funds of 20,000 francs, with an annual interest rate of two percent. If the couple has a baby in the future, 3,000 francs of the loan can be reduced. If they have a second and third baby, 5,000 francs can be reduced for each child. If they have a fourth baby, the remaining 7,000 francs do not need to be repaid either. In other words, after each couple has four children, the borrowed public funds of 20,000 francs will be completely canceled. (8th, Haitong News Agency)

### German Government Orders Mobilization of All Levels of Able-bodied Men, Deadline for Registration and Physical Examination, Army Can Increase to One Hundred Divisions

(Berlin) The government authorities recently posted notices in the streets, stating that all men born in 1918-19-20, all those born in 1914-15-16-17 who have not yet enlisted for some reason, and all those born in 1906-07-10-13 who have not undergone a physical examination for some reason, must report to the examination committees everywhere between the 7th of this month and the 9th of September to undergo a physical examination for enlistment. (8th, Havas News Agency)

(Berlin) The government authorities' recently decided conscription measures have been commented on by all official parties, roughly saying that this matter has no special significance. Since the restoration of the conscription system in March 1935, Germany has begun to reorganize the army, and now it continues to do so, conscripting new recruits who have not yet enlisted. Among them, each of the 1918-19 classes has about 300,000 to 350,000 recruits, and the 1920 class has at least 400,000. According to the total number of German army personnel, there are 53 divisions. Once all the new recruits have enlisted, they will increase to more than 100 divisions. The National Socialist Stormtroopers, the Protection Squadron, the Labor Service Corps, and the police are not included. The German government's intention to step up the conscription of new recruits is to calmly cope with all incidents. This is what the German government authorities have repeatedly stated.

### British Consul-General Stationed in Vienna Withdrawn

(Berlin) According to information obtained here, after the German government requested Britain to withdraw its Consul-General stationed in Vienna, the Consul-General has already left Germany and returned to his country last night. (8th, Haitong News Agency)

(Berlin) German semi-official sources recently issued comments stating that the reason for Germany's request for Britain to withdraw its Consul-General stationed in Vienna, Gardner, is due to Britain's recent deployment of spy networks in Germany and the installation of intelligence personnel in its diplomatic missions. British diplomatic representatives, such as Consuls-General and Consuls, have special training in gathering intelligence. Germany finds it difficult to tolerate this kind of fact.

### Axis Powers' Military Strategy Attempts to Control the Mediterranean, Italian Newspaper Praises Greatly Increased Strength, Ciano Goes to Spain to Persuade Usage

Milan. The Italian "Popolo d'Italia" published an article today, commenting on the current political and military situation in Europe, declaring that the military position of Germany and Italy today is much stronger than it was at the time of the Munich Conference. Germany's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and Italy's annexation of Albania have greatly strengthened their strength. If a war breaks out, the central Mediterranean will be completely under the control of the Italian navy and air force, and the Western powers' sea routes from west to east in the Mediterranean will be cut off by the Axis powers. (8th, Haitong News Agency)

(Paris) The Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to take a warship from the port of Naples today to Spain, and is expected to arrive at the port of Barcelona on the 10th of this month. (8th, Havas News Agency)

(Rome) Rumors that the purpose of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Spain is to win Spain over to join the Axis military alliance have been denied by the "Italian News", which says that the task of Foreign Minister Ciano's trip is to contact General Franco and exchange views on Italian-Spanish cooperation. Italy has no intention of interfering in Spanish policy, but Italy and Spain have the same interests in the Mediterranean, so Italy and Spain should strive for common ideals.

Minority Issues Resolved Amicably by Germany and Italy

(Rome) Regarding the dispute over minority issues between Germany and Italy, the two governments have established an amicable solution. This issue arose after the Upper Adige region of former Austria (namely the two regions of Tyrol and Trentino) was ceded to Italy in 1919. Now that it has been resolved, Germans in the region are now allowed to return to their homeland. Any losses incurred due to abandoning land will be compensated by the Italian government, but this does not mean that 200,000 Germans in the region will be moved to Germany en masse.

### Mutual Assistance Agreement Issue: Three Nations Continue Negotiations, British and French Representatives Meet Molotov Again, Presenting New Proposals and Urging a Quick Response

(Moscow) The French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Naggiar; the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds; and the Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, Strang, are scheduled to visit the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, at 6:00 PM today to continue negotiations on the mutual assistance agreement issue. It is rumored that the Soviet Union intends to request that Britain and France also provide guarantees regarding changes in the political systems of the Baltic states. Strang denied this, calling it absurd. (Havas, 8th)

(Paris) According to official sources, the new instructions of the British and French governments to their representatives in Moscow constitute the final proposals of the two major democracies to the Soviet Union. It is reported that Britain and France have requested a prompt response from Moscow. (Associated Press, 8th)

(London) Last night, the British government admitted that although discussions on Soviet participation in the Anglo-French front in Europe have been ongoing for thirteen weeks, a final agreement has not yet been reached. The latest instructions from the British and French governments remain strictly confidential and will not be disclosed before the Soviet Union is informed. Regarding the suggestion that the Soviet Union should assist Britain and France in defending the Netherlands and Switzerland, Britain and France will not insist that the Soviet Union accept it. On the other hand, Britain and France also hope that the Soviet Union will abandon its demand that the Anglo-French-Turkish-Polish mutual assistance agreement be included. If so, the only difficulty lies in the Soviet Union's demand that the tripartite alliance include "indirect aggression." If this issue is also resolved, the tripartite agreement can certainly be concluded. The main articles of the agreement are as follows: (1) If any of the three countries is attacked, the three countries will assist each other. (2) If any of the three countries assists a guaranteed country, the three countries must assist each other. (Associated Press, 8th) (Paris) Although the new proposals of Britain and France have been delivered to Moscow, there is considerable doubt here as to whether the Soviet Union will accept them. "Le Journal" and "L'Oeuvre" reported the contents of the Anglo-French proposals as follows: (1) Britain and France agree to place the Netherlands and Switzerland outside the scope of the guarantee, but on the condition that the Soviet Union abandon the mutual assistance pact with Turkey and Poland. (2) The guarantees of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to the Baltic states are divided into two types: (A) If the Baltic states are directly attacked, the three countries will automatically take military action. (B) If domestic events in the Baltic states cause the Soviet Union to feel threatened, the three countries must first consult before taking military action. According to the two newspapers, if the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is not satisfied with the above proposals, the three countries, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, may temporarily sign only a tripartite mutual assistance agreement and postpone the guarantee issue.

### Soviet-Egyptian Relations: Soviet Union Insists on Restoring Relations First Before Negotiating Trade

Cairo The Egyptian Minister of Finance announced yesterday that negotiations with the Soviet Union to restore trade relations have broken down because the Soviet Union demanded that Egypt first diplomatically recognize the Soviet Union before engaging in negotiations. The British government had urged Egypt to accept the Soviet demand, but Egyptian officials and gentry, due to the different political systems and ideologies of the two countries, refused to agree to establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Although Egyptian officials hold this opposing view, the government is currently considering establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, hoping that the negotiations between the Egyptian Ambassador to Britain and the Soviet Embassy in Britain will continue.

### German Business Representatives Go to Moscow in a Private Capacity to Promote Trade Relations

(Moscow) According to foreign sources, two German business representatives have arrived in Moscow by plane from the capital of Latvia to conduct trade negotiations with the Soviet authorities. This rumor was denied by the German Embassy, ​​which stated that it is true that German business people came to the Soviet Union in a private capacity. It is said that this caused the rumor. On the British side, it is said that if the tripartite mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can be concluded, it will create good conditions for the development of Anglo-Soviet trade relations.

### Germany and Bulgaria Strengthen Relations; Discussions between Representatives Focus on Economic Issues

(Berlin) Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov visited here on the 4th of this month and held talks with the German authorities. An official communique was subsequently released, stating briefly, "The talks were very friendly and fully in line with the traditional and natural friendship between Bulgaria, Germany, and Italy." Political figures here stated that the discussions between the German and Bulgarian representatives focused on economic issues, and an agreement may be concluded soon. However, foreign observers stated that the discussions between the German and Bulgarian representatives did not achieve any positive or significant results, as evidenced by the vague comments from the German side. (Havas, 7th)

(Berlin) The official visit of Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov to Germany has ended. According to a communique issued here last night, it stated that Bulgaria is an element of maintaining order in southeastern Europe and mentioned the natural and traditional friendship between Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria, saying that it hopes to deepen political, economic, and cultural relations between them. It is heard that the talks between the Bulgarian Prime Minister and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop were mostly about economic matters, but the issues of Dobruja and Macedonia were also discussed in detail. Bulgaria has not yet formally made demands regarding the above two regions, so people here believe that this issue has not yet reached an urgent stage. Although all sectors in Germany claim to sympathize with Bulgaria's demands, it seems unlikely that there will be any concrete expression in the near future. (Reuters, 8th)

Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria Regarding Prime Minister Koseivanov's visit to Germany, the "Zora" newspaper here has issued a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that German political figures are fully aware of Bulgaria's position and will do their utmost to assist Bulgaria in overcoming all difficulties. The German side, in view of the amicable relations between the two countries, has not requested Bulgaria to accept any restrictions or conclude any new agreements. (Havas, 8th)

### Dutch Queen Personally Handles Cabinet Crisis, Inquiring of Military Leaders, Showing Concern for the Far East

The Hague According to well-informed sources here, the Queen of the Netherlands is personally mediating the cabinet crisis. Given the tension in the international situation, and in order to protect the country's major interests, she hopes that the cabinet difficulties will be resolved as soon as possible. Yesterday, the Queen summoned the speakers of both houses of parliament, the former Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Fock, and the chiefs of staff of both the army and navy to the palace. The presence of these military leaders has led to a general belief that the Netherlands' military position in the Far East is closely related to the new cabinet. General opinion is that former Prime Minister Colijn can overcome the difficulties and form a new cabinet. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

The Hague Since the cabinet crisis in the Netherlands occurred, a new cabinet has not yet been formed. Former Prime Minister Colijn has denied rumors that he has given up forming a new cabinet. Yesterday, the Queen met with the speakers of both houses of parliament and the president of the Council of State for discussions. Political figures here believe that the Queen will again urge Colijn to form a new cabinet. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

### Syrian President Resigns, Dissatisfied with French Policy

Damascus, the capital of the Syrian Republic The President of the Syrian Republic, al-Atassi, resigned today. His letter of resignation stated briefly, "After I signed a treaty with France on behalf of this country in September 1936 (stipulating that Syria would become independent three years after the implementation of this treaty, but the French Parliament rejected the ratification last year), I was trusted by the National Assembly and took on the difficult task. Successive cabinets have also believed that this treaty would enable this country to obtain its due position. However, our efforts have not been successful, and the policies pursued by the mandatory power (i.e., France) are contrary to the Franco-Syrian treaty. I have no choice but to resign to thank the people of the country." (Havas, 8th)

### Prominent Figure in French Financial Circles, Mr. Tannery, Passes Away

(Paris) A prominent figure in French financial circles, Mr. Tannery, who served as the Governor of the Bank of France in 1935, has passed away. Tannery's appointment as Governor of the Bank of France was widely regarded as the first step in reorganizing the management of the bank to make it more subject to government control. The Popular Front was dissatisfied with Tannery's appointment, believing that he was too closely associated with the old regime. He was succeeded by Labeyrie in 1936. (Reuters, 8th)

### Imperial Japanese Edict Enforces Compulsory Labor, Invoking National Mobilization Law, Millions Will Be Conscripted

(Tokyo) An imperial edict was promulgated this morning, invoking Article 4 of the National Mobilization Law, to be implemented from July 15. The article stipulates compulsory labor for businesses necessary for national mobilization. It is estimated that approximately ten million people will be conscripted. The full text of the article is as follows: "When it is found necessary to implement national mobilization in wartime, the Japanese government may, in accordance with the provisions of the imperial edict, conscript the people of the Empire and order them to engage in businesses of national mobilization. Persons mobilized under government control in accordance with this article will be paid the same wages as they received before being conscripted." (Reuters, 8th)

### US Senate Opposition Blocks New Neutrality Act, 34 Senators Issue Declaration, Government Faction and Opposition Are Equally Matched

(Washington) Thirty-four senators, led by Republican Senators Johnson and Nye, have signed a declaration opposing the revision of the current Neutrality Act. It stated, "We firmly oppose the repeal or modification of the current Neutrality Act, which prohibits the sale or export of arms and various military supplies to belligerent countries. At the same time, we cannot agree to grant the executive branch the power to designate aggressor nations among the belligerent countries for the sake of expediency. We believe that after war breaks out in the future, the United States should maintain a position of genuine neutrality. This belief must be maintained to the end by all glorious and proper means." The last sentence probably refers to using delaying tactics to obstruct the establishment of the new Neutrality Act. (Havas, 7th).

(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to study the Neutrality Act amendment issue on the 11th of this month. The discussion will focus on Chairman Pittman's proposal, the main point of which is that the "cash and carry" provision should apply to all arms and other goods. Pittman recently stated that after the Foreign Relations Committee meets five or six times, it can draft a report and submit it to the Senate for discussion around the 20th of this month. Political observers believe that after the Neutrality Act proposed by Bloom, which was approved by the House of Representatives with the Volstead Amendment (maintaining the arms embargo during wartime), both the government faction and the opposition faction have decided to adhere to their original positions. Therefore, there will inevitably be a fierce debate in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. After the report is submitted to the Senate in the future, the intensity of the discussion can also be predicted. As it stands now, the government and the opposition factions are equally matched, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. The opposition senators in the Senate will inevitably use delaying tactics to obstruct the establishment of the new Neutrality Act. However, according to government sources, the core members of the isolationist faction, such as Republican Senators Borah and Johnson, are older and will hardly be able to speak eloquently for hours at a time in this hot summer season. Younger people like Nye will have more difficulty extending the speech time, so it is unlikely that delaying tactics will achieve any success. (Havas, 7th)

(Washington) Senator Johnson, representing San Francisco, claimed that 34 senators have recently signed a declaration, stating that they will fight any change to the existing Neutrality Act with all the glorious and legitimate means at their disposal. It is said that this declaration is a threat to prolong the debate on the government's neutrality proposal. Some senators said they recognized this as an open threat to those who procrastinate. The US government was not greatly disturbed by Senator Johnson's actions. Government officials said that Johnson's influence was not as great as usual. Although the government acknowledged that there would be a long and fierce debate on the Neutrality Act, it now increasingly believes that President Roosevelt will ultimately achieve his goal.

### New York Mayor Visits Chinese Antiquities Exhibition, Delivers Speech Attacking Aggressor Nations

(New York) The Mayor of New York City, LaGuardia, accompanied by the Chinese Consul General in New York, Yu Tsune-chi, visited the Chinese Antiquities Exhibition today and delivered a speech, urging the citizens of this city to assist China in resisting Japanese aggression in various ways, saying, "This war against human rights should not be allowed to continue."

All proceeds will be allocated to the relief fund for the orphans of Chinese soldiers, which was initiated by Madame Soong Mei-ling, the wife of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang.

### US Senate Reviews Bill to Stop Purchasing Foreign Silver; Discussions in Finance Committee Unproductive; Treasury Department Lowers Purchase Price of Foreign Silver

(Washington) Senator Townsend, a Republican from Delaware, introduced a bill in January of this year to suspend the purchase of foreign silver. The main points can be divided into four: (1) Authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to sell the existing 1,700,000,000 ounces of silver at prices he deems favorable to the government. (2) Minting currency with 500,000,000 ounces of silver. (3) Allocating $250,000 for US industrial expansion of silver uses. (4) All imports of foreign silver should be prohibited. This case has been submitted to the Senate Finance Subcommittee for discussion, but no agreement has been reached. Discussions will continue next week, and Secretary of State Hull has been invited to attend and express his views. Political figures believe that Secretary of State Hull will certainly comply. It is said that there are many senators who oppose the purchase of foreign silver, and they even threaten to introduce a bill demanding a complete ban on it. Therefore, clarification of this issue still requires effort. Observers claim that when the Townsend bill is submitted to the Senate for discussion, opposition senators may jointly mention the general issue of relations between the United States and Mexico. This is because Mexico has benefited the most from the US silver purchase policy, and the negotiations regarding the expropriation of US-owned oil mines in that country have been protracted, and the attitude of President Cárdenas of that country is extremely lacking in sincerity. Most senators are therefore extremely dissatisfied and may use this as an excuse to prohibit the Treasury Department from continuing to purchase foreign silver. (Havas, 7th)

(Washington) The Senate Currency Committee met yesterday to discuss the plan to stop buying foreign silver, but it was fruitless and the meeting was adjourned. According to Republican Senators Townsend and Taft, a bill prohibiting the purchase of foreign silver is bound to be passed. According to US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, before obtaining a more detailed report on the world silver situation, the US Treasury Department will use a "daily" standard for purchasing silver. Morgenthau continued that the recent sharp decline in world silver prices was unexpected. The State Department has now notified the Canadian government that the US has resumed its agreement to purchase 1.2 million ounces of silver from Canada. Yesterday, more than 2 million ounces of silver were shipped from Mexico to New York. (Associated Press, 8th)

(Washington) The Treasury Department continued to lower the purchase price of foreign silver yesterday to 36.75 cents per ounce. This price remained the same today. (Havas, 7th)

(London) People in the London silver market originally expected that the United States would adjust silver prices to match those in London. Now that they hear that the US Treasury Department has decided to buy foreign silver at a price of 36.75 cents per ounce, they are all happy, believing that they are far-sighted. Although London's silver market is strong in the long term, it is possible for the United States to raise the purchase price. However, the US official price will not fluctuate with the market price in London on a daily basis. The current price level, unless there are other developments, is unlikely to change significantly in the near future. However, the US decision to redistribute the silver purchase procedure has psychologically benefited the London silver market. At the same time, many people in the silver market believe that India will take advantage of the current low silver prices to continue purchasing, so that the profits earned from recent gold sales can be used for investment.

### High Commissioner Echols Wants to Get Rid of Party Affiliation, Unwilling to Compete with Roosevelt as a Democrat

### Führer Hitler Appoints New Aide-de-Camp, Filling Vacancy Left by Weidemann

(Berlin) Captain Weidemann, aide-de-camp to Führer Hitler, has been vacant since he was appointed Consul General in San Francisco in the spring. Recently, Hitler announced the appointment of Captain Albrecht as his successor. Albrecht is 35 years old and joined the Navy in 1922. From 1934 to 1936, he served as a naval officer on a torpedo boat. Last summer, he was transferred to Hitler's naval deputy adjutant, and recently he was transferred to Führer's aide-de-camp and captain of the Nazi motorcade. Hitler has a total of four aides-de-camp. In addition to Albrecht, there are also Stormtrooper Brownshirt Captain Brueckner, Stormtrooper Blackshirt Captain Schaub, and Head of the Personal Chancellery Bormann. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

### Spanish Socialist Leader Under Indictment, Military Tribunal Considers Death Penalty

Madrid Pascual, a former important figure in the Spanish Republican government and leader of the Socialist Party, who served as Speaker of the House of Representatives and Chairman of the Defense Committee, handed over the city of Madrid to the National Army in March of this year and was arrested afterward. The military court has now tried him. The most important charges listed in the indictment are the following two: (1) Pascual is responsible for the development of the Socialist Party. (2) Pascual is also responsible for the national strike in 1917. (3) When King George VI of England held his coronation ceremony in 1937, Pascual represented the Republican government to congratulate him and held talks with important figures in British political circles. The prosecutor indicted in court, saying that the defendant's crime should be punished with the death penalty. However, some believe that Pascual is old and frail and may be acquitted and released. Others said that Pascual was one of the leaders of the former Republican government and should be severely punished. (Havas, 8th)

### Invading Japanese Troops in Guangdong Focus on Raiding the Upper Reaches of the Dongjiang River; Japanese Troops from Various Units Gather in Dongjiang and Chaoshan Areas; Chinese Troops in the Beijiang Area Are Taking Advantage of the Situation to Advance Southward Step by Step

Hong Kong Correspondence: After withdrawing from Chao'an, the Chinese army is concentrating in the Quxi-Jinshi area in the western suburbs of Chaozhou, preparing for a counterattack. At the same time, fresh reinforcements are also heading to the front lines from certain key locations to intercept the enemy. Above Jieyang, the mountains overlap and the paths are narrow, making it difficult for Japanese artillery and cavalry to exert their power. Therefore, from Jieyang to Tangkeng-Shekeng, and further northwest to Xingning, and due north to Meixian, all are dominated by towering mountains, creating a situation where "one man guards the pass, and ten thousand cannot pass." Even the Japanese air force cannot find targets to bomb. Therefore, it is clearly not easy for the Japanese army to attempt to raid the Guangdong-Jiangxi border via this route. In the future, the advance will be made via three routes: one is to concentrate forces near the suburbs of Guangzhou to scout Boluo, Heyuan, Laolong, and Longchuan, and raid Xingning. Simultaneously, they will advance from Miaoyang to attack Tangkeng and Shekeng to flank the east of Xingning. Another route is to scout Dabu and Meixian from Chao'an to shake the north of Xingning. The dispatch of the South China Expeditionary Army of the Japanese army, led by Ando, to Chaoshan seems to be to command the Jieyang front, using that area as the main force. On the other hand, they are transferring Japanese troops from Xijiang, Beijiang, Qiongyai, and Jiangmen to gather in Shilong and Taiping of the Dongjiang River, as well as Humen, aiming to break into Boluo and Heyuan from the south bank of the Dongjiang River, realizing their treacherous plan to attack Xingning from the north. Therefore, it has been reported recently that the Japanese army in the Shilong area has increased to more than 2,000 men. It is also rumored that a Japanese aircraft carrier stationed on Weizhou Island in Hainan has secretly sailed to Pinghai Harbor in Huiyang, accompanied by armed ships. At night, patrol ships use searchlights to illuminate the shore. On the sea off Haifeng, on the 25th, Japanese warships were spotted shelling the shore to test the strength of the Chinese army. Even Xingning, Laolong, Meixian, Heyuan, and other places have been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft. This is indeed a prelude to the Japanese army's restless movements on land. At present, the Chinese local forces on the south bank of the Dongjiang River are on strict alert. At the same time, the various divisions of the XXX Corps of the regular army are taking advantage of the transfer of Japanese troops in the Beijiang area, leaving the defenses empty, to advance southward step by step, hoping to take Guangzhou in one fell swoop. Recently, the Chinese army on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway broke through the Japanese camp in Xinjie, directly pressing on the various areas of Shangpanyu. Plainclothes teams have been spotted in the Xiaogang area near the city, greatly alarming the Guangzhou H army. All the city's patrol teams have been withdrawn to garrison in the suburbs. As a result, foreigners in Shamian are even spreading rumors that the Japanese army in Guangzhou is preparing to withdraw. The defensive works of the Japanese army in Shaqi and other places have been removed. However, the Japanese army does not seem to intend to completely abandon Guangzhou at present. However, it is a fact that some Japanese agencies in the city have been relocated. The Japanese army headquarters originally located at the Osaka warehouse on Fenghuanggang in Henan, Guangzhou, suddenly moved to Huangpu on the 25th. All military supplies and special operations battalion soldiers were transported to Huangpu via the new city road by transport vehicles. It is also rumored that the Japanese army originally stationed in Sanshui Southwest in Xijiang has also withdrawn to Guangzhou and will be transferred to Chaoshan. The propaganda personnel under their protection have also withdrawn with the main force. Looking at the withdrawal of defenses from Guangzhou and the Northwest Jiang by the Japanese army and their reinforcement of Chaoshan, the depletion of their forces can be seen.

### Qingdao Residents Forced to Participate in Anti-British Rally; White Russians in Qingdao Also Forced to Participate; Many Japanese Do Not Agree with Anti-British Sentiment

Late news from the North China Daily News reports that on the afternoon of June 23, around 3 o'clock, personnel from the Qingdao Municipal Health Bureau, protected by Japanese guards, plastered anti-British posters on the walls of the British Consulate General, British commercial firms, and public buildings. Later that day, they also distributed leaflets throughout the city. At 11 o'clock in the morning, a mass rally was held in the Third Park, led by the principal of a certain Chinese school under Japanese protection. Japanese textile mills also suspended work for a period of time that day, allowing Chinese workers from the mills to participate in the rally. Attendees were paid 30 cents per adult and 5 cents per student. In addition, Chinese stores were ordered to send one representative each, with those who disobeyed facing a fine. Many Chinese people dressed as Japanese were present to monitor whether Chinese people obeyed the order. Representatives from the White Russian Anti-Communist League were also ordered to attend. About 40 or 50 White Russians were present, displaying shame and reluctance. They were threatened with expulsion from the country, so the White Russians reluctantly agreed to participate. A local English newspaper criticized the rally, saying, "The spontaneous feelings of the people have been demonstrated by the procession that departed from the Third Park." This statement from the editor seems to be satirical, as there is ample evidence indicating that apart from the Japanese, Chinese people either participated under coercion or were paid to do so. After the rally, a procession was formed, marching through the main streets to the municipal government building and the British Consulate General, shouting "Down with Britain" before ending. Among the Japanese themselves, there was indeed evidence of disagreement with this action. Japanese staff from Mitsui & Co. were seen standing outside the office all day, tearing down anti-British posters as soon as they were pasted on the walls. Yokohama Specie Bank refused to allow posters to be pasted on its walls. Many smaller Japanese shopkeepers also took similar actions until they were ordered not to tear down the posters. Rear Admiral Murray of the British warship HMS Cornwell paid a courtesy visit to a certain Japanese admiral on June 22. The latter returned the visit to the British Consulate General at 10 a.m. on June 23. When the Japanese admiral arrived at the consulate general, seeing the posters pasted on the building and other surrounding buildings, he expressed to the British Consul General and Rear Admiral Murray that he did not approve of the means taken by the Japanese military authorities that day and apologized to them. Not long after the Japanese admiral left the consulate, a team of Japanese marines arrived to protect the British Consulate. The British authorities did not request Japanese protection, but the Japanese admiral had guaranteed before leaving the consulate that no disrespectful incidents would occur. These Japanese guards, carrying rifles with bayonets fixed, prevented the procession from getting too close to the British Consulate General building. The day passed peacefully. British nationals in this situation remained calm. White Russian employees in British commercial firms were ordered to resign from their positions in British stores. However, as they rely on these firms for their livelihood, they ignored the order. It is expected that they will continue to face pressure. Chinese employees in British commercial firms also fear that they will be forced to quit.

### Showing Sympathy for China's Resistance Against Japan: Head of Indian Ambulance Team Passes Through Hong Kong, Returns Home to Report on Work

Hong Kong Correspondence: Indian people are extremely sympathetic to China's resistance against Japan and are concerned about the wounded soldiers and civilians in the Chinese interior. Therefore, in mid-September of last year, under the guidance of Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress, an ambulance team was dispatched, bringing 50 boxes of medical equipment and two ambulances, departing from Bombay, via Singapore to Hong Kong, and then transferred from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, to be directed by the Chinese authorities to serve on the front lines and provide relief to wounded and sick Chinese soldiers and civilians. Now, Dr. Caorjia, the deputy leader of the team, because he has been in China for more than half a year, needs to return home to report on his work, so he came to Hong Kong from Chongqing on the 29th of last month, waiting for a ship to India. Now, Dr. Caorjia has provided a detailed account of the team's work and recent situation, as follows:

According to Dr. Caorjia, they came to China last autumn to serve, and after arriving in Guangzhou, they went north to work in Hankou. At that time, the battle of the Yangtze River was quite intense, so they treated wounded soldiers day and night, with almost no rest. Later, when Wuhan was in danger, they were ordered to move to Yichang to continue their work. After Wuhan fell, Yichang was frequently bombed by Japanese planes. Although they raised the Red Cross flag and the flag of the Indian National Congress, they were not spared. They had no choice but to retreat to Chongqing. In the spring of this year, knowing that medical supplies were particularly scarce in the Northwest, they left Chongqing again to work in the Eighth Route Army. Until now, all the team members, under the leadership of the team leader, continue to work hard, traveling thousands of miles for the sake of sympathizing with China's resistance against Japan, and working hard in or near the war zone. Dr. Caorjia said that they feel very happy because their purpose in coming to China, in addition to saving lives and healing the wounded, and doing their duty as human beings, is mainly to express the Indian people's deep sympathy for China's resistance against Japan, and their willingness to do their best to support China in fighting against the aggressors on a common front, and to work for the national liberation of both China and India. After arriving in the interior, they were not only loved and welcomed by the Chinese people, but also helped each other in everything, as close as brothers and sisters. They also felt that the good customs of the Chinese people were admirable.

Since the start of the second phase of the war of resistance, the Chinese army's resistance has obviously increased, and the Japanese army's offensive has in fact reached the point of exhaustion. As for the medical equipment in the army, it is also becoming increasingly complete, but there is still a shortage of many medicines, especially in the Northwest. There are many wounded soldiers and sick people, but medicines cannot be supplied in a steady stream due to transportation issues. In addition, items such as clothing and books are also in great need. Therefore, in addition to reporting on the work situation, he will also raise some medicines and money in India to bring back for use, etc.

### Guilin Provincial Assembly Recommends Maintaining Guangxi's Mining Industry; Advocates Correcting All Past Restrictions; Proposal Passed and Sent to Provincial Government for Implementation

Guilin Correspondence: The Guangxi Provincial Provisional Assembly recently held its opening session, lasting a total of 14 days, with an extension of 4 days to discuss special review cases. The most important of these special review cases was the issue of mining affairs. Before the outbreak of the war of resistance, Guangxi's mining industry was quite developed. Manganese mines and iron mines were found everywhere. As for the tin mines in He County, Fuchuan, Hechi, and Nandan, and the antimony mines in Binyang and Qianjiang, there were no fewer than a hundred mining areas. About 130 large and small companies were engaged in mining. Furthermore, the tungsten mines in Teng County and the gold mines in Mengjiang, Shanglin, Cangwu, and Fengyi were also flourishing. The Guangxi provincial treasury has always relied on this as a major source of income. After the assembly opened, the assembly members all believed that the regulations on mining and transportation formulated by the Department of Construction in the past were too restrictive, and most operators in the mining industry found them inconvenient. Since the Sino-Japanese War began, various mineral products related to military use have been subject to strict export restrictions. Although the authorities have established offices to control trade, the restrictions on foreign exchange and the low prices have caused huge losses to various mining companies and merchants. Some have even suspended operations or gone bankrupt due to losses. Coupled with traffic congestion and transportation difficulties, various mining industries have plummeted. The assembly members, representing the will of the people of the province, used this gathering to extend the session by four days specifically for the discussion of mining affairs. The main points were: (1) Request the government to approve 50% of foreign exchange in order to purchase industrial supplies and hardware to facilitate mining in various mining areas. (2) Request the government to raise prices and purchase mineral products, or set fair prices according to the fluctuations of the current market value. (3) Request the government to grant long-term exemptions from mining taxes, transportation taxes, and road fees. (4) Request the government to organize a mining industry review committee to mediate all temporary disputes related to mining affairs. (5) Request the opening of mining areas in Pingnan, Guiping, and Wuxuan to assist production. (6) Request the elimination of various overlapping taxes on mineral products to ease the burden on merchants. (7) Request the government to purchase more coal and charcoal machines and rent them to mining merchants to avoid mining stoppages due to oil shortages. The above seven items are all for the sake of the future of the mining industry in the province. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, overseas Chinese and domestic wealthy merchants believed that the Guangxi authorities were committed to the construction of new enterprises and once opened up various mining affairs throughout the province, attracting shareholders and wealthy merchants from home and abroad to invest in mining in Guangxi. Therefore, several years ago, merchants who invested in mining in Guangxi sprung up like mushrooms, and those who engaged in this industry, such as tin mining, manganese mining, and tungsten mining, all made great profits at one time. Later, the Guangxi provincial government issued regulations restricting the mining industry due to the issue of tax increases. Later, because mining was seen as a source of great profit, powerful military and political figures began to compete with the people for profits, often using military and political power to seize superior mining areas. After that, there was control of mining trade, restricting free transportation and export, with the government setting up special offices to purchase mineral sands, engaging in exclusive operation and transportation. At this point, the mining industry declined. The provincial assembly recently put forward the above proposals, wanting to maintain Guangxi's mining industry, but this is only a stopgap measure. A fundamental remedy still requires thorough reform by the government. The proposals have now been passed by the assembly and sent to the provincial government for separate handling. The mining industry in Guangxi may have a glimmer of hope for relief.

### Wuxi Bomb Explosion: Shanghai-Nanjing Train Narrowly Escapes Disaster; Train Arrived Only Seconds Before Explosion; Guerrillas Active Along Railway Line; Japanese General Offensive Against Pudong Fails

The English-language "China Press" reports that the Shanghai-Nanjing express train operated by the "Central China Railway Company" under Japanese control arrived in Wuxi yesterday (July 7). Seconds after the engine passed over the spot where a bomb was buried, the bomb exploded. The train was almost destroyed. The driver and fireman, alert, immediately braked to a stop, averting a major disaster. Although the engine escaped the full force of the explosion, part of it was damaged. No casualties were reported. The engine and tracks were heavily damaged, disrupting rail traffic. Japanese soldiers immediately rushed to the scene, dispatching troops to search for guerrillas on both sides of the railway. This special action was clearly the work of guerrillas. Another group of Japanese soldiers led passengers in groups on foot to a nearby station, where they waited for a train from Suzhou to take them down to Shanghai. Passengers were all inspected at the station and subjected to strict questioning. The damaged site is currently under repair. Although Shanghai-Nanjing rail traffic is still running, passengers must change trains at the explosion site. The Japanese authorities in these areas have recently tightened regulations on the movement of Chinese civilians. Travelers are subject to inspection and questioning and must present passes issued by the Japanese Special Service Department. Military passes issued by other parts of the Japanese army and navy are not recognized. According to news received here today, fierce fighting is taking place near Yixing. Guerrillas in that area and the surrounding area have been increasingly active recently. The business of a certain Japanese transportation company headquartered in Shanghai is now limited to Suzhou. Business beyond any location past Suzhou has been suspended.

The Whole Story of the Japanese Army's General Offensive Against Pudong

At the beginning of the month, about 2,000 Japanese troops, puppet troops, and puppet police launched a general offensive against Pudong, with Datuan as the target. This matter stemmed from the defection of 100 puppet police officers in Nanqiao, who engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The defecting troops then joined Tao Sheng's forces. Tao's garrison was centered on Datuan, and Datuan was also the center of the Pudong guerrillas. The Japanese army then mobilized heavy troops in an attempt to "thoroughly suppress" them. Japanese planes first dropped seven or eight bombs on Nanhui City, attempting to send troops to occupy it, and then advanced westward to Datuan. At Chaitangwan, they were fiercely attacked by the guerrillas under Gu Lifeng. After the Japanese army suffered a defeat, they seemed to have abandoned the attack on Datuan. The main force gradually withdrew to Pubin, and the various ports along the Pu River, such as Zhanggang and Tangkou, were blockaded.

Fierce Fighting in Luhui

At 9 a.m. on the 2nd, more than 800 Japanese troops advanced towards Luhui Town by land and water. One route advanced towards Hangtou, and the other left Luhui Town and advanced towards the guerrilla headquarters. A unit of the motorcycle patrol also advanced to the right side of the original headquarters, firing inside with strong firepower. After about a quarter of an hour, no return fire was seen. They entered to search, but there was nothing suspicious. They then knew that the headquarters had been moved elsewhere and returned in disappointment. Before they had gone half a mile, they were suddenly ambushed by a squad of guards. At that time, the fierce battle began. Machine gunners suddenly opened fire on the Japanese army, and more than 20 Japanese soldiers fell in response. The Japanese army began to retreat, and the guerrillas immediately pursued.

Japanese Bombardment

When the Japanese army reached a village and prepared to counterattack, they encountered the First Battalion again. The intensity of the battle was the fiercest since the start of the war of resistance. At that time, more than 400 Japanese troops from Hangtou used artillery and other large quantities of sharp weapons, making a desperate attempt. When the Japanese army reached Jingyangzhi Bridge, they saw a flower factory that had been incinerated by incendiary bombs.

Chinese Victory Report

It is reported that in this battle, the Japanese army lost one officer and more than 50 soldiers, and more than 100 were wounded. The guerrillas captured six sets of uniforms, two Japanese flags, eight steel helmets, one telescope, one small steel cannon, five light and heavy machine guns, 17 rifles, and six boxes of ammunition. Unable to vent their anger, the Japanese army sent planes the next day to drop incendiary bombs. Almost the entire town of Luhui was turned to ashes. Details are still to come from Datuan, Xinchang, and Luhui.

### Concessions Cancel Emergency Alert, Traffic Restored

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council implemented an emergency alert for one day the day before yesterday. The situation went very well. This alert was cancelled as of 0:30 yesterday morning (8th). All obstacles at the road intersections bordering the two concessions and at the bridges across the Suzhou Creek were also removed or placed on the side of the road before 5 a.m. yesterday morning to allow vehicles and pedestrians to pass. The English-owned Tram Company's Nos. 5, 6, and 7 streetcars and No. 18 trolleybuses all started to run directly to the North Railway Station at the border road yesterday morning. The junctions of the Chinese and the Shanghai Western concessions, such as Daxilu, Hongqiao, and Tushanwan, have also been opened. Flights from Shanghai to the guerrilla areas have also resumed yesterday, such as those to Fengjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Songjiang. The shops and entertainment venues along Avenue Edward VII have also resumed normal business. However, all public group meetings will still be postponed until after the 10th in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Council.

### Christian Groups Self-Renewal Movement, Establishing a Covenant of Reformation, Correcting Bad Habits

Since the outbreak of the war, due to changes in the environment, the general public has become accustomed to extravagance and decadence. The Shanghai Christian Student Organizations Association has launched a self-renewal movement for this purpose, establishing a covenant of reformation, asking student circles in various provinces and cities to respond and implement it in order to save the situation. A few points are listed below:

Practice frugality, thrift, and service. Those with money contribute money, and those without money contribute effort. (1) I establish and strictly implement a personal budget system and develop the habit of keeping daily accounts. (2) I do not make new clothes. When it is necessary to make them, I do not make expensive or luxurious ones. (3) I do not have the idea of disliking the old and liking the new for daily necessities. (4) I (female students) use less cosmetics. I do not wear silk stockings or perm my hair. (5) I do not use fancy envelopes and stationery to write letters. (6) I reduce eating snacks. (7) When there are empty seats on third-class trams, I do not necessarily have to ride in first class. (8) I take fewer photos when touring parks with friends. (9) I do not often hold dinner parties. When I do, I can implement the practice of everyone paying for their own meal. (10) I reduce spending during holidays. (11) I practice frugality in life and save money every month to donate to the country and those who are suffering. (12) I do my best to serve the student fellowship or social charity and educational work. (13) I help with family affairs and homework, and do my own things as much as possible without having to bother others. (14) I will pay attention to the lives of the masses (rickshaw pullers, workers, police officers, newspaper boys, etc.), find more opportunities to approach, understand, and help them.

Reject bad habits and entertainment. Proper entertainment is the vitamin of life. (1) I use hobbies such as sports, music, chess, calligraphy, painting, and writing, as well as group life, to replace improper entertainment. (2) I reduce the number of times I watch movies (once a week, only watching valuable films, or possibly not watching movies). (3) I do not go to unconscious or low-level entertainment venues (including dance halls, etc.).

### Japanese Naval Attaché Points Out Concessions Authorities' Hope for Cooperation Between Concessions and Organizations; States the Court Issue is Most Unpleasant

Continental Daily reports that Japanese Naval Attaché Vice Admiral Nomura, at a press conference yesterday (the 7th), issued lengthy remarks concerning the two-year "undeclared war" in China and the status of the Shanghai International Settlement. He urged officials in the International Settlement to recognize the "City Government" as the de facto authority in the area. Nomura declared, "We want the International Settlement authorities to recognize the Nanjing 'Reformed Government' and the Shanghai 'City Government.' We observe a tendency among the International Settlement authorities and others to firmly ignore these new Chinese administrative organs. If this continues, cooperation between the International Settlement and the Chinese administrative organs will be quite difficult. This is a matter of acknowledging existing facts, rather than blindly claiming such organs do not exist."

Japanese Side Recognizes Puppet Organization as the De Facto Authority

When asked if he acknowledged the "Reformed Government and City Government" as Japanese organs, Nomura replied that this was the result of a Japanese policy for Chinese to manage Chinese affairs. However, Nomura clarified, "The Japanese government does not recognize the 'Reformed Government and City Government,' but Japanese army and navy leaders recognize them as de facto authorities. When a new 'Chinese Government' is established, the Japanese government will grant recognition. What the Japanese side wants is for the International Settlement authorities to work together with this 'government,' without necessarily recognizing it in a legal sense."

Most Unpleasant Regarding Chinese Courts in Both Concessions

Nomura recounted that the Chinese courts in the International Settlement are "organs of the Chiang regime," handling cases related to Japan or Japanese people under Chiang's orders. This is something the Japanese military cannot tolerate. The jurisdiction of the courts should be transferred to the Japanese side. The International Settlement authorities have refused to approve the transfer and have instead voiced support for the courts. The Japanese side expresses sincere gratitude for the Municipal Council's efforts to suppress terrorism in the International Settlement, but the courts, at the very least, remain the most unpleasant phenomenon."

Goes So Far as to Call the South Bank of the Suzhou Creek a Hostile Zone

Efforts to restore the normal state of the International Settlement have been underway for some time. Various obstacles to cooperation between the Japanese side and other authorities have also been removed. Therefore, it is hoped that normality will be restored soon. However, if the south bank of the Suzhou Creek continues to be maintained as a hostile zone, and the authorities on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek continue to lack cooperation with the Japanese side, it will be quite difficult to unconditionally restore normality to the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. If one of the two areas does not improve, the other area cannot improve either.

Every Household in Japan Experiences Suffering

Nomura then discussed the issue of the "undeclared war," saying that the idea of acting "as if things are normal because war has not been declared" is one of the reasons why the situation cannot improve. For example, Japan has dispatched over a million soldiers to fight. The dead and wounded number in the thousands. Throughout Japan, every household is feeling the impact of the war. To say that the situation is normal because war has not been declared is absurd."

War Prolonged, Both Countries Exhausted, Eagerly Await End

When asked whether declaring war was merely a formality, he replied that Japan was acting in self-defense, fighting against the Chiang regime and not against the Chinese people, which is why war had not been declared. When asked how long he believed the war would last, Nomura replied that the war was exhausting not only the belligerent nations but everyone else as well, and therefore it was hoped that it would end soon. However, this would depend on other countries involved in the war.

### Discount on Drafts is Illegitimate Trading; All Banks and Money Shops Resolved Not to Engage; Four Banks Will No Longer Maintain Discount Rate Hereafter

Regarding the issue of the discount on drafts, the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed instructions to strictly prohibit it. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association both advocated that all businesses in the same trade should uniformly and strictly restrict the handling of requests from depositors for the payment of drafts, as this is the only way to eliminate abuses. Therefore, regardless of fixed-term or current account deposits, only company branches with genuine commercial needs will be allowed to pay for drafts through the same industry; no leniency will be shown to private individuals or firms. With such a narrow scope, it is hoped that the financial situation can be maintained in a normal state, and the trend of discounting will not become increasingly severe. Now that the new draft system has been implemented, drafts can be remitted to the interior to purchase local goods and are already used in the same way as cash. There should no longer be any discounting. In order to prevent the discounting of draft notes in speculative foreign exchange transactions, reporters from the New Voice Agency learned yesterday from the Banking Association, Money Shop Association, and Currency Exchange Association that all member banks and shops of the three associations have resolved not to engage in this illegitimate business of discounting drafts. At the same time, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China have resolved not to maintain this discount rate hereafter and hope that non-member small money shops, silver companies, and firms will not engage in this illegitimate business, which would fuel speculation, violate government financial policy, and cause unrest in the financial industry. This matter concerns the vital interests of the industry and is inconsistent with the original purpose of drafts.

### Currency Exchange Industry Exhibition of Fake and Obsolete Banknotes; Scheduled to Open Tomorrow; Location is Qingyuan Lane

The Currency Exchange Industry Fellowship Association plans to hold an exhibition of Chinese and foreign fake and obsolete banknotes. They have collected no less than two hundred types of fake and obsolete banknotes. In addition to fake and obsolete banknotes from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, there will also be fake and obsolete banknotes from Citibank, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Philippine pesos, French francs, and other countries. There will also be banknotes from the Great Qing Bank, the first paper money issued by the Chinese Central Government, and military banknotes from the warlord civil wars, all with dates recorded. The opening is scheduled for the 10th of this month at 50 Qingyuan Lane, on the third floor of the association's clubhouse. It is reported that the association is providing admission tickets free of charge for the interest of its members.

### Restriction on Withdrawal Method; Legally Effective; Judicial Yuan Notifies All Levels of Courts

In order to stabilize the Shanghai financial market, the Ministry of Finance used a telegram to stipulate the method of restricting withdrawals. The Shanghai silver and money industries were ordered to comply. Now, it is heard that the Ministry of Finance believes that this new restriction method must have legal effect and has specially submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Judicial Yuan for notification to all levels of courts in Shanghai. The Executive Yuan approved the request and immediately notified the Judicial Yuan for further notification.

### Draft Preparation Inspection Committee to be Established; First Inspection Scheduled for Late July; Draft Certificates Will be Issued When Needed

Since the Shanghai Banking Association allowed banks and shops to obtain inter-industry drafts on July 4, these draft notes have been circulating in the market. Draft certificates will be issued when needed. The Draft Preparation Inspection Committee will be established soon, with the first inspection scheduled for the end of July. Details are as follows:

Committee Members Presumed

The total amount of inter-industry drafts obtained by various banks and shops from the Bank Preparation Association is 50 million yuan in national currency, which is already circulating in the market. Various industries have found it convenient. Regarding the establishment of the Draft Preparation Inspection Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has nominated Xu Jiqing, the Bankers' Association has nominated Qin Runqing, the Foreign Bankers' Association has nominated He Bosi Gen, and the Banking Association has internally decided on Wu Yunzhai. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China will jointly nominate one representative. Once the representatives of all groups have been nominated, the committee will be established immediately. The first draft preparation inspection is scheduled for the end of July. At that time, the number of drafts obtained and the types and amounts of collateral will be announced separately.

Draft Certificate will be issued if needed

Regarding the issuance of draft certificates, reporters from the New Voice Agency learned from the Bank Preparation Association yesterday that the implementation of obtaining inter-industry drafts has been quite effective. There have been no difficulties in the exchange of inter-industry drafts. Since the original purpose of issuing draft certificates was to facilitate the exchange of inter-industry drafts, it is believed that there is currently no need to issue draft certificates again. However, a draft of the simplified rules for issuing draft certificates has been prepared. If issuance is needed in the future, the draft rules will be submitted to the Standing Committee for approval and implementation. The draft rules stipulate that the face value of draft certificates will be divided into four denominations: 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan.

Evaluation Committee Members to be Separately Hired

The Bank Preparation Committee has separately hired Chinese and foreign experts from the industry's factories, real estate companies, China Business Company, New Feng Foreign Firm, Anli Foreign Firm, and Mager Foreign Firm to evaluate the value of the property provided by various banks and shops when obtaining inter-industry drafts. It will also be divided into (1) Real Estate Share, (2) Securities and Stock Share, and (3) Goods Share. Each share will have a chairman, who will also be a member of the committee, and several members, who will be assigned by various companies. If the market price of goods whose value has been evaluated falls, collateral may be reclaimed at any time.

### Implementation Difficult in Lost Areas; No Foreign Exchange for Prohibited Goods; No Transshipment to Non-Lost Areas via Mail; Paper Industry Requests Accommodation for Goods Stopped Midway

After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the measures prohibiting imported goods, the Inspectorate General of Customs has ordered customs offices in various regions to implement them. Currently, except for customs offices in the lost areas, where implementation is difficult due to special circumstances, all other customs offices have implemented the measures since the date of arrival of the order. However, foreign exchange is not provided for prohibited goods, and transshipment is not allowed. Details are as follows:

No Foreign Exchange Given to Prohibited Goods

Prohibited imported goods include luxury goods, semi-luxury goods, and non-essential goods, totaling 18 groups and 234 tariff items, such as foreign wine, white sugar, canned food, meat dishes, fruits, vegetables, wine, beer, spirits, drinking water, tobacco, as well as toys, silk fabrics, wool and cotton fabrics, wood, paper, bamboo, wood, rattan ware, and stone products. Currently, customs offices in non-lost areas have strictly implemented the measures, while implementation is difficult in lost areas due to a lack of authority. However, the Chinese government does not provide statutory foreign exchange for these prohibited goods, and they can only be purchased on the black market. At the same time, transshipment is absolutely prohibited.

Prohibition of Import and Transshipment via Postal Packages

Goods prohibited in non-lost areas, whether imported by postal package from overseas, imported by postal package from domestic ports, or transshipped by postal package from domestic ports, are all prohibited. However, if it is for the purpose of regulating market prices in the rear, supplying special uses, or there are other legitimate reasons, and it is approved by a government agency, the Ministry of Finance may review the actual needs and issue a purchase and transport permit. After the implementation of the above prohibition measures, the adverse trend of international balance of payments can be reversed, the overall trade deficit can be gradually reduced, and the Japanese plan to massively dump goods in China and obtain foreign exchange can no longer be implemented.

Paper Industry Requests for Accommodation

The Shanghai paper industry has stated that some types of paper are also included in the list of prohibited imported goods announced by the Ministry of Finance. However, before the announcement of the measures, the industry had a large amount of paper in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which was being transported to Haiphong and then transshipped to Kunming. Due to transportation difficulties in Haiphong, some goods have been piled up there for three to four months, and some for eight to nine months. If some of the goods are on the prohibited list, the customs office will not allow import when they arrive in Kunming, resulting in a great loss. The industry has sent a letter to the Inspectorate General of Customs asking if the customs office has any supplementary measures for the above situation, such as issuing a visa to allow goods stopped midway to be handled separately.

Essential Items Supplied as Much as Possible

Regarding the import of essential goods, the New Voice Agency learned from the banking sector yesterday that after the Ministry of Finance approved the supply of statutory foreign exchange, the Foreign Exchange Review Committee has been established in Chongqing. If various industries want to apply for foreign exchange, they must apply to the committee in Chongqing in accordance with the regulations of the ministry. It is reported that the place of transport is limited to non-lost areas, and a balancing fee for the difference between the legal price and the posted prices of the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications must be paid. As for the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai, the British-owned Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation will temporarily maintain it, but there will be restrictions on swaps to prevent manipulation by speculators.

### French National Day Celebration Program Same as Last Year with Grand Military Exercises

Continental Daily reports that the French Concession is preparing to celebrate the 150th anniversary of French National Day on July 14th. Hundreds of coolies are already at work. Avenue Joffre's French police station and the Public Works Department Building have been decorated with flagpoles and lanterns. Due to the current situation in China, the French authorities did not hold the usual large-scale celebration last year, and this year's celebration will be the same. However, this only applies to the public celebration. The French community and their friends will still hold banquets and receptions. The celebration program will be the same as in previous years. First, a flag-raising ceremony will be held at the French Consulate General on Friday morning. In the morning, there will be grand military exercises in the French Park. Troops from the French police station and the local French garrison will participate. Formal receptions will be held at the French Consulate General, the French General Assembly, and the French Billiards Association, with the one at the French Billiards Association being the grandest and most lively. In the evening, the usual dance party will be held at the association.

### Swedish Ship Xinanli Ordered to Return by Japanese Warship; More Than Ten Passengers and Comprador Detained in Daishan; Warship Orders Ship to Stop and Return to Shanghai

The Swedish company Ruifeng Foreign Firm's ship Xinanli departed from Shanghai for Dinghai and Daishan on the 6th of this month. However, when it arrived in Daishan on the 7th, the comprador Mr. Dong and 16 passengers were detained, and the ship was forced to return to Shanghai. Dozens of passengers from Dinghai returned to Shanghai on the same ship and are negotiating with the company for refunds. Details are as follows:

Passengers on Xinanli Detained

After Japanese troops landed and occupied Daishan, Shenjiamen, Dinghai, and other islands in the Zhoushan archipelago, all foreign ships operating on the Shanghai-Dinghai-Ningbo-Dinghai route, such as the Hana, Gaodeng, and Tianbao, suspended their services. In this situation of complete traffic disruption, a Swedish company called Ruifeng Foreign Firm rented a ship called Anli Marler from Marler Company, renamed it Xinanli, and operated on the Shanghai-Dinghai route, also stopping at Daishan. It is reported that they had reached an agreement with the Japanese side in advance and had a guarantee from the head of the Daishan puppet "Maintenance Association," Huang Bohe. The ship set sail from Shanghai for the first time on the 6th of this month and arrived at Dongshajiao in Daishan on the 7th, where it dropped anchor and stopped. At that time, 13 passengers from Daishan boarded a barge to land, but they were detained by the Japanese troops in Daishan. The ship then sent comprador Mr. Dong and translators to explain, but they were also detained (it is said that they have been released). Meanwhile, a Japanese warship sent troops to board and search the ship, forcing it to leave and not remain there.

Prevented from Docking in Dinghai, Forced to Return

At that time, the person in charge of the ship also went to visit the puppet "Maintenance Association Head" Huang Bohe to request assistance, but Mr. Huang was not in Daishan and was said to have gone to Dinghai on "official business." Therefore, the ship immediately set sail for Dinghai. However, when it was approaching the Dinghai port, it was suddenly stopped by a Japanese warship, ordered to stop, and thoroughly inspected. After the inspection, it was instructed to return to Shanghai immediately, and all passengers were refused permission to land. The ship had no choice but to return on the same ship and arrived in Shanghai at about 10:00 AM yesterday, mooring at a pontoon in the Huangpu River. Dozens of passengers from Dinghai were all aggrieved and complained, negotiating with the company for refunds. According to reporters from Daguan News Agency, it is not yet decided whether the ship will sail again in the future.

### British Consul General Goes to Weihaiwei for Summer Vacation; Belgian Ambassador to China Also Leaves

The English-language North China Daily News reports that British Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Phillips, and his daughter left Shanghai on the Shuntian wheel steamer this morning (the 8th) for a vacation in Weihaiwei and are scheduled to return to Shanghai on August 2nd. During Mr. Phillips' absence, Mr. Kittson will take charge of the consulate general's affairs. The English-language North China Daily News reports that Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. Gyu Mu, and his wife left Shanghai by boat yesterday (the 7th) for North China and are expected to return to Shanghai in September.

### Refugee Relief Association Assists with Relief

Since its establishment in November of last year, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has donated funds to assist various charitable organizations. Currently, the number of refugees supported by the association through various charitable organizations is as follows: Cilian Association (Renji Hall) 18,482 people, Shanghai Relief Branch 11,148 people, Shanghai International Relief Committee 6,194 people, Zhen, Dan, Jin, Yang Five County Native Place Association 310 people, Sacred Heart Academy 154 people, Baoshan Native Place Association 118 people, Shanghai First Special District City Joint Relief Committee 95 people, China Children's Welfare Association 614 people, Refugee Children's Middle School 122 people, and the association's First Shelter 7,904 people (currently entrusted to the Salvation Army for management), the association's Second Shelter 927 people (this shelter has more than 3,000 self-sufficient refugees, who are only provided with accommodation but not food).

### Second Batch of American Wheat Shipped; Warm Enthusiasm from All Sectors in America Unceasing; Quantity Similar to Last Time, Still Unloaded in Shanghai; Allocated Entirely for Refugee Relief According to Previous Methods

The American wheat donated to Chinese refugees, the first batch of 24,000 bags of crushed wheat, weighing 3,360,000 pounds, was transported to Shanghai on January 9th of this year by the transport ship Sa Hu Kela. It was allocated by the Shanghai Advisory Committee of the American China War Relief Association according to urgency. Now, it is learned that the second batch of American wheat has also been shipped to China, with the quantity roughly equal to the last time. It will still be unloaded in Shanghai and handed over to the Shanghai Advisory Committee of the China War Relief Association for allocation. Like the first batch of American wheat, in addition to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and the Nanshi refugee area receiving it for relief, severely affected areas in the interior will also be allocated. In addition, American commercial organizations and charities have also donated condensed milk, milk powder, canned food, and medical supplies, which are being shipped to China together, demonstrating the warm sympathy of the American people for the suffering Chinese refugees.

### Chaotic Situation in Tonghai; War Has Not Stopped; Japanese Troops Attack Chinese Army Positions at San Chang; Chinese Battalion Resists and Fights Four Times

According to shipping industry sources, after repeated failed attempts to invade Haimen, Japanese troops launched an attack on Haimen in a joint land and sea attack on the morning of the 6th. The Chinese troops stationed there were prepared and counterattacked separately, launching a fierce battle. The war has not stopped to date.

Japanese Troops From San Chang Jointly Invade East

The war between the Soviet and Japanese troops in Tonghai and other places in northern Jiangsu has not stopped to date. On the 5th, a Japanese army unit of more than 200 people, carrying sharp new weapons, led by puppet police and puppet self-defense forces, advanced in three routes with four armored vehicles and two tanks along the Tonghai Highway, and joined more than 60 Japanese troops stationed in San Chang to attack eastward, attacking the Chinese army positions at Tangjia Town, Yulong Bridge, Gujiayuan, and other places from the side. Japanese warships fired from outside the port of Xingang, and the roaring artillery fire was endless.

Chinese Battalion Charges and Engages in Hand-to-Hand Combat

The Chinese army stationed there, only a battalion of a certain regiment of a certain column, although outnumbered, all officers and soldiers in the battalion were exceptionally brave. Under the command of the battalion commander, they went out of the trenches for bayonet warfare, charging several times, falling one after another. The position was lost and regained four times. As the fortifications had been destroyed by Japanese artillery fire and there was a risk of being surrounded, they retreated to the four villages of Koukou Town to reorganize and replenish their strength.

Adverse Situation, Japanese Troops Retreat

The Japanese troops suffered heavy losses in this battle. A large team of puppet self-defense forces, carrying many weapons, scattered and fled during the battle. The Japanese puppet troops, seeing the adverse situation, retreated to San Chang on the night of the 6th. Currently, fierce battles are taking place in the area of Xisan Yuzhen. The situation is chaotic.

### Fewer Japanese Warships in the East China Sea; Coastline Bombed Again; Strict Precaution in Qianjiang

According to shipping industry sources, the number of Japanese warships in the East China Sea has decreased recently, but seven or eight Japanese warships are still anchored off the coast of Wenzhou, Yueqing, and Yuhuan, and three Japanese warships are in the waters of Dinghai. Apart from occasionally bombing various coastal areas, there have been no changes. Therefore, the situation in various parts of eastern Zhejiang is still peaceful.

Japanese Aircraft Bomb

The shipping industry has learned that on the 7th, twelve Japanese bombers dropped bombs in batches on the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, including Zhenhai and Cixi. Details of the losses are unclear. Three Japanese warships were anchored off the port of Liqu, Zhenhai on the morning of the 7th, but there have been no unusual movements.

Qianjiang Precautions

In Qianjiang, although Japanese warships have frequently passed by in recent days, there has been no movement. Currently, five Japanese warships are anchored in Hangzhou Bay. The Chinese army is taking strict precautions on the south bank of the Qiantang River.

### Grain Merchants Continue to Order Saigon Rice; Totaling 600 Tons, Now Shipped; Rice Prices Fall Back; Source Increases

The Shanghai food problem, previously due to manipulation, caused prices to soar, breaking the 24 yuan mark, causing public anxiety. Small-scale commoners suffered terribly. During this time of scarcity between harvests, although domestic reserves have decreased and rice exports are banned, the source has been affected. Fortunately, Shanghai rice has been purchased and hoarded in large quantities, and reserves are

Extremely Abundant

It is estimated that there are still about six to seven hundred thousand bags, enough to supply the city for three months, so the overall food situation is not a cause for concern. Moreover, the authorities in the settlement and the rice industry groups have set price limits for the highest grade of white rice and the middle and lower grades of rice. The New Voice Agency learned yesterday from Daffu Foreign Firm that a large amount of foreign rice had previously been purchased, but due to the tightening of foreign exchange, the price doubled, causing a telegram to be sent back to withdraw the order. Now, a small number of food merchants in Shanghai have again entrusted Daffu Foreign Firm to order some Saigon rice for shipment to Shanghai for regulation. It has now been completed.

Number One Saigon

600 tons of foreign rice, about 6,000 bags (large bags), is priced similarly to the Shanghai rice price limit, about 21 yuan per bag. The shipping has commenced from Saigon and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of July. The source of domestic rice has recently increased, with five or six boats arriving by river and three or four thousand bags by land and water, totaling about 10,000 bags. Recently, the summer season has arrived, the market sentiment has stabilized, hoarders have stopped, and the market price has fallen back. A total of more than 3,000 bags were traded in the market this morning.

### Lihe Moufu Wheel Steamed to Ningbo Yesterday; Transshipped Into Port Outside Zhenhai Kou; Deping Wheel Did Not Open to Ningbo Yesterday

Lihe Foreign Firm's shipping department's Moufu wheel steamed to Zhenhai at four o'clock yesterday morning. Deping wheel did not set out. The details are given as follows:

Moufu Sails to Ningbo

Moufu wheel, with 200 passengers, and passengers and goods, steamed to Ningbo from Shanghai at four o'clock yesterday morning. It is expected to arrive at the Qilizhen sea surface outside the Zhenhai estuary at more than three o'clock in the afternoon of the same day. Starting at five o'clock in the evening, a rented Ningbo inland river vessel, Yongan wheel, dragged a barge and sailed out of the exit. In the estuary, transhipping the passengers and goods into the port, and then at the Zhenhai terminal, it was dragged to Yong by a deeper draft wheel, Jingsheng wheel, from Yong. The same ship loaded with Shanghai local products to Shanghai.

Transshipment Situation

The Ningbo defense department has approved the export of the old, weak, women, and children, and issued passes, which is more convenient than the time of war, so the wheel will bring a large number of passengers when it comes to Shanghai this time. Considering that the wheel has difficulty taking care of the luggage of passengers, they have booked a joint transport method for luggage, whether from Shanghai to Ningbo, or from Ningbo to Shanghai, the wheel is responsible, and the mother does not need to take care of it herself. The De Ping wheel did not steam to Ningbo yesterday, because it is still in the application for approval, and it is scheduled to sail on the 11th.

### Sharp Increase in Exports of Native Products Reaches Post-War Record; Tung Oil, Tea, and Hog Bristles Under Unified Control for Marketing; Significant Increase in Export Volume After Barter Trade Agreements

In order to promote the export of native products and increase foreign exchange reserves, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated measures for settling foreign exchange for export goods and receiving exchange rate differences. It has also designated tung oil, tea, hog bristles, and minerals as four categories to be purchased and marketed under the unified control of the Trade Commission. This is because agreements have been made with the Soviet Union, the United States, and others for barter trade or designated as collateral for debt repayment. The following is a record of the export amounts from January to May:

Tung Oil

Quantity: 198,603 metric tons, valued at 18,094,038 national currency, equivalent to 7,552,876 customs gold units. Of this, 182,048 metric tons were destined for Hong Kong, valued at 17,062,436 national currency. These shipments of tung oil were transported to Hong Kong via the new South China transportation routes for centralized export, with the largest amount being shipped to the United States. The selling price of tung oil for export in Hong Kong is approximately HK$90 per picul.

Tea

Quantity: 81,573 metric tons, valued at 6,032,815 national currency, equivalent to 2,516,152 customs gold units. Of this, 45,386 metric tons were destined for Hong Kong, valued at 3,563,093 national currency. The Trade Commission has stipulated that exports be centralized through Hong Kong. This year's production in various regions is higher than in previous years. Tea farmers are currently busy roasting new tea, and it is expected that there will be a large number of exports after May.

Hog Bristles

Quantity: 12,325 metric tons, valued at 12,539,194 national currency, equivalent to 5,230,748 customs gold units. Of this, 3,373 metric tons were shipped to Hong Kong, valued at 2,534,802 national currency; 3,847 metric tons to the United States, valued at 6,036,449 national currency; 1,909 metric tons to the United Kingdom, valued at 1,972,400 national currency; and 2,365 metric tons to Germany, valued at 1,377,686 national currency.

Minerals

Total value: 39,054,507 national currency, equivalent to 16,296,991 customs gold units. Of this, shipments to Hong Kong were valued at 19,481,104 national currency, and shipments to Annam were valued at 12,230,156 national currency. Mineral sands are important raw materials for military needs. In recent years, due to the increasingly tense global situation, various countries have been actively preparing for war and have been purchasing mineral sand raw materials from China, with Germany being the largest buyer. After the war, China has actively developed its mineral resources, leading to a sharp increase in production.

Other

In addition to tung oil, hog bristles, tea, and minerals, the government has specifically permitted merchants to freely export other native products. In addition to exempting taxes and duties, providing insurance against war risks, facilitating transportation, and easing financial constraints, designated agencies are also making every effort to purchase these products to increase exports. At the same time, permission is granted to receive the exchange rate difference. Therefore, the export of native products is bound to increase sharply as a result. In May, the total value reached 83,784,000 national currency, setting a post-war record. Regarding transportation issues, the government is now seeking new routes.

### Luen Cheong Labor Strike Reaches Stalemate; Absurd Demand for "Strike Expenses" of 500,000; "Saboteurs" Should Bear Full Responsibility - No Problem Between Workers and Factory

According to the Continental Press, it was learned from reliable sources yesterday (July 7th) that the labor dispute at the British-owned Luen Cheong factory in Pudong has not yet been resolved reasonably. Only the Luen Cheong Company and the workers can immediately resolve their disagreements. However, "saboteurs" are hindering the ongoing negotiations between the company and the strikers. In fact, the company has agreed to all the conditions proposed by the workers, except for one. Currently, negotiations have reached a stalemate. The prominent point of contention that the company has so far refused is the "request" to give the workers 500,000 yuan for "expenses incurred during the strike." Company personnel find this "request" quite ridiculous and say it is incomprehensible how the strikers could have spent such a large sum of money. Furthermore, the company has clearly stated its position: it refuses to "subsidize" a strike instigated by agitators. Another condition requested by the workers is a 12% wage increase, to which the company has actually agreed. The company has already proposed a plan to increase the workers' wages by 19% per month. The other two conditions requested by the workers were already implemented even before the strike.

These two conditions are: (1) Employees are entitled to one week of leave after marriage; (2) Pregnant female workers are entitled to one month of leave before childbirth. According to the report, the informant criticized the strike, saying that a small number of workers at the Luen Cheong Printing Factory demanded a wage increase and went on strike in early May. This partial strike escalated into a general strike on June 10th, ten days after Ding Geller was attacked and subsequently died. At the same time, a strike also broke out at the Luen Cheong Textile Factory on May 20th, apparently instigated by "saboteurs" in Pudong.

This strike, along with the agitators' intention to start a general strike in the textile factory, directly led to the attack on Ding Geller. Both the textile factory and the printing factory have been closed since June 10th. When reporters inquired about whether it was true that workers were mistreated by Russian guards employed by Luen Cheong Company, the informant replied that this was an unfounded accusation. The accusation may have arisen because workers living in Puxi often competed to board the company-provided sampans to cross the river, leading to disputes with the guards at the riverside. The guards, in order to prevent accidents caused by the sampans, often have to ensure that the sampans are not overloaded, which is a safety measure and cannot be regarded as mistreatment of workers. It is claimed that workers who do not cooperate with the agitators are not allowed to return to work, and the company has suffered huge losses since closing the two factories. The Luen Cheong Printing Factory was established in 1927 and is equipped with the latest equipment. In 1934, the Luen Cheong Textile Factory was also established in Pudong, with 44,000 spindles and 1,130 looms, capable of producing 680,000 yards of fabric per week. This strike involves a total of 3,000 workers, including 2,300 workers from the textile factory and 700 workers from the printing factory. The former mostly consists of female workers, while the latter mostly consists of male workers.

### Design Promotion of Small-Scale Industries

The National Government's Ministries of Economy, Education, and Interior are jointly promoting the design of small-scale industries to increase production capacity. The Committee for Promoting the Design of Small-Scale Industries has been organized and is now actively working on related design matters, including: (1) Defining the procedures for promoting small-scale industries; (2) Allocating locations for the widespread establishment of small factories; (3) Implementing basic vocational education in different regions; (4) Introducing and training talent for small-scale industries; (5) Providing incentives, subsidies, loans, and assistance for small-scale industries; (6) Designing and supplying equipment for small-scale industries, whether using completely manual, semi-manual, semi-mechanical, or mainly mechanical methods. The committee believes that small-scale industries are most needed in the inland provinces today and occupy a major position in wartime industry. It constantly seeks the opinions of experts and strives to assist in promotion.

### Charity Tea Dance Party Changes Organization, Adds Committees to Strengthen Forces, and Prepares for Reopening

The Charity Tea Dance Competition organized by the Dance Hall Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association was announced to be open from July 1st. In order to enrich its ranks and expand its forces, the association, after gathering and discussing with various responsible persons, decided to make slight changes to its internal organization. Therefore, it is announced that the event will be temporarily suspended from July 7th. It is now planning to establish a Sponsorship Committee, inviting leaders from all walks of life to serve as committee members; (2) the Venue Affairs Committee will invite dance hall managers and dance troupe leaders to serve as committee members, and will be responsible for arranging red star rotating dances; (3) the Entertainment Committee will invite film industry personnel to serve as committee members, and will be responsible for the entertainment activities of the conference to increase enjoyment; (4) the Publicity Committee will invite editors and reporters from major and minor newspapers to serve as committee members, and will be responsible for all publicity matters of the conference. It is reported that the above-mentioned measures are currently being negotiated and implemented separately. Once the arrangements are properly made, the event will be reopened with a new look.

### Mail to Foreign Countries Should Use the Language of the Destination Country; Parcel Delivery to All Parts of Sichuan Temporarily Suspended

Shanghai Postal Administration issued Notice No. 1557 yesterday, stating that, according to Article 16 of the Postal Regulations, the name and address of the recipient on mail sent to foreign countries should be written in the common language of the destination country. If it is only in Chinese, it must be accompanied by a Roman transliteration. Hereafter, senders sending mail to foreign countries must strictly comply with these regulations to avoid difficulties in delivery in the destination country. This notice also informs that the Parcel Service Department has also issued two notices: (1) Due to transportation difficulties, parcel delivery to all parts of Sichuan, except for personal and medicinal parcels, is temporarily suspended; (2) Effective immediately, all bulk small parcel mail to all parts of Sichuan is temporarily suspended. Medicines and personal items will be accepted as usual. It is understood that the acceptance of large and small parcels to Kunming, Yunnan, and counties and towns along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway will resume next week.

### Street Vendors Near Julu Road Petition the Taxpayers' Association

There are more than 100 vegetable stalls and peddlers in the area of ​​Julu Road in the French Concession. They usually pay monthly license fees to the French Concession Tax Bureau and set up stalls for business according to their numbers. However, this month, about 100 new licenses were suddenly added, making it impossible for the original vendors to settle down and forcing them to suspend business. The old vendors specially sent representatives Li Yichen, Wu Rongsheng, Zhu Gaolin, Wu Jinbao, and Wu Shunji to petition the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting them to negotiate with the French authorities to transfer the licenses of the new vendors to other places. The secretary of the association received them and promised to report the matter and handle it impartially.

### The Huangpu River Has Not Been Dredged; Flood Prevention Work This Autumn Is Important; Heavy Rains at the Beginning of the Month Have Caused Flooding That Has Not Yet Receded; The Riverbed Is Getting Higher Every Day, and the Flow Is Not Smooth

Since the beginning of this month, from 0:00 on the 1st to 2:30 pm on the 3rd, due to heavy rain, the roads were flooded into canals. This flooding has not yet receded. For example, in Xuhui's Route Tenant de Villiers, Rue Contaut, Route Heger, and other places, the slow drainage is unprecedented. The reason for this is that the Huangpu River has not been dredged, the riverbed is getting higher every day, and the water flow is far less smooth than before. Therefore, the accumulated water on the ground cannot be quickly absorbed by the drains and discharged into the river. Even if it enters the river, it cannot flow smoothly out to sea. Therefore, according to this situation, Shanghai may have a fairly serious flood around the Mid-Autumn Festival this year. At that time, the tide will be high, and it will also be the rainy season. It will also coincide with the typhoon season. If these three factors coincide, then the impact on Shanghai's floods will be considerable. Therefore, the flood prevention work of warehouses and godowns this year must not be neglected.

### Famous Jockey Tong Zhenyuan Sued for Assault by His Wife; After Reconciliation, More Problems Arise; After Persuasion, Tong's Wife Withdraws the Lawsuit

Tong Zhenyuan, a famous jockey from Ningbo, is 36 years old. In 1927, he married Zhang Guomei (now 33 years old), a woman from the same hometown, and they have a son and a daughter. The daughter is 11 years old, and the son is only 4 years old. Later, Tong became fond of travel, which led to frequent quarrels within the family. They have been separated since 1936. Zhang lived with her father-in-law, Tong Wenbin (73 years old, owner of the Yichang Construction Company), at No. 3, Lane 929, Xinza Road, while Tong lived with his brother, Tong Zhenhu, at No. 24, Haifang Village, Haifang Road. This avoided conflict. In January of this year, Tong filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special First Court to request cohabitation with Zhang Guomei. During the trial, after mediation by the judge and friends, a settlement was reached with the following conditions: (1) Zhang Guomei should cohabit with Tong Zhenyuan at No. 24, Haifang Village, Haifang Road; (2) Tong Zhenyuan should abide by the legal system of one husband and one wife; (3) Tong Zhenyuan should pay Zhang Guomei 100 yuan per month for living expenses; (4) Tong should not abuse Zhang; (5) If Zhang Guomei encounters Tong Zhenyuan violating the settlement conditions, she may return to live at No. 3, Lane 929, Xinza Road.

The case was then concluded, and Zhang moved to No. 24, Haifang Village to live with her husband. However, on the afternoon of the 29th of last month, Zhang suddenly reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, saying that at 12:30 pm, during lunch with her husband, they had a quarrel over living expenses. Tong Zhenyuan then assaulted her, causing her injuries. She requested an investigation. Chinese Detective Tao Genrong and Detective Du Guozhen sent Zhang to the hospital, where it was confirmed that she had indeed sustained injuries to her left cheek. Tong was summoned to the police station. According to Tong's statement, Zhang had first thrown a rice bowl at his face. Since Zhang insisted on pressing charges, but Tong had a confirmed address, he was allowed to leave. A warrant was then issued by the Special First Court, and both parties were summoned to the Third Criminal Division of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Judge Huang Risheng opened the trial. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts and charged Tong with assault under Article 277 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Huang briefly questioned both parties about what happened, he persuaded Zhang Guomei, saying that since the injury you suffered is very minor, in order to avoid breaking the relationship between husband and wife, it is better to withdraw the case. If the defendant must be punished, it will only increase resentment and make it difficult to hope for reconciliation. Therefore, for the sake of your lifelong happiness, it is better to withdraw the case. Lawyer Li also advised her. Zhang then indicated that she was willing to withdraw the case, but requested that the court reprimand the defendant and warn him not to be violent again in the future. Judge Huang approved this, reprimanded Tong Zhenyuan, and then announced that the case would not be accepted.

### Rotating a Car Engine Results in Fatal Abdominal Injury

Gu Shou, a 32-year-old employee of the Huafu Transportation Company from Yangzhou, residing at No. 5, Lane 455, Hankou Road, was preparing to drive his old car near the lane entrance at around 7 pm the night before. Unexpectedly, the choke valve was difficult to depress, so he got out of the car and inserted the iron crank handle in front of the car to rotate the motor. However, after shaking it violently to the right, he accidentally lost control, and the crank handle suddenly recoiled violently to the left, causing the handle to hit Gu's abdomen, recoiling several times and injuring internal organs. He immediately turned pale and collapsed to the ground in pain. He was sent to the hospital for treatment but died at 3:30 am yesterday morning.

### A Woman Addicted to Gambling Sues Her Sister-in-Law for Defamation

Huang Zijian, from Fujian, currently works at the Chongqing Aviation Administration, participating in the war effort. His wife, Huang Lansheng, 34 years old, lives at No. 9, Jianye Li, Fuli Road, Muqiao. Because of his wife's misconduct, Huang Zijian instructed his cousin, Huang Xizhao (36 years old, residing at No. 1283, Route Lafayette), to monitor her. Huang Lansheng, because her husband was far away in Chongqing, became addicted to Huahui gambling. Therefore, Huang Xizhao sent a letter to her cousin Huang Zijian in March of this year, revealing the improper private life of her sister-in-law Huang Lansheng. Huang Lansheng, after receiving a letter of reprimand from her husband, recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Huang Xizhao of defamation. The case was heard by Judge Jiang in the Second Criminal Division yesterday morning, and both parties confronted each other in court, each with their own arguments. The court persuaded them to reconcile, but failed. After the arguments were presented, the court announced the conclusion of the trial and scheduled the verdict for July 15.

### Robbery at a Cigarette and Candy Store; One Thief Shot; Stray Bullets Injure Two Passersby

At around 5:15 pm yesterday, the Youli Candy and Cigarette Store at No. 1279, Yuyuan Road, was suddenly robbed by three bandits. One of the bandits was armed and grabbed all the business income from the store's cash register, totaling 20 yuan in legal tender, and fled. As they left the store, the owner and apprentices shouted "Catch the robbers!" At that time, Patrolman No. 2795, No. 2189, and a Japanese detective No. 1789 were patrolling the area. Hearing the alarm and seeing people running in panic, they immediately gave chase and ordered them to stop. The bandits were desperate and continued to run. The detectives and patrolmen then opened fire. The bandits also fired at the police. After chasing them to the vicinity of Hengchang Li, the armed bandit was finally shot down and captured on the spot, and a pistol was seized. The other two bandits had escaped. The captured bandit was taken back to the police station. He identified himself as Li Zhiming, but he was seriously injured and was first sent to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, two passersby were injured by stray bullets. One was Zhu Xigao and the other was Tian Junqing. They were also sent to the hospital for treatment after the incident.

### Child Drowns While Swimming

In the past two days, the weather has suddenly become hot. North Jiangsu children who live on boats are often seen swimming in the Suzhou River west of the Shancha Shipbuilding Plant and the area between Xinqiao and Youdaijiao. Yesterday (July 8) at around 2:00 pm, a group of North Jiangsu children were swimming naked on the banks of the Suzhou River near Youdaijiao. At that time, the tide was rising and ships were traveling westward one after another. One of the children, about eight or nine years old, was unable to cope after being in the water for too long and tragically drowned. The other children discovered this and searched for him everywhere at the bottom of the river, but could not find him. They then ran to tell his parents, who immediately drove a boat to search everywhere. They soon found him floating on the surface of the river about a mile west of Youdaijiao, but it was too late. The child's mother held the corpse and wept bitterly, which was very sad.

### New Factories Continue to Increase, Industrial Situation Improves Significantly, Some Factories Automatically Increase Workers' Wages, Very Few Fresh Cocoons Arrive, Affecting Silk Reeling Factories

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Section reported that the number of new factories under design in Xuhui last month was still considerable. The more important ones included two lead oxide and lead acetate manufacturing plants, one weaving mill and one cannery each, and two silk thread factories and two glass factories each. Forty-six new factories that had started operations were inspected, with yarn factories being the most numerous. Several factories located elsewhere have added branch factories in the eastern district of the city due to a shortage of raw materials. Recent additions include one hat factory, one oxygen factory, one motor assembly factory, one soap factory, one elastic band factory, and one medical cotton factory each. Recently, very few fresh cocoons have arrived, which has a significant impact on the future operations of silk reeling factories. If the blockade of various ports in eastern Zhejiang is implemented, the source of fresh cocoons will become even scarcer, and both silk reeling factories and silk weaving factories will be affected.

Working Conditions

One large yarn factory has seen significant improvements in its industrial conditions and the living conditions of its workers. The factory now stops work for half an hour every afternoon to allow workers to rest and drink tea provided by the factory. Thirty new shower heads are being installed, and once completed, workers will have the opportunity to shower regularly for free. The factory roof has been insulated to reduce the temperature inside the factory by six degrees Fahrenheit at all times. Wages have been increased by 8% since June. The factory also purchases rice and sells it to workers at a price of four yuan less per picul than the market price. In addition, several factories have also increased workers' wages by 10% to 20% depending on the cost of living.

Group Training

Last month, 70 boiler operators and supervisors from 53 factories received four hours of training per week in the northern district, led by two Chinese boiler engineers. The teaching methods used have proven to be quite effective. The owners of small light bulb factories held a second meeting to discuss the work standards they intended to try. The owners of leather factories also held a meeting and decided to dig a deep well for the use of 13 leather factories. The second meeting will discuss the issue of setting up a sedimentation tank.

Labor Disputes

The Industrial Section mediated two labor disputes. One occurred in a cigarette factory, where the factory wanted to lay off workers for seven weeks due to the relocation of the factory, leading to a dispute. As a result, the factory agreed to increase the number of working days for workers after the new factory opened. The other dispute arose when a silk weaving factory laid off 120 night shift workers. As a result, the factory agreed to pay severance pay and reached a compromise with the workers, which resolved the issue.

Steam Pressure Machines

A total of 14 boiler manufacturing factories have applied for registration in accordance with the regulations last month. Each factory has a designated boiler engineer to monitor the design and construction of various steam pressure machines and implement the regulations of the Bureau. The Industrial Section received a total of 62 steam pressure machine registration certificates and 37 installation inspection certificates. Experts inspected a total of 86 registered steam pressure machines.

Accidents

There were a total of 175 industrial and occupational accidents last month, including 9 fatalities. The causes of the accidents were confirmed in 159 cases. Detailed investigations were carried out and factories were ordered to take preventive measures in 49 cases. Of the above-mentioned accidents, 45 were related to machinery, including 2 fatalities. Two were due to the use of belt gears, and seven were due to the use of calendering machines, etc. 21 were related to the transportation industry. 33 were injuries from falling, including 1 fatality. 26 people were injured by falling objects, including 1 fatality. 5 people were injured by electricity, including 3 fatalities. 7 people were injured by explosions, including 1 fatality. 5 people were injured by molten metal, including 1 fatality. The factory with the most accidents was the yarn industry, with 34 workers injured, including 1 fatality. The next was the machinery and hardware industry, with 28 workers injured, including 1 fatality. 14 people were injured in the construction industry, including 2 fatalities. There were a total of 22 fires in factories. The causes of the accidents were found to be related to celluloid in 5 cases, with 6 workers injured, including 2 fatalities. 5 cases occurred in yarn factories, with 1 worker injured.

Cost of Living

The overall cost of living index for workers in Shanghai has continued to increase this year. In June, it reached as high as 176.15 (using the overall index of 1936 as the base). This number is 6.84% higher than the previous month, 15.48% higher than the same month last year, and 76.15% higher than before the Shanghai War. In other words, one yuan of national currency before the Shanghai War was only worth a little more than 56 cents last month. All types of indexes, except for clothing, have risen sharply. The rising price of rice has had a particularly severe impact on workers.

### Two Women Attempt Suicide by Poisoning

Shao Qiaozhen, a 20-year-old woman from Wuxi, residing in Room 58 of the Zhongshan Hotel on Ningbo Road, committed suicide by swallowing poisonous liquid in her room at around 10:30 am yesterday. She was discovered by a waiter and taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was later learned that the girl's husband, Xu Haiquan, originally from Wuxi, was a businessman in Shanghai. Recently, Qiaozhen brought valuables to Shanghai, but was deceived by villains and lost everything. She was ashamed to face people and took this drastic measure. It is reported that her father, Shao Dongsun, runs the Shaowan Shun Soy Sauce Garden on Jiangjia Lane, Gordon Road, and has some assets.

Shen Zhao, an 18-year-old local woman residing at No. 1007, Jin Situ Temple, Route Contaut, suddenly poisoned herself at home at 3:15 am yesterday due to a quarrel with her husband. She was sent to the hospital for treatment.

### Dispute over Property Division Leads to Elder Brother Being Pushed to Death. Death From Pushing Caused Hemoptysis Due to Lung Disease. Police Report and Seal Coffin Awaiting Examination and Verification.

Fan Siyu, a Chaozhou native residing at No. 23 Yuerli, at the intersection of Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, is 33 years old this year. He has four brothers. Siyu is the eldest. The second brother is Sili, 27 years old this year. The third brother is Sihong, the same age as Sili, and the youngest brother is Sizhang, 24 years old this year. Their father has passed away, and their old mother is still alive. However, Siyu has been suffering from lung disease for more than ten years. The old mother lives with Siyu, while the other brothers live separately and cook for themselves. Recently, due to a property dispute among the brothers, Siyu hid the old mother at a relative's house, preventing her from meeting with the other brothers. At 7 pm on the 6th, Sili, Sihong, and Sizhang, the three brothers, demanded from their elder brother Siyu that he hand over their mother and divide the property, leading to a verbal argument. Sihong and his younger brother pushed Siyu hard in the chest, causing Siyu to cough up fresh blood. His wife, Guo, hired a car to take him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The hospital, upon learning that Siyu had been injured and coughed up blood, reported it to the French police as a matter of routine. Police officers were dispatched to investigate and waited for him to recover before handling the case. Unexpectedly, Siyu died at 9 pm that night. The family did not report to the police but took the body to the Shanghai Funeral Home, where the body was placed in a coffin at 5 pm on the 7th, preparing to send it out for burial and temporarily store it at the Guotai Coffin Storage on Daxi Road yesterday. Sili, Sihong, Sizhang, and the other three brothers believed that their elder brother Siyu was killed by them and asked someone to mediate a settlement with their sister-in-law. In the morning, they hired a lawyer to represent them and submitted a request to the French General Police Station to close the case. The police considered that Fan Siyu died as a result of injuries and had not been reported beforehand, and it was inappropriate to request a closure of the case afterward. They dispatched investigators and sent Fan Siyu's coffin to the Coroner's Office for autopsy. Because there was no time to complete the autopsy procedures yesterday, they will summon the family members of the deceased and the accused to the case on Monday and request the Second Special Court to send personnel to open the coffin for examination to clarify whether the deceased died as a result of injuries, and then deal with it accordingly.

### Public Works Department Actively Carries Out Mosquito and Fly Eradication, Installs Larval Traps, and Uses Mosquito-Eating Fish and Larvicides.

The Public Works Department's Health Department of the Public Concession is quite concerned about the progress of summer epidemic prevention and malaria prevention. The following is a record:

Epidemic Prevention and Fly Eradication

The Health Department has added various testing stations and branches to inject epidemic prevention vaccines for residents of the concession. In addition, doctors and nurses are now dispatched to inject vaccines on various roads. In terms of fly eradication, several places have installed traps for fly eggs and larvae. However, this is a trial measure, and it is difficult to determine its effectiveness in the future.

Malaria Prevention and Mosquito Eradication

In terms of malaria prevention, the Health Department discovered 43 breeding sites for malaria mosquitoes in the previous month, 21 of which were in privately owned gardens. The breeding sites were in ornamental stagnant ponds. Therefore, the Health Department used mosquito-eating fish and larvicides, which were placed in the ground or sprayed, with good results.

By the time the police heard the news and dispatched officers, these people had already disappeared without a trace.

### French National Day, French Park Not Open

July 14th is the French National Day. The French authorities in this city held a military parade at 7:30 am that morning. The parade was reviewed by French Ambassador Gauthier and French Consul General Baudé. The parade participants were the French garrison, the Volunteer Corps, and the Chinese, Western, Yue, and Russian police teams. The parade location was the French Park, so the park was closed for the day.

### Dissatisfied with Parents' Arranged Marriage, Young Woman Sues for Cancellation. Defendant Requests Dismissal of the Lawsuit.

Huang Xuedi (22 years old this year), a woman from Dongting Mountain currently residing at No. 19 Zhufan Xinli, Xinzha Road, was engaged to her fellow villager Zheng Lingen (24 years old this year) on April 13, 1937. Since the two parties had disagreements, the wedding was never held. Now, Huang Xuedi believes that marriage is a major event in life and demands marital autonomy. She recently hired lawyer Wang Kanghou to file a lawsuit with the civil court of the Second Special Court, requesting confirmation that the engagement with Zheng Lingen was invalid, claiming that it was arranged by her mother and she did not agree to it. The court accepted the case and summoned the parties to the seventh courtroom yesterday for trial by Judge Li Liang. The defendant, Zheng Lingen, did not appear in person but hired a lawyer to appear in court, stating that the engagement was initiated by the plaintiff Huang Xuedi with the tacit consent of her parents. The plaintiff herself signed the engagement document in her own handwriting, so how could she overturn it at will? He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The plaintiff insisted that the engagement was forced by her parents when she was a minor and could not be recognized, because acknowledging it would forever ruin her happiness. After reviewing the arguments, the court ordered a debate and then announced the conclusion of the trial, setting July 12 for sentencing.

### Letter

To the Editor, I am writing to you regarding a news item in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on July 5, regarding the case against Minghe Factory. The content is slightly inconsistent with the facts. The plaintiff, my client Liang Yongao, has presented the stack receipts of Minghe Factory as evidence of the defendant Wang Zuolin's misappropriation of stored yarn. The defendant not only failed to provide evidence of delivery, but also claimed that Xue Jinman handled the matter, which is just empty talk and has no legal basis. Therefore, the court ordered the defendant to pay 8,000 yuan as security. Moreover, there is no mention of Xue Jinquan being a shareholder of Yunhua in Wang Zuolin's confession. The information in your newspaper must be due to reporter's error or someone's instigation with ulterior motives, all of which are sufficient to confuse the public. Therefore, I am writing this letter to correct it. I hope that you will publish this letter in the "Letters" column of your newspaper. Yours sincerely, Sun Zhongyao, Lawyer, July 8.

Correction. In the news item "A Large Number of Treasures Stolen from the Residence of the Director-General of the Four Lines Depository" published in our newspaper on July 5, according to the staff of the Four Lines Savings Society, there is no position of Director-General in the Society's depository, and an inquiry of the depository staff has revealed that there is no concubine named Ye living on Shanzhong Road. We have been instructed to make a correction and publish it above.

Education News

### Qualifications, Appointments, and Salaries of National Higher Education Faculty (Part 1) – During the Late Qing Dynasty, Listed as Civil Servants and Controlled by the Government – After the Republic, Universities Established Professorships, Assistant Instructors, etc.

(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The qualifications of faculty and staff in national higher education institutions (including universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools) have not been clearly surveyed in recent years. According to the Ministry of Education's 1934 statistics, among the 7,205 faculty members, 3,856 had studied abroad, 2,667 had graduated from domestic higher education institutions, and 56 had graduated from secondary schools. Among the 5,332 staff members, 1,148 had studied abroad, 1,913 had graduated from domestic higher education institutions, and 1,113 had graduated from secondary schools. The evolution of faculty qualifications, appointments, and salaries can be divided into three periods, which are described below:

(1) Guangxu Era of the Late Qing Dynasty

The Outline of Academic Affairs in the 29th year of Guangxu stated: "At this time, universities, higher schools, and ordinary schools in provincial capitals may still hire teachers from various Western countries." It is evident that in the early stages of establishing schools, the majority of faculty in universities and higher schools were foreign hires. Although officials were sent abroad to study at the time, it was not sufficient to meet the urgent need. The outline also stipulated that "From now on, all teachers in schools inside and outside the capital should be civil servants, known as teachers, and subject to the jurisdiction and control of the school's supervisor and headmaster. Their merits and demerits should be assessed and they should be promoted or demoted accordingly. They should not be treated as honored guests as in the past, as this would cause many obstacles. However, supervisors should also treat teachers with courtesy." This was the initial regulation on granting official titles to teachers and on their promotion and demotion. It also briefly regulated the term of office for teachers, "Whether it is three years, two years, or based on the graduation period of the school, those who are incompetent should be dismissed at any time, those who are excellent may be retained after the term expires, and those who are average should be replaced on schedule. They may not resign or seek other positions before the term expires." The regulations for faculty in universities were further systematized in the regulations for teachers in universities. Universities established a General Supervisor, equivalent to the current president, and Divisional Supervisors for each department, equivalent to the current deans. Under the Divisional Supervisors, there was "one Director of Academic Affairs, appointed from the most learned of the regular faculty members," "Regular faculty members were responsible for teaching specialized courses in the various departments, instructing in academics and guiding research," "Assistant faculty members assisted regular faculty members in teaching students and guiding experiments." Higher schools also had supervisors and deans, as well as regular and assistant faculty members. In summary, the regulations for faculty in universities and higher schools at the time only provided general regulations on titles, responsibilities, and terms of office. Detailed regulations on faculty qualifications, appointments, salaries, and professional development had not yet been established.

### The China Society of Natural History Opens Its 14th Annual Meeting – Awards Zhu Yuanding Medal

The 14th Annual Meeting of the Peking Society of Natural History was held at the Auditorium of Peking Union Medical College on the morning of April 15th.

The honorary secretary and honorary accountant reported on the society's affairs and financial situation. The chairman reported on the results of the election of new members and officers, as well as the activities of the publications department. Mr. Jin Shuchu, the founder of the society, established the Jin Family Gold Medal in memory of his respected father, Mr. Qin Yuan, and his wife. The medal is awarded annually to Chinese and foreign scholars who have made outstanding achievements in the study of Chinese zoology and botany. It has been awarded every year since its establishment without interruption. In the past, most of the recipients were in Peiping. This year, upon the recommendation of Dr. White, the medal was specially awarded to Professor Zhu Yuanding, Head of the Biology Department of St. John's University in Shanghai, to commend his contributions to the study of Chinese fish. Lectures were held in the afternoon. The newly elected officers are listed below: President, Li Ruqi of Yenching University; Vice Presidents, Bolari of Yenching University, Feng Lanzhou of Peking Union Medical College; Secretary, Zhong Huilan of Peking Union Medical College; Treasurer, Wu Zhaofa of Fu Jen Catholic University.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Reviews the Qualifications of Teaching Staff – To Improve Primary School Teaching

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Education Department believes that the academic knowledge and experience of teaching staff at all levels of schools is critical to the advancement of education. The department plans to conduct a strict review of the qualifications and experience of the staff of its affiliated and subsidized schools during this summer vacation in order to actively improve the future of primary schools in Shanghai. It is reported that the department has been planning various registration forms and is expected to announce them soon.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Closely Monitors Beverage Supply in Summer Schools – Many Chinese Children Suffer from Diphtheria and Typhoid Fever

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department in the International Settlement is paying close attention to the supply of beverages in the summer schools that are being operated during the hot summer months. According to the latest statistics on infectious diseases among students in the department's affiliated and subsidized schools, mumps are prevalent among Western children, while diphtheria and typhoid fever are more common among Chinese children due to seasonal factors.

### The Ministry of Education Grants Approval for Establishment of Zhaoguang Middle School

In view of the high cost of living in Shanghai, the plight of impoverished children unable to continue their education is regrettable. A group of enthusiastic educationists in Shanghai have joined forces with prominent figures in the business community to prepare for the establishment of a middle school, named Zhaoguang Middle School. The tuition fee for the entire senior high school is only 15 yuan, and only 13 yuan for the junior high school, which is the same as the tuition fee for provincial middle schools in the past. The Ministry of Education approved the establishment of the school because its fees are very low, which is in line with the aim of helping young people who have dropped out of school. Preparations are now complete, and recruitment advertisements have been placed in newspapers. The temporary office is located at No. 304 Pudong Fellow Association on Avenue Foch. All matters will be handled there before August 1st. At the same time, because the school does not admit many students, children from wealthy families are asked not to apply, so as not to occupy the places of others.

### Free Schools Established by the Out-of-School Relief Center

Since its establishment, the Municipal Poor Children's Out-of-School Relief Center has spared no effort in promoting free education throughout the city. The first phase of work at the center has come to an end, and the second phase has begun. Based on the outline for the implementation of free education at the National Education Conference, it was decided to divide the city into ten districts, with a free school established in each district, in order to provide widespread relief. It is reported that four schools in the British Concession officially started classes on July 1st, and two schools in the French Concession will start classes as soon as the French Municipal Council issues permits.

### Finance: Yinghui in Tianjin Contracts – Northern Traders Suddenly Purchase Gold – Prices Rose to Around 2,600 Yuan After Closing

Yesterday, the cash market was relatively weak during the morning session. Although Hong Kong traders were still interested in buying at the beginning, the eagerness of cash dealers and money changers to sell led to a decline in the market, which once fell to 2,573 yuan. At noon, Tianjin traders suddenly entrusted a certain money changer to aggressively buy at the low, and the market turned firm, rising back to 2,577 yuan at the close. Due to the foreign exchange market being closed on Saturday and the hot weather, it was decided to close the market in the afternoon. However, there were sudden rumors that the foreign exchange market in Tianjin was contracting sharply, and that the British gold had softened to four and a half pence. As a result, the local traders were even more eager to buy, and they entrusted securities dealers and a certain money changer to inquire with various firms over the phone. It was heard that transactions were once made at 2,585 yuan. Later, due to the scarcity of sellers, the price rose to around 2,600 yuan, so no further transactions were made. As a result, the official price fell by five cents, but in reality it rose by seven or eight yuan. The price of jewelry gold at silver shops remained unchanged. The prices of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also remained unchanged.

Cash Market Drops Officially But Rises Unofficially

From the morning, Hong Kong traders showed strong buying interest, causing the underlying momentum to be quite stable. The market opened 1.5 yuan higher. A certain gold firm bought 50 taels each from money changers and cash dealers on behalf of Hong Kong traders, both at a price of 2,579 yuan. However, due to the increasing selling intention of cash dealers and money changers, the supply temporarily exceeded the demand, and the price fell by 3 yuan in an instant. A cash dealer sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop (on behalf of Hong Kong traders), at a price of 76 yuan. A money changer also sold 50 taels to a securities dealer at the same price. The price then fell another yuan, and the money changer sold 40 taels to a cash dealer, at a price of 75 yuan. Shortly after, the price fell another 2 yuan, and a certain cash dealer sold 10 taels each to a gold firm and a fellow dealer, and 30 taels to a certain silver shop, all at a price of 73 yuan. At this time, Tianjin traders suddenly entrusted a certain money changer to purchase on their behalf, and the market suddenly rebounded. A certain money changer bought 50 taels each from a silver shop and a cash dealer, still at a price of 73 yuan. The price then rose by 2 yuan, and a certain money changer bought 50 taels from a fellow dealer at a price of 75 yuan. At noon, the price jumped another 2 yuan, and a certain money changer bought another 50 taels from a fellow dealer, with 77 yuan as the noon closing price. After the closing, Tianjin traders were still interested in buying, but there was no intention to sell, so no transactions were made. Due to the foreign exchange market being closed on Saturday and the hot weather, the traders decided to close the market in the afternoon. It was heard that Tianjin traders were even more eager to buy, and they entrusted securities dealers and a certain money changer to buy more, inquiring with various firms over the phone. It was heard that a certain money changer bought 50 taels from a cash dealer on behalf of Tianjin traders, at a price of 85 yuan. After that, the selling intention was very weak, and some sellers even asked for a price of 600 yuan, making it difficult to trade. As a result, the official price at the noon closing price of 2,577 yuan fell by five cents, while the actual price based on over-the-counter transactions rose by 7.5 yuan, fluctuating by 6 yuan in half a day. The cash dealers' standard gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot market, and the current margin gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, with no transactions.

Jewelry Gold Unchanged

The exchange price of jewelry gold in silver shops remained unchanged. Datong Bank still listed 261 yuan, and Xin Tongxing Bank listed 259 yuan for selling and 253 yuan for buying.

British Pure Gold Unchanged

A London dispatch on the 7th reported that the price of British pure gold remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce. As a result, the Central Bank's Chinese cash buying price remained at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price of customs gold remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained at 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao.

### Foreign Exchange Speculators: Roll August into July - Futures Arbitrage Temporarily Without Cash - Still Quoted by Banque Belge and Banque Franco-Chinoise - July Market Suddenly Tightens, Spot Prices Stabilize

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC quotes remained unchanged except for a slight increase of .25 for Hong Kong dollars. Spot trading in British and American currencies remained stable and quiet. Although foreign firms attempted to buy and foreign banks absorbed shillings midway through, British and American banks showed strong willingness to supply, coupled with exporters also selling, resulting in balanced supply and demand, and prices remained flat. The July futures market was also very stable initially, but weakened slightly at midday. Since the opening of August futures trading the day before yesterday, futures swaps and arbitrage did not require cash. With twenty-three days remaining until the end of July, wealthy Chinese merchants rushed to buy July and roll out August, paying forward premiums of 203.125 shillings and 375 U.S. dollars. The Banque Franco-Chinoise and Banque Belge, among others, were offering these rates, using an interest rate of around 3%. With strong buying pressure in July, the market suddenly softened. Although foreign firms and Sassoon & Co. attempted to buy August futures, foreign banks and speculators sold more aggressively. After initially strengthening, the market returned to flat by midday. Spot prices and July swaps widened again, with premiums of 15.625 British pounds and 28.125 U.S. dollars. Since interest rates were low (just over 2%) and cash was needed, no one considered arbitrage. Trading was brisk for half the day. The Hong Kong dollar situation remained unchanged.

This morning, London telegraphs showed a decrease of .0625 for near-term large bars, with no change for far-term. New York silver prices were unchanged, and London gold also saw no changes. Exchange rates: British pounds rose .6 hao against the U.S. dollar and were unchanged against Shanghai currency. The British pound rose 1 sheng against the French franc. The U.S. dollar remained flat against the British pound, Shanghai currency, and the French franc. Central Bank quotations for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 6 shillings 5.5625 pence for British pounds and 12.78125 yuan for U.S. dollars, unchanged from the previous close. After opening, exporters first sold to Banque Franco-Chinoise, Banque Belge, and the Netherlands Trading Society, with spot U.S. dollar rates at 12.8125 yuan. Subsequently, import firms and the foreign-owned Banque de l'Indochine competed to buy spot British pounds at 6 shillings 5.5625 pence from HSBC. Then, a foreign firm bought spot U.S. dollars at 12.78125 yuan from Banque Belge. As a result, the process was stable. When HSBC's rates were announced, only the Hong Kong dollar rate increased by .25, with all other rates remaining unchanged. When the silver balancing tax was announced, it remained exempt. Later, futures trading was quite active. Banque Belge sold July British pounds at 6 shillings 4.6875 pence to Banque Franco-Chinoise (on behalf of Tianjin). Subsequently, Banque de l'Indochine sold July U.S. dollars at 12.59375 yuan to Banque Franco-Chinoise. There was some swap trading, with an American bank swapping July and August contracts with a Chinese merchant, with the American bank paying the Chinese merchant a premium of 375 U.S. dollars, equivalent to an interest rate of about 3% per month. Later, a foreign firm absorbed August British pounds at 6 shillings 2.1875 pence from British Bank of the Middle East, while Sassoon & Co. also bought August U.S. dollars at 12.1875 yuan from speculators. The market remained quite stable. Near midday, there was only Hong Kong dollar trading, with the foreign bank Anta selling spot at 44.375 yuan, and the situation remained flat. At that time, the July and August markets weakened slightly as foreign banks' willingness to sell waned. By the afternoon close, bank spot selling prices were 6 shillings 5.5625 pence for British pounds and 12.78125 yuan for U.S. dollars. July futures were 6 shillings 4.0625 pence for British pounds and 12.5 yuan for U.S. dollars. August futures were 6 shillings 1.875 pence for British pounds and 12.125 yuan for U.S. dollars. In the end, compared to the previous night's close, spot British and American currencies saw no change. July British pounds were slightly tighter by .03125, and U.S. dollars were slightly softer by .0625. August British and American currencies remained unchanged. Hong Kong dollars, after being settled at the transaction price, also saw no increase or decrease. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.

### Tianjin Buyers Seek British and American Gold Notes

Yesterday, British pure gold and British and American exchange rates did not change. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms settled softly. Foreign banks supplied smoothly. Market prices were stable and unchanged. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. At the opening of Shanghai tael trading, money changers actively purchased, with the market price at a high of 2,579 yuan. Later, as gold shops increased their supply, the market price gradually declined, closing at 77 yuan at midday, a decrease of 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Trading did not open in the afternoon. Demand from the black market was strong, with the market price at 2,594 yuan. Demand for foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, was also strong, and the Shanghai tael black market was tight, leading to firm prices. Tianjin buyers were actively seeking British and American gold notes, and supply was tight. Furthermore, forward exchange rates were tightening, leading to firm market prices. Demand for Hong Kong and French franc notes remained strong, and prices all increased. Demand for Japanese yen notes was active, with an evening price of 9 jiao 9 fen 5 li. Supply and demand for Korean notes was sluggish, with an evening price of 8 jiao 7 fen. Transactions at the Chamber of Commerce were rare, with only Houji and Zhenxing issuing 50 British pound British gold notes. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds each increased by 5 jiao, British gold notes increased by 1 jiao 5 fen, U.S. gold notes increased by 9 fen, Hong Kong notes increased by 7 li, French franc notes increased by 7 hao 5 li, Canadian notes increased by 5 fen, Australian gold notes increased by 2 jiao, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Japanese Copper Scrip in the Hongkou District

Since the absorption of copper subsidiary currency in this city, it is unexpected that the Japanese "one-sen" copper coins (one sen is equal to one fen in national currency) circulating in Hongkou have also been decreasing daily. It is rumored that they are being collected as raw materials for manufacturing, replaced by newly issued "military scrip." The scrip is divided into three denominations: one sen, five sen, and ten sen. The design is smaller than our country's jiao currency notes. The front depicts a dragon and cloud pattern in brown and green. The back is written with the words: "This scrip can be exchanged for the Japanese currency amount stated on the front upon arrival. Any forgery, alteration, imitation, or knowing use will be severely punished." This means that the scrip can be exchanged for the currency amount stated on the front. Users who are forced to use it will naturally be aware of this. (This) is used as a printing plate afterward.

### Silver Price Decline Slows

London, July 7th dispatch: Silver market speculators selling, India buying a small amount. The market is flat, and the closing price remains flat. There are a few who want to buy at a price .0625 lower than the posted price, but there are also transactions at the posted price. The near-term price of large silver bars continues to fall by .0625, while the far-term price is unchanged. New York silver telegram: U.S. spot prices are unchanged. Bombay silver telegram: The Indian silver market is calm. Spot and July prices are down by 3 annas, and August is also down by 5 annas. The total number of contracts traded is 150.

### Discount Rate Decreases Again by One Yuan

The interbank lending rate at the Money Dealers Association remained unchanged at 2 jiao for both morning and afternoon.

Indian coal continues to arrive in Shanghai. The "Baron Ardrossan," managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., carrying 572 tons of coal loaded from Calcutta, will arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, mooring at buoys 31 and 32 for unloading and transshipment. (Zu)

### Securities: The Seventh Interest Payment - A Mystery Within a Mystery - Public Debt Market - Nervous Sentiment

Yesterday's over-the-counter securities market saw slightly anxious and uneasy sentiment. At the opening of trading, Class C bonds had already broken into the 9 yuan range. Later, with support from Xie Da, Datong, Yuyu, and others, they returned to and even surpassed the closing price of the 6th. The closing price was slightly soft. This volatility is due to the problem of the seventh interest payment, which has become a market mystery. Although various sources say that the payment will be made as scheduled, the Ministry of Finance has not yet made a definite statement. If the interest payment were to be made as scheduled, there would be no need for a statement. However, given the Reuters telegram and Minister Kong's recent pronouncements on financial policy, which did not mention domestic debt, people suspect ulterior motives. Furthermore, according to numerous rumors in the market, the government originally intended to temporarily suspend the due interest payment on the seventh public debt to ensure equal treatment for domestic and foreign debts. However, after requests from advisors, it agreed to temporarily have the Four Banks act as collateral. The detailed measures have not yet been determined. The reporter adheres to the principle of recording everything heard and will tentatively report what people are saying, awaiting confirmation of the facts. In short, in this uncertain and confusing situation, no one can make a definitive statement. According to the previous rumor of revised measures, there is reason to believe this is true. In short, the Reuters telegram is a mystery, and whether the interest payment will be made is also a mystery. Everyone thinks it's a mystery, and since they are unwilling to reveal this mystery, it is a mystery within a mystery. Both large and small speculators are taking advantage of the opportunity. Yesterday, Lianhe first sold and then bought, and Tiansheng first bought and then sold, showing uncertainty. At the beginning, Runli, Renchang, and others sold Class C bonds, retreating to the 9 yuan range. Later, Xie Da, Datong, Yuyu, Tong Guangshunheng, and others successively bought, while Tongshunxingyuan and No. 25 supplied a large amount, so the closing price was not much different from before. Class A, B, and E bonds were slightly better by 2 or 3 jiao, Class C bonds were unchanged, and Class D bonds were down by 1 jiao. Highs and lows alternated, and volatility was uncertain. The trading volume was over 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Compared to Previous Day
Unified A	60.40	60.00	60.40	Up 0.30
Unified B	51.25	50.90	51.25	Up 0.25
Unified C	49.70	48.90	49.60	Flat
Unified D	48.90	48.60	48.70	Down 0.10
Unified E	49.35	48.70	49.35	Up 0.20

Stock trading: 60 shares of Great China Match Company stock were traded at a price of 12.5 yuan.

Public Industries Association: Yesterday's stock market remained largely unchanged, but the underlying trend was good, and trading was sluggish. Jardine Matheson shares remained stable, trading at 18.8 yuan. Wheelock Marden shares saw slightly more demand at a price of 35 yuan. Telephone shares continued to advance, rising to 11.7 yuan. 5.5% Electricity Bonds rose slightly to a price of 82 yuan.

London, British-owned Far East companies stock prices on July 7th (Friday): All stocks were stable, and prices remained unchanged.

London, Chinese foreign debt prices on July 7th (Friday): Only the Hukuang Railway bonds fell by 1 pound each.

Crisp bonds were quoted for sale at 22 pounds, a decrease of 0.5 pounds from the market. Real goods were offered for sale from London, including 5,000 British pounds of Tianjin-Pukou original loan bonds, priced at 13 pounds, an increase of 1 pound from the market. Also, 5,000 pounds of Sino-French-American 5% dollar bonds (equivalent to 25,000 U.S. dollars), priced at 42.5 pounds.

### Grain: Flour - Officially Firm, Unofficially Soft - Japanese Merchants Continue to Buy New Wheat

Flour: The spot flour market continued to be quiet. Customer transactions have been suspended for many days. Although there have been sporadic transactions recently, there have been no wholesale transactions. This is all affected by the cash problem. Factories still adhere to the cash price of 4.65 yuan, and only a few hundred bags of recycled goods are traded at around 5 yuan, which is unofficially several fen to 1 jiao softer than the factory price. It was recently heard that the Beiyang merchants had bought a little, and together with the retail transactions in this street, there were a total of 20,000 bags traded. The future market prospects remain largely unchanged. Today, 90 bags of flour will be shipped to Qingdao.

Wheat: Yesterday, the supply of new wheat was not large. The main sources were still Jingzhen, Sudan, and other places. At present, the selling price in various production areas is difficult to relax, and cash is required for procurement. Therefore, traders are not as enthusiastic as in the past, and sellers are holding on. The market is stable. Unified market sales opened at 6.9 jiao for Suzhou Daqiao wheat, 8.5 jiao for Dachang wheat, and 7.5 jiao for Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Danyang wheat. 900 bags were traded, still purchased by local merchants and Japanese merchants.

### Japonica and Indica Rice Supply Exceeds Demand - Prices Increasingly Unsustainable

Du japonica: After falling for three consecutive days, yesterday the sales market in this street was even more sluggish. Inland merchants were also watching, causing sellers to shout even lower prices. The decline in all goods was unabated. Thick and thin japonica are prone to deterioration during this hot weather, so the market has a large inventory, showing a situation of supply exceeding demand. The market price fell by another 2 jiao. The routes for Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian are also relaxed, and prices also decreased by 1 or 2 jiao.

Bianyuan: Has become a complete failure. The market price fell by another 2 jiao. According to statistics, the city only received nearly 1,000 bags of Fengjing Bo rice. The number of transactions was still no more than 4,000 dan. Today is Sunday, and the rice market is closed.

Customer indica: There was a new arrival recently, but the inland merchants' buying interest has waned. They even stopped buying for a while yesterday morning, and then purchased small amounts at lower prices, making the purchase price even more stringent. However, sellers were very willing to sell, and some merchants also wanted to sell, so the market price was reduced by about 2 jiao. After the price was lower, local merchants started to buy more, so the number of transactions for the whole day was still about 3,000 bags.

Foreign rice: The market was quiet again yesterday. Recently, rumors in the market have repeatedly said that Saigon No. 2 rice has been continuously ordered, and the industry is quite weak. The current Saigon rice at 23 yuan is mostly watched by incoming merchants.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Beans - Fluctuating Prices

Yesterday's miscellaneous grains market was quite lively due to the market being closed on the previous day. As for the yellow bean market, prices fluctuated. Dalian Sipingjie beans have been purchased since the previous price drop, and some Xichang merchants have been interested, so the market price has rebounded by 6 or 7 fen, with 7 cars traded. The price started at 9.6 yuan and rose to 9.7 yuan. Wuhu beans also rose by 5 fen, with over 100 bags purchased by merchants in this street at a price of 9.45 yuan. However, Hankou beans continued to fall by 6 or 7 fen due to oversupply, with 1,500 to 1,600 bags traded at a price of 8.6 yuan with tax and 8.7 yuan delivered, and a tax-free bid price of 8.52 to 8.55 yuan.

### Dried Goods: Tianjin Red Dates Under Control - Shanghai Goods Transferred to Tianjin for Storage

Tianjin red dates' production prices are high because they are controlled by a certain party. As the goods in Shanghai are often moldy and cannot be stored for long, to avoid spoilage, they will be transferred to Tianjin for storage, as the north has no mold and is suitable for long-term storage. As a result, the goods in Shanghai are gradually becoming scarce, and prices have tightened again. Yesterday, red date king was sold at 80 yuan, red date heads at 65 yuan, head-grade red dates at 55 to 50 yuan, and second-grade red dates at 38 to 39 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Operators Are Bullish Again - Cotton Yarn Price Decline Abates - Yesterday's "Swap" Transactions Accounted for Over 1,000 Bales

The yarn market initially declined and then rebounded, but the price decline has abated. This is because Nanhua and Hong Kong merchants continue to actively purchase, stabilizing sentiment, and those with sufficient capital are coming back to buy, with bullish sentiments. As a result, inter-dealer trading is particularly prosperous. As for customer sales, apart from purchases from Hong Kong, there is no other demand, which is due to transportation issues.

The morning opening of the yarn market was sluggish due to unfavorable conditions. Small traders sold slightly, and Hong Kong merchants bought slightly. The opening price fell by 2 to 3 yuan. 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods were 477 yuan. Warehouse receipts were more expensive, but buyers were not enthusiastic. After a while, rumors spread that Hong Kong merchants were buying strongly and constantly purchasing coarse yarn, boosting confidence and tightening the market. Prices rose slowly. In addition, various parties reorganized and purchased hundreds of bales of warehouse receipts and spot goods, making the market look dry. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods was 483 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 477.5 yuan. After those who profited sold, the price retreated by 2 yuan, and the closing price was 480.05 yuan. The warehouse receipt price was 476.5 yuan. A total of 1,610 bales were traded throughout the day, and inter-dealer "swap" transactions accounted for 1,070 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 1 yuan, and other prices were largely unchanged from the previous day. The price of 20-count wool-blend yarn rose by 3 yuan. Today, 130 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Tianjin, and 65 bales will be shipped to Yantai. The amount purchased by each port is listed below:

Dealers: 1,070 Hong Kong: 485
Quanzhou: 115 Inland: 30
Total: 1,610

Latest news: According to some discussion, the news reported in this publication that a large number of cotton yarn exports would be shipped to various places on the 8th, with a total of 3,070 bales, aroused the curiosity of speculators, who speculated that the large sales volume would likely lead to price increases in the market next week. As a result, traders' buying sentiment suddenly became fervent before the close, and the market price turned from low to high.

### Cotton Trading Stalls - Industry Hopes Banks Will Accept Collateral

Foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market was active again yesterday. In the morning, the purchase from overseas cotton merchants and large inter-dealer transactions led to a high demand. Prices were further increased due to the elevated prices sent through telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai. There was a strong request that the banking sector take part in the market. As such, prices continued to rise due to high spot prices. Today is the first harvest estimate report for American cotton. Currently, the area planted is expected to be 25,411,000 acres, and the total production is expected to be 11,608,000 bales. Yesterday, New York rose 14 pounds, India, including forecasts, rose 2 rupees, and Egypt rose more than 20 pounds.

Trading in Shanghai's foreign cotton is becoming quieter, due to the tight money supply. It is rumored that the banks will accept cotton collateral next week. If this is true, then the cotton market may loosen slightly. However, the period for bulk orders is still far away. Recently, cotton merchants have deliberately delayed payments, which is not to the satisfaction of foreign firms. It is said that new transactions will require full payment before the order is signed, so future transactions will be much more difficult.

Transactions of Chinese and foreign cotton have stopped. The cotton that was purchased is arriving in large quantities, ready to be delivered. However, the buyers lack cash and cannot withdraw the goods. As a result, new transactions have completely stalled. As for the source of local cotton, it only relies on northern Jiangsu, but the amount is very small. Yesterday, 510 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock, as well as 565 bales from Beisha. Some spot cotton is being traded in rice.

### Speculators Refuse to Give Up - Cotton Yarn Market Struggles

The Shanghai cotton yarn spot market has been quite chaotic since the Ministry of Finance restricted deposit withdrawals, and there is a tendency to collapse. Many parties are taking advantage of this opportunity to stop trading. Although the industry once convened a meeting, the result was not much help, and over-the-counter transactions began. Seeing this situation, some retailers settled their positions, causing the market price to fall. Rumors of "circulating currency" and "treasury certificates" resurfaced, with differing opinions. Buying sentiment suddenly became fervent, jumping 20 yuan. 20-count Double Horse returned to the 500 yuan mark. Many people thought that the banks would open up after the mid-year settlement and that there would be a turnaround. Unexpectedly, the 50 million yuan exchange certificates from the banking and money industries began to be registered, and the financial situation was exceptionally stable. Gold fell, foreign exchange was extended, and securities flourished, indicating financial stability. A cloud of doubt was dispelled, greatly disappointing many parties. When the market opened, it not only failed to expand but contracted. However, wealthy individuals and collapsed households in banks still did not give up, so the market was soft but firm. However, in the past two days, a group of small merchants have been redeeming from the bank, coupled with the expensive exchange premiums, forcing them to cut their positions in the market. At the same time, customer demand was sluggish, so the market became stagnant and shifted downward, with a feeling of decline. However, the psychological attitude of large accounts is still bullish, arguing that all ports are currently closed, transportation is difficult, and the road is narrow, so future hopes are far away. Because the coastal defense has changed to a free port, the only transportation channel in the future will be to transport goods from Mazhang (near Guangzhou Bay). It is also said that Myanmar can also be connected, so the future is still optimistic, and yarn sales will develop indefinitely. However, this kind of ideal is feared to be too early to coincide with reality. Currently, the amount of yarn in the hands of merchants that has been used for collateral is not small, and the purpose is to wait for a good price to sell. Most of them were absorbed at high prices. If the date is long, the warehouse rent, insurance, and dismantling interest will increase. Secondly, if real sales are not smooth and the money is not loose, the goods issued by the factory in the past will gradually approach the deadline, and the factory will inevitably urge delivery. At that time, it is possible that the root problem will be solved. The fundamental issue still lies in the struggle for actual digestion. (Jin)

### Oilseed Cakes: Industry Silver-Futures Agreement Reached - Oil Market Turns Prosperous

Soybean Cake: The market (closed on the previous day), today is Sunday, so transactions were concentrated yesterday, resulting in higher prices for various oilseed cakes. 4,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji cakes opened at 3.06 to 3.08 yuan, more than 10,000 pieces of miscellaneous brand cakes rose from 3.045 yuan to 3.065 yuan, and 10,000 pieces of Tianjin soybean cakes were opened at 3.07 yuan, an increase of 4 to 5 fen compared to before the holiday.

Oil Market: The market was even more active yesterday, because the industry's problems concerning the selling and buying of silver futures responsibilities have been resolved (detailed in this publication on June 29). The Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Cake Industry Association has filed and maintained a 10-day silver futures market, which gives both buyers and sellers considerable room to maneuver, resulting in greater trading and market prices rising. Peanut oil rose by 0.5 yuan, with 200 units of Jiaozhou raw oil traded at 34 yuan, 100 units of coming-from-warehouse raw oil at 34.4 yuan, and 100 barrels of Dalian barrel raw oil at 45 yuan. Soybean oil rose by 8 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the previous market, with a total of 2,300 to 2,400 units of various oils traded (market prices are detailed in the market price column). The destinations were local, inland, Yangtze River, and Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods: Market Prices Downward - Mill Cloth Increased Prices - East Cloth Fell Further with No Transactions

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, the market continued to decline. Selling was done to ease the urgent need for silver. Some retail customers cut losses at reduced prices, revealing low prices. However, due to cost issues, mills required all goods to be priced at least 1 yuan higher than the market price per piece, which was difficult to accept. Therefore, most merchants remained calm and continued to buy and stock up on cheaper goods. As a result, the decline in cloth prices was slow. Selling was very chaotic. Yesterday, prices continued to fall by 5 fen to 2.5 jiao per piece. Spot sales were scattered. Merchants along the Jinpu Railway in Yanshi, Shangqiu, and Xuzhou bought over 2,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored serge, printed straight tribute twill, and Cantonese merchants bought over 3,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored serge, and colored patterned cloth. Over 20 packages of fine twill, Yunnan merchants bought over 2,000 pieces of colored cloth, flannel, and serge. Large Pengfei Hong and other brands of fine cloth and twill were 50 packages. Local merchants searched for 50 to 60 packages of fine twill, and dyeing factories also bought over 100 pieces of lower-grade Changzhou fine twill. Retail transactions of cut pieces in northern Jiangsu traded over 1,000 pieces of spun silk and colored cloth. Overseas purchases by Singapore and Little Luzon continued to be strong. Bleached, dyed fine twill and fine cloth traded over 1,000 pieces.

East Cloth

The market for white fine twill remained sluggish and declined further yesterday, with prices continuing to fall by 1 jiao to 2 jiao. Spot goods of Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 13.6 yuan, and futures fell to 13.75 yuan. Most people in the industry were pessimistic, so the more the market price fell, the fewer transactions there were. The situation of depression is difficult to change for the time being.

Export

Today, 15 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Yantai, and 20 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin. However, 200 pieces of piece goods were shipped from Hong Kong.

### Sales Season Not Yet Arrived, But Horsehair Sleeve Linings Are Already Being Bought - 23 Cases of Wool Yarn Arrived Yesterday

Horsehair sleeve linings: Recently, local merchants have been collecting them because they are aware that the sales season is approaching. Since the reduction of foreign exchange and restrictions on deposit withdrawals, small marine households have seen a sharp increase in raw materials and a lack of currency head linings, making it difficult for them to develop as before. Therefore, many are buying in advance, and over 100 pieces have been traded. Prices are mostly kept secret. It is said that the price of Grade 2 goods is 6 jiao 7.5 fen per yard in legal tender.

Also, 23 cases of wool yarn arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Continues to Rise

Yesterday's sugar market: No. 24 raw granulated sugar, local warehouse goods were 29.8 jiao, foreign warehouse goods were 6 jiao, and transit goods were 21.4 jiao, with 1,100 bags traded, and 4.5 jiao for 200 bags. This is a rise of 1 jiao. According to a Dutch telegram, August was 8.6 jiao, and September-October was 8.25 jiao. A Hong Kong telegram indicated that the port charge for raw granulated sugar was 10.08 Hong Kong dollars. Tai B brand West warehouse goods were 30.06 jiao, the East warehouse bid was jiao, CW was 30.06 jiao, DY was 29.7 jiao, with a total of 600 bags traded. CX was 30 jiao, HX was 29.5 jiao, and H red was 21.5 jiao, all rising by 2 to 3 jiao. According to the London telegram, August was 8 shillings 0.25, down 0.125, December was 6 shillings 3.25 pence, up 0.25, and March was 6 shillings 4.25 pence, up 0.215. Dutch red, etc., remained largely unchanged. For domestic sugar, the Chao merchants opened 50 bags of cotton red at 22 yuan, 40 bags of ice flower white at 17.2 jiao, and 60 bags of Huizhou sub-white at 17.4 jiao.

### Metals 　 Zinc Sheets and Rivets Both Rise

Zinc Sheets: Overseas transactions have not shown any development, and business for local factories is also sporadic, so the overall market trend feels stagnant. However, inventories are extremely low, and no new goods have arrived. Therefore, those holding goods have high aspirations and harbor thoughts of hoarding. As a result, asking prices are exceptionally high. For example, No. 2 is sold at 300 yuan per barrel, No. 3 is asking for 310 yuan, No. 5 is 195 yuan, No. 6 is 285 yuan, and Nos. 7 and 8 are both asking for 275 yuan per barrel. Other thick patterned varieties are asking for prices ranging from 300 to 320 yuan each. It was found that only 20 to 30 barrels were sold yesterday and the day before, with the varieties being No. 5 and No. 9. Buyers were battery factories and printing houses. Other tea companies, cigarette factories, toy factories, etc., rarely made purchases beyond inquiries.

Rivets: In recent days, the Tianjin suppliers have shipped as many as four to five thousand barrels. Furthermore, local hoarders and construction companies also have healthy appetites, leading to factory output not being able to meet demand. Moreover, raw materials (such as raw silk, etc.) have been extremely scarce in recent days. As a result, it is heard that certain factories are facing the risk of suspension due to a lack of raw materials. Therefore, factories and industry peers alike have very firm intentions, unwilling to compromise on selling prices. The asking price per barrel is 21 yuan, 25 cents higher than the selling price of the previous day. It is heard that financial magnates and money lenders have also been placing many orders recently, hence the market is lively and morale is high.

### Silk and Tea: Demand from England and France for Green Tea is Constant

Yesterday, green tea was being actively sought after by English and French trading houses due to urgent demand from abroad. However, factory output was limited, and supply could not meet demand, leading to firm confidence and rising prices. Yesterday, the whole city, including companies like Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Butterfield & Swire, and Wing On, purchased more than 800 cases of goods such as selected bud, precious eyebrow, and fine needle teas. Selected bud teas opened at 348 yuan, and standard precious teas opened at 290 yuan, an increase of 7 or 8 yuan compared to before. On the 8th, 310 pieces of tea leaves arrived from Hong Kong.

### Inspection of the New Capital Hotel

— (Fan Meng)

Scheduled to Open on the 14th of this Month; Over Two Hundred Craftsmen Rushing Day and Night

More than a month ago, the New New Company decided to cancel its original amusement park and rebuild the current "New Capital Hotel."

At that time, I spoke with Mr. Xiao Zongjun of the New New Company about this issue. His reasoning was: rather than having such a half-dead, ordinary amusement park, it would be better to rebuild a venue more suitable for the enjoyment of the upper class. In the past, they themselves were dissatisfied with the various facilities in the New New Rooftop Garden, so they decided on this plan for the New Capital Hotel.

In the past few days, it has been said that the internal construction of the New Capital Hotel is almost complete, so I visited Mr. Li Ze, the general manager of the New New Company, and he told me that the opening date of the New Capital Hotel is:

"The opening date of the New Capital has been set for the 14th of this month, at which time we will not be preparing for excessive extravagance."

Mr. Li also introduced me to a Mr. Zheng Jiaju, who accompanied me on a full tour of the New Capital Hotel on the sixth floor. Before the New Capital opens, I will first outline a simple sketch for the readers here.

It is said that the total cost of this project for the New Capital Hotel is more than 100,000 yuan. It includes five venues on the sixth floor: (1) Chinese cuisine department and tea room; (2) Hollywood-style glass broadcasting studio; (3) Auditorium; (4) Cloud Dress Dance Hall; (5) Shanghai Opera Stage.

The seventh floor, which is the rooftop garden, has a Western cuisine department and a dining area converted from a grape trellis.

Except for the seventh-floor rooftop garden, which is not air-conditioned, the entire sixth floor is air-conditioned.

When we walked onto the sixth floor, I immediately smelled a strong, pungent odor of "polish" and paint. The floors were also covered with sawdust and wooden boards everywhere. It is said that one or two hundred masons and carpenters are now rushing day and night to ensure that the opening is scheduled for the 14th.

This entire sixth floor is quite spacious and high. In my personal estimation, its area is no smaller than the second floor of the Great East.

This part is mainly the Chinese cuisine department, although it is also a tea room. When we visited, almost all the tables and chairs had been arranged. Currently, they are rushing to complete the construction of several restaurants in the Chinese cuisine department.

Sixteen Advertising Restaurants

The unique feature of the New Capital Hotel can be considered these individually decorated restaurants.

There are sixteen of these restaurants in total, each contracted and decorated by a different store or factory. Therefore, changing restaurants is like visiting a new store.

For example, there is the Green Treasure Hall, the Star Hall, the Mayar Hall, and the Sinyi Hall, etc. The interior decoration is not only different in color but also completely different in style.

A new advertiser can attract their patrons anytime, anywhere. This kind of advertising-style restaurant in the New Capital Hotel seems to have also opened up a new path in advertising art.

A Transparent Broadcasting Studio

Now let's talk about the glass broadcasting studio:

This broadcasting studio does not occupy a very large space, but having such a transparent broadcasting studio in Shanghai's broadcasting industry can indeed be considered a first.

The glass broadcasting studio is located at the entrance of the elevator. There are four publicly broadcasted performances: (1) from 12:00 noon to 1:20 pm, the program is singing and dancing; (2) from 3:20 pm to 4:00 pm, it is the comedy of Jiang Xiaoxiao, etc.; (3) from 4:00 pm to 4:40 pm, it is female storytelling; (4) from 6:40 pm to 8:00 pm, it is the All-Star Singing Association.

Apart from these four times, the rest of the broadcasting is not public.

Now the Revolving Palace is Renamed Cloud Dress

I also visited the Cloud Dress Dance Hall and the Shanghai Opera Stage. The Cloud Dress Dance Hall is the former Revolving Palace Dance Hall led by Hai Lisheng. My impression of it is that the decoration is very exquisite, but not high enough. Inside, there are four long, recessed sofa chairs, reminiscent of the old Grand China Venus.

The Shanghai Opera Stage is the former Peking Opera Stage, now slightly renovated. The troupe is the well-known Xiao Wenbin.

The seventh floor is the rooftop, where the air is very smooth. It would be nice to catch some cool breeze up there at night. If you could see the night view of Shanghai from the restaurant converted from a grape trellis, it would also be a very interesting thing.

### Rice as Pearls, Firewood as Cassia, Vegetable Prices are High: Meal Delivery Companies Emerge

— Simon

Delivered on Time Regardless of Distance 　 Each Meal Ranges from Eight to More Than Ten Yuan

Rice costs more than 20 yuan per picul, pork costs one yuan for one catty and four ounces, and one corner of a yuan cannot buy one catty of green vegetables.

Under these circumstances, after suffering from the problem of housing, the people of Shanghai are now facing the problem of eating. Even for a very small family, the food expenses are at least doubled compared to before the war, but even though the money has doubled, the food is not as plentiful as before.

Originally, cooking your own meals was cheaper and more delicious than eating delivered meals, but that is no longer the case. It seems that eating delivered meals is cheaper. Perhaps some people will doubt that the owners of meal delivery companies do not want to make money and are willing to take a loss, but I have my own point of view that eating delivered meals is cheaper than cooking your own meals under today's circumstances.

Just to give my own experience, cooking your own meals requires at least two piculs of briquettes per month. The current price is two yuan per picul, for a total cost of four yuan. The matter is even more complicated than that. The maid hired at home spends at least half a day busy buying vegetables and cooking. If you don't hire a maid, your wife has to cook and take care of the children, which is really too much. Perhaps this maid is mostly hired for cooking meals.

Now, hiring a maid costs at least five yuan per month, and with rice prices at more than 20 yuan per picul, the food probably costs more than five yuan, so hiring a maid costs twelve or thirteen yuan per month for wages and meals. If you eat delivered meals, although the food will definitely not be cheaper than buying and cooking it yourself, you can save two piculs of briquettes, and if the population is small, you can also save on hiring a maid. Wouldn't you save fifteen or sixteen yuan per month in your expenses?

Because of rice as pearls and firewood as cassia, some of my friends want to eat delivered meals to save on hiring a maid. However, as everyone knows, most of the general meal delivery companies are not very clean. Eating unclean food affects health, especially now in the normal summer season, when flies are flying all over the yard. Eating food cooked by other people is always a bit unsettling. Thinking about hygiene issues, even if you want to eat delivered meals, you will hesitate and still cook it yourself under severe pressure.

However, Shanghai is Shanghai after all. Now, some people have seen this point and opened a Shanghai Meal Delivery Company, which opened on July 1st. This meal delivery company is relatively large in scale and pays considerable attention to hygiene. If you order meals, they can be delivered on time regardless of the distance. The contact point is at 460 Chengdu Road, and each meal ranges from eight to more than ten yuan.

Meal delivery companies are undoubtedly a new business, and this new business can allow ordinary small families to save on hiring maids, save on buying briquettes, and reduce the severe pressure of living expenses. But our only hope is that this meal delivery company can truly achieve the goal of saving food expenses and ensuring the safety of life for the citizens, that all the food is cooked with attention to hygiene, and that the prices are reasonable. Then, this new business will surely have considerable development prospects.

### (2) On the Method of Doing Things

— Xie

The first thing to consider when doing anything is to establish a pure intention and a bright and upright purpose. A pure purpose is to people's actions what the soul is to the inner body, form to substance, the root to the trunk, the sun to the world, the source to the river, and the foundation to the pillar. A body without a soul is a walking corpse, substance without form is rustic and unrefined, a trunk without a root is a dead tree, a world without a sun is dark and lightless, a river without a source will soon dry up, and a destroyed foundation will cause the pillars to collapse. If the intention is not pure and the purpose is not bright, then the behavior will surely be base and unhelpful to others. To establish a pure intention, you must follow these suggestions: (1) Before doing something, you must think about its consequences and recognize what the purpose is. (2) When doing something, you should do it in the name of God, which means (1) you should not do anything that does not conform to God's truth. (2) When doing something, you should aim to glorify God; even if you do not see the glory temporarily, the result will surely glorify God. (3) You must not turn the original good intention into a malicious one. (3) Before starting a major undertaking, you must first pray, not only asking God to complete your undertaking but also asking God to accept what you are doing as a gift to God, in order to seek God's grace. (4) When doing things, you must always recite a few words from the Bible to prevent our pure intentions from changing. For example: "Lord, do not give glory to us, but to the Lord Jesus."

### The Phantom of the Ancient Castle

— Ru Hua

The Hound of the Baskervilles

Produced by 20th Century Fox 　 Shown at the Grand Light Theater

I have read many of Conan Doyle's "Sherlock Holmes Cases." I feel that in addition to portraying Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Watson as meticulous and courageous in resolving people's crises, the author also uses his scientific basis in each case to break many seemingly mysterious superstitions in the world. However, readers are often fascinated by his writing skills and neglect the author's intentions.

In "The Phantom of the Ancient Castle," the Baskerville family members were killed by hounds because people thought that the Baskervilles had committed crimes and therefore received their just deserts. Conan Doyle, through the great detective Sherlock Holmes, wrote a tortuous and bizarre story and ultimately revealed that the reason for the occurrence of this case was due to other social causes.

The "Phantom of the Ancient Castle" on the screen is quite faithful to the original.

The director's portrayal of the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Watson, in my view after reading Conan Doyle's original work, feels like Sherlock Holmes' pipe is always in his hand, and he deliberately plays his violin calmly during tense moments, and Watson's impersonation of Sherlock Holmes, etc., are all like the characters in the original work.

The three things that serve as important clues: the cane, the leather shoes, and the photograph, are all solemnly introduced by the director. The suspense created during their introduction is very clever. For example, when introducing the cane, he brings out Dr. James, but Dr. James does not appear in many subsequent scenes, and only when Henry Baskerville returns to the castle at the end does he specifically write about James driving the carriage away first. When introducing the leather shoes, he brings out a maid; when introducing the photograph, he uses Sherlock Holmes' tracking shot to show that he has discovered something in this photograph.

The atmosphere of terror also intensifies step by step. After Sherlock Holmes and Watson announce their return to London, the director's skill in writing about the development of all aspects at the same time is admirable.

This film also benefits greatly from the help of photography and sound. For example, when each suspicious character appears and in the surrounding environment of the wasteland, the angle of the camera and the light can be used to enhance the terror. When Sherlock Holmes follows the small path after the carriage overturns, the sound of the dog barking, from far to near, increases the tension of the atmosphere at that time.

Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes is played calmly and powerfully, and the guttural sound after disguise becomes very natural. Other actors such as Nigel Bruce as Watson and Lionel Atwill as Dr. James also work hard.

"The Phantom of the Ancient Castle" can be said to be a masterpiece in detective films.

### Fan Pages in Collaboration Between Xu Jilin (Calligraphy) and Ji Peng (Painting) Brothers

### Biographical Sketches of Female Storytellers

— Shen You

Yan Lizhen, in his "Short Biography of Female Storytellers," refers to female storytellers as having four types of "art": Chen Zhixiang, Xu Baoyu, Wang Xueqing, and Yan Lizhen, and each is discussed in turn. He states, "Zhixiang's voice is clear and melodious, and she analyzes the four tones and seven sounds in detail. Her storytelling has almost been polished by talented scholars, surpassing the original legends. The words are elegant and the language is witty, captivating listeners. Her deliberate depictions are logical, emotional, lifelike, and divinely skillful. Baoyu is broad and unrestrained, with a heroic spirit. She can suddenly become hoarse and scolding, or suddenly funny and comical, better than watching a play, achieving unexpected victories, a separate school among women. Xueqing's narration is thorough and concise. Lizhen excels at painting sadness, conveying thousands of words in silence."

The introductions to each person's artistic achievements can be said to be very detailed. Among the four, Lizhen is the most famous, and her tone is the most "stable." The Han River guest once wrote a poem about her, saying, "Old generation of romantic Yan Lizhen, a glance on stage seems affectionate. People compete to listen to her Buddhist and secular tales, each word clear in the sound of strings," which is also an explanation of "stable." Wang Tao's "Maritime Amusements Record" once wrote a biography for her:

Yan Lizhen is from Suzhou. After the Taiping Rebellion, she moved to Shanghai. She is skilled in southern storytelling, unmatched by anyone in her craft. As she aged, her fame increased. She planned to travel to broaden her horizons, traveling through Jiangsu and Zhejiang for two years. In the winter of Yihai, she rented a residence in Huzhou and performed for the local officials. Listeners were captivated, and the gold and jade in her hair were soon coveted by bandits. In November, she rented a boat to Shanghai and anchored near Wucheng County at night. At the third watch, whistles sounded everywhere. Everyone looked at each other in panic, and then a group of bandits stood at the bow of the boat with their blades drawn. Lizhen was afraid and wanted to throw herself into the river, but a bandit holding her in the dialect of Huzhou saved her from death. However, in an instant, the boat was looted, and they passed on to other boats, taking goods worth about 1,500 yuan. The next morning, she reported to the local security and planned to report to the county for investigation. A certain gentleman in the town, who was on good terms with Lizhen, quickly came to comfort her upon hearing the news and advised her not to report to the government, believing that these bandits were not real bandits or smugglers. If she reported it, the stolen goods would be difficult to recover, causing only trouble. Lizhen then asked the gentleman if he would be willing to build a fence at a key point to benefit travelers. The gentleman agreed, and Lizhen set sail back to Shanghai. Alas! The savings from years of singing and dancing were used to satiate the greed of bandits. Grief and indignation mixed together, what more could be said? Yet she still wished not to report to the government, and her plan to prevent theft in the future showed that she was a person of great understanding. Lizhen later changed her surname to Jin and her name to Sujuan.

This biography focuses on Lizhen's character, while her artistic achievements are not as detailed as in Shi Pingsou's biography. Rencqiu Jushi commented on her as "often teaching talented people to submit after the song," which is very appropriate. However, she is not "beautiful." Shi Pingsou once joked about it, saying, "I once said to a friend, 'Yang Longyou once said to Li Zhenli, "Beautiful, yes, but chaste, not so much." Is it possible that Yan Lizhen is the same?' My friend said, 'Perhaps chaste, yes, but beautiful, not so much.' I was surprised by his affirmation of her chastity, and he said, 'When her beauty fades, her lack of chastity will seem like chastity.' I said, 'Your words are too harsh.'" The words are indeed harsh, but it is difficult to determine whether Shi Pingsou's words outside of her artistic achievements are truly fair. Being biased to one side or the other is due to subjectivity, which is difficult to avoid.

Regarding Zhixiang, there is already a saying in Yue E's biography. The "Shanghai Book Immortal Flower List of Dingchou" calls her a "heroic character," comparing her to "difficult to crown." The commentary is extremely humorous, saying, "Wind rises beside her ears, fire comes out of her nose," and her actions are clearly not straightforward. Xu Baoyu's affairs are unknown. Only a poem given by Qingxiao student from Baixia was found in the "Shen Bao" at the time, as one of the "Five Storytellers' Poems." The poem says, "Speaking through the dreams of foolish people, they want to wake up, only then do they know that the tongue is clever and the heart is more intelligent. It is not easy to be comical in the world, how can it be less than Liu Jingting in his time?" Presumably, she was quite good at telling "jokes." The Han River guest also has a quatrain praising her: "A new song with a melodious voice. The middle-aged Xu Niang is still romantic. The book building talks about being favored, who knows the body of Biyu back then?" It is a pity that it does not mention her artistic achievements. Wang Xueqing is known for her skill in telling stories in vernacular. Wang Tao once recorded:

Wang Xueqing is good at telling stories in vernacular, with a jade face and a pearl voice, a gentle string and a crisp pipe, truly soul-stirring. At noon and early evening, she often performs in the Luoshen Hall of the Land Temple. Listeners sit side by side, and every word she says is delightful, and wealthy young men compete to please her, all worrying that they will not be able to please her. (5)

### Mao Jianqiu, Yu Guifen, and the Affair with the Romantic Thief

— (Jade Flute)

Each Hires a Lawyer to Sue Jiang Jianqiu

Mao Jianqiu, the pillar of the female role in the Gong Stage, was recently falsely accused by the romantic thief Jiang Jianqiu, who testified in court that he had been intimate with Mao Jianqiu and that Mao had given Jiang jewelry such as diamond rings and gold bracelets. (See the local news section of the newspaper on the 7th for details) Mao Jianqiu and Jiang Jianqiu sharing the same name, Jianqiu, is quite a coincidence. After this news was published in the newspapers, Mao Jianqiu cried bitterly once. Later, after receiving a letter from Jiang Jianqiu from prison, she laughed heartily once. The crying was because she was falsely accused for no reason, and the laughing was because she thought the matter was so comical that it was unexpected. Now, there are two points that can prove Mao Jianqiu's innocence: First, Jiang Jianqiu testified in court that he had been in a room with Mao Jianqiu at the Da Fang Hotel on March 18, but in the letter he wrote to Mao Jianqiu from prison, there was this sentence: "Recalling when you and I met on April 2 in the French Garden." Comparing the dates, the "room date" was before the "meeting," which is an excellent rebuttal! Second, according to her stage manager, Zhou Jianxing, Mao Jianqiu is always accompanied home by her mother (Mao Yunke's wife) after each performance, and Mao Jianqiu gets up very late every day and would never be able to visit the French Park in the early morning (as Jiang's letter stated). One more point, Mao Jianqiu lives at 61 Gaofu Lane, Sacred Heart Road, Pushi Road, but Jiang's letter mistakenly wrote 41 Gaode Lane.

Since Mao Jianqiu's part of the matter is unreliable, then Yu Guifen and Yao Yuchan, two female performers (both are married, Yu's partner is Wang Yigong, who used to run the Red Star Theater. Yao is the former Yuan Mudan, married to a Zhu, known as Big-Nose Zhu, currently living in Nanjing.), are of course also being falsely accused.

Now, Yu Guifen and Mao Jianqiu, in addition to reporting to the Performing Arts Union, will also hire lawyers to file lawsuits against Jiang Jianqiu for defamation and damage to reputation. Yu Guifen has entrusted Fan Gang Law Firm to handle the case through her husband, Wang Yigong. Mao Jianqiu has hired lawyer Jiang Yiping. The accused side believes that Jiang Jianqiu's false accusations may have been instigated by someone, so legal action is necessary. If the false accusations lead to a heavier sentence, then this romantic thief will truly have brought it upon himself.

### Song Dezh, a Talented Graduate of the Former Capital Opera School, is Coming to Shanghai

— Master of the Aiping Studio

After the performances of Yan Jupeng and Hou Yulan at the Golden Grand Theater, the theater temporarily switched to showing movies due to the hot weather, which was not suitable for performing Peking opera. It is rumored that Song Dezh has been invited for the next round of opera. Song is a talented graduate of the Former Capital Opera School. After graduating, she formed a troupe (Haoguang Troupe) and performed in the Former Capital. Due to her superior artistic skills, she was enthusiastically welcomed by all walks of life. People in Shanghai have long admired her name and regretted not being able to see her. Now that Song has been hired by the Golden Theater and is about to come to Shanghai to perform on stage, it will surely be a breath of fresh air for opera lovers in this city.

Dezhu was originally a martial arts performer, but due to a lack of talent in the opera school, she also performed roles of the "flower shirt." Her performance style combines the styles of Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, and Xun Huisheng, with Shang's style being the most prominent, followed by Xun's, and then Cheng's. However, it is a strange thing that she studied with Cheng and Xun but had very little contact with Shang.

Since Dezh is skilled in martial arts, her martial arts skills are of course excellent, and her movements are especially called a masterpiece, refined and fiery. Among the current actors, she is considered the best. What a pity is that it is rumored that her soft skills seem to be slightly weaker than Xun Huisheng's, which is a blemish on perfection.

In terms of acting, Dezh's acting is slightly less delicate. Flower Dan operas place great emphasis on acting, often using expressions to convey emotions. Dezh has not studied flower dan operas in depth, which is not a problem. With Dezh's talent and intelligence, if she can practice for a long time and seek delicacy, it will not be difficult.

Dezh's singing used to be less fluent. She was not good at inflection, could not distinguish between strength and softness, and her singing always felt unfamiliar and stiff. This was really due to her practice of martial arts. Recently, she has been diligently tuning her voice in the hope of being able to sing more 工剧 operas. It is hoped that she will become popular in Shanghai. Moreover, Dezh's appearance is beautiful, tall without being gaunt, and thin without being emaciated. She can really be described with the words "romantic charm"!

Before Yu Yushuang came to Shanghai last year, it was rumored that Dezh would come with her. I was happy and excited, but due to other reasons, it did not happen. This time, she is coming to Shanghai to perform as the leading role. Her performance will definitely be excellent. I hope she will make special efforts and not let down the hard work of those who love and support her on the sea!

### Wandering Sentiments of Fellow Artists Soar

— A Collection

Laurel and Hardy Jest and Tease Each Other

Revealing Smiles Like Maitreya Buddha

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in order to raise funds for hygiene, invited artists to broadcast on the Sincere Broadcasting Station to broaden publicity. Yesterday, members Yuan Deng, Gu Keming, and Le Pinbao of the association came forward and hosted a reception at the Atlantic Western Restaurant, inviting dozens of people including Chen Gexin, Hong Yiling, Han Lan'gen, Liu Jiqun, Liu Ziyun, Zhang Shiyong, and Li Changjian. There were movie stars, storytelling leaders, comedy masters, and drama pioneers; in short, they were all people who made a living with their mouths. Usually, their solo performances on stage could attract the audience's attention, but on this day, they gathered together, jesting and teasing each other during the meal. Han Lan'gen and Yin Xiucen were known as the Chinese Laurel and Hardy. They sat together on this day, and Zhang Ye'er asked them why their body sizes were so different. Yin said that although Han was small, he had too many "export" locations, so it was no wonder that his income could not cover his expenses, and he was getting smaller and smaller. Han said that Yin was insatiable and could eat three servings of large dishes, not caring about the host's expenses, only knowing how to fill his stomach, so he was getting fatter and fatter. Zhang Ye'er collected the foreign candies from everyone's desserts and gave them to Han Lan'gen, saying that they were British goods called "English" (homophone to "Yin," meaning Yin), and eating them could nourish the body, so he should eat more to avoid becoming as thin as a rib. Zhu Yaoxiang and Hong Jingling did not know each other. After being introduced, Zhu said to Hong: "I have seen your esteemed face on the screen for a long time, so I am very familiar with it. I have admired you for a long time, and I am fortunate to see your true face today." Hong said to Zhu: "I often hear your esteemed voice on the radio, clear and pleasant, and I am also very familiar with it. Today I am fortunate to hear your grand discourse in person, which is even more pleasant than in the air. I am extremely happy." Yu said, "You two gentlemen have never met before, one has seen the image, and the other has only heard the voice, but both have admired each other's great names for a long time. It can be called 'the sound and appearance are still there.'" Everyone laughed. He Shuangdai has recently invented light bulbs and is trying to promote them. Han Lan'gen said that he is currently filming a "Landlord" movie. Yu then said, "Landlord holds a light bulb and speaks to the three tenants, you, if you give me a dozen, then I will tell the three tenants, 'Shuangdai light bulbs use the least electricity,' otherwise, I will tell them 'Shuangdai light bulbs use a lot of electricity.' One word makes a huge difference in praise and disparagement." Everyone admired his ability to "extort money." There were many jokes during the meal, but due to space limitations, they cannot be described in detail. In short, during these two hours, dozens of people were all very happy, and everyone's face was like that of Maitreya Buddha. If it were captured on film, it would be a complete comedy.

### The Old Site of the Summer Peacock to be Rebuilt as a New Type of Cinema

— New Shadow

In the history of Shanghai cinema, the Summer Peacock Grand Theater at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road can be considered very old. It is said to be the first to show sound films. But for some unknown reason, after sound films became popular, the theater's business became increasingly sluggish under the competition of its peers, eventually declining and shutting down for seven or eight years.

After "August 13th," countless refugees poured into the concessions, and all the empty houses were occupied. The Summer Peacock Grand Theater was also used as a shelter. Until recently, the refugees were moved out, and the entire building is undergoing major renovations, even the facade above the entrance has been removed. After the theater is renovated, it will regain its glory and reopen. However, whether the name will be changed is still uncertain. Perhaps because after the "Isolated Island" experienced crowding problems, entertainment became a big moneymaker, and many new cinemas emerged. Therefore, the Summer Peacock, which had been closed for many years, is now back in the news, and making a profit is certainly a sure thing.

Another report, the Summer Peacock Grand Theater is now being rebuilt by the Far East Company, planning to build a new type of cinema, screening first-run Western films, with seating for 1,200 people. According to the foreign architect in charge of building the theater, the new theater will strive for modernization, paying special attention to the design of the seats to ensure that the audience is comfortable and satisfied, and it is expected to be completed in mid-October.

### Integrating Summer Cooling and Entertainment: Cangzhou Sets Up an Open-Air Cinema

— Pepe

Open-air cinemas have a long history in Shanghai. The former Dahua and Garden have become relics. The original site of the Dahua Hotel is now a flat land, and the original site of the Garden has been converted into a children's park by the Public Works Department. The only surviving one is the Cangzhou Open-Air Cinema. The lush green grass and the spacious site have left a deep impression on the minds of old Shanghai residents. This time, it has been reorganized and rebuilt into the most ideal summer cooling resort in the sweltering surroundings. The selected films are produced by the American 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., and Paramount companies. It is said that the selection of films is very strict, and they are all super-special or excellent works. In the residential area of West Shanghai, an open-air cinema that suits the season is indeed very urgently needed, and the person in charge of operating this venue also has a keen eye. It officially opened yesterday, and there were many visitors. Everyone believes that enjoying the cool and watching movies is a win-win situation, and it is a good place to spend a summer night. Two shows are screened every night; at 7:30 PM and 9:30 PM, and the seat prices are very affordable, only three or four dimes.

### Leisurely Sketches of the Art World

— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan

(8) Kunqu Opera

Zhu Yizun's "Jingzhiju Poetry Talk" says: "Liang Chenyu, Zi Bolong, from Kunshan, was skilled in lyrics and songs. At that time, Wei Liangfu, a local, had a beautiful voice. Bolong entrusted him with 'Washing Silk'." This is the origin of the Kunqu Opera style.

This thing once swept through the ranks, and the literati and officials competed for it. In recent years, the fashion of singing national styles has changed greatly. Local operas such as Yue opera, with their crude lyrics, have become popular; this style, however, has become old-fashioned and has been abandoned by the people of the time. The elegant and refined cannot compete with the vulgar and popular for money. This has been the case since ancient times, not just today!

### The Art of Ice Skating (72)

— Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen

Four-Sides Backward: Use the outside of the shoe to move backward, the body should lean back, not forward, the guest leg pushes forward, gradually moves to the back, the guest shoulder turns with it, and the line of sight follows the direction of movement. The most difficult and most important thing in outward retreat is that the start should be from a standing position, after the guest leg pushes, the leaving the ground should be gentle and not rushed, and it is strictly forbidden to form a hook shape behind the main foot, it is best to stand facing the circle you are about to complete, the center of gravity is on the guest foot, that is, the foot you want to push, the right foot moves forward, leaving six to eight inches, the toes point outward, the guest leg is greatly bent, the guest foot uses force to push on the inside, but it should not be rushed, it should follow the main foot. The longer the better.

When about one-third of the entire circle has passed, the shoulder begins to rotate, the guest shoulder is outside the circle, this kind of body rotation accounts for about half of the entire circle, the guest shoulder, arm, leg, and hip rotate with the head at the same time, until the whole body rotates to the position of the next idle step. Then, before the guest foot finishes pushing on the inside, it gradually rotates with the body, half pushing and half dragging behind the main foot, which can not only make the posture of the guest foot when leaving the ground elegant, but also make the side gain strength.

This kind of outward retreat starting method is difficult to learn, but once learned, it is fast and powerful, and can be relied upon. (The outward retreat circle is the fastest step for experts)

Second Step Starting Method: Before the end of a circle, the legs, arms, and head all rotate according to the method of movement. When the first circle is about to end, the swing back of the guest leg and guest shoulder can temporarily shift the weight of the whole body to the inner edge, while the main leg is straightened. This momentary position is exactly the same as the position at the beginning of the first circle. The end of the first step and the beginning of the second step are not interrupted, and the starting methods of the two steps are the same.

Another Starting Method: First place the main foot behind the guest foot, with the toes touching the ground, and then lift the main foot and move it forward. In this way, a lot of force can be borrowed, and it is easier to start. This method is often used by experts. However, when the main foot swings forward, the guest foot must not move an inch, otherwise it is a foul. The common problem for beginners in learning this step is that when the main foot is raised, it often pushes on the ground, causing the guest foot to move, thus violating the rule that the starting of the distant step must be from a standing position, so beginners should still learn the first method.

Furthermore, when the guest foot pushes and the body rotates, the direction of the eyes must first be aligned with the center of the circle, the longer the better, and then the head and guest half of the body should be rotated to the center of the venue. When the second step is about to start again, look at the center of the second circle again. This not only prevents loss of shape, but also makes it easy to pay attention to the direction of movement and avoid colliding with others. The above are the first and second styles of body position.

Although the third and fourth styles are used in advanced skating, it is also advisable to practice them at the same time. Use the third style after starting, the upper part of the body is opposite to the first style, because the guest leg stays in front, the guest shoulder and arm move back, advanced skating is often used in (A) before the backward loop knot, (B) after the outward progress reverse swing turn, and (C) before the outward retreat three-character turn.

The fourth style is the opposite of the second style above the waist, because the guest shoulder and arm are in front, and the guest leg is in the back. Advanced skating such as (A) before the outward retreat reverse swing turn. (B) before the outward retreat reverse three-character turn are all used. The above four styles of body position must all be practiced with the entire circle at the same time until learned.

### Midnight Drama Society Postpones Performance

The "Midnight Drama Society's" second practice performance, "Mrs. Zhang's Dream," written and directed by Wu Xiaobang, was originally scheduled to be performed tonight. Now, due to a ban from the Public Works Department, it has been decided to postpone it for a few days. Once the date is determined, a notice will be published in the newspaper. The previously sold tickets are all valid, please keep them.

### Summer Greetings

— Wan Yu

The semester ended in a torrent of plum rains that lasted for many days, and now, a long summer vacation of nearly two months will begin from this moment. For the past half year, your own academic performance and whether your parents are satisfied with your efforts in learning will be revealed in the report cards issued by the school. There is no way to avoid or conceal it.

Therefore, although it is now the holidays, in order to continue the spirit of past studies, or to remedy the defects that you have previously incurred in your studies, you cannot, and should not, squander the precious time during the two-month holiday. Of course, there is no need to quote the ancients' saying, "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time," to lecture you, but in fact, while you are still in the era of children who are striving for education, you must value time. Isn't it true? Although there is a tomorrow coming after today, the days seem to be endless; therefore, the idiom "the future is long" is not known to have harmed or delayed the studies and futures of many people! You must know that waiting for tomorrow is easy, but is it also easy to turn around and grab yesterday? It's very difficult, right? No, thinking carefully, it may make you afraid, scared, and even alert you to be more aware. Isn't it? The yesterday that cannot be grabbed back is the symbol of burying your childhood; while the tomorrow in anticipation is the ladder to welcome your old age. The passage of time is so rapid, the giant wheel of days is eternally advancing unnoticed by people. If you do not value time, and treat today with a diligent attitude, use today, grasp today, and cope with today; then the arrival of tomorrow will throw today into the ranks of yesterday, and in this conversion, you have suffered an incalculable loss.

As such, the purpose of school vacations is to give you an opportunity to rest, but you must not think that way. Two months, 1,440 hours, are you really going to spend it all in rest? No! You can't! If you are called an excellent student in school, and all your studies are outstanding, then you should take advantage of this holiday to work harder and accelerate your in-depth study, so that when the autumn semester starts, you will find that all your homework is easier to apply and easier to deal with than in the past. Otherwise, even if you are a poor student, it is not impossible to use this holiday to engage in tutoring and exploration, which can also help with your studies in the next semester. After all, humans are rational animals, and I think you certainly don't want to always fall behind others, so you must make extra preparations for your future academic prospects during this holiday.

Having said that, you must also pay attention to your physical health. The meaning of this is that during this vacation, I hope that you will take a few hours each day at an appropriate time to devote yourself to your studies, and then use the remaining time to cool off and rest, so that you can also recuperate your body and mind.

### Don't Let the Summer Vacation Pass By in Playing!

— Xin Liang

Children, since July 3rd, all schools have started their summer vacations according to regulations. Aren't we going to have that summer life again? In this two-month holiday, if you don't have a thorough summer plan and let those very precious moments slip away casually, it would be a real pity. The schools probably have "holiday assignments" issued to you, right? We must do these "assignments" diligently, and what needs special attention is that everyone must formulate a plan for how to spend the summer vacation, and don't waste time playing and having fun.

Some children think that it is not advisable to use too much brainpower in the hot weather of ninety-odd degrees. They also regard this long summer vacation as a time for rest. Therefore, they pay no attention to the topics of the various "holiday assignments" distributed to them by the school. Anyway, there is no teacher around to supervise you, so many children only know how to play all day and all night.

Some children, in the first day or two of the summer vacation, seem very happy about the topics given to them by the teacher. So they write large characters in the morning and large characters in the evening, and a copybook is finished in a day or two. But after the vacation has been going on for a while, they all show an unhappy attitude towards all subjects. Needless to say, the grades "rushed" out in this way will not be good.

In fact, both of these attitudes are undesirable! We should not only know how to play, nor should we do things "carelessly" in a rush. During the summer vacation, we should all set a plan for further study in our minds. For example, get up early in the morning, do morning exercises, write large and small characters, read books, and then go out to play for a while... Some children may be dissatisfied with a certain subject in which their grades are poor, then the summer vacation gives you the best opportunity to make up for it.

In short, dear children, you must make good use of these two long months of summer vacation, and don't let the whole summer vacation pass by in playing!

### Summer School in the Family

— Xixi

The weather is getting hotter day by day, and Lian'er's school has started the summer vacation.

Before the vacation, Lian'er's older brother thought that during this long holiday, his naughty younger brother would spend the whole day eating and playing, wasting these precious times. It would be a pity. Therefore, he designed a very complete tutoring plan for his younger brother, and his younger brother happily agreed. But after the summer vacation had started for several days, Lian'er had already put the matter of reading and writing out of his mind.

His older brother repeatedly urged him, but he just smiled foolishly. His older sister even took a book and asked him to read, repeatedly persuading him: "If you study, you will have food to eat in the future, otherwise, you will become a beggar." But his stubborn temper was not effective no matter what words were used to persuade or deceive him. Sometimes his older brother would beat him, and he would also resist. If he lost, he would cry loudly, causing his mother to intervene. Because he was young, he eventually won and continued to play with his toys. They couldn't think of an effective way to make him study.

One day, Lian'er's school sent his report card. His grades were average, but he still passed. Attached was a brochure for summer school. Because his brother knew of his stubborn temper, he said to him in a tone that was soft but firm: "Your grades are not very good, and you are still unwilling to study hard during the summer vacation. Your school is holding summer school. I think you are unwilling to study at home, so you should go to summer school. Which method do you like?" As soon as Lian'er heard that he had to go to school, he felt a headache. He quickly said: "Okay, I don't want to go to school for tutoring, I'll review at home." "That's fine, but you must follow the regulations we set. Otherwise, I'll ask Dad to send you to summer school."

So the five siblings (Lian'er was the youngest) all complied with the regulations they had jointly established.

(1) This school is named "Family Summer School."

(2) This school invites Dad as the principal and Mom as the vice-principal.

(3) This school adopts a joint supervision system.

(4) This school's class time: 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM every day, with no holidays except Sundays.

(5) This school's curriculum is determined by each person, but Lian'er must study Chinese, English, arithmetic, and general knowledge, and must submit one large and one small calligraphy paper every day. Chinese and arithmetic are taught by Ying'er (Lian'er's older brother), and English and general knowledge are taught by Ning'er (Lian'er's older sister).

(6) This school's term is from today until the day before each person's school starts.

(7) This school does not charge any fees and does not recruit new students.

(8) Students of this school who are playful and do not study will be punished by being suspended from eating lunch once.

(9) Students of this school are also directors of the school. If these regulations need to be amended, they will be amended by a resolution of the board of directors meeting.

### Several Things to Pay Attention to During the Summer Vacation

— Gao Ge

Time passes so easily, and it's the summer vacation again. Children, the two-month long summer vacation is when your teachers give you some summer homework, or your loving parents teach you to do some beneficial things during the summer vacation. Regarding how to use the summer vacation, I believe you all have good plans, so I won't mention this point again.

Children! There are several things that you are most likely to violate during the summer vacation. I will write them down now to serve as a warning to you.

Go to public places less! Summer is the season when mosquitoes and flies come out to carry out their activities on a large scale. They are the medium for spreading diseases and can bring germs to us. Especially in this hot summer, it is the best opportunity for them to spread. Therefore, people in general get terrible diseases in the summer. If we go to public places in the summer, others' terrible diseases will immediately be transmitted to us, which is very dangerous. Therefore, I advise all of you children to go to public places less during the summer vacation.

Eat less cold food: Summer is simply a world of cold food, ice cream, shaved ice, sour plum soup... etc. are all available. Many of them are of course well disinfected, but many can be said to be very unhygienic. Children! Aren't you often too hot and eat cheap cold drinks regardless of everything? Children! This is absolutely not allowed. Not long ago, didn't the newspaper report that a child died from eating an unclean popsicle? Children! Think about it, this is such a dangerous thing!

Should get vaccinated: We Chinese have a bad habit, which is that we are unwilling to get vaccinated. On the road, we often see a group of people running away in a panic because they are afraid of getting vaccinated. When they see the people who are vaccinating coming, it is as if they are going to be beheaded. This kind of despicable habit will really be laughed at by foreigners.

Dear children! You are all educated people, so I believe you don't have this habit. We should not only be caught by the people who are vaccinating us to be vaccinated, but we should also take the initiative to get vaccinated. This is not a child's play, but a practical disease prevention work!

Children! I believe that some of you have already implemented the above three things, and I think that some of you have not. Those who have implemented them should not forget to continue to implement them, and those who have not implemented them should quickly go and implement them!

### Guess the Word from the Picture

— Yu Guobao

Children! It's been a long time since we met, I miss you very much. Has your school started its summer vacation? What do you play with at home? Games, lonely? I have a game for you to play now. Look at the four pictures I have tried to draw below. Please look at the things inside and the way they are placed, and then guess what word they form? I believe that if you use your brain a little, you will be able to guess it. On one hand, you can pass the time during your summer vacation, and on the other hand, you can help you remember how to write this word, so that you will never forget it!

### Graduation Ceremony

— Old Du

As he watched her earnest face gradually relax. This young brother allowed her some space, and she sat beside him, a bouquet of flowers resting on her lap.

I couldn't tear my gaze away from her sweet and pitiful face, noticing her gently whispering in his ear, and he lowered his head, memorizing each word carefully. Finally, she asked him if he remembered the phrases now, and he nodded, indicating that he had memorized them.

According to the program, a young man finished speaking. As the music played again, the brother was even more surprised to see her walk onto the stage, passing through the group of school board members, professors, and distinguished guests, and approaching the principal.

"Sir!" she said, bowing. "Could you please give my brother another chance, because he has now memorized it."

The principal stared at her for a while through his gold-rimmed glasses. Finally, he smiled and granted her request, and then the unsuccessful brother continued his speech.

The music played for a while and then stopped, with a brief announcement of Mr. ××, his topic being "Historical Contrasts."

The audience's expectations were realized. They sat quietly, also worried for the speaker who was nervous on stage. But fear not! The young hero had awakened! He overcame everything, achieved his determined goal, and wiped away his shame. A smile appeared on the tear-stained child's face. I closely observed the face that was giving the speech—the large eyes, parted lips, concentrating all his attention on his words, forgetting the listening audience, and his spirit was moved along with him.

The speech was over, and he fearlessly gained enthusiastic sympathy, breaking the wrong judgments. The noble audience madly praised him, and flowers were thrown up like a storm. She helped her brother wipe away his shame—that beautiful face, filled with high and joyful colors, this matter was permanently engraved in her heart.

### In the Realm of Beasts (8)

— Qingxin

Peng Qi looked around for a while and began to feel uneasy. He hurriedly opened his mouth and asked, "Where is the person in the moon!" The chattering titmouse rushed to answer, "He has gone somewhere else."

The crow asked, "Do you have anything to say against it? Caw, caw, caw, if you have the guts, dare to pluck my feathers?"

Peng Qi did not answer the crow's challenges, but thought to himself, "These things are very strange, never mind, I'll go ahead and take a look."

The black dog barked a few times, but still let him pass; the bee was still buzzing and flying non-stop, and the cat in the cradle was still swaying and sleeping sweetly.

Peng Qi thought to himself again, "If I could ride a horse forward, that would be faster than walking myself." Then he went to the grazing mare and asked if it could take him a few miles.

The mare coldly said, "Are you crazy? You should be taking me for a walk, how can you ask me to take you for a walk?" As she spoke, her nose seemed to grow longer and longer, and terrifying light seemed to shoot out of her eyes. Peng Qi was stunned, frightened, almost breathless; he quickly ran away as fast as he could, and he unknowingly went deeper into the realm of beasts.

Ah, this is truly a most beautiful place. The beasts here, in all shapes and forms, are even more numerous than in the zoo; and they are all free. They do not kill each other, nor do they have the behavior of the strong preying on the weak, because in the realm of beasts, there grows a very special kind of short grass everywhere, which everyone can eat and everyone can fill their bellies with.

They get along well with each other on a daily basis, and if there are any quarrels or immoral behaviors, the person in the moon would loudly shout, "Keep the rules! Keep the rules!" And everything would immediately quiet down, not even a sound.

All the beasts in this realm of beasts must not only keep the rules, but also have considerable politeness. As Peng Qi walked along, they came in groups to welcome him, each in its own way. The cats rubbed their legs against their heads, straightened their tails, like soldiers raising their guns. The dogs wagged their tails and barked softly, circling around him; only a French poodle sat still throughout, seemingly expressing its elegance and politeness. The little crows were happily chirping or singing songs. The pigeons sat on his shoulders, making cooing sounds. Two swallows clung to the brim of his hat, twitching their tails, murmuring as if to greet him. A peacock walked in front of him, specially spreading its beautiful long tail; and a group of rose-colored parrots also gathered behind to show their welcome. After a while, a solemn and intelligent old elephant came to Peng Qi and knelt down, Peng Qi happily climbed onto its back, and it carried him forward, with the rest of the beasts following behind.

### Further Record of the Dragon in Nanhui

The dragon that passed over Nanhui City was more than fifty feet long, with its thickest part resembling a household water storage vat. It was as white as a bolt of silk, and its entire body was visible, with no cloud accompanying it. However, its body was enveloped in a hazy white mist, like a naked person clothed in gauze, making it impossible to see the scales clearly. Yet, the sunlight shining upon it made it appear as white as silver, which was indeed the dragon's scales. Its head was wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, as large as a seven-stone vat. Because of the encircling white mist, its horns were not visible, but roughly its shape resembled the head of a cow or horse. Its four feet were all on the front half of its body, very close together, quite different from the depictions by worldly painters. Its four feet were each more than three feet long. The claws were blurred and indistinguishable. The neck and head were both slightly thin, while the abdomen was particularly thick. The neck was estimated to be ten feet long, the abdomen twenty feet, and the tail more than thirty feet. The four feet were located at the thick part of the neck and below the abdomen, so it is known that everything beyond the hind feet belonged to the dragon's tail, and the tail was the longest part. Its tail resembled an eel, round and wide when viewed head-on, and thin and pointed when viewed from the side, sometimes pointed and sometimes round, without a fixed shape. Snakes move in curves, one left and one right; but dragons move in curves, one up and one down. The dragon-spine walls in Shanghai are also round, which can be said to be very similar. When the dragon was lowest outside the city, its tail hung down, about ten feet from the ground. Entering the city, its tail was level and did not hang down, about forty to fifty feet from the ground. Leaving the city, it lowered again to about ten feet. When it first left the city, its movement was still slow, but suddenly a patch of dark clouds came flying from the southeast. The dragon obtained these clouds, and its movement became faster. The further away it got, the higher it went, and in an instant, its tail was suspended in the clouds to the southeast. At this time, the clouds to the southeast formed a dragon frame, suspending five dragon tails, which then merged into six, all dark black in color. Only then did people realize that the previous whiteness was due to sunlight shining on it, appearing white up close and black from afar. No people or animals were harmed, but several roof tiles and one thatched roof outside the north gate were torn off. One corner of a house and one large tree inside the city were damaged. Several thatched roofs were damaged outside the east gate. A total of twenty or thirty roofs were damaged. When the objects were torn off, people only saw them flying up, but did not see where they landed.
