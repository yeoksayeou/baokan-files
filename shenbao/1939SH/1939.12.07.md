Editorial

### The Only Hope for Maintaining People's Livelihood

Ever since rice prices soared, there was hope that the new harvest would bring them down slightly, but instead, they have continued to rise, reaching a new high of forty-five yuan the other day. At the same time, the price of soybean oil has reached over one hundred and ten yuan per dan, and flour prices have reached eight yuan. The prices of other daily necessities are also rising in the same way. One price increase leads to a hundred, and the actual purchasing power of one yuan of legal tender today is probably less than 35% of what it was before the war. Although Shanghai is known as a prosperous city, the majority of its residents are wage earners who must meet unlimited expenses with limited income. Almost everyone is struggling, and their complaints are frequent. The situation is even worse for the unemployed and displaced people. They have no way to beg for food and no way to make a living. Exposed to the wind and frost, they are driven to take risks. Hunger and cold give rise to thieving hearts, which must be punished by law, but are still deserving of sympathy.

At the beginning of the war in Shanghai, rice prices rose from twelve or thirteen yuan to seventeen or eighteen yuan, causing widespread unrest and repeated incidents of rice grabbing. Finally, with the cooperation of various parties, a Rice and Grain Adjustment Committee was organized, and the Shanghai Municipal Council stepped forward to order a large amount of foreign rice, which was successively shipped to Shanghai to provide relief. This stabilized rice prices and benefited the people's livelihood. However, this arrangement collapsed during the lean months of this year. At that time, the Shanghai Municipal Council also tried to impose restrictions, but unscrupulous merchants and hoarders did their best to undermine these efforts, and the Municipal Council was unable to take further action. As a result, once price controls were broken, the situation was like a river overflowing its banks and became impossible to control. In May of this year, this newspaper pointed out that if price controls were necessary, it was important to determine how to implement them effectively; if they were not necessary, it was important to ensure that rice prices were not manipulated and remained stable. We also believed that turbulent times breed speculation, and that in order to minimize speculation in the rice market, open evaluation, centralized buying and selling, and equitable distribution were indispensable. However, these suggestions were ignored by the leading figures of the time, resulting in today's rice market being almost entirely controlled by hoarders and speculators. Now that grain prices have risen to unprecedented levels and the people are extremely uneasy, although condemnations and appeals are frequently heard, they are insufficient to curb the arrogance of unscrupulous merchants because they lack real power to restrain them. If things continue in this way, where will it all end? Therefore, we cannot help but pin our hopes on the Shanghai Municipal Council, which is responsible for protecting the citizens and maintaining public order. We urge the council to uphold its original intention of maintaining the people's livelihood, and to make the same efforts as it did after the outbreak of the war in Shanghai. We urge the council to cooperate with local public organizations, formulate concrete plans, take effective measures, work hard without complaint, overcome personal considerations, and stabilize the people's livelihood, acting as a life raft for millions of citizens.

Some argue that based on the situation in various aspects, stabilizing rice prices is difficult. This is certainly true, but the only real problem is a lack of determination to maintain the people's livelihood. If there is such determination, then the task will become easier. The reason why rice prices in Shanghai are so high is that the supply channels are blocked, allowing hoarders and speculators to take advantage of the situation. Once they have hoarded rice, they will inevitably seek to profit from it, and so they use their financial resources to exaggerate their position, secretly buying and selling to drive up prices, just like bamboo shoots breaking through the ground, rising step by step. There are many reasons for the disruption of supply channels, both internal and external, which cannot be fully explained in a few words. The problem of the people's livelihood is a factual problem. Addressing it by dealing with the facts and formulating appropriate strategies is difficult to do without a deep understanding of the root causes. One still runs the risk of being ridiculed for blindly following conventional methods. It cannot be judged based on conjecture, nor can it be measured by unsound and unrealistic statistics. Exaggerated talk will not have the effect of saving the situation. It is essential to approach the situation with a compassionate heart and develop a plan that addresses the specific symptoms. The most urgent issue to resolve is how to ensure that the supply of food to Shanghai is not hindered. There is no other way to do this than for the Shanghai Municipal Council to consult with the consular corps to make serious representations to the Japanese side, so that in the future, all rice and grain transported from the interior to Shanghai, or any ships or vehicles registered by the Shanghai Municipal Council to transport rice and grain from the interior, will not be hindered or detained in any way. This will replenish Shanghai's food supply and maintain Shanghai's security, and this is the first measure.

Centralize rice and grain trading in one market. Recently, the rice industry has also recognized this and has repeatedly announced its intention to reorganize its business rules. However, the reality is that it has been unable to prevent off-market transactions, and brokers are manipulating the market in a way that is beyond control. The true nature of this situation is not fully known to outsiders, but it cannot be denied that the rice market has lost its power to control the situation. If buying and selling are not centralized, it is easier to manipulate the market and more difficult to supervise it. Therefore, if the rice industry itself lacks the power to implement its business rules, then in times of emergency, the Shanghai Municipal Council should accept the rice industry's request and step in to assist. The council should send personnel to be stationed in the market on a permanent basis to supervise and guide it, preventing any transgressions. This is also the duty of those responsible for maintaining the people's livelihood in the area, and this is the second measure.

It is unnecessary to ask whether the manipulation and speculation of rice and grain are carried out by people within the industry or outside of it, since both are almost certainly involved. However, manipulation by those outside the industry cannot be successful without the assistance of those within it. In the current situation of severe hardship, is it humanly possible to use rice and grain, which are indispensable to people's daily lives, as a tool for manipulation and enrichment? The reason why hoarders dare to act so unscrupulously is that they are not warned. If those who are willing to confess are selected and exposed to the public, then hoarders will know to be more cautious and will naturally not dare to manipulate the market excessively. This will ensure that rice arrives every day and meets the needs of the citizens. Even if the quantity is small, it will not lead to today's high rice prices. However, the limited supply is used to satisfy the insatiable demands of hoarders, resulting in a shortfall in the daily food needs of the people. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Council should come forward to conduct a thorough investigation into the names of hoarders, the locations where they are hoarding rice, and the quantities they are hoarding. First, the council should send them letters of warning. If they persist in their wrongdoing, the council can invoke criminal law to prosecute them for obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce, which is preferable. Otherwise, the council can impose fines or confiscate the rice they have hoarded to meet the needs of the people's livelihood, and this is the third measure.

However, in order to stabilize rice prices, political power is needed, but power is sometimes constrained by the facts and cannot be fully exerted. This newspaper has argued that the problem is not so much a lack of rice as it is the difficulty of regulating it. This is even more credible in light of the current situation. At that time, a large amount of foreign exchange was already being spent on coarse grains, and there were concerns that spending even more on foreign rice would consume even more foreign exchange. Therefore, we did not strongly advocate buying foreign rice. Now that the new harvest season has arrived, it is still difficult to achieve the effect of regulation, which has further encouraged hoarding. The only option is to order foreign rice to meet market demand, which may seem like drinking poison to quench thirst, but can deter unscrupulous merchants. If this gradually stabilizes rice prices, then speculation will also decrease, and the need for foreign rice will naturally decrease. This will not have a significant impact on foreign exchange. On one hand, major companies and factories should be encouraged to provide their employees with advances to pre-purchase foreign rice, which they can then resell to their employees at cost, alleviating their hardship. On the other hand, the government should organize the sale of rice at affordable prices to meet the needs of the poor, and this is the fourth measure.

These four points only outline the general principles. As for how to manage the people's livelihood, stabilize grain prices, and address the daily necessities of life, measures should be taken based on the facts. These issues are beyond the scope of this article. The people of Shanghai have suffered from the hardships of life for a long time. The Shanghai Municipal Council is the only one who can relieve them of their suffering, and they are hoping for it as much as people hope for rain during a severe drought. We hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council will respect public opinion, consider the wishes of the people, and live up to the expectations of millions of citizens. The benefits of good governance will not be limited to the prosperous areas.

### The U.S. Recognition of the Soviet Union Becomes a Focal Point of Political Strife: The Republican Party Takes the Severance of Relations with the Soviet Union as its Platform; Finland's Overdue Loan is Placed in the Deferred Payment Account

Washington – Political figures here recently stated that since the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, pressure has been exerted on the government from all sides to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and rescind recognition (the U.S. recognized the Soviet Union in 1933). This matter has become a subject of debate in domestic politics. Leading figures of the Republican Party, such as former President Hoover and Senator Vandenberg, have repeatedly stated that the Soviet Union has violated its promises and engaged in communist propaganda within the United States. General discourse within the party also suggests that President Roosevelt's actions in recognizing the Soviet Union were a major mistake, and the predicament the U.S. finds itself in regarding the Finnish issue should be the responsibility of President Roosevelt. However, diplomatic figures argue that after the U.S. established relations with the Soviet Union, it could obtain useful intelligence from that country and, when circumstances permitted, contribute to peace efforts. Moreover, the Soviet Union's violation of international law and abuse of force are similar to Germany's, and since the U.S. government treats both Germany and the Soviet Union equally, it would be inappropriate to sever relations with the Soviet Union alone. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Washington – Observers here are paying close attention to the political problems caused by President Roosevelt's recognition of the Soviet government within the U.S. Republican Senator from Michigan, and Republican presidential candidate for 1940, Vandenberg, yesterday stated that "severing relations with Moscow" is one of the Republican Party's platforms, and the general movement of the U.S. Republican Party is also to recall the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, or sever U.S.-Soviet relations. Observers believe that the Republican Party sees President Roosevelt's recognition of the Soviet Union as the weakest point in the U.S. government's foreign policy. Vandenberg announced that President Roosevelt is personally responsible for the U.S. recognition of the Soviet government and requested an investigation into the "Roosevelt-Litvinov guarantee, which has become a comical translation." The guarantee he referred to was the document exchanged between President Roosevelt and Litvinov when the U.S. recognized the Soviet Union. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Washington – President Roosevelt recently instructed Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to place Finland's loan to the U.S., due on December 15, into the deferred payment account. The U.S. President announced this today while hosting a press conference, stating that when Congress reconvenes, he will recommend to Congress that this loan be returned to Finland to benefit the Finnish people. The overdue debts owed to the U.S. may also be handled in this manner. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Washington – There are widespread rumors that the U.S. government will allow Finland to defer its war debt payments. President Roosevelt made a statement to the press, saying that the Finnish authorities have not made any representations to our country regarding the principal and interest of the Finnish national war debt to the U.S. due on the 15th of this month. However, when the U.S. government receives it, it intends to automatically allocate it as a special fund to aid Finland. The detailed use of this special fund has not yet been determined, and it may be used to aid Finnish refugees fleeing abroad or to directly aid civilians in Finland, both of which are acceptable. In addition, the government will also ask Congress to consider the issue of Finland's war debt in order to assist that country, because I personally do not have the authority to allow Finland to defer its debt.

### Japan Re-Engages with Britain on the Blockade Issue: Ambassador Shigemitsu Visits the British Foreign Secretary

London – It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu Mamoru, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon to re-engage on the issue of Britain's blockade of German export trade, stating that a batch of German goods had already been ordered by Japan and is currently awaiting shipment to Japan, and this issue should be noted. Afterwards, Shigemitsu also visited Foreign Office official Butler for discussions. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Tokyo – The Miyako Shimbun carries the following statement by Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma regarding the British Cabinet order to intercept German exports on neutral ships at sea: "If Japanese ships in Europe suffer any losses, we are determined to take practical action in accordance with international law to deal with this situation. When British Foreign Office Butler replied to our protest, he stated that the British side would do its best to handle German goods being shipped to Japan. Butler's words are probably due to Britain's fear of Japan's determination. Do you want to ask why? Because Britain and France have considerable interests in East Asia, such as Hong Kong and Singapore. If Britain and France clash with Japan, they are like porcelain and are very easily shattered. It is not difficult to imagine the seriousness of the losses they will suffer, and the adjustment of British-Japanese relations, which Britain is currently working hard to achieve, will also be reduced to nothing. Therefore, as far as Japan is concerned, if Britain rigorously implements its Cabinet order, it will lose everything and gain nothing. In short, Japan has a firm determination on this violent act, and I believe that Japan's national strength can make Britain and France reconsider their attitude." Now, when Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma entertained reporters, he was asked about the above-mentioned statement carried by the Miyako Shimbun. Suma replied that last night, because he attended a banquet and returned home late at night, he saw a reporter and a photographer waiting at his residence. The reporter raised many questions about Britain's decision to intercept German goods on neutral ships. He then explained the British Cabinet order to the reporter in detail and expressed the hope that Central France would also consider this matter as important as Japan does. Unexpectedly, the reporter exaggerated his remarks excessively. A reporter asked whether he intended to correct this misunderstanding now. Suma replied that this matter was not serious enough to warrant correction. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### The Japanese Government's Attitude Towards the U.S. Softens: No Negotiations for a Commercial Treaty Have Been Proposed to the U.S. Yet; The U.S. State Department Considers the Grew Report

Washington – State Department officials yesterday studied the report of U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew to determine the basis for resolving U.S.-Japanese problems next day. Before studying the report, they could not comment. Although Grew did not discuss the negotiation of a new U.S.-Japanese commercial treaty when he met with Japanese Foreign Minister Kichisaburo Nomura on Monday, it is generally believed that Nomura has expressed Japan's willingness to respond to U.S. demands with a conciliatory attitude. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Washington – U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles met with reporters on the 5th on behalf of Secretary of State Hull and issued a statement on the meeting between Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura and U.S. Ambassador Grew to Japan on the 4th, stating that the State Department had received Ambassador Grew's report and was currently reviewing the specific conditions proposed by Japan. The Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that the talks were held in a constructive spirit, which is indeed the case. (Domei dispatch, 5th)

Tokyo – Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma claimed that the Japanese government did not regard the concentration of the U.S. fleet in the Pacific as an anti-Japanese threat. He said that when Japanese Foreign Minister Kichisaburo Nomura spoke with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew, Nomura did not mention the concentration of U.S. warships in the Pacific. Grew first explained U.S. public opinion towards Japan and the possibility of implementing a ban on the export of arms and raw materials to Japan. Nomura then explained the Japanese side's views on this. However, Nomura did not mention that the U.S. action was a threat to Japan. Suma claimed when answering reporters' questions that Japan "has not yet approached the United States to negotiate a provisional treaty to replace the 1911 U.S.-Japanese commercial treaty, which has been declared abolished by the United States.

Tokyo – According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, Foreign Minister Kichisaburo Nomura told cabinet advisors yesterday that from the perspective of the Grew-Nomura meeting held on Monday, the U.S. attitude towards Japan was slightly more constructive than before. Nomura requested the U.S. to acknowledge that China is in a state of war. The Miyako Shimbun and the Yomiuri Shimbun warned the U.S. not to force Japan into the arms of the Soviet Union. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Tokyo – The Miyako Shimbun, in an article on recent U.S.-Japanese talks, stated today: "We take this opportunity to frankly tell the U.S. government and people that the Japanese people, until recently, believed that the Soviet Union and Japan were incompatible and that no one believed that a U.S.-Japanese war was possible. However, recently, Japan's attitude towards the Soviet Union has greatly softened, while Japan's attitude towards the U.S. has become tougher. This is because the U.S. abolished the 1911 U.S.-Japanese commercial treaty, demanded a ban on fire and raw material exports to Japan, attempted to interfere in the "New Order in East Asia," and concentrated its fleet in the Pacific to threaten Japan. If the U.S. does not want to fight Japan, then the U.S. must reconsider its attitude towards Japan." (United Press dispatch, 6th)

### Canada Trains Air Force Personnel: Americans Allowed to Join the Service

Ottawa – The Department of National Defence has recently decided to allow American aircraft pilots to join the Canadian Air Force. Observers have commented that pilot training centers will soon be opened in Canada to train pilots for the British headquarters, the Australian Commonwealth, and the New Zealand dominion, numbering in the thousands. This decision by the Department of National Defence is likely intended to speed up the training process. The U.S. and Canada entered into an agreement several years ago allowing Americans to obtain federal commercial airline pilot diplomas. To date, hundreds of Americans have obtained this diploma. However, allowing them to join the Canadian Air Force is a first. From now on, American pilots will be able to fight alongside Canadian Air Force personnel on the European front lines, as they did during the last European war. This relationship is of great importance. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

### Soviet Troops Concentrated in Northern Finland Launch a Large-Scale Offensive: Bloody Battles Occur on the Karelian Isthmus; Soviet Navy Has Landed in the Gulf of Finland

Rome – According to a "Roman People's Daily" dispatch from Helsinki, Soviet troops have launched a large-scale offensive in the Karelian and Ladoga Lake regions. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Helsinki – Finnish troops near Petsamo and Salla are preparing to offer strong resistance to the anticipated Soviet attack. The war in the area is gradually intensifying. The Finnish side acknowledges that the Soviet troops have made some progress. The Soviet side is now sending troops along the road to the front line, but so far, the strength of the reinforcements is not enough to launch a frontal attack on the main Finnish positions. Refugees continue to cross the border into Norway, but no Finnish soldiers have entered Norway. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Moscow – Recent Soviet communiqués state that the Red Army has penetrated 15 to 29 miles deep into the Karelian Isthmus. From the phenomena observed, it seems that after five days of combat, the Soviet troops have only approached Finland's main Mannerheim Line. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Oslo – According to a dispatch from Kirkenes, near the Finnish-Norwegian border, Soviet warships carrying troops were seen landing on both sides of the port of Petsamo yesterday. The Finns did not stop them and seemed to intend to wait quietly in Petsamo for the Soviet troops to approach before attacking them. It is said that Petsamo has strong defensive fortifications. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Helsinki – Finnish official reports state that after three days of fighting on the Karelian Isthmus, Finnish troops captured 64 Soviet tanks. In one battle, 2,000 Soviet soldiers were killed. In the fierce battle of Salla, Finnish troops captured many prisoners. Out of ten Soviet tanks, eight were destroyed. According to the prisoners, the Soviet authorities told them, "Finland is an aggressor nation, and the Soviet Union only needs five or six days to conquer Finland." In the past few days, the Finnish side has suffered very little loss. Furthermore, according to local naval authorities, Soviet troops have occupied Tytärsaari Island, and Finnish troops have moved to the mainland. There has been no air combat between the two sides, but Finnish aircraft have been conducting reconnaissance flights and bombing enemy troops. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Moscow – According to a dispatch from Brussels today, Soviet naval infantry landed on Hogland Island in the Gulf of Finland yesterday. The landing troops were soldiers from mine-laying ships. Before the landing, Soviet warships bombarded the island first, released smoke screens, and then sent troops ashore. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

Finland – Finnish troops have launched an organized offensive against Soviet troops landing by parachute, and as a result, this Soviet attempt has failed. Today, a report was received here that Finnish troops used tanks for the first time and attacked Soviet tanks, destroying ten of them. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Helsinki – Soviet Red Army troops advancing towards northern Finland suddenly changed direction today and advanced towards the Swedish border. Their advance units have reached Kolajaervi, 25 kilometers from the Swedish border. They have suffered heavy losses along the way due to the valiant resistance of Finnish troops, including the loss of four machine guns and two field guns. The mechanized units have also suffered heavy losses, and many soldiers have died. It is also reported that on the Karelian Isthmus, Finnish troops have withdrawn from Suvanto. Soviet Red Army troops are now launching a full-scale attack on Suojaarvi. As for the Ladoga Lake area, Finnish troops have retreated from Salmi and Suulapelli after inflicting damage on the enemy. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Soviet Strategic Objectives: Cutting Off Finnish Troops' Communications

Helsinki – It is reported that the Soviet troops invading Finland are the 7th Army, commanded by General Meretskov, including eleven tank divisions, five of which are concentrated on the Karelian Isthmus and four of which are concentrated north of Lake Ladoga. According to observers, the main objective of the Soviet troops' offensive is to occupy the railway from Kemijärvi to the port of Ofotfjord in the Gulf of Bothnia. This railway also has a branch line to the port of Valaam in the southeast. This would allow them to control the Gulf of Bothnia and Lake Ladoga at the same time. However, so far, although the Soviet troops have crossed the Finnish border by 40 kilometers, they have suffered heavy losses. Swedish sources estimate that the Finnish forces have a total of 400,000 troops, while the Soviet 7th Army has no fewer than 500,000 troops. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Finland Notifies the League of Nations: Fortifications on the Åland Islands

Stockholm – According to reliable sources here, Finland has laid mines around the Åland Islands in accordance with the 1921 agreement guaranteeing the neutrality of the Åland Islands. The Finnish government is still in Helsinki. Responsible sources here believe that there is now no hope of a peaceful resolution to the Soviet-Finnish conflict. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Helsinki – After Finnish troops occupied the Åland Islands, they laid minefields around the islands. This was completed this afternoon. The Finnish side attaches great importance to the minefields. They believe that from now on, the Soviet Navy will no longer be able to enter the Gulf of Bothnia. Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner has formally notified the League of Nations of this matter. (Haitong dispatch, 5th)

### Finnish Aircraft Bomb Soviet Air Force Bases: Reports Claim 50 Soviet Aircraft Were Destroyed

Helsinki – It is reported that Finnish aircraft bombed a Soviet air force base in the port of Murmansk in northern Soviet Union, destroying approximately 50 aircraft. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Oslo – The Norwegian News Agency has received a message from Kirkenes, northern Finland, stating that three Soviet aircraft flew over the town of Kolosyoki in northern Finland today (a nickel mining company operated by Canadian businessmen is located in the town) and dropped bombs. Local anti-aircraft guns immediately opened fire. The town did not suffer significant damage. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Helsinki – The weather in northern Finland has now turned clear, and it is generally expected that Soviet aircraft will soon launch a major bombing campaign against Finnish cities. Yesterday, three Soviet aircraft bombed Salla, but they were driven away by Finnish anti-aircraft artillery, so Finnish losses were minimal. At the same time, one Soviet aircraft crashed about 20 miles away, and the fuselage was destroyed. In addition, Soviet aircraft are very active along the Finnish coast, and Soviet aircraft have even been seen in western Finland, near the Finnish-Norwegian border. The nickel-producing area of Finland has also been attacked by Soviet aircraft, but the damage is minimal. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

London – According to a report from Moscow Radio received here today, two Finnish aircraft flew over Leningrad at 9:00 a.m. this morning, attempting to drop bombs, but one of them was shot down by the Soviet side, and the other escaped under the pursuit of Soviet fighter jets. (United Press dispatch, 6th)

### Finland's Independence Day: Finnish President Delivers a Broadcast Address

London – Today is the 22nd anniversary of Finland's independence. Finnish President Kallio delivered a broadcast address, stating that our greatest strength is unity. The Finnish government has made every effort to find a solution through negotiations, but it cannot accept the terms proposed by the Soviet Union. Finland is now fighting to defend Western civilization. Kallio also expressed his admiration for the Finnish men and women who are bravely serving on the border. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Helsinki – Today is Finland's Independence Day. Ambassadors from various countries went to the Presidential Palace to offer their congratulations. The Cabinet and the Parliament held separate meetings yesterday evening to decide on various measures to ensure that various key agencies, especially transportation and food management agencies, continue to work without interruption. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Helsinki – Today is Finland's Independence Day, but Finland is again at war with its age-old enemy, Russia, in order to preserve its independence. Logically, today should be Finland's happiest day, but the city is filled with soldiers in military uniform with serious expressions, and citizens are carrying gas masks, so there is no joyous atmosphere. People generally expect that if the weather turns clear, Soviet aircraft will often bomb the people of Helsinki. Helsinki originally had a population of 300,000, but as a result of large-scale evacuations in the past few days, it now has only 50,000 to 60,000 people. Most of the buildings here have not been bombproofed, but the glass windows have been boarded up and various defensive measures have been taken so that the damage will not spread after being hit. Many areas in the city have been designated as restricted areas, and civilians are not allowed to enter. At the same time, the people who remain here now carry gas masks with them. Most men wear leather boots, breeches, and military-style clothing. Women are still working in shops, hotels, and restaurants, but their numbers have been greatly reduced. It is extremely difficult to evacuate the elderly here. When these people encounter officials who are evacuating, the elderly often say, "I am old, and you are young. You can go, but I would rather stay here." (United Press dispatch, 6th)

### 50 Italian Aircraft Arrive in Finland

Stockholm – According to reports received here today, 50 Italian aircraft have flown to Finland. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Rome – Several university students here recently shouted "Down with the Soviet Union" in front of the Finnish Embassy and then went to the Soviet Embassy to hold a demonstration. They were immediately dispersed by the police. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

### Germany Does Not Intend to Interfere in the Soviet-Finnish War: Soviet Diplomats in Germany Are Recalled to Moscow

Berlin – Diplomatic whispers state Germany's intention not to interfere in the Soviet-Finnish war, saying, "Germany and the Soviet Union have re-established friendly relations, so Germany does not intend to interfere in areas where the Soviet Union has decided to secure its long-standing interests related to its survival." (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

Danzig – According to a message from Berlin received here, regarding the Soviet Union's recall of three diplomats stationed in Germany, it is generally expected that there will be important political talks between the Soviet Union and Germany in the near future. (Haitong

Amsterdam – A dispatch received here states that Ivanov, the first secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Berlin, and two other embassy staff members, were suddenly recalled to Moscow. The reason for this move has not been disclosed, but this incident occurred at a time when Germany is eager for its relations with the Soviet Union to be formally harmonious, so people in Berlin are making many speculations about it. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)

Danzig – A dispatch from Berlin carried in the local political news reports states that people in Berlin expect that Germany may not recognize the Finnish People's Government established in Terijoki, but will continue to recognize the Helsinki government. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### League of Nations Meeting Approaching: Discussion of the Soviet-Finnish Dispute; Litvinov's Definition of Aggression; Finnish Representatives Prepare to Read it Aloud; Britain to be Represented by Butler

Geneva – Well-informed sources here recently stated that when the League of Nations General Assembly convenes on the 12th of this month, the Finnish representatives will read out the proposal made by the former Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, at the Disarmament Conference in 1933. According to this proposal, a strict definition of an aggressor is given, namely, any country that engages in one of the following acts shall be regarded as an aggressor: (1) declaring war on another country; (2) invading the territory of another country by force without declaring war; (3) attacking the ships or aircraft of another country by force without declaring war; (4) blockading the coast or ports of another country with warships; (5) any country that harbors armed elements from another country within its borders and supports them in attacking the territory of another country. In addition, the proposal states, "No reason, whether political, economic, military, or otherwise, may be used as an excuse for aggression." (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Geneva – The Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to meet on the 9th of this month, and the General Assembly is scheduled to convene on the 12th of this month. League of Nations officials have been speculating on the procedures that the Council and the Assembly may adopt. It is generally believed that the Council, at its first meeting, will formally record the application submitted by the Finnish government and then transfer it to the Assembly for handling. At the Assembly meeting, the Finnish representative will make a statement explaining that the actions taken by Finland are fully justified. Due to the absence of the Soviet representative, it is expected that the Assembly debate will not be too long and will conclude with the passage of a resolution or a proposal. No other actions are expected. Regarding the expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League of Nations under Article 16 of the Covenant, the Council has the power to do so, but it requires a unanimous vote from all member states, except for the party being condemned, i.e., the Soviet Union. However, Latvia is also a member of the Council this year, and since its military locations are under the control of Soviet troops, it would be difficult for it to vote to condemn the Soviet Union, let alone declare the Soviet Union's expulsion. There are two possible solutions: one is for the Latvian representative to abstain from voting, and the other is for the League of Nations General Assembly to convene before the Council's first meeting to hold elections for the non-permanent members of the Council, so that none of the Baltic Sea countries serve as council members. Only in this way is it possible. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

London – Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that when the Council of the League of Nations meets on the 9th of this month, Britain will be represented by Foreign Secretary Butler as the chief representative. Butler will publicly explain Britain's position on the Finnish conflict, and the application submitted by Finland to the League of Nations was initiated by Finland itself. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

London – Diplomatic circles here recently stated that when the Council of the League of Nations meets on the 9th of this month, the British representative, Foreign Secretary Butler, will deliver a speech expressing sympathy for Finland's plight. Regarding the expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League of Nations under Article 16, if the other members of the Council agree, Britain will also vote in favor. In 1935, when Italy invaded Abyssinia, the Council did not adopt this approach but only imposed sanctions. At this point, certain important figures in Britain no longer support the idea of sanctions, because Britain and France are now "the number one opponents of aggressors" and are prepared to fight to the end. It would be inappropriate for them to act as "police" for the whole world and engage in hostile actions against another aggressor. However, it would be different if Britain and France were certain that other countries would also join the war. As for Germany, Britain and France would welcome it if they went to war with the Soviet Union. However, the primary task for the Allied powers of Britain and France is to defeat "the number one aggressor." Even if certain parties use the crisis of overthrowing Bolshevism as an argument, it would be difficult to persuade Britain and France to abandon this task. However, if the following three conditions are met: (1) if Germany is also willing to cooperate in action to punish the Soviet Union, and not just condemn it verbally; (2) if Germany and the Soviet Union further threaten the entire Scandinavian Peninsula; (3) if the threat of Germany and the Soviet Union to the Balkans becomes a reality, then Britain and France will undoubtedly reconsider their current attitude. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Italy's Withdrawal from the League of Nations to Take Effect on the 11th of this Month

Rome – According to responsible sources, Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations will take effect on December 11, as this is the date when the notification period for Italy's withdrawal expires. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### British Foreign Secretary Reaffirms War Aims: Seeking to Establish a New Order in Europe; Peace and Amity Possible Only When Germany Regains Trust; Soviet Invasion of Finland is a Direct Consequence of German Policy

London – In response to the debate in the House of Commons last night regarding Britain's war aims, British Foreign Secretary Halifax explained the necessary principles for a satisfactory and lasting peace. The Foreign Secretary reiterated the declarations made by the government, opposition parties, dominions, and France, stating that, in essence, what we need is: 1. the restoration of freedom to peoples deprived of their independence; 2. to ensure that the people of Europe are no longer in constant fear of German aggression; 3. to safeguard our own freedom and security. It can now be said without a doubt that we do not seek to expand our territory or alter the map for our own benefit. Furthermore, we harbor no intention of revenge. On the contrary, our aim is to establish a settlement that encourages Germany to enjoy its rightful place in Europe, provided that Germany can regain the trust it has destroyed. We wish to create an international order in which the people of all countries can live peacefully under the rule of law, with political and economic life that is stable. We are willing to fully cooperate with others in political and economic reconstruction. We firmly believe that only in this way can we maintain an orderly international life in Europe. I sincerely hope that the sacrifices of this war will enable people to gain a correct understanding of Christian values. As for the practical conditions under which Britain is willing to cease hostilities, His Majesty the King recently stated in his reply to the peace proposals of the Belgian and Dutch monarchs that the King and his government do not wish to see the war prolonged for a single day longer than necessary. French Premier Daladier also stated a few days ago that if there is a government in Germany that can respect its signature, France is willing to negotiate peace with it. France is of the same mind, as is Britain. Some people are now suggesting a truce and the convening of a conference. It should be understood that those who participate in the conference must first learn the lesson that resorting to arms is not a better strategy than in the past. Only then can we expect the conference to achieve any results. Otherwise, it would be futile to merely indulge in ideals. There is no clear evidence that Germany has yet learned this lesson. There are two necessary prerequisites for convening a conference: 1. there must be evidence that the German government is willing to accept conditions that are consistent with our war aims; 2. there must be guarantees that any settlement reached at the conference will be respected. Otherwise, the conference will not be able to achieve anything and will only allow German leaders to deceive their people and perpetuate the belief that the old method of using force has not failed. If that is the case, then the key point of demonstrating the failure of aggression will not have been achieved, and the world will again be in a state of intolerable danger, as it has been in recent years. Aggressive behavior has recently revived. We have already witnessed another inexcusable act: the bombing of undefended towns and the slaughter of innocent women and children, justified by the notion that a country with a population of four million harbors hostile intentions towards a country with a population of eighteen million. The British people are shocked by the Soviet Union's attack and admire the Finnish people's. When the Council of the League of Nations convenes, it will explain its position. In my view, the Soviet Union's attack on Finland is a direct consequence of German policy. Hitler believed that by compromising with the Soviet Union, he could obtain a free hand to attack Poland, and he unscrupulously exchanged the freedom of the people of the Baltic states, which did not belong to him. The consequences of this have shown that once the floodgates are opened, disaster will follow. I believe that the British government's previous decision not to agree to an agreement with the Soviet Union based on the principle of indirect aggression against the Baltic states has now been proven correct by the facts, as this plan was merely a cover for its ultimate plans. I know that the British people would rather face hardship than compromise on such matters and damage the overall honor of the British Empire. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### British Official Announcement: Naval Losses Suffered; Nine Warships Lost in Three Months; Allied Fleet Holds Absolute Superiority; Thirty to Forty German Submarines Sunk

London – The official announcement of British naval losses in the first three months of the war, compared to the same period in the previous World War, shows that the tonnage lost is slightly more than half of that in 1914, while the number of ships lost is less than half. From August 4 to November 4, 1914, the British Navy lost 22 warships, totaling 125,600 tons, including 5 cruisers and 1 aircraft carrier sunk by torpedoes, 1 battleship and 1 cruiser, and 8 other ships sunk by mines. In addition, 3 cruisers were sunk by German surface warships. From September 3 to December 3 of this year, the British Navy lost 9 warships, totaling 73,886 tons, including 2 older warships, namely the aircraft carrier "Courageous" and the battleship "Royal Oak," sunk by torpedoes, and 4 other ships sunk by mines. Today, the superiority of the Allied fleet is far greater than in 1914. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

London – According to reliable sources, since the outbreak of the war in Europe, the British and French have sunk at least 36 German submarines, or perhaps as many as 40. The exact number is uncertain because German submarines are sometimes severely damaged but not necessarily sunk, making it difficult to provide an accurate count. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

### Another British 10,000-Ton Ship Damaged by Mine; British Admiralty Has Not Announced

Amsterdam – The British "Economic Weekly" published an article yesterday reviewing naval losses in the past week, acknowledging that a British 10,000-ton cruiser was damaged by a mine in the Firth of Forth. The British Admiralty has not announced this news. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)

### Churchill Reports: Naval Situation

London – First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill today presented a report in the House of Commons on the naval situation in the first three months of the European war. He stated that the enemy's main attacks are now focused on the British Isles and the Royal Navy and maritime commerce upon which the Empire relies. Our country constantly has over two thousand ships sailing at sea. In British ports alone, the number of ships moving daily ranges from one hundred to one hundred and fifty. This vast transportation is being maintained despite constant submarine attacks. We are also frequently under aerial attack, and the enemy is conducting large-scale mine-laying operations to restrict us. Recently, magnetic mines have been placed in the sea by aircraft or submarines, violating maritime warfare regulations agreed upon by Germany and other countries. In addition, the enemy has two so-called pocket battleships and one cruiser causing trouble at sea. However, the British Admiralty is still able to maintain and protect the vast transportation of the world and is engaged in capturing German ships and goods of concern to Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### Three Nordic Countries United: Strictly Maintaining Neutrality; Sweden Lays Mines in Territorial Waters

Copenhagen – Danish Prime Minister Stauning delivered a speech in the Lower House yesterday afternoon, announcing the Danish government's attitude towards the Soviet-Finnish war. He stated that the Danish people are extremely concerned about Finland but will strictly maintain neutrality. He said that during the previous World War, the heads of state of the three Nordic countries held a meeting in Norway in 1917, and the three governments announced their determination to maintain friendly relations. In October of this year, the heads of state and foreign ministers of the Nordic countries reiterated this declaration at a meeting in the Swedish capital. The Danish Prime Minister continued, stating that the Danish people deeply believe that the policy of neutrality must be maintained, and the order regarding neutrality regulations of May 31, 1938, should apply to the Soviet-Finnish war. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)

Stockholm – In order to safeguard its national neutrality, the government recently decided to lay mines within its territorial waters in the Gulf of Bothnia (northern Baltic Sea). (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Stockholm – People from all walks of life in Sweden sympathize with Finland's unwarranted invasion. In addition to the Royal Family donating 26,000 kronor (Swedish currency) to the Red Cross for the purpose of rescuing Finnish wounded soldiers, donations from the business community and private individuals have reached a total of one million kronor, designated for purchasing clothing and weapons for volunteer soldiers. Finnish people seeking refuge in Sweden are universally welcomed by the local people. In addition, student and worker groups have been successively holding meetings in recent days, issuing declarations, pledging loyalty to the country, willing to sacrifice everything for the country, and sympathizing with Finland's war aims. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

### Sympathy for Finland Worldwide; Material Assistance Uninterrupted

London – Political figures here recently stated that the financial and material assistance that Finland has obtained from European countries, especially neutral countries, far exceeds what most people initially anticipated. This can be confirmed by reliable information received from the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, Italy, and other countries. At the same time, the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, under the dual threat of Germany and the Soviet Union, are constantly apprehensive and unsure which of the two will launch the first attack. It is only natural that these countries have even more sympathy for Finland's plight. In addition, the Finnish embassy here is receiving mountains of letters from various parts of Britain and other countries, expressing deep sympathy for Finland or enclosing checks to donate to the Finnish Red Cross, which shows that the people of Britain are extremely concerned about the situation in Finland. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Budapest – Premier Teleki stated in the House of Representatives, "Our country maintains friendly relations with Finland.

Santiago – It is reported that the Chilean government has rejected the proposal that the countries of North and South America should jointly declare a protest against the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland. The reasons for its rejection are: 1. Chile believes that the American countries should not interfere in events and conflicts on other continents; 2. such a protest is too late, as no similar action was taken when Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Albania were invaded. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

The King's trip took him deep into the front lines, and the last place he inspected the troops was a quarter of a mile from the barbed wire defenses. The King's car returned to headquarters in the twilight. At that time, some French civilians were standing by the roadside, waving to welcome him. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### American Countries Intensifying Naval Training; Key American Military and Political Figures Deliver Speeches; Trend Towards Collective Action in Military Affairs

Washington – US Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army Major General Embick recently gave a speech here on Pan-American issues. He said, "The American countries have not entered into an agreement to take collective action in military affairs. However, if a strong country invades one of the American republics and seeks to obtain a base in the Western Hemisphere, then the US Army will be prepared to provide assistance, regardless of which country the aggressor belongs to, because if the aggressor achieves its goals, then the American countries will have no security." Rear Admiral Nimitz, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation of the Navy, followed by speaking out in favor of intensifying the naval training of the American countries, "so that when the linked relations of these countries are threatened by external forces, they can jointly respond to it." The governments of Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia have all sent naval aircraft pilots to study at the US Pensacola Naval Air Station. The government of Chile is also scheduled to send personnel there to study next year. The US government has also sent naval delegations to Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Peru to assist these countries in training their navies. The Colombian government has also sent four officers to serve on US torpedo boats, which are currently patrolling the Atlantic Ocean. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Ministry of Education Investigates Guidance Work in Normal Schools

(Chongqing Airmail) In July of this year, the Ministry of Education announced measures for normal schools in various provinces and cities to guide local education, specifying in detail the target audience for guidance from the normal schools, the scope of guidance work, the tasks of guidance conferences and special discussion meetings, correspondence research, publication of journals, and the establishment of training courses. The Ministry of Education believes that normal schools bear the responsibility of guiding local education, and after these measures were promulgated, the provincial education departments have followed them. Therefore, an investigation should be conducted, and in early November, orders were issued to the provincial education departments to investigate the organizations, meetings, and situations of local education administrators guided by the normal schools in their respective provinces and report them in detail for verification, so as to observe the effectiveness of these measures.

In early November, the Ministry of Education ordered the provincial education departments to promptly formulate and submit for approval various measures related to the treatment of elementary school teachers within ten days of receiving the document.

中央藥物研究所　劃歸敎部管轄　便與各校取得聯擊

Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute to be Placed under the Jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education to Facilitate Contact with Various Schools

(Chongqing Airmail) The Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute, originally under the Ministry of Health of the Ministry of Interior, was established with the aim of researching national medicinal materials to promote and improve China's inherent culture. However, pharmaceutical research is deeply related to academics, and it is not easy for the institute, attached to the Ministry of Health, to establish contact with various schools and other research institutions. In view of this, the Ministry of Education consulted with the Ministry of Interior and submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan to transfer the institute to the Ministry of Education in order to research China's medicinal material resources, cultivate pharmaceutical talents, and promote China's inherent culture. It is reported that the proposal has been approved by the Executive Yuan.

滬市輔幣券缺乏　電財部迅予增發　由市商會銀錢業聯電請求　二批分幣券已定明日發行　工部局亦正研究

Shortage of Subsidiary Currency in Shanghai, Telegram Sent to Ministry of Finance Requesting Prompt Issuance; Joint Telegram from City Chamber of Commerce and Banking Industry; Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes Scheduled for Issuance Tomorrow; Shanghai Municipal Council Also Conducting Research

上海市商·銀行公會·錢業公會·等三　體會商救濟輔幣券缺乏恐慌後、昨已聯電財政部、請即速增發輔幣券、以應需要、中央銀行上海分行、準明日起發行第二批分幣券、第三批委託美商永ning公司承印、又工部局方面、亦密切注意此事、茲錄　情如下、聯電財部卽速增發二批分劵明日發行

After a joint consultation by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, and Money Trade Association to alleviate the panic caused by the shortage of subsidiary currency, a joint telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance yesterday requesting the prompt issuance of more subsidiary currency notes to meet the needs. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank is scheduled to issue the second batch of fractional currency notes starting tomorrow. The third batch has been entrusted to the American company Yongning for printing. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Council is also paying close attention to this matter. The details are recorded below.

市商會·銀錢業公會、於前日會商救濟上海輔幣券缺乏恐慌、當塲決定由三團體聯名、電請財政部即速增發、以應坱要逐步其原電略云、「本市一角兩角輔幣券、市上奇缺、零找買賣、極感不便、主即速增發、以應需要、該電業已於昨日由三團體蓋章發出、

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Money Trade Associations consulted the day before yesterday to alleviate the panic caused by the shortage of subsidiary currency in Shanghai. It was decided on the spot that the three organizations would jointly send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting prompt issuance to gradually meet the needs. The original telegram roughly stated, "One- and two-cent subsidiary currency notes are extremely scarce in the city, making small transactions very inconvenient. It is requested that they be issued promptly to meet the needs." The telegram was stamped and sent by the three organizations yesterday.

中央銀行上海分行、經總行轉呈財政部核准、續發分幣券五十萬元、業已由美商永ning公司印竣、凖明日起由該分行按市面需要、逐漸發行、各大公司商號以及各業同業公會、均已備函向訪分行申請、該分行因申請總額已逾五十萬元、故決定分別酌量核發、

The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, with the approval of the head office forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, will continue to issue 500,000 yuan of fractional currency notes, which have already been printed by the American company Yongning. The bank will gradually issue them starting tomorrow according to market needs. Major companies, firms, and industry associations have all prepared letters to apply to the branch. Because the total amount requested exceeds 500,000 yuan, the branch has decided to allocate the notes proportionally.

代價券已限期收回

Substitute Currency Notes to be Recalled by a Deadline

關於滬市各大公司商號前發之代價券沭市面者、為數頗　、聞財政部以該項代價券、事前未經核准、於　毫无根據、今中央銀行分幣券已發行、一·批五十萬元已定期　發、三批已委託永ning公司續印、以後已能啣接發兌、決無缺乏恐慌之虞、至各行號公司之代價劵、自應限期收回、聞已飭上海市商會輕快地飭各業、限期辦理、

Regarding the substitute currency notes previously issued by major companies and firms in Shanghai, the amount in circulation is quite large. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance believes that these substitute currency notes were not approved in advance and have no basis. Now that the Central Bank's fractional currency notes have been issued, the first batch of 500,000 yuan has been issued on schedule, and three batches have been entrusted to the Yongning Company for continued printing. In the future, issuance and exchange will be able to proceed smoothly, and there is no fear of a shortage panic. As for the substitute currency notes of various firms and companies, they should be recalled by a deadline. It is heard that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been instructed to order various industries to handle the matter by a deadline.

修正輔幣條例通過

Revised Subsidiary Currency Regulations Passed

新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、財政部自准中央银行发行分幣券後、前民国一十五年一月　一日公佈之辅幣条例、均繼續有效、並規定偽造輔弊及妨害輔幣信用者、依法懲　、

A reporter from Xin Sheng She learned from banking circles yesterday that after the Ministry of Finance approved the Central Bank's issuance of fractional currency notes, the Subsidiary Currency Regulations promulgated on January 1, 1926, remain in effect. It is also stipulated that those who counterfeit subsidiary currency or undermine the credit of subsidiary currency will be punished according to law.

三批已由永ning承印

Third Batch Being Printed by Yongning

第三批分弊裝券、　已由中央銀行港辦事處與永ning公司商妥、訂立承印合同、由永ning公司承印、聞決俟第二批五十萬元發行完竣後、即繼續發行三批、務使啣接不致中斷、關於三批分幣券之總額、聞亦為五十萬元、完全係五分券、因上海市塲　輔幣劵缺乏之後、需要五分劵代替行使正殷、

The third batch of fractional currency notes has been agreed upon by the Hong Kong office of the Central Bank and the Yongning Company, and a printing contract has been signed for Yongning Company to print the notes. It is heard that the third batch will be issued after the second batch of 500,000 yuan has been completely issued to ensure that the issuance continues without interruption. The total amount of the third batch of fractional currency notes is also said to be 500,000 yuan, entirely in five-cent notes, because after the shortage of subsidiary currency notes in the Shanghai market, there is a great need for five-cent notes to be used as a substitute.

工部局正研究考慮

Municipal Council Studying and Considering

英文大美晚報云、今（六日）可靠方面、公共租界工部局對於消除本市輔幣之缺乏、業已加以研究與考慮、但此項問題、困難甚多、而工部局發行特殊輔幣之可能性、甚為渺茫、蓋局方欲僱　在經騐之印刷工人與購買物料、以　輔幣、則將增多支出也、

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that today (the 6th), reliable sources say that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement has already begun studying and considering ways to eliminate the shortage of subsidiary currency in the city. However, this problem is very difficult, and the possibility of the council issuing special subsidiary currency is very slim. This is because if the council wants to hire experienced printing workers and purchase materials to print subsidiary currency, it will increase expenditures.

華方銀行職責所在

Responsibility Lies with Chinese Banks

工部局某員告記者稱、對於此事素無經騐者而擔　此項　務、頗　困難、且發行紙弊、乃中政府之工作、工部局若擔任此項事務、實　破壞主權云、據另一官員聲　、茲可使公衆確信者、工部局對於缺少輔弊、已加注意、但認此事為華方銀行職責之一部份、整個事件、僅係時間問題耳、中國今方遭遇許多困難、此即輔幣缺少、一時不致復原之故云、

A certain official of the Municipal Council told reporters that it is quite difficult for those without experience in this matter to undertake this task, and that issuing paper currency is the job of the Chinese government. If the Municipal Council were to undertake this task, it would undermine sovereignty. According to another official, the public can be assured that the Municipal Council has paid attention to the shortage of subsidiary currency, but recognizes that this matter is part of the responsibility of Chinese banks. The entire incident is only a matter of time. China is currently encountering many difficulties, which is why the shortage of subsidiary currency cannot be restored for the time being.

滬市商會亟應設法

Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Should Actively Seek Solutions

記者今晨又訪某高級官員、據稱、公衆欲求工部局解決此問題、乃必然之事、但工部局坱要增加若干收入、以應付製造輔弊耗費、此乃不可否認者、一九一四年法國貨幣短缺、結果　商會發行臨時紙幣、問題乃告解決、渠不解公衆何以盼望工部局擔任此微妙任務、熟悉上海　業活動與困難之本市商會、　能以更富經騐之方法、辦理此事、而消除現局之困難也云、

This morning, a reporter visited a senior official, who said that it is inevitable that the public wants the Municipal Council to solve this problem, but it is undeniable that the Municipal Council needs to increase some revenue to cope with the cost of manufacturing subsidiary currency. In 1914, France faced a currency shortage, and the problem was solved when the Chamber of Commerce issued temporary paper currency. He does not understand why the public expects the Municipal Council to undertake this delicate task. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which is familiar with Shanghai's business activities and difficulties, can handle this matter with more experience and eliminate the difficulties of the current situation.

交通機關續發代券

Transportation Agencies Continue to Issue Substitute Coupons

同時本市各處輔弊、仍感欠缺、電車與公共汽車之代價券、亦見缺乏、衆信電車公司不久將續發代價券、公共汽車公司目下所發之代用弊、不久亦將增加、

At the same time, there is still a shortage of subsidiary currency in various parts of the city, and there is also a lack of substitute coupons for trams and buses. It is believed that the tram company will soon issue more substitute coupons, and the substitute currency currently issued by the bus company will also be increased soon.

大通銀行運來法弊

Chase Bank Brings in French Currency

今晨九時盛謠、新輔弊已自香港載塔虎脫總統號輸運來、而於九時市過、即有六箱在海關碼頭起岸、運入大通銀行、但記者向大通銀行探悉、今晨自華南而運來者僅係該銀行不斷接獲之五元與十元法弊、

At 9:00 this morning, there were rumors that new subsidiary currency had been transported from Hong Kong on the President Taft and that at 9:00 AM, six boxes were unloaded at the customs wharf and transported to Chase Bank. However, reporters learned from Chase Bank that what was transported from South China this morning was only the bank's continuous receipt of five- and ten-yuan French currency notes.

又據社聞社消息、美國總統輸船公司之塔虎脫號輪、於昨日上午十時三十分由港抵滬、據悉該輪運有法弊四大箱、計値港弊二十六萬五千元、合國弊二百萬元、該項法弊、係由本埠大通銀行由港裝滬、

According to news from the news agency, the President Taft of the American President Lines arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong at 10:30 AM yesterday. It is reported that the ship carried four large boxes of French currency notes, valued at 265,000 Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to 2 million national currency. The French currency was shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai by the local Chase Bank.

當局將抑平米價　籌議法律制裁　已謢法律部商議　特一法院頗重視

Authorities to Suppress Rice Prices, Planning Legal Sanctions; Consulting with the Legal Department; Special First Court Attaches Great Importance

最的近滬市米價日趨　貴、公共租界工部局以問題間接將使社會秩序陷於危境、雖曾聯合米業團體、一再勸告、及設法防止、然迄無成效、工部局當局有　及此、以若無一種嚴萬制裁之方法、決不能使徒知牟利之輩、知所警惕而覺悟、爰飭該局法律部籌覔一適當制裁之辦法、該部奉令後、已由各律師會同商讓、並聞特一法院當局對此亦頗重視、現正與法律部會商採取嚴厲處置之有效方法、

Recently, rice prices in Shanghai have been rising, and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement believes that the problem will indirectly endanger social order. Although it has joined forces with rice industry groups, repeatedly advised, and tried to prevent it, it has not been effective. The authorities of the Municipal Council have realized this and believe that without a method of strict sanctions, it will not be possible to make those who only know how to profit aware and awakened. Therefore, the Legal Department of the Council has been ordered to find a suitable method of sanction. After receiving the order, the department has consulted with various lawyers, and it is heard that the authorities of the Special First Court also attach great importance to this and are currently consulting with the Legal Department to take effective methods of severe punishment.

Branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank in various regions of the country have now begun to handle the receipt of these debt donations. The Bank of China is also handling this matter in Hong Kong and overseas. The debt donation campaign has been launched in various places, and the people are motivated by patriotic enthusiasm to support the government in completing the national policy of resistance and reconstruction, and their contributions are enthusiastic.

十一月份市况變動　生活費雙趨上漲　月初承上月跌勢頗見下趨　月杪受滙率變動又忽上昇

Market Conditions Changed in November, Living Costs Tend to Rise, Continuing the Downward Trend of the Previous Month at the Beginning of the Month, Then Suddenly Rising Due to Exchange Rate Changes at the End of the Month

據工部局公報載、本市工人生活費指數、自十月份初見回降之後、本月又復上漲、總指數為二五四·五四、較上月份高六·三二點、計增百分之二·五五、貨弊購買力則二十五年度法弊一元、本月値三角九分二厘九毫、分類指數漲落互見、食物各漲百分之四·三六及二·〇五、衣着燃料微降百分之一·〇〇及一·六七〇、

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's gazette, the cost of living index for workers in this city has risen again this month after initially declining in October. The general index is 254.54, 6.32 points higher than last month, an increase of 2.55%. The purchasing power of currency is 39 cents, 2 mills and 9 haos for one yuan of legal tender in the 25th year. The classified indices show mixed trends, with food rising by 4.36% and 2.05%, respectively, and clothing and fuel slightly decreasing by 1.00% and 1.670%.

物價趨勢殊不一致

Price Trends Are Very Inconsistent

本月物價趨勢、殊不一致、月初承上月跌勢、頗見下趨、月秒則見上漲、米價及匯率之變動、實為主因、本月之始、米價下傾、　號粳米價在二十六元至　十八元之間、羊秈在二十二元至二十六元間、迨入下旬、產區大量採購出口、投機者操縱囤積、米價劇漲、二號粳米及羊秈均達三十四元左右、匯市初見鬆動、本月六日市價英匯為五便士半、美匯為九·一六六七元、二十五日起、又見緊縮、英匯最低達四便士七五、美匯達七·六八七五元、

Price trends this month are very inconsistent. At the beginning of the month, the downward trend of the previous month continued, but at the end of the month, prices rose. Changes in rice prices and exchange rates are the main reasons. At the beginning of this month, rice prices declined, with No. 2 japonica rice priced between 26 and 18 yuan, and yangxian rice between 22 and 26 yuan. In the last ten days of the month, large-scale purchases were made for export in the producing areas, and speculators manipulated and hoarded, causing rice prices to rise sharply. Both No. 2 japonica rice and yangxian rice reached around 34 yuan. The exchange market initially eased, with the market price of British exchange at five and a half pence and the US exchange at 9.1667 yuan on the 6th of this month. From the 25th, it tightened again, with the British exchange reaching a low of four and three-quarters pence and the US exchange reaching 7.6875 yuan.

Among food items, lard saw the sharpest increase. Fresh meat rose 14.60% compared to last month, preserved meat rose 4.89%, and lard rose 5.31%. The supply of goods decreased sharply, and market prices rose. Soybean oil increased by 14.40% due to a lack of supply and hoarding by speculators. Table salt increased by 7.64% due to increased tax rates. In the clothing category, printed cloth rose, while native cloth and fine cloth fell, offsetting each other, resulting in a stable trend. The weather suddenly turned cold, but the prices of winter goods did not increase. In the fuel category, coal briquettes decreased by 9.45% due to price competition among peers. Firewood and charcoal increased due to supply disruptions. In the miscellaneous category, grass paper rose by 7.45%, yellow wine rose 7.98%, and soap rose 3.08%.

滬西税收　正谋解决　工部局表示

West Shanghai Tax Collection Being Resolved; Municipal Council Expresses

Since the beginning of this month, tax collectors from the puppet municipal government's Finance Bureau, accompanied by armed puppet police, have been forcibly collecting house taxes from Chinese residents living in the areas beyond the boundaries of the International Settlement. Those who do not pay are subjected to threats and intimidation. For several days, the difficulties faced by Chinese residents in the area have been widely reported. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Feili Bo, Director-General and President of the Municipal Council, and asked whether the

### Wartime Europe March: Special London Correspondence: How We Understand the Attitude of the Soviet Union

— Shu Di

Originally, the Soviet Union operated on the principle of secret diplomacy. However, after the recent signing of the Soviet-German agreement, various propagandas, rumors, and deliberately fabricated falsehoods have further obscured the true direction of the Soviet Union, leaving everyone in a state of confusion.

Furthermore, because Germany fundamentally betrayed Japan, Japan felt that its future was in great danger, which is easily imaginable. Therefore, based on Japanese propaganda organs, all kinds of unfounded fabrications were naturally spread. These fabrications are occasionally seen here, but not often. Judging from the few recent instances, their general purpose, after deduction and analysis, is: using the "reddening" of China as a theme to incite British and American capitalists to stop aiding China and instead help Japan under the guise of "anti-communism." However, in another moment, they say that the Soviet Union "wants to redden" China, intending to alienate the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. But when this narrative shifts again, it becomes that Japan and the Soviet Union have reached an understanding, and Japan can "act freely in the Far East." This time, the intention is very obvious: to incite internal divisions within China. Consequently, it is said that a puppet show, orchestrated by the Japanese military and rogue elements, will take the stage during the opportunity of "internal disputes" in China. The current "Japanese-Soviet understanding" and "internal disputes in China" are simply the "stage setting" for this farcical drama.

Therefore, I want to start by saying that the three types of rumors mentioned above are all wild fantasies and nonsense, and have not had any effect here. On the contrary, as a propaganda tactic, they have become a joke, exposing the half-baked nature of the Japanese.

We must acknowledge the facts: Since the signing of the Soviet-German agreement, in these past twenty-plus days, the Soviet Union's diplomatic actions have indeed deviated from their usual course. Even the communist parties of Britain and France find it difficult to trace their origins and future developments. The French Communist Party has suffered an unprecedented major blow, experiencing internal divisions and facing dissolution by the government. In Britain, the government has not taken any special measures, but there are major disputes brewing within the British Communist Party. It is highly likely that the current Secretary-General, Pollitt, will be replaced. Although some writers from a third country and their writings unconditionally support the Soviet Union's actions, a reading of their words reveals their revulsion at the Soviet Union's recent moves and their inner anxieties, which are clearly evident on the page.

However, through all the rumors and shadows, at the deepest level, we can clearly see the trajectory and origins of the Soviet Union's attitude.

First, we must recognize one point: the Soviet Union's recent actions are entirely reactive. In my communication "New Developments in the International Situation," I also mentioned that the Soviet Union's intention is entirely defensive. The Soviet Union's actions in recent days have increasingly clarified its fundamental intentions.

The Soviet Union's agreement with Germany, under the current circumstances, objectively helps Germany's use of force against Poland, but in doing so, it also risked two significant dangers. One is the immediate danger: If Germany swiftly defeats Polish forces, Britain and France will find it difficult to defeat Germany and will continue to make concessions, leading to a "peace" agreement, followed by plotting an invasion of the Soviet Union under the banner of "anti-communism." This is a path that many reactionaries in Britain and France are currently advocating. What will happen after "peace" is achieved? At that time, Hitler will have truly reached the golden age of his life, able to play all sides, and using "anti-communism" as a slogan to threaten Britain and France to obtain supplies of raw materials and diplomatic non-interference. Under such circumstances, the dangerous positions of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France would be almost identical. There is also a more fundamental danger: As a famous communist leader said, "Any expansion of fascist forces in any region of the world directly or indirectly threatens the Soviet Union." Since Stalin's dictatorship, the Soviet Union's only central policy has been to use all possible methods and forces to develop, consolidate, and protect this sole socialist state. However, in this world dominated by capitalist imperialism, will the Soviet Union objectively consolidate the internal power and external influence of a reactionary totalitarian regime like Germany? Of course not! Then, does Stalin really believe Hitler's self-serving claims that Germany can be "reddened"? This is an even bigger joke!

The Soviet Union probably estimated that after the signing of the Soviet-German agreement, Poland's attitude towards Germany would suddenly soften, reaching a compromise with Germany, and that Germany would then turn its attention westward, directly towards Britain and France. This, for the Soviet Union, would probably be the ideal possible scenario. However, this possibility has already been completely eliminated due to the expansion of the war. Even at the time of the signing, considering Poland's eagerness to expand outward in recent years, no one dared to say they were completely certain.

Recently, there has been a theory circulating here saying that the Soviet Union's intention is to cause a major war between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, and then, when the time is ripe, launch a "world revolution." From a purely theoretical standpoint, this may be justifiable. However, when we connect it to the actual situation, we immediately discover that it is absolutely insufficient to explain this instance of Soviet diplomacy -- as I have said before -- the major premise is that whether Britain, France, Germany, and Italy are willing to engage in a major war is highly questionable, both then and now.

For example, in the past two days, due to the continuous retreat of Polish troops, Germany's arrogance has become very pressing. Thus, for the sake of potential emergencies, the Soviet Union has had to mobilize a large number of troops on its western defense line. If there had been no Soviet-German agreement, why would such a move be necessary? So, it seems that the Soviet Union is creating trouble for itself? And this trouble will only increase going forward. As a result, the Soviet Union's environment of closed-door construction has had to be partially sacrificed. Is it really creating trouble for itself? Absolutely not!

The Soviet Union has taken a major risk and adopted extraordinary diplomatic measures. On the passive side, it is avoiding Chamberlain's descent into an anti-communist crusade. On the active side, it is planning to once and for all build a defensive zone, a buffer zone, against imperialists, stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, by taking matters into its own hands in neighboring countries.

However, the Soviet Union's international environment from now on will indeed be ten or a hundred times more troublesome and dangerous than before! In this future international situation, what does it rely on?

Its greatest reliance, without a doubt, is its own vast worker-peasant Red Army and economic construction.

Secondly, while the current Soviet authorities do not believe that social revolution can be transplanted from one place to another like flowers and plants, they also deny the possibility of a single country establishing a socialist system in isolation and therefore insist on launching a so-called "world revolution." However, in this world where the struggles between capitalist imperialists are becoming increasingly tense and acute, a utopian and secluded single socialist state paradise can absolutely not exist indefinitely in the real world. Therefore, its second weapon and reliance is the struggle of all the oppressed and the proletariat in the lairs of capitalism.

Speaking of this, we cannot help but think that before the Soviet Union had the strength and position in Europe and Asia that it has today, it was indeed under attack by imperialists. But today, Japan in the east is in a state where it is constantly wary of a sudden blow from the Soviet Union, so of course it has fundamentally lost the ability to threaten the Soviet Union. The biggest reason why the Soviet Union is currently able to temporarily depart from its consistent slogan of the so-called "international anti-aggression front" of recent years is that it must give credit to China's resistance war.

In the short term to come, the most fundamental and important aspect of the Soviet Union's foreign policy is its relationship with China. In other foreign policies, it may take a wrong step at some stage, and when it discovers the mistake, it may be able to remedy it, and if it cannot be remedied, it may have the strength to bear the consequences. However, in its relationship with China, it will absolutely not take any wrong steps, because it knows that if a major mistake is made, it will not only be a major disaster for China, but also a major disaster for the Soviet Union!

If we simply summarize the actual assistance the Soviet Union has given to China in the past three years, and then carefully study the theories and tones of all its organizational publications in the past three years, then we should have complete certainty about this point.

In the past two days, the news known here is that the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union and the ambassador to Britain have become very active. The sole task of the ambassador to the Soviet Union is probably to imitate the example of the Soviet-German agreement and also sign a non-aggression treaty in order to undermine the relationship between China and the Soviet Union. To this end, they are also asking Germany to mediate from the sidelines, with the condition that if successful, Japan will promise to then join the vortex threatening Britain and France, helping Germany achieve Hitler's constantly dreamt-of "end to the war." However, according to the results known here, it has had no effect.

Finally, a message to the people of the country: The power of our 450 million people is enough to create all miracles and destroy all enemies! -- Japanese imperialism? Hmph! -- Our current problem is unity, organization, [unclear], in all these processes, we should have complete confidence and trust in all our allies, and especially the Soviet Union!

"To analyze the success of [China's resistance war] to the end, the only hope should be the socialist state of the Soviet Union?"

"No! China welcomes all assistance, and there is no need to reject even practical help from fascist countries in the aggressor group. As for the only hope? China does not hope for anyone, only for itself!" -- I said.

"But I insist on the point that 'the Soviet Union is the only basis for China's hope of success!'"

I concluded: "Your statement explains a part of the objective international situation; my opinion is from the perspective of China itself. There is no conflict between our opinions."

This short dialogue is an excerpt from a conversation I had with British friends at a symposium here last winter. Now I suddenly remember it and transcribe it above, as it seems to still have considerable meaning. (September 9th)

### Shen Bao Cup Charity Basketball: Sino-American Match Dates Set: 19th, 21st, and 22nd Evenings: Chinese Team's Iron Army to be Assembled Soon

The annual Third "Shen Bao Cup" Sino-American Charity Basketball Game, which has garnered citywide attention, is still co-organized by the Shen Bao, the English-language "China Press" newspaper, and the Shanghai YMCA. It is scheduled for the 19th, 21st, and 22nd of this month (Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays), starting at 7 PM each night at the YMCA basketball court.

The American team won the first edition, and the Chinese team won it back last year. Although the departure of renowned players Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun to Yunnan has slightly affected the Chinese team's strength, there are still many talented players, and it will not be difficult to assemble a strong team to defend the brilliant silver cup related to international honor. On the American side, having been humiliated in the previous edition, they will surely seek revenge. With a wealth of talent and a dominant position in Shanghai, their return will be formidable. The encounter will be between worthy opponents, and the chances for both sides can be said to be equal. It is expected that three bloody battles will ignite the ball scene again. Tickets are priced at two yuan and one yuan, and the revenue will be divided into three parts: the Shanghai Refugee Association, the International Red Cross, and the YMCA Christmas Poor Children's Party will each receive one part.
