London – Warsaw Radio Station issued a message today stating that the elite troops of the Polish army have joined the aid operation for the Warsaw garrison. This unit fiercely broke into the city of Warsaw from the rear of the German army, and during the fighting along the way, they captured thousands of German soldiers. These prisoners and the reinforcements marched into the city together. (September 16th, Associated Press)

Paris – According to the Polish Continental Wireless News Agency, German mechanized units attacked the outskirts of Warsaw yesterday but were repelled by the Polish army, suffering heavy casualties. A Polish military communiqué stated that the German army had launched three determined attacks on the outskirts of Warsaw, all of which were repelled. In the fierce fighting, the Polish army destroyed a German tank, seized several motorized vehicles, and a field gun. The enemy suffered significant losses. The war is being waged throughout Poland and has extended northeast to the Lithuanian border. (September 16th, Associated Press)

London – According to the latest Polish communiqué broadcast from Warsaw today, the German troops attacking from the northeast have been contained. In the central sector, the Warsaw garrison is now fighting fiercely to hold its ground. Further south, there is fierce fighting in Łowicz and Skierniewice. The German army has suffered significant losses, and there are no other changes on the front lines. (September 16th, Reuters)

Saliszczyki, Poland – According to reports from the front, the Polish National Army is firmly defending Lviv and valiantly resisting German mechanized units. This unit is quite strong and once broke through to the outskirts of the city, but was ultimately repelled by the Polish defenders. One German unit has advanced to a certain point in the eastern suburbs, so the retreat route for the Lviv defenders is in danger of being cut off. The artillery battle between the two sides is very fierce, and Polish defenses have been greatly affected. According to Polish sources here, the eleventh German mechanized detachment is currently advancing towards Brest. It is reported that several British officers were also in Lviv yesterday. (September 16th, Associated Press)

Warsaw – The semi-official Pat news agency stated that the port of Gdynia in the north is still in our army's hands, and the battle situation is extremely fierce. On the southwest front of Warsaw, the line between the cities of Łowicz and Skierniewice, our army inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. East of Warsaw, the enemy attacked the cities of Białystok and Brest (i.e., Brest-Litovsk). After our army's valiant resistance and two days of fierce fighting, the positions remain unchanged. (September 15th, Havas)

London – According to the latest Polish news, the Polish army is putting up a very effective resistance, and the German strategy is providing the Poles with opportunities for guerrilla warfare to cut off their supplies, especially regarding gasoline. The German attacks on Białystok and Brest-Litovsk seem to be the most serious, as the Germans have the Königsberg-Białystok railway at their disposal. (September 16th, Reuters)

Paris – The hopes of Western countries that the Polish army could use a "Marne-style" battle to prevent German motorized units from encircling Warsaw and the Polish "security triangle" have dimmed today. This is because the Polish General Staff has already admitted that the Polish army failed to prevent German troops from breaking through the Polish army's left and right flanks. The Polish army's two flanks, south of the Bug River, near Sederje, changing to the east of Warsaw, passing the San River, through Przemyśl and the Galician oil fields south of Lviv. With the Polish army's two flanks having been defeated by the German army, the large Polish army in Warsaw, Kutno, Łódź, and Lublin will be in danger of being heavily encircled by the German army. Yesterday's German actions showed that the German General Staff intends to encircle the large Polish army to prevent it from retreating to the swampy area, because in that area of combat, the German army's powerful motorized units will lose their effectiveness. The Polish army in the Vistula River basin will face the threat of German troops from East Prussia attacking from the northeast. With the help of mechanized units, they moved south across the Bug River to Sederje, cutting off the transportation between eastern Poland and Vienna and Brest. This column has moved south towards Lublin and Radom. Military observers today were astonished to see that the famous Polish mud, despite continuous rain, still could not stop the German advance. French military experts still recall that Napoleon, after attacking Poland, wrote a book discussing Polish mud, saying that military strategists must consider Polish mud as the "fourth element" when preparing for Eastern campaigns. (September 16th, Associated Press)

Warsaw – The semi-official Pat news agency has issued a message stating that the German air force is increasingly cruelly bombing our country's undefended towns and cities, and is wreaking havoc on displaced refugees, whether they are traveling by train or on foot. These people are defenseless and can only await death. When a factory in Lviv in the south was destroyed by German aircraft, some eyewitnesses saw that in addition to military pilots, there were also several non-military personnel and women participating in the operation. At 4 p.m. yesterday, eighteen German aircraft flew to the northeastern city of Vilnius (near Lithuania) and bombed it, dropping 200 bombs on the city center. The losses in the city were very heavy, and there were many civilian women and children killed and injured. It is still difficult to determine the exact number for the time being. (September 16th, Havas)

Krzemieniec, Poland – Local officials here have declared that German aircraft have repeatedly strafed Polish refugees on various highways with machine guns. The German authorities have also publicly stated that their aircraft will indiscriminately bomb all undefended cities. To date, the cities of Sederje, Lublin, and Częstochowa have been reduced to rubble. The city hall and opera house in Warsaw have been burned down. Countless towns have been completely destroyed. Many compatriots have died in various places and can only be buried hastily in nearby parks and fields. (September 15th, Havas)

Lviv – The radio station here issued a message stating that 20,000 civilians were killed by bombing when German aircraft bombed the city. Civilian casualties exceeded military casualties. Many Polish towns and cities have been attacked by German aircraft, including Sederje and Częstochowa. German aircraft flew extremely low, almost touching the trees, and used machine guns to strafe refugees on the road. After a Polish aircraft was shot down by German aircraft, the German army used the aircraft to machine-gun the Polish pilot. (September 16th, Associated Press)

Zaleszczyki, Poland – German aircraft are still bombing undefended cities in Poland and strafing civilians with machine guns at low altitude. More than eighty residents of Komarów were killed, and many residents of Łuck were injured. The car carrying personnel from the British Embassy in Poland was shot at by German aircraft between Krzemieniec and Nyrówopol yesterday, but fortunately, it was not hit. Furthermore, as a result of the bombing of Krzemieniec on the 12th of this month, 30 residents died and more than 100 were injured. (September 15th, Havas)

The battle to attack the city of Brest-Litovsk is currently underway. (September 16th, Reuters)

### Germany Prepares for a Protracted War; Defensive Posture Temporarily Adopted on the Western Front; Residents Being Evacuated

Danzig – Foreign observers here recently stated that the German authorities, having gradually lost hope for a swift and peaceful end to the war, are preparing to evacuate a large number of residents from various places in the west, and further restrict food consumption to plan for a protracted conflict. A correspondent for a "political newspaper" here telegraphed from Berlin, saying: "The German government is deeply aware that the hope for a quick victory is extremely slim and is eager to resolve the Polish issue in a short period of time first, so that it can concentrate its forces on the Western Front. Even the Germans do not deny that preparations on the Western Front are not yet perfect." It is rumored that the German army hopes to adopt a defensive posture as much as possible on the Western Front this winter and begin a real large-scale war in the spring. In addition, a correspondent for the "Berliner Zeitung" stationed in Germany telegraphed: "The German government has already begun evacuating residents in the west, totaling no less than 18 million to 20 million people, and will soon intensify the effort." (September 15th, Havas)

### Hitler Flies to Inspect the Front Lines

Berlin – According to an official report issued by the Führer's headquarters, Führer Hitler flew to the front lines yesterday to inspect the situation. As he flew over Upper Silesia and the Kraków industrial area from Przemyśl to Galicia, he was pleased to see that all industries were intact and that shops and factories were operating as usual. Hitler then personally inspected two German divisions crossing the San River, most of which were Austrian provincial troops. (September 16th, Haitong)

### Upper Silesia Merged into Germany; Göring Inspects Industrial Zone

Berlin – The Chief Civil Administrator of Upper Silesia, stationed in Katowice, yesterday issued two decrees announcing the re-integration of the eastern part of Upper Silesia into Germany. The checkpoints between the eastern and western parts of Upper Silesia have been abolished, restoring the German borders before 1919. At the same time, it is stipulated that various wages, salaries, and commodity prices in the eastern part of Upper Silesia will be the same as in other parts of Germany. Yesterday, a coal train left for Germany, and factories have resumed work one after another. Postal and telephone services will also return to normal within a few days. (September 16th, Haitong)

Zurich, Switzerland – German radio stations recently broadcasted a message saying that the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, General von Brauchitsch, visited Łódź, Poland (southeast of Warsaw) yesterday. Air Force Commander-in-Chief Göring, after visiting Führer Hitler, went to inspect the industrial zone in Upper Silesia to reform the original factories in Poland to suit German military needs. It was also said that Poland was incited by the United Kingdom to fight, so the United Kingdom should be responsible for its defeat. Other countries should take Poland as a warning. As for the British blockade policy, it is indeed a terrible weapon, but it will affect neutral countries rather than Germany. In the future, Germany will impose a more effective blockade on the United Kingdom. (September 15th, Havas)

Breslau – The leader of the German Labor Front, Mr. Ley, visited the Schalen zinc mine in the industrial area of Upper Silesia this afternoon. This mine was still in the hands of the Poles ten days ago, and it has now fully resumed production. Since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, Poland has occupied 8,700,000 square meters of German zinc ore, while Germany only retains 2,600,000 square meters. (September 15th, Haitong)

### Polish Air Force Warriors Achieve Commendable Results; Ram Enemy Aircraft, Perishing Together

Paris – According to a broadcast message released today by the Polish official news agency, a certain Polish airman, after using up all his ammunition, was surrounded by twelve German bombers. The airman then piloted his aircraft to ram the largest of the German aircraft, perishing together. After this incident, many Polish airmen have imitated his actions. In an air battle near Modlin, a Polish pilot, after being wounded by bullets, piloted his aircraft to collide with a German bomber, resulting in both aircraft catching fire and being destroyed. The wounded Polish pilot managed to save his life. (September 16th, Reuters)

Situation of French and German Front Lines on the Western Front

### German Counter-Offensive on the Western Front Repelled; French Troops Occupy Important High Ground; Threaten Siegfried Line from a Commanding Position; German Army Destroys Moselle River Railway Bridge

Paris – The General Headquarters issued War Report No. 25, stating: "All areas on the front line were very active last night. The enemy south of Saarbrücken used extremely fierce artillery fire. Our army continued to advance in many places east of the Moselle River. The enemy downstream of the Nied River (a tributary of the Saar River) first used artillery to bombard, and then launched a fierce counter-offensive, which was ultimately repelled by our army." (September 16th, Havas)

Paris – The French military strategy is to straighten the salient angles of the border line, with Saarbrücken as its nearest destination. According to military observers, the French army could have already occupied Saarbrücken, but for the sake of prudence, they want to occupy it only when the encirclement is completed without any flaws. (September 16th, Reuters)

Paris – The semi-official commentary on General Headquarters War Report No. 25 stated: "The German army launched a large-scale counter-offensive yesterday on the high ground between the northern end of the Warndt Forest and the Nied River but was repelled by the French army. The French army is advancing in a systematic manner, gradually occupying this high ground. The eastern part of this area is an excellent artillery base, possessing a commanding position. It can bombard the enemy's positions in Saarland and the entire Saar River basin and the Siegfried Line. The importance of its position is self-evident. The enemy is now fiercely bombarding the French army's rear lines of communication and using large numbers of infantry to counter-attack, hoping to contain our army's advance, but they were repelled by our army." (September 16th, Havas)

London – The situation on the Western Front has gradually attracted attention. Military observers here all say that the French army's recent attack on Sierck has put more pressure on the German army. General Gamelin, the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces, is now proceeding with everything in an extremely cautious manner, and should not underestimate the strength of the German army. Many believe that the French army is currently in a position to announce the occupation of Saarbrücken, but it is still waiting for the encirclement of the city to avoid the risk of encountering setbacks. The French army that has advanced into German territory has now dug deep trenches and built high fortifications, and its position is very strong. The Allied air force is also clearly superior to the German air force. One thing that is particularly noteworthy is that the German artillery is limited to heavy artillery. In reality, the firing of field artillery will be more accurate, but if it moves within range, it is in danger of being destroyed by French tanks. (September 16th, Reuters)

Paris – The General Headquarters recently issued War Report No. 24, stating: "In recent days, the positions occupied by our army have been consolidated. The enemy's counter-offensive was ineffective and suffered heavy losses. The enemy used artillery to fiercely bombard our army's positions in a certain part of the front line. Enemy aircraft also joined the battle, flying very low over our front line, and were immediately repelled by our fighter squadrons." (September 15th, Havas)

Beijing – According to news from Luxembourg, the French army attacking the Moselle region has occupied the village of Perl, and the French army has now penetrated into the German border. The French army is now advancing along the road to Saarlouis. The fighting near the Luxembourg border is very fierce and continuous throughout the day. In order to prevent the French army from advancing, the German army destroyed a railway bridge over the Moselle River, causing metal fragments to fall into various villages and streets of Luxembourg in the area. Fortunately, the residents of the village had already evacuated. The German army was forced to abandon Perl in a hurry before they could destroy the railway bridge. (September 15th, Reuters)

Paris – According to a semi-official report on the military situation on the Western Front, French infantry have now occupied German strongholds north of Sierck. It is reported that several battalions of French infantry, assisted by tanks, have seized several important strongholds on the Saar front, including two villages and an observation post. The French army continued to advance yesterday and at night, despite the bad weather and the high-altitude fire of the German artillery. The German artillery stationed outside the Guébling line launched a counter-offensive, but failed to prevent the French army from improving the positions it had occupied at night. The important war in recent days has been to defeat the German attack in the Sierck area along the Moselle River. With the help of tanks, the French infantry not only drove the German troops back to their original defenses, but also occupied the common defense area to prevent their future counter-attacks. Thus, the general situation of the French army's front line in that area has been improved. When the German army retreated, they destroyed the railway line along the Moselle River as much as possible. Progress was also heard to be made in other locations on the Western Front, especially twelve miles west of the Saar. (September 15th, Reuters)

### German Aircraft Forced to Land in Soviet Territory

Moscow – On September 15th, an aircraft of unknown nationality was discovered over Olevsk, Ukraine. Soviet troops shot it down with machine guns, forcing it to land near the village of Ruzhino. It was proven to be a German twin-engine bomber. The five crew members were sent to Kiev, and the original aircraft was guarded. (September 16th, TASS)

### German Submarines Still Active; Three Merchant Ships Sunk

London – It is reported that the British cargo ship "Fanad Head" was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean today. This cargo ship belongs to the North Antrim Shipping Co. and has a displacement of 5,200 tons. In addition, the British fishing vessel "Lavalera" (displacement 290 tons) was also sunk today. This is the first fishing vessel to be lost since the outbreak of war between Britain and Germany. The captain and eleven sailors were rescued by a small boat. It is said that after sinking the ship, the German submarine also opened fire on it.

London – The Ministry of Information announced that the British-American oil tanker "Cheyenne" (8,825 tons) has been sunk by a German submarine. The crew members were all rescued by the Norwegian ship "Ietbark." (September 16th, Reuters)

London – The Belgian cargo ship "Oostende," returning to Antwerp from New York, was sunk by a submarine in the English Channel last night. All passengers and crew members were rescued by the Greek ship "Atlantic" and have landed in a certain coastal area of ​​England. Six sailors were seriously injured and have been sent to the hospital for treatment. According to the engineer of the "Oostende," Mr. Steen, no one saw the submarine. "I was in the engine room when I suddenly heard a loud explosion. All the lights on the ship immediately went out, and I heard several gunshots. We ran to the deck and saw that the ship had split into two. At that time, the sea was calm. The seven passengers and crew members went to the lifeboats to escape, and were soon rescued by the 'Atlantic.'" The owner of the "Atlantic" said that he had witnessed a German submarine. A student from the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, Mr. Clerck, also said, "I was on the deck when the 'Oostende' was hit by a torpedo. Passengers and crew members were very calm when they went to the lifeboats and there was no panic." (September 16th, Havas)

Editorial

### The Soviet-Japanese Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and International Affairs

Yesterday, the Soviet Union and Japan signed an agreement to cease hostile actions between the armies on the borders of Japan, "Manchukuo," the Soviet Union, and "Mongolia." The full text of the agreement, consisting of four articles, is published in today's news section. Simultaneously, the Soviet Union appointed Smetanin as its ambassador to Japan. Furthermore, there are reports that both sides will organize a commission to demarcate the border. Tokyo also announced that after the agreement is established, the two countries will continue to negotiate other issues.

The drastic changes in the international situation and the contradictions in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan have been frequently commented on by this newspaper. Regarding the Soviet-Japanese agreement, there is a need to address it from multiple perspectives. However, for the sake of clarity and to avoid repetition, we quote the following points from our recent editorials:

"The Soviet Union only wishes to observe the rise and fall of capitalist countries." (August 28th Editorial)

"Given the situation in Europe, the intentions and actions of the United States and the Soviet Union, which are sufficient to influence the Far East, are becoming increasingly important." (September 2nd Editorial)

"The highest form of diplomacy between the Soviet Union and Japan is to coexist peacefully without conflict. To say that the two countries can share adversity and be on the same front is a false assumption that goes against human nature. What does Japan expect? The Soviet Union has gone a step further with Germany from a non-aggression treaty to a military alliance. According to the alliance, the Soviet Union and Germany will join forces in Europe, thus Japan will obtain the most ideal opportunity." (September 9th Editorial)

"As for the Soviet Union, its principles, politics, economy, and military strategy are more complex than other countries in terms of what should be considered gains and losses. Therefore, its policies are most difficult to grasp, and its actions and changes are most likely to be different... In the Far East, it has no demands on Japan, nor is it afraid of Japan" (Ibid.)

We believe that the above points have not been shaken by the Soviet-Japanese agreement, and that some of the significance of the Soviet-Japanese agreement can be found in the previous analysis. If the Soviet Union has even greater ambitions, it is possible to take further action beyond signing the agreement to cease hostilities with Japan. However, as of today, we do not assume this.

Regarding the Soviet-Japanese agreement, it should not be seen as a surprising move. The dispatch of ambassadors and the signing of agreements to coexist peacefully without conflict are normal diplomatic relations, within the highest limits of normal diplomatic relations, and not unexpected. Moreover, as evidenced by the resolution of the Changkufeng Incident last year, this agreement is the second compromise that Japan has been forced to make with the Soviet Union, and it is not a new one. Furthermore, Japan's prior replacement of the head of "Manchukuo" was to show sincerity to the Soviet Union, and it was not sudden. Moreover, the main internal reason for the conflicts between the two sides since early May was the joint manipulation by Germany and pro-German military personnel in Japan. It only created a more favorable environment for Germany to win over the Soviet Union. Now that Japan's pro-German dream has vanished, there is naturally no reason to support the tension between the Soviet Union and Japan. From tension to peace is merely a retreat, not an expansion. Therefore, the essence of the Soviet-Japanese agreement is still a commonplace international dynamic. However, after the Soviet Union and Germany became friendly, Japan was particularly isolated. The cabinet change was intended to revise its international relations. Soon after, it was able to eliminate the tension with the Soviet Union. Therefore, even if there is nothing else after the agreement, and the essence of the agreement is said to be commonplace, from Japan's perspective, it cannot be denied as Abe's first achievement since coming into office!

Moreover, why did the Soviet Union sign this agreement with Japan? Regarding everything about the Soviet Union, we do not want to try to "guess". Therefore, when the Soviet Union and Germany concluded a treaty, many in the world claimed that the Soviet Union would have no worries about the West and would devote all its efforts to the Far East. We only believed that it "could" devote its efforts to the Far East, but "whether it will do anything is another question." Therefore, to say that the Soviet Union will do this or that after it and Japan agree to cease hostile actions would be premature. In short, to observe the intentions of the Soviet Union, we can only watch one step and know one step. Before it takes its second step, we have no way of knowing its intentions. What can be said is: (1) Many of the Soviet Union's actions over the years have not been understood by the international community. For example, its negotiations with Britain and France in Moscow were diligent and tireless, but it suddenly announced the establishment of a treaty with Germany. Therefore, those who criticize the Soviet Union say that it is insincere and untrustworthy. However, as we remember, the Soviet Union has never broken its word within the scope of its "actual commitments." The great disease and great mistake of the world is to mistakenly believe that the Soviet Union's insincere evasions, or general discussions of principles, or sincere interactions that have not reached maturity, have not reached conclusions, or have not been completed, means that the Soviet Union has already tacitly agreed, promised, and agreed. The Soviet Union does not believe that it should be bound by this, so it has never violated its obligations. The Soviet-Japanese agreement is like that, while China and the Soviet Union have a non-aggression treaty, committing to not conclude treaties with other countries that are detrimental to China, and committing to oppose aggression. Therefore, the Soviet-Japanese agreement should not be intended to be detrimental to China. Even if there are other actions with Japan after the Soviet-Japanese agreement, it should not be detrimental to China's resistance to aggression. (2) There must be a significant meaning behind the Soviet Union's interruption of its negotiations with Britain and France and its treaty with Germany, and it is not accidental. Now, Britain and France are at war with Germany. To infer the outcome of the war from the current stage, even those who are not happy with Britain and France cannot deny that Britain and France have an advantage, which is due to their economic power. The Soviet Union has no reason to sit idly by as Germany moves forward as much as possible, and has no reason to tolerate Germany's dominance over Europe, but it is also unwilling to see Germany completely defeated. Otherwise, if we do not unite with Britain and France to restrain Germany, and Germany concludes a treaty with the Soviet Union, it will be meaningless and akin to madness. However, as facts show, Germany first concluded a treaty with the Soviet Union and appeared to be isolated internationally, and now it is facing enemies on several fronts and will eventually be defeated. Britain and France have an advantage over Germany, and the cowardly and contemptible elements in their countries are plotting to induce Japan to increase their influence. At the same time, Japan, in the international community, is extremely isolated after being abandoned by Germany due to its past grievances with the Soviet Union. It is trying to maintain its advantageous conditions and get closer to Britain and France. All of this is what the Soviet Union does not want to sit idly by and let Britain and France collude with Japan. Knowing that Japan is particularly wary of the Soviet Union, it is therefore more willing to be friendly with Britain and France. When Japan reorganized its cabinet, hoping to dispel suspicion, it quickly agreed to conclude an agreement to cease hostilities. Therefore, to say that it has affection for Japan is more like helping Germany and encouraging Japan to deal with Britain and France. If the Soviet Union does not have this intention, its impact on objective facts will undoubtedly be to increase Japan's courage to blackmail Britain and France!

### The Establishment of a Soviet-Japanese Armistice Agreement on the Mongolian Border: Cessation of All Hostile Actions Yesterday; Both Sides to Immediately Survey the "Manchu"-Mongolian Border; The Soviet Union Appoints Smetanin as Ambassador to Japan

Moscow – As a result of talks between Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov in recent days, an agreement has been reached between Japan "Manchukuo" and the Soviet-Mongolian side as follows:

1.  The Japan "Manchukuo" army and the Soviet-Mongolian army will cease all hostile actions at 2:00 PM Moscow time on September 16th.

2.  The Japan "Manchukuo" army and the Soviet-Mongolian army will each remain in the original occupied lines at 12:00 PM Moscow time on September 15th.

3.  The representatives of the local armies on both sides will immediately implement Articles 1 and 2 of this agreement.

4.  Prisoners of war and corpses should be exchanged. Regarding this matter, the representatives of the local armies on both sides should immediately consult and implement it.

In addition, as a result of the talks between Togo and Molotov, both sides agreed that the Soviet-Mongolian and Japanese "Manchukuo" sides will each send two representatives to establish a committee as soon as possible to survey the exact border between the Mongolian People's Republic and "Manchukuo" in the area where the recent conflict occurred. The committee should begin work immediately after it is established. (TASS dispatch, 16th)

Moscow – The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has recently appointed Smetanin as Ambassador to Japan. (TASS dispatch, 16th)

Moscow – According to reliable sources, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov for four hours yesterday. It is heard that this conversation, regarding the armistice on the Outer Mongolian border, is nearing its final stage. There are also rumors that the Soviet Union and Japan are about to conclude a non-aggression treaty, but this has not been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Moscow – Observers from various countries here have recently commented on the agreement reached between Japan and the Soviet Union on the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, saying that each country hopes to resolve various outstanding issues, and that general relations can be improved as a result. Since the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, Japanese Ambassador Togo has notified the Soviet government that the Japanese government is willing to discuss various outstanding issues with the Soviet Union in the hope of establishing a peaceful solution. Up to this point, Japan has no objection to the positions taken by the Red Army near the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, which the Soviet Union considers to be the true boundary of "Manchu"-Mongolia. This is also another clear indication of the country's moderate attitude. However, the saying that Japan and the Soviet Union should negotiate a non-aggression treaty is at least premature. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Moscow – According to well-informed sources here today, the settlement of the Nomonhan conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union originated in Berlin. From this, it can be seen that the Axis powers are still active diplomatically. However, the Japanese side here is doubtful about the possibility of the Soviet Union and Japan concluding a non-aggression treaty. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

Bairshagaal – At 6:00 AM on the 16th, the headquarters of a certain Japanese army issued an order to the soldiers in the Kherlengiin Heer steppe to immediately cease the attack. After this order was issued, the reporter saw a Japanese reconnaissance plane flying low to the south, and the Soviet infantry did not fire a single shot at it. Also, the Soviet mechanized unit was ordered to return to the Red Army warehouse at this time. Therefore, the military forces of Japan and the Soviet Union have returned to harmony and are stationed in their respective territories. The flags of the Soviet Union and the two countries are flying high on their national territories. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 16th)

Tokyo – The Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement at 1:00 PM today, saying that the Japanese government is making efforts to resolve the various outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, and that the governments of Japan and the Soviet Union both believe that the resolution of the dispute in Nomonhan, "Manchu"-Mongolia, can remove the unpleasant atmosphere between the two countries and promote the normalization of national relations. Ambassador Togo met with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov several times, and as a result of the negotiations, an armistice agreement was reached between the two countries on September 15th. (Domei dispatch, 16th)

Tokyo – The Army Department of the Imperial General Headquarters announced at 1:00 PM this afternoon that the Outer Mongolian Soviet army in the Nomonhan area increased its forces on August 20th and attacked both sides of the Japanese army's position. The Japanese side also increased some forces to continue fierce fighting, and both sides suffered considerable losses. However, after the war gradually calmed down in September, the authorities of Japan and the Soviet Union conducted diplomatic negotiations, and today the two sides agreed to decide on an armistice. (Domei dispatch, 16th)

Tokyo – The newspapers here expressed satisfaction with the establishment of the border armistice agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan, and public bonds also rose unanimously. According to the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, after Japanese Prime Minister Abe announced the adjustment of diplomatic relations with foreign countries, he telegraphed Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo to seek a way to resolve outstanding issues with the Soviet Union. After receiving the order, Togo signed the armistice agreement with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov. It is expected that after the general principles are determined, the committee for demarcating the border will soon go to the scene of the incident to meet. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

Chongqing – Although the Chinese community knows that the Soviet Union and Japan are conducting negotiations in Moscow, the news of the signing of the armistice agreement between the two countries has caused great fear. It is the public's opinion that the United States must now pay close attention to the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan, as Japan can act freely in Asia and may further infringe upon the interests of the United States in the Far East. Some say that the establishment of the agreement will not affect the Soviet Union's aid to China, as the Soviet Union continued to aid China after the establishment of the Changkufeng armistice agreement in the past. The Chinese political community currently has no comment on this matter, which was expected, because the Japanese are eager to clear up the border war in order to concentrate on dealing with China. The Chinese community is now eagerly awaiting news of continued developments. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Washington – American officials are unwilling to express opinions on the Soviet-Japanese "Manchu"-Mongolian border armistice agreement until more detailed conditions are obtained. According to the Soviet-Japanese agreement, it is not sudden due to the fact that the Japanese side has already spent a lot on the war against China and does not want to have any more disputes with the Soviet Union. Secondly, Japan wants to take advantage of the opportunity of the European war to do some good business, so it started by signing a peace treaty with the Soviet Union to stimulate its foreign trade. American officials expect that the Japanese side may soon establish a new agreement with the United States, as for the Soviet Union, it is happy to establish an armistice agreement with Japan because it intends to deal with Poland. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

New York – After the establishment of an armistice agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union on the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, the morning papers here are saying that the Soviet Union's policy is to expand the European war into a world war. The New York Times reported, "Some say that the Soviet Union and Japan established an agreement in order to prevent Germany from advancing too far, and another says that the establishment of an agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union is the inevitable result of the establishment of a non-aggression treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union. Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan may even establish an agreement as the first step in a new division of European countries. Senator Borah, who had just given a speech last night, argued that the United States should stay out of the European war, and who knows that this kind of war has affected half of the world." The Min Sheng Jiang Tan Bao used the word "unfathomable," saying, "If we cannot speculate on the Soviet Red Army's desires for Eastern Europe, then we will also be unable to understand the circumstances under which Japan made peace with the Soviet Union. In short, what is the goal of Japan's peace with the Soviet Union? It will not be easy to know until the Soviet Union takes action." (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Berlin – Political figures here have recently commented on the establishment of the armistice agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union on the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, saying that this is an "expected event." Each country should also establish a non-aggression treaty in the short term. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

Berlin – Political figures in Berlin welcomed the Soviet-Japanese agreement to resolve the Manchu-Mongolian border dispute. It is also recalled that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop said when signing the German-Soviet non-aggression pact that the conclusion of this pact would not only benefit German-Japanese friendship but would also be beneficial to German-Japanese friendship. The Germans hope that this will be the first step towards a Soviet-Japanese peace agreement, and that understanding between the Soviet Union and Japan can be guided by this. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)

### The Soviet Union Remains a Huge Enigma in the European Situation; The Intention of the Army Mobilization is Difficult to Predict; The Soviet-Japanese Armistice Adds to the Suspicion

London – According to a diplomatic correspondent for Reuters, the Soviet Union remains a huge enigma in the current European situation. After refusing to offer Turkey and Britain a mutual assistance agreement and signing a non-aggression pact with Germany, it was generally believed that the Soviet Union did so in order to be able to act freely in the Far East and avoid worries about the West. However, since then, things have changed very quickly, and now it is suddenly heard that the Soviet Union has signed an armistice agreement with Japan. It is the public's opinion that after this move, it may be followed by a small non-aggression agreement, so that Moscow will have no worries about the future and can act freely in Europe, which is not entirely unexpected. How the Soviet Union will use this freedom is a major question today. Recently, the Moscow Pravda published an article saying that the ten million Ukrainians and Belarusians in Poland have been abused, implying that the Soviet Union will make demands on Poland. The report also put forward two possibilities: (1) The Soviet Union may have signed an agreement with Germany to divide Poland; (2) Moscow may be alarmed by the rapid victory of the German army in Poland and is now preparing to demand certain territories in Poland if the German army advances too far. The Soviet Union's mobilization of four million troops to implement one of the above two points can be seen as the Soviet Union has made every effort to prepare for the worst. Germany's attitude towards the Soviet Union also seems to be in the dark and disturbed, just like the rest of the world. According to the correspondent, the Soviet-Japanese armistice can enable the Japanese to concentrate on dealing with the China incident, but it is still a point of contention whether Japan is convinced of this armistice agreement and dares to slightly withdraw its 300,000 troops stationed on the Soviet-Mongolian border to join the war against China. It cannot be believed that the suspicion between the Soviet Union and Japan can vanish overnight, and the same can be said of Soviet-German relations, and even more so. In short, the signing of the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement has not clarified the overall situation, but has only added to the new confusion. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Paris – Political figures here have recently commented on the establishment of an armistice agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union on the "Manchu"-Mongolian border, saying that the reason why the Soviet Union is willing to end the five-month-long state of hostility is because the country is more actively involved in European affairs. Even if Japan's neutrality is temporary, the Soviet Union can take this opportunity to shift its attention to the current situation in the West. Although the easing of Soviet-Japanese relations is due to the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, another clear proof can be obtained that the so-called basic principles of National Socialism have no fixed nature. The signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Japan and Germany violates the principle of racism, while the signing of the non-aggression pact by Germany and the Soviet Union contradicts the principle of anti-communism. Today, Japan, which signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, has reconciled with the Soviet Union, which has always been called its number one enemy. It is unknown how to reconcile the fact that the Soviet Union's activities in the Far East are one of the reasons for Japan's war against China. (Havas dispatch, 16th)

### Two Factions of the US Congress Engage in Off-Site Propaganda War; Roosevelt's Proposal to Congress Will Be Limited to Amending the Neutrality Act

Washington – President Roosevelt told reporters today that he intends to limit his recommendations to Congress at a special session on the 21st of this month to amendments to the Neutrality Act. President Roosevelt will send a message to Congress, stating that the message will take the form of a speech to a joint session of the House and Senate. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)

Washington – Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, after President Roosevelt decided to convene a special session of Congress on the 21st of this month, people from both sides in favor and against the amendment have begun to debate. Republican Senator Borah recently gave a speech here, opposing the abolition of the arms embargo clause, with two arguments: (1) Abolishing the arms embargo clause would obviously benefit Britain and France, which would violate the meaning of neutrality; (2) What the government is doing here is not trying to maintain peace, but trying to help Britain and France. If we follow this path, the United States will inevitably be dragged into the whirlpool of war. However, a certain newspaper immediately refuted this, saying that if the arms trade is indeed regarded as a violation of neutrality, then other goods used for war, such as copper, cotton, and kerosene, should also be subject to embargo. Moreover, Borah deliberately confused isolationists with "peace advocates" in his speech and referred to those who advocate amending the Neutrality Act as "war advocates," the intention of which is obviously to confuse public opinion and make them believe that the United States' amendment to the Neutrality Act is a move towards war. But in reality, the United States will not join the war unless Germany takes some action to anger American public opinion. According to political figures, it can be seen from Borah's speech that he does not want to win people over with reason, but only to stimulate national emotions. In addition, Republican Senator Nye also opposed the abolition of the arms embargo clause, believing that after allowing arms to be shipped to the belligerent countries, the arms merchants and financiers would use it as a source of profit and provide credit loans to the belligerent countries, which could result in the United States joining the war to protect the safety of this investment. As for Republican Senator Vandenberg's opposition to arms exports, it is based on domestic political reasons, because he believes that for the benefit of the party, it is necessary to oppose all policies promoted by President Roosevelt. In short, even if a certain issue is not within the scope of party disputes, if President Roosevelt has any claims, it must be opposed. (Havas dispatch, 15th)

Washington – President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the special session of Congress has been scheduled for next week, and that the topic of discussion will be limited to amending the Neutrality Act. He also said that he does not intend to ask Congress to draft special legislation restricting monopolies, as all plans should be implemented in accordance with the principles of peacetime. The President also said that the scope of American territorial waters should be divided according to the needs of the national interest. Accordingly, the US Navy often carries out "neutral patrols" within its sphere of influence. At this point, a reporter asked whether the scope of territorial waters included the Rhine River in Europe. The President smiled and replied that this definition only applies to "salt water." Also, Democrats believe that after the arms embargo clause is abolished, the majority of Democrats in Congress can be re-coordinated, so they are optimistic about the future. It is reported that the Democratic isolationist members of Congress will unite with the Republican members of Congress to repeatedly oppose the bill proposed by the President. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

Washington – Famous American aviator Colonel Lindbergh broadcast to the nation last night, advocating that the United States not participate in the European war. He said, "If the United States participates, millions of American lives will be lost in the war. We must never participate in the European war. If anyone advocates participation, they must be crazy and will endanger American democracy. If we fight for European democracy, our own democracy will perish. The United States has great naval, land, and air forces and is absolutely not afraid of foreign aggression. The current conflict in Europe is a quarrel in their large family's long history, and this quarrel is caused by the mistakes made in the last Great War." (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

### Japan Decides to Temporarily Maintain the Exchange Rate with the US Dollar

New York – Banks here received formal notification from officials yesterday that Japan has decided to temporarily maintain the exchange rate of one Japanese yen to 23 and 5/16 US cents. Economic circles say that this is an abandonment of Japan's previous policy of maintaining the price of one Japanese yen to one shilling and two pence in British currency. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)

### New York Foreign Exchange Market Turmoil: Pound Sterling Plummets

New York. Today, the New York foreign exchange market was extremely turbulent. The pound sterling opened at a new low of $3.73, but then rebounded, closing at $3.88, down two cents from yesterday. Although the Foreign Exchange Committee stated yesterday that the U.S. demand for U.S. dollars, whether related to settling pre-war pound sterling balances or current commercial dealings with the British Empire, could be settled in London at a rate of $4.02, by the time the market opened today, Britain had not yet implemented this promise. Although market participants believed that the details would be revealed soon, those holding pound sterling did not want to wait and rushed to sell, causing market chaos. This is the main reason for today's sharp drop in the pound sterling. Amsterdam was a major seller, and other countries were also involved in settlements. New York is the only place in the world market where pound sterling can be sold without restrictions, so many transactions have moved to New York. Normally, these transactions would have been completed abroad. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has sold thousands of pounds sterling from its account, but this has not been confirmed. The Shanghai legal tender fell below the price of seven U.S. dollars in today's market. (Reuters, 15th)

### Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Visits Hull to Discuss Far East Issues: Japan Intends to Revise Trade Treaty; Toshio Shiratori Returns Home via the U.S.

Washington. Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Kensuke Horiuchi visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday to discuss Far East issues. According to Horiuchi's statement to reporters, he did not make any suggestions regarding changing the current situation in the Shanghai International Settlement. (Associated Press, 16th)

Washington. Secretary of State Hull met with reporters on the 15th and discussed the content of his meeting with Japanese Ambassador Horiuchi, saying, "Today I met with Ambassador Horiuchi and exchanged views on various issues between Japan and the United States. We intend to continue holding talks in the future." (Domei News Agency, 15th)

Rome. Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Toshio Shiratori, left for the port of Naples tonight to take a ship back to Japan via the United States. (Havas, 15th)

Rome. Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Toshio Shiratori, left here yesterday, carrying a report he co-authored with Hiroshi Oshima regarding the relationship between Japan and the Axis powers of Germany and Italy. Because Mussolini met with Shiratori in the middle of last week, there is considerable importance attached to this report. It is widely believed that this report includes Japan's relationship with the Axis powers, and the Far East issue will also be discussed. Shiratori will detour through New York, Washington, and San Francisco and will meet with Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Kensuke Horiuchi in Washington. Both Shiratori and Oshima met with the Japanese military and economic delegation, which has suspended its trip to Germany and also returned to Japan yesterday. (Associated Press, 16th)

Washington. Secretary of State Hull hinted at a press conference yesterday that Japan had wanted to renegotiate a new trade treaty with the United States to replace the one concluded in 1911, which had been abrogated. Someone asked the Secretary of State whether this issue was discussed during yesterday's meeting with Japanese Ambassador Horiuchi. Hull replied that specific details were not discussed, but it is believed that the issue was touched upon. Regarding the Japanese military's invitation to the commanders of the defense forces of various countries in Shanghai for talks, Hull said that he had not yet received a specific report, and that such a meeting might be held again to discuss the Japanese proposal to amend the defense plan for the International Settlement. The Japanese Embassy also issued a very interesting statement, saying that Japan's goal is self-sufficiency, but it is also striving to adjust foreign trade in this new environment. (Associated Press, 16th)

### Canada's War Effort

London. The Information Department recently published an article entitled "Canada and the Current War," stating that during the last European War, Canada sent an expeditionary force of 620,000 men to Europe to assist in the war. Afterwards, 40,000 died or went missing, 12,000 died from injuries, and 141,000 were injured. This was the contribution of the Canadian Federation in the last European War. This time, it has again joined the war for the same reason. It is not difficult to imagine how much military force it can supply, as the Federal Parliament has recently passed a bill allocating 100 million yuan as temporary defense funds. Moreover, during the last European War, Canada's various industries were still in their infancy. Today, the federation's industry is highly developed, and its material contributions will certainly be far greater than before. In addition, Canada, among all the autonomous dominions of the British Empire, is the closest to the British mainland and is naturally the most convenient source of supply. (Havas, 15th)

### Romania Defends Neutrality: Implements Various Precautions

Bucharest. Romanian Prime Minister Gheorghe Tătărescu issued a statement yesterday declaring that, in view of the events on the Baltic border, the Romanian government has decided to take the following steps to safeguard Romania's neutrality: (1) From a humanitarian standpoint, the right of asylum will be granted to all children and injured persons; (2) Any soldiers or troops who flee into Romania will be immediately disarmed and detained until the end of the war; (3) Polish government officials must still reside in the area designated by Romania and must not engage in any further political activities; (4) All private individuals fleeing from Galicia are not allowed to enter Romanian territory. (Haitong, 16th)

Bucharest. Romanian Gendarmerie Commander Marinescu, along with Romanian Ambassador to Poland Grigore Gafencu, arrived yesterday at the Cristești station on the Romanian border. The station is separated from the current Polish capital, Tsariscisky, only by the Dniester River. It is widely believed that the arrival of the two men at that location is in preparation for receiving the Polish President and other government officials. (Haitong, 16th)

### France Invests Heavily in Poland

Berlin. According to reliable statistics, foreign investment in Poland in 1938 reached 1,500,000,000 złoty, of which France accounted for the most, totaling 185,000,000 złoty, or 27%. The United Kingdom ranked second, accounting for 5.5%. Therefore, most of Poland's important factories and public utilities are controlled by foreigners, especially French investors. Prominent examples include the construction of the port of Gdynia, the railway between Upper Silesia and Gdynia, and the exploitation of the Sandomierz coal mine and the oil fields of Upper Silesia, all of which were largely invested in by France. At present, the power over the national railways of Poland is entirely in the hands of the Franco-Polish Railway Company, which was formed in 1931. According to last year's annual report, the company reached 376,000,000 francs, most of which were owned by French people. (Haitong, 16th)

### Lux Resigns from U.S. Treasury Advisor Position: To Become General Manager of Universal Trading Corporation

Washington. Lux, technical advisor to the Treasury Department and director of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, has recently resigned. His vacancy is slated to be filled by Goklan, former financial counselor at the embassy in France. It is rumored that Lux will take the position of general manager of the Universal Trading Corporation, which was established by the Chinese side and is currently using the US$25 million in credit granted to China by the U.S. Federal Export-Import Bank last year to purchase trucks from the United States. (Havas, 15th)

### Rumors of German-Soviet Understanding: Division of Spheres of Influence in Eastern Europe; Large Soviet Army Concentrated on Western Border; Romania in Fear and Apprehension

The Hague. Reliable sources in Berlin recently reported that German political figures have said that after recent talks between Germany and the Soviet Union, they have decided to divide up Eastern Europe as follows: (1) The Soviet Union, when the war between Germany and Poland enters its final stage, will cooperate with Germany. Once Poland is defeated, the areas inhabited by the Little Russian ethnic group north to Vilnius and the Ukrainian ethnic group south to Lviv will be occupied by the Soviet Union; (2) Two buffer states will be established between Germany and the Soviet Union: (a) "Little Poland" in the south, nominally an independent country but actually controlled by Germany, similar to the control of Slovakia; (b) Lithuania in the north, and the city of Vilnius will be returned to that country (Vilnius originally belonged to Lithuania, but was occupied by Poland in 1920). This division can be said to be a correction of the existing unfair situation on the surface, similar to Germany allowing Hungary to occupy Czechoslovakia's Carpathian Ruthenia province in March of this year. In addition, the Soviet Union will also invade and occupy Estonia and Latvia in the north (the Soviet Union has long coveted the ports of these countries on the Baltic Sea and can now achieve its wishes) and invade and occupy Romania's Bessarabia province in the south, controlling the Tatar Strait, in accordance with its traditional policy. From then on, the port of Istanbul in Turkey will no longer be controlled by Britain. (Havas, 16th)

Paris. The Soviet Union is stepping up its "partial mobilization" and sending a large army of 4 million men to the west as quickly as possible. Although the Soviet Union has not explained the reason for the concentration of the army in the west, it was generally believed here last night that this was a military preparation to ensure that the Soviet Union recovers and occupies the Ukrainian and Belarusian territories, which were ceded to Poland under the Treaty of Versailles. Polish sources here firmly believe that there is an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union to return this territory to the Soviet Union as the price for the Soviet Union's signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. It is widely believed that the territory the Soviet Union wants to return is barren, mostly swamps and difficult-to-pass valleys, with no oil, agriculture, or mineral resources. However, this area is a natural boundary between the Soviet Union and German-occupied Poland. (Associated Press, 16th)

Capital of Switzerland. Regarding the mobilization of the Soviet army, the correspondent of the Basler Abendzeitung in the Finnish capital recently reported that "Most of the reserves mobilized by the Soviet Union have been transferred to the Polish border. Only a small part has been sent to the borders of Estonia, Latvia, and Romania to strengthen the defense forces. The troops stationed on the Finnish border have not been strengthened. The capitals of various Eastern European countries believe that the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact does not involve the division of Poland, but only stipulates that the signatory countries have the obligation to consult each other. At this moment, the Soviet Union is probably preparing to consult with Germany. A certain diplomatic source in that country once declared, "Negotiations with German leader Hitler cannot be approached with a virgin's attitude. The Soviet government intends to transfer one-third of the Red Army to the Polish border, which is actually the preparation for the start of negotiations with Germany." (Havas, 16th)

Moscow. After the Soviet government implemented mobilization, the total number of army personnel has been raised to at least 4 million. All of the 1919 class of reserves and part of the 1918 class of reserves, totaling 600,000 men, have been called up. In addition, 145,000 young men from the 1920 and 1921 classes, who had previously had their enlistment deferred due to their studies, have also been enlisted. In recent days, another 800,000 reserves from various classes have been enlisted. Those who have completed their service period but continue to serve due to the tense international situation are not included in the calculation. Slogans are now posted in front of each barracks, boldly proclaiming, "We do not want to occupy an inch of other countries' territory, but we will never give up an inch of our own land." (Havas, 15th)

Berlin. Political figures here commented on the Soviet Union's plan to implement mobilization in the west, saying that since the meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Stalin, Germany and the Soviet Union have maintained close contact. The Soviet military delegation and the new Soviet ambassador have arrived in Berlin at the same time, but the content of the talks cannot be disclosed. (Haitong, 16th)

Paris. According to today's news from Eastern Europe received here, Poles and Romanians are extremely apprehensive about the Soviet Union's military actions on their borders and are paying close attention to them. Romania has urgently transferred troops to the Soviet border to strengthen its defenses, as Romania firmly believes that the Soviet Union has ambitions to covet Bessarabia. Poles also firmly believe that the Soviet Union hopes to restore the pre-war borders and incorporate Polish Belarus into its territory. (Associated Press, 16th)

Brussels, Belgium. The Belgian news agency recently received a message from its correspondent in Berlin stating that, according to German political figures, the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union has been defined by leader Hitler in his speech to the House of Representatives on the first of this month. In short, the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is a practical solution. In the future, Germany will not accept any international discussions on various European issues without the participation of the Soviet Union. Moreover, in the future, if the Soviet government can exclude Jews and not allow them to hold important positions, such as the dismissal of Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov, then that country's policy can be said to be closer to Germany's current policy. In short, if the Soviet Union can become a nationalist country and its domestic system is not related to the Third International, this political significance can be said to be that Germany and the Soviet Union have already reached a practical agreement. (Havas, 15th)

### German Economic Delegation Arrives in Bucharest Yesterday: To Negotiate New Trade Agreement

Bucharest, Romanian capital. German government economic advisor Klaus Clodius led an economic delegation to fly here today. He immediately issued a statement to the press saying that the German-Romanian trade agreement will expire on the first of next month, and both sides urgently need to negotiate new quotas for various export goods before the expiration. If there were no war, we would also come here, so this trip has no special significance. However, it is generally believed here that Clodius has come to purchase large quantities of food and raw materials from Romania. (Havas, 15th)

### Soviet-Turkish Negotiations Proceed Smoothly: Turkish Foreign Minister to Visit Soviet Capital

Rome. The Italian semi-official news agency today received a report from Istanbul stating that informed sources have learned that the purpose of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations is to sign a new agreement to eliminate foreign forces in the Black Sea. It is said that the negotiations are proceeding smoothly, and Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu will go to Moscow to sign a new agreement. The Italian news agency stated that serious obstacles have arisen in the negotiations between Britain and Turkey regarding a British credit loan of £7 million. It is said that the Turkish government hopes to borrow foreign currency, while Britain only wants Turkey to use the loan to purchase military supplies and is unwilling to pay in British pounds, resulting in a disagreement. (Haitong, 16th)

### Czech Ethnic Group Anti-German Activities: German Authorities Conduct Major Arrests

Prague. The German authorities have arrested a large number of reactionary elements in the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia.

The Hague. "De Telegraaf" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that the German Zeppelin airship is scheduled to fly back and forth between Germany and the Soviet Union in the near future, transporting German machinery and chemicals to the Soviet Union on the one hand and Soviet oil to Germany on the other.

### Polish Reserves Transported to Britain and France: Romania Allows Transit

Capital of Sweden. According to reports received here from the Romanian capital, it is possible that the reserves of the Polish Central Bank will be transported to London or Paris. The bank's director, Brica, is currently in Bucharest, negotiating with the Romanian authorities on the issue of transporting the reserves to Britain and France through Romania. It is said that the Romanian authorities believe that this matter has no impact on neutrality, so they will allow it to transit. (Haitong, 16th)

### Chinese Air Force Conducts Major Operations in Shanxi Province: Large Number of Chinese Aircraft Appear Over the Datong-Puzhou Railway, Bombing Concentrated Japanese Troops and Convoys

Chinese Air Force Plans to Maintain Strength of 500 Aircraft; Aircraft Manufacturing Plant Currently Being Established

Chongqing. The recent large-scale operations of the Chinese Air Force in Shanxi Province have attracted public attention. According to war reports from Shanxi Province, a large number of Chinese bombers appeared over the Datong-Puzhou Railway in southwestern Shanxi Province on September 8. Although they were subjected to intense anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese army, they were still able to descend and bomb concentrated Japanese troops and convoys, causing a large fire. On September 10, a train of Japanese troops traveling south on the Datong-Puzhou Railway was spotted by Chinese bombers, which immediately bombed it, destroying its engine and five carriages. It has been a year since Chinese aircraft conducted large-scale bombing operations. A year ago, Chinese aircraft bombed Japanese warships and transport ships in the Yangtze River downstream of Hankou almost every day, but then there was almost no news. In the past year, the commander of the Chinese Air Force has concentrated on training bomber crews and continuously importing new aircraft from abroad. Therefore, the resumption of activities by the Chinese Air Force has greatly excited the Chinese people here. (Reuters, 16th)

Chongqing. The "Military Affairs Monthly," published by the Military Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission, contains an article by former Chinese Air Force Commander General Qian Dajun, stating that the Chinese Air Force plans to maintain a frontline strength of 500 aircraft, which will require a total of 41.7 million yuan, with annual maintenance costs of 33.2 million yuan. He believes that once the Chinese Air Force has a frontline strength of 500 aircraft, it will be able to launch an air offensive and curb enemy aircraft activities in the Yangtze River and coastal areas. General Qian believes that replenishment will be based on an average loss of 40%, but the losses of the Chinese Air Force have not yet reached this figure. China is currently building aircraft manufacturing and repair plants, but it still needs to import some raw materials from abroad and develop the metal industry to assist in the manufacture of aircraft. As for bombs, machine guns, parachutes, etc., China can manufacture them itself. General Qian estimates that it takes ten years to train an aeronautical engineer and one and a half to three years to train a qualified air combat pilot. (Reuters, 16th)

### 2,000 Japanese Soldiers Annihilated in Conghua and Huaxian

A telegram from a certain location in northern Guangdong: This time, Japanese troops in Conghua and Huaxian were lured into attacking the two county towns. The Chinese army took the opportunity to annihilate 2,000 Japanese soldiers, including two company commanders. Two entire Japanese companies were annihilated. According to news from Guangzhou, there are more than a thousand boxes of cremated remains stacked at the Tianzi Wharf waiting for transport. The words "Triumphant Return" are written in large letters on the boxes. This battle was probably the largest loss suffered by the Japanese army since its invasion of southern China. The Japanese side has also admitted this without reservation. (15th)

### Fierce Fighting Continues Southwest of Huguan

Luoyang. The battle situation in Huguan is becoming increasingly fierce. On the morning of the 10th, a certain Chinese unit once occupied the Huguan city gate, but was eventually forced to retreat to the outskirts of the city gate due to excessive Japanese reinforcements. After paying a heavy price, they continued to attack. On the 11th, a unit of more than a thousand Japanese soldiers launched a fierce counterattack on the southern suburbs, while another unit of more than two thousand Japanese soldiers, under the cover of artillery fire that was insufficient, launched a diversionary attack on the Chinese right flank from Zejing Village in the east of the city, and then released poison gas. After a day of fierce fighting, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. On the morning of the 12th, fierce fighting continued southwest of Huguan. (16th)

Xingji. The Japanese army in Fencheng, after being repelled by the Chinese side from its westward attack on Mount Lüliang some days ago, again spied on Mabi Yu on the morning of the 11th with several tanks carrying more than 300 cavalrymen, advancing one way from Li Lao Zhuang and another way from Beidong Village.

### Major Victory for Chinese Army in Southern Hubei: Recapture Beigang and Saigongqiao; Annihilate 600 Japanese Soldiers and Destroy Regiment Headquarters

Pingjiang. It has now been learned that when the Chinese army in southern Hubei recaptured Beigang and Saigongqiao this time, in addition to annihilating more than 600 Japanese soldiers, they also destroyed a regimental headquarters of the Japanese Inaba Brigade, captured six Japanese soldiers alive, seized more than 60 rifles, more than 30 war horses, and many other spoils of war.

### Pravda Discusses the Quality of the Red Army

Moscow: Today is the first day for new recruits to the Red Army and Navy to enlist. Pravda published an editorial commenting: "The Soviet people have every right to recognize the Red Army and Navy as their glory. The foundation of the Red Army's power lies in the unity and friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. This year, there are 145,000 young people with secondary education among the new recruits of the Red Army. This is a powerful force. All regimental schools and special forces will increase the recruitment of new troops with high cultural and physical standards. These young people will be trained as reserve officers. There are no illiterates among the recruits this year, and many of them possess various special skills, such as tractor and combine drivers, technicians, and pilots. The number of Communist Party members, probationary party members, and Communist Youth League members enlisting this year is also greater than in previous years. Therefore, the Red Army will have a large number of new cadres, making its strength even stronger. This recruitment of new troops is conducted in accordance with the new universal conscription regulations, the purpose of which is to further enhance the Red Army's power and expand its numbers. All this is proof of Stalin's concern for the military organization of the socialist state. The world is now plunged into the heat of war, and many countries have been involved in the war. The Soviet Union and its armed forces must have full military preparedness to avoid being overwhelmed by the raging waves." (15th TASS dispatch)

### Wuxi Autumn Cocoon Prices Initially Rise, Then Decline

Wuxi Correspondence: Autumn cocoons in Wuxi have been on the market for some time. Generally, small family-run silk industries, seeing soaring silk prices and a lack of raw materials, went to the countryside to prepay deposits, agreeing orally to prices of 170 or 180 yuan per dan, or even 200 yuan. However, when the autumn silkworms were about to spin their cocoons, the European war broke out, and silk prices plummeted from 4,250 yuan to 2,700 yuan. Silk merchants in the family-run silk industry, upon receiving this news, convened meetings and decided that the highest price for autumn cocoons would be 90 yuan per zu, gradually lowering the price. At the same time, some cocoon merchants voluntarily abandoned their deposits for rented cocoon shops, while others regretted and reduced the contract price, creating a very chaotic situation. The silkworm farmers in the surrounding countryside, having spent 15 or 16 yuan per dan on mulberry leaves, feared that cocoon prices around 100 yuan would not only fail to cover labor costs but would also result in large losses, causing great panic. On the 8th, news arrived from Shanghai that silk prices had rebounded by 600 yuan, and 80% factory silk could be sold for 3,300 or 3,400 yuan. Therefore, silk and cocoon merchants regained their courage and went to the countryside to purchase cocoons. On the first day, the traded price using the Sima scale was 150 or 160 yuan per dan. Later, news came from Shanghai that silk prices had risen to 4,000 yuan, and cocoon merchants from all sides began bidding competitively. Prices on the southeast route reached 250 or 260 yuan, with traded prices around 220 yuan. Prices on the northwest route were above 200 yuan. Silkworm farmers in general were overjoyed. However, a telegram arrived from Shanghai the day before yesterday, stating that silk prices had fallen back by 700 or 800 yuan, and the silk market was at a standstill. Therefore, cocoon prices had declined by the 12th. The highest price in the southern countryside was still 240 or 250 yuan.

### Wartime Food Substitutes in Fujian Province: Overview of the Production and Sales of Dried Sweet Potatoes; Liancheng County Has the Highest Production

Fuzhou Correspondence: Liancheng is an important town in western Fujian, located at the center of Yongding, Ninghua, Tingzhou, Hangtou, and Longyan. The road network extends deep inland, making transportation very convenient. Handicraft industries, with paper as the main export, determine the prosperity or decline of the rural economy. Agricultural products are mainly rice, followed by sweet potatoes, which are the main supplementary food in the county. They can be made into dried sweet potatoes, which are famous throughout the eight prefectures of Fujian. Here is a brief description of their production and sales situation.

1.  Cultivation of Sweet Potatoes and Annual Harvest Volume: The raw material for making dried sweet potatoes is sweet potatoes, also known as mountain potatoes. It is a mistake to call them sweet potatoes, because although sweet potatoes are in the same family as sweet potatoes, they are another type of root crop. They can also be sliced and dried, but very few are produced in the county. The famous product is dried sweet potatoes. In addition to being made into dried sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes can be steamed, stir-fried, or made into noodles, dumplings, or ground into powder for cooking, or made into vermicelli, cooked and eaten to fill the stomach, and can also be used to make shochu, and can also be a good feed for livestock. Even the stems and leaves can be used as feed. There are three common methods for propagating sweet potatoes, which are described below: (1) Transplanting seedlings: First, loosen the soil, then apply fertilizer and dig holes, and then transplant the seedlings. The depth at which the seedlings are transplanted varies depending on the soil quality. Shallow transplanting is suitable for hard soil, and deeper transplanting is suitable for loose soil. Generally speaking, the soil should not be deeply cultivated, three or four inches is enough. If it is too deep, the roots will form in bundles and cannot expand, and the selling price will also be reduced. If sticky soil is encountered, it should be slightly deeper, to seven or eight inches, to suit its growth. This county often cultivates this crop in high ridges, one to prevent waterlogging and the other to facilitate harvesting. (2) Pulling seedlings: Plant sweet potatoes in the seedling bed. If the climate is suitable, buds and vines will grow within five or six days. When they grow to seven or eight inches, roots will grow, and they can be transplanted. When transplanting, dip the roots in mud to prevent drying. However, when pulling the seedlings, do not move the roots. After pulling, water immediately to keep the soil moist and attached. After two or three weeks, young shoots will grow again for propagation. This is the method of pulling seedlings for transplanting. (3) Inserting vines: The so-called method of inserting vines is that the sweet potato seedlings planted in the above method will grow vigorously in a few dozen days, and their stems can be cut off for transplanting. This method is the most common.

The planting season varies from place to place due to different climates, but generally it is carried out from ten days after the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar to the end of June. Harvesting is carried out from the end of October to November. During harvesting, the stems and leaves are cut off first, and then the sweet potatoes are dug out. The yield varies greatly depending on the coldness of the climate, the fertility of the land, and the amount of fertilizer applied. Some yield only ten dan per mu, while others can yield forty dan. Because of the shortage of rice in this county, planting is common everywhere. According to a survey in the 27th year of the Republic of China, the total output of the county was 40,000 dan, and less than 20% was used to make dried sweet potatoes.

2.  Method of Making Dried Sweet Potatoes: There are two methods for making dried sweet potatoes in this county, which are described separately below: (1) Whole-piece method: Take red-fleshed, white-skinned sweet potatoes, wash them clean, place them in a steamer to steam. After they are cooked, take them out and scrape off their skins, press them flat into pieces by hand, and then put them into bamboo cages and bake them over low heat until dry, and then they become red dried sweet potatoes. (2) Cut-strip method: Take red-fleshed, white-skinned sweet potatoes, wash them clean, peel them, cut them into strips, place them in a steamer to steam. After they are cooked, take them out and dry them in the sun, and then steam them again in a wooden steamer. They must be steamed and dried several times to become black-red sweet potatoes. Of the above two methods, the whole-piece method is more common, and more are exported.

3.  Nature and Uses of Dried Sweet Potatoes: There are two methods for making dried sweet potatoes, as described above. In terms of their nature, whole pieces are yellow in color and beautiful, sweet in taste, and shaped like joined fingers. Cut strips are brown in color, sweeter in taste than whole pieces, and very soft and glutinous. Both are easy to digest, and their greatest use is to replace food, which is beneficial and harmless to the body.

4.  Storage Methods: The storage methods for whole-piece and cut-strip dried sweet potatoes are different, which are described separately below: (1) Whole-piece storage method: Those that are newly made are not dried very thoroughly because the selling merchants want to maintain their weight, so they mold within two days of storage (turning white), and rot after a long time, because they often contain a lot of moisture. If you want to make them last, you must buy them back from the streets and alleys and bake them over a low heat until they contain no moisture. When eating them later, steam them in a rice steamer, and their taste and color will not change. (2) Cut-strip storage method: This type is more durable than the whole-piece type, because it has been steamed and dried several times, and the moisture is completely absorbed by the starch, and evaporated into a gelatinous substance, so there is no risk of spoilage if it is simply placed in a jar and sealed.

5.  Manufacturing Costs and Prices of Finished Products: Because sweet potatoes are very easy to plant and very abundant in harvest, the cost is low and the selling price is also cheap. According to a survey during the winter harvest season last year (late October to mid-November in the lunar calendar), 20 catties could be bought for every jiao, and every city dan only cost 5 jiao of national currency. After the harvest is completed, the price gradually rises. Those who make dried sweet potatoes purchase and store large quantities during the harvest period in order to manufacture them. Most of those engaged in this type of manufacturing are women. On average, each person can only make 10 to 15 catties per day. The selling price is one jiao per catty in winter and rises to 2 jiao and 5 fen per catty in spring. According to a survey, 100 catties of sweet potatoes can make 20 catties of dried sweet potatoes. Each catty is sold for one jiao, which can be sold for two yuan. In addition to the raw material cost of 5 jiao, the labor cost of 5 jiao, the fuel and miscellaneous expenses, and the damage to utensils, which are also calculated at 5 jiao, there is still a surplus of 5 jiao, which is quite profitable. During this time of war resistance, if we can universally promote and increase production, it will not only enrich the people's financial resources, but also increase the wartime food supply. It is suitable for use as military dry rations, which will be beneficial to the war of resistance and nation-building. Those who are concerned about the food problem should pay attention to this.

### Hong Kong on the Verge of War: A Situation That Has Moved from Crisis to Relaxation; Crowds of Refugees Come and Go Frequently

Hong Kong Correspondence: Japan's aggression against China has neither ended nor can it be sustained. At this stage, it is thinking of making things difficult for Britain, hoping to force Britain on the one hand to stop aiding China, on the other hand to "cooperate" with Britain, and on the other hand to force Britain to put pressure on the Chinese government to accept peace talks. As a result, the British concession in Tianjin suffered a blockade, and there were anti-British movements in the occupied areas. Finally, the Japanese army deployed troops on the border of Hong Kong, directly threatening Britain's only base in China. This happened after the 20th of last month. Under these circumstances, the British were outwardly calm, but inwardly very clear. Therefore, in addition to sending a large number of troops to the New Territories to increase defenses, and digging trenches on the Sino-British border, and blowing up the Shenzhen Weaver Bridge, they also publicly advised residents who could evacuate to do so voluntarily, and those who could not evacuate to store food in preparation for emergencies. In addition, they made various necessary preparations, such as the joint deployment of land, sea, and air forces throughout Hong Kong to establish a three-dimensional defense, the implementation of a blockade of Lei Yue Mun and Kap Shui Mun, and the promulgation of national defense laws and the implementation of postal and telecommunications inspections, and so on. During this period, the crisis in Hong Kong was in a state of great tension. However, like a thunderbolt, the Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression pact, and Japan suffered an unexpected and serious blow, causing it to panic. The first important thing seemed to be to quickly turn around and curry favor with Britain. In this way, the situation on the Shenzhen side gradually returned to relaxation, and the crisis in Hong Kong passed in this way.

However, with the deterioration of the situation in Germany and Poland, the foreigners in Hong Kong were the first to evacuate, followed by the Chinese who left Hong Kong, either to Yunnan or to Shanghai. Those without money had to make necessary preparations, so some stored food, some stored firewood, some took advantage of ships to Macau, and some simply fled to the occupied areas. Within three or four days, Hong Kong had surprisingly seen one or two thousand people fleeing. When the German-Polish war officially broke out, the atmosphere in Hong Kong became even more tense. Thousands of people fled by waterway to Shanghai, Macau, and Guangzhou, especially to Macau and Guangzhou. Those with more money went to the Philippines. Finally, those who could not escape immediately or had nowhere to escape also quickly stored food and bought firewood. Prices of canned food, milk, oatmeal, biscuits, salted fish, noodles, and the like soared immediately, and the work of withdrawing deposits, obtaining passports, inquiring about sailing dates, and booking cabins was naturally as urgent as fighting a fire. Therefore, within two days, Hong Kong society was in a state of chaos.

But after two days had passed, the situation seemed to have stabilized again after a period of turmoil. Japan's announcement of a "non-interference in European politics" policy was like giving the people of Hong Kong a reassurance. And in fact, it was true. As long as Japan does not act in concert with Germany and Italy, Hong Kong can stand outside the war. Although the Hong Kong authorities' war preparations since September 1 were very appropriate, by September 7, except for slightly higher prices and slightly affected commerce, there was simply no sign of any "war" in other aspects. Therefore, those who were planning to escape no longer wanted to escape, and some of the evacuated foreigners returned. More interestingly, while some people continued to flee to Macau, others continued to flee back from Macau. The reason was that Macau was small and densely populated, and could not accommodate so many "Hong Kong refugees" no matter what. Therefore, most of those who fled could not rent houses. At the same time, Macau used silver coins (old Guangdong silver coins) and Hong Kong dollars. In peacetime, one Hong Kong dollar could be exchanged for about 14 cents, so the cost of living in Macau was lower than in Hong Kong. But when the European war broke out, the price of silver coins continued to rise. One Hong Kong dollar could not even be exchanged for ten cents, so the goods there were more expensive than in Hong Kong. Therefore, those who fled had to flee back again. Some of those who had not fled but were planning to flee wanted to go but stopped, while others insisted on going to Macau to experience the taste of fleeing. In this way, the five ships that travel between Hong Kong and Macau every day are announced to be full, whether going or coming.

### Japanese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Unremittingly Engage in Anti-British Movement, Also Advocating Boycott of British Goods

Taixian dispatch: Japanese troops in Huaian city held a Pingju opera performance at the sports field a few days ago, taking the opportunity to conduct anti-British propaganda and advocate a boycott of British goods. Before the Pingju opera began, the traitor Sha Guizhang was active on the stage. A soft and hard plaque was erected on the stage, with the words "Thank the Imperial Army" written on it. Sha was wearing a dark green suit, a foreign-style straw hat, a Japanese sword around his waist, and a long red and yellow badge on his chest with the words "Huaian County Magistrate." He held an inauguration ceremony that morning, followed by a parade. His ugly behavior was shameful.

Japanese troops in Huaiyin, together with the puppet organization, have recently continued their anti-British movement. Yesterday, an anti-British rally was held at the public sports field in the city, forcing people to participate. Zheng Dazai, Huang Zihou, and Li Yushu were appointed as the presidium, with Japanese secret service chiefs and Japanese members of the pacification team monitoring from the sidelines. Only about 500 people, including attendees and members of the puppet organization, were present. After the meeting, they were forced to parade and shout slogans such as "Down with British Imperialism."

### Dinghai: Puppet Autonomous Association Disintegrates, Provisional Puppet Government Formed

Dinghai dispatch: After the fall of this county, the Japanese army immediately wooed local gentry to form a puppet "Autonomous Committee," with the Japanese person Kurashige Yasuyoshi as the chief advisor, Chen Ermei as the puppet supreme advisor, and Ding Zisheng as the puppet "Chairman." Some former county government employees were forced to join the puppet organization, but the former employees, understanding the greater good, took the opportunity to resign one after another and go to the interior. These included Chen Yunqing, the puppet "Chief of the Civil Affairs Section," Chen Yongkang, the "Chief of the Finance Section," and Wu Dingfu, the "Inspector of the Public Security Section," among others. They have all reported to the Zhejiang provincial authorities on their forced participation in the puppet organization. Recently, the puppet association has announced its disintegration due to intense suspicion and friction among the factions. The Japanese are planning to organize a "Provisional Unified Government," but the members are complicated, and suspicion among the factions is intensifying. All "secretaries," including Wang Menglu, have been dismissed, and the puppet "Chairman," Ding Zisheng, has also been detained at the former site of the Suoshan Cooperative by the Japanese naval command.

### Hua Army in Lilizhen, Wujiang, Strategically Captures Puppet Troops, Disarming More Than Two Hundred People

Suzhou dispatch: A certain unit of the Hua Army stationed in Lilizhen, Wujiang, recently found the puppet troops to be exceptionally cunning and difficult to attack. To implement a thorough suppression plan, they feigned surrender on the 8th. At that time, Xie Zhijun, the commander of the puppet troops in Wujiang, believed it to be true and, seeing that the Hua Army intended to negotiate, sent more than two hundred puppet troops, led by a company commander, to Lilizhen, hoping to be incorporated. Unexpectedly, the Hua Army, seeing the puppet troops arriving in large numbers, had ambushed them near the town. When the puppet troops landed, at a signal, they were surrounded from all sides. The puppet troops then realized they had been tricked but were no longer prepared. They shouted, "Chinese people don't fight Chinese people," and were willing to surrender with their weapons. A certain officer of the Hua Army, considering the puppet troops to be fickle, refused to accept their surrender. The seized weapons were reported to the superiors, and the captured puppet troops were forced to disband to avoid further disturbing the local area.

### Sino-French National Institute of Technology: No Turmoil or Confusion

Recently, someone, under the name of the School Protection Committee of the Sino-French National Institute of Technology, published various remarks in a certain newspaper. According to a statement from all the students of the school, all the students have made a solemn statement that they will unanimously obey the government. The school also has absolutely no brewing turmoil or falling into a state of confusion. The statements published in the newspaper are all unfounded rumors and are obviously deliberately fabricated by those with ulterior motives to incite discord in order to trap the school in a desperate situation and achieve their conspiracy to embezzle it.

### Senior Singles Semifinals: Li Guofan Lost to Carson Yesterday: Carson Wins Straight Sets to Gain the Right to the Finals and Will Compete with Wang Wenzheng for the Championship

In the senior singles semi-final of lawn tennis, Carson played against Li Guofan at the French Chamber of Commerce field yesterday afternoon in light rain. Carson, who dominates Shanghai, has rarely met his match. Yesterday, he still maintained his championship posture, long strokes and short blocks, all of which were handy. The forehand was powerful and accurate. Li was ultimately not as good and lacked experience. Sometimes he could not calmly handle the situation and missed many good opportunities. Therefore, the whole game was controlled by Carson. Li suffered a crushing defeat in straight sets. However, Li is a promising newcomer. He was first added to the senior division this year and was able to defeat strong opponents and enter the semi-final week, which is a fairly satisfactory result. The future is long. With more hard work, it will not be difficult to become a famous general. Failure is the mother of success. May Mr. Li encourage himself. With Carson eliminating Li Guofan to win the right to the finals, he will compete with Wang Wenzheng for the championship. The results of yesterday's game are as follows:

### Finance: Hong Kong Group Takes Out Foreign Exchange to Buy Gold: Unofficial Afternoon Price Reaches 4260 Yuan

Although the trend of foreign exchange was stable and firm in yesterday's spot gold dark market, the price of gold continued to rise. This was because the Hong Kong group squeezed out foreign exchange and transferred it to gold, so the price of gold and foreign exchange have been moving in opposite directions recently. Therefore, the settlement price of foreign exchange was slightly rolled up, but according to the noon closing calculation, it was still lower by a huge 782.8 yuan to 1196.8 yuan. However, the situation on that day was still flat at the opening in the morning, remaining at 4130 yuan. After the opening, because the buying interest of the customer group was very strong, the price immediately soared to a high of 4220 yuan. After that, a certain Yu number and the silver shop group took advantage of the high price to sell, and money changers absorbed it whenever it was small. The two sides held each other, so the price rarely changed, hovering around 4200 yuan. As a result, the noon closing price was 4190 yuan, an increase of 60 yuan compared with the previous day. In the afternoon, because there was no market on Saturday, the off-market situation was even stronger. It is reported that the unofficial price reached as high as 4260 yuan. Trading was brisk for half a day, at around a thousand taels. The silver and gold shop together hung up 15 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold are in a fixed state.

Spot Gold Market Price Rises Sharply

From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial opening was still flat, the market opened at 9:10, money changers mutually traded two taels, the price was still 4130 yuan. Russian money changers were very interested in buying, and the Hong Kong group entrusted the securities group to absorb it, and there was a temporary disappearance of sellers, resulting in a sudden surge. In an instant, it rose by 90 yuan, the securities group bought 30 taels in total from the money changers and the silver shop group, all at 4220 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop and a certain silver shop came to take advantage of the high price to sell, and it was heard that foreign exchange was firm, and buyers turned to sell, so it immediately fell back 40 yuan. A certain gold shop sold 20 taels to the money changers, the price was 4180 yuan. Later, the money changers continued to absorb purchases on behalf of the local group, and then raised it again by 30 yuan, the money changers bought 30 taels from the silver shop group, for 4210 yuan. After that, the cash number suddenly came to spit out, and the silver shop group continued to sell, causing the price to fall back 40 yuan again. The silver shop group sold 10 taels each to the money changers and the securities group, and the price was 4170 yuan each. Before long, it suddenly rose again, the silver shop group mutually traded 20 taels, the price was 4200 yuan. At noon, it slightly fell back down, the silver shop group spat out 20 taels to the money changers, and 4190 yuan was the noon closing price, up 60 yuan compared with the previous day. It has been rising for six consecutive days, with a total increase of 405 yuan. The first half of the day had a high-low of 90 yuan, not breaking the range. There was no market for delivery in the afternoon. It was heard that the buying interest of the Hong Kong group outside the market suddenly strengthened, and the price had risen to 4260 yuan. The selling price of the cash number's own brand gold is 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price is 50 yuan lower than the selling price. The current price of gold is 60 yuan lower than the price, and there is a request to hear the transaction.

Ornament Gold Hanged High at 430 Yuan

The exchange of silver shop jewelry gold per tael also followed the trend of rising non-stop. Datonghang initially hung at 415 yuan, and at 9:30, it jumped up 10 yuan to 425 yuan. At 3:00 in the afternoon, it rose another 5 yuan to 430 yuan. Xinhang also stepped up to 428 yuan. (The purchase price is reduced by about 20 yuan.)

### Gold Pound Reaches 100 Yuan

Yesterday, foreign currencies had little fluctuation because the exchange market was less volatile, so British and American gold notes did not rise or fall. However, the price of gold continued to rise, and the wealthy had a great demand for gold pounds, so the rise was particularly strong. The former has already reached the 100 yuan mark, and the latter has crossed the 100 yuan mark. As a result, each rose by 4 yuan, the French franc note also rose by one point, Singapore currency rose by one jiao, the Dutch note rose by five jiao, the Japanese gold note rose sharply again, once reaching 1.335 yuan, finally 1.33 yuan, an increase of 4.5%. The Korean currency rose by 2.5%, but the Annamese currency fell by 2 jiao, and the rest remained stable.

### Oversupply of Cash Notes: Discount Rate Continues to Decline

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange and bill notes was still in the low range, because the supply of cash notes exceeded the demand, and each thousand yuan initially hovered around 125 yuan, then retreated to 122 yuan, and near noon rose back to 125 yuan. In the afternoon, it once fell to 117 yuan, and finally was 110 yuan, down 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate of the Money Industry Association was still 20 cents.

### Sterling Weakening, US Dollar Stable

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. In the unofficial market, the British and American exchange rate plummeted, shrinking by another five points to $3.88. Therefore, the morning opening showed continued weakness in sterling and strength in the US dollar, with sterling gold at 4 pence 0.015625 and the US dollar falling to $6.4375. However, the market was very dull midway, with very little trading, as operators were waiting to see what would happen. Due to the recent surge in commodity prices, many speculators in the foreign exchange market have turned to other opportunities, resulting in a booming stock market. However, due to some selling by Hong Kong interests, sterling gold closed firmer at 4 pence 0.03125 at noon, and the US dollar recovered to $6.50, slightly firmer than the previous day for sterling but unchanged for the US dollar. The trend for this month's futures was similar to the spot market.

Further Shrinkage in US-British Exchange Rate

At the beginning of the morning, the recent London cable rate rose by 0.0625, the forward rate rose by 0.05625, the New York silver price rose by 0.025, and London gold remained unchanged. The exchange rates for sterling against the US dollar, Shanghai dollar, and French franc were all flat (with prices but no market). The US dollar fell sharply again by 0.05 against sterling, fell by 0.30 against Shanghai dollar, and fell slightly by 0.015 against French franc. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling price for spot transactions at banks in the morning was 4 pence 0.015625 for sterling gold and $6.46875 for the US dollar, which was 0.03125 lower for sterling and higher for the US dollar compared to the previous close, due to the fall in the exchange rate. After the opening, a certain bank absorbed spot US dollars from another bank at $6.50, which was relatively stable. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there was no change, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be up by 0.035. After that, Hong Kong interests entrusted brokers to release some spot sterling gold, and Chinese merchants also slightly dumped US dollars, but British banks and HSBC had good appetite, so the loosening trend was minimal. Hong Kong interests sold spot sterling gold to HSBC and other foreign banks at 4 pence 0.03225 and 0.0625, and Chinese merchants sold spot US dollars to foreign banks at $6.50. Thereafter, fewer transactions took place, and the process was uneventful. Near noon, foreign banks showed some willingness to sell spot US dollars at $6.50. By noon, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 pence 0.03125 for sterling gold and $6.50 for the US dollar. This month's sterling gold was 4 pence and the US dollar was $6.4375. As a result, the current month's sterling average was slightly up by 0.015625, while the US dollar was unchanged. In the afternoon, the market was closed on Saturday.

Hong Kong US Dollar Continues to Tighten

Spot sterling weakened slightly by 0.03125 to 3 pence 0.46875. The unofficial price of "Joint Notes" rose slightly by $0.50 to $88.

### Securities: Fluctuations in Domestic Bonds, Wider Range, Vigorous Foreign Stock Market

Yesterday's unofficial securities market saw a trend of weakness followed by firmness, but after rebounding, it seemed to lack momentum, ultimately failing to break out of the sideways pattern. However, the difference between highs and lows was slightly larger than in previous days. While it had been fluctuating between 0.05 and 0.10, yesterday's fluctuations were between 0.30 and 0.40. Class C bonds fluctuated around $43. Since September 2, this situation has not changed. Yesterday, there was also news of a ceasefire agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union regarding Manchuria and Mongolia. The market's reaction to this move was uncertain. Trading by various interests remained light. Generally speaking, Class C bonds were firmer and Class E bonds were weaker. Market sentiment remained stable. At the end of the day, prices were mixed, with a difference of only 0.05 to 0.20. The total turnover was around $300,000. Next Monday is a holiday, and the market will be closed for one day.

In stock trading, 20 shares of the Third Factory were traded at a price of $15.50.

Furthermore, the Public Brokers Association reported that the prices of various stocks soared yesterday, and the public was eager to obtain them. Each transaction saw higher prices, and a vigorous atmosphere permeated the market. Speculation in steel stocks became active again, with a fierce upward trend reaching $8.20. However, other industrial stocks were generally stable and firm. Rubber stocks with a high degree of liquidity were widely sought after, and no one was willing to let go, resulting in several stocks showing a continuous upward trend. Although, based on any standard, the intrinsic value of rubber stocks was still significantly suppressed, the market's current trajectory may be interrupted at any time, and it is expected that those who profit can take advantage of the situation to exit. Preferred shares of the power company were difficult to obtain, and there were buyers at a price of $123 at closing.

A London telegram from the 15th reports that the listed prices of Far East British companies' stocks remained low, with more declines than increases.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Mills Tend to Reduce Work, Cotton Yarn Rises and Falls Sharply, Double Horse Once Opened at $860, Ten Count "De Li" Rose by $55

The yarn market is increasingly showing a trend of rapid rise and fall, with the situation being exceptionally volatile. The market is filled with rumors, with most people believing that the price of raw cotton is high, inventories are dwindling, foreign prices are becoming more expensive, and mills with insufficient cotton are deeply concerned about the possibility of reducing work, which will weaken future production. The two British companies have already implemented a three-day shift system. As a result, buyers rushed in, causing the price of 20-count Double Horse to reach a new record of $860. In an instant, as those who profited sold off, the price quickly fell by $30. The price of warehouse receipts fluctuated, with the peak reaching $785 and falling back slightly to $755. This situation is startling and frightening. Hong Kong has a strong demand for 10-count coarse yarn, so the price of coarse yarn is rising even more. The price of 10-count "De Li" soared by a huge $55.

The morning opening price of existing yarn was up because the Indian cotton telegram showed a rise of more than ten rupees, while American cotton was flat. Market sentiment was extremely hot. The opening price of Xie Ma jumped by $57, but the spot price was slower, rising by $20 to $30. After a while, due to the sharp rise in recent days, those who profited came to sell, and the price fell back by $20 to $30. The closing price was flat. According to statistics, 960 bales were traded in half a day, compared to 300 bales traded on the previous day. The Shenxin No. 2 Factory announced the confirmed opening of 500 bales of 20-count "Tian Nu" today, priced at $800, with a deposit of $100 per bale. The market prices were: 20-count Double Horse rose by $16, Double Globe rose by $26, Tian Nu rose by $28, Xing Shi jumped by $70, Mu Yang rose by $36, 10-count Double Globe rose by $25, and "De Li" rose by $55. Yesterday, 480 pieces of export cotton yarn were shipped to Ningbo, and today, 75 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by various interests is listed on the left:

Hong Kong　300　Counterparts　515

Inland　95　Ningbo　50

### Tong Cotton Demanding a Price of $160

Spot cotton trading has been developing continuously, and various mills are eagerly searching for supplies. The available goods on the market are being sold out day by day. Overseas quotations are extremely high. Although the momentum of American cotton was flat and weak today, Indian cotton prices have risen sharply because of reduced inventories and weak arrivals from the mainland. The price of white cotton for delivery in April and May jumped by seventeen rupees. The unofficial telegram continued to show a rise of ten rupees. As a result, market sentiment was stronger, and selling prices advanced step by step. The price of Tong cotton rose again by $7. The raw material for Indian cotton 30-count yarn has reached $197 to $200. High-quality Tongzhou cotton is demanding a price of $160. According to market news, it is rumored that foreign factories are considering reducing work due to the difficulty in finding raw materials. The source from northern Jiangsu is estimated to be 500 to 600 bales of Tong cotton, and 850 bales from Beisha. 190 bales were exported to Hong Kong. The situation of spot cotton is listed on the left:

Yesterday's price of American-type Pengpu cotton was $180, which was mistakenly recorded as white cotton. This is corrected.

Another news item reports that the trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is tight because the inventory in Shanghai is dwindling, so the selling price is unusually tight. Counterparts are unwilling to sell. Some factories, seeing this situation, have already started ordering new cotton from foreign firms. However, the ship schedules are very far away, all in September and October. In recent days, tens of thousands of bales have been sold. Most of the traders are Japanese manufacturers. It is generally expected that American cotton trading will become prosperous and the Indian market price will continue to soar.

The Market Price of Foreign Cotton: The New York cotton market was very active in the early morning due to buying pressure, and the opening price rose sharply by 6 or 7 pounds. Subsequently, the market fell due to public selling and strong buying in the South. As a result, the closing price fell by 5 or 6 pounds compared to yesterday. The Indian cotton market has seen soaring prices due to difficult imports and low inventories in the producing areas. Yesterday, the combined forecast jumped by 18 rupees. The Egyptian cotton market was quieter, with a slight increase of 7 or 8 pounds. Liverpool rose by more than 20 pounds.

### Grains: Flour and Wheat Loosen

The flour market is slightly looser because it is the weekend. There has been no special progress in trading by local merchants. Since the recent dumping of products from Japanese factories on the market, some merchants are happy to buy them, so the factory flour has been quite impacted. Yesterday's return of goods for both hoarding and actual sales was flat, and the price has loosened slightly by a few cents, with a price opening of $7.225 to $7.23. The factory price is still $7.20 cash, temporarily unchanged. The future market will depend on the actual sales. On the 17th, 16,200 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.

Wheat continues to be oversupplied. Arrivals from various regions have been continuous in recent days. The factories' appetite is still good, but the merchants' and hoarders' destocking has gradually slowed down. At present, sellers of high-quality goods are still trying to hold on, but medium-quality wheat has already loosened. Only 6,000 bags of wheat from Suchang Zhenyang, Wuhu, etc., jointly run by Fuxin and Fufeng factories, were traded in the market at a price of $10.05 to $9.55. High-quality wheat hoarders are watching and hesitating, and there is little trading, so the market is difficult to boost.

### Early and Late Rice Continue to Fall, Glutinous Rice Stabilizes

Yesterday, there were no arrivals from He Xia, but 3,000 to 4,000 bags of new goods from Jiashan, Jiaxing, Kunshan, and Suzhou arrived by wagon. The overall market from the early morning still had some residual momentum from yesterday, and market sentiment continued to be good. The prices of various goods were again trying to be raised. Later, due to the loosening of sales, the supply exceeded demand, and the situation became weak. The prices of various goods gradually fell back. As a result, both early and late rice fell by $0.50 to $1.50. For example, special grade Jing was $43, high grade was $41 to $42, settled at $40, Suzhou-Tong-Kun Jing was priced at $11 to $40, He Xia early and late rice was $35, settled at $33, original package was $38 to $37.50. New Suzhou-Kun Yang sharp rice opened at $29.23, later falling to $28.70 to $28.50. Feng Jing Ling Bai sharp rice, as a fresh product, was priced at $29.50. New Jiaxing-Jiashan Yang sharp rice was $29 to $28.23, Tuan sharp rice was $29 to $28.50. Old goods of Wuhu sharp rice were not as popular as new goods, so they were priced at only $27, new sharp rice opened at $28, later to $27.50, settled at $26 to $27. New Jiangbei sharp rice was $28 to $27.50, Bian Yuan was $37 to $38, Ocean glutinous rice was high at $38.50 to $38. It is estimated that only about 5,000 bags were traded in the city.

Another news item reports that yesterday morning, merchants took advantage of the rising wind of the previous morning and the increased costs due to the release of rice that had been blocked, so sellers raised prices by $0.50 to $1.00 at one point. However, buyers hesitated due to the high prices, and merchants also planned to seize the opportunity to sell quickly. As a result, the market stopped rising and then weakened again. The market was very weak later, and the price decreased slightly by about $1, which was about $0.50 less than the previous market. High-quality Jiangbei late rice was $28, high-quality Wuhu late rice was $28.50, and medium-grade settled at $27 to $25.

### Sugar Market: Hoarders Continue to Release, Foreign Sugar Remains Soft

Yesterday, the foreign sugar market continued to be weak due to hoarders continuing to release their stocks. The association's clearing price for spot No. 24 crude white sugar in the local warehouse fell to $57.30, and the minimum price in foreign warehouses was $56.50. The market was slightly better at $77, the transit price was $45, Taikoo refined white sugar was flat at the beginning and then weakened, falling from $62 to $6.80, and then to $61.20. The rest of the CW mark and other marks were retreated according to prices. H mark red sugar was $45.20 spot and $29 transit, down slightly by $1. Ben Mian Bai Zhen Ji No. 1 was $57, No. 2 was $56.50, No. 3 was $56, and No. 4 was $55.50. Ben No. 1 crystal sugar was $66.50, Jingming crystal sugar was $68. The trend of domestic sugar remained firm, with no transactions. However, 3,000 bags of sugar were shipped to Ningbo yesterday.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rises Frequently

The port sales of soybean oil have not continued due to exchange rates. (Peanut oil has not yet opened). Driven by the environment, the scalper-style hoarders are very active, causing the market to continue to advance to new highs. Yesterday, the market rose again by $1 to $2, and Kobe oil resurfaced to the $60 mark (opening at $60.80). The record high of the 22nd of last month ($61) is bound to be broken. Total market turnover was 30 barrels of Dalian oil, 120 barrels and 50 cans of Kobe oil, 10 barrels and 165 cans of Tianjin oil, 20 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, and 120 pieces of Qingqi oil. The market prices are detailed in the market price column. As for export oil, 690 pieces of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong today.

700 bags of soybeans arrived from Beisha on the 16th, and 2,850 bags were shipped to Hong Kong on the 17th. 650 bags of raw peanuts were shipped to Hong Kong on the 17th.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods Repeatedly Create High Prices

Eastern piece goods rose sharply yesterday, with the cash discount rate decreasing, and merchants' intention to trade became more active. The rising momentum was still strong, and new high prices emerged one after another. The spot price of "Long Tou" fine cloth was $12.60 per piece, and the futures price for next month was $23.75. The price of "La Ba" fine cloth for this month was $11, and for next month was $22. The current market price of "Yang He" fine cloth also required $21.50. Merchants have ordered more than 700 pieces of fine cloth. Dyeing factories in this street and Tianjin merchants purchased 500 to 600 pieces of spot fine cloth and fine twill. The market generally lacked supply. The price of colored "Si Jun Zi" broadcloth was $0.72 per yard for delivery next month, creating a new record never seen before.

Regarding exports, 520 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Ningbo on the 16th, 370 pieces to Hong Kong on the 17th, and 160 pieces to Haiphong.

### Overcoating Cloth: Low-End Goods are in Short Supply

The market for overcoating cloth has been unusually expensive recently, as the source of supply is lacking, and the exchange rate for all bills of exchange is around 4 pence, resulting in high costs. The selling price of ordinary overcoating cloth, which used to sell for $5 to $6 per yard, has now risen to $10 per yard. There is a severe shortage of these thick goods in both local and foreign warehouses, and the market is particularly tight. Looking at future arrivals, (1) most of the counterparts are telegraphing for slow loading, (2) the number of ships from Europe is limited, and (3) the forced use of "Huaxing" notes for tax payment has further increased the cost, resulting in strong market sentiment.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Yarn Trading is Not Active

Yesterday's silk market saw New York's recent price rise by 0.125 and the forward price by 0.13, spot raw silk rose by 0.03, Yokohama rose by $10, and the forward price rose by $75. However, foreign firms in Shanghai were not actively purchasing, as the recent rise in silk prices in Japan and the United States has been too drastic and erratic. American sales of Reeled Silk No. 6 opened at $1,900, a drop of $150 compared to the high price. White Factory B word traders held the price at $4,300. It is said that Shao Chengwen only sold 45 piculs of Reeled Silk No. 4 yesterday.

### Northern and Southern Goods: New Hunan Lotus Seeds Initially Rise by More Than $10

Since the arrival of new Hunan lotus seeds, the lowest price of lotus seeds from this lake once broke the $100 mark, a drop of more than one-third compared to the initial price. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining a source and the scarcity of arrivals, the price turned around. Yesterday, it opened up more than $10 to $110, and the market is gradually stabilizing.

### Top Grade Lily Buds

Lily buds have seen a turnaround recently, and the top grade of good goods has been firm and tight. Top grade has reached a high price of $50, and has now reopened to $52. However, the price of middle and low grade goods has only risen by $2 to $3.

### Hardware: Counterparts and Hoarders Search for Purchases, Prices Rise Frequently

Hardware prices have been rising continuously, as European goods cannot be shipped, and only American goods can monopolize the hardware market in Shanghai. Unfortunately, there are few ships, freight rates have risen, and war risk insurance has increased. The factories have repeatedly decided to raise prices, and counterparts cannot order goods. In the future, the arrival of hardware will be scarce. Counterparts and outsiders are competing to purchase, and hoarders are absorbing and hoarding for speculation, causing the market prices of various goods to skyrocket. Yesterday, the price of 24-gauge large Malacca tinplate opened at $1,000 per box, the price of 26-gauge opened at $500, the price of 100-pound genuine Double Speed tinplate opened at $240, the price of 90-pound opened at $220, the price of Company Steel opened at $170, the price of pig lead opened at $750, the price of blue lead opened at $120, the price of local nails opened at $60, the price of black iron billets opened at $1,000, the price of new lead wire opened at $90, and the price of white lead wire opened at $50, all of which have soared by 10 to 20 percent compared to the previous price.

### Ribbed Steel Bars - Selling Prices Also High

The largest outlet for ribbed steel bars is the construction industry in this street, and there is a lack of outlets for merchants. Tianjin is flooded due to floods, so there is no intention to purchase. Qingdao and Yantai merchants have also not started purchasing due to ship schedules and blockades. Although merchants in southern China have made some purchases, the number is very small. Therefore, the only reliance for these goods is the corner of Shanghai. The opening price is only seen to rise day by day. At present, the market price is $760 per ton for 3/8 inch to 4/8 inch and $710 per ton for 5/8 inch to 1 inch. Other market prices are attached below (unit: yuan)

### Medicinal Materials: High Quality Galangal Soars Again

Galangal is divided into three types: large, medium, and small. At present, the producing area is controlled by a certain party, and it is necessary to settle the purchase of foreign exchange before allowing export. Moreover, ship fares and other expenses are very expensive, so the Shanghai pharmaceutical companies have to raise prices again. The current market price is more than $14 to $15 higher than the previous market price. Moreover, Hankou merchants are also moving, so the future market is expected to continue to rise. It is estimated that there are only 300 to 400 pieces in stock in the market.

### Imports and Exports - European Goods Recently Arrived in Shanghai

Recently, goods arriving in Shanghai include 3,361 pieces and 200 pieces of Italian Lianlai Qing, 250 boxes of woolen cloth, and 30 pieces of pigments. However, 35 pieces of rayon were transferred to Tianjin. The day before yesterday (the 13th), 5,079 bags of foreign rice were transported from Hong Kong, and 370 bags of soybeans were transported from Beisha. Also, on the 14th, 2,150 bags of soybeans were exported to Hong Kong and 770 bags were exported to Xiamen. 50 pieces of soybean oil were also exported to Xiamen. 100 pieces of soybean oil were also shipped to Hong Kong, and 700 bags of raw peanuts and 1,990 cans of raw oil were transported.

In addition, 32 pieces of tea, 38 pieces of cloth, and 3,500 pieces of native paper were transported to Tianjin. Also, 500 pieces of native paper and 115 pieces of piece goods were transported to Yantai.

### General Medhurst Returns to Shanghai, Closely Watching the Situation, Conferring with Consul General Gauss for Careful Response; Negotiations in Western Shanghai Reportedly Nearing Conclusion

After the outbreak of the European war, the Japanese took the opportunity to exert pressure on the two concessions. On the 6th, they demanded that Britain and France withdraw their troops stationed in China. On the 8th, they supported the puppet police and began to encroach on the extraterritorial roads. On the 13th, they demanded that the commanders of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai change their defense zones. On the 6th, a Japanese naval spokesman told a Western newspaper reporter that "necessary steps will be taken according to the decision," which has been staged one by one. As a result, the situation in Shanghai is becoming increasingly serious. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council has conducted negotiations with the Japanese on the extraterritorial roads, the Japanese actions are still in full swing. Rear Admiral Medhurst, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, to whom the U.S. government has granted broad powers regarding Far Eastern issues, had just returned to Qingdao from Shanghai when he was ordered to quickly take his private yacht, the Isabel, to Shanghai at 11:30 the previous morning to contact various parties and respond to the serious situation. It is expected that there will be major developments within a day or two. The detailed situation is recorded below:

Medhurst's Actions Are Highly Significant

U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson is far away in Chongqing and does not intend to come to Shanghai. Regarding Far Eastern issues and Shanghai issues, the U.S. government and Ambassador Johnson have granted broad powers to Rear Admiral Medhurst, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet stationed in Qingdao, and Consul General Gauss stationed in Shanghai, instructing them to closely monitor the development of the situation. Any event that involves U.S. interests in Shanghai or is sufficient to weaken U.S. interests in the Far East will be handled carefully by the two gentlemen in accordance with the government's consistent foreign policy, maintaining contact with British and French officials stationed in Shanghai. It is reported that Rear Admiral Medhurst visited Mr. Gauss the afternoon of the day before yesterday after arriving in Shanghai to listen to various information and exchange opinions. A counterproposal will be put forward regarding the Japanese request to change the defense zone for reference by the commanders of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai. The authorities of various countries stationed in Shanghai also look to the United States for guidance in dealing with the various difficult issues at hand. Therefore, Medhurst's actions are highly significant.

Japanese Coveting British Military District

After Commander Shishido of the Japanese Marine Corps convened a meeting of the commanders of the British, American, and other countries' defense forces to request adjustments to the troop defense zones, it was widely rumored in the Zhabei area that the Japanese would follow the example of the area from North Jiangxi Road to North Sichuan Road, block the area west of North Jiangxi Road to North Xizang Road, and place it under Japanese control. Residents in the area would be issued permits by the Japanese within a time limit, and Japanese troops would be stationed at the Zilaishui Bridge, Tianhou Palace Bridge, Shanxi Road Bridge, Fujian Road Bridge, Old Garbage Bridge, and New Garbage Bridge to check permits and epidemic prevention certificates, etc. Whether this claim is true regarding the British garrison in Zhabei is temporarily impossible to confirm, but the rumors of the Japanese attempt to take over the British defense zone seem not without cause.

American Radio Station Broadcasts Absurd News

The *Continental Daily News* reported that when the American Golden Gate Broadcasting Station broadcast news last night (the 15th), it claimed that the Shanghai British military authorities had received an order to withdraw from the British military defense zone in western Shanghai within a month, etc. Those in this port who listened to this broadcast news were greatly shocked. However, it has been proven that this statement is completely absurd. Upon further inquiry, both British and Japanese authorities categorically denied it. The Japanese naval spokesman also agreed with the British embassy spokesman's statement that "this statement is completely untrue." It should be noted that the Golden Gate Broadcasting Station has broadcast inaccurate news for the third time in less than two weeks. The previous two times, it reported that the U.S. authorities, in view of the "emergency" situation caused by the Japanese demands on the Shanghai Public Concession, had dispatched the U.S. 6th Marine Regiment to Shanghai, and that the French army had broken through the German Siegfried Line on the second day of fighting on the Western Front.

Phillips Visited Chuanchiawong

Regarding the negotiations on the extraterritorial roads, the reporter heard the day before yesterday that Phillips, Chairman and Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, would meet with Japanese representatives on that day to continue negotiations. This was confirmed yesterday morning. That afternoon, Mr. Phillips did meet with Japanese representatives to exchange views on general issues in a private capacity, but no concrete results were obtained. Yesterday, the Japanese newspapers reported that Mr. Phillips visited the puppet mayor Chuanchiawong in the downtown area at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, and had a 50-minute talk on the extraterritorial road issue in western Shanghai, which had achieved a "satisfactory solution." However, the spokesman of the Shanghai Municipal Council is not prepared to comment on this.

The *China Press* reported that according to the Japanese *Shanghai Continental Daily News*, Mr. Phillips, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, met with "Mayor Chuan Chia-an" at the "Municipal Government" office in the downtown area at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 15th). As a result, the extraterritorial road issue is expected to be satisfactorily resolved. Today (the 16th), it was heard that Mr. Phillips is not prepared to make any comments on this.

The Western Shanghai Robbery Is Reported to Have a Background

At about 7 p.m. the day before yesterday, three Chinese constables of the Jing'an Temple station were robbed of three pistols while patrolling near the Wujiaochang in Caojiadu. There are many rumors that the constables were disarmed. According to nearby residents, this happened at 7:10 p.m. that evening, when three Chinese constables were patrolling on Jessfield Road, sixteen people suddenly rushed out at the corner of Jessfield Road and Connaught Road, surrounding the three. The three fought bravely, but due to the disparity in numbers, the pistols they carried were robbed. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled into the gambling den area on the side of the road and disappeared. The police station, upon receiving the report, dispatched two armored vehicles to search the area, but found nothing. This incident occurred in the eventful extraterritorial road construction, and the thugs openly formed gangs and carried weapons. Moreover, the weapons they carried were Mauser rifles and box cannons. All parties believe that this act must have a background.

The Police Station Began Preparations Yesterday

The Lin Mansion at No. 448 Haig Road (west of Difeng Road) has been actively engaged in preparations since it was occupied by Japanese military police and puppet police on the 13th. On the one hand, the existing wire mesh along the road was completely dismantled, and on the other hand, workers were hired to repair the houses. The work has been very busy in recent days. Yesterday, sandbags were piled up in front of the main gate and side gate to build fortifications. Some of the puppet police guarding the gate placed their guns on the sandbags in a radiating manner, and the situation appeared somewhat serious. The police station also dispatched armored vehicles and bicycle teams from yesterday onwards to patrol from time to time, and extra detectives were assigned to guard the entrances and exits of various roads in case of emergencies.

The Japanese Continue to Build Fortifications

No. 11 Jessfield Road has been occupied by the Japanese puppets for a week now. In recent days, defensive works have continued to be built. Yesterday, circular holes were dug along the ground on the walls on both sides of the gate, leading to the sand fortresses built outside, and wire mesh was added to the sides of the sand fortresses to increase defensive strength. Six puppet police officers are still guarding the gate. Very few Japanese puppets enter or leave. The number of people stationed inside seemed to have decreased yesterday.

Detectives Search Passing Pedestrians

The Qiu Pu at No. 15 Jessfield Road and the area around Kangjia Bridge and Jinjia Lane are still guarded by puppet police posts, and the situation is the same as in the past. The fortresses at the gate of the Japanese military police Western District Command and the puppet police branch on Malu Bridge are being actively built by the Japanese military police, who are transporting bricks and stones. As for Caojiadu, after the pistols carried by the constables at the post were robbed by thugs the day before yesterday, the police station dispatched an armored vehicle to patrol the area yesterday. Detectives were also increased in the Robison Road area, and pedestrians were searched, and the situation became tense again.

### New Stamps Worth Ten Yuan Specifically for Parcel Post, Already Delivered to Shanghai Post Office for Distribution

The Shanghai Postal Administration has received a new type of stamp worth ten yuan with the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen from the Directorate General of Posts. The above stamps are printed by the Hong Kong China Bookstore, which is briefly called the Hong Kong version. It is known that the highest face value of the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen stamps has always been five yuan. Currently, due to the annual increase in postage for parcel delivery, the post office has printed them to meet the needs of senders. In addition, the Hong Kong version of Dr. Sun Yat-sen stamps with a face value of two fen has been sold in the mainland, and they are also printed in Hong Kong. However, the Shanghai Post Office has not yet sold them.

### Japanese Navy Declares Blockade of Wenzhou Bay, Effective 7 p.m. Today, Notification Given to Third Countries

Transportation between Shanghai and Wenzhou has recently been often inconvenient due to the actions of the Japanese Navy. It was learned yesterday that the Japanese side recently informed diplomatic officials and customs officials of third countries through the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai that, according to the decision of the Commander of the Fleet in China, Wenzhou Bay will be blocked effective 7 p.m. today (the 17th), and obstacles will be placed. The blocked areas are: (1) the waterway on the west side of Weiao Mountain; (2) the vicinity of the 270-degree line of the Ni Reef datum point; (3) the vicinity of the connecting line between Xiaowuxing Island and the northeastern end of Hutou Island, etc.

### Tribute Rice Continues to Be Sold at Low Prices, Efforts to Maintain Order; Yesterday, Common People Scrambled to Buy Rice, One Elderly Woman Trampled to Death

Yesterday was the first day of the tribute rice sale. Although the sale time was stipulated to start at 8 a.m., the common people who bought rice arrived as early as 5 a.m. yesterday morning, carrying baskets and burdens, waiting at the entrances of various sales locations. After 8 a.m., the average number of people in each district was more than two or three thousand. It is estimated that (District 1) 100 bags of rice were sold out at 2 p.m.; (District 2) the first batch of 100 bags was sold out at noon, and another 100 bags were issued in the afternoon, which were also sold out at about 2 p.m., and then another 100 bags were issued, which had not been sold out by 4 p.m., and the civilians refused to disperse, and the matter was not completed until 7 p.m.; (District 2) 100 bags were sold out at noon, and sales were announced to be suspended in the afternoon due to poor order; (District 4) sales were also suspended in the afternoon due to crowding and tragedy; (District 5) 100 bags were sold out at noon, and the order was the best there.

Tragedy Occurs in District 4 Rice Sales

The Shandong Guild Hall at No. 249 Ximen Road, French Concession, was managed by the Shanghai Rice Industry Association and various groups as the fourth sales location, which held the sales at 8 a.m. yesterday. However, at this time of serious rice shortage, before the time arrived, five or six thousand people had gathered, with old and young, mixed knowledge, scrambling to be first and disobeying order, and unfortunately a tragedy occurred as a result.

Too Many People Rush In

Although the sales were stipulated to start at 8 a.m., some people went to wait before dawn. Before 8 a.m., the number of people gathered more and more. At that time, there were only three Indian constables, two Chinese police chiefs, and two on-duty Chinese constables, who were unable to maintain order. Therefore, those at the front had crowded to the door. At the same time, students from the Qilu School attached to the Shandong Guild Hall were going to school, and the public took the opportunity to rush in, about three hundred people. The police quickly closed the iron gate, but the number of people outside the gate was large, and the large iron gate on the front of the Shandong Guild Hall suddenly opened, causing those standing at the front to be pushed to the ground, crying for help, and the order was thrown into chaos.

Pushed Higher and Higher

Moreover, there were many people, pushing higher and higher, and the cries shook the sky. Although the few police officers and sales personnel present tried their best to rescue them, they were of no avail. The police station was notified and sent a large number of detectives to break the siege. However, the ribs of an elderly woman in her sixties at the bottom were broken, and she was barely breathing. She was sent to the hospital and died of her injuries shortly after. There were also two brothers from Hangzhou who were seriously injured in the chest, one Tong Jinsheng, 28 years old, and one Tong Asan, 26 years old, who lived at No. 778 Kangdi Road, Malang Road, and a local woman, Lu Tang, 36 years old, who lived at No. 67 Changyuan Lane, Yangjia Lane, Pushi Road, who injured her chest and waist.

Sold Out in Less Than Three Hours

In addition, there were countless minor injuries, head injuries, loss of money, and damaged clothes. Mr. Yu Qiaqing received the news, drove to the scene to inquire and express his condolences, and sighed deeply. The discounted rice was sold out in less than three hours, and a notice was posted at the gate stating that the discounted rice had been sold out and would be sold again at 8 a.m. tomorrow. However, those who had not purchased it gathered at the gate and did not disperse until late. A small number of those who had purchased rice tickets but had not yet received the rice were allowed to continue to collect the rice today after being signed and certified by the sales staff.

Other Districts Also Had Injuries Yesterday. Although there were detectives to assist in maintaining order at various sales locations yesterday, the number of people was too crowded and they jostled each other, resulting in the tragedy in District 4 at the Shandong Guild Hall. In District 1 on Beihainan Road, the straw shed that had been built was pushed over by the crowd yesterday morning, and the wooden fences in front of the door were also broken. Although the location of the straw shed on Carter Road was wider, only the wooden fences were broken. In the third district, the Jade Buddha Temple, a civilian was also squeezed and injured yesterday morning. In the second district, at the intersection of Carter Road, someone was injured at about 2 p.m.

Mr. Yu Qiaqing Was Very Concerned

Mr. Yu Qiaqing said, "This sale is because the quality of the rice is quite good, and the selling price is 20 yuan per picul, so the general public is scrambling to buy it. It was originally set to have five sales locations in the two concessions, with a limit of 100 bags per location per day. However, the current situation is obviously absolutely insufficient, so it has been decided not to add restrictions, and to sell all 8,000 bags of discounted rice. Regarding the sales situation yesterday, the purchasers were too crowded. In order to avoid similar incidents from happening in the future, each sales location will block the entrances and exits so that purchasers can enter and exit according to the decision, so as to avoid rushing and squeezing. As for the Jade Buddha Temple and other sales locations, it was discovered yesterday that many refugees went to buy rice. These refugees have rations supplied in the shelters, and the rising rice prices have not affected them at all. The purpose of buying rice seems to be to make a profit. If they are allowed to buy discounted rice, the purpose of running the discounted sale will be lost, so they have been stopped. After this, we will continue to order tribute rice and run the discounted sale. Currently, all parties are still in progress.

Rice Prices Fell by One Yuan Yesterday

Yesterday, the total number of rice registered by cargo owners with the Rice Market Management Committee was 6,429 bags. The market transactions were still light. Also, because yesterday was the day when the sale of tribute rice started, the market was affected by it, and the price of rice fell by one yuan. The highest price of indica rice was 28 yuan per picul. Because there were no transactions for japonica rice, the price did not change. According to the management committee member, tomorrow is the "September 18th" anniversary, and the market should be closed as usual, but in view of the Shanghai rice market situation, which is not stable, the market will not be closed tomorrow either. After the lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, the market has also decided to open as usual on Sundays.

### Newsprint Supply Is Assured; Large Shipments from Norway Arrive in Shanghai

After the outbreak of the German-Polish war, the prices of foreign goods soared. The price of newsprint, in particular, soared even faster. Normally, each ream was sold for only six or seven yuan, but now it has reached a selling price of more than thirty yuan, which has greatly affected newspapers, bookstores, and all printing businesses. It is learned that a large batch of newsprint previously ordered from Europe by Shanghai merchants has now arrived in Shanghai one after another, and prices may be lowered. It is learned that the Norwegian merchant ship Talleyrand, loaded with a large batch of newsprint, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. Helmspey, also fully loaded with newsprint, is currently en route and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 20th. It is also heard that a German ship was also carrying a large amount of newsprint to Shanghai when the German-Polish war broke out, but was subsequently seized near Singapore.

### German Merchants Still Agree to Deliver Goods According to Orders from Chinese Customers; Blindly Raising Prices May Lead to Regret; Speculators and Hoarders Should Be Aware

After the war, Shanghai's interior benefited from a large influx of funds, resulting in a gradual increase in funds. However, due to the lack of proper channels for utilization, the rise of speculative businesses has been created, such as foreign exchange arbitrage, foreign currency gold securities trading, and the hoarding of various commodities, which has caused the prices in the concessions to soar and the abnormal development of industry. This development is not only detrimental to the stability of Shanghai's financial market, but also runs counter to the government's wartime financial policies. Since the outbreak of the European War, the prices of all goods from Britain, Germany, and France have gradually soared, with some rising more than tenfold. The most significant increases have been in pigments, foreign needles, foreign wool, hardware, Western medicine, and coal. Among the pigments, black carbon black has risen from 90 yuan per dan to more than 1,000 yuan. Foreign needles, such as Lihe needles, have risen from 60 yuan per 10,000 to 160 yuan. Newsprint has risen from 7 yuan per ream to 26 yuan. The main reason is that in this chaotic situation, buyers fear that the source of goods will become less and less, while sellers expect huge profits.

The general public, with no knowledge, in view of the wealth that was made during the last European War, regardless of Shanghai's inventory and future actual sales, desperately engaged in hoarding. Various foreign firms, factories, and companies took the opportunity to raise prices, creating this abnormal phenomenon. However, the livelihood of the general public has been greatly affected. It should be known that China is now in a period of resistance against Japan, which is different from China during the last European War. Moreover, the last European War lasted for several years, which was indeed due to the depletion of inventory. The above-mentioned phenomenon occurred within three to five days of the outbreak of this European War. Currently, the inventory of British, German, and French goods in China is still sufficient, and the source has not been completely cut off. For example, two German cargo ships carrying pigments and foreign needles from Germany to China were blocked in Japan, but they have now been unloaded and reloaded onto Japanese ships and will arrive in Shanghai soon. At the same time, German goods have been loaded onto neutral country ships and are sailing to China. It is heard that the Danish ship King, loaded with foreign paper, hardware, etc., will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of this month. Therefore, European goods will still be able to come to China. The various German firms in Shanghai still agree to deliver goods according to orders from Chinese merchants and will not cancel orders due to the European War. Therefore, it is hoped that speculators and hoarders of foreign goods who seek to profit will have a considerable awareness to avoid regrets in the future. At the same time, the prices in Shanghai will not rise abnormally again, and the livelihood of the people can be slightly stabilized.

### German Ships Plan to Try Sailing to Eastern Zhejiang; Hana Returns Safely to Shanghai; Shanghai-Wenzhou Freight Gradually Smooths

Since the outbreak of the European War, there has been concern about whether the German merchant ships sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line can continue to sail. The companies themselves have also been hesitant to make a decision. After careful consideration by the shipping department of Lihe Company, it was believed that sailing within three nautical miles of neutral territorial waters would not be affected. Therefore, the Moufu ship decided to sail from Zhenhai to Shanghai on the 14th and arrived safely in port on the 15th.

Hana Returns to Shanghai Safely

It is learned that the Hana ship of the German Far East Company also returned to Shanghai the night before last and arrived at Jinliyuan Wharf yesterday morning. According to the ship's crew, the situation along the way was very safe. The above two ships are still planning to sail as usual, but the date of departure has not yet been determined. It is heard that the Haifu ship will also sail to Shanghai on a scheduled date after loading is completed.

Shanghai-Wenzhou Freight Gradually Smooths

The Shanghai-Wenzhou route has been blocked for a long time, and all freight has been suspended. After the British Xin Anli ship successfully returned to Shanghai after a trial voyage a few days ago, the British Xinxiangtai, represented by Taichangxiang, and the Shen'ai and Shenfu ships of Yilong Foreign Company have successively continued to sail to Wenzhou and have arrived in Wenzhou to load and unload goods. Also, the Shenyou ship of Yilong Foreign Company is scheduled to set sail to Wenzhou today. The Yongtai Marler ship of the British Far East Shipping Company is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Wenzhou on September 19. The Shenyou ship of the British Yilong Company arrived in Shanghai from Yantai the day before yesterday and is also scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou this morning. However, all ships are currently only loading cargo and not carrying passengers. Therefore, Shanghai-Wenzhou freight has gradually become smooth.

Gaodeng Sails to Haimen Jinchang Port

According to the reporter of Daguan News Agency's inquiries to the shipping industry, navigation to Haimen in eastern Zhejiang has been cut off for nearly half a year since the Chinese military authorities implemented a blockade. It is learned that the Gaodeng ship of the German Lulin Company is now planning to try sailing to Jinchang Port in Haimen, also limited to loading cargo. However, the date of departure has not yet been determined.

### Two Concessions Jointly on Alert This Morning; Chinese and Western Detectives Deployed to Inspect Pedestrians; Extra Precautions Taken in Extraterritorial Sections of Western Shanghai

The police authorities of the two concessions, in view of tomorrow being the "September 18th" anniversary, have decided to start joint preparations this morning. Extra precautions are being taken in the western Shanghai area. Details are recorded as follows:

Joint Preparations Begin This Morning

Tomorrow is the eighth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, which is about to arrive in the blink of an eye. In order to prevent any untoward incidents, the police authorities of the two concessions have banned all gatherings since the 13th and will begin special preparations today. Patrol teams composed of Chinese, Western, Russian, Vietnamese, and Indian detectives will conduct inspections of pedestrians and vehicles in their respective districts, and armored vehicles will patrol the various roads. However, no obstacles have been placed on the various roads.

Western Shanghai Takes More Stringent Precautions

The Wujiaochang area in western Shanghai had an incident a few days ago in which thugs robbed three pistols from constables of the Public Concession. Therefore, the authorities are paying special attention to this matter. Starting yesterday, the Jing'an Temple, Gordon Road, and Pudu Road police stations dispatched additional detectives to step up precautions in the western Shanghai area. In addition to setting up double posts, vehicle patrol teams and patrol teams are also stepping up patrols, paying attention to Jing'an Temple Road, Jessfield Road, Yu Garden Road, Route Tenant de la Tour, Connaught Road, Anhua Temple Road, Singapore Road, and other roads. The French Concession is also taking extra precautions in the Xujiahui area.

### Shanghai Postal Administration Restricts Postal Money Orders to Jiangsu Province; Additional Water Fee Collected in Various Places; Amount of Drafts Appropriately Reduced

In order to restrict postal money orders in various parts of Jiangsu Province, the Shanghai Postal Administration has increased the exchange fee. The method is to increase the water fee by one point per yuan for those who previously only charged the exchange fee and did not add the water fee, and increase the water fee from two points to three points for those who previously charged the water fee. The amount of the exchange has also been appropriately reduced to show the restriction.

### Import and Export Volumes of Japanese Goods in August Both Decreased Compared to July; Main Export Item Is Ancient Bottles

Recently, although Shanghai's trade with Japan has not had precise statistics due to various reasons, the types of imports and exports have also changed considerably compared to before the war. According to customs information, the import and export volumes of Japanese goods in Shanghai in August both decreased compared to July. The import was 53,395 tons, of which the import of chemical industrial drugs was drastically reduced. The major import items were wood, cement, and newsprint, and soft drinks and beer even reached more than 3,000 tons. Textile machines and parts were 600 tons, of which fresh fish and salted vegetables were 700 tons, and wild tea was more than 1,400 tons. As for exports to Japan in August, it was only more than 10,000 tons, of which the main export item was ancient bottles, accounting for more than 5,000 tons, which can be said to have created a new pattern in Sino-Japanese trade. Silk cocoons were only more than 100 tons, flax was 10 tons, and wheat bean cake ranked first in exports to Japan, at more than 4,000 tons. From this recent situation of Shanghai's Sino-Japanese trade, a rough overview can be seen.

### Not All European Refugees Are Prohibited from Coming to Shanghai; Consensus Among All Parties; Effective After Approval

The *China Press* reported that a meeting continued to be held at the Japanese Consulate yesterday (the 15th) regarding the entry of European refugees into Shanghai. The proposals put forward by the Japanese Consulate representative after studying the proposals of the Shanghai Municipal Council were considered, and a draft interim agreement was drawn up to prevent the complete prohibition of the entry of European refugees into Shanghai, which took a further step. There was indeed no conflict of opinion between the proposals of the representatives of the Japanese Consulate and the Shanghai Municipal Council. Representatives of the French authorities and the local Jewish Committee have also approved the proposals. The agreed agreement is now awaiting approval by the relevant standing authorities to see if it can be implemented.

### Temporary Business Registration Certificates: Do Not Issue Indiscriminately; Industry Associations Themselves Shall Be Held Responsible for False Certification

The Ministry of Economic Affairs notified the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating: Upon investigation, according to the regulations in the first section of the first clause of the "Provisional Measures for Commercial Registration in Shanghai," when applying for temporary registration, a certificate should be issued by the local trade association for the relevant industry. Additionally, according to the second clause of the same article, those issuing certificates regarding whether a commercial establishment's registration involves circumstances under Article 21 of the Commercial Registration Law should solemnly declare their willingness to bear legal responsibility. Recently, Shanghai industry associations have often failed to conduct detailed investigations of fellow businesses applying for certificates, simply issuing them without verifying that there is no misuse of other businesses' names. This not only violates regulations, but also places the associations themselves at risk of being held responsible for the crime of false certification. Therefore, it is necessary to inform all industry associations to pay close attention and not issue certificates indiscriminately. Furthermore, a report on the handling of this matter must be submitted promptly.

### Counselor of the French Embassy, Roux, Departs for America

According to the English-language "China Press," Roux, the counselor of the French Embassy in China, due to health reasons, departed this morning (the 16th) by ship, traveling via America to return to France for recuperation.

### Yesterday's High Tide in the Huangpu River Caused Sewer Backflow, Receding Only at 5 PM; Continued High Tides Expected Today and Tomorrow

Due to weather conditions, the tide in the Huangpu River has experienced continuous high tides since the 11th, averaging over ten feet. Yesterday, due to stronger southeasterly winds, around 2 PM, the tide caused backflow from the sewers, leading to water accumulation on low-lying roads such as Caishi Street, Yinhua Street, Zhejiang Road, Guangxi Road, Nanjing Road, and Route Lafayette, ranging from three to five inches to over a foot deep. The water only began to recede around 5 PM. However, the Caojiadu area remained flooded up to the ankles. According to a report from the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau, this high tide will persist until the 20th. Aside from today and tomorrow (the 17th and 18th), which will be similar to yesterday, the remaining days will only see tides around ten feet, and the roads are not expected to flood.

### Increased International Telegram Fees at Various Telegraph Offices; Separate Rates for Soviet Telegrams; Chinese Telegrams to Hong Kong Refused

The Great Northern and Eastern Extension Telegraph Companies in Shanghai have recently increased their rates for telegrams sent from Shanghai to various European countries. While they are still receiving and sending telegrams as usual, the fees have increased several times over. According to a source at the telegraph office who spoke with a reporter from Da Guang Press yesterday, telegrams to Europe now cost 8.65 yuan in national currency per word (including countries such as England, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, and Belgium). The Soviet Union is an exception to this. Telegrams to New York in the United States now cost 11.20 yuan in national currency per word (other locations in the United States are an exception). Telegrams to Hong Kong, which previously cost 0.14 yuan per word in Chinese and 0.28 yuan per word in English, are now refusing to accept Chinese, only accepting clear English text at 0.70 yuan per word.

### Shenzhou Hotel Searched Yesterday

The Shenzhou Hotel on Fuzhou Road and Zhejiang Road was searched by the Police Department at approximately 9 PM last night. The operation involved two red police armored vehicles, the White Russian volunteer corps, and over seventy detectives, who surrounded and secured the hotel, temporarily prohibiting passage. Inside the hotel, detectives from the Police Department searched individual rooms, ordering all guests to remain in their rooms and refrain from any movement. Luggage and belongings were thoroughly inspected. The operation concluded and forces withdrew around 10 PM. It is understood that nothing was found. However, to safeguard the security of the city, public places and busy areas will be under close surveillance within the next few days, and all pedestrians and vehicles will be inspected.

### Minimal Impact on Silk Exports After Outbreak of European War; Although Most Shipping Routes Are Obstructed, Silk Goods Can Still Be Sold to India and the Americas

The French-language "Journal de Shanghai" reported on the 6th that since the outbreak of the European war, the Shanghai silk market has been somewhat disrupted, but silk prices have not fallen significantly, and the market conditions remain largely normal. Although transportation between Shanghai and Europe is mostly obstructed now, Shanghai silk can still be sold to places like India and the Americas, so there is no immediate cause for panic. Furthermore, since June, silk exports have totaled 15,583 bales, compared to 7,927 bales during the same period last year.

### Landlords Continue to Raise Rents on Properties in the Bustling Nanjing Road Area; Over Fifty Businesses Firmly Reject

The properties located west of Shiliu Road and east of Daxin Street (i.e., Hubei Road) along the north side of Nanjing Road belong to the Yu Xing Real Estate Company. The buildings are over twenty years old and rents have been raised several times. In January of this year, another rent increase was mediated, resulting in tenants paying additional water fees, settling rent obligations in cash rather than entirely through remittances, and establishing a rent increase agreement to ensure mutual commitment and avoid further disputes. However, recently, prices for all goods in Shanghai have soared, and landlords, seeing an opportunity, are eager to increase rents, disregarding the burdens on businesses. The Yu Xing Real Estate Company has demanded that its tenants, including over fifty well-known shops such as the Zhonghua Store, Sanxing Cotton and Iron Factory, Tongchunxiang Cotton Cloth Store, Sanyou Industrial Society, Xiangya Company, Da Zhonghua Electric Company, and Hefeng Woolen Company, increase their rents by as much as 30% to 40% of the original rent. These shops, which have been tenants for over ten years, upon receiving the notice, jointly protested that the ink on the rent increase agreement was barely dry. They argued that the claim of low original rent, increased land value, and high construction material costs was insatiable and unreasonable, and they unanimously rejected the demands. Seeing their desires thwarted, the company hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit against the tenants in the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment ordering the defendants to increase their rents by 30% to 40% starting from August 1st of this year, for a period of twenty months. The tenants also hired lawyers Zhang Henghai, Zhang Yuji, Ma Zhenzong, and Lin Dewen to present their defense based on facts and legal principles, arguing that the buildings were old, the styles were outdated, and any damage was repaired by the tenants themselves. Furthermore, the increased land valuation by the Municipal Council was purely due to the Council's tax policies and could not be used as a reason for rent increases. They also cited successful previous court judgments for rent reductions following the January 28th and August 13th incidents, as well as precedents set by the Supreme Court regarding rent increases and reductions, requesting the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims and the bearing of litigation costs. Yesterday morning, Judge Ni Zheng'ao convened the parties for a hearing in the Third Civil Court. First, the lawyer representing the plaintiff, Mr. Wang, stated the plaintiff's case. Then, he announced that nine tenants had already reached settlements outside of court and requested permission to withdraw the lawsuits against those nine tenants. Additionally, lawyers representing two other tenants reached settlements with the plaintiff in court. The lawyers representing the remaining tenants, including Tongchunxiang, then vehemently argued that, according to civil law, landlords must demonstrate an increase in land value to justify rent increases. Shanghai's commercial sector had been severely damaged by the two previous wars, and the real estate value had only decreased. Furthermore, rent had already been increased this year, and a written agreement was in place. To demand another increase just half a year later was unreasonable and unjust, and the tenants could not accept it. They requested the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims and the suspension of the case, as two other tenants had previously been involved in a lawsuit regarding the plaintiff's rent increase, and that case was currently under appeal. This case shared the same facts and should be considered after the appellate judgment was final. Judge Ni then adjourned the hearing to a later date for further review. As for the two tenants who agreed to the rent increase and reached a settlement in court, they had close ties with the landlord and did not act in unison with the others.

### Commercial Temporary Registration Approved for Eleven Businesses

The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently approved temporary commercial registration in Shanghai for eleven businesses, including the Huamei Chemical Industrial Manufacturing Factory, Yan Yan Industrial Cooperative, Sanyu Weaving Factory, etc. Their business scope, capital amount, names and addresses of principals or partners, location, and registration notice numbers are all being published in the eighth issue of the "Commercial Monthly Report" in accordance with ministry orders.

### News from Tianjin Flood: Rising Prices and Impoverished People Facing Starvation and Cold

The tragic situation of the Tianjin flood is truly shocking. Millions of people are homeless, and the area between Beiping and Baoding has become a large lake, inundating fourteen counties. Epidemics are rampant, with numerous cases reported. Aid is urgently needed, and delays may prove fatal. Mr. Ou Yongkang, the general manager of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, gave a statement yesterday, of which a summary is provided here. Mr. Ou stated that the flood originated from incessant rain in the first half of August.

The Hai River (i.e., the Bai River) saw its water level rise to the top of the dikes on August 16th, and they soon breached. The authorities of the Tianjin concessions quickly constructed temporary earthen embankments around the city to defend against the flood. These new embankments were made of sandbags filled with soil, four feet high and six feet wide, using a total of two million bags. However, these embankments were only effective for a short time. On the afternoon of August 20th, they were breached, with the floodwaters first entering the British concession, then the Japanese concession, and finally the French concession at 8 PM. All the lights went out, and residents could only struggle in the darkness. By morning, the bustling streets had turned into waterways, with water depths reaching fifteen feet. Transportation relied entirely on small boats, with some using wooden basins or window planks. Cars were nowhere to be seen. The British concession has now been able to restore electricity, but the French concession has not yet recovered. The disaster victims in Tianjin are living on the water, suffering extreme hardship. Floating corpses are seen daily, and many suffer from leg ulcers. Hospitals have no space to accommodate them. The railways are shut down, making it impossible to evacuate the victims. Prices have skyrocketed, with rice costing 50 yuan per bag and flour costing 20 yuan per sack. The wealthy can only afford steamed buns, porridge, and salted vegetables, while the poor cannot even think about food. The floodwaters show no signs of receding. According to the Hai River Engineering Association, it may not recede for two months, as the siltation outside the Dagu Port is worsening and the Yongding River's water volume has also increased. The losses from this flood are incalculable. Finally, Mr. Ou stated that the association had already remitted 20,000 yuan to Tianjin several days ago, but this amount was small and had limited effect. They must continue to raise funds and hope that all sectors of society will provide generous donations, continuously delivering them to the association's office at 97 Renji Road. The chairman of the relief association is Mr. Song Hanzhang, and the Western chairman is Father Raoul de Jaegher.

### Another Handgun Robbery of Two Chinese Detectives on Yidingpan Road; Appears to Be a Planned Action

The Yidingpan Road area on Route Tenant in Shanghai's western district is under extra-territoriality jurisdiction, bandits have been rampant lately, and the residents are in fear. The concession police authorities have been dispatching patrol teams day and night to patrol the area. At around 8 PM last night, two Chinese detectives from the Jing'an Temple police station, numbers 225 and 2810, were patrolling along Yidingpan Road when suddenly eight thugs swarmed forward and robbed the two detectives of their service handguns from their waists. Although the Chinese detectives struggled with all their might, they were outnumbered and disarmed. The bandits fled into the darkness, making it impossible to pursue and arrest them. The detectives returned to the police station to report the incident. It is understood that a similar incident occurred in Caojiadu the day before. It appears that these bandits are acting according to a planned strategy.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Approves Import of Goods; Products from Shanghai's Domestic Goods Manufacturers Ordered to Be Inspected and Released

### Zhending Company Sued for Breach of Contract; Appeal Concluded, Awaiting Judgment; Jiang Liwu and Others Only Agreed to Refund the Deposit; Appellee Requested Maintenance of the Original Judgment

Lawyer Wang Liwu, formerly partnered with local individuals Han Ouping and Bi Desheng to establish the Zhending Company in the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road (Wang was the general manager, and Han was the assistant manager). They were previously sued in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court by Teng Zijin, an employee of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, for breach of contract and failure to deliver a property on time. The court found the claim to be true and ordered the defendants, Wang Liwu and others, to jointly deliver the property within two months. If they were unable to deliver the property, they would have to double the original deposit and pay a penalty of 1,400 yuan. Details have been reported in this newspaper. The defendants, dissatisfied with the initial judgment, filed an appeal with the Civil Court of the Third Branch of the Higher Court. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Xia Jinde, accompanied by Judges Wang and Tan, convened the Third Civil Court to hear the case. First, the appellants, Wang Liwu and Bi Desheng, stated their reasons for disagreeing with the original judgment, claiming that they admitted to refunding the appellee's deposit of 620 yuan but requested the dismissal of the remaining claims. They stated that Zhending Company had actually leased land on Fulili Road from individuals surnamed Xu, Huang, and Shen, and they submitted the lease agreement, the Municipal Council's survey documents, and accounting records for inspection. However, because the Municipal Council did not issue a permit, they were unable to proceed with construction. Furthermore, the contract stated that if a permit was not issued, the contract should be canceled. The court asked how much capital the company had, and Bi replied that he had personally invested 5,000 yuan, and the other participants had each pledged 1,000 yuan per share, but although they said so, they had not paid. Han Zhengping was represented by a lawyer who stated the reasons for disagreeing with the initial judgment. The appellee, Teng Zijin, was represented by lawyer Zhou Zhenhua who claimed that the appellee had previously purchased a property at 16 Zhengping Village, Fulili Road, from the appellants, and had paid a deposit of 700 yuan, and the property was to be delivered on September 15th, 1938. The appellants failed to deliver it on time, clearly breaching the contract. Upon reviewing the land lease agreement submitted by the appellants, it was only a draft. They had only paid a portion of the deposit and had not formally entered into a contract. Since a formal contract had not been established, how could they have entered into a contract with the appellee? Furthermore, upon reviewing the appellant's accounting records, they appeared brand new and contained the notation "discounted." Since the appellants were a large company building thousands of houses, they must have had dealings with banks. Why did they only discount at a money shop?

Additionally, the appellee's lawyer had inquired with the Municipal Council and found that the appellants had only requested the Municipal Council to survey the land and had not applied for a permit. Furthermore, if their capital was only 5,000 yuan, but they were building thousands of houses, costing 2,000 yuan per house, then a thousand houses would require two million yuan. It was clear that they were setting up a shell company with only 5,000 yuan in capital building thousands of houses. He requested the court to take note of this, uphold the original judgment, and dismiss the appeal. After the court reviewed the arguments, it declared the debate concluded and scheduled the judgment for the 20th of this month.

### Seditious Leaflets

At around 8:30 PM last night, someone suddenly distributed a large number of multi-colored leaflets on the rooftop garden of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road and Yuchiaking Road. The content of the leaflets was extremely seditious and outrageous, such as "[...] in the September 18th national awakening movement, we are determined to expel the white people to establish the foundation for East Asian self-awareness and self-determination," and "commemorating September 18th, we will implement cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria." The police station dispatched officers to collect and file the leaflets for investigation.

### Apprentice Embezzles Funds Meant for Remittance, Squandering Them; Joy Turns to Sorrow as All Three Accomplices Face Imprisonment

Bian Weibingrong, of Rongfeng Cotton Cloth Store, 34, Lane 31, Shanxi Road, entrusted his apprentice, Tian Haizhou, from Shaoxing (18 years old), with a check for 1,000 yuan and 3,985 yuan in legal currency on the 8th of this month to remit to the Chunyuan Money Exchange. Tian harbored malicious intentions and did not remit the funds. After embezzling the money and fleeing, he met with his friends Yuan Gengsheng from Henan and Gong Gengfu from Shanghai in room 300 at the Paramount Hotel on Yuyuan Road. Besides using the embezzled funds to purchase three diamond rings, three watches, and various fabrics and items, he engaged in gambling in various gambling dens in western Shanghai and sought pleasure with female guides. Wei Bingrong did not report the incident to the police station. However, the incident was discovered by Chinese detectives Huang Hairu and Zhu Xinwu of the General Police Station. On the morning of the day before yesterday, they first arrested Yuan Gengsheng at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road, and then proceeded to the Paramount Hotel to arrest Gong.

They recovered 1,445 yuan in cash, as well as diamond rings, watches, fabrics, and bedding, and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, charged them with embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, all the defendants confessed without denying. The court sentenced Tian, Yuan, and Gong to one year of imprisonment each as a warning. The stolen goods were returned to the plaintiff.

### Opening of National Goods United Distribution Center Scheduled

Various domestic goods organizations and factories in this city, due to the market being flooded with foreign goods and the sales of domestic goods being crowded out over the years, see the recent outbreak of the European war and the soaring prices of foreign goods as a good opportunity to promote the domestic goods industry. Therefore, they specially organized the National Goods Manufacturers United Distribution Center, scheduled to open on Double Ten Day. The location is at 356-358 Nanjing Road, and the building will be completed soon. Internally, it is divided into various departments, including silk and satin, cloth, cotton textiles, knitwear, daily cosmetics, handicrafts, shoes and hats, canned food, porcelain, bamboo and rattan ware, toys, stationery, leather goods, suitcases, etc., covering almost all domestic goods. The office is located in Hengyuanli, Tianjin Road. Yesterday, it notified all industries to participate as much as possible. Once the registration quota is full, a lottery will be held for store locations. The following is a list of registration instructions: (1) To facilitate manufacturers in distributing goods, jointly promoting sales, and facilitating retail, to expand business, this distribution center is established to meet the rental needs of Chinese manufacturers. (2) All goods produced by Chinese manufacturers can participate in this distribution center for retail needs. (3) Manufacturers who wish to rent space or rooms in this distribution center should first obtain two copies of the registration form, fill them out clearly, and then send both registration forms to the management office of the distribution center for registration. (4) The registration form must be filled out in detail and legibly, without cursive writing. It must be stamped with the official seal and signed and sealed by the general manager to be valid. Applications without a seal will not be accepted. (5) After registration, the management office of the distribution center will issue a registration certificate to the registered manufacturer for verification. This registration certificate is valid for ten days, after which it will expire. (6) After a manufacturer's registration is reviewed and approved by the management office of the distribution center, a letter will be sent to notify them to collect the rental rules and lease agreement. After the manufacturer completes the procedures, they can rent the space. (7) If a manufacturer's registration is deemed unqualified by the management office of the distribution center after review, the registration form will be returned, and the registration certificate will be collected to complete the process. (8) This distribution center mainly focuses on the common products of various industries.

Due to limited space, regardless of the order of registration, the management office of the distribution center will review and approve applications. If an application is deemed unqualified, or if only one business is selected from an industry, the remaining applications will be rejected without objection. This is to be clearly understood.

### Prostitute's Madam Forces a Good Woman into Prostitution

Qian Pusun, a Suzhou woman residing at Yongchangli, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou District, whose husband works as a sedan carrier and is addicted to opium, has a daughter named Qian Caixiu, fifteen years old this year. During the first month of this year, Qian Pusun, due to being pushed for financial reasons, sold Caixiu to the Tangji brothel at 8, Guidong Anli, Mintini Avenue, which was operated by Pan Axiu, a 49-year-old woman, for 140 yuan. Recently, the French Concession police suddenly received an anonymous letter from Suzhou, reporting that Qian's daughter had been sold and was being abused by the madam. The French police then ordered detectives to arrest Pan Axiu and Qian Caixiu at that address for investigation. Based on their confessions, Qian Pusun was also arrested and escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where they were charged in accordance with the law. Judge Jiang presided over the trial. The defendant, Pan Axiu, confessed that she bought Qian's daughter from a matchmaker this spring for 140 yuan, with a two-year contract. The defendant, Qian Pusun, confessed that because her husband was addicted to opium and they could not make a living, she sold her daughter to a brothel. The victim, Qian Caixiu, confessed that she was not a prostitute, but her parents had no food to eat and sold her to the brothel. The court, after examining the testimony, announced that the case's debate was closed and the judgment would be given on the 20th of this month. Pan Axiu was returned to custody, Qian Pusun was released on bail pending sentencing, and Qian Caixiu was taken back by Qian Pusun and was warned against selling her daughter again.

### Pu Hai Bank Debt Case; Creditor Group Files an Appeal

Li Jingyan and others, representatives of the Pu Hai Bank creditor group in Minhang, filed an appeal regarding their request for the bank to repay deposits. The Second Branch of the Higher Court held a hearing at 9 AM on the 15th of this month, presided over by Han Zuzhi, the Presiding Judge of the Civil Court. The appellants were represented by lawyers Song Mingxun and Shen Yushan, and the appellees were represented by lawyers Cai Rudong and Gao Junxiang. First, lawyers Song and Shen stated the reasons for the appeal, arguing that a bank should be a corporate organization, and a corporation must have a license to be established. This is made clear by the Supreme Court's precedent No. 2535 of the 22nd year of the Republic. The appellees only presented evidence of registration in the original trial but did not present evidence of having a license, so the company could not be deemed to be legally established. Therefore, the debts it incurred should be the responsibility of the appellees for joint repayment. As for the Nanhua branch office, it was not registered but was a partnership, as stipulated in Article 5 of the registration rules. The debts incurred by that branch should also be the responsibility of the appellees for joint repayment. In addition, the original trial did not consider the savings accounts of various customers, and the request was made to handle them in accordance with Article 15 of the Savings Bank Law. Lawyers Cai and Gao, representing the appellees, then rose to respond, mainly relying on the wording of the original judgment. They did not present conclusive evidence regarding the license. Finally, the Presiding Judge asked each of the appellants about the evidence they presented and then announced the debate concluded, setting the judgment for the morning of the 20th.

### A Mainland Gambling Den Opens on Weihaiwei Road

It was previously rumored that a club named "Mainland" would appear on Weihaiwei Road in the Public Concession, which was actually a gambling den. A person surnamed Ma initially came forward to raise funds, but internal disagreements and the problem of permits being difficult to resolve almost caused the project to be abandoned. Later, a powerful person joined, promoting someone surnamed Xiang as the host, and the project proceeded smoothly, so it officially opened a few days ago. However, the entrance is very strict, and one cannot enter without an introduction from someone they know.

### Man Seeking Treatment for Gunshot Wound

A man named Lü Ronglin, thirty years old, a native of Pudong, residing at No. 14, Rongxing Alley, Zhujia Ku, Haig Road, West Shanghai, hired a rickshaw yesterday morning around 2:00 AM to seek treatment at the nearby Red Cross Hospital for a gunshot wound to his leg. According to him, while he was sound asleep in bed, a stray bullet pierced through the wall and struck his right leg. The bullet went through, causing profuse bleeding. He was then taken to the hospital for treatment by rickshaw. However, as the location falls within the extraterritorial area, verification was not immediately possible.

### Leather Goods Store Burgled; Owner Extorted; Armed Robbery of 500 Yuan; Owner Injured Falling; Perpetrator Finally Arrested

Dahua Leather Goods Store on Yu Qiaqing Road was burglarized of a large quantity of leather goods on January 18th. The incident was reported to the police. After investigation, detectives suspected Wang Gentao from Shanghai and Sun Shisheng from Pudong, both former employees of the store, of being the main culprits. They were planning to arrest them, but to their surprise, at 9:50 PM on the 21st, Wang and Sun, accompanied by two others, went to Dahua with two handguns. They forced the store owner, Shen Maoguang, to hand over 500 yuan in legal tender, threatening to kill him if he refused. Shen, in a moment of desperation, jumped out of the window to escape, severely injuring his lower back. Seeing the situation turning unfavorable, Wang and his accomplices scattered and fled. Afterwards, Wang sent threatening letters to Shen, urging him to quickly hand over the 500 yuan, or the entire family would be in danger. However, Shen was severely injured and remains in the hospital to this day. On the day before yesterday, Detective Xue Youwen of the Old Zhabei Police Station learned that Wang Gentao was waiting for his accomplices at the Dashin Company department store, plotting something illegal. He led Detectives Ding Yizhong and Zhou Wenqing to the location at 6:00 PM and apprehended Wang. Subsequently, Sun Shisheng was arrested at No. 1280, Jing'an Temple Road. After interrogation, they also arrested Zhou Zhimao (also known as Little Jiangbei), a native of Jiangbei, at No. 9, Lane 232, Caishi Road. Yesterday, they were all taken to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police lawyer, Chen Ming, explained the case. Due to the need for further investigation, he requested permission to temporarily detain them pending further investigation. After questioning by Feng Shide, the judge ordered them to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.

### Young Woman Abducted into Prostitution; Unable to Endure Abuse, Reports to Police; Brothel Owner Charged with Two Crimes

Wang Lingmei (also known as Wang Anan), a local woman aged 19, lived alone in the Nanshi district. After the Shanghai war, she sought refuge in the concession but became separated from her family. In May of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), she was abducted and sold to Ge Arong and Ge Bai (i.e., Ge Pu), a couple from Suzhou who ran a brothel at No. 9, Lane 65, Shantou Road. From then on, the woman fell into the pit of fire and was forced into an inhuman existence.

Her suffering was indescribable. Over the past two years, Wang has given birth to a son named Genlin, who is now only one year and five months old. Despite having a son, she was still forced to continue her life of prostitution. On the 13th of this month, because Genlin wet the bed, the Ge couple severely beat and injured her. Unable to bear the suffering, she secretly reported to the Old Zhabei Police Station. Western Police Chief Fang Teerhua arrested the Ge couple at No. 101, Santao. It was also discovered that the Ge couple had been sentenced to six months in prison with a three-year suspended sentence by the Hankou District Court for a similar incident in Hankou. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the case, charging them with violating public morals under Article 231 of the Criminal Law and with assault under Article 277 of the same law. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, the case was adjourned for further review.

The French Concession Police dispatched a large number of detectives at approximately 7:00 AM on the 15th to raid a large-scale international morphine trafficking operation at a certain address in Dongqianjia Tang. Because the police are still investigating the case, the details have not yet been released. However, it is reported that four Chinese nationals, as well as a total of fifteen Russians, Koreans, and others, were arrested inside the operation at the time. Dozens of pounds of morphine, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, were seized on the spot.

### Elderly Woman Injured in Fall

### Sand and Gravel Industry Association Mediates Dispute Among Members

It is reported that Lu Xiaozuo, chairman of the Sand and Gravel Industry Association, who was arrested at a tea party of the Sand and Gravel Industry Association on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, was released on the same day. According to reports, the police took this action to ask him about the recent disputes among members of the sand and gravel industry. Since the Shanghai sand and gravel industry was controlled by the "Jiangnan Industrial Company" organized by the Japanese puppet regime, only one-third was allowed to be operated by various merchants. The members of the association had been in dispute over this one-third of the sand and gravel, and the association has now decided to start mediation at 4:00 PM today to avoid internal strife.

### Suicide Cases Recorded

Liu Genfa: Liu Genfa, a 19-year-old local man, a resident of No. 1, Yuanyuan Hotel, next to the Grand Theater on Jiangxi Road, committed suicide by swallowing morphine poison in his room around 12:15 PM yesterday due to economic hardship. The incident was reported to the Old Zhabei Police Station, who dispatched Detective Bao No. 224 to the scene. An ambulance was summoned and he was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment.

Wang Suzhen: Wang Suzhen, a 24-year-old local woman, residing at No. 1, Xicheng Alley, Avenue Moller, French Concession, had a quarrel with her mother over a minor family matter around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. Shortly after, taking advantage of the others' inattention, she secretly swallowed opium paste and committed suicide. She soon showed symptoms of poisoning and was discovered and taken to the hospital for treatment.

### Information on the Empress of Asia Liner: Arriving and Departing Today

The Changxing Company's Empress of Asia liner, which departed from Vancouver on the 4th of this month for Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Luzon, was forced to stop sailing due to the outbreak of the Second European War. It was delayed in Shanghai for one day. The next day, it was ordered to proceed as usual. Therefore, it raised anchor on the evening of the 6th and sailed to Hong Kong and Luzon, delaying the sailing schedule by one day. The speed was increased en route, so the return trip from Luzon to Shanghai was still according to the original schedule, arriving at the port at 9:00 AM today, docking at the Hongkou Gonghexing Wharf. The passenger tender will depart from the Customs Wharf at 8:00 AM today. Passengers will be disembarked at the Customs Wharf between 9:15 and 10:15 AM. The liner was originally scheduled to return to Vancouver tomorrow, but it is now reported that it will depart for export at 5:00 PM today. The passenger tender will depart from the Customs Wharf at 3:30 PM.

### It's a Good Autumn Because the Weather is Cool

Due to the southward advance of the northern cold air mass, the weather in this city is becoming autumnal. There was a light drizzle yesterday morning, which lasted for a long time before it stopped. However, the sky remained very gloomy. The Pacific hurricane continues to move northwest, but it is far from Shanghai, so the wind force is unknown. The high tide that started on the 14th of this month in the Huangpu River is still continuing. The tide will be particularly high around 2:00 PM today, and it will not subside until after the 19th.

### Lost Girl Waiting to be Claimed

Wu Xianju, a lost girl, is 6 years old and from Ganpu, Zhejiang. She was lost in the jurisdiction of the Putuo Road Police Station in the Shanghai Public Concession on May 13th of this year. She was sent to the Jiliang Institute by the police and then sent to the Children's Shelter of the Bureau of Public Works' Children's Welfare Department. According to the Children's Shelter, there has been no sign of anyone looking for the girl since she was lost. There are now reputable, upper-class families, who adhere to Christianity, planning to adopt the girl as an adopted daughter. In addition to promising to be responsible for her education, they will also take care of her marriage and provide her with inheritance rights. However, the Children's Shelter still hopes that the girl's parents will come to claim her within one month. Otherwise, it will be regarded as intentional abandonment, and the child will be fully placed. Her parents should not delay.

### Police Seeking Identification of Murdered Man

On the 7th of this month, an unidentified Chinese man (see photo) was found lying on the side of the road across from No. 50 on Medhurst Road (50 yards from Dahua Road) with axe wounds. He was immediately taken to Baolong Hospital by the fire department's ambulance, but he had already died. Anyone who can identify the photo is requested to report to the Jing'an Temple Police Station.

### Letters to the Editor

To the Editor:

Having read the news report in your newspaper yesterday about the arrest of Lu Xiaozuo, chairman of the Sand and Gravel Association, the statements made therein are inconsistent with the facts. I have never participated in the "Jiangnan Company" and have never entered into a contract with the Maibian Foreign Company to supply yellow sand. How could there be a situation of violation of the arrest? It is obviously someone who is slandering and framing me out of spite. In addition to secretly investigating and handling the matter, I hereby make a statement, and I hope you will correct it.

Sincerely,

Lu Xiaozuo, September 16th

To the Editor of the Shen Bao:

Having read the news report in your newspaper on the 10th of this month, "The Price of Pigments is Rising Sharply, and Various Dye Factories Refuse to Dye Materials", it is completely inconsistent with the facts. Leaving aside the situation of the entire industry, as far as our factory is concerned, although the price of pigments has risen sharply, it is not due to a shortage of goods. Our factory can purchase at high prices and can dye as much as needed. Therefore, business is as usual, and there is no refusal to dye. Your newspaper's report is likely based on inaccurate rumors. I am sending this letter to inform you and hope that you will correct it.

Sincerely,

Lao Zhenghe Maoji Dye Factory, September 16th

### Conduct

— Lu Lishi

In class, the teacher sometimes says to the students: "Recently, the conduct of many students has been too bad..." When the students hear this, they immediately straighten their backs, close their mouths tightly, look at their noses, and sit respectfully and silently.

Most children think that to have good conduct, they just need to not speak, not move, and the more like an old person they are, the more qualified they are. This concept is completely wrong and must be corrected.

Dear children, we should know that good or bad conduct is not in these trivial matters, and that being lively and expressing oneself are fundamentally good behaviors.

I believe that good or bad conduct depends on our attitude towards others. If a child is willing to work hard, is responsible, hardworking, and can take care of public property and help others, then that is a child with good conduct. If they are jealous of others and only do things for their own benefit, then even if that child sits still all day, their conduct cannot be considered good. If they do bad things but pretend to be well-behaved, then the badness of their conduct goes without saying.

Many children like or hope to receive rewards and compliments from others, which is also a loss in terms of conduct. Why? Because we should strive for good conduct, but not to seek rewards or compliments. Because when this kind of mentality is formed, it is easy to be fake in doing things, and very prone to pride and arrogance.

Perhaps some children will ask me, "How can I be an excellent student with good conduct?" To answer this question cannot be done in a few words. To put it succinctly: first, do more things that benefit others and the public; second, be able to reflect on yourself at all times; third, read more books that are beneficial to your body and mind; and fourth, participate in social activities in many ways.

### The Huitong Bridge Filled with Flesh and Blood

— Yin

Nine hundred and seventy-two kilometers of highway, three hundred and seventy highway bridges, one million four hundred thousand cubic feet of stone masonry, nearly ten million cubic feet of earthwork, but without a single machine, without using a huge amount of the national treasury, relying only on the rush construction of twenty-five million migrant workers, this Yunnan-Burma Road has been fully opened to traffic in just five months. When you read the history and geography lesson about Yunnan, have you ever thought of this highway filled with flesh and blood?

During the construction of this highway, there are many moving and remarkable historical materials worth remembering. Now I will only introduce to the children one of the three hundred and seventy bridges, the Huitong Bridge. Huitong Bridge is a large bridge over the Nu River. Children have already read about the Nu River in textbooks. Its water is turbulent and its temperament is violent. I don't need to describe it much. One sentence can include its nature, that is, it is like a giant python.

When this bridge was being built, three kinds of workers were requisitioned: Indian ironworkers, Guangdong carpenters from the source of the revolution, and Yunnan stonemasons with experience in building the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. In order to make the bridge body strong enough to carry thousands of tons of steel, chestnut wood must be used as the material, but this chestnut wood is not a wood that can be found everywhere. They are all hidden deep in the primeval forests of the mountains. It takes seven or eight days to travel, touching cliffs and in and out of thorny forests, to cut down the wood from there and supply it to this modern construction project. Hundreds of workers have to constantly search in the dark ancient forests, waving their hands non-stop.

Fortunately, the construction of the Huitong Bridge only utilized the existing piers and strengthened the original load-bearing capacity. If it were to be like the other bridges, starting the foundation work first, I don't know how much more flesh and blood would be filled under the bridge. Speaking of this, we cannot but thank Mr. Liang Jinshan, a compatriot from Burma, who, in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), donated a huge sum of money to build an iron cable bridge to facilitate travelers, because he saw how many compatriots died on bamboo rafts crossing the river every year. Now, it has similarly saved a lot of sweat and blood for this project.

In this project, at least one-eighth of the number sacrificed for the sake of the country's future, most of which were due to a kind of miasma and other engineering dangers. But are we really going to let this group of nameless heroes sleep silently underground without a sound?

### The Third Home

— Bai Zheng

—Ming'er's Refuge Record Thirty-four—

Ming'er's family drifted around and traveled all over the mountains and rivers. It was really unexpected that they would build a third home in a foreign land thousands of miles away from their hometown. However, the construction costs - a lot of money, long treks, and endless energy - were also considerable.

After arriving at their destination, they were fortunate to have Mr. Zhang to take care of them, and everything was taken care of. Otherwise, I don't know how chaotic it would have been. The local residents also expressed sympathy for them with a pitying attitude, and seemed very willing to help. Mr. Zhang even found a flat house in a corner of the village to serve as Ming'er's third home. Ming'er's father was of course very grateful for his enthusiasm, and the rent was surprisingly cheap. It turned out that the house belonged to Mr. Zhang's relatives. They originally said they didn't want rent, but Ming'er's father always felt it was inappropriate, so in the end he paid one yuan a month as rent. Ming'er's father thanked him again and again. The people in that village were really treating them to the extreme.

The environment of Ming'er's third home is very good - distant mountains surround all sides, serving as their barrier. There is a mountain stream on the west side, flowing gurgling all day long. To the south are criss-crossing fields. To the northeast are neighbors. Behind the house is a patch of grassland, which is a paradise for pigs, cows, and sheep. The structure of this house is very different from Ming'er's hometown: in the center of the house is a living room without windows, which cannot block the cold wind in winter. In front of the hall is a narrow patio, with a tank in the middle facing the living room (it is said that the houses in that village are all the same due to feng shui). Therefore, the doors all open on the side. On both sides of the living room are two small bedrooms, with only one small window hole. The inside is terribly dark, and the air has a turbid smell. Even Ming'er's younger siblings dare not step into it during the day.

This is completely unlike the brightness of the houses in my hometown. It is simply impossible to find a large and bright bedroom in that village. This is a very deep impression for Ming'er.

The house is there, but what about the utensils in the house? Ming'er's family didn't even have a long bench, and the family's necessities - bed, table, chairs, stove, firewood... were extremely complicated. Buy them one by one? It's too expensive, and this home is temporary. Fortunately, the landlady is very polite, but because the two sides don't speak the same language, Mr. Zhang explained to Ming'er's mother: the landlady has everything at home, so there's no need to buy anything. Just write a note and they can move it in. That made Ming'er's whole family extremely grateful. The landlady also personally brought the things Ming'er's family needed from her home outside the alley. Her feet were small and not agile, and she was already over fifty years old, which made Ming'er's mother very uneasy, so she asked Ming'er and others to help. Such a landlady is rare. It took about two days of busy work to get everything in order, and this third home was somewhat presentable. During these busy two days, Ming'er's family temporarily did not cook, because what pots, what firewood, etc. had to be prepared by themselves and had not been bought yet, so they had to eat at Mr. Zhang's house. After two days, everything was finally ready, but where to buy vegetables? In that village, except for meat, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, everything else was not sold, because the families in this village always had some open space to grow some vegetables, which was enough for the needs of a family, but what should Ming'er's family do? The landlady was so good that she picked some vegetable skins (the villagers all eat vegetable skins and let the vegetable hearts grow) from the vegetables grown in her own field and gave them to them. Ming'er's mother was very grateful. If a hawker came to the alley with some vegetables or the like, she would always help him return the good and cheap price and personally take the scales to Ming'er's house to make gestures (because they didn't speak the same language) to inform him. When Ming'er's mother saw her scales, she understood her meaning.

"The third home was built entirely with the help of the landlady. We are very lucky that people are taking care of us everywhere." One night, Ming'er's mother muttered.

### Scientific Common Sense

— Moyan

Why can water extinguish fire?

Children! If you dip a burning candle into water, the candle will quickly go out. What is the reason for this?

The original burning of a candle only requires air, (especially the oxygen in the air), and does not require water. Now, when the candle is immersed in water, the water prevents the air from coming into contact with the fire. Without air, the fire will naturally be extinguished.

We can also use other methods to put out the fire, such as throwing a quilt or blanket over it, or sprinkling yellow sand on the fire. Because quilts, blankets, and yellow sand can prevent air from coming into contact with fire, the fire will be extinguished as a result.

Why does blowing out a candle make it go out?

When we want to extinguish a burning match or a candle, we never splash water on them, we only need to blow a breath at them to quickly extinguish the fire. What is the reason for this?

If we want to strike a match, we must first heat it up, rub it on the side of the matchbox, or touch it to something hot, and then it will catch fire. So, how do we extinguish it? Just make it cold again, how do we make it cold again? Just blow on it. So we blow on a match to cool it down and extinguish it.

### Reasons for the Price Increase of Towels

— (Moxi)

Towels are completely domestic products and do not seem to have much to do with foreign exchange, but recently the prices have also soared. According to people in the industry, the pigments for printing must be imported. Now that the price of pigments has risen, printed towels cost six or seven cents more per dozen than plain white towels. If the price of pigments rises again, the price of towels will inevitably rise to an alarming extent.

I think, wiping your face requires cleanliness, so you can use plain white towels. Why must you have colored ones? We are now vigorously practicing thrift, and we should pay special attention to daily necessities. Plain white towels are clean and hygienic, elegant and economical, and it is very easy to implement the change. It is even more convenient than not smoking paper cigarettes and changing to dry tobacco. I hope that friends with ideals and節exercise will all come to promote and implement it.

It is not difficult for cotton mills to stop making colored毛, but if the general users who love colored products do not change their mentality, then they will instead promote business for imported products. Therefore, this small movement should be promoted to the public. (Unpaid)

### The Animal Realm (18)

— Xin Qing

After Peng Qi recovered from his illness, the first thing he insisted on when going downstairs was to see Lufu. He had it brought to the guest room. It turned out that he had gone through hardships with this curly-haired dog, and his feelings for it were particularly good. The servant went to open the dog house and released Lufu. Lufu had been missing Peng Qi very much, and immediately rushed into the room. As soon as it reached the front hall, it smelled Peng Qi's scent and rushed to the guest room without the servant's guidance. Peng Qi heard the tinkling of the bell and knew that Lufu had arrived, so he quickly stood up and opened his arms to greet it. Lufu barked as if it wasn't barking, then pounced into Peng Qi's arms, then collapsed and fell to the ground. Was it dead? Yes, Lufu was dead. That bark was an expression of indescribable joy. Its body was already extremely weak. Seeing its little master and receiving an unexpected stimulus, it died of happiness due to over-stimulation.

Peng Qi lost a loyal friend and was very sad. Tears of sorrow dripped onto his scarred little face, completely dispelling his cruel nature. Although he had committed many sins before, he now only wanted to repent. From then on, he became particularly kind to animals and became a good friend to them. Eventually, he became a first-rate expert in animal studies. From ancient times to the present, many naughty children, as long as they reform and strive for improvement, can later become extraordinary people. Peng Qi was just one example.

After Peng Qi fully recovered his health, he and his two younger sisters jointly cared for animals and opened a small animal yard at home, as their animal realm. Peng Qi wanted to find another shaggy dog like Lufu, but he couldn't find one, so he made Nuokesi his only friend. He said, "I want to make a dog that knows Lufu my friend, to keep a permanent memory. If Nuokesi doesn't hold my past misdeeds against me, I believe I am now worthy of being its friend." How could Nuokesi hold his past misdeeds against him? They had saved its life. Now seeing him treat it well, it would naturally be loyal to him, just like Lufu was in life.

Peng Qi slowly saved his pocket money, and when he had accumulated a substantial sum, he erected a monument on Lufu's grave. The monument was engraved with these words: "In memory of a loyal friend, who was rough in appearance but gentle in heart. Died of happiness in a certain year and month upon seeing his master recover from illness." (The End)

### Random Recollections of Chrysanthemum Matters (Part 1)

— Xiao Cang

During the Xuantong reign of the late Qing Dynasty, there were four outstanding young actors in Peking Opera specializing in the "xusheng" (bearded male) roles: Guan Dayuan, Xiao Xiangyuan, Jin Si Hong, and Xiao Chang Geng. All four excelled in portraying calm expressions and clear articulation. However, they failed to maintain lasting fame. The whereabouts of Xiao Xiangyuan and Xiao Chang Geng are unknown. Jin Si Hong retired to teach at the Fu Lian Cheng opera school. Guan Dayuan, despite having collaborated with Shang Xiaoyun, Cheng Yanqiu, and Xu Biyun, ultimately remained undeveloped. Such was the fate of the four outstanding young "xusheng" actors of the late Qing Dynasty! Among young actors in southern China specializing in "xusheng" roles, such as Xiao Gui Fen (i.e., Zhang Gui Fen) in his early years and Xiao Yang Yuelou in the early Republic, both displayed remarkable talent. Additionally, Yu Shuyan and Yang Baozhong in northern China were renowned in Tianjin during their childhoods. However, few who displayed early talent ultimately achieved great success. The vicissitudes of Peking Opera often result in fleeting brilliance, like the ephemerality of the Dutchman's pipe. It is unknown how many others have experienced this. Xiao Xiangyuan was also able to comb his hair into three strands and dress as a "qingyi" (female) role, but this was only occasional amusement and should not be delved into by those discussing opera.

Moreover, old Peking had its "Four Flowers": Lan Weipei Yu (Orchid), Shui Xian Xiaoxia (Daffodil), Shao Yao Wanhua (Peony), and Tu Mi Yufu (Rose). Yao Yuanchu had a poem on the "Four Flowers and Seven Memories," each poem alluding to a specific event. Today, only Wanhua remains prominent in the Peking Opera scene. Yufu has retired to assist the Mei Lanfang troupe, not using her stage name but becoming wealthy, demonstrating her skill. As for Peiyu and Xiaoxia, people today do not even know their names, let alone that they were once among the "Four Flowers." Recording this article, I cannot help but feel the vicissitudes of life.

Around 1913-1914, female Peking Opera performers rose to prominence in the old capital, causing a sensation. There were Dan actors such as Liu Xikui, Jin Yulan, Xiao Xiangshui, Jin Gangzuan, Xiao Jufen, and Du Yunhong; Qingyi actors such as Bai Suchen and Jin Yuelan; Wusheng actors such as Zhao Ziyun and Gui Yunfeng; Laodan actors such as Shang Junqing; and Jing actors such as Jin Fengkui, all of whom were renowned. At that time, performers like Zhang Xiaoxian and Li Guifen were not yet famous. Among them, Shang Junqing, although playing Laodan roles, was refined and elegant, standing out from the crowd. Furthermore, Bai Suchen's Qingyi performance adhered to the norms, not inferior to male performers. The owner of Lingxiao Hange wanted to keep her as a mistress, but she was ultimately obtained by my teacher, Mr. Chen Aosheng of Yinxian. After leaving the stage in 1919, she returned to the stage, but she was no longer the same as before. It is true that for people in this profession, five years can seem like a lifetime.

### Ren Guang and An E

— An Lan

Ren Guang and An E, the authors of popular film songs such as "Fisherman's Song" and "Wolf Fighting Song," were originally a passionate couple who had lived together for a long time but had never held a wedding ceremony.

Before the August 13th Incident, Ren Guang went to Paris to study music. Now he has returned to China and transferred to Chongqing, the new capital, to teach at the Art Institute founded by Mr. Tao Xingzhi. At the same time, he is also leading Chongqing's famous singing group. It is said that he is also preparing to go abroad again in the near future.

An E is not only active in Chongqing's music groups, but she has also joined the New Life Women's Work Corps led by Madam Chiang. In addition, whenever she has free time, she desperately writes patriotic lyrics for various music groups and singing groups to perform together.

Now, this pair of famous Chinese songwriters, a couple who had gone through hard times together, have met again in Chongqing. It is inevitable that their old love will rekindle. However, according to their close friends, they value their sacred work more than their personal feelings. This is worth emulating by those who only talk about "saving the country through love."

(Editor's note) It is rumored that An E is cohabitating with a certain military officer in Chongqing, while this article says that she and Ren Guang are still in love as before. What is the actual situation of An E? We hope that friends in the new capital will provide confirmation.

### Talking About Wang Chuansong

— Dong Cun Jushi

In Kun Opera troupes, the "Jing" role is called "Dahua Mian" (big painted face), the "Fu" role is called "Erhua Mian" (second painted face), and the "Chou" role is called "Xiaohua Mian" (small painted face). The terms for "Chou" and "Jing" are the same in Peking Opera troupes. The "Fu" role is particularly important in Kun Opera troupes, because loyalty, righteousness, and filial piety must be contrasted with treachery and deceit. Tang Biaobei in "A Handful of Snow," and Cao Cao in "Discussing the Sword" and "Offering the Sword" are all treacherous "Fu" roles. Zhang Sanlang in "Water Margin" and Ximen Qing in "Righteous Heroes" both contain elements of eroticism. Recently, Wang Chuansong's masterpieces "Borrowing Boots," "Dog Hole," and "Inviting a Doctor" have been popular. Chuansong began learning his art later than Chuanming and Chuanjian, but his dialogue, facial expressions, and demeanor are all excellent. Shanghai people who enjoy listening to storytelling must come to listen to the music every other day, paying attention to Chuansong's dialogue, because it is humorous and lively, with winking eyes and shrugged shoulders, washing away the depression in our hearts.

In "Nai He Tian," Chuansong plays Que Buquan, who is one-eyed, lame, and hunchbacked. His movements and actions are just like a rich young master who is illiterate, truly a masterpiece of nature, reaching perfection. The scenes "Misunderstanding" and "Drunken Fragrance" are hilarious, with an ugly man getting a beautiful wife, his foolish state making people laugh. Combined with Zhu Chuanming's Zou Shi and Zhang Chuanfang's Wu Shi, they complement each other, and viewers still praise them to this day. The melody and pronunciation, with the yin and yang of the words, the length of the tunes, the high and low pitches, and the fast and slow tempos, cannot deviate from the flute score by even a fraction. Chuansong performs with stage steps and gestures that follow the rules, and his singing is natural. My friend, Layman Suxiang, is deeply knowledgeable in this art, saying that listening to Chuansong's play is like climbing a high mountain to watch the idle clouds and wild birds, changing in an instant, truly knowing that a clever person has his own talent. Now he is performing in "Fairy Rainbow," and his future is limitless. If you don't believe me, why not go and see it.

Charlie Chaplin's new film "The Great Dictator" (The Great Dictator) is in full swing. The picture above is Chaplin and his lover Pauline Goddard. Their smiles are captivating, and their attitudes are very relaxed.

New Movie Intro

### Coffee Waitress

— Qi Hua

"Good Girls Go To Paris"

Comedy, comedy, another humorous comedy.

The story of "Coffee Waitress" is pieced together from beginning to end by "coincidence." From Jenny, a girl who works as a waitress in a university tea room, to New York, a complex erotic entanglement unfolds, and she finally marries Professor Ronnie. The Olaf family, deliberately depicted by the playwright, is exactly what we are used to seeing in big cities. Every character is willful and deceitful, pursuing their own selfish desires and wasting their lives at the same time. Let's take a look at the Olaf family:

Grandfather Olaf is stubborn and confused, almost neurotic; Mother Caroline has a young boyfriend; son Tom is a wanderer by nature; daughter Shirley is in love with the old servant's son, Dennis.

Alexander Hall's directorial skills are very strong. He dissects each character in this family very clearly, and his delicate and exquisite carving is seen in the following two examples.

(1) Jenny arrived at the Olaf home, and Mother Caroline falsely claimed that she was a classmate of her daughter Shirley, who came to attend the wedding, winning the heart of grandfather Olaf. At breakfast the next day, the astonishment of son Tom, the feigned kindness of the daughter and Jenny were all handled very vividly. After University Professor Ronnie (Shirley's fiancé) arrived, an even more lively scene unfolded.

(2) On the evening of Shirley and Ronnie's wedding, the director had to unravel such a complex love entanglement at the same time, and his calm and unhurried technique was rare. For example, Caroline was tempted by her boyfriend Paul and was about to elope with him. Jenny deliberately tempted Paul to dissuade Caroline. But grandfather Olaf announced the news of his grandson Tom and Jenny's engagement, which shocked Paul and Ronnie. Suddenly, a lawyer came to see Olaf, saying that Jenny and Dennis were out on the town at night, and their car hit a passerby, who was now disabled, requesting compensation. In fact, it was Shirley who was out on the town with Dennis, and she lied and said it was Jenny. And Jenny, because Tom owed a gambler five thousand dollars and couldn't repay it, Jenny admitted to Shirley's impersonation, using the five thousand dollars as a condition to repay Tom's gambling debt. But Ronnie knew that Jenny had not been out on the town that night, and forced her to question, only then did she reveal everyone's secrets.

Melvyn Douglas's University Professor Ronnie is very steady. Joan Blondell's Jenny played the frivolous and dissolute part in the first half very well, but the self-sacrifice and psychological conflicts in the second half were not prominent enough. Walter Connolly is the most successful actor in this film, because his actions and words can grasp the character of Olaf.

The Nanfeng Drama Society is scheduled to hold its first experimental public performance at the Xiqiao Lane Xianle Grand Theater at 9:30 am on Sunday, the 17th. The repertoire includes three one-act plays: "The Fool," "Two Difficult Friends," and "Setting Free." Ticket prices are one yuan, six cents, and four cents.

The Shanghai Dramatic Arts Society will suspend performances for two days on the 17th and 18th due to martial law, and will stage "The Beginning of Man" from the 19th, which is worth seeing.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Story of Wang Keqin's Union and Separation with Zhang Xun

Keqin was also an unforgiving shrew. Anyone who had seen her perform in "Killing the Son for Revenge" would be terrified of her. When quarreling, she would shout, "I was forced by you men to be your concubine, who cares about being the wife of a pigtail general!" She was originally justified, and even Zhang Xun would sometimes feel guilty when he heard it, but he couldn't help her. Coincidentally, Keqin gave birth to a son, named Mengfan, and therefore became even more arrogant. Speaking of this son, there was also a strange story. Outside the South Gate of Xuzhou City, there was a tomb of Fan Zeng, which the people of Xuzhou called Tushan. According to legend, King Xiang of Chu fell for the counter-espionage plot of the Han Dynasty, and therefore suspected Zeng, so Zeng abandoned Yu and left. Later, a carbuncle erupted on his back and he died. Yu's soldiers dug up soil to bury him, which was more than ten feet high. Next to it was a river called Shajia Wang, which was said to be the place where the soil was dug up that year. On the day Wang gave birth to her son, she suddenly dreamed that Fan Zeng entered her womb, so she named him Mengfan. Whether this was actually the case, or whether she was using this to ingratiate herself and deliberately deceive Zhang Xun, is something that outsiders could not know. However, since giving birth to her son, Keqin was even more favored by Zhang Xun, and the young concubine gradually fell out of favor. She eventually became blind due to jealousy and depression, and her temper became irritable. Not long after, Zhang Xun took another concubine named Xiaocui. In order to retaliate against Keqin, Xiaocui tried her best to win her over, slandering Keqin in front of Zhang. Later, when Zhang took refuge in the Dutch embassy, he ordered each concubine to take turns sleeping with him. Keqin was ashamed and unwilling to go, and was therefore hated by Zhang Xun. Cui and others, knowing that Zhang deeply hated opium, induced Keqin to smoke it. When Zhang came out, the two angers merged into one, and he threatened to kill Keqin, but in reality, it was just intimidation. Keqin was greatly afraid, so she ran away from Zhang and resumed performing on the old Gong Stage in Shanghai. However, at that time, her beauty had faded and her addiction was deep, so her appeal was naturally much weaker. (103)

### Germany's Policies and Strategies

— Cheng

Harvesting from the Soviet Union, Miscalculation with Britain

Unwilling to Expand the War

If we do not understand the actual truth and only look at the surface, we will often feel as if we have fallen into a maze and cannot get a correct judgment. For example, after Germany attacked Poland, Britain and France had already mobilized and attacked Germany's western border, and Germany was also sharpening its swords and preparing to fight to the death. However, German officials still propagandized that Germany was willing to eliminate centuries-old feuds with France, resolve suspicions, and reconcile. Germany had no territorial demands on France. Even if France attacked Germany, Germany would only limit itself to retaliation. It also said that France's involvement in the war was entirely directed by Britain. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's statement on the Anglo-German negotiations in Danzig also severely criticized Britain, saying that any responsibility for causing the war should be borne by Britain.

What Is Feared Is Britain

From the above remarks, we can see two intentions of the German side. First, Germany is unwilling to expand the war. Second, Germany did not expect Britain's attitude to be so firm, so it is very afraid and hates Britain's standing on the French side to help Poland and fight against Germany. We know that Germany's war against Poland initially followed the old trick of fascism, trying to use the Nazi Party in Danzig, such as Forster and others, to organize secret armies and implement the so-called Critical War, overthrowing the original government of Danzig in one fell swoop, and carrying out Germany's conspiracy to occupy Danzig. However, this year's Polish government was not as easy to subdue as last year's Czech government. And Britain and France, wary of the viciousness of Germany's means of destroying Czechoslovakia in March of this year, did not allow Germany to put Czechoslovakia into Nazi hands as last year, after the mediation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, by holding a four-power conference. Under these circumstances, Germany took the risk and resorted to military force against Poland. It is impossible to say that Germany's aggression against Poland did not take into account France's assistance. But with only France, Germany can still cope easily. If Britain is added to France, that is what Germany fears most.

Eliminate Worries in the East

In Hitler's "Mein Kampf," which is regarded as the bible by the Nazis, Hitler severely criticized Wilhelm II's diplomatic policy during the last World War, which alienated both Britain and Russia, thus later making Germany have to fight on both the eastern and western battlefields militarily. Therefore, he strongly opposed naval competition with Britain, arousing Britain's resentment. At the same time, he also advocated avoiding competition with Britain for colonies and overseas trade, so that Britain would not interfere with Germany's actions on the European continent, and Germany would have the spare capacity to implement its territorial policy (BodenPolitik), which is the policy of developing towards Eastern Europe. The conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact relieved Hitler of his worries in the east, which can be said to be a partial success of his diplomatic policy. He also knew that Britain and France did not have geographical connections with Poland. If Poland fought against Germany, Britain and France would not be able to send troops to Poland to jointly fight and resist Germany. Therefore, as soon as the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact was established, Hitler launched a war against Poland with lightning speed, and that was the reason.

Temporarily Take a Defensive Posture in the West

Hitler's current strategy is of course to take a defensive posture in the West and use all his strength to attack Poland. After defeating Poland, he will return to the West and deal with Britain and France. The question is, can Germany, which lacks raw materials, wage a protracted war under the naval blockade of Britain and France? After the British and French navies blockaded Germany, all German shipping was cut off. All supplies, although dependent on neighboring neutral countries, but Britain and France will inevitably actively exercise diplomatic means against neutral countries in the future, so that they do not assist the belligerent countries, there is no doubt. This is the point that Germany fears and hates most about Britain's superior naval power.

Hope That Italy Can Mediate

In addition, Germany's current isolation is another reason for its anxiety. When the Danzig issue was most tense, Mussolini, another giant of the Axis powers, advised Hitler to be cautious. After the war broke out, Mussolini cited Germany's use of force to resolve the Danzig issue, which he was trying to resolve peacefully, believing that Germany's action undermined Italy's guarantee. Therefore, he decided to temporarily maintain neutrality. Although the German side unilaterally explained Italy's neutrality, saying that Italy's action made Britain and France's attitude towards Italy uncertain, which was more beneficial to Germany, it was actually just an excuse. In fact, who guarantees that Italy will not repeat the old trick of temporarily dismantling the stage in the last World War? Therefore, Germany has almost become a lonely figure on the international political stage, and its depression is conceivable. Now Germany is releasing the argument that it does not want to expand the war and does not want to attack France, as well as recently expressing that the two countries, Germany and Italy, still maintain the axis policy. Its intention is of course still to have Italy come out to mediate. After winning the victory in the attack on Poland, it can still obtain considerable rewards and stop, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes of the last World War. But I don't know whether Britain, which wants to "destroy Nazism before it stops," is only making empty threats against Germany with such a claim, or whether it will be thorough.

### The National Defense New Army on the Northern Battlefield - The 10th Army Corps

Commanded by General Shi Yousan, Engaged in Battles Across Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi Provinces

Perhaps the name of the 10th Army Corps may feel a bit unfamiliar to the people in the rear? But on the northern battlefield, the mention of the 10th Army Corps is known by everyone. It is a powerful elite force, a strong and massive power. It is a group of North China's sons and daughters closely united under the banner of national revolution, under the leadership of the brave General Shi Yousan.

For the past two years, pursuing the fleeing enemy without stopping, the brothers of the 10th Army Corps have worked hard, truly hard. They have galloped across the vast plains of Hebei, climbed the towering Wangwu Mountains, Zhongtiao Mountains, and the intricate mountainous areas of southern Shandong. They cherish their hometown so much that they have never left North China for two years. North China is the hometown where they grew up, and they are unwilling to leave it until death.

General Shi Yousan is the sole leader of the 10th Army Corps. It is truly fortunate that tens of thousands of strong men in North China can have such a wise and decisive leader. Mr. Shi is very strict in managing the army. In the Northwest Army, the mention of "King Yama" Shi brings chills to everyone's spines. Therefore, in every decisive battle, unless there is an order to retreat, the soldiers would rather die than leave the front lines.

The Growth of the 10th Army Corps

Like other troops, the 10th Army Corps has grown and strengthened day by day. Its origin was the North Hebei Security Command before the July 7th Incident. The troop had a total of more than 8,000 people.

The flames of the Lugou Bridge Incident ignited, and the great wave of Chinese national liberation was stirred up. A part of the security team once guarded the Lugou Bridge and made extremely glorious sacrifices. Subsequently, the security team transferred to Machang and Cangzhou, and was officially reorganized into the 181st Division. From then on, the North Hebei Security Team transformed into a formal national army.

In Cangzhou, the 181st Division was replaced by Liu Duoquan's army, and then fought with the Japanese in the Qingfeng-Daming area. In late January of last year, it was replaced by the 32nd Army, guarding the Tangyin front line of the Pinghan Railway. In early February, the Japanese surged south from Anyang like a tide. In order to avoid significant sacrifices, the Chinese army lured the Japanese deep into the area and then retreated along the Daoqing Railway into the mountainous areas of southern Shanxi, where they fought countless bloody battles and won numerous glorious victories, large and small. It was in the Zhongcun of Qinshui that Division Commander Shi was officially promoted to Commander of the 69th Army by the central government. In addition to the original 181st Division, the New 6th Division of the 29th Army (Commander was Gao Shuxun) was also assigned to the command of the 69th Army. Commander Shi smiled, and the brothers of the 181st Division also smiled. A glorious future filled everyone's hearts. That day, everyone celebrated all night, and the valleys of the Zhongtiao Mountains were filled with the joyful songs of the soldiers.

When the Battle of Taierzhuang became critical, the brave men of the 69th Army became eager and their blood boiled. They wanted to rush to Taierzhuang. Coincidentally, at this time, they received an order from the central government to reinforce Taierzhuang. The soldiers smiled because the opportunity to serve the country had come.

Growing Up in Battle

Arriving in Taierzhuang in early May, they were assigned to guard the right wing of Taierzhuang. They were then ordered to advance towards Tai'an, but on the way, Xuzhou fell, and the troops stayed in southern Shandong. In southern Shandong, the 69th Army harassed the Japanese on the one hand and worked on building fortifications on the other. After three months of hard work, the cultural level of the soldiers improved, the vacancies in each regiment and battalion were filled, and more than one division of new recruits were formed into a temporary division. At the same time, guerrilla teams from all over southern Shandong came to join them. For a time, the troops bearing the designation of the 69th Army numbered nearly 100,000 men, and the 69th Army had grown stronger.

In mid-August, Army Commander Shi was promoted to Commander of the 10th Army Corps. Needless to say, a smile filled the face of Commander Shi, and the brothers of the 69th Army cheered again in the valleys and plains of southern Shandong.

The development and growth of the 10th Army Corps in the past two years is due to the strong leadership of Commander Shi and the bravery of the soldiers, which has enabled the 10th Army Corps to shed its old Northwest Army shell and move towards the path of a new national defense army.

Economic Knowledge

### Bullion

— Wang Xiangqin

I. Organization of the Shanghai Gold Market

The Shanghai gold trading market initially used the Gold Industry Association as its venue. It was not until after 1920 that formal gold trading market organizations were established. At that time, two were established one after another: one was the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange, and the other was the Shanghai Gold Exchange. Later, in 1937, the former was ordered to merge its gold department into the latter. Thus, the Shanghai Gold Exchange became the only gold market in Shanghai. Although the gold traded in the exchange is said to include domestic gold mines, gold bars and coins from various countries, pure gold, and bullion, etc., the daily trading volume is dominated by bullion, while the rest are traded very little. Therefore, the Shanghai gold market is actually a bullion market.

The participants who gather at the Shanghai Gold Market every day for trading include Chinese banks, foreign banks, gold brokers, gold shops, money houses, cotton yarn groups, securities groups, importers and exporters, and scattered retail customers from the local area and from various other regions. As for the trading methods in the market, they can be divided into two types: spot trading and forward trading. Spot trading is settled on the same day; forward trading is limited to two months. In the past, during its heyday, the trading volume of bullion in the Shanghai Gold Exchange was quite large, with a monthly turnover of often three to four million taels. After the implementation of the new currency policy in 1935, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the speculation in bullion in the market greatly decreased, with a sharp reduction in trading volume. The monthly turnover was only four to five thousand taels. After the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, business came to a standstill. However, since the implementation of foreign exchange control in China in early March 1938, speculators have once again used the fluctuations in the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange to manipulate the market. As a result, illegal cash transactions in the Shanghai black market have suddenly become active again. Although the government has recently promulgated laws to centralize the purchase of gold and prohibit private trading, the situation in Shanghai is special and has not been implemented. Illegal trading of bullion continues to exist.

II. Reasons for Gold Price Fluctuations

Bullion prices are closely related to foreign exchange rates and gold prices in the UK and the US. Although the US is not a gold standard country, there is still a relatively fixed relationship between the US dollar and gold. Therefore, the gold price calculated in US dollars is extremely stable. Before the outbreak of the German-Polish war, the gold price calculated in British pounds was also extremely stable. Recently, with the outbreak of the German-Polish war, the Bank of England abandoned maintaining the external value of the British pound, and the London gold price rose. Under the stable conditions of gold prices in the UK and the US, the fluctuations in Shanghai gold prices depend entirely on the tightness of foreign exchange in Shanghai: when foreign exchange is tight, gold prices rise, and vice versa. If gold prices in the UK and the US are unstable, then the changes in Shanghai gold prices closely follow the changes in gold prices in the UK and the US and the exchange rates in Shanghai, rising and falling in proportion. However, the degree of fluctuation always differs slightly from the changes in gold prices in the UK and the US and the exchange rates in Shanghai due to local supply and demand relationships. Furthermore, China currently prohibits the export of gold, and domestic gold cannot be exported and sold at high prices. Therefore, Shanghai gold prices are often lower than London gold prices. As for the parity between Shanghai bullion and London pure gold, the calculation method is as follows:

For example, on September 6, the price of British pure gold was £8 and 8 shillings, which is 2016 pence, and the black market exchange rate for British pounds in Shanghai was 4 pence and 3125/10000. The calculation of the Shanghai gold price is as follows:

III. Trends in Black Market Gold Prices

After the Shanghai Gold Exchange closed down after the "August 13th" incident, a black market soon emerged. However, gold transactions in the black market are limited to spot transactions. Since the implementation of foreign exchange control last March, the fluctuations in gold prices have become increasingly large due to the indefinite contraction and expansion of the black market for foreign exchange and the supply and demand relationship in the market. From the "August 13th" incident to March 14th of last year, before the implementation of foreign exchange control, Shanghai gold prices were extremely stable. The highest price for each tael (ten liang) of gold was no more than 1149 yuan, a very slight increase compared to before the war, and the trend was relatively moderate. However, since the government implemented foreign exchange control on March 14th of last year, the black market for foreign exchange has shrunk daily, and black market gold prices have gradually risen. By August of last year, the highest price for each tael of gold had risen to 2041 yuan, an increase of 896 yuan compared to 1145 yuan in the same period of the previous year.

Since last September, the promulgation of various regulations on the management of gold has further promoted the repeated rise in gold prices, with the highest rise reaching 2190 yuan. In June of this year, the Sino-British Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee stopped supplying foreign exchange to the Shanghai black market, the foreign exchange market shrank sharply, and gold prices rose sharply again, once reaching a record of nearly 5,000 yuan.

Recently, the German-Polish war has led to the participation of Britain and France in the war, and another European war is about to begin. Because people have learned the lesson of the previous European war, where silver was expensive and gold was cheap, they have been selling their gold holdings, causing gold prices to fall daily. On September 4th, it fell to 3070 yuan, but recently, as foreign exchange has contracted again, gold prices have begun to rise again. The future trend will depend on foreign exchange rates and gold prices in the UK and the US.

### The Salary of Emperors

— Gang

In the world today, a person who is a king or emperor often has a salary that is less than that of a businessman, a banker, or even a movie star. Please see the following survey report on the salaries of emperors from various countries around the world:

King George VI of England has an annual salary of US$3 million, which is entirely allocated by the national treasury.

The Emperor of Japan has an annual salary of US$1.3 million, and in addition, he has an annual surplus of US$4 million from his own property.

The Queen of the Netherlands has an annual salary of $700,000. She is very frugal, and her daily living expenses are similar to those of a middle-class woman.

The King of Sweden has an annual salary of $200,000, which is exactly half the salary of US President Roosevelt.

The Kings of Bulgaria and Greece have the lowest salaries. The King of Bulgaria has an annual salary of only $45,000. Although his salary is so low, he still has to maintain a large national museum and a library with his funds. The King of Greece has an annual salary of $25,000. He has to sell the grapes produced in his palace every year to maintain his daily expenses!

### A Statistic of the First World War

— Ye Hong

The European war has broken out. Whether this will lead to a second world war is still difficult to say for sure. But a second world war is inevitable sooner or later. Here, let's introduce some of the shocking statistics of the first world war:

(1) Among the belligerent countries, the number of soldiers who participated in the war reached 65 million, which is 13 times the current total population of Shanghai.

(2) The number of people who died as a result of the war was more than 10 million. The number of wounded who became permanently disabled reached as many as 24 million.

(3) The cost of the war was 120 billion marks, accounting for half of the total wealth accumulated by the hard and forced labor of many generations of all the people in Europe. If calculated according to the market price of HSBC's listing on September 2 of this year, then this cost is equivalent to more than 77 trillion 960 billion 70 million Chinese national currency: assuming that the number of people who bear this war cost is the same as the Chinese population, then each person would have to pay more than 16,400 yuan.

(4) From August 3, 1914, when France and Germany declared war, to November 11, 1918, when Germany and the Allied countries signed an armistice, the war lasted for four years, three months, and one week.

(5) A total of 19 countries participated in the war. There were 11 countries that declared war but did not fight. A total of 30 countries were caught in the whirlpool.

Anecdotes of Famous People

### British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax

— Yi Yin

Closest Friend to Gandhi - Even During a Train Derailment, He Still Ate Scrambled Eggs with Ham

Lord Halifax is the Foreign Secretary of the globally dominant British Empire. He was born in 1881 and is now 59 years old. His father, Sir Lindley Wood, was a member of the gentry of Yorkshire and a devout religious man, who served as the president of the British Church Union for fifty years. Therefore, when Halifax was young, he was deeply influenced by his father. Soon after, he was sent to Eton College, but because of his laziness, he was often punished by his teachers. To this day, when asked about it, he still smiles and nods in agreement.

After graduating from Eton College, he entered Oxford University. This is the only shortcut to becoming a politician. At that time, he met Geoffrey Dawson, who is now the editor-in-chief of The Times, and became very good friends.

In 1908, at the age of 28, he married Miss Oslaw. In 1910, he was elected to Parliament. At that time, the other officials looked down on him and ridiculed him, but after not much time, because of his perseverance and wisdom, no one dared to despise him anymore.

After the outbreak of the European War in 1914, he served as the commander of the Yorkshire Yeomanry. Later, after the end of the European War, he was appointed as the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. During his tenure, he was greatly appreciated by Baldwin. In 1922, during Baldwin's first cabinet, he served as the Minister of Education. Two years later, he was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture, and in 1926, he was again appointed as the Viceroy of India.

When this new position was announced, the British expatriates in Bombay prepared to give him a grand welcome, arranging dancing parties and concerts. But they waited and waited, and waited for a long time, but they did not see the Viceroy arrive. Later, it was discovered that he was quietly praying in a corner of a church in Bombay - something that no British Viceroy had ever done before. As soon as the prayer was over, regardless of people's anxiety and expectations, he ran straight to Gandhi's residence - this was something that a British Governor had never done before. After a short conversation, the two immediately became close friends, and to this day, they always address each other in their letters as "My Great Friend".

In 1931, he returned from India and was again appointed as the Minister of Education. After 1934, he also served as the Secretary of State for War and the Lord Privy Seal. In the recent Chamberlain cabinet, he was appointed as the Foreign Secretary.

He retains the typical nature of the British people - calmness. There is a story that still remains in people's minds: in 1929, during his tenure as the Viceroy of India, one day he had to take a train to Delhi because of some business. Unexpectedly, the train was sabotaged on the way and derailed. Everyone was terribly frightened, but he, on the other hand, did not move and peacefully ate his scrambled eggs with ham in the dining car. Therefore, the Speaker of the British House of Commons, O'Connor, often said: "Anyone who sees Halifax can know that he is an Englishman."

Like Baldwin and Gray, he also likes rural life. At the same time, he has also said that he would rather be a hunting manager than hope to be the Prime Minister. Every weekend, he always goes to his manor in Garrowby to stay for a day or two. He also likes to write. He has published a book about the ghost legends in his family's ancient castle.

He now has three sons, one daughter, and one grandson. His family is famous for longevity in Yorkshire. Halifax's grandfather lived to be eighty years old, Halifax's father lived to be ninety-five years old, and in Yorkshire, there is a very popular saying that "Halifax will be able to live ten years longer than his father." Therefore, Lord Halifax very much wants to exceed one hundred years old and enjoy the happiness of four, perhaps five generations under one roof.

### The Self-Preservation Techniques of Political Giants

— She Xing

Hiring Decoys

In ancient times, many autocratic tyrants often hired several decoys to avoid being attacked by others, to act as scapegoats. Zhang Liang's assassination of the Qin Emperor, but hitting the "deputy car," is a clear proof of this. Today, those dictators have all taken Qin Shi Huang as their teacher. They do have many enemies, but they must also have a spirit of fearlessness and often appear in front of the masses, so the profession of "decoy" has emerged.

This kind of decoy must have a face that is as similar as possible to the dictator, the same body type, and must also imitate the employer's posture when sitting and his gait when walking. These decoys are paid very well. They often appear beside the dictator under the names of aides, secretaries, chauffeurs, etc. They live very secretly, and the masses will never know of their existence. Even after they are sniped or die, the secret is still strictly guarded.

One cold winter morning in Moscow, it was the annual grand review as usual. The stands next to Lenin's tomb were packed with people. A foreign reporter stood behind the stands near the tomb. At this time, a car drove from the Kremlin gate and stopped next to the tomb. A familiar face came out of the car, "Stalin!" Everyone cheered. But as all eyes were focused on him, the reporter glimpsed a team of tall men wearing cloaks, quickly walking straight towards the back of the tomb from another door. Walking in large strides in the tightly packed crowd, that was the real Stalin. After this group of people passed, the reporter was constantly watched by two men until the inspection was completed.

Hitler initially looked down on those who hired decoys. He often said: "The German people's love for me, as well as the Blackshirts, are enough to protect me." But once, when he was crossing an iron bridge by train, he was attacked, so he immediately hired a decoy. Hitler's first decoy was the chauffeur Hilek. He died after a year, reportedly from meningitis. But four weeks later, the truth gradually emerged: it turned out that one day when Hitler was driving from Berlin to Bernau, Hitler was the driver, and Hilek replaced the German leader in the car, pressing his forehead low with a pointed hat. As the car was traveling at an intersection, suddenly a bullet flew in, and the decoy in the car fell in response. The driver immediately accelerated to drive two miles, then stopped, got out of the car, removed his hat, and told the people around him that he was Hitler.

Mussolini was very reluctant to have others die for him. But in the six dangerous situations in his life, two people died for him, namely the murder of his chauffeur in 1923, and the death of the Grand Duke of Rome a few years later.

The bravest of the decoys was the decoy of former Japanese Prime Minister Okada. That was during the February 26th Tokyo coup in 1936, when a group of machine gunners broke through the gate of Prime Minister Okada's residence and entered the locked middle gate. They shouted loudly outside the door for Okada to come out and die. At first, there was no movement. Just as they were about to break down the door, the door suddenly opened, and an old, fat, wide-mouthed man was facing them, undoubtedly Okada. Immediately, a burst of machine-gun bullets pierced his body. A few days later, the rebels were suppressed, and the entire Tokyo mourned Okada's death. Suddenly, Okada appeared in the bowl cupboard of the Prime Minister's private residence, hungry and thin, but alive. This was another case of mistaken killing by another person!

Scientific Trivia

### What You Wouldn't Expect

— Xu Jiemei

Do you know that the most peculiar thing in the world is yourself? Although I am not a fortune teller, and I have never met you, I dare to bet you five to one that I can tell you many things about yourself that you have never thought of.

Don't think that white people have Western appearances. In fact, white people have more pigment in their skin than black people, and their eyes protrude more than those of yellow people. You think that human diet is the most regular, but in fact, human food contains the most grasses.

The blood vessels in the eyes flow much faster than the blood vessels in other parts of the body, so they can work very quickly, accurately, and continuously. But you should know that your visual organ is not the eyes. What the eyes see can never be more than what a camera takes. They are only stimulated by light, concentrating the light on a sensitive part, and then the brain converts these lights into illusions. So, the visual organ is not the eyes but the brain; similarly, photography is the work of the film, not the lens box. However, vision cannot only have the brain without the eyes, just like photography, it is useless to have only the film without the lens box.

You can actually observe that the left eye of a person who is used to using their left hand is always more sensitive than their right eye. The right eye of a person who is used to using their right hand must be more sensitive than their left eye; although this is not a theorem, it is a common situation.

Even if your eyes have no problems at all, when they move, you seem to be blind, unable to see anything. For example, when you are reading a book, you read line by line. You never see the lines of words alternating; what you see are just novel images.

When you read a book, looking at the words printed on the book, what you actually see is the blank space next to the words, because the reflectivity of the blank space is much stronger than the reflectivity of the black words. So, when you see the character "〇", what you see is not a black circle, but a white circle with some blurry shadows around it on a white background.

Didn't I just tell you that white people have more pigment in their skin than black people, and their eyes protrude more than those of yellow people? This is the truth. You should know that "white" is made up of a mixture of various pigments. The light reflected by either deep purple or bright red cannot match white. Black, on the other hand, does not reflect light at all, so black people actually have the lightest skin tone.

As for the eyes, don't think that protruding eyes are a characteristic of Easterners. In fact, protruding eyes are a characteristic of all kinds of people in the world other than Easterners. Originally, Easterners' eyes are a little protruding, which is because their noses are too low. To be honest, their eyes are not as protruding as those of Westerners or Cossacks!
