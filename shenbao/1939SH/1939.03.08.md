### White-Blade Battle Occurs in Zhongxiang City; Elite Chinese Troops Gather in the Xiangfan Area; Fierce Four-Day-and-Night Battle on the Jing-Zhong Road for Seven or Eight Contested Points; Japanese Reinforcements Attempt to Invade Northward Along the Xiang River Valley; Chinese Left-Wing Forces Vigorously Attacking the Japanese

(Hong Kong) Jingmen Telegram: The battle in central Hubei continues fiercely. Japanese forces have increased to four regiments. Near the East Bridge on the Jing-Zhong Road, Chinese and Japanese troops have fought fiercely for four days and nights, contesting seven or eight points. As of the sixth, the battle continues. A certain Chinese unit in Zhongxiang was heavily attacked by the Japanese for three days. A small portion of the position was breached, but after reinforcements arrived, the situation stabilized. Currently, a certain unit on the Chinese left wing is attacking the Japanese. (Special dispatch, 7th)

(Hong Kong) The Japanese troops invading Zhongxiang continue to aggressively advance north along the highway, attempting to cross the Xiang River and harass Jingmen and Yicheng. Certain Chinese units have been reinforced and are currently counterattacking. In the vicinity of Zhongxiang, Chinese troops continue to resist. Fierce battles between Chinese and Japanese forces are also occurring near Changshou Shop, Majiaji, and Da Dai Zi Mountain north of Zhongxiang, resulting in numerous Japanese casualties. The defense of the Xiang River is secure. (Special dispatch, 3:00 AM, 8th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the situation on the Xiang River front has suddenly become tense. After a minor engagement with Japanese forces one mile southeast of Zhongxiang on Sunday night, they have invaded Zhongxiang, resulting in a white-blade battle in the city. Simultaneously, another group of Japanese troops is attacking Wangjiaji, twenty miles north of Zhongxiang. Elite Chinese troops are now gathering in the Xiangyang and Fancheng area, anticipating a Japanese advance north along the Xiang River valley. Thirteen Japanese aircraft heavily bombed Xiangyang and Fancheng yesterday morning. (Reuters, 7th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese reports, Japanese forces occupied Zhongxiang, a town on the Danshui River about 120 miles northwest of Hankou, on Sunday. A new development has occurred on the sixty-mile battle line in central Hubei. According to a Central News Agency report, the Japanese occupied Zhongxiang after suffering over a thousand casualties. Judging from the current situation, the military appears to be preparing to attack west towards Shashi. In the past two weeks, Japanese forces have forced Chinese troops within the Heshui River loop to the west bank of the Hanshui River. The Japanese are preparing to cross the Hanshui River at Zhongxiang, Jiukou, and Yuekou. Yesterday, both sides exchanged heavy artillery fire at various points along the Hanshui River. According to Chinese reports, in the two weeks before occupying the various points within the Hanshui River loop, the Japanese suffered 5,000 casualties. (Associated Press, 7th)

(Yichang) A portion of the Japanese forces that infiltrated Zhongxiang engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese defending forces for two days and nights. The Japanese used large amounts of gas and poison gas as threats and bombarded Chinese forces with intense artillery fire. Chinese forces fought bravely and advanced wave after wave. After the positions were destroyed, some troops retreated and defended more advantageous areas. Additionally, Japanese troops that advanced towards Wangjiaji and Changshou Shop have been repelled by Chinese forces. Chinese forces in the Sanyangdian area have made significant progress. Amidst defeat and chaos, the Japanese set fire to civilian houses. Although Japanese forces in Tianmen and Yuekou have slightly increased, they cannot advance due to the Chinese guerrilla forces. Chinese troops launched an offensive on the main front of the Han-Yi Road. A certain unit recaptured the important stronghold of Yangjiadong yesterday and is currently pursuing the enemy in triumph. (Telegram, 7th)

(Chongqing) According to news received here this morning, the Chinese and Japanese armies have been engaged in fierce fighting in Zhongxiang for several days, with heavy casualties on both sides. There is talk of Chinese forces shifting positions, but officials have not yet confirmed this. However, Chinese newspapers this morning provide detailed accounts of the intense street fighting in Zhongxiang, stating that Chinese forces have moved to new positions in the western suburbs, preparing to continue the resistance. Furthermore, it is reported that after occupying Zhongxiang, the Japanese will attempt to cross the Hanshui River again. They made such an attempt yesterday, but were unsuccessful. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)

(Chongqing) According to news received here, the war in central Hubei is gradually shifting north. The Japanese have an intention to attack Xiangyang and Fancheng. The fighting in the Zhongxiang area remains fierce. After three days and nights of intense fighting, Chinese forces were finally forced to withdraw from Zhongxiang yesterday due to the destruction of their fortifications. They are now holding the line at Yangzizhen and Fengle River, vigorously resisting Japanese attacks. Japanese forces at Jiukou and Duojiawan have repeatedly attempted to cross the river to attack westward, but have all been repelled by Chinese forces. There was intense artillery fire at Yuekou yesterday, but the Japanese have so far been unable to cross the Hanshui River. (Express News Agency, 7th)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Japanese forces in central Hubei have encountered strong resistance from Chinese forces on the Jing-Zhong Highway for several consecutive days, suffering heavy casualties. In the struggle for Xiaojiadian alone, Japanese casualties reached thousands. Heavy rain has been incessant in central Hubei for the past week, causing the river to overflow and the roads to become extremely muddy, rendering Japanese mechanized units completely ineffective. This is also one of the reasons for the heavy Japanese casualties. Although some of the important strongholds on the east bank of the Hanshui River have been occupied by the Japanese, the Chinese forces on the west bank are strong and their fortifications are solid. Moreover, the Dabie Mountains in northern Hubei are still under Chinese control. Therefore, it is impossible for the Japanese to cross the river and attack westward at present. After the Japanese forces advancing from Jingshan invaded Zhongxiang, they continued to advance north along the highway, attempting to coordinate with the Japanese forces in the Zhe River area to attack Xiangyang and Fancheng, important towns in northern Hubei. Yesterday, after a Chinese counterattack, they retreated to Zhongxiang. Japanese forces in the Changshou Shop area have repeatedly attempted to advance south to attack the Chinese flanks, but have all been repelled by Chinese forces. (Express News Agency, 7th)

### Xinhua Daily's Commentary: The Terrorist Acts in Shanghai are Caused by the Japanese; In Order to Attack the Public Concession, Not Out of Patriotic Zeal

(Chongqing) According to an editorial in the Communist Party's organ, Xinhua Daily, the recent terrorist acts in Shanghai were all committed by the Japanese. The purpose of these actions is to provide the Japanese with an excuse to attack the Public Concession. Chen Lu and Li Guojie both died in the extraterritorial road construction area directly controlled by the Japanese army. The assassins are guards and puppet police from Japanese-run opium dens, brothels, and gambling dens. They parade with weapons in areas under Japanese military control without interference from Japanese military police. This proves that they are mercenaries hired by the Japanese, not Chinese patriots. The atmosphere of terror created by the Japanese's "head policy" is used to make various demands on the Public Concession. The Chinese people of Shanghai know that killing only a few traitors is not of great significance for recovering lost territory and driving the Japanese out of China. The liberation of China cannot be achieved solely through assassination. This goal can only be achieved by organizing the people and uniting the strength of the government and the people.

### Japanese Aircraft Attacked Pingliang Yesterday; Also Harassed Wuwei and Yongchang; Xi'an Was Also Bombed; Details Under Investigation

A Certain Location: At 9:50 AM on the 7th, several groups of Japanese aircraft, totaling 45, were spotted in the vicinity of Pucheng, northern Shaanxi, with the intention of invading Lanzhou via Shaanxi and Gansu.

### Japan, Caught in a Dilemma, Prepares to Negotiate with the Chinese Government; Declares Itself Not an Omnipotent Country; Even the Communist Party Actually Has Proposals

(Tokyo) According to Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma's statement yesterday in the House of Representatives, if General Chiang Kai-shek and the government he leads can reconsider their anti-Japanese attitude and cooperate with Japan to establish a new order in East Asia, then Japan is prepared to negotiate with them to end hostilities. Hiranuma also said that although Japan is prepared to negotiate with the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek to end hostilities, Japan can only regard the Chongqing government as a local government and cannot regard it as the central government of China. He continued that it is necessary to re-establish the "central government" of China from scratch. After the Prime Minister spoke, Foreign Minister Arita continued in the House of Representatives, stating, "We must make the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and other countries aware of Japan's determination to establish a new order in East Asia and to achieve the status of a world power." Arita stated that Japan's foreign policy is based on the Anti-Comintern Pact. The current China Incident is due to the instigation of the Communist International, so Japan must do its utmost to deal with the Communist International. However, Arita concluded by saying that Japan is not an omnipotent country, so there is no need to adopt a hostile policy towards the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and other countries. Judging from the statements of Hiranuma and Arita, it can be seen that Japan is keenly aware of its difficult situation. Both China and the international community have the intention to accommodate the facts. If China continues its resistance, Japan will inevitably have to greatly revise its original plan and abandon its original ambitions. (Associated Press, 7th)

(Moscow) According to today's Pravda, the Japanese Communist Party has drafted a program for the party's work, completely opposing the Japanese government's plans and making various demands regarding domestic and foreign affairs: (1) The Communist Party demands peace with China, without claiming land or military expenses. (2) Withdraw troops stationed in China and "Manchukuo." (3) Abolish the Anti-Comintern Pact. (4) Sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)

### American Advisor States; The War Will Continue for Three Years; China Will Ultimately Triumph; Japan Will Never Be Able to Conquer China; Occupied Areas Cannot Establish a Government

(London) Today, Mr. Sivart, an advisor to General Chiang Kai-shek and representative of the American Congregational Church in China, told people here that the war in China will continue for another three years, and as a result China will have the final victory. He said, “The current Sino-Japanese War will continue for at least three years, and then Japan will undoubtedly prepare to negotiate peace. Japan will certainly never be able to conquer China.” Besides the regular army, China also has 2.5 million guerrillas. Japan has only occupied the ports along the coast, but all of these points are completely surrounded by Chinese guerrillas, so trade is actually impossible. Japan is really unable to establish a government in the areas it has occupied. According to Mr. Sivart, who arrived here today from China, he will pass through here on his way back to the United States. (Associated Press, 6th)

Editorial

### Respectful Greetings to the Women's World

Today is Women's Day. In extraordinary times, everyone, everything, every moment, and every place should prioritize the most urgent matters. Who still has the leisure and mood, like in previous years, like in ordinary times, to embellish and decorate when a good time or festival arrives? Originally, Women's Day is not just an embellishment for leisure and mood, but has its own profound meaning; but in the midst of the War of Resistance, "military affairs first, victory first, concentrated will, concentrated strength," in comparison, it may be fine to put Women's Day aside and not mention it. However, we especially hope that the women of China will use an extraordinary mood to celebrate this extraordinary Women's Day for the sake of the War of Resistance.

Chinese women have encountered extraordinary circumstances; not only are they not ashamed of the women of the world, but they have also made extraordinary contributions to the men of China. In terms of general activities: donating money, buying bonds, educating orphaned children, rescuing the wounded, providing relief to compatriots in the rear, and comforting the soldiers on the front lines; as well as all kinds of other work most suitable for women, they are all generous and energetic, and have already achieved remarkable accomplishments. In addition, domestically, there are groups of heroines who can endure hardship, endure hunger and cold, and are not afraid of bullets, traveling thousands of miles, directly serving in the war zone; in several provinces, military training for female recruits is being held, and countless numbers have been trained, honing their skills, and preparing to kill the enemy and achieve success. Abroad, shouting in the streets, running around to promote, gaining international sympathy; especially in the Pacific ports of the United States, not only have they participated in various anti-aggression movements, but they have also organized picket teams centered on overseas Chinese women to effectively prevent the raw materials for manufacturing murder weapons, such as scrap steel and pig iron, from being transported to Japan, and in some places, they have been completely embargoed as a result. All kinds of labors, all kinds of achievements, have almost opened up a new situation of extraordinary work for women around the world, creating a new era of women serving and saving the country! What is even more noteworthy is that all achievements and all accomplishments are by no means the achievements of three or five well-known and outstanding heroines; that is to say, they cannot be attributed to three or five well-known and outstanding heroines: in other words, the majority of women participated, were active, and made significant contributions. This is the supreme glory of the Chinese women's world!

Today is Women's Day. We have praised the majority of Chinese women for participating in extraordinary work and creating great achievements; they are truly working hard to build paradise. At the same time, we sadly commemorate the other majority of Chinese women, who have suffered shame and humiliation and made painful sacrifices; they are truly unfortunate and have fallen into a living hell. Not only that, we also know that there are even more Chinese women who, although living in extraordinary times, are outside the War of Resistance and saving the country; they are either barely surviving in an ignorant universe, or living in a drunken dream in another dark world!

For these even more Chinese women, we should not belittle them for the time being, but should awaken them. At least make them feel the necessity of the War of Resistance. If there is no War of Resistance, not only will they not be able to have the life of a concubine, but they will also be thrown into a living hell, so that they can realize that women are not only people, but also citizens; citizens have the same inescapable responsibility to the country, regardless of gender, so they must cultivate their ability to take on the responsibilities of a citizen, and enable them to understand that women are not only citizens like men, but also the mothers of citizens, so they have the responsibility to educate their children so that they do not feel ashamed to be the next generation of citizens and can take on the responsibilities of the next generation. Enable them to understand that modern society takes the family as the smallest unit of organization, and women are the main cells in each unit; the main cells must have a sound consciousness and ability, and then a sound society can be formed. They must know whether the soundness of women's consciousness and ability is directly expressed in the family they preside over, and whether the soundness of the family is directly controlled by them; but they must further know that the spirit and material of the War of Resistance and saving the country originate from the entire society within the scope of the nation, and that whether this spirit and material are abundant depends on the family as the unit of society, and on the housewives who are the main cells of the family.

Such a statement is by no means an exaggeration. For example, during the War of Resistance, conscription and labor must be promoted; how to promote them depends on the laws of the country, but the attitude of the housewives towards conscription and labor will directly affect their husbands and sons; although we do not say that this influence is more authoritative than national laws, we cannot at least deny that it affects the smooth implementation of laws. Also, for example, during the War of Resistance, the country will inevitably persuade people to donate money, raise bonds, and other levies; in addition to a part that can be enforced by national laws, the other part or most of it must be enthusiastically contributed by the people; whether they are enthusiastic or not depends on the attitude of women and how much material resources they have left over from managing the family. Also, for example, during the War of Resistance, advocating austerity and thrift and discouraging extravagance and waste are important factors in cultivating and maintaining national strength; but the key lies not in the attention of the general society, but in the practical efforts of the housewives in every family.

We firmly believe that women who are barely surviving in an ignorant universe and women who are living in a drunken dream in another dark world are by no means unwilling to love the country, and by no means unwilling to save the country; they mostly think that they are too small, and that their relationship with the country is too distant; they are not belittling themselves, but they do not know themselves. How to awaken them universally? The wise women's world should take more responsibility for this!

### Japanese Army and Navy Explain Expansion Plans, Submit Huge Budget to Parliament Yesterday, Army Completes in Five Years, Navy in Six, Aimed at China, Russia, Britain, and the United States

(Hong Kong) Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Army and Navy authorities today submitted a new military expansion budget to the Diet, totaling 1,889,133,000 yen, to be completed in five years. However, the Navy's expansion plan will be completed in six years. The Army's expansion amounts to 194,991,000 yen, of which 13,200,400 yen is for replenishing military equipment, 90,600,000 yen for reorganizing the Army Air Force, and 91,187,000 yen for modernizing military equipment. The Navy's expansion cost reaches 1,694,142,000 yen, to be completed in six years, of which 188,321,000 yen is for supplementing fleet strength, and 300,041,000 yen is for the Navy Air Force. All these supplementary budgets refer to the expenses of various projects that have already begun. (6th dispatch)

(Hong Kong) Tokyo Dispatch: Navy Minister Yonai recently stated in response to a question from a member of the House of Representatives that the Navy adheres to the principle of a strong naval armament. As for the international resistance arising from the China Incident, the Japanese naval authorities are also considering it. The Navy's preliminary budget for the next fiscal year reaches 172,800,900 yen, of which 60,150,000 yen is for building warships, 56,641,000 yen for reorganizing the naval air force, 25,320,000 yen for naval armaments factories, and 14,500,000 yen for replenishing arsenals. Yonai said that the former American Vinson Naval Armaments Act stipulated that the United States should fully expand its naval armaments to the extent permitted by naval treaties. As for the current Vinson Act, it advocates that the United States Navy's strength should be increased by 20% compared to the treaty provisions. The British Navy's warship expansion cost reaches 100 million pounds. When the Japanese naval authorities formulate a new naval armament plan, the expansion of British and American forces is taken into consideration, aiming for the strongest naval strength in the Pacific, hoping to create the strongest navy. If we can achieve this goal, we must overcome possible international resistance and hope that this resistance can be reduced to a minimum through diplomatic efforts. (6th dispatch)

(Tokyo) Japanese Army Minister Itagaki today stated in the House of Representatives his five-year plan to reorganize military equipment worth 200 million yen. This plan is to supplement the inadequacy of the seven-year military equipment replenishment plan passed by the Diet in 1937. The exact amount is 194,896,000 yen, which is scheduled to begin in the next fiscal year. The Army Minister also stated that in order to strengthen the defense of "Manchukuo," the military intends to request the Diet to allocate 368,123,000 yen, of which 79,855,000 yen will be used for "Manchukuo" to establish the Japanese Air Force. As for the use of the five-year plan to reorganize military equipment, it is as follows: (1) 13,204,000 yen for replenishing military equipment, (2) 90,605,000 yen for reorganizing the air force, (3) 91,087,000 yen for modernizing military equipment. The reason why the Army wants to reorganize the air force with huge funds this time is to make the air force under the Army's jurisdiction equal in strength to the air force under the Navy's jurisdiction.

### British New Loan to China Successful Negotiations in London Also Plans to Expand Credit Lending British Parliamentarians Concerned about Far East Affairs

(London) Negotiations on a plan for British commercial banks and several Chinese banks to jointly participate in a loan to assist Chinese currency have been underway for several weeks. This enterprise will include a huge amount of money, and it is generally believed that it is in the common interest of both parties. It is reported that the technical measures of this plan have made great progress and will be announced in the Parliament this week. (7th Reuters dispatch)

(London) Well-informed sources here recently declared that Rodgers, a senior official of the Bank of England, is negotiating with Chinese representatives to lend China 3 to 5 million gold pounds, guaranteed by the British government, to improve China's financial situation, which has been affected by the Japanese seizing a part of its tax revenue. According to reports, Rodgers accompanied Sir Leith-Ross, the government's chief economic advisor, to China in 1934, and recently toured China again, returning to London three weeks ago. (7th Havas dispatch)

(London) According to official sources here today, in order to support Chinese legal tender and use China to purchase railway tracks, machinery, tools, and other British goods, Britain has decided to make two more large loans to China. The amount of the first loan is approximately between 3 and 5 million pounds, and the purpose is to support Chinese legal tender. This loan is undertaken by the HSBC and other British banks. It is heard that a resolution to approve this loan will be submitted to the Parliament soon. According to government sources, the main purposes of this loan to China are twofold: (1) To show the consistency of British and American actions in the Far East, because the amount of this British loan to China is almost equal to the amount of the American loan to China. (2) To put pressure on the Japanese side to change its ambition to dominate the Pacific. As for the second batch, it is an expansion of credit lending for exports to China. The established credit lending is 500,000 pounds. The British side now intends to increase this lending tenfold so that China can purchase British railway materials, machinery, tools, and papermaking machines. (6th Associated Press dispatch)

### Japanese House of Peers Passes General Budget Approved

### Blocking the Pearl River Further Negotiations Submitted

(London) British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question from opposition Liberal Party MP Harris that the British government has negotiated with the Japanese government regarding the blockade of the Pearl River, but has not negotiated regarding the occupation of the Guangzhou Delta. Foreign Secretary Halifax understands the opinions of the British Chamber of Commerce in Guangzhou and is well aware of the impact of the continued existence of the current restrictive measures on the general interests of the British people. Harris also asked if Butler knew the importance of this matter and the impact on Lancashire. Butler replied that he was well aware of it, which is why he said that the British government is continuing to urge the early restoration of Pearl River navigation.

### Protecting Commercial Interests in North China

Conservative Party member Moreing asked Butler whether he was aware of the announcement issued by French, Italian, and Japanese officials on March 10 that all commercial transactions in North China must use banknotes from the United Reserve Bank. He also asked whether Butler would take measures to ban the import of goods from North China into British and British colonial ports unless they had a consular certificate proving that they were financially facilitated by British, American, and French banks, in order to resist Japanese discrimination. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax was aware of this announcement. As for the second question, the British government will consider various practical ways to protect British interests. Moreing said that what is needed now is action, not consideration. Butler replied that he would not neglect the need to take any necessary action.

### Safety of British Nationals in Yichang

Conservative Party member Marsden asked whether there was a British consul in Yichang now. If not, could the British government immediately send a consul there to protect British interests, because the Japanese army is now planning to attack Yichang. Butler replied that there was no British consul in Yichang now, but there was a British warship. The British government can rely on the captain of the warship to take the necessary measures to protect the lives and property of British nationals. If the environment requires the presence of consular personnel, Chongqing can send someone at any time. (6th Reuters dispatch)

### Local Financial Conference Minister of Finance Kong's Instructions Personnel Should Be Responsible for Supporting Local Production Undertakings Financial Institutions Should Strive to Assist Close Cooperation Between Central and Local Governments

(Chongqing) The full text of Minister Kong's instructions at the Second Local Financial Conference is as follows: Today, the Ministry of Finance has invited you to hold a symposium in Chongqing. You have come from afar, and your hard work is known. In order to adjust local finance and strengthen the war of resistance, the Ministry of Finance has held a conference and decided on many important cases, which have been quite successful in implementation. It has been more than eight months since then. During this period, the first phase of the war of resistance has just ended, and the second phase is beginning. The overall situation of the war of resistance has already had an important key. Regarding local finance, we should carefully review and make further efforts to coordinate with the military operations. The position of provincial banks and local banks is the key to promoting local finance, and they bear very important responsibilities. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance invites you here to talk, on the one hand, to understand the current financial situation in various places, and on the other hand, to propose several important issues and study and discuss them in detail with you. You are all the highest responsible persons of local financial institutions, and you must have very good opinions for reference and adoption. It is expected that the results of this discussion will also have satisfactory gains in the future. However, given the importance of local financial matters today, how to deliberate and handle the planning and promotion, I have some opinions and would like to take this opportunity to contribute to you. (1) The issue of responsibility: It is found that the current provincial and local banks, whether they are within the war zone or close to the war zone, inevitably encounter difficulties and setbacks in the progress of affairs due to environmental and factual reasons. However, this kind of difficulty is impossible and should not be avoided. In the future, personnel of local financial institutions, regardless of their position, must always recognize their own position and the importance of responsibility. They must never perfunctorily deal with what should be done. They must move forward with a spirit of sacrifice, not afraid of difficulties or hardship. For example, branches of local banks within the war zone should continue their daily operations as usual and should not withdraw before the troops withdraw. Also, if there are no branches in the location of the war zone headquarters, branches should be added to facilitate war zone finance. This kind of area is not a very safe place, but it is the responsibility, of course, there is no reason to avoid it. For example, the central government now stipulates that within the war zone, the four branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank should be the last to withdraw with the troops, and in the location of the war zone headquarters, one of the four banks should set up a branch to provide services as usual. It is hoped that the provincial and local banks should also do the same, so that there will be no stagnation in wartime finance. (2) In order to support local production undertakings and resist the economic invasion of the enemy and puppets, how to develop production undertakings, how to purchase important material raw materials, how to use provincial banknotes to circulate deeply in guerrilla areas to resist the circulation of enemy and puppet banknotes, how to collect information on enemy economic invasion, and how to use financial power to support the soundness of local finances, the above are all important issues and should be considered according to the circumstances, with quick procedures, and gradually improved and implemented. (3) Local financial institutions should effectively assist and cooperate to achieve thorough results. If they still deal with things perfunctorily and shirk their responsibilities, not only will the war of resistance be affected, but also the local economic situation will not be improved. In the past, the provincial and local banks in various provinces have made good achievements in assisting in promoting the legal tender policy, redeeming gold and silver, and promoting small-denomination banknotes. In the future, it is hoped that they will make even greater efforts and purchase materials, agricultural products, and mineral products on behalf of the central government, open national construction savings, and practice economy. All matters must be jointly committed by the central and local governments, so that we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. (4) The issue of cooperation between central and local banks and provincial and local banks: The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank should cooperate closely and help each other with local banks, such as purchasing materials, developing production, handling agricultural loans, rediscounting, and receiving banknotes. There are also many things that provincial local banks can cooperate with each other. In short, it is necessary to form a sound financial network connecting the provinces with the central government and the provinces with each other. The institutions should be integrated, and the breathing should be connected, so that the national finance can achieve the effect of overall adjustment. The above four points are quite simple. I hope that you will be responsible and cooperate with each other to cope with the current difficulties. If you have any opinions, I hope you will raise them for discussion as much as possible. With everyone's detailed research, there will be satisfactory results. (7th dispatch)

(Chongqing) Finance Minister and Executive Yuan President Kong Xiangxi addressed the National Financial Conference, urging Chinese banks to cooperate with military authorities in the war zone. Kong also said that local banks must operate as usual, and banks must not withdraw when the troops have not withdrawn. Banks should set up branches in the place where the commander-in-chief of the war zone has established a headquarters, so as to facilitate the circulation of provincial banknotes in the guerrilla area. This move will not only assist the guerrillas in fighting in these areas, but also prevent the Japanese from spreading the circulation of counterfeit banknotes. Kong urged all local banks to assist the Chinese government in carrying out its financial and economic procedures. (7th Reuters dispatch)

### Glimmer of Peace in Spain Miaja Forms New Cabinet Party, Government, and Military Leaders All Express Support Ceasefire Negotiations are Underway in Secret

Madrid The Spanish Republican government announced late last night that General Miaja, the former commander-in-chief of the government army, had formed a new cabinet, with the following lineup: Prime Minister General Miaja (former commander-in-chief), Foreign Minister Besteiros (former speaker of parliament), Defense Minister Colonel Casado (former commander of the Central Route Army), Interior Minister Carrillo (National Confederation of Labor), Minister of Justice and Propaganda Andreli (Republican Party MP), Minister of Communications and Public Works Val (leader of the National Federation of Trade Unions), Minister of Finance and Economy Marion, Minister of Education and Health Delio. (7th Haitong dispatch)

(Paris) Spanish Republican government officials here recently declared that after the establishment of the Madrid Defense Committee, they have been conducting secret negotiations with the Nationalist government to discuss the issue of surrender. (6th Havas dispatch)

Madrid Ending the Spanish Civil War is becoming more urgent tonight, due to the repulsion of most of the government's fleet and rumors that the Madrid Defense Committee has been holding peace talks with the rebel government under Franco's leadership. Therefore, it is generally believed that the Spanish Civil War is likely to come to an end. The most popular reports among French people here are that General Casado, the Minister of Defense of the Defense Committee, has made a peace proposal to General Franco in Burgos. It is said that this proposal is based on the basis of freedom, independence, and reconciliation. It is also said that the government army hopes that the rebel leaders will be able to raise a glorious peace proposal in their reply, especially allowing "Spain to gain freedom from foreign countries and allies." (6th Associated Press dispatch)

(Paris) Spanish Parliament Speaker Barrio remains in France today. He hinted today that Nationalist leader General Franco and the Republican army will soon compromise. According to Barrio, Republican Army Commander General Miaja is "the person who can compromise with General Franco and make Spain regain peace." Barrio mentioned the new Defense Council and said that he was sure that the council fully agreed on the issue of stopping the war. (6th Reuters dispatch)

Madrid After General Miaja formed a new cabinet, the Air Force under the Republican Army issued a declaration expressing its absolute support and unconditional obedience. (7th Haitong dispatch)

Madrid The leaders of the front-line troops in Madrid all arrived at the general headquarters this morning to assist the National Defense Council. General Casado, who is responsible for the establishment of this council, has received the approval of the heads of all military regions, civil administrations, and political parties by telephone, except for the Communist Party. The Negrín Cabinet has now resigned, and some former cabinet members are now coming here. If the National Defense Council needs and accepts their cooperation, they will assist. According to reports from civil administrations, everything is peaceful in all provinces under their jurisdiction. Today, several Communist Party centers in Madrid have had cordon lines set up around them to prevent unauthorized persons from approaching or entering. The public here has expressed their support for the new committee. The city is also peaceful, with six-inch light cannons and machine guns erected at street corner intersections. The troops are also guarding the barracks, but there is no sign of rebellion, turmoil, or opposition. Public affairs are as usual. The people of Madrid are now wondering what steps will be taken next, because they believe that the possibility of ending the civil war without bloodshed is far from the distant future when former Prime Minister Negrín was in power. (6th Reuters dispatch)

### Casado Issues Letter to Frontline Soldiers Earnestly Appeals for a Glorious Peace to Maintain the Freedom and Independence of the Motherland

Madrid General Casado, the leader of the newly formed National Defense Council, issued a declaration to the Spanish soldiers in the trenches, earnestly appealing for peace to maintain the independence of Spain. It stated that the die has been cast, and everything depends on us to seek a way out of the deadlock with our own will. The Spaniards must now choose between purposeful freedom and destructive slavery, and between peace that is beneficial to Spain and a war that is a lackey of crazy imperialism. Our struggle must end when the independence and security of Spain are guaranteed. The Spanish people will never lay down their arms until they have obtained a guarantee of innocent peace. General Casado is now speaking on behalf of millions of people who are willing to fight to the death to preserve the independence of Spain, so as to avoid our country from falling into the ocean of red blood, hatred, and persecution, and to seek a free Spain for future generations, free from the tyranny of foreign nightmares. The declaration concludes: If you offer us peace, you will see that we have the chivalrous hearts of Spaniards. If you continue to fight against the doctors, you will see that we have deep vigilance, great hatred, and self-confidence, as tenacious as a sharp steel sword. (6th Reuters dispatch)

### Ceasefire Terms Still No More Than Three Points Amnesty Is Not Hopeless

Madrid The attitude of the Defense Council hereafter may not be very different from that of the former government. In other words, it should still negotiate peace with the Nationalist government and not allow unconditional surrender. As for the basis of the negotiations, it is still no more than three points: (1) Foreign combatants withdraw from Spain, (2) The Nationalist government promulgates an amnesty decree, (3) A referendum is held to determine the future political system. Among the people of the Republican government, the second point is the most important because they fear large-scale retaliation from the Nationalist government. Regarding this, General Franco's remarks to the British Sunday Chronicle the other day seemed to have been more tactful, and the recent broadcast messages from the Nationalist radio station have also mentioned the issue of amnesty, which shows that the future is not hopeless. (6th Havas dispatch)

Burgos Today, it is extremely difficult to understand the meaning of the bizarre developments in the Spanish Republican army area. Although the nature of the newly established Defense Council has shown the expulsion of communist elements, the broadcast remarks made by its leaders still seem to have the intention to continue the war if the Nationalist army firmly refuses to give surrender conditions. The leaders of the new Defense Council, Casado and Miaja, are both military men and should know that the war of resistance is bound to fail. Therefore, according to the opinions of people here, the organization of the Defense Council is just a mechanism for formulating the final surrender plan, and it is believed that the trend in Madrid is now between anarchy and orderly surrender. (6th Reuters dispatch)

(London) "The Daily Mail" reported that "General Miaja and General Casado have sent personnel to contact General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army, to explore the possibility of establishing peace, saying that the power of the Communist Party has been eliminated and the remaining Republican government has been fundamentally abolished." However, it is heard that General Franco's intention is that after the ceasefire between the two sides, both General Miaja and General Casado should go abroad, which is the main difficulty at present.

### Western Republic Government: The Cause and Effect of the Coup d'état – An Act Actually Containing Anti-Communist Sentiments; Negrín Flees to France in Haste for Switzerland

(Paris) The downfall of the Negrín cabinet of the Spanish Republican Government was long expected by diplomatic circles here and is not surprising. Since the Spanish President Azaña had already resigned and the parliament was unable to convene the legal number of members, it was impossible for the Negrín cabinet to exercise executive power in accordance with the constitution. In addition, former Prime Minister Negrín's prestige plummeted after the loss of Catalonia. On the 4th of this month, he decided to place the government forces under his personal command, effectively establishing a dictatorial regime, and appointed communists to important military positions, which led to the coup. For example, the mutiny of a part of the garrison in the port of Cartagena was caused by the appointment of the communist Colonel Rodríguez as the commander of the fortress in that port. On the contrary, the reputation of General Casado, the interim chairman of the National Defense Council, grew daily. Before the coup, he was in charge of leadership in Madrid, and no one was better suited for the role. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)

Madrid After the establishment of the "National Government," the city is very peaceful. Although some communists wanted to cause disturbances, they failed due to the authorities' careful prevention. There are two distinctive features of this coup that must be mentioned: first, all parties and factions are united to resist foreign ideologies; second, all parties and factions want to establish peace talks with the National Military Government under honorable conditions. Now, the authorities of the provinces under the jurisdiction of the government forces and the military leaders have all come forward to respond, so there is no fear of reaction. According to informed sources, this matter has been brewing for some time and has an anti-communist nature. As late as the 12th of last month, when the cabinet members of the Republican government returned to Madrid from France, the left-wing Republicans took the lead in expressing their opposition to the Negrín cabinet. At that time, the parties could be roughly divided into three factions: (1) The left-wing Republicans, i.e., the moderates, planned to urge President Azaña to return to the country to preside over the government and dissolve the Negrín cabinet. (2) The Socialist General Labor Union and the Anarchist Labor Federation advocated respecting the constitution. (3) The Communist Party unconditionally supported the Negrín cabinet and disregarded the constitution. At that time, eight of the twelve cabinet members disagreed with Prime Minister Negrín. Until the 17th of last month, all parties and factions jointly issued a statement condemning the actions of the Communist Party and refusing to cooperate with them. Unexpectedly, Prime Minister Negrín stubbornly refused to change his mind and appointed Communist Party members to important military positions. At this point, all parties and factions could no longer tolerate it and, under the leadership of General Casado and Besteriro, jointly overthrew the Negrín cabinet and replaced it with the National Defense Council. Former Prime Minister Negrín and other important figures also boarded planes and fled to France in haste. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)

(Paris) Former Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican Government, Negrín, along with former Foreign Minister Del Vayo, arrived here this morning. Negrín immediately transferred to Switzerland. (Havas dispatch of the 7th)

(Paris) Former Spanish Prime Minister Negrín and former Foreign Minister Vayo arrived here at 9:00 this morning. In order to avoid the crowds waiting at the Austerlitz train station, they disembarked at the Austerlitz military station and took a car here. The French authorities have warned them that they must not engage in political activities while in France. Negrín said that he has given up his Spanish political positions and is traveling in a private capacity. (Associated Press dispatch of the 7th)

### Czech President Seeks to Curb Pan-Ukrainian Movement; Reorganization of the Autonomous Government of Ukraine Province; Czech Republic and Poland Maintain Old Friendship

Prague President Hácha recently dismissed Levan, the Minister of Transportation of the Autonomous Province of Carpathian Ukraine, and ordered the reorganization of the provincial government, with former Prime Minister Volosin as Prime Minister and Minister of Justice and Education, Borscana as Minister of Interior and Finance and Transportation, and Klogulak as Minister of Commerce and Agriculture, Public Works, and Social Welfare. Informed sources here recently commented that President Hácha's actions are intended to curb the Pan-Ukrainian movement and consolidate the position of the Czech people. This can be seen from the dismissal of Transportation Minister Levan (the leader of the Pan-Ukrainian movement) and the succession of the Czech Borscana to his post. Political figures here say that in addition to maintaining friendship with Germany, the Czech Republic also wants to maintain good neighborly relations with Poland, because there is also a Pan-Ukrainian movement within Poland, so as to jointly curb this movement.

### US Naval Warfare Director Insists on Fortifying Guam; Senate Passes Air Force Expansion Bill, Increasing Army Aircraft to 6,000

(Washington) Naval Warfare Director Leahy spoke to the Senate Naval Committee today, reiterating the Navy Department's desire for Congress to approve its plan to construct defensive fortifications on Guam Island, saying that the island's strategic position makes it an invaluable defense base that can effectively deter any foreign hostile actions against Hawaii or the US mainland. Guam Island's terrain is extremely strategic, and aircraft and submarines can use it as a base to protect American overseas trade from the Dutch East Indies. It is especially appropriate for the United States to use Guam Island as a US naval station after withdrawing from the Philippines in 1945. Those who oppose this plan are actually based on the mistaken notion that strong defensive measures are currently easy to arouse suspicion. Leahy said that this plan, as mentioned before, involves the construction of new seawalls and the improvement of aircraft facilities. The procedure for the island's defensive fortifications has been submitted to the Senate for approval in a 650 million dollar bill to improve naval aircraft facilities in several islands, including those in the Central Pacific. This bill is the same as the 470 million dollar Air Force base bill recently passed by the House of Representatives, except that the House of Representatives deleted the clause in the bill that stipulated the development of Guam Island.

### Britain and Japan Sign an Agreement to Resume Navigation Between Canton and Hong Kong; Little Benefit to British Trade, Only Passengers Carried Temporarily, No Goods

Hong Kong Correspondent Since the fall of Guangzhou, the traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong has been completely cut off. For several months, the commercial losses suffered by Britain have been enormous. Hong Kong is the only base for British trade with South China, and Guangzhou is the only gateway for foreign goods to enter South China. Now that the traffic between Hong Kong and Guangzhou has been cut off by the Japanese army, British goods cannot be imported into South China. Therefore, since October of last year, the trade volume in Hong Kong has been greatly reduced. Goods shipped to Hong Kong by various foreign firms are stored in warehouses, business is stagnant, and everyone is complaining. The British authorities have repeatedly protested against the Japanese army's cutting off of navigation between Guangdong and Hong Kong and blockading the Pearl River. However, the Japanese army's offensive in South China, another purpose of which is to plunder Britain's market in South China and cut off the connection between Hong Kong and the inland areas of Guangdong Province, has always perfunctorily dealt with the British protests. On the one hand, it uses military transport to load a large number of Japanese goods and transport them to the occupied areas for dumping, in order to fulfill its long-standing wish to seize the British market and replace it. In January of this year, people in the Hong Kong shipping industry circulated rumors that traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong would soon be restored. At that time, the Kinshan vessel once went to Guangzhou for a trial run, but afterwards there was no news. The Kinshan vessel was docked at the Hong Kong wharf, still silent. Until last week, the Kinshan vessel set sail again to Guangzhou, and one day a Japanese vessel sailed from Hong Kong to Guangdong, carrying ordinary passengers, but not cargo. At this time, people in the shipping industry leaked the news again, saying that the British and Japanese sides had formally signed an agreement on the resumption of navigation between Guangdong and Hong Kong. According to the reporter's investigation, it was learned that the signing of this agreement was indeed a fact. The place where the agreement was signed was in Guangzhou. The British side who signed the treaty was the Consul General stationed in Shamian, Guangzhou, and the Japanese side was also the Consul General stationed in Guangzhou. The content is strictly confidential, and outsiders do not know it. However, regarding the permanent navigation of ships between Guangdong and Hong Kong, the agreement stipulates that British vessels may sail from Hong Kong to Guangzhou once every two weeks, while Japanese vessels may sail from Hong Kong to Guangdong once every week. Whether it is a British vessel or a Japanese vessel, when going to Guangdong and coming to Hong Kong, it is only allowed to carry passengers with a small amount of luggage, and it is not allowed to carry cargo. In fact, although Guangdong and Hong Kong have been opened to navigation, there is still no benefit to British commerce. Japanese merchant ships can come and go like British ships, and they travel twice as often as British ships. The British side is probably just relieved that it is better than nothing. It is said that the British side made such a huge concession on the resumption of traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong because it had no choice. When the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou and cut off navigation on the Pearl River, Britain immediately made a serious protest to Japan, demanding the complete opening of the Pearl River. The Japanese side refused on the one hand, and on the other hand, it expressed friendship to the Portuguese government of Macau. The two sides repeatedly negotiated the construction of a railway from Guangzhou to Macau, so that Guangzhou and other parts of Guangdong Province under Japanese occupation would have another trading port. Once this news came out, the British attitude became moderate. On the one hand, it tried its best to promote the partial opening of the Pearl River, and on the other hand, it made concessions to allow Japanese ships to travel between Guangdong and Hong Kong. Although the British side suffered considerable losses, it was also forced by the situation.

### Bishop Yu Bin Promotes Aid to China and Disaster Relief in the United States; Holds a 100-Ambulance Movement

Washington News Bishop Yu Bin arrived in the United States capital on the 13th of last month, had lunch with the Pope's representative to the United States, and met with a group of reporters at the Chinese Embassy, ​​publishing a major written speech, correcting the false claims made by the Japanese in international propaganda that China was being communist. After Bishop Yu left the United States last year, the Japanese dispatched special officials to the United States to sabotage Bishop Yu's work, spread rumors of an "anti-communist" war, and agitated the emotions of American isolationists in an attempt to oppose the US government's aid to China and sanctions against Japan. Over the past year, the Japanese conspiracy has been quite effective. Therefore, after Bishop Yu arrived in the United States, he strongly refuted the Japanese conspiracy, so that the American people understood that China's war of resistance was not only for survival, but also for humanity and justice. The Japanese fallacy of an "anti-communist war" is like Hitler and Mussolini advocating "anti-communism" while actually overthrowing democratic politics, expanding territory, and carrying out their policy of aggression. After Bishop Yu arrived in New York, various overseas Chinese organizations asked him to give speeches. He had extremely accurate analyses of China's military, diplomatic, political, economic, and financial aspects since the War of Resistance, and used objective facts to prove that China would win in the end. The original manuscript has been published in various American newspapers, and the patriotic sentiment of overseas Chinese has increased day by day. On the Lunar New Year's Day "February 19," overseas Chinese in New York, under the leadership of Bishop Yu, held a "100-Ambulance Movement Rally." After Bishop Yu's speech, more than 10,000 people participated in the parade. After the parade, more than 20,000 US dollars were raised within four hours, creating an unprecedented feat. In addition to contacting organizations related to China and fundraising, Bishop Yu also visited influential leaders in the American government and the public, such as US President Roosevelt, American Red Cross President Davis, and Columbia University President Dr. Butler, all of whom have been met. He plans to go to major cities to promote the movement to aid China and provide disaster relief in the future.

Zhejiang Eastern Travelogue (5)

### Water Transport Hub, Commercial Center: Lanxi, Over Half of the County's Conscripts Trained, Flower Boat Women Eagerly Participate in Training

From Jinhua to Lanxi, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has the Jin-Lan branch line, which can be reached in only about an hour. Lanxi used to belong to Jinhua Prefecture, but the prefecture was abolished and became a county after the Republic of China. By the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the Zhejiang Provincial Government designated it as an experimental county. After several years of hard work, the townships in Lanxi County have good organization and order. Lanxi is a large city with hundreds of thousands of people. In addition to the county seat, Youbu, Zhuge, Yongchang, Nubu and other places are very lively towns. Moreover, the towns and the county seat are connected by highways and automobiles, making it an important place in eastern Zhejiang.

Establishment of Alcohol Factory

Lanxi is the central hub of the Wu (Jinhua), Qu (Quzhou), and Yong (Ningbo) ports. The county seat is located at the junction of the three ports. Therefore, Zhejiang's commerce is centered on Ningbo in the coastal area, Hangzhou in the inland, and Lanxi is the center for freight transport in the canal area of eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, today's Lanxi is not only an important hub for water transport due to the wartime environment, but also a gathering place for commerce in eastern Zhejiang, which is becoming more prosperous. Lanxi County's agricultural products amount to more than 2.6 million dan per year, with sugarcane as the main specialty, producing about 160,000 dan per year. Handicrafts are very developed, including papermaking, oil pressing, tobacco, sugar, ham, and livestock. In terms of industry, there are also several factories. Recently, people from Jinhua and Lanxi jointly established an alcohol factory. It is said that the quality of the products is excellent. This emerging wartime industry should also be valued by us.

Women's Mobilization

The enthusiasm of the local people is no less than that of other places. In terms of society, the County Party Department and People's Education Center have established national salvation organizations in various towns, encouraging residents of various towns to actively donate money to save the country. When the reporter asked at the People's Education Center, it was said that since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, they have actively organized the local people and began to guide residents in the urban area on air raid and poison gas prevention and first aid methods. Now, they are still carrying out plans to organize the people, hoping that every Lanxi person can have sufficient wartime knowledge and national salvation ideas. At the same time, women are also quite organized. In addition to women's first aid classes, they also plan to train the flower boat women of Lanxi, because there are many flower boats on the banks of the Lanxi River. According to a recent survey by the county government, there are twenty-one flower boats in the urban area, with ninety women, mostly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one. However, among these ninety flower boat women, only nine can read, and only eight have some embroidery skills. The rest are illiterate and have no skills. Moreover, these flower boat women are mostly idle, so there are plans to actively train them so that they can also serve the country. Secondly, in the northwest Chenglong area of Lanxi (including Shangxi Lower Street Yiqian Beijin Street Lower Chang Street, etc.), there are eighty-nine tea houses, which employ tea girls to serve tea customers, totaling one hundred and thirty-two tea girls. Most of these tea girls are between the ages of seventeen and nineteen, so they are also taught first aid knowledge to serve the country. At the same time, most of the flower boat women and tea girls are very willing to receive this training. This spirit is indeed worthy of respect.

Visiting Yongchang

Lanxi has a night market, which is very lively in places like West Main Street. Several newly opened foreign goods stores use neon lights for their signs. Even at night, the streets are still crowded with people. When the reporter passed the city tower, which housed a public library, he went up to visit. Many people were reading, and there were many newspapers from various places. On the bookshelves, there were several newly published magazines. Lanxi also has its own newspaper, which is similar in content and format to the Jinsheng Daily of Jinhua. According to statistics, Lanxi County has 52,235 people. In the county's ninety-three townships, they are divided into districts for training. "Yongchang is an important town in Lanxi," the reporter crossed the river and took a highway bus to visit it. The journey took about sixty minutes. After getting off the bus, there was a winding country road, and further in was a lively cross street. The city appearance was quite neat, with large shops on both sides. On the street, I found the town government office and went in to visit. According to the local town head, "The rules for conscripting men in this town are very strict. Regardless of rich or poor households, all those of conscription age must be sent for training. They cannot pay for substitutes or deliberately shirk. At this time of national hardship, we cadres must not be casual, otherwise, we will be sorry to the country. A large number of conscripts in this town have been trained. As for the people's ideas of saving the country in the town are very high, so they are very willing to donate money to raise public bonds." In an inland township, such a spirit is also worthy of respect.

Impressions of This Trip

In summary, this simple outline is very sufficient to show that today's eastern Zhejiang, although in the military rear, its entire organization still maintains a very sound structure. The economy, politics, and public organization of various places are all on the road to progress. We know that in order to obtain the final victory, we need a solid front line and a stable rear. The soundness of social organizations and the intensity of public sentiment in various places in the rear of China today are clear symbols of obtaining the final victory. (End)

### Special Products of Fujian Province Temporarily Allowed to be Transported to Shanghai, Regulations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs

Fuzhou Correspondence: The main products of Fujian Province are wood, tea, paper, and bamboo. The prosperity and decline of the province's economy depends entirely on the smooth sale of these four special products. Since the outbreak of the war, wood and bamboo have been very popular in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai, while tea and paper have been very popular in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Dalian. In particular, the fir business has been the most developed. In the past year, more than thirty new machine sawmills have been established in Fuzhou, with no less than ten thousand sawmill workers. Even the timber logs felled in the upper reaches of the Min River are not enough for the sawmills in Fuzhou to cut. The sawn timber boards from the factories in Fuzhou are not enough for export. According to timber merchants, these exported timber boards are all used for the reconstruction of houses destroyed by the war in the northern and southern guerrilla areas. Recently, due to orders prohibiting the export of wood, tea, paper, and bamboo from February 1, the four business groups are very panicked. Led by the Chamber of Commerce, they sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Provincial Government, appealing for a change in the method and temporarily allowing exports to maintain the local economy. The sawmills immediately announced a shutdown from February 1, and all sawmill workers were unemployed. The timber rafts stranded in the upper reaches of the Min River dared not sail downstream, reaching more than 3 million yuan. The commercial economy suffered a blow, and it was suddenly hindered. On the 18th, the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that the bamboo, wood, tea, and paper products from Fujian could be transported to the Shanghai concession area. Before the examination and approval procedures for the ban on the transportation of materials to the enemy to Shanghai are determined, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce or the Chamber of Commerce at the place of origin, and the relevant industry trade associations, shall issue a certificate guaranteeing that the items will not be used to aid the enemy. The reporting merchant shall submit the certificate to the Customs for verification and release. The County Chamber of Commerce immediately notified the wood, tea, paper, and bamboo trade associations to comply. Timber merchants said that Tianjin and Shanghai each account for half of the sales. Although Shanghai is now allowed to start shipping, Tianjin is still prohibited. Therefore, it is still temporarily unable to fully resume operations. However, the timber rafts stranded in the upper reaches of the Min River have been approved by the Min Customs and the Department of Finance to record the various taxes first and transport them to Fuzhou for sawing, and then make up the payment when exporting, to show consideration. The tea and paper merchants have jointly launched a joint venture company to prepare for sales to neighboring provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang to make up for the losses.

### Trade Association in Ningbo Purchases Local Products

Ningbo Correspondence: The Ningbo Branch of the Trade Committee of the Ministry of Finance has recently stated that since the Zhejiang Customs announced a ban on the transportation of local products from eastern Zhejiang that can be easily exchanged for foreign exchange to Shanghai, most of them have been stranded in Ningbo and cannot be shipped as scheduled. Now, in order to help farmers and merchants and increase foreign exchange, the branch has submitted a report to the General Assembly for approval and will begin purchasing. Yesterday, the branch sent a document to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, instructing relevant merchants to register with the branch first, and then purchase at a price.

### Chinese Army Attacked Changshu in Fierce Battle at Phoenix Mountain

Changshu Correspondence: The national salvation army, composed of over two thousand men from the Yuan and Guo armies active in the Yu (Yu county) and Cheng (Jiangyin county) areas, stormed into the western suburbs of Changshu at dawn on the 3rd. The Changshu Japanese garrison hastily fought back, lasting eight hours and gradually showing signs of collapse. Later, the Hirose unit of the Japanese army from Suzhou reinforced them, and the two sides fought fiercely again in the Phoenix Mountain area. The Japanese army suffered about a hundred casualties, while the Chinese side also suffered some losses.

### Ministry of Education's Review of Popular Reading Materials in the Past Two Years, Editing Standards Divided into Three Categories, Increased Compilation of Wartime Popular Reading Materials, 170 Approved

(Chongqing Correspondence) The Ministry of Education's review of popular reading materials in the past two years, according to the Central Administration Director of the Ministry, Mr. Chen Lijiang, is as follows:

Editing Standards: The Ministry of Education considers popular reading materials as an important tool for implementing social education. Since December 1936, it has begun to work on planned editing and reviewing. At that time, it formulated several important items for the editing of popular reading materials as follows: (1) The purpose of editing is to enable people who have received basic education (graduates of public schools) to continue their education from a wide range of simple and interesting reading materials, so as to (a) develop national consciousness, (b) cultivate national morality, (c) instill scientific knowledge, (d) increase practical knowledge. (2) Editing principles: (a) Content: (i) At least one of the editing purposes must be met; (ii) It is sufficient to arouse the enthusiasm of the people to strive for progress, and there is no negative, pessimistic, romantic, solitary, timid, etc. effect; (b) Form: (i) The writing must be popular, upright, and vivid; (ii) The words used must be based on commonly used words by the people. Only when it is unavoidable, uncommon words should not be used; (iii) Punctuation marks must be added; (iv) Each volume should be 8,000 to 15,000 words, but dramas, songs, drum books, ditties, etc. are not subject to this limit. (3) Types of reading materials are divided into three types: (a) Popular Knowledge Library, for supplementing the knowledge of the people, including Party ideology, society, nature, self-cultivation, and application. It is written in simple vernacular and can be interspersed with pictures; (b) Comic strips, for imparting knowledge to the people who are not very literate. The content is divided into categories similar to the Popular Knowledge Library. It is written in clear and vivid books, and the inserted text should be shallow and concise; (c) Popular Literature, for providing the people with leisure reading, with the purpose of cultivating the mind and stimulating national consciousness. All ancient and modern celebrities' good words and deeds, patriotic historical facts, and folk legends can be selected as topics. Regardless of whether the content is one person or several people's facts, or part of their facts, as long as they meet the purpose, they can be freely adopted. The title of the book is self-proposed, and the editing style can be freely adopted, regardless of novels, stories, dramas (Peking Opera, Kun Opera, spoken drama), drum books, songs (folk songs, Taoist rhymes, lotus flowers), dittyies (Wugengtian, Twelve Months of Flowers, etc.) can be adopted. (4) Editing method: In addition to the Ministry of Education editing itself, and collecting existing reading materials, reviewing and revising them, the above various types can also be made public to solicit contributions. In addition to popular literature, applicants can self-propose book titles and edit them. For the other two types, they can select one or several types according to the book titles proposed by the Ministry of Education, but other good works are also welcome. Cash will be paid for all submissions.

Review Process: In the past two years, in accordance with the above-mentioned important items for editing and proposed book titles, the Ministry has engaged in reviewing and editing. In the Knowledge Library, it has obtained 97 self-edited and solicited manuscripts, of which 55 have been reviewed and adopted. In comic strips, in addition to reviewing hundreds of types popular on the market, it has obtained 28 self-edited and solicited manuscripts, of which 13 have been reviewed and adopted. In popular literature, in addition to reviewing the old reading materials popular on the market, it has obtained 3 self-edited and solicited manuscripts, of which 8 have been reviewed and adopted. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the whole country rose up. The Ministry of Education, urgently needed, added a category of wartime popular reading materials to stimulate national consciousness, strengthen the will to resist Japan, and supplement wartime knowledge. From September 1937 to the most recent, it has obtained 45 self-edited manuscripts. After April 1938, it also designated a number of teachers from specialized schools and above in the registered war zone to temporarily undertake the editing and reviewing of popular reading materials, totaling 45 types of popular knowledge library and 4 types of comic strips. In total, in the past two years, in addition to purchasing popular reading materials on the market for review, it has obtained 232 self-edited and solicited manuscripts, of which 170 have been reviewed and adopted.

When the above manuscripts are completed, printing will be carried out at the same time. Initially, when the Ministry of Education was in Nanjing, it was agreed that Shanghai Beixin and Guangyi Bookstores would be responsible for printing separately. Unexpectedly, during the fierce battle in Shanghai, the two bookstores had difficulties in their work. Not only was there no hope of publishing books, but also part of the original manuscripts were lost as a result. Therefore, Zhenzhong Bookstore was re-assigned to undertake the printing. As of recently, 40 types of wartime popular series have been printed. Regarding promotion methods, after each type is printed, Zhenzhong will send 50 copies to the Ministry of Education and send 50 to 200 copies to the education departments of various provinces and cities so that the Ministry of Education and the education departments of various provinces and cities can distribute them to their subordinate educational institutions for application. The rest will be left to the bureau to be responsible for the sale. This is roughly the process of the Ministry of Education editing and reviewing popular reading materials in the past two years. Recently, the Ministry of Education has set up a Popular Reading Materials Group under the Textbook Editing Committee to promote wartime social education, because popular reading materials are more important. After reviewing the past, the process is briefly described above.

### Recent Situation of Universities in Various Places

Chengdu: Since the private Guanghua University was established in Chengdu, there are more than 600 students in the university and middle school departments. On New Year's Day in 1939, the university department was first moved to the newly built school building in the western suburbs of Chengdu for classes.

Zhengjiang: The National Sun Yat-sen University has selected Zhengjiang, Yunnan Province as the school site. It has previously sent staff to establish offices in Kunming, Longzhou, Hong Kong and other places to carry out preparations. Classes started in February of this year.

Lantian: After the National Normal College was established in Lantian, Hunan, students arrived at the college one after another. The Ministry of Education previously uniformly enrolled students and distributed 171 new students. Classes have been going on for a long time. On February 14 this year, a supplementary opening ceremony was held. Principals of various middle schools in Hunan were in Lantian for a meeting and all participated, making it a grand event. The nine newly built classrooms of the college were also named at the completion ceremony held on the same day.

Yishan: The National Zhejiang University moved to Yishan last autumn and started classes on November 1. The new students did not start classes until January 1 this year because the houses were insufficient and could not be built in time. This year, many teachers have been added and the tutor system has been actively promoted. The Ministry of Education has distributed new students, and as of this month, 299 have arrived at the school.

Kunming: The National Tongji University was ordered to move to Yunnan and temporarily used the outside of the East Gate of Kunming as the general office of the school. The school buildings and equipment have gradually been prepared and classes will resume on March 1. The Tangshan Institute of Technology of National Jiaotong University has moved from Hunan to Yunnan. All staff and students have arrived in Guizhou safely. Because there are no suitable buildings in Longzhou and there is no transportation, they have gone to Guizhou to transfer to Yunnan.

Guiyang: The National Jiangsu Medical College has established an office in Guiyang, inside the East Gate. New students will be gathered there. The school site is being selected.

Chongqing: The private Wuchang China University has moved from Yichang to Chongqing and found a school building on the South Bank.

Hong Kong: The private Lingnan University has resumed classes in Hong Kong and borrowed part of the school buildings of the University of Hong Kong.

### Zhejiang Education Department Re-divides Social Education Guidance Areas, Closely Links Educational Facilities to Enhance Public Resistance Strength

In order to adapt to the actual environment, the Zhejiang Department of Education has re-divided the social education guidance areas according to the convenience of transportation as follows: The Ningbo People's Education Center of the province guides the social education of Xiangshan, Nantian, Ninghai, Dinghai, and Zhenhai counties. The Zhongshan People's Education Center of Yin County guides the social education of Yin County, Fenghua, Cihao, Shangyu, Yuyao and other five counties. The Haimen People's Education Center of Linhai County guides the social education of Linhai, Huangyan, Wenling, Tiantai, and Xianju counties. Although the guidance areas have been divided, all educational facilities still seek close connections to enhance public resistance strength.

### Education Group's Fundraising Campaign, Enthusiastic Participation from All Walks of Life

Yesterday was the seventh day of the fundraising campaign for the refugee production and education funds of the education group. Participation from all walks of life was even more enthusiastic. The employees of Taikoo Yanghang felt that the original charity badges were not enough, so they continued to receive them yesterday. The employees of the Postal Administration also started to promote it yesterday. It is expected that with the large number of employees in the bureau, the results will be remarkable. The China Travel Service has also actively purchased and received charity badges. It is especially encouraging to see people from all walks of life automatically donating money to the Shanghai Bank to receive charity badges. It is reported that the fundraising campaign will end the day after tomorrow. It is still hoped that all walks of life will make their final efforts to benefit the refugees.

### School Overview: Daozhong Women's Supplementary School

The Daozhong Women's Supplementary School on Avenue Road was established sixteen years ago as a half-day supplementary class for women affiliated to Daozhong Girls' School. The original site was on Qujiang Road in Zhabei. At that time, there were no such schools in Shanghai. It gave adult women the opportunity to study while taking care of housework. The class pioneered supplementary education for women in Shanghai. In addition to the main subjects such as Chinese, English, and mathematics, it also taught skill subjects such as sewing, embroidery, and home economics. For a time, many students enrolled. The school building was destroyed in the fire in January 28. Principal Cui Jianwu planned for a long time and moved the school to its current address for reconstruction. After the chaos, those who carried books came in droves, even more than in the old days. In August 1933, the board of directors decided to expand the classes and rename it Daozhong Women's Supplementary School, with ordinary and vocational departments. The ordinary department is divided into three classes: senior, intermediate, and junior, and compulsory subjects such as Chinese, English, mathematics, bookkeeping, housekeeping, and letters are taught. The vocational department is divided into five subjects: sewing, embroidery, weaving, shorthand, and typing. The equipment is well-equipped, the management and teaching are strict, and in order to take care of poor women who are interested in studying, there are also methods for applying for tuition reduction and exemption for relief. It is reported that since this semester, the school has added school buildings and hired many teachers with both academic experience and excellence, and is actively moving forward. Therefore, the number of students has increased sharply, exceeding the records of previous years.

### Shanghai Education Society Professor's Proposal for the National Education Conference (II)

A proposal for reforming senior high school curricula to suit individual needs, enhance vocational effectiveness, and focus on preparation for higher education.

(Reasons) The existing senior high school curriculum is unable to suit individual needs due to the overly simple grouping methods. Furthermore, it cannot satisfy the preparatory requirements for various academic departments and vocational schools. The incomplete establishment of vocational subjects makes it impossible to enhance vocational effectiveness. The lack of adjustment in subject allocation makes it impossible to achieve both the goals of higher education and employment. To eliminate the above shortcomings, the existing senior high school curriculum should be fundamentally reformed.

(Methods) (1) Prescribe the minimum essential elements of each subject as common required courses, with the following implementation methods: A. Civics: according to the current curriculum standards, except that one hour of international politics should be added in the second semester of the third year; B.

Drawing: according to the current curriculum standards; K. Music: according to the current curriculum standards. (2) According to individual differences and with reference to the divisions of specialized education, prescribe the grouping methods as follows: A. Mathematics and Physics Group: Required courses include Trigonometry three hours, Advanced Algebra five hours, Analytical Geometry five hours, Mechanical Drawing two hours; B. Biology and Chemistry Group: Required courses include Advanced Algebra five hours, Biology four hours or Chemistry six hours, depending on whether Chemistry or Biology has been studied in the common required courses; C. Arts Group: Required courses may be determined with reference to the conditions of each school, with the following substitution methods: Chinese subjects twelve hours, or English subjects twelve hours, or History and Geography subjects twelve hours, or Music subjects twelve hours, or Art subjects twelve hours. (3) Prescribe vocational subjects to enable students to select the following subjects according to their group affiliation: A. Applied Electricity (repair, installation, and manufacturing of electric lights, electric stoves, electrical appliances, etc.); B. Wireless Engineering (repair, installation, and manufacturing of wireless broadcasting machines and radios, etc.); C. Telephone (repair, installation, and manufacturing of telephones, etc.); D.

It has now received an invitation from the Hong Kong Star Basketball Team and is currently brewing a response. Once it matures, it will be answered. As for whether Paramount will venture to the Philippines, there is no concrete plan yet, and it will be discussed slowly. Also, if Paramount decides to conquer Hong Kong, perhaps the strong football team, Lido, may travel with them, because the Hong Kong Eastern Association also intends to invite Lido. Lido is also considering it. As for the date of arrival in Hong Kong, according to the Hong Kong side, the best time is the end of April, because at that time, the Hong Kong Inter-Port Football Team will have returned to Hong Kong from the Philippines (the Hong Kong Inter-Port Team will conquer the Philippines at the end of this month), and the football season will be coming to an end. Before it ends, it is the most attractive. Paramount will have two or three games in Hong Kong, and Lido will have about three or four performances, for a total stay of about ten days. The Shanghai side is currently actively preparing, and the brewing result may become a reality, or it may not.

Li Zhaorong came back, and the Hong Kong League team knew that the situation was turbulent and waited in battle. Li Zhaorong bravely broke into the encirclement, and fired a shot, which hit the post, rebounded out, and Deng Guangsen rushed over and missed, losing a good opportunity.

He Li had been prepared for a long time, and greeted the refusal to go out of bounds, Deng Guangsen opened a corner kick, and also failed to take advantage of the fishing profit.

### Financial Northern Gang Comes Out of the Dragon's Den: Cash Prices Drop Sharply

Although the spot market situation yesterday was volatile, it was not as intense as the previous few days. However, prices followed the weak trend of the previous day, and it was heard that gold prices in Tianjin were also sluggish. Therefore, the Northern Gang and the Securities Gang, along with certain brokers, tended to come out of the dragon's den. Furthermore, some scattered bullish investors were also vying to close their positions, causing prices to plummet and close near the lowest price of the day. Only in the middle of the session did prices rise slightly due to mutual purchases by certain money changers and gold shops, but demand could not match supply and it was difficult to maintain. As a result, prices fell sharply by another 26 yuan. Sentiment on all sides was weak, and trading was still active. Gold jewelry also fell by 2 yuan. Official orders and Sino-British pure gold also declined slightly.

Spot Gold Falls Again by 26 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial selling price was called 2,158-9 yuan, but buyers were all waiting and watching. Before long, the Securities Gang and certain brokers also came to compete to dump, so the price broke into the 50 yuan mark. First, the Securities Gang sold 90 taels to the money changers at a price of 2,145 yuan, which was the opening price, 17 yuan lower than the previous close. After the opening, the Northern Gang's selling intention was even stronger, causing the price to continue to decline. A certain broker sold 90 taels to the gold shop gang at a price of 40 yuan. Following this, the Securities Gang also sold 50 taels to the money changers at the same price. After this, although the Securities Gang continued to dump, because a certain money changer and gold shop gang bought more and more, the price stopped falling and turned upward. A certain money changer entered 50 taels of the Securities Gang at 41 yuan, and then entered 50 taels of the Securities Gang at 43 yuan. After a certain money changer absorbed it, they soon sold 50 taels to the gold shop gang. Later, the gold shop gang entered 50 taels of a certain broker at 42 yuan. A gold shop entered 50 taels of a certain money changer at 47 yuan. After a certain money changer supplied, they immediately resold 50 taels to the same industry at 48 yuan. At the same price, the gold shop gang also entered 50 taels of a certain broker. At that time, sellers were even more short, and the gold shop gang entered 50 taels of money changers, jumping to 52 yuan. After this, because the Northern Gang's selling intention turned strong, it fell again. A certain broker sold 50 taels to the gold shop gang at 49.5 yuan. Following this, the Securities Gang sold 50 taels to the gold shop gang at 49 yuan. It was already noon at this time. In the afternoon, because the Northern Gang continued to dump heavily, and the general timid scattered bullish investors also came to close their positions, coupled with the extreme shortage of buyers, the price broke into the 40 yuan mark at the beginning. At 2:40 p.m., the money changers first sold 50 taels to their peers at a price of 37 yuan. Following this, the Northern Gang also sold 50 taels to their peers at the same price. Later, the Northern Gang sold another 100 taels to the gold shop at 35 yuan, which was the lowest price. Finally, the money changers traded 50 taels with each other at 2,136 yuan, which was the closing price, a drop of 26 yuan compared to the previous close (it has fallen for two consecutive days, totaling 54 yuan).

### Foreign Exchange Turns Stable: Hong Kong Exchange Rate Slightly Loosens

Although oil companies, Texaco, and other major foreign companies came to settle their accounts in the foreign exchange market yesterday, the process was quite stable because foreign telegrams also came from Hong Kong to dump. However, foreign banks such as HSBC generally bought low and sold high. As a result, there was no change in both British and American exchange rates, and trading was not active. Because foreign telegrams and Chinese banks frequently dumped Hong Kong exchange, and foreign companies were not strong in buying, the situation was slightly loose.

After this, although major foreign companies had some settlement, but because the foreign banks absorbed Hong Kong electricity, the intention to supply was still strong, so there was little change. The foreign company settled into HSBC British gold eight pence one two five, then Texaco also settled into a certain bank US exchange rate fifteen yuan eight seven five, near noon foreign banks, Huayi, etc. successively sold Hong Kong exchange, causing the potential to be slightly loose, Ji Yihua bank sold to the foreign bank Hong Kong exchange fifty-four yuan three seven five and half a yuan, noon close bank mutual trading price, British gold eight pence one four 〇 six two five, US exchange rate fifteen yuan nine 〇 six two five.

### Yarn and Cotton: Spring Sales Launched, Fine Yarn Jumps by Eight Yuan; Only 20s Yarn Remains Dull Due to Crowded Inventory

The yarn market still cannot escape the wandering phenomenon, because actual demand is flat, which makes people feel calm. However, the situation of 32s and 42s fine yarn is becoming increasingly tight, actually due to the development of spring sales, the Jiangxi gang is eager to search, coupled with the lack of spot chips on the market, and the factory's production spindles are very few, so business rises slightly, and the market price recovers. As for 20s yarn, because the inventory is thicker, and the factory's output has increased, while the southern demand is not as prosperous as before, the market is loose, so the 20s Double Horse yarn price has been in and out of the 400 yuan mark many times for a long time, but the public psychology is that the arrival of raw materials is weak, the price is rising daily, and the factory's cost is increased, it is expected that the factory will not be willing to sell cheaply, so although the transaction is sluggish, the holders maintain their positions, and the market situation is awkward, neither can it fall nor can it rise. But the momentum of 32s and 42s fine yarn is becoming increasingly tight, actual transactions are rising according to the season, and the demand is increasing relatively, but the production is more powerful, so the rising wind is actively advancing, and the price is six to eight yuan higher than the previous day. In the afternoon, 20s yarn was brought up a step by it, it is said that the Jiangxi · Ningbo · Hufu three gangs bought nearly 100 bales, and the same industry made about 200 bales.

The current yarn situation, the morning opening, is still a scattered atmosphere, because the procurement of all parties is very few, but the Jiangxi gang is still inquiring about fine yarn, and the general holders are unwilling to unload due to the improved environment, and the market price is especially strong, 32s Double Earth yarn started to make 506 yuan, and soon jumped four yuan, to 510 yuan, but the 20s Double Horse yarn price still opened at 400 yuan, not much different from the previous day. After that, there was still not much change, and after the afternoon opening, the fine yarn market price rose step by step, and the 20s yarn was also brought up, rising five jiao, and the 20s Double Horse yarn price was 400 yuan, 0.05 jiao. As a result, 1,390 bales were traded, and the same industry still accounted for the majority, the trend of 20s Double Horse rose five jiao, and Te Jin Cheng rose one yuan, the rest were stable, only fine yarn jumped six to eight yuan, the factory did not move, today cotton yarn has one hundred and sixty-five pieces shipped to Tianjin, two hundred and fifty-five pieces shipped to Shantou, and the amount bought by each gang is recorded on the left.

The selling price of Japanese yarn is still dull, because the northern sales route is stagnant again, so the market situation is even more frustrated, the current yarn price of 20s Water Moon is 335 yuan, and the current yarn price of 20s Blue Phoenix is 329 yuan, not much different from the previous day.

### Local Cotton Sales Are Gradually Flourishing

The local cotton business is developing more and more. Shenxin Factory's purchase of American and Indian cotton is especially huge, and it has also begun to purchase and apply local cotton. Therefore, the market price continues to advance, the general holders, given the lack of source and the daily depletion of inventory, the idea of hoarding is even more important, the market price has stepped up as a result. The same industry's trading is mostly occupied by Tianjin fine velvet, fire engine flower still makes 70 yuan, spot price, and now Qiong cotton industry people say that the goods in various producing areas are still congested and unable to ship, and the goods are rotten on the ground. If you try to reach Shanghai, the profit is thick and unspeakable, so traffickers have not been cut off, but the amount is fine, but the interest is quite thick, the wharf arrives with 119 bales of Xiasha flower, and 10,000 bales of Yao flower, but according to another report, Yao flower is shipped from Ningbo only 3,470 pieces. The situation of current cotton is recorded on the left.

### British Cloth Widely Promoted, Driving US Cotton Sales; Rumor of US Loan Cotton Release of 500,000 Bales; Also Rumor of Shen Xin Importing 6,000 Bales of Indian Cotton

Foreign cotton market prices, New York and Lancashire cloth sales are increasingly widespread, the cotton available for sale on the market is becoming increasingly scarce, and the remaining cotton is all of the lowest grade. The issue of the US government's loan cotton sales has not yet been resolved. The need for raw cotton is increasing daily. Before the new cotton arrives on the market, a large amount of loan cotton needs to be released to facilitate circulation and meet the needs. Although representatives from Lancashire have been dispatched to negotiate with US Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace to release some loan cotton first, US congressmen have also suggested to the government that Smith's proposal be slightly revised to find a way to release 500,000 bales of loan cotton ahead of schedule. The New York cotton market is showing exceptional strength, rising another seven or eight pounds yesterday. In India, due to Gandhi's hunger strike, the exchange has suspended trading, but a major cotton firm received a telegram predicting that the price of Broach cotton in April and May will be 156 rupees, more than four rupees higher than the exchange price last week. Egyptian cotton rose by more than ten pounds. Yesterday's exchange rate was looser. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices increased by four jiao per dan for US cotton and Brazilian cotton, two jiao for Indian cotton, and more than seven jiao for Egyptian cotton.

Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai are unusually quiet because the soaring overseas cotton market, when converted to legal tender, is not cost-effective. However, it is rumored on the market that Shen Xin has purchased another 6,000 bales of Indian cotton, but this has not been confirmed. With the price of Indian cotton soaring, Shen Xin is unlikely to order foreign cotton. Moreover, the factory has a large inventory, so it will not purchase at a high price. Xin Yu has a strong intention to purchase, but due to the large price difference, although a telegram has been sent to Mumbai, it is feared that a deal will be difficult to reach. Japanese factories have traded 3,000 bales of Indian cotton, including 1,500 bales for the Shanghai factory, 500 bales for Yu Feng, and 500 bales each for Da Kang and Toyota. The factory prices of cotton yesterday, converted to legal tender, are listed below:

### Last Week's Cotton Yarn: Over 15,000 Bales Traded; Coarse Yarn Accounts for 80%; Trade in Eastern Zhejiang Still Feels Sluggish

From February 27th to March 5th, the yarn market for the past week has shown a lively atmosphere due to the start of spring sales. Hua Nan, Yunnan gangs, Hua Bei, and Tianjin gangs have successively launched purchases, which has boosted morale and revitalized the market. However, an examination of the goods purchased shows that 10-count coarse yarn accounts for over 80%, while the demand for fine yarn remains flat, so the selling price of coarse yarn has suddenly become tight. At the same time, factories are opening frequently to meet the needs of all parties. As a result, the price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn has increased by four and a half yuan compared to the previous week.

Factories are opening 610 bales of 10-count coarse yarn and 150 bales of 20-count fine yarn. In Eastern Zhejiang, the shipping of cloth is gradually increasing, but cotton yarn transactions are still sluggish. In southern Fujian, Japanese warships are gathering, and merchants are worried, so yarn sales declined again on the weekend. The prospects will be difficult to improve without the development of several batches of transactions, and currently remain in a state of fluctuation.

Yunnan Gang: 3,080 bales

Tianjin Gang: 2,755 bales

Trading Houses: 7,185 bales

Others: 2,235 bales

Total Weekly Transactions: 15,235 bales

### Securities: Rising; Foreign Debt Quiet

The securities gray market yesterday continued to strengthen due to the vigorous buying by general bulls. It is generally believed that a new loan is about to be established, which has boosted morale. In reality, the UK is providing economic assistance to China while using it to suppress Japan, making it easier for Japan to comply. However, British diplomacy is known for its mystery, and there is probably no such simple and straightforward action. The internal situation is still unpredictable. Although the loan of 3 million pounds is limited, it is still beneficial. Observation from a rights perspective shows that so-called large investors are still selling at high prices, but there are many sellers and they are widely dispersed. At this time, the rights are narrow, and it is feared that it will be difficult to maintain for long. The market opened in the morning with strong buying of No. 35. Nos. 10, 15, and 7 all saw selling. The market price rose from low to high, and retail investors also bought more than they sold. In the forenoon, it was slightly firmer by one or two jiao. In the afternoon, Tiansheng, Lianhe, Gongmao, and No. 20 all had considerable interest, and No. 7 also continued to show interest. Nos. 10 and Xie Da sold. The market was still more in demand than supply, and the market price gradually and suddenly strengthened, rising another three or four jiao. At this time, the bulls had become unified, but without large investors, the prospects may still change. As a result, the market price continued to rise uniformly by four or five jiao, with a total transaction volume of approximately 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock Transactions: Yesterday, 150 shares of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were traded at a price of 26.5 yuan, it is said.

London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds, quoted on Monday, the 6th of this month, Anglo-German Continued Loans, Anglo-French bonds jumped by one and a half pounds, priced at 75 pounds; Longhai Railway bonds rose by one pound, priced at 14.5 pounds; Sino-French US 5% bonds, printed bonds and Fix aircraft loan bonds each rose by half a pound, the former priced at 66.5 pounds and the latter priced at 14.5 pounds, the rest remained unchanged. London supply and demand also remained quiet.

London British Far East Companies Stocks, quoted on Monday, the 6th of this month, only Kaiping Coal Mines bearer shares rose by three pence, priced at 17 shillings and six pence, the rest remained unchanged.

### Lee Wai Motors Dividend: 50% Weekly Interest

Consolidated Rubber Shares Also Pay Dividends. The British Consolidated Rubber Estates Limited, managed by Xiang Mao Yanghang in this port, announced yesterday that the profits for 1938 were 49,327.90 yuan in national currency, which, added to the carry-over from the previous year, totaled 63,190.18 yuan in national currency. The company's board of directors has now decided to transfer 25,000 yuan in national currency from the reserve fund, bringing the total dividend distribution account to 88,190.18 yuan in national currency. After paying a dividend of 0.12 yuan per share, totaling 58,180.44 yuan in national currency, and allocating 16,225.03 yuan in national currency for depreciation reserves, the remaining 13,784.71 yuan in national currency will be carried over to the next year. It is reported that this distribution plan must be approved by the shareholders' meeting on the 22nd of this month before it can be paid out.

The board of directors of Lee Wai Motors Limited in this port resolved yesterday to pay the final dividend for 1938, which is 2 yuan in national currency per share. Including the two interim dividends paid last year, the total dividend paid is 4 yuan in national currency per share (face value of 8 yuan in national currency per share).

### Piece Goods: Demand for Fine Yarn Fabrics Increasing; Pricing of Poplin from Various Factories Gradually Increasing

National cloth uses fine yarn thread as raw material, and there is a lack of spot goods. Due to the seasonal shift, the demand for fine yarn thread fabrics from both domestic and foreign locations has expanded, so sales are smooth and supply cannot meet demand. The pricing of plain and fancy poplin from various factories is gradually increasing, and the current market price is continuing to rise by about 0.3 yuan per piece compared to the end of last month. The asking price is particularly high. The selling prices of foreign yarn, hemp yarn, and bleached cloth have also increased uniformly. The Sichuan gang's demand is continuous, and they are continuing to purchase over 2,000 pieces of bleached cloth, hemp yarn, plain and fancy poplin, printed cloth, printed twill, and dyed cloth. The Guangdong gang is purchasing over 200 pieces of poplin, dyed cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. The Wen Yong gang is purchasing 100+ cases of bleached cloth, bleached twill, poplin, foreign yarn, and dyed cloth, 70-80 bales of white goods, fine cloth, twill, and group cloth. The selling price is flat. Bleaching and dyeing factories on this street have a considerable demand for fine yarn thread gray cloth. Due to the cold and cloudy weather, retail business remains quiet. The military situation in northern Jiangsu is tense, and a large number of transactions in that area have been temporarily suspended. Wholesale transactions in the interior are also rare.

The market for white goods in Dongpi is turning firmer because the Tianjin gang dumped goods the day before yesterday and then searched for more yesterday. Yanging customers also absorbed some. The wholesale demand for fine cloth and fine twill from various brands such as Beilu Gongjin on this street is sluggish, but the actual sales to dyeing factories are gradually increasing, so the turnover of fine cloth reached over 800 pieces yesterday and fine twill reached approximately 200 pieces. The selling price rebounded by 0.09-0.15 yuan per piece.

Today, 800 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin, 200 pieces to Yantai, 64 pieces to Weihaiwei, 315 pieces to Shantou, and 40 pieces to Hong Kong. Yesterday, 575 pieces of cotton textiles arrived from Tianjin.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese Authorities Cracking Down on Speculation; Yokohama Silk Futures and Spot Prices Plunge; Silk Prices in This City Also Fall Secretly by 30 Yuan

Yesterday's silk market in Yokohama suddenly turned sharply lower. The spot price opened in the morning at 1,020 yuan, and in the afternoon at 1,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 55 yuan compared to the previous day. The forward price was 978 yuan, and in the afternoon 959 yuan, a sharp drop of 40 yuan compared to the previous day. It is believed that this is due to the Japanese authorities cracking down on speculation. New York and Lyon fluctuated slightly yesterday, and will inevitably fall today. This publication has repeatedly pointed out the risks of this silk market rally. Although the objective and subjective environment of the silk industry is conducive to hoarding and speculation, speculators or industrialists cannot avoid the cycle of "capital-commodity-". Therefore, a price increase can stimulate actual sales, but it must not deviate from actual sales. Otherwise, even if the regulatory authorities do not crack down on speculation, after market order is disrupted and commodities are released, an unexpected price drop will inevitably follow the crazy price increase.

Yesterday, the silk market in this port also weakened accordingly. Bai Changjing's prices inside and outside were not opening, and silk prices had secretly fallen by 30 yuan. There were also no transactions in Indian shops. It is believed that the silk market in this port will also move downstream from observation.

### Oil Cakes: Soybeans under Japanese Control

The soybean market can be discussed in two ways. First, Dalian quick soybeans were still firm in the morning due to the bullish outlook in Dalian City. Afterwards, the bulls took advantage of the Dalian price increase to release goods, which weakened the market. As a result, Dalian soybeans for April delivery fell by 0.2 yuan, with about 10 cars changing hands, and 3 cars for May delivery at a price of 8.5 yuan. Other sand yellow Du soybeans are in short supply due to seasonal reasons, so morale is still solid and the market continues to rise. It is estimated that over 150 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans changed hands at prices ranging from 8.4 to 8.3 yuan, 20 bags of Pudong Du soybeans at a price of 10 yuan, and 70 bags of Pinghu Du soybeans at a price of 13.02 yuan.

526 bags of soybeans arrived in Tianjin on the 7th, and 1,480 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong and 500 bags to Yantai on the 8th.

The peanut oil market had rumors that Qingdao had a lenient solution, so well-informed people took the lead and immediately sold 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil at a price of 26 yuan, a decrease of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day's market. Afterwards, those who floated and hoarded quickly sold 150 pieces for profit at a price of 25.5 yuan, a further decrease of 0.5 yuan. However, bonded warehouse oil opened in the morning, so the market was unusually stagnant, but the situation was also dangerous. Yantai canned oil initially opened at 34 yuan, then fell to 33.5 yuan. As a result, it also fell by 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day's market. Yesterday, 500 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.

The soybean oil market, under organized manipulation, began to decline. The market was once chaotic, and prices fell frequently. The market was slightly clearer at the close, and a total of 0.4-0.5 yuan was shaved. A total of 250 barrels of current Dalian oil, 75 barrels of March upper, 800-900 barrels of March lower, 100+ barrels of April upper, and 50 barrels of April were sold.

### Food: Rice Prices Rise Further

Yesterday's supply from various gangs was still only No. 3 from Hexia. There were no carloads of buns due to the train stoppage. As a result, morale was even higher and the price increases became more intense. Warehouse goods were taken advantage of for release, and hoarders absorbed a considerable amount. All goods already show a chaotic image. The general market and high-priced goods are opening at 14 yuan, and mid-range goods are also already above 13 yuan. The situation is the same for Yangjian. Doushanjian rose by 0.3-0.4 yuan, and Bianyuan rose again by more than 0.5 yuan. In short, this phenomenon has a significant impact on the future of food for the people.

### Today's Women's World: Commemorating the March 8th Women's Day; Expressing Respect to Madame Chiang Kai-shek; The Municipal Party Headquarters Exhorts with Three Matters

Today is "March 8th" Women's Day. The women's community in this city deeply recognizes that women's liberation and national liberation are inseparable. At this time of the sacred War of Resistance, which continues to advance, the final victory is not far off, and it expresses boundless enthusiasm and excitement. Although the women's community will not hold a grand celebration today, women's groups and women's primary and secondary schools will hold commemorative ceremonies and luncheons to encourage each other to fulfill the responsibilities that women should fulfill in this extraordinary period. The various women's groups have expressed their deep respect for Madame Chiang Kai-shek Mei-ling Soong, who leads the national women's community in participating in the War of Resistance and disaster relief. The Shanghai Women's Relief Association for Refugees, considering that the refugees are victims of the country and suffering in their lives, has specially designated representatives to visit various shelters from today onwards to express condolences.

The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters issued a letter to all women compatriots in the city on the occasion of March 8th, saying: The great March 8th Women's Day has arrived again in the phase of the War of Resistance entering the later stage and the national revolutionary movement becoming more favorable. Recalling the glorious historical traces of our country's War of Resistance in the past, looking forward to the arduous tasks at hand, and the tragic devastation suffered by women in the war zone, displaced and suffering, how will the women compatriots in Shanghai be excited, angry, and vigilant, stepping on the blood of the martyrs, seeking the true liberation of the nation, and striving for the permanent survival of the country? The strong War of Resistance in the past 20 months has already laid the foundation for the final victory. The women compatriots across the country have also generally awakened in this high tide of the War of Resistance. Whether in the occupied areas, in the rear, or on the battlefield, there are vast women's masses who dedicate themselves to the country, doing comfort, rescue, and military-civilian cooperation work on the front line, and doing public propaganda, organization, training, comforting soldiers' families, and participating in production work in the rear. Even the women compatriots trapped on the isolated island are not willing to lag behind and have fulfilled considerable responsibilities such as donating funds and rescuing the distressed. Now that the War of Resistance and national construction have entered a new period, and the final victory is getting closer and closer, the work is also entering a more arduous and critical stage. What the country expects from our national people is even more eager. Only by further concentrating the national human, material, and financial resources can we seize the favorable conditions for overcoming the enemy and completing the final mission of the national revolution. Only in this way can Sun Yat-sen's new China be realized sooner. Here, the women compatriots in Shanghai really need to work harder and strengthen their struggle.

First, planning the national spiritual mobilization. Our country's War of Resistance is materially inferior to the enemy, but spiritually, the enemy is far inferior to us. From now on, the material differences between the enemy and us will become closer due to the enemy's financial and economic difficulties and our continuous innovation. The difference between the enemy and us in spirit will increase due to the high tide of the anti-war sentiments of the enemy's military and civilians and the more determined will of our War of Resistance. This spiritual advantage is a strong guarantee for us to achieve the final victory. Our highest leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, has personally formulated the outline and implementation methods of the national spiritual mobilization in order to fully encourage this favorable condition, hoping that under the unified and powerful belief that our national people will win the War of Resistance and succeed in national construction, we can concentrate human, material, and financial resources to crush the enemy's conspiracy to paralyze and corrupt the spirit of our nation, and defeat the stubborn enemy forces that have fallen into difficulties, and complete the great task of War of Resistance and national construction. The influence that our women compatriots can appeal to people in the family and in society is really pivotal. It is hoped that the women compatriots in Shanghai will strive to rectify themselves, from themselves to their families to society, and strive to eliminate all hesitant and wavering thoughts, establish a correct revolutionary will, make traitors and puppets repent, at least not be able to gain a foothold in the family and society, rectify the source, and women compatriots bear a major mission.

Second, thoroughly implement the work of boycotting enemy goods. Since the "July 7th" Incident launched the war of aggression, the enemy has spent tens of billions of war expenses, and what they have gained, in addition to occupying some points and lines, is only the unprecedented deterioration of international relations, and the aggressor military has fallen into the predicament of being unable to defend themselves. Especially in terms of finance and economy, there is a danger of total collapse. The final struggle is to plunder resources and collect wealth within our country, and implement large-scale dumping. The so-called economic promotion and economic cooperation are only aimed at taking Japan as the mainstay to complete its monopoly and monopolize our country's economic lifeline. If our national people can recognize where the enemy's conspiracy lies and completely eliminate enemy goods, the enemy's economy and finances will accelerate their bankruptcy. Therefore, our women compatriots must deeply understand the advantages and disadvantages, and absolutely refuse to purchase and use enemy goods. If they can do it thoroughly, the benefit to the future of the War of Resistance will not be less than that of the soldiers who kill the enemy on the front line.

Third, expand the savings and donation movement. The savings and donation movement has achieved considerable results in Shanghai in the past, but if we examine it carefully, first, the work is not universal and in-depth enough, especially it cannot reach the affluent and superior classes. Second, it has not been able to truly achieve donations from savings, still similar to ordinary donations. Now that the War of Resistance and national construction have reached a critical juncture, we can only rely on the national people to be thrifty and tighten their belts to increase production capital and actively donate funds to improve the national strength of the War of Resistance in order to guarantee the final victory. The citizens of Shanghai are immersed in an atmosphere of extravagance and decadence, and those who have accumulated bad habits are still visible everywhere. I sincerely hope that the women compatriots in Shanghai will supervise each other and create a center of social frugality. Especially if the women compatriots in Shanghai can take the lead in self-encouragement, the savings movement will achieve more than half of the results. Furthermore, donating the savings to the government will be of great benefit to the country. Recently, women's donations in Chongqing reached 700,000 yuan. If the women compatriots in Shanghai can enthusiastically contribute, it must be more than this number, and it is necessary to promote it universally and practically. The above three matters are only a few of the most important ones. Our women compatriots should make greater contributions and make more courageous struggles to the War of Resistance and national construction based on the past revolutionary spirit. We must know that when the final victory of our country's War of Resistance is achieved, it will also be the day when our national women compatriots are thoroughly liberated. Finally, I respectfully wish all women compatriots in the city a successful effort.

### Unstamped Shops: Chamber of Commerce Informs to Rectify

After the Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified all industries of the new regulations for stamping, all shops and firms in this port have followed them after resuming business for the year. Recently, the Chamber of Commerce learned that a very small number of shops have not implemented the regulations. In order to effectively rectify this, the Chamber of Commerce has separately informed each of these shops to comply with the regulations.

### Japanese Military Action Begins in Northern Jiangsu; Requires Third-Country Nationals to Mark Property with National Flags on a Flat Surface; Japanese Warships Bombard the Sheyang River Estuary Yesterday

The Continental News reported that the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy announced last night (6th) that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, notified the Shanghai Consular Corps yesterday that the Japanese army is currently launching military operations in northern Jiangsu. The Consular Corps should notify the third-country nationals residing in the area in advance. The note from Miura stated that the Japanese army will "specially" conduct military operations in the Huaiyang and Xuhai areas. The Huaiyang area is the area near Huaiyin and Siyang, while the Xuhai area extends from Xuzhou to Haizhou. The note also requested that the property and houses belonging to third-country nationals in the area be marked with their national flags, but they must be marked on a flat surface and be sufficiently large and clear to avoid accidental bombing. According to the New News Agency, according to shipping industry sources, a Japanese warship suddenly fired more than a dozen shells at the shore at the Sheyang River estuary in Funing, northern Jiangsu, at about 8:00 a.m. yesterday. At the same time, three Japanese aircraft appeared in the sky. The military authorities in the area had already taken strict precautions, and the Sheyang River estuary has also been blockaded. This move by the Japanese side seems to be exploring the strength of the defending troops. Chinese troops have gathered in the Funing area to prepare for resistance.

### Portuguese Consul in Hankou Assaults Japanese Sentry; Japanese Side Lodges Protest

The Continental News reported that according to yesterday's (6th) Japanese Continental News, an unfortunate incident occurred at the border between the French Concession and Special District 2 in Hankou on Saturday night. Once the investigation is completed, the Japanese authorities will lodge a strong protest with the Portuguese authorities in China against the behavior of the Portuguese Consul in Hankou, Belchinko. The newspaper further stated that according to information obtained by this port yesterday, Belchinko forcibly opened the gate between the French Concession and Special District 2, which had been closed at 10:00 p.m., at 11:07 p.m. on Saturday night, and beat one of the Japanese sentries with a cane. Belchinko himself injured his hand on the barbed wire. Because Belchinko was an official, the sentry allowed him to return to his residence, but he was summoned to the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters for questioning on Sunday.

### National Regular Army Has Entered the Jinghu Line, Shangguan Yunxiang Appointed Commander, Japanese Army Panicked, Deploying Fortifications, Changshu Puppet Police Entirely Subdued

The central government has prepared for the guerrillas in the Jinpu Railway area, and three elite regular divisions have been transferred from a certain location at the beginning of this month, under the command of Shangguan Yunxiang. A large-scale general counter-offensive will soon occur. The Japanese army is extremely panicked and has been deploying defensive fortifications on the Jinpu Railway line for days. The details are as follows, as reported by a reporter from the Modern News Agency:

Regular Army Deployed to Jinpu Line

The central government has made overall plans for the military operations in various guerrilla areas and has established a Guerrilla Headquarters. Chairman Jiang concurrently serves as the Director-General and has designated various provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Shandong, etc., to be divided into several districts. A sub-bureau will be established in each district. The senior military and political officials have already been appointed, and each district is actively proceeding. It is learned that regarding the Jinpu Railway line, the central government has dispatched three elite regular divisions, totaling over 40,000 men, which arrived at various locations along the Jinpu Railway at the beginning of this month according to the planned schedule. All original guerrilla units scattered in various districts that were engaged in attacking the Japanese army have been reorganized by the regular army as reserve teams, staying behind to guard the local area and not disturbing the people. All supplies are issued by the central government.

Japanese Army Panicked, Deploying Fortifications After the war zone was expanded, most of the Japanese army in the rear has been transferred to the front line for combat. The number of Japanese soldiers guarding the Jinpu Railway line is only about one division, and many of these soldiers are new recruits enlisted domestically and sent to China. Their strength is quite weak. In recent days, the Japanese side has been deploying fortifications along the Jinpu Railway line day and night. Because the anti-war sentiment among the Japanese troops in various places has been strong recently, and the puppet troops that have been incorporated have also defected from time to time, the Japanese military authorities are uneasy and the situation is extremely tense and panicked.

Large-Scale Guerrilla Warfare Launched The central government has appointed Shangguan Yunxiang to command the guerrilla warfare on the Jinpu Railway line. It is learned that he has arrived at a certain location and, together with the head of the Jiangsu Guerrilla Sub-bureau, is inspecting the Jinpu Railway line and carrying out preparations for the general counter-offensive. It is expected that large-scale guerrilla warfare will be launched on the Jinpu Railway line in the shortest possible time. As for the puppet troops, police, and security teams in various counties that have surrendered to the Japanese and been incorporated, the central government has given them nominal status and will take the opportunity to respond during the general counter-offensive.

Cao Changjin's Troops Enter Changshu On the evening of the 6th, Guerrilla Captain Cao Changjin led his troops from Tangshizhen and stormed into the west gate of Changshu, surrounding the puppet Jiangzhe Fourth District Pacification Headquarters and forcing them to surrender their weapons. The puppet commander Xu Fengzao fled in panic, and the remaining troops abandoned their weapons and surrendered. Cao's troops captured 260 rifles, 57 Mauser pistols, and 12 light and heavy machine guns without bloodshed, and subdued 280 puppet police officers. After sounding the horns and reorganizing the team, they withdrew from the city and returned to the outskirts to await opportunities for attack.

Japanese Army in Zhabei Adds Bunkers The Japanese army in Shanghai, fearing attacks by Chinese guerrillas, has increased its troops and set up defensive fortifications in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, Hongkou, and West Shanghai. They have also sealed off empty houses in Nanshi and Zhabei to prevent guerrillas from hiding. Yesterday, the Japanese and puppet forces carried out work to seal off empty houses in Pudong and West Shanghai. At the same time, they added bunkers and stationed troops for defense in various districts such as Baziqiao, Miaohang, and Zhongshan Road Bridge. On the one hand, the Japanese army patrolled in groups of three or five, and the level of fear was unprecedented.

Japanese Army in West Shanghai According to villagers traveling to and from the guerrilla area, recently, large groups of Japanese troops have suddenly gone to garrison in Beixinjing, Hongqiao, Hejiajiao, and other places. They are conducting stricter inspections of people entering and leaving, and in addition to dispatching sentries at various water and land transportation points, they have also added defensive materials. In the Chenjiazhai area west of the Daxilu Railway, Japanese troops have dug trenches. Around 9:00 a.m. the previous morning, those coming to Shanghai from West Shanghai heard rumbling cannon fire and dense machine gun fire. Judging from the situation, it seemed to be live ammunition exercises by the Japanese army. However, given the tense atmosphere of navigation in West Shanghai recently, it may be to prevent guerrilla attacks and therefore a show of force for deterrence.

### Guerrilla Area Establishes Administrative Committee, Baoshan and Other Counties Begin Implementation, Requesting the Provincial Government to Appoint Supervisory Officials

More than a year has passed since the nine counties of Songjiang Prefecture in southern Jiangsu fell into enemy hands. However, a large part of the land is still under the control of our guerrillas. However, local administration cannot be without personnel for a single day, and some county magistrates appointed by the provincial government have not yet taken office. The guerrillas are also not in a position to overstep their authority and interfere, so there is a lack of leading officials and local politics cannot be promoted. The local gentry and influential figures in each county, based on their patriotic and pro-homeland enthusiasm, have jointly organized the Jiangsu Province Songjiang Prefecture Nine Counties Administrative Committee, inviting local figures of high reputation from each county to serve as members. On the one hand, they have submitted a report to the provincial government and the War Zone Headquarters for record, and on the other hand, they have established county administrative committees in each of these counties, acting on behalf of the county magistrate before he takes office, assisting the government, and promoting local administration, so as to integrate with the people's armed forces. It is now heard that Baoshan and other counties have begun implementation, and representatives will be sent to the provincial government to request the appointment of supervisory officials. Once approved by the superiors, it can be formally established.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Quanzhou, Destroying Foreign Merchant Warehouses, Two Foreign Ships Searched on the Same Day, Japanese艇 Also Seized and Burned Sailing Ships

The Continental News reports that on Friday of last week, a Japanese seaplane flew twice over the vicinity of Quanzhou, fifty miles north of Xiamen, destroying a warehouse belonging to a foreign merchant. According to news received in this port yesterday (the 6th), a warehouse belonging to Jardine Matheson, whose head office is in Hong Kong, was severely damaged in Quanzhou during the air raid. However, whether there were casualties is not yet known. On the same day, two foreign ships were boarded and inspected by sailors from a Japanese cruiser, delaying their voyage due to the verification of documents. According to what was learned last night, one of the ships was the Taikoo Company's Anqing, which is currently sailing on the Xiamen-Manila line. It is heard that the other ship belongs to Douglas Company. The Taikoo Company's office in this port had not yet received any information last night about the Anqing being searched, because after the ship stopped sailing to Shanghai, it was impossible to receive its report immediately. According to another report, when the vicinity of Quanzhou was raided on Friday, two Japanese armed motorboats were seen entering the inner harbor, seizing two Fuzhou sailing ships and setting them on fire.

### Director of Banque de l'Indochine, Mr. Schiffer, Returns to France, Vacancy to Be Filled by Mr. Courteaud as Acting Director

According to the Shanghai French Daily of the 7th, it is heard that Mr. Schiffer, the director of Banque de l'Indochine in this port, will return to France for vacation tomorrow via Siberia. It is also heard that after Mr. Schiffer returns to his country, his vacancy as director will be filled by Mr. Courteaud as acting director.

### National Financial Conference Opens in Chongqing, Banking Sector Cables Opinions, and Cables Congratulations to the Conference

The second National Financial Conference held by the Ministry of Finance opened in Chongqing the day before yesterday (the 6th). Approximately 40 representatives from local banks in various provinces participated to discuss wartime financial stabilization measures. According to news from the banking sector in this city, regarding the banks in this city, the responsible persons of each bank in Hong Kong were responsible for representing and attending the conference in Chongqing, and the authorities of each bank stationed in Shanghai did not have representatives to participate. However, regarding various measures to stabilize finance and develop the economy in the future, plans have been cabled to Chongqing for contribution, so that they can be adopted. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the conference, congratulating them on a successful outcome.

### Soybean and Rice Market Strictly Enforces Price Limits, Announces to All Guilds to Maintain the People's Food Supply and Continue Trading, Rice Industry Groups Announce the Reasons for Soaring Rice Prices, Guild Sends Letter to Concession Authorities to Order Foreign Rice

The Soybean and Rice Industry Association of this city recently decided through a joint meeting of all executives and supervisors to maintain the price limit of 14 yuan due to the soaring rice prices in Shanghai, which affects the people's food supply. An announcement was issued to all guilds and merchants to comply. After the rice market opened yesterday morning, the trading situation tended to ease, but the market price still rose. The details are as follows:

Sub-Association Announces to All Guilds and Merchants

The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association issued an announcement to all guilds and merchants in the rice market yesterday, stating: "Recently, rice prices have been rising and have reached the original price limit. However, there are still 600,000 to 700,000 bags of rice in Shanghai, and the supply has not been interrupted. It should not be scarce for a while. For the sake of the people's food supply in this city, the original price limit should still be maintained. The highest price of white rice should not exceed 14 yuan per picul. This has been decided by our association. It is hoped that all guilds and merchants will consider the overall situation and comply accordingly, and do not exceed the price limit, so as to maintain the people's food supply. This is what we earnestly hope. This announcement is hereby made on March 7, 28th year of the Republic of China."

Transactions by Merchants Still Rose Yesterday

After the Soybean and Rice Industry Association decided at a joint meeting of all executives and supervisors on the 6th of this month that the rice price in this city should still maintain the original price limit of 14 yuan per picul and should not exceed it, a notice was posted to inform all guilds and merchants to comply. After the rice market opened at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, although囤户 (tun hu - households hoarding goods) and merchants had some goods arriving and being sold, the quantity was limited, while the sales volume increased significantly, so the market price still rose. The highest market price, excluding commissions, has reached the peak of the price limit, and there is a tendency to exceed it.

Market Strictly Enforces Price Limits

The Management Committee of the Rice Market at 550 Fuzhou Road in this city strictly enforces the price limit in accordance with the association's decision. In order to prevent colleagues and merchants from engaging in private off-market transactions outside the price limit, so that the market price is raised invisibly, all management committee members are uniformly present in the market for supervision to suppress it. If any similar off-market transaction is found to have occurred, it will be reported to the association for punishment.

Announcing Reasons for Soaring Rice Prices

According to a Modern News reporter's inquiry to the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, Rice Firm Association, and various merchants transporting rice regarding the reasons for the soaring rice prices in Shanghai, the various groups announced the following: (1) After the autumn harvest last year, in addition to supplying the people of Shanghai, the rice and grain along the river was being collected and transported for export by a certain party in the interior in large quantities. Rice and grain from various producing areas that were not affected by the war were also being stored by the central government and not allowed to be transported out. (2) The area of the producing areas along the river is limited. After this large amount of export, the reserves are limited, resulting in a high rise in prices in the interior. In addition, the "institutions" of the Japanese and puppet regimes impose heavy taxes, causing losses for the various merchants transporting rice. (3) Although the rice reserves in Shanghai are sufficient, most of them are in the hands of囤户 (tun hu - households hoarding goods). According to general observation, rice prices are bound to rise when the new crop is not yet available, and there is a rare opportunity to profit, so囤户 (tun hu - households hoarding goods) are unwilling to sell, waiting for a good price. Based on the above reasons, rice prices in Shanghai have risen suddenly. It is possible to suppress the market price for the time being, but it is difficult to predict whether there will be a panic regarding rice and grain in the future.

Sending Letter to Concession to Order Foreign Rice

The Soybean and Rice Industry Association of this city, in view of the large amount of rice and grain in the interior being directly exported, resulting in limited reserves in the producing areas, and fearing that a panic will occur in the Shanghai people's food supply when the new crop is not yet available, in order to take precautions, a letter has been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Concession Municipal Council, requesting them to make proper arrangements as soon as possible, and to present the current situation of rice markets in various places in detail to the authorities, and to suggest ordering foreign rice, so as to transport it to Shanghai to meet the future shortage of the people's food supply.

### Tragic Situation in Zhenjiang, Receiving Shanghai Newspaper Leads to Arrest, Tragic Events Difficult to Describe

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, according to people from Zhenjiang, the state of Zhenjiang can be summarized in two phrases: the atrocities of the Japanese sentries and the rapid deterioration of the general situation. Because mail is inspected, it is difficult for accurate information to be transmitted from the interior to the city. Those who control the people are also trying to control the people's minds. Intellectual slaves fear that slaves are not as good as them. Recently, some people who received mailed Shanghai

Chinese evening newspapers were arrested and charged with crimes, because the authorities wanted to make the people only know what they wanted the people to know. Because the way to freely communicate accurate information has been blocked, it is not surprising that rumors arise. The streets are quite desolate at night, and curfews are sometimes implemented before 9:00 p.m. There is hardly any light on the streets. The main streets in the city are

Muddy all over the place when it rains, making it almost impossible to pass. Some shops have built sheds and are operating, because the people returning to the city are trying to find ways to make a living. The countryside is not peaceful day and night, and robberies are heard from time to time. Tragic events occur repeatedly and cannot be described one by one. For example, a farmer tried to chase after his donkey that had escaped, and when he caught it, he accidentally passed in front of a sentry and was shot and killed instantly. A businessman bowed to a sentry and accidentally dropped his hat. When he tried to pick it up, he was actually

Stabbed by a civilian officer. Slaps and other atrocities are even more numerous. A woman was stripped of her lower clothes and tied to a telephone pole because she was taking branches on the side of the mountain, because others used the branches there as fuel. In fact, even a blade of grass, a piece of wood, a brick, and a stone seem to be useful to others.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Exemption from Taxes on 1 Million Dan of Foreign Rice, to Provide Relief for the People's Food Supply in Chaozhou and Shantou in South China, Cracking Down on Manipulation, Protecting Good Residence

The food supply in Chaozhou and Shantou in southern China has always relied on foreign rice and Shanghai rice to maintain. After the Jianghai Customs refused to allow the transshipment of rice and grain, rice merchants in Chaozhou and Shantou directly purchased goods from the producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and then loaded them onto foreign ships for transport to adjust the supply. However, due to the Japanese warships obstructing foreign ships from loading rice for transport to the south, Chaozhou, Shantou, and other gangs were unable to purchase goods from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, resulting in a rice shortage in the area, which was very serious. After various groups requested the government to allow tax-free imports of foreign rice, the Ministry of Finance reviewed and submitted it to the Executive Yuan, which has approved 1 million dan of foreign rice to be imported to Chaozhou and Shantou tax-free, allowing rice merchants to freely order from overseas. Regarding how to prevent manipulation, prevent speculation, and fundamentally suppress rice prices so that ordinary people can obtain real benefits, the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government has ordered Commissioner He and Mayor Wu to discuss methods with rice merchants.

### Factories on Yichang Road Request Postponement of Factory Site Relocation, to Avoid Displacement of More Than 1,000 Workers, Relocation Will Be Carried Out After the Difficult Times of the War Have Passed

Sun Da Sawmill, Yifeng Stone Powder Factory, Qinhe Copper and Iron Foundry, Shen Chengyuan Shipping Factory, Dongfang Shipping Factory, Sanhexing Shipping Factory, Tailai Machinery Shipbuilding Factory, Xin Sheng Brick and Ash Line, and Shen Bin, representative of the workers in distress, jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union yesterday, stating: "The petition is for appealing for assistance in rescuing the livelihoods of workers in distress and postponing the relocation of factory sites and returning the land. Our factories, etc., are located at 300 Lane, Yichang Road, British Concession (i.e., along the Suzhou River, West Suzhou Road). We rented and demarcated the land from the Sheng Mansion in the past and built factory buildings, which has been more than ten years ago.

Paying the rent annually. Suddenly, in the 26th year, we received a letter from Lawyer Yang Linzhi, representing China Business Corporation, notifying us of the management and ordering us to relocate and return the land. While we were contacting Mr. Dou Yaoting, the property manager of Huajing, to renew the lease, the war broke out in Shanghai, so it was put on hold. In November of that year, Lawyer Yang Linzhi, representing the plaintiff China Business Corporation Huaer Xuefu, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court,

Ordering us to relocate and return the land. After receiving the summons, the factories, etc., publicly hired Lawyer Jiang Yiping as their agent to plead. After several court sessions, we were sentenced to relocate and return the land by the end of October of the 27th year. Because the factories, etc., could not find land in various districts in the concession, we were dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. After two investigative hearings, at the third hearing, in order to follow the plaintiff's contact and not hurt feelings,

We reached a settlement limited to relocation by the end of March of the 28th year. Currently, there are more than 1,000 workers in distress who rely on working on the land for a living, as well as shantytowns. The factories, etc., are willing to return the land, but there is no land to be found in the concession area. If we go to the Chinese界 (Hua Jie - Chinese administered area), it has not yet been opened, and it concerns the reputation of Guan merchants. If we open factories, boats, ships, machines, and other items have no place to be stacked.

More than 1,000 workers and shantytowns have no livelihood, and there are more refugees in the concession area, which is also not a safe plan. Committee Member Zhu Qizhen of your association is nearby and knows the difficult situation, so he can understand it clearly. We know that American merchants value morality, so we request your association to examine and implement, provide strong assistance, and in this extraordinary period, when the war is prolonged, rescue the livelihoods of the factories, etc., persuade the landlords, and prioritize morality. Postpone the recovery of the land. If the landlords are compassionate and considerate, the factories, etc., will temporarily pay a certain amount of rent on a monthly basis, and we will relocate immediately after the difficult times of the war have passed, and there will be no reason to delay again. We will be extremely grateful to await your orders."

### Forty-Nine Japanese Police Arrive in Shanghai, Thirty Assigned to Shanghai

According to foreign sources, the Japanese side currently has an increasing number of overseas Chinese in Shanghai, reaching more than 37,000 people. The police in the original consulate police station are no longer active in various districts in Hongkou, so the Japanese Consulate General had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for additional allocations. The new Japanese police officers have now been dispatched by the province, totaling 49 people, led by Japanese patrolman Uzawa. They arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru on the 6th. It is heard that 30 of them will stay in Shanghai and be assigned to the Japanese Consulate General Police Station, while the other 19 will be assigned to Nanjing and Hankou within days.

### Haiqi Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai Hold Public Memorial Service for Zhang Tui'an, Held at Gongdelin

Fellow townsmen from Haiqi in Shanghai held a public memorial service for Mr. Zhang Tui'an of Nantong at Gongdelin yesterday afternoon. More than 60 people attended, including Liu Qizheng, Shen Jun, Zhu Baoshan, Dong Yunshu, Ji Fang, Yan Jingzhi, Wang Zhaoqing, Yan Youlian, Lu Shusheng, and Chen Bokui. The memorial hall was filled with memorial banners and elegiac couplets, and the atmosphere was solemn. The public memorial service was held at 2:00 p.m., and Liu Qizheng, Shen Jun, Zhu Baoshan, Huang Xiuzhai, and others were elected as the main officiants. The ceremony was performed according to etiquette, and Yan Youlian respectfully read the eulogy, which contained "… Brothers are harmonious, respectful of their hometown, based on the training of 加教 (jia jiao - added education) for wealth, and practice it personally. Their achievements are remarkable, like the irrigation of thousands of miles by the rivers of the Yangtze and Huai, like the silent moisturizing of spring rain. Therefore, the 嗇公 (Se Gong - thrifty public official) cannot reach greatness, and the greatness of the public is that it cannot reach refinement. Without greatness, it is impossible to achieve refinement, and without refinement, it is impossible to achieve greatness. The mutual need and assistance of the two publics is truly like the heart and limbs, so the whole country, regardless of whether they know each other or not, will not refuse to call them difficult brothers and difficult friends. And north of the Yangtze River, the hidden depths of the East Sea, clouds and mists are steaming, and people are outstanding…" The words were several thousand words long. After the memorial service, a group photo was taken. Yesterday, Master Fan Cheng led dozens of male and female lay Buddhists in chanting sutras for a full day, and Lay Buddhist Zhao Yunshao gave a discourse. The ceremony was very solemn.

### Trade Commission Selectively Purchases Local Goods from Time to Time, Relevant Local Merchants Should Register Immediately, Requesting Permission to Lift the Ban on Pig Bristles

After the Pig Trade Commission and others were ordered to purchase local goods, they have handled the registration of relevant merchants and are proceeding with the purchase, loading, and shipment of goods to the port for export, with the aim of rescuing farmers and merchants and increasing foreign exchange funds. Pig bristle and casing industries have powdered telegrams requesting a lifting of the ban. The Ministry has announced measures for the transportation of prohibited goods to Shanghai. The details are as follows:

Handling Registration and Proceeding with Purchase

The Trade Commission's Zhejiang Office sent a letter to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, etc., stating: "Dear Sirs, after the Zhejiang Customs announced the ban on the transportation of goods to Shanghai that should be settled in foreign exchange in eastern Zhejiang, most of them are stranded in Ningbo and cannot be shipped as scheduled. In order to rescue farmers and merchants and increase foreign exchange, we have presented a request to our General Association, and this office will selectively purchase them. We hereby inform you accordingly, and hope that you will check and inform all relevant merchants to come to our office to handle registration procedures from now on in order to purchase them. We are at your service."

Requesting Permission to Transport Pig Bristles to Shanghai for Brush Making

Before August 13th, there were more than 40 toothbrush factories, most of which were located in Nanshi. After the outbreak of the war, they successively moved to the concession and resumed work, with approximately 20 factories and more than 3,000 workers. Recently, due to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' ban on the transportation of pig bristles to Shanghai, the raw materials for toothbrushes have suddenly become scarce. Now, Shuanglun, Liang Xinji, Yixin, Xinxin, Standard, Mingxing, Gongshang, Aviation, Zhenyu, and other factories have jointly submitted a petition to the Chamber of Commerce to forward a telegram to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting permission to lift the ban on pig bristles and allow them to be transported to the Shanghai concession with proof in order to maintain their operations.

### Failure of Japan's Monetary Policy in North China (Part 2) - Resulting in the Sacrifice of Japanese Bank Notes - The North China Populace's Faith in the Legal Tender is Extremely Strong - Confession of Mitsuto Chuzo of Japan

Holding Back Silver - In the two concessions, because this silver was intended to be the largest support for the "Joint Reserve Bank," the attempt to seize it hindered the smooth flow of the "Joint Reserve" paper currency to a considerable extent. Another obstacle faced by the "Bank" was its inability to freely sell foreign exchange because the "Joint Reserve Bank" still did not have sufficient foreign currency deposits. Its paper currency is now on par with Japanese bank notes. In order to make the new paper currency the only bank note circulating in its jurisdiction, the "North China Provisional Government" decided to recall the old currency issued by the various North China banks that had branches in Beiping and Tianjin. Within a year starting from March 10, 1938, the old currency could be exchanged for "Joint Reserve" paper currency at par. However, the paper currency issued by the Huafang Bank, which has its head office in Shanghai, was immediately

Prohibited from Circulation - It is estimated that there are a total of 430 to 450 million yuan of old currency circulating in North China, most of which are paper currencies of the Central Bank and Bank of Communications. In the nine months from March 10, 1937, the "Joint Reserve Bank" recovered no more than 13 million yuan of old currency. The amount of "Joint Reserve" paper currency in circulation is approximately 150 million yuan, most of which was issued to pay military expenses. The "Joint Reserve Bank" imitated the "Central Bank of Manchuria" and adopted the method used by the "Central Bank" to deal with the same problem of old currency. When the "Central Bank" was established, there were approximately 140 million yuan of old currency, of which 99 percent was circulating in Manchuria, all of which was

Recovered Within Two and a Half Years - However, the situation in North China is very different from the situation in Manchuria when the "Central Bank" was established. The existence of foreign concessions is the biggest obstacle. This is because foreign banks not only do not cooperate with the work of the "Joint Reserve Bank", but also hinder it to a considerable extent. The people of North China have more faith in the old currency than in the new currency, because the old currency in Manchuria was low in price and had no credit, so the "Central Bank of Manchuria" was able to sell foreign exchange upon request at the beginning of its operation, while the "Joint Reserve Bank" could not do so. Another important obstacle is the commercial situation, because North China is not like "Manchukuo." Apart from trade with "Mongolia and Tibet", its trade deficit is quite large. All these situations have

Obtained Foreign Currency - Made progress quite slow. Although the "Joint Reserve Bank" paper currency is not worth one shilling and two pence, it is at the same price as Japanese bank notes. Because of this fact, the situation continues to become serious. Merchants were soon encouraged to purchase "Joint Reserve" paper currency with old currency, and use "Joint Reserve" paper currency to pay for imported Japanese goods. As a result, Japanese bank notes were sacrificed, and the Bank of Japan suffered the same loss. Foreign banks' refusal to recognize the new currency has added more obstacles to the "Joint Reserve Bank's" foreign exchange situation. According to what I have heard, the intention of foreign banks seems to be that they cannot accept inconvertible currencies. However, the "Joint Reserve Bank" can use

Many Methods - To overcome the above-mentioned monetary obstacles in North China, and in fact, many methods have already been implemented. In order to encourage the public to trust the new paper currency, the "Joint Reserve Bank" must obtain sufficient foreign currency deposits, and when necessary, it can use these foreign currencies to sell foreign exchange. Japanese financial commissioners stationed in China and the management department of the "Joint Reserve Bank" are currently making promising efforts to strengthen the "Bank's" strength in this regard. For the same purpose, the North China "authorities" have adopted a foreign exchange control system and implemented certain restrictions on foreign trade. A more urgent and special problem is how to deal with the expiration of the circulation period of the old legal tender in March. As of now, as described above,

Out of 400 Million Yuan - Only 13 million yuan have been recovered. The course of action thereafter will largely depend on the situation when the deadline expires. However, no matter what method is taken, the legal tender that has been in circulation for a long time may continue to circulate. The currency problem in Central China is quite similar to that in North China. Our country's (referring to Japan) military expenses are still paid in "military scrip." But in general, the people's trust in "military scrip" is definitely not higher than the North China people's trust in "Joint Reserve Bank" paper currency. And in some inland areas, the Japanese military authorities have to purchase legal tender with their own paper currency before they can purchase any goods. It was previously predicted that the legal tender would depreciate after the fall of Guangzhou, but contrary to the facts, the value of the legal tender has instead risen, and the legal tender has become a heavy burden on Japanese bank notes in the above-mentioned form. The firmness of the legal tender may be due to the efforts of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. No matter what happens to Chiang Kai-shek's fate, the value of the legal tender will still be maintained because there is a surplus in imports and exports. The Japanese army will continue to purchase goods with "military scrip." This "military scrip" will be converted into legal tender, and then legal tender will be exchanged into foreign currency. Therefore, the fundamental problem is how to deal with the legal tender. This clearly requires the establishment of a bank in Central China that issues independent paper currency. Although the bank does not have to be engaged in large-scale activities, it should be fully strong from the beginning and able to

Sell Foreign Exchange - The legal tender may be temporarily ignored, and an attempt should be made to recover it within a specified period, as was done in North China. Efforts should also be made directly to increase foreign trade so that the "Bank" in Central China may increase its foreign currency deposits. The "Bank" should not be a purely Chinese institution, but a joint venture between Chinese and Japanese capital, and its new paper currency should not be linked to Japanese bank notes like the "Joint Reserve Bank" paper currency. The reason for this is obvious: if the "Bank" is prepared to sell foreign exchange, its exchange rate value can be allowed to follow its own direction.

### Restoration of Water Transportation in the Interior of Western Shanghai - Yesterday, More Than 1,000 Civilian Boats Sailed in Formation to Clear Goods Transportation

In various places in the interior of Western Shanghai, conflicts often occurred between guerrillas and Japanese soldiers, so the small steamers and civilian boats operated by Japanese merchants dared not sail west. Recently, it has been learned that the situation has become more peaceful. Japanese soldiers send small steamers every day, carrying small steel cannons, machine guns, etc., to patrol the river channels in various places. All civilian boats with suspicious behavior must be inspected. Starting from about 10 am yesterday, until 3 pm, a large number of wooden barges and civilian boats, about 1,000 in total (including empty boats and cargo boats), sailed west from this port. However, when passing through the Beixinjing ferry, they were all subject to strict inspection. If they did not have the boat license and pass of the Civilian Boat Association, they were not allowed to pass. According to people from Qingpu County, the Qinghu long-distance bus has not yet resumed operation since it was attacked by guerrillas and bridges were destroyed.

### Puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an - Embezzlement and Malpractice To Be - The Japanese Special Service Department Is Greatly Enraged and Determined - Su Xiwen Is Instigating from the Middle and Will Continue

The establishment of the pseudo-municipal government "to date" will reach five months. Now, due to the occurrence of undercurrents, there will be a major change in the inside story. Pseudo-"Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an will be forced to step down because he has caused dissatisfaction to a certain party. Su Xiwen, the former pseudo-Director-General and current pseudo-"Secretary-General", has the hope of being promoted again to pseudo-"Mayor" and making a fool of himself. The details of the various situations are recorded as follows:

Rampant Corruption, Income Cannot Cover Expenditure - Since Fu Xiao'an indulged in his official addiction and lobbied a certain party in mid-October last year to reorganize the pseudo-"Director-General's Office" into a pseudo-"Special Municipal Government" and serve as the pseudo-"Mayor", he has exhausted all means to indiscriminately insert private individuals and increase redundant "staff" in an attempt to create a uniform situation, resulting in the pseudo-"Government's" monthly expenditure increasing from 400,000 to 600,000 yuan, and the corruption among superiors and subordinates is rampant, resulting in income not covering expenditure. In addition to spending more than 200,000 yuan of the pseudo-funds handed over by the pseudo-directorate, the pseudo-"Public Funds" are also heavily in arrears, amounting to hundreds of thousands of yuan, and cannot be compensated for by borrowing from here and there. After the pseudo-"Reformed Government" forced the cancellation of the pseudo-"Consumption Tax" last month, the pseudo-"Government's" economic predicament was completely exposed and was fully known by the Japanese special service agencies.

Old Grudges in the Su Newspaper Erupt - Su Xiwen, the former pseudo-"Director-General", was overwhelmed by Chuan Xiao'an and retreated to the pseudo-"Secretary-General". Because his old grudges were not vented, he ate vegetarian food and chanted Buddhist scriptures every day. In addition to routinely going to the pseudo-"Government" to sign in, he did not care about idle matters. On the surface, he adopted a passive attitude, and his henchmen were repeatedly excluded by Chuan Xiao'an. He also did not show any bad feelings on the outside, pretending to be okay, but he was eager to take revenge secretly and waited for an opportunity to act at any time. This time, the pseudo-"Government" had an economic panic. Su took the opportunity to report Chuan's embezzlement of pseudo-"Public Funds" to the head of the Japanese special service agency in order to force Chuan to step down. The undercurrent between Chuan and Su erupted.

Disgust for Chuan Leads to Imminent Removal - The head of the Japanese special service agency, Major General Takeshita, believing that this matter was of great importance, in addition to thoroughly investigating the pseudo-"Government's" finances and confirming that Fu Xiao'an had embezzled a large amount of funds, recognized that Chuan was too greedy and not an acceptable puppet. He secretly inquired about the lower-level pseudo-officials' feelings about Chuan, who reported that Chuan's methods were too precise and that he was too harsh on the small puppets. Therefore, due to these various factors, he developed hatred and decided to force Chuan to step down. Su Xiwen, who had been frustrated for several months, regained favor and was made to succeed Chuan as the puppet pseudo-"Mayor". The Liang Hongzhi generation also had no right to express opposition to this opinion.

Chuan's Attempt to Struggle Has Very Little Hope - Unexpectedly, Su Xiwen, knowing that the pseudo-"Mayor" chair was a sure thing, deliberately pretended to be coy. The pseudo-"Order" was originally scheduled to take the stage and make a fool of himself on the 5th of this month. He temporarily excused himself that Chuan had not handed over the pseudo-public funds he had embezzled and that there was no way to handle the finances. He was unwilling to accept the new pseudo-"Order". The special service agency then used pressure again to force Chuan to hand over the accounts clearly. At this point, Chuan was trapped in a chorus of songs and had to go to Nanjing to complain to Liang Hongzhi and others and ask them to find a way to maintain his pseudo-position. The large amount owed will be gradually repaid by him. However, according to people familiar with the inside story, there is very little hope for this trip. At most, they will find another pseudo-position for him in Nanjing to maintain Chuan's face. The pseudo-"Municipal Government" will soon undergo major changes.

### Shanghai Overcrowded - Vacant Houses Rented Out - Property Owners Have Good Business - Second Landlords Make Huge Profits

According to the French Shanghai Daily News on the 7th, according to a report by the French Jianye Real Estate Company, the prosperity of Shanghai's house rent should be at its highest between 1931 and 1933. Afterwards, due to the poor market situation, rent reduction campaigns were prevalent everywhere. Since August 13th, although the house rent in the concession has risen slightly, it is still 20% lower than between 1931 and 1933. Although the landlords want to increase the rent, in the eyes of the court, due to the current situation, most of them are not approved. Therefore, it is still difficult to restore the previous prosperity. However, fortunately, there are very few vacant houses. All houses that can be lived in have been rented out, so the income of the landlords is quite considerable. According to the company, the beneficiaries of the current prosperity of house rent in Shanghai are actually the general second landlords, and the cost of top rent is surprisingly high. This is something that the landlords cannot stop. It is said that the company's business in 1938 was excellent. The rent it collected, the rent collected by itself was 735,406 yuan, and the rent collected on behalf of others was 1,814,163 yuan, and its existing real estate is estimated to be worth a total of 9,280,926 yuan.

### Yunfei Car Answered a Call - The Driver Was Strangled to Death - The Vehicle and Corpse Were Found in Two Separate Locations in the Hongkou District - The Police Are Investigating the Reasons for the Robbery and Murder

At 9:30 pm on the 5th of this month, a Yunfei Company car with license plate 12403 answered a call at a hotel on Nanjing Road. The car was driven by driver Rong Dingrui. It was heard that at that time, there were two Japanese men, one Japanese woman, and one Chinese man in the car. The Chinese man instructed the driver to

Drive Straight to Hongkou - Unexpectedly, after this trip, both the person and the car disappeared. The next morning, they still did not return to the company, so Yunfei reported it to the police for investigation. Two days later, it was discovered by the police. A driver wearing a Yunfei Company uniform was found strangled to death with a rope in an empty, uninhabited foreign house on Jilin Road in Hongkou. After the company sent someone to identify him, it was confirmed to be correct. Later, the vehicle was found on Tiantong Road behind the Gongji Hospital in the evening. The intention is unknown, so the police are now investigating what the intention of robbing the car and

Murdering the Driver - And what the passengers intended to do, and are conducting a strict investigation in conjunction with the Japanese military and police agencies.

The Shanghai Times reported that on Sunday night or yesterday (the 6th) morning, a Chinese driver of the Yunfei Automobile Company was mysteriously assassinated, and a car was stolen. This caused the personnel of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department to

Be Full of Doubts - The abandoned car was finally found on Tiantong Road in Hongkou at about 2 pm yesterday. The deceased was a driver named Yuan Bingfu (transliteration), 48 years old, who had been employed by Yunfei Company for several years. At about 9:30 pm on Sunday afternoon, Yunfei Company received a phone call to send a car to a hotel on Nanjing Road. The company immediately sent a car from the nearest station, with the license plate number 12403, driven by Yuan. As for who the passengers were and where they ordered the driver to go, the police department

Still Did Not Know for Sure - As of late last night. The only thing that can be determined is that the passengers ordered Yuan to drive over the Baidu Bridge. After crossing the bridge, the police department could not find any trace of them. Then the car did not return to any Yunfei Company station. At 7:30 am yesterday morning, just as they were about to report to the police department, Yuan was found

Strangled to Death with a Rope - In the garden of a certain empty house on Jilin Road in the Yulin Road police district. The Yulin Road police immediately received the news and sent detectives to investigate the corpse. They saw that the deceased had been searched beside him, and all his silver notes had been robbed by the murderer. After examination by the doctor, it was known that the car driver was strangled to death between 10 pm and 11 pm on Sunday night, and the corpse was abandoned in the empty garden. Then they searched for the lost car and finally found it on Tiantong Road in Hongkou at about 2 pm.

### Appeal of Traitor Gu Yongxing Concluded - Sentence Changed to Four Years and Six Months Imprisonment - Two Detectives Declared Not Guilty

Gu Yongxing (nicknamed Ma Pi Yongxing), the Chief of General Affairs and Chief of the Second Branch of the pseudo-organization "Yu Ya Hui", was arrested by the Public Concession Police for participating in negotiations in the case of the kidnapping of a Shen in Western Shanghai. During Gu's detention, he implicated Shen Jinwen, a Chinese detective of the Huisi Police Station, and Sun Aizhong, a Chinese detective of the Chengdu Road Police Station, which caused the Police Department to jointly prosecute them in the First Special District Court according to law. As a result of the trial, Gu Yongxing was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, Shen Jinwen was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, and fined 500 yuan, and Sun Aizhong was fined 1,000 yuan. During the appeal period, Gu was returned to custody, and Shen and Sun were allowed to go out on bail. Gu, Shen, and Sun all expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment and filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. The interrogation has been completed, and yesterday the judge of the Second High Court Yu announced the judgment, revoking the original judgment, changing Gu Yongxing's sentence to four years and six months of imprisonment, and declaring Shen Jinwen and Sun Aizhong not guilty.

### Zhao Dehe's Skull Broken by Japanese Soldiers

Zhao Dehe, a Ningbo native, 35 years old, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. At about 1 pm, when passing through the North Sichuan Road Bridge, the Japanese army wanted to check his pass. Zhao took it out a little slowly. The Japanese army immediately struck Zhao's head with the butt of a gun, breaking his skull and causing brain matter and blood to flow. He was immediately injured and fell to the ground. Later, he was sent to Renji Hospital by ambulance for treatment. It is said that his injuries are serious and his life is in danger.

### Robbery on Singapore Road

The residence of a certain surname at No. 1, Lane 256, Singapore Road, Western Shanghai, was suddenly robbed by four bandits at 5:15 pm yesterday. At that time, two bandits with guns guarded the people in the house, and the remaining bandits searched separately. As a result, the bandits robbed more than 240 yuan in cash and escaped. The owner reported to the police afterwards and requested to pursue and arrest the bandits.

### Huge Amount of Cotton Yarn Stolen from Haitong Yarn Factory - Zhang Zaixing Colluded with Ronin to Steal and Sell - The Police Still Need to Pursue and Arrest the Receiving Criminals

The Xinhua Warehouse on Gansu Road in the Public Concession was recently seized by the police in charge, about 56 bales of cotton yarn worth about 20,000 gold. It was later learned that the plaintiff in the case, Han Changfu, the representative of the Haimen Datong Yarn Factory, after discovering that the goods had been stolen in February of this year, immediately sent a letter to the Cotton Yarn Association notifying all members to pay attention. The goods lost by the factory were 20-count white Flying Boat brand and should not be bought. Unexpectedly, the culprit Zhang Quanxin (alias Zaixing) from Anhui colluded with the Japanese and broker Zhang Shuqi to steal and sell the above-mentioned stolen yarn, 26 bales to a Chen and 30 bales to a Yu, each bale receiving 320 to 330 yuan in stolen money, which was divided and used. Unexpectedly, the secret was not well kept and the net of justice was inescapable. The police seized and dealt with it according to law. However, the market price of this cotton yarn is now more than 390 yuan, which is quite different, so the police still need to pursue and arrest the criminals who received the stolen goods.

### The Case of Bandit Leader Li Yongkuan and His Sons Assigned to the Second Special Court for Trial - Lin and She Narrate the Experience of Being Forced to Marry - All Defendants Deny the Accusations and the Court Debate is Postponed for Retrial

Li Yongkuan, a salt smuggler from Anhui, and his sons Li Jiaqi, Li Jiazhou, Li Bihe, etc., made a living by selling smuggled salt in Pudong, Minhang, Songjiang Caojing and other places. After the outbreak of the August 13th War and the retreat of the national army to the west, Li and his sons gathered their followers in the Punan area and formed bandits. Calling themselves the Eleventh Army, they impersonated guerrillas and set fire, killed, robbed and did whatever they wanted in places such as Xihudang Ruanxiang in Songjiang County. The families of She Zhuping, who ran a pharmacy in Xihudang Town, and Lin Rongniu, who served as a village chief, were robbed three times in a row. Finally, Lin Xiuhua, the daughter of Lin Rongsheng, and Yu Yuexian, the daughter of She Zhuping, were

Two Daughters Kidnapped - And forcibly married to Li Jiazhou and Li Bihe, and Jiazhou shot and killed Lin's mother, Jiang, and dug a pit to bury her. In April of last year, after the regular army of the Sixty-second Division surrounded and confiscated the guns of Li and others, Li could not stand in the countryside, so he took his family members and the two Lin and She daughters and moved to Shanghai. It was already September of last year. After arriving in Shanghai, they lived at No. 11, Zhongxing New Village, Ciyou Road, behind the Catholic Church in Xujiahui, Western Shanghai, and sent people to guard the two daughters, not allowing them freedom. It was not until the morning of December 10th that the two Lin and She daughters were able to

Escape in the Meantime - And threw themselves into the Sanctuary of the Virgin of the Catholic Church, requesting relief. The church reported to the French police, and on the morning of December 12th, the French police sent detectives to arrest Li Yongkuan and Li Bihe, father and son, and escorted them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. After a few days, Li Jiazhou was arrested at the intersection of Wuma Road and Shilu Road in the Public Concession and escorted to the court for joint investigation. After investigation by the detectives, they searched the homes of the Li family and found seven gold rings and one gold bracelet that had been robbed from the Lin and She families, as well as a fox fur man's robe and an ancient woman's beaded fur coat from the Lin family. After

Repeated Court Hearings - And postponements, the details have been recorded in this newspaper. It has now been learned that the court in this case is facing a problem with jurisdiction because the incident occurred in the occupied area of Songjiang. The Second Special Court has submitted a report to the Third High Court, which has forwarded it to the Supreme Court for designated jurisdiction. The Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court has now designated this case to be under the jurisdiction of the First Special Court. Yesterday afternoon, Xing Tingchang of the Liao Court continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The defendants were represented by lawyers Dong and Lan Xuzhang. The plaintiff, Lin Xiuhua, the victim, commissioned lawyer Xu Yannian to act as his agent, and attached a civil lawsuit requesting the return of

Stolen Goods - And losses. The court was informed that this case would be retried. First, the defendants Li Yongkuan, Li Jiazhou, and Li Bihe were questioned about their ages and origins. Yuan Jiahuan, the administrative director of the French Concession, stated the police investigation process and prosecuted the defendants for the three crimes of robbery, detaining people, and murder according to Articles 338, 348, and 371 of the Criminal Law. Then, detective Tao Ronglin reported the process of solving the case and arresting the defendants and searching for the stolen goods, and presented the stolen goods, gold rings, gold bracelets, and fur coats to the court. The victim,

Yao Xiuhua Claimed - That she was kidnapped on the third day of November last year and was forced to marry Li Jiazhou on the third day of December. She was unwilling. Li Yongkuan was the leader of the bandit team and ordered his sons to go out and rob. My family was robbed three times. On April 23rd of last year, Li Yongkuan directed his son Li Jiazhou to tie up me and my mother first, then lock us in the pig pen, and then drag my mother to the Yi Tomb ground, where Jiazhou shot and killed her with three consecutive shots. I request that justice be served.

She Yuexian Claimed - That Li and his sons came to my house on the ninth day of November last year, tied up and beat my parents, and forced me to marry Li Bihe with guns. Because I was forced, I wrote a marriage certificate myself and was then kidnapped, etc. Up to this point in the interrogation, the court ordered Li and his three sons to be interrogated separately. All denied the accusations of robbery, murder, and forced marriage. They said that the marriage with Lin and She was made by Lu Baoren, the doctor of Xihudang Town, and Cai Dingyi. The Lin family sent 64 yuan in gifts, and the She family sent 160 yuan in gifts. Li Yongkuan also confessed that he was once a captain of the water police team, but the confessions of the three fathers and sons were

Inconsistent - And Li's mistress, Yao, specially went to Xihudang to ask Lu Baoren and Cai Dingyi to come to Shanghai. They arrived at the case yesterday to prove the process of being matchmakers, which was also inconsistent. After checking the confessions of the Li father and sons, they were even more contradictory. Finally, Zhang Honghui, the brother-in-law of Lin Xiuhua, arrived in court and claimed that the two witnesses, Lu Baoren and Cai Dingyi, had come to my house the day before yesterday and asked Lin and She to not attack them in court today, otherwise their lives would be in danger. At this point, the court debate was postponed to the 25th for retrial. The defendants requested bail, but the court ruled that the case was of great importance and bail was not allowed. They were still ordered to be

Detained.

### Lawyer Chen Xingmin Ambushed Yesterday; Leg Shot, Minor Injury; Attack Likely Result of Case-Related Grudges

Lawyer Chen Xingmin, a native of Ningbo, is 31 years old and resides at No. 7, Lane 568, Bubbling Well Road. Yesterday, a man calling himself Wang Liang visited his office twice, but Chen was out and did not meet him. Last night at 8 PM, Wang Liang returned and they spoke. Wang claimed to have a legal matter and several clients waiting for Chen at a certain address in Hongfu Lane, Yu Qiaqing Road, New Zha Road. Chen, recalling a previous case involving Wang, readily agreed. He boarded Wang's rented car, while Wang took a streetcar to Hongfu Lane. Upon reaching the lane entrance, Chen felt a sudden need to relieve himself and asked Wang to go ahead. While Chen was relieving himself in the lane, Wang suddenly turned hostile, pulled out a gun, and fired two shots at Chen, one missing and one hitting Chen's left leg. Chen fell to the ground. Seeing his purpose achieved, the assailant fled the lane. Fortunately, nearby police officers, alerted by the sound, arrived quickly and rushed Chen to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The wound was not life-threatening, and after bandaging, Chen was able to leave and recuperate at home. As for the motive behind the attack, Chen stated during the police investigation that he had previously represented Wang in a case, but the evidence was insufficient, and their goals were not achieved, possibly leading to Wang's resentment and violent act. The police are continuing their investigation.

### Serial Thief of Escort Girls' Jewelry; Debate Concluded, Awaiting Judgment

Chen Meimei, a female employee of the Shunfeng escort agency, spent the night of August 18th last year with Lin Genmai at the China Hotel. The next morning, Lin took her to the New New Teahouse for breakfast. Chen was persuaded to drink excessively by Lin and became drunk. Upon waking up, she discovered that two gold rings were stolen from her hand by Lin. Recently, Lin was apprehended by Hua Detective Wang Shanqing of the Old Zha Police Station and taken into custody by the Special First Court. During the investigation, it was discovered that Lin had committed three similar cases: (1) Zhou [blank] Qin, a female employee of the Xiaohuayuan No. 10 escort agency on Shantou Road, had a gold ring and a watch stolen from her at the Taoyuan Restaurant on Nanjing Road on February 26th of this year; (2) Zhao Yifang, an employee of the Yang Guifei escort agency at No. 25 Shantou Road, had a gold ring stolen from her while she was asleep in Room 163 of the Asia Hotel at No. 571 Hankou Road on January 26th; (3) Hu Ping, an employee of the Queen Escort Agency at No. 25 Shantou Road, accompanied Lin for one night at a hotel on January 21st. The next morning, while Hu went to the bathroom at the Xinhua Restaurant on Guangxi Road, 30 yuan in legal tender and a watch were stolen. This case was further investigated by Judge Feng Shide in the Criminal Division this morning. Zhao Huifang and Zhou Xueqin were absent due to illness. Only Hu Ping testified to the facts of the case. Lin fully confessed. Police lawyer Ru Bao [blank] argued that Lin's actions constituted robbery, or at least theft, and that Lin engaged in this as a means of livelihood, so he should be punished severely as a habitual thief. Judge Feng then declared the debate concluded and scheduled a date for sentencing.

### The First Inventor of Artificial Dyes: Dr. Perkin

— Xin Jun

Sir William H. Perkin was born in London on March 12, 1838. This year, March 12th, marks his 101st birthday. At the age of fifteen, he was admitted to the Royal College of Chemistry, where he was taught by the famous chemist Hoffmann. He progressed rapidly, and after two years, he was allowed to begin research work. His research question was to separate carbon monoxide from coal tar and nitrate it. Although the results were not satisfactory, he was not discouraged. He continued to do other research, which was quite successful, and he joined the school as a teacher.

In 1856, Perkin was engaged in studying how to make quinine, using commercial aniline to oxidize it. The result was a dark precipitate. Continuing the experiment, he created the famous aniline purple dye. The success of artificial dyes began here, laying the foundation for the modern coal tar dye industry.

Until 1868, Perkin never forgot the first thing he studied—carbon monoxide—and continued his research, obtaining a method for making alizarin from carbon monoxide. Alizarin is a natural dye. Although others, such as Caro, Graebe, and Libermann, also invented new methods of manufacturing it, until 1870, Perkin's factory, Greenford Green Works, was still the only chemical factory that made artificial alizarin.

From the beginning, Perkin had the noble ambition to pursue research to find the truth. Therefore, while engaged in the dye industry, he continued to study problems that had nothing to do with industry. Therefore, in 1868, he was able to publish the method of producing coumarin, and later he published the method of producing cinnamic acid. Therefore, all those who study organic chemistry know that there is a Perkin reaction.

In 1874, Perkin left the industry and devoted himself to scientific research. He built a research laboratory in Sudbury and spent several years studying the problem of magnetic rotation. In 1906, when the 50th anniversary of the invention of purple dye was held, many famous chemists from various countries went to congratulate him. Perkin died on July 14 of the following year at the age of sixty-nine.

### The Shape and Size of the Earth

— Yimin

That the earth is a sphere is now known by almost everyone. However, before the development of science in our country, it was universally believed that the earth was square and the sky was round. In Europe, as early as 340 BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle advocated that the earth was spherical, and had already roughly calculated the circumference of the earth. Although this theory existed at the time, because of the immaturity of mathematics, the simplicity of instruments, and the obstruction of transportation, it went on for more than two thousand years without any further progress.

The initial method of proving that the earth is a sphere must be based on astronomical observations, not from the earth itself. Therefore, treating the earth as a perfect sphere, that is, a sphere in geometry, is already in line with the ideal and is considered accurate enough. It was not until the 17th century that Newton, based on the principles of mechanics, first advocated that the earth was an "oblate spheroid." After the hard work of many scholars, this theory was finally proven by actual measurement in 1750.

After the 19th century, mathematics made great progress, instruments gradually became more precise, and measurement methods became more ingenious. Thus, on the earth itself, many arcs were actually measured, and calculations were carried out to determine the shape and size of the earth. This science is called "geodesy." In 1859, the Russian Xu Peite determined that the earth was an "ellipsoid," that is, the radii of its three main axes are not equal, and any cross-section is an ellipse. Following this, there was the theory of the "egg-shaped sphere," because the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth are not symmetrical, and the southern hemisphere is slightly larger. In 1872, this theory was denied again, because the earth is not exactly like an egg-shaped rotating body, but a very irregular shape. It is called the "earth's body" because it cannot be named.

In recent decades, research on the shape of the earth can be said to have not received much attention. Because the shape of the earth is too irregular, it is not very convenient in practical use. Only by assuming that it is an oblate spheroid, like the one introduced by Newton, that is, formed by an ellipse rotating around its shorter axis, that is, the earth's polar axis, can it be applied in geodetic surveys and astronomical observations. The difference between this oblate ball and the actual shape is extremely small, and it will hardly affect the accuracy of the calculation.

The size of the earth has three different values, all determined by its long and short radii. That is, the meridian circle passing through the earth's poles and equator at right angles is an ellipse. The axis of this ellipse, in the equatorial half, is the long axis, and the one in the polar half is the short axis. Scholars from various countries have slightly different values for the long and short axes that can be measured. However, in 1909, the American surveyor Hayford measured the long radius to be 6,378,388 meters and the short radius to be 6,356,909 meters, which has been designated as the international standard by the International Association of Geodesy and Geophysics in 1924, so it should also be adopted in our country.

### The Wonders of the Sun

— Xihu Zhaizhu

As early as 214 BC, during the siege of Syracuse, it is said that the Greek mathematician Archimedes used many burning mirrors on the shore to concentrate the sunlight on the sails of Roman warships, causing the enemy ships to catch fire and collapse.

The French biologist Bnffon used 168 small mirrors in 1747 to reflect sunlight and focus it on one point, which could set wood on fire at 70 yards, melt lead at 33 yards, and melt silver at 16 yards.

Recently, the famous American scientist Dr. C. Abbott has created a solar stove using a similar principle, which can cook a rich meal using only reflected and focused sunlight. This stove can generate a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius.

That humans and plants can live and grow on the earth is all thanks to two hundred millionths of the total heat emitted by the sun.

In the UK alone, about 250 million tons of coal are mined each year. But according to Professor S. P. Langley's calculations, even if all the coal in all the coal mines in the world were burned, it would not generate as much heat as the sun emits in one-tenth of a second.

Hard and heavy metals on Earth, such as lead, iron, zinc, copper, and silver, would become gases and float if placed in the sun's lower atmosphere, just like oxygen and hydrogen float in the Earth's lower atmosphere.

It is calculated that the temperature inside the sun is about 80 million degrees Fahrenheit. If its colder outer layer were suddenly removed and the core exposed, the Earth itself and everything on it could melt and disappear, even faster than a snowflake disappears in a furnace.

Even a very small thing, such as a walnut, only needs to have its temperature raised to the above-mentioned temperature inside the sun, then if this walnut is in Japan, it can make China so hot that people cannot live in it.

### The Alarming Loss of Rust

— Xi Wu

The rusting of metal is only a trivial matter in the minds of ordinary people, but according to calculations by a famous American engineer, the loss suffered worldwide due to metal rusting is about 500 billion US dollars each year, which is more than nine times the total cost of President Roosevelt's proposed expansion plan for the army, navy, and air force (552,000,000 US dollars)!

This engineer told us that one-quarter of the world's iron turns into rust or iron oxide every year; in other words, it turns back into iron ore. Theoretically speaking, iron oxide can be refined back into pure iron, but in reality it is impossible, because most of the rust has been lost and cannot be collected.

### Scientific Anecdotes

Curing Locusts

Locusts are very harmful. In ancient times in our country, there were people who caught locusts, and there are still people who do it today. Some people also say that it is a natural disaster, that the locust god is rampant and punishes one party's sins. This is the superstition of ignorant people in rural areas due to backward education. It is unexpected that in Western countries with developed science, there are things like this that are laughable. In past years, there was a severe locust plague in Utah in the United States. Trees and fields were all damaged. Most of the people in this province are Mormons (a branch of Christianity), so they supported the old and the young and knelt down in the fields to pray. The place was near Great Alt Lake, where seagulls (Gnlls) gathered. Seagulls like to eat locusts. In a short time, they captured almost all of the locusts there. When the prayer was over, the disciples were delighted to see that there were no locusts in the fields and thought that God had responded because of their sincere prayers.

Dream Fish

Louis Agassiz was a great biologist. He wrote many books throughout his life and made extremely rich contributions. Great European biologists such as Darwin and Huxley all praised him. He was the most courageous and精進 in his research, and all those who studied under him were influenced by him and later became famous figures in this field. When he was young, he studied in Paris and studied fish fossils in the museum. He happened to encounter an important species, but the fossil was too damaged and broken. He barely pieced it together, but in the end he could not get its characteristics. After studying it for a long time, he was physically and mentally exhausted. One night, he was so tired that he fell asleep, and he still remembered the fish in his heart. He suddenly saw the fish swimming in front of him, with every scale and fin clearly visible. The next morning, he sorted out the specimens, but he could no longer remember what he had dreamed of the night before. He continued to attack it, but still failed. After a few days, he dreamed of it again at night, and the next morning he forgot again. So he worked harder and secretly thought that if the fish entered his dream again, he should draw it in his dream for reference. So he placed a pencil and paper beside his pillow. After several months, he finally dreamed of it again. He woke up in the morning and began to work. He suddenly remembered what had happened at night. He rushed back to the bedroom to search for it and found the picture. Therefore, with his help, he completed the assembly of the damaged fossil, and the important characteristics of the fish species can be examined in detail.

Survival in the Whale's Belly

An Englishman was hunting whales in the Atlantic Ocean. A large whale swept past his boat. He quickly shot at it. The whale flicked its tail, and the boat capsized. The man was thrown into the sea, and the whale caught him in its huge mouth and swallowed him. The man entered the whale's esophagus and suddenly felt a great pressure behind him, pushing him forward. He groped around with his hands and found that everything was soft and smooth, as if he had fallen into a dark world. He knew very well that he would be buried in the whale's belly and would never see the light of day again. Gradually, he felt hot steam, which was extremely unbearable. He fell into a coma and knew nothing. When he woke up, he was in a hospital ward. It turned out that after the whale swallowed the man, it was killed by other hunters. They cut open its belly and found the man, whose breath was only alive. They sent him to the hospital. The skin on his face and body was eroded by the whale's gastric juice. (The man described this experience in detail in a magazine.)

### Talking Machine

— Yuan Zhen

This talking machine, called "Voder," was invented by scientists H. W. Dudley and R. R. Riesz of the Bell Telephone Company's laboratory in England.

It is a portable machine that can be placed on a small table, and can be attached with several loudspeakers to reach a large audience. It has a set of keys and a dozen regulators. Technicians need to study how to mix and regulate the sounds it makes until they are proficient before they can use it and achieve the desired effect. It does not use any records. Technicians only need to press the keys and use the regulators to produce various languages. This is indeed the first machine to manufacture languages.

The Talking Machine has one advantage over humans. The sounds it makes range from the lowest to the highest, and can include everything, unlike the sounds made by each person, which can only be limited to a part. (Scientific Intelligence,)

A close-up of a talking machine in the Xiang'er Telephone Laboratory. This young woman is pressing the keys with her hand, emitting a language like a human voice.

### Solar Furnace

— Ye Ren

Dr. Charles Wilson of the Smithsonian Institute in the United States has built a solar furnace on a mountaintop in California that can bake bread and cook various foods. The heat source of the furnace is sunlight, and the medium for heat transfer is oil. The furnace is equipped with a rotating reflector that can follow the sun from east to west, concentrating sunlight on a group of copper pipes filled with oil. When the pipes are scorched by sunlight, the heated oil in the pipes naturally rises without the aid of a pump and flows into the furnace, which is tightly wrapped in heat-resistant material. When the oil cools, it sinks to the bottom of the furnace due to gravity and returns to the copper pipes to wait for sunlight to heat it again. Because the heat-resistant material of the furnace can absorb a large amount of heat, the furnace can still cook for a long time even after sunset.

Lightning Protection for the Soviet Palace

The Soviet Palace currently under construction is the tallest building in the world. After two years of lightning protection research on the palace's model, engineers and architects have decided to use grounded metal plates as lightning rods for the palace. A 300-foot-high Lenin statue will be installed on top of the building, and measures must also be taken to protect it. The metal plates used will be connected to the ground via the steel frame of the main building. During the construction process, a cable-grounded balloon will be raised to a height of approximately two thousand feet to intercept any sky discharges and protect the ongoing construction work.

Huge Vacuum Tube Rectifier

Wireless vacuum tubes have made astonishing new progress and will be used to transmit millions of kilowatts of electricity over long distances. These vacuum tubes are up to six feet tall and can withstand enormous voltages and heat. At the generator end, they convert high-voltage alternating current into high-voltage direct current, which is transmitted along transmission lines. At the point of use, another vacuum tube converts the direct current back into alternating current. Traditionally, long-distance power transmission has been limited to alternating current rather than direct current because alternating current is easier to generate and easier to step up or down. However, with the current alternating current system, the economic limit of power transmission is only about two hundred miles. If extended to three hundred miles, leakage along the way will reach fifty percent. Now, if direct current transmission is used, there is no loss because there is no changing magnetic field around the power line. Direct current flows steadily in the same direction, like a river with a constant flow rate. Its flow rate depends only on the voltage of the transmission line and the resistance of the wire. The engineers' long-held wish to use direct current transmission has now been achieved thanks to the new development of this type of giant rectifier tube.

Extracting Magnesium from Seawater

A German chemist has recently invented a new method of extracting magnesium and has registered it with the German government. The traditional method of producing magnesium involves extracting it from ordinary magnesite ore. This new method extracts it from magnesium chloride—a component of seawater—using hydrogen to combine with the chlorine in magnesium chloride and precipitate metallic magnesium.

Sound Warfare

Sound may be one of the weapons in future wars, its sharpness no less than bombs and poison gas. Recently, a Frenchman invented a method of deafening enemy soldiers' eardrums with a huge sound and has registered it with the patent office. This sound is emitted from phonograph records and then amplified to the extreme using loudspeaker arrays.

### "March 8th" and Donations

— Mao Lie

The 700,000 yuan donation from women in Chongqing is a good example for women in Shanghai!

The number of wealthy women in Shanghai is no less than in Chongqing. And I believe the consumption of wealthy women in Shanghai must be more than that of wealthy women in Chongqing. Because Chongqing is far inland, the general enjoyment is simple. It is impossible to consume as much as one would like. Shanghai is different. In terms of enjoyment, everything is available, and it has always been a "leaky jar." So, if wealthy women in Shanghai, even those who are not very wealthy, can save a little and make donations, the results will be satisfactory. Although it may not necessarily exceed Chongqing, it should not let Chongqing take all the credit.

However, to this day, I have not heard of any actions taken by Shanghai women regarding donations. Why is this? Does what Chairman Chiang said, "The power of women is greater than that of men," only apply to Chongqing and not to Shanghai?

I believe that the power of women is greater than that of men in certain aspects; at least in frugality and almsgiving, women are more powerful than men. However, why are Shanghai women silent and unheard of regarding donations? Why is their consumption still increasing?

I am not saying that the patriotism of Shanghai women is inferior to that of Chongqing women; however, I must say that the active power of Shanghai women is indeed quite lacking. The formation of this deficiency is probably due to the fact that women leaders are unwilling to take the initiative, and people in society, especially the organizations responsible for guiding the people's movement, are unwilling to promote it from the side.

Now, "March 8th" has arrived. What we have already seen in the newspapers is: "In this time of national crisis, celebratory ceremonies are suspended," and in addition, there is a declaration. Although the declaration also says that women should "save the nation" and "make donations," we have not seen these concrete actions.

I do not believe that in a city as large as Shanghai, with so many wealthy women, there is no such thing as women's donations!

If wealthy women are unwilling to take the initiative, why do ordinary women and young ladies not contribute even a little?

The Shanghai women's community is so silent, especially regarding donations, so indifferent, that I simply have to say that Shanghai should not have a "March 8th"!

### The Death of Fourth Master Zhao

— He Longsheng

(1)

Fourth Master Zhao's presence in Jiangqiao was like that of a living Buddha in Tibet. Everyone knew and respected him.

As the war moved westward, gradually approaching Jiangqiao, Fourth Master's spirit became even more melancholy. Later, he instructed his family to quickly prepare their luggage and go to Xicun, sixty miles away, for temporary refuge. He also gave three hundred yuan in legal tender to his eldest daughter, urging her to leave quickly. Amid tears and sobs, his family finally boarded a small boat and left Jiangqiao.

(2)

"Fourth Master, wake up! The soldiers are outside the city." The chairman of the Jiangqiao Chamber of Commerce, without washing his face or putting on his hat, rushed straight to Fourth Master Zhao's bedroom to discuss how to deal with the situation.

"What? They're outside the city? Weren't they still fighting by the river?" Fourth Master asked in surprise as he sat up.

"We've run out of bullets here. The enemy added more troops last night, so we couldn't hold on and retreated into the city." The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce explained to Fourth Master.

"Hmm, so are there any more ammunition in the city?" Fourth Master asked urgently as he got out of bed.

"There isn't any. That's why I came to ask Fourth Master…" The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce was anxious when the sound of an airplane rang in the air. Fourth Master Zhao knew the situation was very dangerous, so he resolutely said:

"In that case, it's probably impossible to defend the city. Since there are no bullets in the city and reinforcements from outside won't arrive for a while, I think we should let the troops rush out of the city quickly. The troops can find ways to resupply outside. Once they have enough weapons, they can attack the city again. We people in the city can provide internal support. We don't have to worry about the enemy not being completely wiped out!"

"Buzz buzz buzz… Boom—"

"Buzz buzz buzz… Boom—"

The enemy planes had already started dropping bombs, and chaotic shouts immediately arose within the city; the cannons also began to thunder.

"Boom… Boom…"

"Boom… Boom…"

"Boom boom boom… Boom…"

"Pa'er, squeak—"

"Pa'er, squeak—"

"Guruguruguru, guruguruguru, boom—"

All kinds of strange gunshots rang above people's heads. Smoke billowed in the sky; the city center had already begun to emit black smoke, and flames continued to rise. Fourth Master was putting on his slippers and running down the street.

The situation was even more chaotic, and the streets were filled with pedestrians. Men, women, old, and young, their cries mixed together. Fourth Master's face was very bitter, but he did not say a word and kept running towards the Wenmiao, where the garrison was stationed. The plane roared wildly, and bullets continued to fly in the sky. Flames rose from all sides. The garrison in the temple had already set off. Fourth Master hurriedly ran out of the temple and ran to Xu Wenbin's house. Xu Wenbin was nowhere to be found, but his family was gathered in the hall, crying. Fourth Master felt that things were even more difficult, so he had to leave again; then he ran to the main street and knocked on the door of the Juxinyuan Restaurant.

"Who is it?" There was a response from inside, but the door did not open.

"I am Fourth Master Zhao!" Fourth Master had to announce himself.

"Ah! Fourth Master. Come in quickly! We thought you had already left."

The door only opened a crack, Fourth Master slipped in, and then it closed again. In another room, Fourth Master and the owner and cooks murmured for a long time before he came out. The restaurant owner, who was sending Fourth Master out, had a difficult look on his face; the cook behind the owner, however, was grinning.

(3)

It was twenty-four hours after the * * army entered the city. Fourth Master Zhao, in his capacity as chairman of the local maintenance association, hosted a banquet for the * * army's officers, large and small, at the Chamber of Commerce. In addition to more than thirty military officers from the * * army, there were also ordinary local special figures who had been frustrated in the past but were now working for the * * army. To encourage the guests to eat and drink more, Fourth Master Zhao talked expansively about the * * army's kindness and drank a lot of wine. But before the banquet ended, he fell asleep. Everyone thought he was drunk, and they continued to eat and drink merrily. After a while, the guests all showed strange symptoms; some shouted about stomach pain, some said they were dizzy, and finally, they all fell to the ground. In the end, a total of twenty-six * * army officers and five local special figures died.

Zhao Siye was accused of premeditated murder, taken away, and, under the muzzles of the * * army's military police, dozens of bullets were fired into his woodenly unaware body.

### Commemorating March 8th (Woodcut)

### My Heart

— Liu You

Although I am trapped in this dark hell, my heart is no longer here!

I don't know how my heart left here. Did it fly out? Did it jump out? In any case, it struggled out.

My heart is pure, and filth cannot stain it!

My heart is bright, and darkness cannot cover it!

My heart is noble, and baseness cannot crush it!

My heart has gone out. It bears a great mission. It is going to "seek."

It is not seeking the world of bliss, the land of gold, or the ivory tower; it does not need these!

It is not seeking beautiful flowers, luminous pearls, or jade and agate; it does not love these!

It is going to seek "justice." In "justice" is hidden the sharpest weapon, to be used to fight in the darkness!

My heart has gone without fear. It does not want to dream golden dreams under the claws of devils!

It has gone, flown away, jumped away, I don't know!

My heart has gone out! It bears a great mission!

### Sending to Friends from Afar

— Luo Hua

It's a light piece of paper,

Writing two sparse lines of poetry;

It's these sparse two lines,

With a heart full of thoughts concealed.

A year has passed since parting,

Deeply recalling the year of parting:

That solemn silence in the clear night facing each other;

Now I should silently pray for your strength and health.

A burst of gunfire, a burst of smoke,

A moment of leisure after a burst of sound,

How you must concentrate your thoughts,

Thinking of the homeland you dream of!

The homeland after separation,

The devastation suffered should let past sorrows go;

Now comfort your longing thoughts,

Look, hidden in the homeland are iron fences!

Just a light piece of paper,

Just two sparse lines of poetry;

It's these sparse two lines,

With a heart full of thoughts concealed.

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

Regimental Commander Ye handed the reorganization plan to One-Eyed Li, but One-Eyed Li couldn't read a single word, so he had to blush and hand it to Pockmarked Xiao. Pockmarked Xiao took it and read it once. The conditions on it were very simple. First, they had to hand over the list of guns and the names of the troops, and second, they had to eliminate the weak and retain the strong, and refresh the organization. However, the most important thing they were concerned about, their individual positions after the reorganization, was not mentioned at all in the plan.

Pockmarked Xiao winked at One-Eyed Li and handed the plan back to Regimental Commander Ye, sneering:

"Isn't this method just to annex us? If you want to annex us, just say so outright. Why go around in circles?"

Regimental Commander Ye's thick eyebrows jumped, and he put his hand on the cup and said:

"Don't misunderstand, I mean well. I hope you join us so that we can increase the strength of the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare."

"Thank you! Thank you!" Pockmarked Xiao sneered and cupped his hands upwards, saying, "Please don't use nice words to deceive us anymore. You are in Hepu Town, and we are in Tiaoxi Town. We don't interfere with each other…………"

Regimental Commander Ye couldn't bear it any longer. His square face turned red with anger. He jumped up and smashed a wine glass in his hand on the ground with a "ping" sound, saying:

"What do you mean, we don't interfere with each other! I am an official appointed by the National Government's Military Affairs Commission. I have the responsibility to protect the people and eliminate violence and maintain order. I can't let you bandits run wild in the local area and act lawlessly!"

This was a signal. In the sound of the glass breaking, the soldiers ambushing behind the screen door rushed out, each holding a rifle or box cannon in their hands. Seeing that the situation was not good, Pockmarked Xiao overturned the table with one hand, and One-Eyed Li added a kick, knocking the table over as well. They each pulled out their weapons from their waists. Although One-Eyed Li only had one eye, he could shoot with both hands. In the blink of an eye, a series of gunshots rang out in the hall, and the soldiers ambushing in the left and right厢房 also opened fire. In this T-shaped crossfire, Pockmarked Xiao shouted "Aiyo" and fell to the ground with a thud. One-Eyed Li, however, was still very brave, running outwards while shooting backwards with both hands.

Seeing that One-Eyed Li was so brave, Regimental Commander Ye was afraid that he would escape, so he took a revolver from Deputy Regimental Commander Liang and personally fired three shots at him. All three shots hit One-Eyed Li, but strangely, One-Eyed Li still ran outwards unharmed. (27)

### Two Puppet Emperors of the Song Dynasty

— Jie

——Random Notes on Reading History

When the Jin people invaded the Song Dynasty, they twice established puppet governments to implement the poisonous scheme of using Chinese to control Chinese. The first time was in the second year of Jingkang. The Jin soldiers attacked Bianjing and took Emperors Huizong and Qinzong captive, establishing Song minister Zhang Bangchang as the Emperor of Chu. However, when the Jin soldiers returned north, Zhang Bangchang also abdicated, only serving as a short-lived emperor for thirty-six days. The second time a puppet government was established was in the third year of Jianyan. The Jin people established Liu Yu as the Emperor of Qi. Liu Yu enjoyed being emperor for eight years before being deposed by the Jin people.

Although Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu were both traitors cursed by the ages, there was a difference in their degree of treachery. Zhang Bangchang became a puppet because he was forced by the Jin people, not voluntarily. Therefore, after he ascended the throne as a puppet, he still had some scruples and did not dare to act recklessly. He summoned officials and called himself "Yu" (I), not daring to call himself "Zhen" (We, the Emperor). When appointing officials, he added the word "Quan" (temporary), indicating that it was a temporary nature. He sent people to welcome Prince Kang of Song and himself pleaded, "The reason why I reluctantly followed the Jin people's establishment was to expediently deal with the situation temporarily in order to alleviate the national crisis. I dare not have other intentions." It can be seen that Zhang Bangchang was not considered a traitor, but only a confused puppet!

But Liu Yu was a complete and thorough traitor! Liu Yu became a puppet not because the Jin people supported him, but because he sought it out himself. He bribed the enemy Tartar. After serving as a false emperor for eight years, he not only had no shame or scruples, but willingly acted as the enemy's dog, leading troops to invade his ancestral country several times. He can truly be considered to have lost his mind!

Neither of these two treasonous fellows, Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu, had good endings. Although Zhang Bangchang later returned to the Song Dynasty, traitors and rebellious officials were not tolerated by national law, and he was eventually ordered to commit suicide by Emperor Gaozong of Song. Liu Yu was able to ascend the throne because he had the support of key Jin figures Tartar and Nianhan; but later, Tartar and Nianhan lost power, and his backing collapsed. The traitor lost his support and was eventually deposed by his master (the Jin people). The Jin people imprisoned him in Jinming Pond, and the false emperor became a prisoner. In the end, he died weakly in the enemy country. The endings of these two puppet emperors were equally tragic and can serve as a warning to current traitors!

### Commemorating March 8th

Strengthening the Promotion of the Women's Movement

Although some Chinese women participated in the revolution as early as the great revolutionary era before the Xinhai Revolution, and some even died for it (like the famous martyr Qiu Jin), this was only a very small minority. It was limited to a relatively progressive small part of the educated people at the time. They were only a tiny fraction of the total population of women in the country, accounting for less than one percentage point. Although the participation of women in the successive revolutionary movements after the Xinhai Revolution had gradually expanded and become more popular, it was still a minority, a part. Therefore, strictly speaking, the real women's movement only began after the outbreak of the all-out war of resistance on July 7th. The July 7th Incident not only replaced the ancient Chinese nation with a new epoch-making symbol, leading the entire Chinese nation to unite and resist the violent enemy with all its strength, but also prompted women to embark on the path of liberation and freedom spontaneously and consciously.

During this war of resistance, the number of Chinese women mobilized undoubtedly broke all records in history. Under the first great * * of the War of Resistance, large numbers of returning women, along with the evolution of the war, have swarmed out of the kitchen, abandoned their love for their children, and joined mass organizations. They went to the front line and, under the rain of guns and cannons, engaged in rescuing wounded soldiers. They were busy with medical treatment and nursing under the Japanese planes that specialized in bombing civilians, rescue personnel, and the lives and property of third countries. They worked tirelessly in the front and rear, doing various national salvation work, working day and night without any complaints. They were as brave, capable, diligent, and hard-working as men. A certain foreign reporter, after inspecting China, praised Chinese women as the most advanced women in the world, which is a very faithful criticism.

However, what we want to clearly point out is that although the women's movement after the War of Resistance has made considerable progress in both quality and quantity, from an overall perspective, the women's movement still has the shortcomings of being superficial, fragmentary, and limited to the upper class. It has not penetrated into the ranks of working women, rural women, and lower-class women who account for the majority of women in the country. It has not universally promoted the women's movement to the border areas that will be the future base areas of the War of Resistance. It has always remained in the local prosperous cities. The adverse consequences of this are that it cannot cooperate with the universality and comprehensiveness necessary for the comprehensive and long-term War of Resistance, because they are dotted, linear, and unorganized.

Especially the women in Shanghai who remain on the isolated island, perhaps they think that the westward movement of the war is no longer related to themselves, so they still live as usual, playing cards, watching operas, dancing, and showing off, these occupy all of them, and at the same time, they carelessly use enemy goods, which makes the import surplus of enemy goods increase dramatically. In their eyes, the War of Resistance is a matter for some people.

On the occasion of commemorating the March 8th International Women's Day today, we hope that after the women have gone through the formalities of the meeting, the former women who have participated in the War of Resistance will, based on their past spirit, focus on in-depth and universal grassroots work, while the latter should immediately correct their wrong, absurd, and selfish attitude, and at least stand in their own positions and implement things that are beneficial to the War of Resistance, such as not buying and selling enemy goods, not going to chaotic places, saving and helping refugees, and soliciting donations to purchase public bonds.

In summary, if women want to complete the women's liberation movement in the War of Resistance, they must join the War of Resistance themselves, and at the same time, irrigate the awareness of the War of Resistance to the lower-class women's groups, so that the women's movement can develop universally.

### Sisters, Quickly Put on Your New Clothes!

— He Zizuo

### Observations on Prison Paradise

— Li Zhihua

Up The RIVER

Produced by 20th Century Fox, Premiering at the Grand Theater

"Up the River" is a slapstick comedy set in a prison. Perhaps precisely because it is a comedy, the gloomy feeling of detective films is swept away, replaced by something like a sanatorium or club. The newspaper advertisements for "Up the River" say: "Enter the prison with a smile, as if ascending to paradise: come and go as you please, win trophies in ball games. You can meet your lovers, you can sing and dance, you'll have three square meals with wine and rice until the day you die." The depiction of the prison is so glorified that it is fascinating. Not long ago, we read in the social news about a person who could not solve his livelihood problem and confessed to stealing to request imprisonment. At that time, it aroused some cheap sympathy, thinking that his situation was sad and his person pitiful, and that life was as it should be. Now, after watching "Up the River," which "enters the prison with a smile, as if ascending to paradise," it is felt that this person who confessed to stealing is not without being a smart person, for "three square meals a day and a night to sleep," which is better than sleeping in a lane, eating leather shoes, getting kicked, and starving.

In this way, it is quite suspected of encouraging poor people to commit crimes. In the event that they follow suit and break into the prison, or are forced to hang out a full sign, wouldn't even the police authorities be at a loss? In fact, prison life is of course not as "carefree" as described in "Up the River," but we already have people who confess to stealing in order to get three meals a day and a night's sleep (in the United States, there will be people like this, right?). If you mistake comedy for seriousness, and want to ascend to "heaven," what will happen?

This seems like a groundless worry. Prison is not a free sanatorium, just as prison cannot transform society. However, to beautify prison and describe it as "paradise" is absurd, nonsensical, and useless. A fool who mistakes comedy for seriousness and recognizes prison as paradise probably won't exist, right? But what about the theme of "Up the River"?

The motives for making Hollywood movies can mostly be included in "business eyes." The absurdity, nonsense, and fantasy of comedy films are even more commonplace and not surprising. Therefore, in the prison, "winning trophies in ball games," "being able to sing and dance," and even men dressing up as women and dancing in strange voices, seem like a matter of course. This is why comedy films are welcomed by gentlemen and ladies and are getting worse and worse, which also proves to what stage the so-called art of capitalism has reached.

It is true that "Up the River" also writes about so-called "friendship": "Tommy wants to escape from prison to Spring Valley to expose a secret plot. When Morda and the two heard about it, they were willing to help him and agreed to escape on the night of the carnival in prison. Morda and the two thought that Tommy was about to be sworn in and released from prison, and that escaping from prison would be unfavorable, so they knocked Tommy unconscious on the ground at the time of the escape, and hurriedly dressed in women's clothes and pretended to be women." However, this is not so much to describe "friendship" as it is to sell gimmicks or to make the final climax come true. In the final climax of this comedy, these two escaped "star players" are needed to win glory for the Rocker Prison team.

In short, all the arrangements are to make the comedy film become a mixed bag. The use of prison as a background, to put it bluntly, is to melt eroticism, tension, and comedy into one furnace. Prison is the best background to become tense.

The director and the script are unified, and he also tries his best to emphasize this point, such as men dressing up as women and dancing. The actors are all second- and third-rate roles. Of course, what is needed for such a comedy is just winking, grimacing, and playing juggling, and the expression masters will have no place to use their skills.

### Weather Clearing After the Rain

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Five: Spring Arrives at Bixiang, Fragrant Snow Sea; Flowers Fly at Tiger Hill, Moon Fills Li Lake

Zhu Ai'ren said, "Then even if you aren't a big Miss, you're still a little Miss." Wu Junsu said, "Isn't that so? In short, adornment is their biggest expense and their most focused education. Actually, even if they dress up well, they might not go out to play every day; sometimes they just stay at home, at most visiting with a few sisters. At that time, I had already entered primary school and was studying. I dared to say in my heart that after they dressed up like this, who were they showing it to? Were they showing it to themselves? Young women in Suzhou couldn't really make a splash; things like 'social butterflies' and other such titles only happened in Shanghai. But when the war started, Suzhou soon became an occupied area. Could families with land still expect to collect rent? Some fields were already desolate; even if they weren't, they couldn't expect to receive any rent. As for city houses, some were bombed, some were burned, some were forcibly occupied. The shops they opened, some closed, some were looted, some were robbed. What they had always relied on for income could now be said to be completely gone. At that time, Shanghai still had concessions, so they had no choice but to flee there. Those who couldn't escape in time had no choice but to suffer in the guerrilla areas. We had a paternal cousin uncle who used to be a 'freehand friend,' what you might call one of the 'young master' types, who would stroll along Guanqian Street after a full meal. Later, he was truly robbed bare and had no way to make a living, and his family was waiting to be fed, crying out. He thought of a plan: he got a few packs of cigarettes to sell, carrying a tray to the teahouses to drum up business. This was because it was relatively light work; if it were something heavy, my uncle, being a weak scholar, wouldn't be able to carry it. But since he came out of his mother's womb, how could he have ever done such a thing? When he saw acquaintances, he used a fan to cover his face, feeling extremely ashamed. It just so happened that he encountered someone who had worked as a minor errand boy in his house, who was now a clerk in the 'Maintenance Committee,' drinking tea in the teahouse. Seeing him, he said, 'Oh! Young Master is selling cigarettes? Give me a pack of Platinum Dragons.' This scared him so much that he picked up his tray and ran, almost tripping. As for the women, because the enemy soldiers had no discipline, they often violated women. So, they all ran to the countryside to live. Some who were used to wearing high-heeled leather shoes couldn't even wear flat shoes, complaining that their feet hurt. But in the countryside, high-heeled leather shoes were not good for walking, and you weren't allowed to be fashionable anymore. They had no choice but to wear the cotton-padded jacket of a country girl, wrap a headscarf, and wear blue cloth shoes on their feet. There were two red 'tugboats.' They imitated the attire of Jiangbei people, tying up the legs of their trousers and painting their faces completely black with the soot from the bottom of a pot, making them neither black nor white. Even dressed like this, they sometimes couldn't fool the enemy soldiers. Hiding and covering themselves up was extremely difficult." (55)

### The "Prosperity" After Yidingpan Road

— Xiren

Yidingpan Road, it is the only north-south road between Daxilu and Yuyuan Road within Ansi Temple. People from the Caojiadu area must pass through here to go to Xujiahui and other places; especially the people who work in the Caojiadu factory area and live in the Daxilu area, Yidingpan Road is even more their main road for getting in and out. Every day at dawn and dusk, it is the time when they alternate shifts, and the streets are filled with shadows of people coming and going.

I remember that in the second month after the 813 Incident, my footprints began to appear on Yidingpan Road. At that time, it was still a lightly made-up young girl, showing the demure personality that all young girls possess, without any strong atmosphere. Occasionally, one or two cars carrying beautiful young men and women sped past on the smooth asphalt road, making a whooshing sound, but otherwise, it can be said that there was not the slightest disturbance.

But now, it has taken off its plain makeup and put on a heavy makeup full of powder. Dazzling electric lights, flashing red lights, all the external features of a big city have been dressed up on this quiet road, creating its current "prosperity." The green grass on the left side of the houses has now been built with houses, ugly houses, and looking out the window, it is full of rows of black tiles, and the rural flavor of the past can no longer be appreciated.

But I have always had some doubts about his "prosperity": is it normal prosperity? Is it a deformed development?

The red light of the ** Company standing in the middle of the road flashes with despicable light, enticing people with wavering will to walk into their dens; to offer the hard-earned money earned from their own sweat and blood to the minions in those dens.

The fake "police" with yellow-brimmed hats and grass-green clothes are also a special embellishment here. They, the slave class without looting, have a wooden stick a foot long as their only weapon. Although they will take a few steps in the road, the scene is miserable enough, they dare not look people in the eye, and throwing the wooden stick around is their job, and guarding the door for gambling dens such as "clubs" is also one of the "specialized jobs".

Illusory prosperity is the true color of the deformed development of an isolated island city, but we do not need these, what we need is normal prosperity, but to build the foundation of normal prosperity, we must first drive away the demons that create illusory prosperity!

### About "School News"

— (Yimin)

In the "Reader's Column" on March 4th, Mr. Ci Kai published an article "Talking about School Publications," the content of which was quite brilliant, but there were some discrepancies regarding "School News," so I am adding a few points as a supplement below.

Regarding the "School News" published in Shanghai, it does bear a special mission, which was founded by Qian Yiming and Jiang Ting of the Huadong United Middle School Alumni Association and is entirely personal in nature, with no connection to Huadong United Middle School. As for the "School News" published in Hangzhou before, although the position of the publication was the same, the background was different. According to the publication at that time, the one published in Hangzhou was presided over by Yu Gangfu and Hua Feng, cadres of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department, and had a direct relationship with the China Youth Aspiration Association. At first, the publication was only a single sheet of four-page paper every week, but because the number of readers suddenly increased, it was changed to a sixteen-page booklet. The content of the material was more exciting than the recent publications in Shanghai. At that time, the number of copies sold in Hangzhou was about 1,000 or more, and those sold outside the port reached Ning, Qing, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hong Kong, Macau, and other places. The publication had already been registered by the Ministry of Propaganda and the Ministry of the Interior, and its title and font had been registered by the Ministry of Education, and others were not allowed to use it. It is said that the persons in charge of the "School News" in Shanghai also consulted with each other in advance. Regarding the reason for the suspension of the "School News" in Shanghai this time, it is said that it was temporarily suspended due to environmental reasons. According to reliable sources, it may be resumed soon, and it is said that the publication will not be issued alone this time. Every week, it will be temporarily published in the "Shanghai Ningbo Gazette," and it is already actively preparing for the resumption, which can be realized in about the next week.

### Idle Talk on Opera in the Wine Tavern (Part 1)

—

The state of the country is in turmoil, and the four suburbs are full of fortresses. Apart from sorrowful songs, is there still any interest in life? Occasionally listening to opera, my heart is touched, so I write it down, calling it "Idle Talk on Opera in the Wine Tavern."

One day, I watched Wu Dan Yan Shishan perform "The Bamboo Forest Story." Her beauty and skill were both superb. I heard that Shishan is the son of Jiuzhenfeng. If he is the son of Yan Jiu, then he should be the grandson of Zhu Wenying. Wenying is considered a senior among today's Wu Dan. In the industry, she is called Zhu Sishi, her qualifications second only to Yu Mao Bao, but her skill is comparable. Her son, Guifang, is also famous for his martial arts. Shishan has a handsome appearance, quite similar to Guifang. He Wuji is very similar to his maternal uncle. The Zhu and Yan families can be called a Wu Dan family, and Yan Jiu can be said to have a son. Yan Jiu back in the day, his martial arts were the best for a time, and he also sang Hua Dan, but he was too much, and he inevitably suffered from the criticism of seeking perfection. Shishan's martial arts, compared to his father, should be on par, and in terms of stability and graceful, it seems to surpass him. If he can transition from the "Riding the Horse, Stringing the Iron Bow" style of play to Guimen Dan, he can be expected to occupy a seat in the Dan roles. I hope Shishan will strive hard.

Later, there was Yang Shisen's "Pearl Curtain Village." Baosen is a descendant of Yu Shuyan. In the past few years, his voice and charm have been sufficient, but his strength is insufficient. The famous amateur Zheng Guoyi has a very deep friendship with Baosen and often worries about the state of Qi, not ashamed to ask questions and be foolish. I often wrote an article and published it in the newspaper, saying that Dousen's song is mellow and ancient, with the legacy of Huang Jing. When he is growing up, his middle qi is weak, so he cannot work hard, so there is less strength in his voice. If he waits until after the age of thirty, his physical strength will be full, and his tone will naturally be full. Time flies, and Baosen is now thirty. On this day, he performed "Pearl Curtain Village." From the appearance to the end, his sound and rhyme were clear and melodious, like a crane chirping in Jiugao, as full as the Yangtze River flowing through the Three Gorges. It can be called the ultimate in distinguishing turbidity, strength and softness. In recent times, well-known old students, those who pay attention to workmanship, mostly imitate clowns, taking the ability to nod and shake their heads, point to the sky and draw the ground as their ability, those who study singing mostly imitate Hua Shan, taking the ability to add words to let the board greasy slippery tune as their ability, and do not think from the perspective of the old student's identity. Baosen lives in today's world, does not cater to vulgarity and seeks accommodation, so that the song stage still retains the correct voice. I deeply admire his perseverance. However, there are two old versions of Li Keyong's sitting hurt poem: (1) "Taibai drinks a bucket of wine and writes a hundred poems, and the taverns in Chang'an sleep." This is Tan Xinpei's script. After Xinpei's death, the last two sentences were lost. Two famous amateurs in Peiping, Bao Dan Ting and Chen Moxiang, both knew it, but regarded it as an unpassed secret. Dan Ting once talked to Ping about it, and it has been twenty years, and I am old and forgetful, so I cannot remember it. (2) "Remembering the past when conquering Tumans, I killed the uncle of the state, Duan Wenchuyu, and the Tang King was angry and demoted him to the northern barbarians." Today's Jingjiao all read this poem. The two poems have a difference between elegance and vulgarity, and they cannot be mixed together. Shuyan did not teach this play in person. I don't know who cut and mixed these two poems, so that today it has become an order book. I deeply hope that Baosen will take Shuyan's strengths and work hard to make up for his shortcomings, so as to correct it, so as not to live up to this talent.

### Thoughts After Watching Three Historical Films

— Xitong

During the Lunar New Year, three historical films were released at the same time, namely: Hu Guang's "Mulan Joins the Army," Jin Cheng's "Meng Jiangnu," and Xin Guang's "Chu Overlord."

Among the three films, "Mulan Joins the Army" is the best. The screenwriter Ouyang Yuqian's technique is superb and novel, and the meaning is also ambiguous. The performers, Chen Yunshang, are graceful and vigorous, and they have done their best. These are the points that make "Mulan Joins the Army" stand out. Mulan's father, Shirong, dismantles the official document with Mulan's arrow, which is very natural and ingenious. When Mulan is about to leave, her parents both cry, but only her younger brother jumps for joy, which implies that the younger generation will be brave and diligent, and resist the enemy. The scene of Xu Qing under the moon is especially good, reminding people of a section in Liang Hongyu. However, using the moon to compare people, there is light but no moon, which is a bit flawed. When Mulan was discovered during the adventure, she failed to jump on the horse, and her skills seemed to be inferior to those of the Western film Brave.

In the eighth scene of "Meng Jiangnu," Songjiang City Gate, pedestrians had to bow to the guards before they were allowed to pass, which made people naturally think of the things before the limit. In the thirty-eighth scene, the old man presented a disturbance, saying that it was stolen, and the official actually accepted it, which also made people think that this was the truth. But later, the official returned the chicken to the old man, which seemed to interrupt the audience's association. I think the official should not pity the people, and after Meng Jiangnu sang, he should be ridiculed. The official should not be played by a clown at all, but should be played by Hong Jingling, etc. to be more meaningful; whether it is in line with the legend is not important

The dialogue of the Chu Overlord is simply a copy of "Historical Records," full of classical Chinese, which is not understandable by the general public, and feels a bit unnatural. Wang Yuanlong's Chu Overlord played very well, with no tears to cry at the end of the road, showing it particularly deeply. Secondly, I quite appreciate Han Xin (played by Chuan William), whose handsome aura is striking. Zhang Liang's costume should be more gorgeous and younger. The pork shoulder given to Fan Ha was too small. Finally, it is commendable to break away from the historical records, delete the two scenes of getting lost and persuading to cross, and commit suicide in the setting sun.

The war scenes of Chu Overlord are more serious and real than those of Mulan Joins the Army. The war between Shanjun and the evening is more like the real thing, because there is less open space on the screen, or it is more blurred. In the first few battles, there were only sparsely populated 20 or 30 people on a plain, like playing football, which was very childish. (Mulan Joins the Army is like playing volleyball, forming two straight lines.) If these scenes can reduce the open space and shoot closer, it will be more like the real thing.

### Li Qinian Sells Photos to Help Relief

— (Sent from Hong Kong)

Hong Kong red star Li Qinian, originally a famous flower in Macau, later joined the film industry, known for her performance of romantic and coquettish women, and her success is increasing day by day. Now she is the most famous actress in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, her personality is proud, which is not appreciated by those who know her. Most of the people in the film industry are not on good terms with her, and the minimum acting fee for each film is more than 1,000 yuan. It is difficult for ordinary small companies to reach her. Chen Yunshang's meteoric rise and rapid success is "bestowed" by Li Qinian's "pride." At the beginning of Li's departure from the life of selling laughter, she went to Shanghai to join the Lianhua Company, but was not admitted. Because she was impressed by the acting skills of the late actress Ruan Lingyu, she stayed in Shanghai to visit Ruan's performances at Lianhua and studied diligently, gaining quite a lot of Ruan Lingyu's acting skills. Therefore, Li has the nickname of Ruan Lingyu in the Southern Country in Hong Kong. Recently, Li specially took 250 photos taken over the years and held a personal photography exhibition at the Gloucester Hotel, charging a 2-cent admission fee for the public to visit, and marked the photos for sale. All the income will be used for charity to help refugees. Among the photos displayed, half-naked photos account for two-tenths, opera costumes account for one-tenth, swimming photos account for three-tenths, and other horse riding photos vary. Although this is in the name of "relief," publicity is the reality, but it is not too critical, so it has gained the sympathy of the general public.

### New Year's Trends of Famous Actors in the Old Capital (Part 2)

— Wang Lan

Li Wanchun has been performing in various theaters with the title of "Beijing School Monkey King" since he arranged and performed eighteen new plays. Recently, he performed his original play "Tongjiawu" in Qingle. He has performed five or six episodes of the God of Wealth day and night, and at the same time added "Tang Monk Conquers Wukong." (That is, Two Worlds Mountain, Shuangyou Ridge, Five Elements Out, Play Six Thieves, Snake Pan Mountain, Receive White Dragon)

Li Yanxiu is Shang Xiaoyun's proud student. Recently, a notice was published saying: "Respectfully inform you. Yanxiu performed in Qingle on the second day of the first lunar month (that is, February 20). She accidentally suffered from an epidemic and reluctantly took the stage, but she was unable to complete the performance and asked for leave. I am deeply grateful for the understanding of all gentlemen from all walks of life. When my humble illness is cured, I will do my best to contribute to express my gratitude and repay the elegant intentions of all gentlemen.

Ma Lianliang performed "The Heavenly Official Bestows Fortune" and "Ganlu Temple" in Xinxin on the God of Wealth Day, playing the Heavenly Official in "The Heavenly Official Bestows Fortune." In Ganlu Temple, he played Qiao Xuan and then Lu Su, Zhang Junqiu played the Cowherd in "The Heavenly Official Bestows Fortune," Sun Shangxiang in Ganlu Temple, Xiao Changhua played the God of Longevity in "The Heavenly Official Bestows Fortune," Qiao Fu in Ganlu Temple, Jiang Miaoxiang played Zhang Xian in "The Heavenly Official Bestows Fortune," and Lin Qiuwen played the Weaver Girl.

### Eccentric Wu Jilan

— Ma Xiuzhen

Ms. Wu Jilan, also known as Jie, is a native of Luoyang, Zhongzhou. She was originally a lady of the Li family, but later changed her surname to Wu. Born into a family of officials, she was intelligent from an early age, with a bold personality and no trace of femininity. She liked to wear men's clothing and was also good at poetry. She was known as an eccentric genius. She once studied at a university and taught for many years. She first played the role of Miss Pu Er as a guest singer, and later went to sea from the ticket, working as a Qingyi Zong Meipai. Wherever she went, she was praised. Now she travels far to the southwest and is highly regarded for a while. The above picture is the latest theatrical photo sent by Ms. Wu from Yunnan.

### Silver Report

Yihua invested heavily in the production of the film "Chu Overlord," which was screened at Xinguang during the Spring Festival, and the business was very prosperous. According to those who have seen the film, the scenes are indeed very grand and comparable to the Western film "The Fall of the Roman Empire."

The "Movie City Story," which has been promoted for a long time, has China's most popular actresses and famous Kunling and famous amateur actors as guest stars (including Sun Junxiang's Dingjun Mountain and Bao Youdie Zhang Zhesheng's Farewell My Concubine, with Bao Jun playing the qin, Dafeng's owner and Wang Ruoqi). It is said that Yihua plans to put this film in the theater that specializes in screening the first imported Western films to show seriousness.

Wen Yimin directed the film "Mysterious Madam," the whole play is sad and moving, the female lead is Lu Ming, Xu Qinfang, and Miss Wang Lian'gu, a famous female ticket player, made a special guest appearance, and has already started filming.

Wang Yuanlong will personally direct a film, titled "Swallow Li San," which depicts the righteous thief's robbery of the rich and helping the poor, which is very novel. Li San is played by Wang Yuanlong himself, and his younger brother Cilong will help, which is expected to be a gimmick.

### Secret History of the Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (123)

— Xu Muyun

The Secret Story of the Jingzhong Temple Being Occupied by Incense and Fire Taoists

Later, the old Taoist Jiao died, and Wang Shaolou improved day by day. The little Taoist He then took Shaolou as his godson. When Shaolou first came to Shanghai, because he had no acquaintances in the press, He also went south with him to take care of everything. When he was in Peiping, as long as there were weddings and funerals in the Lingjie, their master and apprentice always rushed to the front, posting news in the newspaper, and taking care of the affairs all day long, and the shares they gave were thicker than others, so they were still on good terms with the opera troupe. Seeing that the time was ripe, they first started by building the two stone tablets erected in the temple on the walls on both sides of the second gate. At first, the handwriting was still very clear, but in less than two years, they erased all the handwriting and the names of the people who created the temple. A few days later, the father built a new municipal house in front of the gate and opened a porcelain shop, completely covering up the temple gate of Jingzhong Temple. Over time, many people now don't know where the Jingzhong Temple in the old capital is. Although the temple is also equipped with electric lights and telephones, the telephone book shows the Qingyuande Porcelain Shop. The upper and lower floors of the main hall are all under lockdown all year round. Driven by curiosity, the day I visited the temple, taking advantage of the old Taoist's absence, I poked a hole in the white paper on the lattice door with my fingertip and looked inside. I saw many plaques piled on the ground. The most striking was a horizontal plaque with red bottom and gold characters. The writing under the payment was very large. All the names were famous figures of the Bangzi class, such as Guo Shichen, Tian Jiyun, and Hou Junshan, all of whom were listed on it. In the center of the main hall, there is still a shrine to the ancestors of the Pear Garden. On the walls on both floors, there are very fine murals. The ground is also piled with a lot of areas. These things are very heavy and not easy to destroy for a while, so they are temporarily preserved. If a few more years pass, after the Yao Township brothers and other three or four old Ling workers all die, the old Taoist will burn the shrine, murals, and plaques together, and the relics of the Jingzhong Temple will be completely submerged. The existing Ling people in the old capital do not know the intentions of their master and apprentice, but you are also embarrassed by your friendship, and I don't want to make trouble. Fortunately, this is the legacy left by the hard work and money of the predecessors, and it has nothing to do with yourself, so why offend people? Famous Ling people with money certainly don't want to get involved in the interests of the temple, and even a few who have some financial difficulties are always responsive when they find the incense and fire Taoists. In this way, the Jingzhong Temple, which has a dramatic history, was occupied by the Taoists who guarded the temple in an invisible way.
