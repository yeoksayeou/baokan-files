### Germany Augments Air and Ground Forces to Reinforce the Saar; No Progress on the Western Front; French Forces Adopt a Steady, Deliberate Strategy; Seizing Important Positions by Surprise

Beijing: Reports from the Rhineland state that the German commander is currently preparing to deal with the full-scale offensive of the British and French forces. Troops are massing en route. It is reported that multiple squadrons of the German Air Force have been transferred from the Polish front to the Western Front. (Reuters, 9th)

Paris: Germany is dispatching large reinforcements to the Saar region, hoping to prevent French forces from approaching the Siegfried Line. As a result, the fighting on the Western Front is intensifying today. According to reports received at 1:30 AM this morning (9:30 AM Shanghai time), French forces are now putting up a full-scale resistance. The fighting is particularly fierce in the mountainous terrain near Saarbrucken. This area is located above the Ur Valley, a thousand feet above the ground, with a dense forest and very dangerous terrain. French forces are determined to prevent the German forces from establishing a pontoon bridge on the Saar River. The French army will issue a statement at midnight, saying that the offensive situation is excellent. French forces have cleared German troops from 22 villages in the Warndt Forest and, under the cover of tanks, have advanced beyond several German minefields. These minefields are the vanguard of the Siegfried Line, only twelve miles away. According to French sources, the French Air Force has been extremely active on the Western Front in the past 24 hours. French reconnaissance planes, flying to the Siegfried Line to scout the movements of German troops, have been in communication with them. (Associated Press, 10th)

Paris: The Supreme Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 12 tonight, stating, "The enemy is putting up full-scale resistance and counterattacking in certain areas. One of our divisions, demonstrating ingenuity, has captured an important position. Enemy artillery fire is quite active. Our air force continued reconnaissance flights today, unaffected by the sorties of enemy fighter planes." (Havas, 9th)

Paris: The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 13 this morning, stating, "The enemy launched counterattacks in many areas on the front line yesterday. The overall situation has not changed as a result. Our aircraft continue to fly into enemy territory for reconnaissance." (Havas, 10th)

Paris: The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 10, which was brief. Semi-official sources explained it in accordance with yesterday's practice, saying that although the enemy launched a counterattack yesterday, our troops were able to firmly hold the positions they had already occupied and consolidate them overnight. At the same time, the communication lines to the rear were strengthened. As far as the war situation is concerned, the eastern and western fronts are completely different. On the Eastern Front, German forces are using their powerful motorized units to advance along the main transportation arteries of Poland, while the Polish army is launching flank attacks with cavalry. On the Western Front, both the French and British armies are mainly composed of infantry, supplemented by artillery, engineers, and other specialized units. In other words, our army is adopting a steady, deliberate, step-by-step approach. The battle lines are not very long. Whenever our army decides to occupy a position, it consolidates it, making it a rear base, which will also be the base for future offensives. This is in stark contrast to the German army's long-range, direct penetration on the Eastern Front. (Havas, 10th)

Paris: Semi-official investigations into the situation on the Western Front indicate that the fighting in the western region is still in the "approaching" phase and in a state of siege warfare. There is no question of a full military assault. Specialist units of the advance troops and engineering corps are currently engaged in clearing operations in the areas previously designated for the offensive. (Reuters, 9th)

Paris: The war bulletins issued here are concise, but a careful examination reveals the true situation on the Western Front, which is gradually becoming clear. Concrete bunkers along the Rhine River face each other across the bank, facilitating artillery battles. This section of the line, starting from Lauterbourg and ending in Luxembourg, is of utmost importance. The situation around the German Siegfried Line was previously unclear, but since the outbreak of the war, French aircraft have been conducting reconnaissance missions and taking photographs of various points on the German defense line. These photos have now been collected and compiled into detailed maps. In front of this line is a so-called "no man's land," ranging from three to six miles deep. The main focus of the French army is in this area. The French vanguard is now advancing into this area, clearing machine gun nests and outposts, in order to reach the Siegfried Line itself. This strategy allows the Maginot Line to "breathe" and maintains its secrecy with a sky defense as solid as an iron curtain, preventing it from being spied on by the Germans. At the same time, the great mobilization behind the Maginot Line is constantly underway. French forces are currently shelling the Siegfried Line to test its strength and find its weaknesses. Last night's war bulletin mentioned minefields and the destruction of their defensive structures, which is very clear. The minefields are a German defensive arrangement to destroy tanks, and the defensive structures include bridges and tunnels, such as the Saar River Bridge. According to reports from neutral sources, the residents of the Saarbrucken region have been evacuated. Due to this pressure, the movement of German troops to the Polish front has now slowed slightly. It can be seen that the Allied Staff's objective of pressuring the western front to alleviate the crisis on the eastern front is now gradually taking effect. (Reuters, 9th)

### Polish Army Resists Formidable Enemy; Intense Street Fighting in Warsaw; 32 German Tanks Destroyed; Lodz Occupied by German Forces Yesterday

Budapest: According to a broadcast from the Warsaw wireless station heard here at 11:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Polish defense forces in Warsaw have repelled repeated German attacks and prevented German troops from entering the city. Although the Germans have repeatedly claimed that the Warsaw city walls are actually in German hands, the Warsaw radio station claims that the Polish defense forces have prevented German troops from entering the city. Polish forces destroyed 32 German tanks. The German army temporarily ceased its attack at noon but continued the offensive in the afternoon. Polish civilians are bravely resisting the German offensive. Warsaw is still in Polish hands. The reporter claims that even the women and children in Warsaw are helping the defense forces dig trenches to resist the German army. (Associated Press, 10th)

Budapest: According to a wireless broadcast from Warsaw at 5:00 PM yesterday, Warsaw was still under Polish control at that time. The broadcast was providing guidance on air defense methods. (Reuters, 10th)

Warsaw: The Polish semi-official news agency PAT recently issued a message stating that German radio stations are using the same wavelength as the Warsaw radio station to broadcast false messages, falsely claiming that Warsaw has fallen. In reality, the Warsaw defense commander is continuing to strengthen the defenses. Although enemy planes are indiscriminately bombing, resulting in continuous deaths and injuries to innocent civilians, the residents of the entire city are very calm and are helping the authorities to build various fortifications. On the western outskirts, many trenches, kilometers in length, have been dug, preparing for a last-ditch defense. In addition, there have been no major changes in the fighting on various fronts today. The withdrawal of our troops from the front lines is in accordance with the planned procedure. (Havas, 9th)

Paris: According to fragmented reports received here, the fighting in Warsaw was still in the midst of street battles last night. Yesterday morning, a Polish radio announcer admitted that German troops had entered Warsaw. After a number of Polish troops in Warsaw surrendered to the Germans, direct communication between Poland and this area suddenly stopped at 3:15 AM. Sources in Budapest claim that the Warsaw radio station previously declared, "The Polish army intends to defend Warsaw to the last drop of blood." Military experts here claim that the vanguard of the German East Prussian army has reached the confluence of the Vistula and Bug rivers. One expert claims that "the Polish troops remaining on the right bank of the Vistula River face severe danger if they offer stubborn resistance." This is extremely obvious. (Associated Press, 10th)

Berlin: The German military headquarters issued a statement this morning, saying that the German army has exceeded its original plan and entered the last defense line of the Polish army. German troops have crossed the Bug River behind the San River, occupying Włodawa and Brześć. If this news is true, then the central Polish army will undoubtedly be completely forced to retreat. German troops entering Warsaw are clearing out the remaining Polish troops. German troops occupying Krośniewice and Kutno have advanced towards the Bzura River. There was fierce fighting near Łęczyca, with German troops attempting to cut off the Polish army's retreat route from the Vistula River. National Socialist Party sources said that the Polish army has suffered a major blow and that the final decisive battle in central Poland will take place on the banks of the Narew River northeast of Warsaw. A German spokesman said that the Polish troops in that area have long been subdued by German forces. The Polish troops east of the Narew River, San River, and Vistula River are completely devoid of strength. Regarding rumors that Hitler's goal is to restore the borders of the German Reich as they were in 1914, the spokesman said that this is a misunderstanding. The current area of activity of the German army has exceeded the old borders of 1914. (Associated Press, 10th)

London: Late last night, German radio broadcasts announced that, according to the German General Headquarters, German troops had entered Warsaw from the southwest. (Reuters, 10th)

London: Today, according to the official German news agency, German troops have occupied Łódź, located 82 miles southwest of Warsaw. However, Polish sources in London have not yet confirmed this news. Łódź is an important industrial city in Poland, with a normal population of 600,000. (Reuters, 10th)

Rome: Although Poland has lost one-third of its territory, and two to six divisions of the Polish army have been captured by German forces in the Poznań Province, Poland has just begun to fight. In neutral countries, I (this newspaper's special correspondent, Piatti, writing in the first person) have learned that the majority of the Polish army has not yet participated in the war. The Polish government has moved from Warsaw to the Nielisz summer resort near Lublin. Because their movements were discovered by German spies, they had to divide into six groups on the east bank of the Vistula River. After contacting the German army, they made a remarkably successful retreat through difficult terrain. They suffered heavy enemy bombing during their escape. The morale of the Polish soldiers is excellent. Polish civilians, however, have been misled by exaggerated news spread by the pro-Allied camp, such as believing that French troops have crossed the Rhine River, that the people of Mainz, Frankfurt, and Trier have all evacuated, and that they even imagined fifty French aircraft attacking Berlin and that "Berlin had long been bombed into a flat plain." German espionage in Poland has been very effective. Chancellor Hitler is using a large armored force and heavy artillery to attack Warsaw. This large army is only now making its first appearance on the Eastern European battlefield. (Associated Press, 10th)

### German War Report

Berlin: The semi-official German News Agency recently issued the following war report on the Eastern Front: (1) In the south, our army occupied the city of Łódź yesterday. The enemy is retreating eastward, and our army is pursuing the enemy in the mountains and the Vistula River valley. Our mechanized units have also been very successful between the cities of Tomaszów and Kutno. Several enemy divisions have been surrounded by our army. Although they are putting up a last-ditch resistance, their fate will be decided within a few days. (2) In the north, our army is advancing along both banks of the Vistula River and has reached the area west of the city of Płock and northeast of the city of Płock. Our army northeast of Warsaw has also advanced to the south bank of the Bug River. Both sides are engaged in fierce fighting near the city of Łomża. The highways and railways from Warsaw to the city of Vilnius and to the southeast have been destroyed by our air force. Our planes flew to Lublin, the city in eastern Poland (where the Polish government is rumored to have moved), to launch an attack. They engaged in aerial combat with enemy planes, immediately shooting down seven enemy planes and destroying eight enemy planes. (Havas, 10th)

### Three More British Ships Sunk; Crews Rescued

London: The Ministry of Information recently issued a bulletin stating that two more British transport ships have been sunk by submarines: the "Garthpool" (5,548 tons), all crew members jumped into lifeboats and were rescued, and the " Winkleigh", all crew members were rescued by the Dutch tugboat "Staten-dijk". In addition, the British mail ship "Walmer Castle" (20,000 tons) and the cargo ship "Chloris" were pursued by German submarines but managed to escape. (Havas, 10th)

London: The British cargo ship "Goodwood" has been sunk by a torpedo in the North Sea. All twenty-one sailors were rescued by a fishing boat and sent to the British coast. The ship's owner has broken his leg, and several sailors have also been injured. (Havas, 10th)

Moscow: In order to protect merchant ships from being attacked by warships of belligerent nations, the government has recently issued an order requiring all merchant ships to paint a national flag on both sides of the hull, with the words "Soviet Federation" attached below. At the same time, three lights should be added to the masthead to distinguish them, the top and bottom lights being green and the middle one red. In addition, all merchant ships that encounter warships or aircraft of belligerent nations at night should send a Morse code signal with lights on the deck, declaring their nationality. Any merchant ship that does not fully comply with these measures will not be allowed to sail abroad. (Havas, 10th)

### British and French Navies Continue Operations; German Merchant Ships Vanish from the High Seas; Overseas Military Supply Sources Cut Off; German Navy Claims to Abide by International Law

London: The Ministry of Information reports on the continued activities of the British and French navies, stating that German merchant ships have now vanished from the high seas, while British Empire maritime communications continue to be maintained and have not been seriously disrupted. Several German merchant ships have been captured by British warships. Some German merchant ship crews have first scuttled their ships and then abandoned them. Such cases have occurred more than once. At the outbreak of the war, most of the German ships at sea or in neutral ports are now sheltering in neutral ports. Some are sheltering in Vigo, Spain, and various Japanese ports, while others are sheltering in North and South America, Iceland, and other ports. The use of merchant ships as auxiliary armed vessels to launch attacks is also forbidden, as are other tasks during wartime. Except through the Baltic Sea, Germany's overseas military supplies have now been completely cut off. (Reuters, 9th)

Berlin: Regarding the official British Ministry of Information statement that the German government has instructed submarines to indiscriminately bomb merchant ships, the German Naval Headquarters yesterday issued the following statement: (1) When the "Athenia" incident occurred, the German Navy had notified all fleets to strictly abide by the provisions of the international conventions on maritime warfare. (2) This order remains in effect. The interview with the captain of the American transport ship "Washington" demonstrates the German Navy's compliance with the order. (3) Germany believes that the purpose of the British Ministry of Information in publishing the above report is solely to incite neutral countries to hate Germany. (Haito News Agency, 10th)

Berlin: Details of the attempt by a British warship and a bomber to detain the German ship "Flangern" have been released. It is reported that the "Flangern" was warned by a British warship and a British plane at 8:30 AM on September 6 to stop advancing. At the time, the ship was less than 800 meters off the coast of Batu Harbor on the west coast of Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies. The ship ignored the warning and continued to advance. The British plane dropped four bombs. The dropping of bombs by the British plane in Dutch territorial waters has violated Dutch neutrality. (Haito News Agency, 10th)

Lisbon: According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the British cargo ship "Manar" was torpedoed by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean on September 7, without receiving any warning. Most of the crew members were rescued after great difficulty. According to the "Manar" crew members who landed in Lisbon, the ship was equipped with several 4-inch cannons. When the ship was intercepted by the German submarine, the ship immediately opened fire. (Haito News Agency, 10th)

### German Siegfried Line in the West

New York: The famous American commentator, Foster, recently published an article in the "New York World-Telegram" commenting on the Allied claims of breaking through the German Siegfried Line, adopting a rather satirical tone. The article stated, "The Siegfried Line built by Germany is unprecedented in its scale of construction. The line has not been breached by French forces, and the construction of the line is layered, with fortresses, machine gun nets, artillery batteries, tanks, and traps, all of which are equipped, and cannot be broken in one fell swoop." (Haito News Agency, 10th)

### Battlefield Losses; German Casualties

Beijing: Polish sources indicate that, to date, German casualties must already be in the tens of thousands. (Reuters, 9th)

Berlin: A bulletin was released here last night detailing German losses in Poland, stating that although German forces have been engaged in intense fighting in various places in Poland, the losses are not significant. According to senior commanders, from September 4 to 6, the German army suffered four deaths and seventeen injuries per ten thousand men. If the six days since the outbreak of the war are added to the calculation, then the number is five deaths and forty injuries per ten thousand men. It is claimed that this figure is the average number for all units participating in the Eastern Front. The units participating in intense battles have suffered greater losses than other units. (Haito News Agency, 10th)

### Soviet Union Mobilizes Reserves; Moscow Displays Wartime Atmosphere; Rumors of Secret German-Soviet Pact to Partition Poland

Paris: According to reports from London yesterday, it is said that the Soviet Union and Germany have signed a secret pact to divide Poland according to the borders of 1914. (Associated Press, 10th)

Moscow: Due to the increasing expansion and tension of the German-Polish war, the Soviet government has recently ordered the partial conscription of reserves from certain age groups in order to strengthen national defense. The military districts that have already begun conscription include Ukraine, Belarus, Leningrad, Moscow, Kalinin, and Orel. (TASS, 10th)

London: A Soviet spokesman told the Associated Press here last night that the Russian mobilization is purely a precautionary measure and is not directed at Poland. However, the Polish government is still extremely suspicious of this, believing that a Soviet-German military agreement has been finalized recently. (Associated Press, 10th)

Moscow: Yesterday, many officers at the Kursk Military School were officially promoted to the rank of lieutenant. Many officers at the Kiev Military School were also promoted. (Haito News Agency, 10th)

Moscow: According to reports received here from various sources, the Soviet Union has been mobilizing reserves from multiple age groups since yesterday, including those who completed their military service five or even ten years ago. All those called up are to report immediately to designated assembly points. The destination of their organized departure has not been announced. It is believed that it is definitely not simply for exercises and autumn drills and must be related to strengthening the defense of the western border. (Haito News Agency, 10th)

Moscow: The conscription of reserves in various places is continuing smoothly and in an orderly manner. The situation in Moscow is unprecedented in recent years. Young men are going to designated locations in the early morning. The number of people receiving conscription notices is very large. Barracks and other military institutions are full, and troops have also been stationed in various schools. In addition to their passports, reserves who are required to enlist must bring several days' worth of food, underwear, and other items. Employers are prepaying reservists two weeks' worth of salary and wages. There is a lively atmosphere at the various stations. Reservists are arriving in Moscow from various places and have begun to be dispatched to the western front. Ticket sales to Minsk, Smolensk, and other places have been suspended. Purchasers must present military identification. Most of the reservists are between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-two. Military technical personnel and other experts are older. The public mood is very calm. (Haito News Agency, 10th)

Editorial

### Britain Begins "Resisting Aggression"

At the end of August, this newspaper, based on a Reuters dispatch from London, reported that British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had assured Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, that even if the European situation underwent drastic changes, Britain's Far Eastern policy would not change. Now, Germany has opened fire on Poland, and Britain and France have declared war on Germany. The foul, cowardly, ambiguous, and sinister atmosphere of peace that once enveloped Europe and misled humanity has now dissipated like smoke. The continuous artillery fire has become the dawn of day, and the bloodshed has irrigated the gardens of civilization. The complacent dreams have been shattered, and Europe has undergone dramatic changes. At this juncture, it is also known that Ambassador Guo and the British Foreign Secretary exchanged views again on the 8th of this month, agreeing that it would be beneficial for China and Britain to share interests and jointly resist aggression. The British Foreign Secretary further stated that Britain's Far Eastern policy remains unchanged and reaffirmed that China's independence and prosperity are of great importance to British interests and world peace. China has endured immense suffering and gained worldly wisdom over the past few years. It is accustomed to hearing all sorts of words and will not feel flattered by Halifax's statement. However, China has also gained experience through hardship. This year's "September 3rd" for Britain is akin to China's "July 7th" incident two years ago. Before Britain declared war on Germany on September 3rd of this year, it endured humiliation and sought complete accommodation. Its Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax were ridiculed and scorned by public opinion. How is this different from China before the full-scale war of resistance after the July 7th incident? When it became unbearable and they resolutely went to war, there were no distractions, no diversions, the path was clear, and the spirit was pure, moving forward without hesitation and without looking back. This state of spiritual ease and righteousness cannot be understood by Britain after "September 3rd" unless it has experienced China after "July 7th." Nor can it be understood without experiencing hardship. Without mutual understanding, there can be no agreement. Therefore, we can imagine that what the British Foreign Secretary said to Ambassador Guo was a sincere and candid exchange of views, not comparable to the usual superficial diplomatic rhetoric.

Aggression is the exposure of humanity's barbaric instincts. War is an act that transcends human reason. The actions of civilized humanity must diligently seek reason as a guide, and always regard war as evil. Cruel and irrational, the impact of war is bound to be cruel. However, the evil of aggression is greater than that of war. Twenty-one years have passed since the end of World War I, and the scars have not yet fully healed. The impression of cruelty is still deeply engraved in the eyes and hearts of those who value reason. Therefore, Chamberlain and his ilk, although witnessing the barbaric instincts displayed by some humans, had their reason, which should have prevented self-immolation, obscured by the cruel impression, and they harbored a侥幸hope that disaster would not befall them. Did he not say to his countrymen half a year ago, "I do not wish to see the cruelty of war again in my lifetime!" Who knew that barbaric instincts have the function of suggestion, contagion, and spread, and soon spread from the Far East to the European continent, eventually prompting Chamberlain to awaken a deeper reason and be forced to declare war. Rejecting Stimson's proposal, abandoning the sanctions of the League of Nations, and sacrificing Czechoslovakia to satisfy the appetites of the greedy were, at the time, considered normal and rational ways to benefit Britain, avoid other people's problems, and stay away from right and wrong. Who knew that barbaric instincts could never be healed by normal reason? It is only by liberating the war obscured by reason that one can hope to contain it. For evil lies only in aggression, war is not evil, and resisting aggression, without fearing war, is the ultimate in benevolence, righteousness, courage, and wisdom.

Moreover, human habits develop in many directions, tending toward good if they encourage goodness and toward evil if they reward evil. Generally, reason has reached a considerable level, and the difference between civilization and barbarity is not as vast as heaven and earth. Those who expose their barbaric instincts do so partly out of their own will and partly because of the indulgence of the environment, and they do not necessarily maintain those instincts forever. This is an old adage, but the British declaration of war on Germany today has revealed a phenomenon below common sense. Have you not heard the news from neutral countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands after the declaration of war? The German authorities did not expect that Britain would be determined to fulfill its obligations to help Poland, even to the point of declaring war. Have you not heard General Goering's speech to the workers yesterday, six days after the start of the war? He attacked Britain, still hoping that British Prime Minister Chamberlain would choose between peace and war. It is evident that the German authorities still do not deeply believe in Britain's determination to resist aggression. Alas, are the German authorities so foolish and ignorant? Observing the events of the past five years, the international community has indulged aggression and rewarded aggression, never punishing evil and encouraging good. It is no wonder that the habits of its people have developed in the direction of barbarity. The international community should not tolerate aggression, but in recent years, its indulgence and reward have been close to trapping people in injustice. Now that Britain has raised the banner of resisting aggression, it realizes that China's rise is of like mind and shared path, which has not been seen in recent years. Germany, having received this head-on blow, will ultimately have no chance of survival. Will those who are displaying their barbaric instincts also restore their reason, change their ways, and realize their mistakes? To say that it will not be too late to change before the end is to underestimate the difference between human wisdom and foolishness. To say that punishing one is not enough to deter a hundred is to underestimate the boundlessness of human catastrophe.

### The British Government Instructs All Departments to Prepare for a Three-Year War Plan, Determined Not to Stop Until Hitlerism is Overthrown, Determined Not to Be Swayed by Peace Propaganda

London - The Ministry of Information announced that the wartime cabinet will meet this morning to decide on policies based on the assumption that the war will last three years or more. Instructions are being issued to various administrative departments to immediately begin preparing future plans based on this assumption. Various plans that have already been prepared must now be actively implemented. The expansion of national defense plans is already underway. The Ministry of Munitions will immediately take necessary steps to massively increase the capacity to manufacture various munitions to meet various situations. The Navy and Air Force are making appropriate arrangements. The maintenance of domestic needs and export trade is also being considered for the sake of national interests. The wartime cabinet believes that this important decision will receive the unanimous support of the people and the welcome of allied and friendly nations. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the most important thing is not the government's policy of basing itself on a three-year war, but Britain's determination to break Hitlerism and persevere to the end. (Reuters, 10th)

London - Diplomatic circles here recently said that once Germany has a sufficient advantage within Poland's borders, it will propose "peace proposals." At that time, it will definitely seek the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to serve as an intermediary. However, British officials said that these proposals are not worth considering. The British government has decided to unite with its allies and continue the war until National Socialism is overthrown. At this time, the Polish army is still able to resist for a long time. In addition, the Anglo-French offensive on the Western Front will definitely have a restraining effect and greatly benefit Poland's war of resistance. (Havas, 9th)

### The Outbreak of the European War Was a Miscalculation by Hitler, According to Japanese Prime Minister Abe; Parisian Newspapers Agree

Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Abe told reporters today that the outbreak of the European war was due to Hitler's miscalculation and solemnly declared that Japan would not be drawn into the vortex. Japan's diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain may need to be readjusted in the future. However, some people think that the European war will give Japan an opportunity to easily resolve the China issue, which is a serious mistake. (Reuters, 10th)

Tokyo - Former member of the Military Council, Admiral Nakamura, said today that Hitler is a "landlubber" who ignored the decisive power of the British and French navies and did not give them full consideration. The current situation is more unfavorable to Germany than in 1914. Even if Warsaw is occupied by German troops and Italy mediates, it is impossible for Britain and France to give Germany what it needs. (Reuters, 9th)

Paris - The "Strong Will" newspaper criticized Germany's blitzkrieg strategy and the Anglo-French strategy of delaying the war to win a complete victory, saying that according to various observations, Hitler seems to say to himself, "I will quickly defeat Poland and then negotiate peace." But Hitler is wrong, as can be seen from British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration in the House of Commons. (9th)

### Dutch Newspapers Comment on the War Situation; The Deeper the German Army Advances, the More Difficult It Will Be

The Hague - Newspapers here recently commented on the European war. The "People's Daily" stated that once Poland's front line is greatly shortened, the German army will come into contact with the main force of the Polish army, and will no longer be able to drive straight in. Moreover, Romania is still continuing to supply Poland, which will facilitate future resistance. Not only that, the eastern part of Poland is rugged and has no good roads. The deeper the German army advances, the more difficult it will be. It will be even worse once the autumn rains begin. The "Xiong Bao" newspaper stated that Germany now hopes to defeat Poland and then conduct peace talks with Britain and France. "If Britain and France refuse, Germany will have no worries in the east and can concentrate its troops on the western border. If the Allied forces are still defeated, plus Hitler's goal in attacking Poland is not something the Soviet Union seems interested in, it can be seen that there is no secret agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union on the Polish issue. According to this, Germany still needs a large number of troops on the eastern front to maintain its position. Even if the German army controls the entire territory of Poland, it will be of great military significance, but the current general situation may not change much." (Havas, 9th)

### American Red Cross Donates $50,000 to Help the Polish Red Cross

Washington - The American Red Cross has decided to allocate $50,000 to purchase medicines and tents to donate to the Polish Red Cross. (Havas, 10th)

New York - The Shipping Association of New York announced that all freight charges for goods shipped from New York and other ports on the Atlantic Ocean to ports in the Far East will be increased by 20%. (Havas, 10th)

### Lloyd George's Speech: Britain Fights for Justice

London - Former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George recently wrote an article entitled "Britain Fights for Justice," stating, "Once again we are fighting for international justice. Our goal is to have others recognize that all nations, regardless of strength or weakness, have equal rights. If all nations can refrain from interfering in the affairs of their neighbors, then they can all live independently in peace. The major powers of Western Europe gave an aggressor a lesson in 1914. Today, they must give this country the same lesson again. It is hoped that this will be the last time. We are fighting for the interests of humanity and the future of civilization. However, the burden may be greater than in 1914. If we fail, the harm may be more severe than in 1918. This must be understood." As for Poland's war of resistance, the country's defensive power depends on three factors: (1) the ability of the country's commander; (2) whether the country's army has built solid positions as strongholds for resistance; and (3) the morale of the country's army. With regard to the first item, the battle of Westerplatte has proved the resistance of the Polish people and cannot be taken lightly. With regard to the third item, the country's army has shown no signs of weakness so far, which is commendable. If the Polish army can use strong fortifications to stop the German advance in the future, then the war situation may be changed. In addition, with the activities of the French army, it will not be difficult to succeed in one fell swoop, because the French army is so well-trained that no country can match it. (Havas, 9th)

London - Former Labor government Foreign Secretary Dalton said in a speech in Warkland today that this battle is to defend civilization against Hitlerism. From the perspective of historical victory, Britain and its allies may have been defeated many times in the war, but they always won in the end. We are still in the early stages, and Britain's air force has already achieved great results in preemptive strikes, hitting German battleships with several heavy bombs and sending hundreds of copies of real leaflets to the German people. We are still in the early stages, but the people should undergo a heroic test, and its victorious conclusion will belong to us. (Reuters, 9th)

### Canada Declares War on Germany

Ottawa - The Federal Government held a meeting late yesterday to draft a declaration of war against Germany. Governor General Lord Tweedsmuir is expected to sign it at 8:00 AM local time today. (Havas, 8th)

Ottawa - Canadian Governor General Lord Tweedsmuir read King George VI's edict to a joint session of the Senate and House of Commons yesterday, urging the Canadian Federation to cooperate in the fight against aggression. Prime Minister Mackenzie King then gave a speech, emphasizing that the Canadian Federation should cooperate closely with Britain. The Senate and House of Commons also passed memorials today, expressing their approval. In other words, it is recognized that the Canadian Federation and Germany are already at war. In this way, Canada's declaration of war against Germany will soon become a reality. Moreover, during the discussion of war matters in the Senate and House of Commons, the vast majority of members supported the government. Minister of Justice Lapointe gave a speech in the House of Commons late in the evening, stating that Canada maintains a constitutional connection with Britain and has no possibility of remaining neutral. "If our freedom and democracy are threatened, the Canadian Federation has no other option but to participate in the war." A senator declared in the Senate that if we do not stop the progress of National Socialism on the Vistula River in time, we may have to stop it on the St. Lawrence River in the future.

General attention is focused on Britain's attitude towards Japan. In addition to striving to promote diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, China believes that the importance of the United States in the Far East has suddenly increased after the outbreak of the European war, and therefore also hopes to obtain further assistance from the United States. (Haitong News Agency, 10th dispatch)

Chongqing - Chinese newspapers here all printed British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's assurance that Britain's China policy would not be affected by the European war in large type.

The independent Xinmin Daily published a commentary on this matter this morning, stating that the British Foreign Secretary's guarantee has shattered Japan's hope of forcing Britain to cooperate with its aggression in China. Britain's "seemingly weak attitude" in the Far East is entirely due to pressure from Europe and is not Britain's willingness to compromise with Japan. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)

### Initial Fishing Season in the Chaoshan Area Under Japanese Military Invasion. Yellow Croaker Schools Have Arrived with the East Wind and White Waves. Fishermen Have Some Gains but Difficulty Transporting and Selling.

Shantou Correspondence – Since the Japanese military invasion of China, fishermen along the Chaoshan coast have suffered heavy losses. More than eight thousand fishing boats and salt boats in Nan'ao, Raoping, Zhao'an, Tongshan, Chenghai, Chaoyang, Huilai, Lufeng, Haifeng, and other counties have been sunk or burned by Japanese warships. More than thirty thousand fishermen have died or lost their entire families at sea. At least one million people who rely on fishing for a living are suffering from hunger and disease. Even after the fall of Shantou, the Japanese army, with a small number of troops, penetrated deep into Chao'an and fought fiercely with the Chinese army along the Chaoshan Railway. Although they no longer have the strength to take care of the coastal area, there are still one or two warships anchored in Shantou port, dispatching speedboats to operate on the sea, causing most fishermen to still not dare to go out to sea to make a living. However, the climate in Chaoshan is such that every year after the seventh month of the lunar calendar marks the beginning of the fishing season. The east wind and white waves come from afar, bit by bit, towards the coast, bringing with them marine products such as yellow croaker, pomfret, and thin-shelled clams. According to old seafarers, the seafood brought by the east wind to eastern Guangdong in recent days indicates that this autumn's fishing season will definitely be bountiful. He pointed to the moving clouds and said that the first wave of yellow croaker schools has arrived within ten miles of the coast. Pomfret, cuttlefish, and squid are also continuing to move towards Nan'ao and Chaoyang in large numbers. Unfortunately, the large trawlers have been almost completely destroyed by enemy warship artillery fire, making it impossible to trawl for these fish. Fortunately, from mid-August, most of the Japanese warships on the Fujian-Guangdong sea area were transferred elsewhere, so fishermen quietly sailed out to sea to fish. They used three-zhang-long shrimp boats instead of trawlers, tentatively setting out from Haimen and Dahao to cast their nets. They fished mostly within three miles of the shore and, as expected, it was particularly abundant. Because large-scale encirclement and netting had been impossible for the past two years, the fish considered this bay to be their only haven, so every time the fishermen went out to sea, they returned fully loaded. Unfortunately, transportation to various places was cut off at this time, making it impossible to transport and sell the fish. In the Dahao area, one yuan could buy only four catties of rice, and each person could only buy one catty per day. Fresh fish could be bought for ten to fifteen catties per yuan. Therefore, everyone was willing to eat fish instead of rice. The fishermen dried fish like flounder, yellow croaker, squid, black fish, and prawns, using small sailboats to transport them to Hong Kong in exchange for matches, kerosene, and daily necessities. Since Dahao had become an occupied area, with no Japanese troops stationed in the town and no customs officials from the Chinese government, it became the freest trading port, specializing in the transport of seafood to Hong Kong. There were fifty or sixty small sailboats, as small as bamboo leaves, less than two zhang long, drifting back and forth in the big waves, dedicated to transporting and selling this seafood. According to sailors, when Japanese warships encountered fishing boats, they only asked for some fresh fish, sometimes giving some rice or sugar in exchange. Another day, they gave out propaganda from the Peace and National Salvation Army, ordering the fishermen to take it to the people on the shore to read. Tongshan Island in Zhao'an, Fujian, was occupied by four Japanese warships firing artillery on August 22nd. The island's self-defense forces bravely fought back, but were eventually outnumbered and hid in the rocky caves on the top of the mountain. The island is a salt-producing area, and all the stored salt, estimated at more than five thousand tons, was looted. Furthermore, two hundred carrying boats were seized, and the entire island's people were required to provide joint guarantees of five households, and to hand over the self-defense forces on the mountain, before they would be allowed to freely dry salt and fish. Nan'ao's coastal area also suffered the same blockade. The fishing season has arrived, but not a single fishing boat has been seen sailing out from Nan'ao. The remaining people in the county have been unable to communicate with Raoping and Chenghai. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese army in Nan'ao dispatched eight speedboats to intercept ships at the ports of Haishan Island, Jingzhou, Zhuizao, Waisha, Nanbei Harbor in Raoping. In addition, two warships fired artillery to provide cover. Many coastal village houses and fishing boats preparing to go to sea were destroyed and sunk. Furthermore, sixteen Japanese boats from Haishan Island invaded the vicinity of Tuolin, Huanggang, and Jingjin. At noon, the tide receded and the water dried up, making it impossible to sail out. The Chinese soldiers used skateboards to slide through the mud and attack, sinking several Japanese speedboats and killing fifty to sixty Japanese soldiers. Everything on board was seized by the Chinese. At 5 p.m., the tide rose again, and the Japanese warships approached Tuolin again, firing more than thirty shells at Huanggang, reducing nearby fishing villages to rubble, but dared not charge ashore.

With the arrival of this year's fishing season, fishermen along the Guangdong coast can only sigh at the sea. Dongshan and Nan'ao, which have been occupied, have been blockaded. In other places, they are wantonly ravaged by Japanese troops when they are defeated. Chaoyang Dahao, because the Chinese army abandoned it, and the Japanese troops have no strength to defend it, use gentle means to only appease the fishermen, not because the Japanese side has any love for Dahao.

### Chinese Troops in Rugao Capture Three Japanese Soldiers

Rugao Correspondence – Xinsheng Port is the end point of the Rugao-Xinpu Highway and an important port in Rugao County. The Japanese side has stationed heavy troops there, and nearby villages are often plundered. At the end of last month, the Chinese army learned that He Gaoshan of Xinsheng Township (about ten miles from Xinsheng Port) was being used by the Japanese army, so they went to arrest him. After completing the mission and returning to their original defenses, they encountered three Japanese soldiers on the way. The Chinese army immediately used box cannons to shoot, and the three Japanese immediately surrendered and were bound. They were escorted to the higher authorities for disposition.

### Goering's Speech Alienates Britain and France, Coerces Peace, Says Polish Military Can Be Resolved in Four Weeks, Then Asks Chamberlain to Reply to Demands for War and Peace

Berlin – Air Minister and Prussian Governor-General Hermann Goering delivered a speech at noon today to workers at the Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken (German Weapons and Munitions Factories), the largest armaments factory in Germany, near Berlin. He first described the events that caused the war among the European countries, and then said that Germany had two lines of defense: the first line was soldiers, and the second line was workers. He praised the munitions workers, and when he mentioned the current war, Goering strongly criticized Britain, saying: "The reason why Poland dares to blatantly reject the Führer's generous proposals is entirely due to the protection of the British Empire. We acknowledge British interests on five continents and have never interfered in British politics, but whenever our country takes measures to protect its legitimate interests, Britain must come out to interfere and obstruct it. If Britain wants to avoid a large-scale conflict, it only needs to exert effective pressure on Poland to make it accept Germany's moderate proposals. It is nothing but deception to claim that it wants to resolve serious issues through negotiations. In recent days, British and European politicians have claimed that they are not at war with Germany, but with Hitler's Nazi government. However, when they fire their guns, they are firing at the German people. Britain also flaunts morality, claiming that its decision to participate in the war is to protect small countries, but in fact, according to history, the British Empire is the country that has annexed the most small and weak nations in the world. The reason why it has become such a great power is entirely due to this method. Therefore, morality is also a deception."

Goering continued: "Britain is challenging Germany in three ways: (1) Military, (2) Economic, (3) Domestic. In the military aspect, Germany is facing Britain, France, and Poland alone, but Germany's western fortifications are as solid as soup, and its coastal defenses are impenetrable. The Polish war is expected to destroy the main force within a week, and clear the remnants in another two weeks, for a total of one month. Then, seventy divisions of troops will be withdrawn from the east and sent to the west, so the position of the German army will definitely not be inferior. Moreover, with the German-Soviet pact, Germany will never be attacked from the rear and can concentrate on dealing with the western front. Britain should also be aware of this. Today, British planes only come to Germany to distribute leaflets. If they replace leaflets with bombs, Germany will take the same action. Therefore, Britain's military challenge to Germany will definitely not succeed.

Secondly, in the economic aspect, I dare to declare publicly that our country is the country with the most soundly organized institutions in the world. Even in terms of the armaments production system, Germany can be said to be unparalleled in the world. Today, the only thing we care about is work, nothing else. Although other countries have more gold, copper, tin, and zinc, Germany has the most capable and willing workers. The achievements in the past have been excellent, and we must work even harder in the future. Although Germany is said to lack raw materials, it still has a surplus of the two most important materials, coal and iron. Moreover, in addition to imposing certain restrictions on some raw materials, Germany has invented some substitutes that are more convenient and easier to use than British raw materials, which must be forcibly transported from distant colonies to the islands. Therefore, no matter how long this war lasts, the German economic organization will definitely not be affected."

Goering then discussed the issue of blockade, pointing out that Germany's blockade today is completely different from that during World War I. At that time, Britain blockaded the west, Russia blockaded the east, and some small countries blockaded the southeast. Today, because of the neutrality of the various small and medium-sized countries, the only area that is blockaded is from Denmark to Basel. Since Germany and the Soviet Union have decided to unite, they will never sacrifice themselves for Britain and kill each other. Both the Soviet Union and Poland have sufficient raw materials to supply Germany. The small countries in Southeastern Europe must carefully consider whether to participate in Britain's encirclement plan. If there is instability, Germany will take swift and decisive action to stabilize it. During World War I, the German front was as long as 3,800 kilometers, but this western continuous front is only 250 kilometers.

Goering then clarified that Germany has no demands on France. He is not worried even if the United States joins the blockade of Germany, because trade between the two countries has been very sluggish in recent years. The cessation of American goods will not have a major impact.

Referring to the various atrocities in Poland, Goering asked British Prime Minister Chamberlain: "If Mr. Chamberlain still regards the Polish nation as a valuable nation, then it is also a shame on morality. Thirty-one German pilots were forced to land, and they were all assassinated by Polish people. What do you think, Your Excellency? I would very much like to hear your reply in a future parliamentary speech."

Goering finally declared: "This declaration of war was made by Chamberlain, not by Führer Hitler. Germany has no demands on France and is willing to seek peace at any time with countries that do not oppress Germany and do not persecute Germans. But at the same time, it is also making all preparations to fight to the end if necessary. Germany's desire for peace is definitely not a sign of weakness. The key to war and peace lies in the hands of the other party. The German side can only do its best to negotiate. What must be solemnly declared is that there is an inseparable bond between the German people and the Führer. The Führer is Germany, and Germany is Hitler." (October 9th, Hai Tong News Agency)

Zurich, Switzerland – German Air Minister Hermann Goering delivered a speech today to workers at a munitions factory in Berlin, saying in brief: "The British side extravagantly claims that its planes bombed our naval base on the 4th of this month, and that a warship was hit by a bomb. In fact, what landed on the deck of the ship was not a British bomb, but a British pilot, because the plane he was flying had been shot down. In addition, British planes have scattered leaflets over Germany. If these leaflets were replaced with bombs, Germany would immediately retaliate. Looking at the war record in the eight days since the war began, our army has captured vast territories in Poland on the eastern front, and the Polish capital has been surrounded. The remnants of the Polish army have been surrounded and have no way to escape. The mopping-up work is about to end. As for France, we have nothing to ask of the French. Poland has guaranteed the French border, but if the French still want to fight with the British, that is their business, and we cannot dissuade them. However, we have no need on the French side, nor do we have any reason to attack that country. This fact cannot be denied. Our country has enough food, but to be prepared, you should still reduce your food intake and develop habits, and you can also lose some weight. We really need this. The frequent air raid alerts are too frequent. The reason is that those responsible for sounding the alarm are too flustered. But our country has not yet been threatened by enemy planes, which I can tell you." The government authorities have prohibited the people from listening to foreign radio broadcasts, not to hide the facts and prevent the people from knowing them, but because listening to foreign lies is contrary to honor. "If we are not united, we cannot win. Foreign propaganda is trying to seduce the German people, but as long as Führer Hitler lives, this propaganda will not be effective." Goering then touched on France, saying, "We Germans do not want to slaughter the French people, nor do we want to conquer land in France and Britain, but Britain is the only country that desires war, and wants France to fight to the last man. If Prime Minister Chamberlain forces us to fight, the intensity of the struggle will be unprecedented. The crossroads of war and peace are before you, and only Mr. Chamberlain can choose it."

### British Air Force Violates Neutrality, Belgian Planes Take Off to Intercept, One British Plane Forced to Land, Britain Apologizes to the Belgian Government to Settle the Matter

London – According to officials here today, after the British Air Force flew over German airspace last night for reconnaissance, they mistakenly passed over Belgian territory, resulting in a conflict with Belgian fighter planes. British aircraft pilots had strict instructions to take refuge in the airspace of neutral countries. This border crossing was due to a temporary oversight, so the British government has instructed its ambassador to Belgium to apologize to the Belgian government. (October 9th, Reuters)

Brussels – Three foreign planes flew over Belgian airspace last night. Two of them were identified as British heavy bombers. Belgian interceptors took off to pursue them. One of the bombers immediately landed, and the five pilots were arrested. The plane was carrying propaganda to be distributed over Germany. The second plane continued to move forward, and three Belgian interceptors pursued it to within six kilometers of French airspace before closing in. They then fired flares at the British plane, forcing it to land. Unexpectedly, the British plane failed to recognize them, mistakenly believing it was under attack, and immediately retaliated, immediately shooting down a Belgian plane. Two Belgian pilots jumped out with parachutes and were slightly injured. At that time, the British plane had already flown into French airspace. Public opinion in Belgium was extremely shaken after this incident, but because the Belgian Air Force was able to deal with it forcefully, it was indeed fulfilling its duties. (October 9th, Havas Dispatch)

Brussels – The Belgian Ministry of Defense issued a special communiqué last night, saying, "Three British heavy bombers were pursued by our air force. One of them was forced to land.

The two pilots jumped out with parachutes. The British plane's violation of our country's neutrality has led to our government lodging a serious protest with the British government." (October 10th, Associated Press)

London – British Ambassador to Belgium Clive visited Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak today to express his apology for the British plane's error in entering Belgian territory and the conflict with the Belgian plane.

### Sino-British Border Situation: Japanese Army Extends Blockade Line, Hong Kong Can Only Communicate with Macau, Completely Isolated from Guangdong Province Interior

Hong Kong Dispatch: The Japanese army is rapidly and frequently moving on the Sino-British border. Outsiders mistakenly believe that a large-scale withdrawal is underway, leading to rumors that the border situation has eased. There were also false reports of British troops returning home. The Hong Kong military authorities have repeatedly denied this. Simultaneously, the Japanese army has further extended the Hong Kong border blockade, starting from Daya Bay and extending west to the Tin Hau Temple in Chiwan, stationing troops along the Sino-British land and water border, isolating Kowloon completely. Details are as follows:

Japanese Army Completes Blockade of Hong Kong

According to official sources, the Japanese army on the border has not only not withdrawn but is expanding its operations. However, the Japanese army in Nantou has indeed decreased compared to three or four days ago. It is unknown whether they have returned to transport ships. It is believed that the movements of the Japanese army in Nantou are still within Bao'an territory. Official sources also indicate that the Japanese military operations have extended to the coastal area in front of蘋馬士灣, thus completing the blockade of Hong Kong. It is also understood that rumors have been circulating for days that the Japanese army in Nantou has begun to withdraw. The reason for their withdrawal is evidently to transfer troops to transport ships to Daya Bay, intending to land there to complete the plan to blockade the Hong Kong border. It is reported that a Japanese brigade (over 12,000 people) is stationed along the tip of the peninsula that divides蘋馬士灣 and Daya Bay, all the way to Nantou. As a result of the Japanese blockade, Hong Kong, apart from the route to Macau, is completely isolated from the mainland.

Mainland Food Cannot Be Transported to Hong Kong

When the Japanese army occupied Nantou to Shatoujiao, a large amount of food was transported by boat through Chinese waters into the British waters of蘋馬士灣, because the waters of蘋馬士灣 are British territory, and the shore is Chinese territory, so Japanese boats could not enter. The Japanese army has now expanded the blockade line to Daya Bay to prevent cargo boats from entering British territorial waters via this route. Maritime traffic between Hong Kong and Bao'an has resumed in the past two days, but because the Japanese have announced a ban on the transport of food to Hong Kong, the Bao'an transport boats operating on this route have suspended service again since August 30. It is said that the Japanese army not only prohibits goods from being transported out but also prohibits Nantou people from coming to Hong Kong, so even if the transport boats resume service, there will be no cargo or passengers.

Hong Kong Army Conducts Defense Drills

The Hong Kong army is scheduled to hold exercises in the southeast area of Hong Kong for two consecutive days, starting on the 31st, covering the area from Shau Kei Wan to Pok Fu Lam Road. The procedures for the exercises have not been announced by the army authorities, but it is understood that British, Middlesex, Scottish, Indian, and Lanford Tanner rifle teams and a volunteer army will participate, and machine gun units and armored vehicles will appear on various roads within the area. In addition to testing defense capabilities, great emphasis will also be placed on the speed of troop movements and flexibility of command. When the Sino-British border was tense, the Hong Kong government advised foreigners outside the border to move back to Kowloon or Hong Kong to avoid danger.

Governor of Hong Kong Implements Emergency Regulations

The Hong Kong government began calling up volunteer troops for service on ships on the 30th. In the afternoon, a gazette was issued stating that the Governor of Hong Kong, under the Emergency Powers Ordinance, summoned naval volunteers for service. The first group of fifty people was called up, including over twenty Chinese.

Air Defense Drills Simulate Air Raid Alerts

The Hong Kong military authorities, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, have been conducting air defense drills every night. At 9:30 pm on the 29th, the Hong Kong air defense department, assuming that it had received a report from a lookout post that enemy aircraft were planning to attack Hong Kong, immediately ordered all air defense units in Hong Kong to prepare. Soon after, a squadron of enemy aircraft, of unknown number, infiltrated Hong Kong airspace. All air search teams immediately gave a shout, and all lights were turned on, searching the sky. At that time, the enemy aircraft were extremely cunning and quickly evaded, making it difficult for the searchlights to find them. After several minutes, they were finally found. Only one aircraft had entered the city airspace. The searchlights then focused on one point, chasing and shooting at it, so that the anti-aircraft artillery could find the target. At that time, the enemy aircraft was completely illuminated in the flames, clear and distinct. Although it tumbled high and low, it could not escape the light net of the searchlights, and hastily fled out of the encirclement, while the searchlights continued to chase relentlessly until it disappeared. The airspace around Hong Kong was then searched again, and when no other aircraft were found, the drill was declared over. The Hong Kong Air Defense Department also reported that air raid sirens were tested at the Kowloon Dockyard and were also held at the Kowloon warehouse.

### Plague Rampant in Songjiang and Jiaxing; Japanese Troops Suffering Many Deaths; Rice Robbery Occurs in Jiaxing

Jiashan Correspondence: In Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Jiashan, cholera and dysentery are prevalent. Many people are dying one after another. People in the countryside are suffering from a lack of medicine and are resigned to their fate. The number of Japanese soldiers dying from the epidemic has already exceeded ten. Therefore, the Japanese troops in the three places have completely blockaded land and water traffic, prohibiting residents of the three places from going out. Women and children outside the city who want to enter the city must undergo strict inspection and disinfection before being allowed to enter. The pseudo-pacification unit under徐樸誠 arrived in 40 石 yesterday and were stationed inside and outside the city. The顧 family 洋房 in 顧家埭 was dismantled by the Japanese army, and it is rumored that the famous historical site東園 will be converted into a Japanese club. Many shops have been opened by Japanese in the city, such as 東都药堂, etc. New rice from the four villages is about to be marketed, but it is under the control of the Japanese, who are not allowed to transport it out of the territory. The price of rice is 22 yuan per 石. Several cases of rice robbery have occurred in the northwest villages.

### Wu County Puppet Government Levies Various Arbitrary Taxes; Recently Launches Household Donation

Suzhou Correspondence: Wu County's government expenses were abundant. Before the occupation, the income from land tax alone was sufficient to cover the county's expenses. The pseudo-county government was established last April. Although it still relies on land tax revenue, the situation is different now. Also, the four villages are controlled by the Chinese army, resulting in a total levy far less than in previous years. Although the pseudo-county government has scraped in various ways, it has been in debt for over 250,000 yuan for a year. Therefore, pseudo- Magistrate郭曾基 is planning to collect taxes from hotels, restaurants, soda, chimney sweeping, and daily necessities. Recently, a special household donation has been launched. All measures have been approved by the pseudo-county government advisory council and will be implemented soon. It is reported that the starting amount is 15%, but the people of Suzhou have already been unable to bear the heavy taxes levied by the pseudo-county government, and their livelihood will be even more difficult in the future.

### Zhejiang Education and Culture Association Collects Literature from the Occupied Areas

(Jinhua News) The Education and Culture Affairs Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Japanese War Committee recently held a committee meeting and resolved to suggest to the Provincial Anti-Japanese War Committee that a Zhejiang Provincial Collection Committee for Lost Literature from the Occupied Areas be established to be responsible for collecting lost literature. The original proposal stated that with the fall of western Zhejiang, there have been many losses of books both public and private within the province. Among them, there must be quite a few drawings and books that are important to the nation's cultural academics and inventions. Zhejiang Province is particularly the main cultural center of the southeast, and we are also moving forward to the great first step of the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction. We must fulfill our anti-Japanese defense responsibilities for the extension and development of national literature. It is proposed to advise the Provincial Anti-Japanese War Committee to establish the Zhejiang Provincial Collection Committee for Lost Literature from the Occupied Areas, with the standing committee member of the Provincial Anti-Japanese War Committee, the director of the Education Department, and the director of the Provincial Museum as ex officio members. The collection of lost literature should focus on important books and atlases related to national history and academic inventions. The scope of collection and storage methods will be properly discussed and formulated after the establishment of the committee.

### The Issue of Investing in the Southwest

— Editor

In the middle of last month, the Shanghai Banking and Financial Industry Friendship Association held a symposium to discuss investing in the Southwest. More than 20 people from the banking, financial, industrial, and commercial sectors attended. The editor, as an outsider, participated in the event and benefited greatly. The association originally intended to submit the minutes to this publication for disclosure, but due to the large amount of material, it was decided to have Mr. Wu, Mr. Hu, Mr. Shi, and Mr. Guan each take on a topic and complete this collective work. The four gentlemen are all economic experts and are very pessimistic about the future of Shanghai's economy. At the same time, they all see investing in the Southwest as the most reasonable way to adjust Shanghai's floating capital and industrial difficulties. Mr. Wu pointed out many of the reasons for past failures in investing in the Southwest, believing that the main reason was the availability of high profits in Shanghai. After calculating the current national policy, Mr. Shi believes that it is necessary to have a counter-prosperity policy. However, Mr. Hu and Mr. Guan pointed out that the prosperity of Shanghai and Hong Kong has come to an end, and high profits are waiting for capital to flow to the Southwest, but it must be combined with the means of production. As for the transfer of monetary funds, Mr. Wu believes that foreign exchange is the most suitable. These views can be said to be the biggest gains from the meeting's discussions. However, the editor believes that there is still a major issue that has not been resolved. That is, some people confuse investing in the Southwest with abandoning Shanghai. In the editor's personal opinion, this is a dangerous idea and should be considered carefully and thoroughly! Due to the sudden reduction in space in this issue, Mr. Guan's article has been temporarily withdrawn. We apologize for this.

### What Were the Root Causes in the Past?

— Wu Hong'an

As early as a year ago, the slogan of investing in the Southwest was already being shouted enthusiastically; however, the execution in the past was not vigorous enough, and there were still many difficulties that needed to be resolved urgently in the process of implementation, and the results were very limited. Although there are many reasons, the ease of doing business and making big money in Shanghai cannot be said to be a fundamental obstacle.

After the war, Shanghai's import and export trade was very active, and the black market for foreign exchange was convenient due to the concentration of population and capital. Industry and commerce were very active, and profits were very generous. Although the normal outlets for the financial industry were narrower than before, the black market transactions and arbitrage of foreign exchange were profitable. Capital inevitably flows to the most profitable places and goes from the most familiar places. The inland is indeed a treasure trove, waiting to be developed everywhere, but it is still a virgin land after all. To get rich, you have to use your mind and take considerable risks. Shanghai is safe and profitable. Except for a very small number of capitalists with a strong sense of national consciousness and broad vision, who would be willing to give up making money in front of them and choose the distant one?

Second: Shanghai's industrial environment is also better than the inland. Eighty or ninety years of development have made Shanghai the most important modern economic center, with all kinds of large and small industries gathered together, and the connections and needs between factories are very well coordinated. In addition, the purchase of raw materials, the promotion of products, the facilities for warehousing, insurance, etc., the supply of power, the skills of workers, the prosperity of the financial industry, ... none of them are more convenient than in the inland. Looking back at the Southwest, the factories are scattered here and there, and the conditions of raw materials, workers, power, financial institutions, etc. are far worse than in Shanghai.

Third: Inconvenient transportation and excessive transportation costs are also a major reason why manufacturers have not been able to relocate smoothly to the inland in the past. Shanghai's transportation to the Southwest now has to detour through Haiphong via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to reach the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. The transportation capacity of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is extremely small. How can a capacity of 100 tons per day cope with the goods pouring in from all over the southeast? Therefore, most of them are piled up. It is said that many manufacturers have transported their machinery to Haiphong, but there has been no news for half a year, and they cannot even find where the goods are. Transportation between various places in the Southwest, such as from Kunming to Chongqing, relies on highways, and the exorbitant highway freight is well known. When gasoline could be purchased for eight pennies a gallon, it was said that the freight from Shanghai via Haiphong to Kunming and then to Chongqing was 2,500 to 600 yuan per ton. Now, of course, it is even more expensive.

Fourth: The difficulty of transferring funds between the inland and Shanghai, that is, the exorbitant Shen exchange rate, is also a major obstacle to investing in the Southwest. The government restricts remittances from the inland to Shanghai, with the aim of preventing funds from escaping to Shanghai to buy foreign exchange. The principle is of course not objectionable. However, the funds remitted from the inland to Shanghai are of many types and different in nature. Some are the proceeds from the sale of goods in the inland by the industrial and commercial sectors, some are remittances from inland workers to their families in Shanghai, some are funds fleeing from the wealthy, and some are funds transferred from the inland to Shanghai for use by the financial sector. If the latter two types are treated the same as the former two, then once the proceeds from the goods of the industrial and commercial sectors enter the inland, they are in danger of being sealed off. Who would dare to have relations with the inland and then move to the inland to produce? If a Shanghai technician has to discount his wages by half before he can remit them out after arriving in the inland, then why should he bother to go to the inland to work hard? Therefore, the excessively strict restrictions on Shen exchange make it difficult for legitimate and illegitimate funds to flow, which is indeed a policy that urgently needs to be revised.

In addition, the obstruction of feudal forces in the inland and the bombing by Japanese planes everywhere are also reasons why people are not interested in investing in the Southwest. However, the bombing is no longer a major problem since the Trust Bureau has taken over the handling of the bombed areas.

Because of the above reasons, except for the hundreds of factories that were relocated with the assistance of the government in the early stages of the war and the few large industries newly established by several major banks in a few important cities in the Southwest after the war, Shanghai's achievements in investing in the Southwest in the past year and a half have been minimal.

As for the activities of the financial industry, they are based on the prosperity of the industry. In the Southwest, where there are few investment targets, the financial sector cannot achieve much. Many people believe that simply transporting a large amount of Shanghai's floating capital to the inland can achieve the goal of investing in the Southwest; however, they do not realize that a few legal tender notes cannot be considered capital, and simply transporting a part of the legal tender notes to the inland cannot be called an investment in the inland. Capital must be productive materials such as machinery, raw materials, etc., and only after turning the legal tender notes into such materials and making them active in the inland can it be considered an investment in the inland. Simply transferring legal tender notes to the inland without expanding productive forces will only plunge the inland into the abyss of inflation and will not have any other benefits. However, if the foreign exchange held by the general financial sector and the wealthy can be offered to the inland in an appropriate manner, it would be a powerful contribution, because foreign exchange is now China's most effective purchasing power for foreign countries and also a most valuable capital.

As for the government, although it has done a lot of work in promoting investment in the Southwest in the past, its efforts are still insufficient. It has not done its best to eliminate various obstacles for the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors in the inland, and it has not been vigorous enough in implementing various insurance, interest guarantees, subsidies, investigations, reporting, and other support and guidance work; in Shanghai, not only has it not adjusted and cracked down on various speculation and opportunism in a timely manner, but it has maintained the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai for a long time, allowing Shanghai's industry and commerce to prosper abnormally, which cannot but be said to be a major mistake of the government in the past.

Now, the black market for foreign exchange is no longer maintained, and the prosperity of industry and commerce is declining day by day. The government should take advantage of this change in the objective environment and implement appropriate policies: on the one hand, restrict Shanghai's economic activities, and on the other hand, open up broad avenues in the rear to integrate the resources and materials of the isolated island with the construction of the rear; then the various problems of investing in the Southwest in the past will sooner or later be gradually eliminated. Many people only know how to criticize capitalists for indulging in pleasure and putting the national crisis behind them; however, they do not understand that this is the result of the gathering of various objective forces, and the problem can only be solved after correcting the objective conditions.

### Changes in the Environment

— Hu Chengwu

In the past two years, the Chinese government has worked hard to encourage investment in the Southwest, and many capitalists have also gone to the inland to prepare for development; however, what the government advocates is a hope or an ideal; what the capitalists pursue is huge profits or the appreciation of capital. The goals of the two sides are inconsistent and cannot be made consistent, so the development of the Southwest in the past has only become a slogan and cannot be said to have any effect.

Although China's current political and economic institutions still do not allow the state itself to be the owner of various industries, nor can it manage or order all the property or means of production of capitalists, the state has the power to control and can also arrange the environment in various aspects to make it suitable for the production conditions of capitalists; recently, the government has apparently worked hard on this and has already shown considerable results.

We know that the development of the Southwest is not a simple issue of capital inflow, but includes the transfer of many means of production. Because simply the inflow of capital, and the inability to arbitrarily purchase the means of production in the inland, is still impossible to engage in development; moreover, if the inland is only short of capital, government banks can create credit and provide accommodation, and there is no need to rely on capital from Shanghai or Hong Kong and other places: therefore, the issue of capital transfer raised from the standpoint of developing the Southwest really needs to be annotated, that is, capital must be transferred to the inland in the form of means of production.

This kind of transfer has encountered many difficulties and suffered great twists and turns in the past, but recently the environment has changed, many difficulties have been overcome, and the transfer of capital and means of production to the inland can of course be smoother than before.

The so-called change in the environment is twofold: on the one hand, the decline in prosperity in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places, and on the other hand, the improvement of the industrial environment in the inland.

First, from the first aspect: since the fall in the exchange rate of legal tender, prices in the Shanghai market have soared. According to the ordinary principle of prosperity, industry must be stimulated and developed; however, Shanghai has become an isolated island, and the economic exchange with the occupied areas is not close. From the standpoint of many industrialists in China, their national consciousness does not allow them to communicate economic relations with the occupied areas; and from the standpoint of Japanese industrialists, they are also unwilling to have Chinese capital share their forbidden fruits, so the prosperity of Shanghai relies only on the consumption expenses of Shanghai itself; after the exchange rate falls, the general purchasing power decreases, and Shanghai's productivity loses its large support force, so it is forced to reduce work or stop. Among them, textile factories or flour factories that use foreign products as raw materials suffer even greater blows; many capitals cannot obtain profits in industry, and naturally become floating capitals, floating on the market, so the wind of speculation is very prosperous, and hoarding is endless. However, speculation is like gambling. If one side wins huge profits, the other side will suffer great losses. Individual property may change greatly, but the total capital will never increase, so the road is not a legitimate way to make a profit and cannot be sustained; fortunately, there is still a way now, which is the way out for these floating capitals, and the future is very promising, that is, the development of the Southwest; therefore, since the fall in the exchange rate, investing in the Southwest has once again become the main topic of Shanghai industrialists.

As for the environment in Hong Kong, it is also similar to that in Shanghai. Since the fall of Guangzhou last year, the contact artery between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland has been cut off by Japan, so the economic situation in Hong Kong is similar to that in Shanghai after the occupation. The main thing is to rely on the consumption of refuge people to maintain its production and trade. At the same time, it uses its proximity to the Southwest to supply the inland with daily industrial products. However, since the fall in the exchange rate of legal tender, the Chinese refuge people have gradually felt the difficulty of life and have moved to the inland one after another; and the industrial products produced by Hong Kong's industry have also become expensive after being converted into legal tender and cannot be sold in the inland, so they have to stop working. In addition, the European situation is tense recently, and there is a possibility of the outbreak of war. If the war really happens, the UK may not be able to take care of the safety of Hong Kong because its reach is too long; and the Japanese army has taken the opportunity to occupy Shenzhen, threatening Kowloon, and claiming to lock up Hong Kong, so Hong Kong's industry has the need to move to a better place both economically and militarily, and their only way out is the mainland. Therefore, the transfer of capital and means of production from Hong Kong to the inland has been very prosperous recently. It is said that the deposits withdrawn from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in Hong Kong totaled more than 20 million yuan in the week from August 20 to 26, so it had to restrict deposits and withdrawals to maintain itself; this fact is clear evidence of the inflow of capital and undoubtedly makes a great contribution to the development of the Southwest.

Looking at the industrial environment in the inland, although the government initially moved to the inland two years ago, it took the development of the Southwest as its main policy agenda, but because of the many political affairs, it did not have time to immediately establish a detailed plan, so it did not see any effect; however, after two years of hard work, the resources and products of various places have been finely investigated, and the development plan and direction have been specifically finalized. Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economy, has published a paper stipulating the division between state-owned industries and private industries. The government will never compete with the people for profits in all industries that enrich the lives of the people in the inland and strengthen the country's anti-war forces; and it plans to do its best to support and encourage them in order to overcome various unfavorable conditions in the inland. At the same time, because the development of transportation is a prerequisite for the transfer of means of production, the Ministry of Communications has spared no effort in developing transportation routes. The completion of the Burma Road, the construction of the Burma Railway, the enrichment of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and the connection of the Xiang-Gui and Gui-Yue railways are all the highest achievements in a short period of time. Recently, the Southwest Transportation Company has 2,000 military vehicles and has recruited 600 teachers to train technical personnel in transportation on a large scale, so the transportation capacity will definitely be greatly improved in the future. Although it is too early to say that this will solve all transportation problems, many difficulties that existed before can be overcome in the process of building the Southwest industry. In addition, the Ministry of Finance's encouragement of capital transfer to the inland, the restriction of remittances from the occupied areas, and the instruction of the Central Trust Bureau to handle all war risk insurance are all sufficient to guarantee the capital and safety of inland industries, and are also a very good catalyst for industrial transfer. Therefore, judging from the government's various facilities, the industrial environment in the inland has greatly improved, and it is indeed very different from before.

The changes in the environment on both sides have created a new situation, that is, the transfer of capital or industry has become the only way out for the people and private capital in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places. Not only can they directly obtain huge profits from this, but they can also indirectly contribute to the construction of the country's economic foundation, so except for those who have no national consciousness or are short-sighted, no industrialist or capitalist will hesitate.

### How Should the State Strive?

— Shi Yiwen

Looking at the actual situation of the Southwest construction in the past, there are quite a few commendable places. Although it is still far from the actual needs and ideal goals, many wartime industries have been established in a short period of time, especially the transportation construction, which has achieved amazing results. However, we believe that what is regrettable is that Shanghai, which occupies the central position in China, has participated very little in this great cause. We do not deny that after the national army withdrew to the west, many of Shanghai's industries continued to move to the inland, but judging from the ratio (the number of relocations and the number of remaining in Shanghai), it is very small.

Why did so few of Shanghai's industries move to the inland? Of course, it is not because the industrialists in Shanghai do not love the country, but there are objective reasons.

First, because transportation in the inland is inconvenient, it is factually difficult to transport heavy machinery.

Second, they are not familiar with the situation in the inland, and they are not accustomed to the life there.

Third, the relocation costs are huge, which ordinary industrial capital cannot afford, and the government has no specific assistance methods.

Fourth, industries have mutual links. If industry A cannot move, industry B has to adopt the policy of following suit.

Fifth, many industrial raw materials are not easy to obtain in the inland; certain industrial products cannot be sold in the inland.

Sixth, there is a risk of bombing in the inland, which is not as safe as Shanghai.

The above reasons are indeed the difficulties in the internal relocation of Shanghai's industry. However, what we want to point out here is that this is not the most fundamental reason. The most fundamental reason is: "There are high profits to be made in Shanghai." Because there are high profits to be made in Shanghai, even if the industrialists generally understand that their business should be relocated internally, they are ultimately lured by the "high profits" and are reluctant to leave. Capital flows to profitable areas, which is an iron rule of capitalist economics, and national consciousness cannot defeat it.

If the reluctance of Shanghai's industry to stay in Shanghai only affects the economic construction of the Southwest and does not harm the future of the nation, then it is not something that is worthy of attention. But the fact is not the case. Because:

First, the development of Shanghai's industry absorbs a lot of capital and a large number of industrial technicians, which is obviously an obstacle to the economic construction of the Southwest.

Second, because transportation between Shanghai and the inland is inconvenient, Shanghai's supply of materials to the inland is in fact very little possible. On the contrary, due to:

Third, its geographical proximity to the occupied areas, it has a closer economic exchange relationship with the occupied areas than with the inland: therefore, it makes Shanghai's economic relationship with the inland increasingly estranged and becomes a supporter of a certain policy.

Fourth, due to the development of Shanghai's industry, a large number of foreign goods are imported, resulting in a huge trade deficit, which puts a heavy burden on the legal tender, weakens China's economic power, and endangers China's entire financial structure.

Therefore, we believe that the industrial development of Shanghai not only indirectly prevents the development of the economic construction of the Southwest, but also directly endangers China's entire wartime economic organization, posing a huge threat to China.

But how to make Shanghai's industry move to the inland? Simply promoting it in words, or setting up subsidy and insurance and other incentive methods to persuade, will not have a practical effect: because industrialists "have high profits to be made in Shanghai", so they will not go to the inland automatically.

Then, the basic fact that caused Shanghai industrialists to have high profits in the past was undoubtedly the government's willingness to maintain the black market for foreign exchange and the Shanghai market at the cost of great sacrifice. This policy should be reconsidered immediately!

Although, since June 7, the government's policy has changed somewhat, it is not thorough enough. Although Shanghai is not as prosperous as it used to be, there is still blood-sucking and speculative opportunities; of course: implementing a counter-prosperity policy in the Shanghai market may be subject to many diplomatic and political constraints, but if you see the poison and are afraid to have surgery, it will harm the whole body. Put it to death and then live, this is the only effective way to deal with the numb!

Commercial News

### Finance: Cash Black Market Plummets, Falling Nearly 100 Yuan Compared to the Previous Day's Unofficial Price

The cash black market plummeted yesterday due to the Monday holiday, so there was no official market price. It is said that the day before yesterday (9th) afternoon, because of speculative bulls, in view of the two-day consecutive decline in gold prices, took advantage of the foreign exchange holiday on Saturday afternoon, they fabricated something out of nothing, and spread rumors that foreign exchange would change again on Monday, and that the central government would allow foreign exchange to fluctuate freely, etc. At the same time, they raised the price sharply to the 4,000 yuan mark. Large gold shops quoted 400 yuan per gram, and new shops quoted 398 yuan, but because most operators did not believe the above news, they took the opportunity to sell high, and the price fell. At noon, the purchase price at the money exchange shops was 3,880 yuan, and the selling price was 3,920 yuan, a drop of nearly 100 yuan compared to the previous day's unofficial price.

The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael was 400 yuan by the large shops. Until 9:45, it was reduced by five yuan. The large shops then changed to 395 yuan, and the new shops to 393 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan.

London, 9th: The price of British pure gold remains fixed at 8 pounds and 8 shillings per ounce.

### Indian Silver Declines

Bombay, 9th: The spot price of Indian silver suddenly declined by ten annas, to 56 rupees and 08 annas. Futures for September and October also declined by sixteen annas, to 56 rupees. A total of 100 contracts were traded. The market was flat. No reports have been received from the British and American silver markets.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Soar

Since the outbreak of the European war, sugar prices have soared in recent days due to problems with the source of supply. Not only are people in the industry paying attention, but people outside the industry are also兼营, so the trading of sugar has a speculative feeling. Yesterday, the guild's settlement price rose even more sharply, with the increase reaching as much as six or seven yuan. The initial price of 24 crude white in the main warehouse was 61 yuan, and then rose to 63 yuan and 30 cents. The price in the outer warehouse was 60 yuan and 20 cents to 63 yuan, and the price of re-export was 50 yuan. The price of Taikoo granulated white B mark rose from 65 yuan directly to 70 yuan. The remaining marks followed suit. The current price of H mark and red mark was 52 yuan and 50 cents. The price of Dutch red spot was 52 yuan to 54 yuan, and the price of re-export was 44 yuan. The price of the number 1 native soft white was 63 yuan, the price of native rock sugar was 70 yuan, the price of Jingming rock sugar was 71 yuan and 50 cents, and the price of national sugar coarse blue also soared by about five yuan, opening at 40 yuan (cash), and 400 bags were traded.

### Hardware: Black Iron Billets Reach the 100 Yuan Mark

The long-silent black iron billets have soared along with other goods since the outbreak of the European war. However, the rate of increase is only half that of other goods. Only in the last two days have toy factories, thermos bottle factories, printing factories, and printing plants in this street all made purchases, and the largest sales volume is still among general囤戶, with hundreds of担 going in and out every day. The holders' psychology has become昂, and the standard has also been喊高不已, from 75 yuan, to 80 yuan, to 90 yuan, until yesterday, the last selling plate has been喊 to 100 yuan.

### Dried Goods: Hainan New Longan Meat - Up Another Five Yuan

Hainan new longan meat, when the price was reduced before, the customer held on to the goods that had not been兑 due to cost considerations. Yesterday, some continued to open, and the price rose another five yuan compared to before, and it has been scarce recently, so the trend is extremely firm.

### Japanese and Puppet Police Build Roads Beyond the Border; Continue to Seize Two Houses Yesterday; Puppet Police Establish Branch Office on Avenue Joffre; Concession Police Continue to Perform Duties

In the areas beyond the Shanghai West Concession where roads are being built, such as Avenue Joffre and Yu Yuan Road, Japanese troops and puppet police have been frequently moving about recently. However, the concession police officers in those areas are still performing their duties as usual, so the concession's police authority remains normal. Since the puppet police arbitrarily moved into the Tzu Lien No. 31 Refugee Shelter the day before yesterday, several other locations were targeted yesterday. For example, puppet police went to the staff dormitory of a certain bank near the Jing'an Temple Road and Di Feng Road, intending to take up residence there. The concession authorities are paying close attention to the recent situation in Shanghai West. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:

Concession Authorities Prepare Cautiously as Situation Develops

For days, the situation in Shanghai West has been tense due to the frequent movements of Japanese and puppet troops. Residents, not understanding the reason, inevitably made many speculations, leading to a sudden state of unease. The Japanese and puppet troops often moved in without the consent of the homeowners. Yesterday, it was learned that both concessions, with the imminent approach of the "September 18th Incident" anniversary, decided to implement special precautions starting yesterday to ensure order and peace within the concessions. Additional detectives have been stationed at all key intersections, and close defense has been established especially in areas bordering the Chinese-controlled areas of Shanghai West. These precautions within the two concessions will be lifted after the "September 18th Incident." As for the precautions in the areas beyond the Shanghai West Concession, it is said that measures will be adapted at any time depending on the needs of the situation.

According to a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency who conducted an on-site inspection in the Shanghai West area yesterday afternoon, the details are as follows:

Japanese Inspect Orphanage Middle School

The afternoon before yesterday, at 4 p.m., Japanese and puppet troops invaded the Tzu Lien Branch No. 31 Refugee Shelter on Avenue Joffre, which is beyond the concession's road construction area, and expelled all the "Si Ge" (private watchmen) from the lanes on Avenue Joffre. Upon receiving the report, the British Defense Force Headquarters immediately dispatched a troop of soldiers to conduct a security watch across from the shelter. The British army was ordered to retreat, and the situation eased. In the evening, the Japanese and puppet troops withdrew the majority of their forces, leaving only a dozen or so people behind. After 10 p.m., two Japanese officers suddenly entered the orphanage middle school inside the shelter, supposedly for inspection. Staff members of the school accompanied them on a tour of the school grounds. The two Japanese officers asked who was sponsoring the school and the source of the students. The staff explained that it was sponsored by various charitable organizations and that the students were refugee children recommended by various shelters. They also asked why the students' clothing was so neat even though they were refugee children. The staff informed them that they were gifts from various charitable organizations. The two Japanese officers then left without further comment.

Solid Fortifications Rebuilt Yesterday Morning

Yesterday morning, the Japanese and puppet troops increased their numbers by more than thirty people, and they dismantled and rebuilt the temporary fortifications that had been piled up in front of the gate. What was originally built in front of the gate was now moved to both sides of the gate, presumably to facilitate the entry and exit of vehicles. A Japanese officer supervised the construction on-site, which seemed more solid than before, indicating that they had no intention of withdrawing.

Two Houses Continue to be Invaded

The houses that continued to be occupied by the Japanese and puppet troops yesterday morning included: (1) Qiuyuan at No. 15 Avenue Joffre and the Maosheng Kang Ji Lumber Company (next door to the west of the shelter), where a puppet police station was set up. (2) A staff dormitory of a certain bank at No. 1760 Jing'an Temple Road (near Di Feng Road). More than 40 staff members lived there. Yesterday morning around 8 a.m., four or five puppet police officers suddenly arrived at the door of the building and posted a notice, stating that the bank staff should leave quickly so that the building could be used as an office. At 8:45 a.m., more than a dozen puppet police and Japanese military police arrived and demanded to take over the entire dormitory. Four armed Japanese military police, armed with rifles and live ammunition, were stationed at the dormitory entrance. A group of puppet police and Japanese military police entered and searched the building. At that time, two passenger cars belonging to the bank for transporting staff were parked at the entrance. Fortunately, the puppet police signaled and the drivers understood, so they drove towards Jing'an Temple Road to avoid being detained. The staff members negotiated with the puppet police for a long time, but to no avail. The staff then prepared to move out. Although there are Japanese troops stationed at the entrance, staff members are still free to enter and exit.

Key Points Occupied by Japanese and Puppet Troops

In addition, reporters saw that at the entrances of Siming Villa on Yu Yuan Road and Zhongshi New Village, there were seven or eight puppet police officers armed with guns stationed. It was heard that starting at 8 p.m. every day, residents were prohibited from entering or leaving. At the intersection of Kena Road, which is beyond the concession's road construction area on the west end of Siming Villa, there were also more than a dozen Japanese and puppet troops stationed. It was heard that the "Si Ge" (private watchmen) from the lanes on Yu Yuan Road were also expelled yesterday. Near the Kangjia Bridge on Avenue Joffre, puppet police have also been deployed at posts. By this point, it can be said that the key points of the Shanghai West road construction area beyond the concession have been completely controlled by the Japanese army as of yesterday. In front of the headquarters of the Japanese military police and the puppet police station on Avenue Joffre, defensive fortifications have been built since yesterday.

Shanghai West Police Officers Performing Their Duties as Usual

The section from Avenue Joffre to Caojiadu was previously patrolled by police vehicles dispatched by the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, and their presence could be seen in the Wujiaochang area. Since yesterday, they have disappeared without a trace. When reporters passed by the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, they saw three police vehicles that were responsible for patrolling the area parked near the Yu Yuan Road Post Office. However, the patrol officers who originally held positions in the Shanghai West area were still stationed and performing their duties as usual yesterday. There was no interference from the Japanese and puppet police in the movement of pedestrians and vehicles. In areas such as Columbia Road and Anhe Temple Road, reporters did not see large numbers of Japanese and puppet troops stationed, but according to residents, Japanese and puppet troops patrolled day and night, in groups of seven or eight or more than ten people, but there were no other movements.

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, while the attention of local people is focused on the war reports of Poland's development, the Japanese are plotting to

Control Shanghai

This morning (the 10th) they went a step further. Several trucks carrying armed Da Dao (Great Way) police and Japanese military police reinforced the Da Dao police who had taken over the police stations in the Avenue Joffre area yesterday (the 9th). All of these people were equipped with rifles and bayonets, waiting for orders. In the two police stations on Avenue Joffre,

Da Dao police in military uniform and armed with guns gathered, and another police station was full of Japanese military police. The Da Dao police are also stationed at the police stations on Kena Road and Kang Nao Wan Road, but there is no action to take over other long-disputed extraterritorial roads, such as Yu Yuan Road, Bailinan Road, Daxilu, and Kaixuan Road. It is verified that the area is part of the British military defense zone, and the Public Concession police continue to patrol the area.

British Soldiers Inspected Yesterday Morning

Also, it is reported that the "Da Dao" puppet police who invaded the Shanghai West road construction area beyond the concession have not shown any intention of withdrawing. Therefore, the tension caused by the local area still exists. At around 7:30 a.m. yesterday morning, the British army garrison near Di Feng Road sent two trucks loaded with British soldiers to conduct an on-site inspection in front of the Tzu Lien No. 31 shelter on Avenue Joffre, which was partially occupied by the puppet police. However, after the British army arrived at the scene, the Japanese military police unit stationed nearby also dispatched a squad of Japanese soldiers to the 31st shelter to assist the puppet police. Therefore, the British soldiers stayed for a short time and then returned in their vehicles.

### Nationals of Warring Countries in Shanghai Maintain Calm Minds; Collectively Seek to Adjust Emotions to Cope with the Crisis; Shared Hardship During the Shanghai War Two Years Ago

The Shanghai Times states that Shanghai is an international city with people from all over the world. There has never been a greater need for foreigners to restrain their emotions and think calmly than in the past seven days. A week ago, Britain and France successively declared the existence of a state of war with Germany, and the emotions of the World War that broke out 25 years ago naturally resurfaced. However, in recent days, nationals of the warring countries have concluded that mutual hostile actions are of no benefit. Since the beginning of last week, nationals of various countries in this city have repeatedly expressed their ability to maintain a calm mind even in the most critical times. Today (the 10th) marks one week since Britain, France, and Poland declared war on Germany. It is unpredictable whether more countries will eventually be drawn into the vortex of war. However, there are many nationals of the four major warring countries residing in this city. They are forced to stay here, and many of them are eager to join their country's army and serve as volunteers, but only a few have been able to leave Shanghai for active duty. It is surprising that only one unfortunate incident has occurred among the nationals of the warring countries in Shanghai in the past week. According to a foreigner who has lived in Shanghai for a long time, Shanghai has become accustomed to disturbances, and its citizens have experienced many political upheavals and dangers, so they are better able to adjust their emotions to cope with crises than citizens of other cities in the world. Now, the nationals of the warring countries remember defending their mutual interests in Shanghai shoulder to shoulder during the Shanghai War two years ago. Even if the governments of European countries are at odds, this unique bond and emotion is not easily forgotten. In the past week, the nationals of the four countries in Shanghai—Britain, France, Poland, and Germany—have had to readjust

Their relationships. British nationals of military service age volunteer to serve their country, but the British authorities have instructed them to stay in Shanghai to continue business and to be summoned when needed. French reservists have been called up and will depart for their country at any time. The German authorities have instructed German nationals on what duties they will perform in the future. Polish nationals have also received instructions. There are also many young men of other nationalities who are willing to serve the British and French governments, but the authorities have advised them to wait and see how things develop. In general, in the past week, Shanghai, apart from being more restricted in commerce and having underlying anxieties, has had little noticeable reaction to the tragic developments in Europe. What the situation will be next week and in the future is what the general foreign community in Shanghai will calmly and firmly await.

### Speculation by Cargo Owners Leads to Sharp Rise in Prices of Imported Goods; Abundant Stocks of Hardware and Dyes; Soaring Paper Prices Affect Culture

After the Sino-Japanese War, the prices of imported goods from Europe and the United States had already risen significantly due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Since the outbreak of the German-Polish War, the stimulus to prices in Shanghai has been profound. As a result, the prices of various imported goods in Shanghai have risen irregularly in the past ten days. In reality, the European war has not expanded, and shipping between the Mediterranean and the Far East has not been interrupted. The biggest reason is that those who own the goods are hoarding and speculating, deliberately manipulating the market, causing prices to change rapidly and continue to rise. In practice, stocks of goods in Shanghai such as hardware, dyes, and wool fabrics are quite substantial. However, the owners are unwilling to sell, waiting for a better price, which has led to the current situation. According to news from the hardware industry, the prices of some hardware products have continued to rise several times over in the past week. For example, a 100-pound barrel of foreign nails has now risen to 60 yuan, and some are even asking for 70 or 80 yuan. Before the German-Polish War, it was only about 30 yuan per barrel. The same is true for dyes. The soaring price of paper these days is also particularly alarming. According to yesterday's market prices, each ream of newspaper has risen to 26 yuan, and each pound of Daolin paper has risen to 6 jiao, with a continued upward trend. The sharp rise in paper prices has had a significant impact on the cultural and educational sectors.

### Italian Mail Ship Seeks Profit, Sets Sail for Europe on Schedule

The Eurasia route of the Italian Mail Ship Company's, the Conte Verde line, which was supposed to come to Shanghai on the 28th of last month, was changed to the Giulio Cesare, which sails on the North African line. After the ship arrived in port, it stayed in Shanghai awaiting orders because war had broken out in Europe. After the Italian government stated its position a few days ago, the ship received a telegram from the head office ordering it to return to Europe. The Shanghai office immediately handled the procedures for loading cargo and selling passenger tickets. Due to the lack of ships traveling from Shanghai to Europe, passengers and cargo were jammed. The ship was the first to go to Europe after the worsening of the situation in Europe, so cargo was unusually congested and all procedures were not easy to handle, so it was postponed again. It is now known that it has been decided to set sail for export on the morning of the 14th, and passengers must board the ship on the evening of the 13th. The small shuttle boat prepared by the company for picking up passengers has not decided whether to depart from the Custom House pier at 8 p.m. on the 13th.

### Ministry of Finance Consolidates Legal Tender, Shanghai Financial Market Stabilizes, Foreign Exchange Trends Stabilize, Bond Prices Rise, All Sectors Transfer Assets to the Interior to Develop Industries

After the Ministry of Finance announced the outlines of measures to consolidate finance and the outlines of measures to improve central financial institutions in wartime, the four banks—Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China—formed a joint office, consolidated the basis for legal tender reserves, implemented open inspection, tried their best to stabilize foreign exchange, supplied legitimate needs as much as possible, absorbed social idle funds, completed the southwestern and northwestern financial networks, and strived to handle production enterprise loans. Therefore, China's finance will become healthier, and the Shanghai financial market has improved as a result. The black market for foreign exchange has stabilized and has gradually loosened compared to before, while the legal foreign exchange price of the Central Bank has remained unchanged. The black market for gold has fallen in price due to speculation by sellers, and the rise and fall of foreign currencies of various countries are not as drastic as in the past. Buyers in the black market for securities are quite active and prices have risen. The forward premium for remittances has not fluctuated much. Rumors in the market about finance and currency have ceased, and people's hearts have gradually become stable. All those who have capital are transferring assets to the southwest and northwest to assist the government in completing inland construction and developing various inland industries. The government is fully supporting the development of various production enterprises, so China's production enterprises will make rapid progress in the future. Recently, remittances from Shanghai to the interior have increased sharply, and banks are providing various conveniences and waiving remittance fees. All Shanghai payments for remittances or banknotes with place names such as Central, Communications, Tianjin, Shandong, Han, can be exchanged for full legal tender in the interior.

### Restaurant Industry Finds Solution for Small Change Shortage, Association Issues Substitute Vouchers, Fish Industry Recalls Substitute Vouchers

The Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association, because Juxing Restaurant was forced to close due to a lack of small change and other members have asked for a remedy for this difficulty, has printed two types of substitute vouchers, one fen and five fen, in order to relieve the current problem of change shortage. It notified its members yesterday, stating that due to the lack of copper coins in the market, it is difficult to find small change, and asked to issue substitute vouchers to seek relief. Once the national government issues small denomination subsidiary coins, the association will collect them back at their face value. Therefore, it plans to print one fen and five fen vouchers, and hopes that each industry will prepare funds to collect and use them to facilitate the small change for refugee donations. If the industry believes it is necessary, they must first send a letter applying for a certain amount of fractional vouchers in order to proceed. This is to notify you. Also, Da Tong Company issued a notice yesterday, stating that "Due to the lack of copper coins in the market, it is very difficult to find small change for buying and selling. In order to facilitate the industry and fishmongers, a one-fen temporary substitute voucher has been printed for use. Unexpectedly, some lawless people dared to counterfeit them, harming users and committing serious crimes. In addition to sending staff to conduct a thorough investigation, the temporary substitute voucher will be recalled uniformly, limited to September 30th. Anyone holding a one-fen temporary substitute voucher from Da Tong Fish Industry Company, please exchange it for legal currency at the company as soon as possible. This is a notice."

### Jiangnan Mobile Unit: Active Along the Jinghu Line; Surrender of Puppet Troops at the Junction of Suzhou and Changzhou; Thorough Excavation of Highway Culverts Overnight

The highest authorities of the Jiangnan Mobile Unit, since deciding to advance the × Route Army eastward, several months have passed, encountering numerous hardships. Its vanguard troops recently progressed from the Japanese defense zone to Qingpu. Around Liuhe, Luodian, and the Wusong River, there were engagements with Japanese troops. The battles of Luodian and the Wusong River were the fiercest. When the vanguard of the × Detachment approached Weidian, it was discovered by Japanese spies, who reported it to the Japanese military. The Japanese then dispatched over two hundred soldiers to encircle the vanguard troops. The two sides immediately opened fire. Fortunately, the Chinese rear guard arrived in time, and the Japanese were forced to flee in all directions. In this battle, over eighty Japanese soldiers were killed, and over fifty rifles were seized. The fierce fighting lasted for three hours. According to a certain company commander who participated in the battle, the Luodian battle was the most intense since the eastward advance. The situation at the time was extremely critical, beyond the reach of rifle power. Even machine guns, normally advantageous in storming positions, were abandoned. Hand grenades were used instead, demonstrating the intensity of the fighting. It was reported that on the 28th of last month, a Japanese-hired steamer towing seven civilian boats was sailing upstream near Yujidun on the Wusong River. When it reached a certain point, two civilian boats were sunk by the mobile unit on the shore. Over fifty Japanese soldiers also died. The Japanese never retaliated, fleeing in panic. Recently, guerrilla warfare has become extremely common in the suburbs of Shanghai. However, the number of Japanese casualties is kept secret, and news is delayed, so outsiders rarely know the details.

Resolution of Puppet Troops in the Western Suburbs of Wuxi

According to someone from Suzhou, the Jiangnan Mobile Unit in the three counties of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, on this month's [illegible] day, early in the morning, dispatched a unit of over two hundred soldiers from the × Detachment of the × Route Army to attack the stronghold of the puppet army led by Gu Fuxing outside the West Gate of Wuxi, seven li away. Within twenty minutes, the stronghold was completely resolved. It is estimated that over twenty puppet soldiers died, and battalion commander Fan was also killed on the spot. Over thirty were captured alive, and over twenty short guns and over thirty rifles were seized. Because the location was quite close to the city, the Japanese army in the city, upon hearing the alarm, urgently dispatched a battalion to reinforce. By the time they reached the destination, the mobile unit had already withdrawn.

Major Victory for Chinese Army at the Junction of Suzhou and Changzhou

In retaliation, the Japanese and puppet troops did not hesitate to mobilize a large army, dispatching two hundred Japanese soldiers and over five hundred puppet soldiers, with the puppet soldiers as the vanguard. They also carried heavy weapons such as small mortars, hired a motorboat towing five civilian boats, and advanced. When they approached Weijingtang at the junction of Suzhou and Changzhou and disembarked, they were spotted by the × Route Army sentries, who rushed back to report. More than three hundred soldiers of the × Detachment, who had combat experience, were sent to intercept them. Taking advantage of the fact that they had not completely landed, they surrounded them and shouted, "Drop your weapons, we are our own people!" The Japanese and puppet troops were caught off guard and unable to respond. As a result, over three hundred puppet soldiers who had landed surrendered completely. Seeing the situation was not good, the Japanese opened full throttle and fired small mortars, fleeing while firing. In this battle, not a single soldier was injured or killed, achieving a great victory. They also seized two heavy machine guns, five light machine guns, two hundred and sixteen rifles, over ten pistols, and seven boxes of ammunition. Over three hundred surrendered puppet soldiers who volunteered to join the army were transferred to the rear for training. Those who did not wish to join the army had their names registered and were given five yuan each for travel expenses.

Blockaded Culverts Enrage Farmers

The Japanese army, suffering a great loss in the Weijingtang battle, could not suppress its hatred. Therefore, it changed its strategy, adopting a method of cutting off the water supply at the source. Because there were many bridges and culverts on the waterways, making it easy for the mobile unit to ambush, they completely blocked all the culverts along the hundred-plus li of the Suzhou-Changzhou Highway. However, farmers relied entirely on the culverts for irrigation. Now that they were completely blocked by the Japanese and puppet troops, it was no different from cutting off the farmers' livelihoods. In anger, they rushed to report to the Jiangnan Mobile Unit headquarters, demanding prompt relief to alleviate the suffering of the people of Suzhou. The highest authorities of the headquarters summoned political and training personnel and, at night, dispatched the entire team, calling on and automatically participating in the labor of over a thousand farmers, working through the night to excavate all the culverts that had been blocked by the Japanese army, and completely destroying the bridges and roads, disrupting transportation. It is reported that they had only recently been repaired.

Contacts in Fushan and Baidu

After completing this task, for the sake of a permanent solution, the mobile unit searched along the Suzhou-Changzhou Highway. Unexpectedly, when they reached Xushu, they encountered Japanese troops being transferred back to Changshu. The two sides immediately opened fire, engaging in a fierce battle for about an hour. Over forty Japanese soldiers were captured alive, and one light machine gun and over fifty rifles were seized. There have been recent contacts in Fushan, which belongs to Changshu, and Baidu, which belongs to Suzhou. The Japanese army is overwhelmed, because the Japanese troops in the occupied areas are sparse and cannot be dispatched, and they are already exhausted.

Misunderstanding Occurs in the West of Qibao

At lunchtime on the second of this month, gunshots suddenly erupted in the west of Qibao for about ten minutes and stopped. The nearby villagers mistakenly believed that the Japanese army had come to the village to search, and everyone was panicked, fleeing without anywhere to go. According to a visitor from west Shanghai, it was learned that the gunfire was caused by a misunderstanding between the guerrilla unit led by Xu Xingzhou and the friendly unit led by Yao Youlian due to incorrect information. A certain informant used by Xu's unit had a long-standing feud with Yao. That day, he fabricated information based on his personal grudge. Commander Gu of the × Battalion believed it to be true, leading to this unfortunate conflict. Xu Xingzhou was a mid-level military officer in the former 45th Brigade. Last year, when the 45th Brigade was ordered to move west, Xu's unit did not follow, remaining in the west of Shanghai, and changed the banner to the × Detachment of the National Salvation Army. Now, after the 45th Brigade completed its training this spring and was reorganized into the New 30th Division, there is talk of them being ordered to reorganize the guerrillas in the Shangsongqing area. Xu also intends to join the New 30th Division. However, the units under Xu's command are quite complex and have not undergone rigorous training, so they will be extensively reorganized to become an elite force.

### Zhou Hua Arrested

Zhou Hua, from Hangzhou, Zhejiang, was recently arrested by the Japanese. According to the Japanese, Zhou is related to Chongqing military organizations, but it has not been confirmed whether he is working for us. Zhou resides in an apartment on Luban Road. According to the Japanese-language "Continental New Report," Zhou came to Shanghai to join the Huadong News Agency, attempting to use his position to get close to Japanese reporters. However, the news agency denied yesterday that there was anyone named Zhou among its staff. It is still kept secret how the Japanese will deal with Zhou after his arrest.

### Case of Father An Murdered; Perpetrator Surrenders; Named Ju Bailu; Has Been Suspended by the Church; Also Claims Main Culprit, A Mu Lin, Has Fled

Father An, a French national and director of the orphanage of the Tushanwan Catholic Church in Xujiahui, French Concession, was suddenly murdered in his bedroom upstairs in the orphanage at around 5:00 PM on the 30th of last month. Many days have passed, and after a thorough investigation by the French police, Ju Bailang, a key suspect in the case, knowing that it was unavoidable, surrendered to the French police at 9:10 PM the night before (the 9th), admitting to being an accessory to the murder of Father An. He claimed that the main culprit, A Mulin, was on the run, and that there were five people who carried out the murder, etc. The police are currently conducting a strict investigation of the suspect. According to the "News Agency Reporter," the criminal Ju Bailang is 25 years old and currently lives at No. 7, Ciyou Street, Refugee Zone, Xujiahui. It is heard that the criminal Ju's parents were originally Catholics and have both passed away. When Ju was young, he was raised by the church and, when he became an adult, was introduced to work in the printing room of the Tushanwan Church. Usually, according to church regulations, Catholics can receive a subsidy of 20 yuan when they get married. This spring, when Ju got married, he repeatedly requested this from Father An, but because Ju's conduct was improper, he had been suspended and therefore was not entitled to this marriage subsidy. Afterwards, Ju was extremely dissatisfied with Father An and often made threatening remarks.

Furthermore, it is reported that Father An, a French national and director of the orphanage craft factory established by the Tushanwan Catholic Church in Xujiahui, Shanghai, was suddenly murdered in his bedroom on the 30th of last month. The murderer escaped from the scene, and the French police dispatched investigators and offered a reward for his capture. Suddenly, at around 9:00 PM the day before yesterday, Ju Bolu, a 25-year-old native of Pudong, residing at No. 7, Ziyou Street, Refugee Zone, Xujiahui, went to the French police station and declared that he was an accessory to the murder of Father An, a French national and director of the orphanage craft factory of the Tushanwan Catholic Church. He also confessed that the main culprit was nicknamed A Mulin, and that there were a total of five accomplices at the time of the murder. He admitted that he helped to hold down Father An's feet at the time. Based on his confession, the police chief immediately detained him and transferred him to the Criminal Section of the General Police Station for investigation by Chinese and Western detectives. A strict investigation is currently underway to arrest the fugitive accomplices.

### Beating to Death; Three Arrested by Japanese Troops; Immediately Handed Over to Huishan Police Station

The "Zi Lin News" reports that Morrison, a 36-year-old Englishman from the Zhoushan Road branch of the Engineering Department of the Municipal Council, accompanied by interpreter Li Yanmin (transliteration) and a Jewish interpreter, went to the residence of Chinese Ding Xiuchun (transliteration) in Yangshupu for a matter at 2:30 AM yesterday (the 9th). Suddenly, they had an argument with Ding and fought each other. Ding was beaten to death by Li Yanmin, resulting in all three being arrested and detained by the Japanese military authorities in Yangshupu. Upon hearing the news, the Police Department demanded their transfer and finally handed them over to the Huishan Police Station together late last night.

The French "Shanghai Daily" reported on the 10th that a certain foreign employee of the Health Department of the Public Concession and a Jewish refugee, along with a Chinese man, were arrested by Japanese soldiers in Hongkou last night. It is also reported that these three Chinese and foreign individuals were staying at the home of a certain Chinese man residing on Baker Road and had a dispute. The Chinese man was then assassinated, at 2:30 PM. The servant of the Chinese man reported this to the nearby Japanese military station, so the Japanese soldiers detained the three. It is now heard that the Public Concession police will request the extradition of these three people, but the Japanese side has refused the request because the case occurred within the Japanese military defense zone.

### Frequent Fires in Hongkou; Japanese Troops on High Alert

The "News Agency" reports that, according to a Japanese announcement, certain individuals have infiltrated the Japanese military and police defense zone in Hongkou, attempting to set fire to the wharves, warehouses, and ships, disrupting order. Therefore, starting at 2:00 PM yesterday, Japanese troops were dispatched to take emergency precautions, deploying defenses on Yangshupu Broadway Road, Hongkou Small Vegetable Market, North Sichuan Road, and Wenjianshi Road. They implemented strict inspections of passing vehicles and pedestrians, and conducted thorough interrogations. They also searched the households near the Osaka and Huangpu wharves, but it is reported that they found nothing.

### Public Organizations Concerned About People's Livelihood; Hoping Landlords Will Not Take the Opportunity to Raise Rents; Will Jointly Send Letters to All Levels of Courts; To Pay Attention to Landlord Rent Increase Cases

Several public organizations in this city, considering that the prices of everything have skyrocketed recently, and life is generally difficult for the public, some landlords, without understanding the greater good, are taking the opportunity to coerce rent increases, even threatening to cut off water and electricity, resulting in lawsuits. They believe that these incidents are of great importance to the livelihood of citizens and the order and stability of the area. Based on the responsibility of social organizations to maintain local stability and people's morale, they will jointly send letters to the courts of the two special districts and the Jiangsu Higher Second and Third Branch Courts, requesting them to pay attention to lawsuits concerning housing issues and not allow landlords to achieve their rent increase goals through coercive means.

### Fufeng Flour Factory Experiences Labor Unrest; Nine Workers Arrested; Sent to Court on Charges of Intimidation; Arising from Workers' Demand for Wage Increase

The Fufeng Flour Factory on Moganshan Road, West Shanghai, currently has over eight hundred workers, working day and night in shifts. Recently, due to the soaring price of rice and the high cost of living, they believed that their original wages were difficult to maintain. Therefore, on the evening of the 7th, they planned to take action with the management. When Shi Zhuojiang, the factory's worker manager, heard about this, he immediately gathered the workers for a conversation, hoping to quell the brewing labor unrest. However, the conversation ended in a breakdown.

That evening, the factory dismissed nineteen workers and notified the other workers to continue working as usual. The next morning, the dismissed workers gathered outside the factory gate and prevented those going to work from entering. In a short time, laborers gathered like bees outside the factory gate, and the noise and commotion rose up. The factory executives were unable to mediate and reported it to the Putuo Road police station by telephone. West Police Chief Huasheng led Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Zhu Jiahong, Ding Yulin, Sun Benchang, Gui Ziyuan, Zhang Fenglin, Tong Yongxiao, Yang Zezhi, Wang Yunsheng, Cao Tinghong, and other nine workers from northern Anhui. The rest scattered and fled. However, since the 8th, the factory's work has been at a standstill due to the labor unrest. The nine arrested were sent to the First Special District Local Court on Saturday morning (the 9th), where police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a public lawsuit based on Article 304 of the Criminal Code for intimidation. Lawyer Qian explained the situation at the time and said that the workers' request for a wage increase was not a legitimate request. They immediately gathered a crowd, attempting to incite a strike. A detailed investigation is still required, and there are still five ringleaders at large. Therefore, he requested a postponement. Then Shi Zhuojiang arrived in court and explained the details of his negotiations with the workers. After Judge Meng questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be detained and the hearing postponed.

The French police subsequently filed a lawsuit against Dai Qiu and Dai Zhou for theft based on Dai Li's accusation. Qiu and Zhou hired lawyer Ge Zhitan to defend them, insisting that Dai Li had fabricated the accusation. After Judge Huang Yan clarified the case, he ruled yesterday that Dai Qiu and Dai Zhou were both not guilty.

### Headmaster of Juxun Elementary School; Case of Double Appointment; Involved in Public Court Litigation; Adjourned for Further Hearing

Juxun Elementary School, located at No. 32, Cihou South Li, Hartung Road, was founded in the autumn of the 25th year of the Republic of China by Cao Zhinian, also known as Cao Ziying (31 years old this year), who served as headmaster. He was able to fulfill his responsibilities in educating children and was highly praised by the Municipal Education Bureau. In recent years, the internal equipment has become increasingly complete, and there are hundreds of students. Recently, a man named Chen Binzhang filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Cao of embezzling the school. Cao hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to defend him. The case has been ruled by Judge Huang Risheng to suspend the trial. Chen then filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court, requesting confirmation that he was the headmaster of Juxun Elementary School. Yesterday, Judge Gui Yu opened the court to summon and question Cao Zhinian, who was represented by lawyer Ma Junshuo, who said that the plaintiff had no connection with Juxun Elementary School. There is a lot of written evidence that can be used as a reference in court. When the court questioned the plaintiff, Chen Binzhang, he had no evidence. The court reviewed the testimony and ordered that the case be postponed until the plaintiff paid the litigation fees.

### Woman Intends to Renounce Marriage; Man Requests Fulfillment of Marriage Contract

Yu Cheng, a 28-year-old from Wuyuan, Anhui, currently residing at No. 5, Lane 277, Chengdu Road, hired lawyer Zhu Jiaozhuo to represent him in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against his fiancée, Zhan Qiaohong (19 years old, currently residing at Yida Rice Store, Mai Gao Baolu Road, Eight Immortals Bridge), also from his hometown, and her legal representative, her mother, Zhan Zai, requesting fulfillment of the marriage contract and claiming damages, including the loss of betrothal gifts and travel expenses, totaling 2,792 yuan. According to the complaint, both parties were engaged in the countryside on October 26th of the 25th year of the Republic of China.

During the winter of that year, the defendant was kidnapped by bandits. The plaintiff did his best to run around and seek help, and she was rescued. Later, the woman came to Shanghai to open the Deyu Cloth Shop, and she had the plaintiff accompany her to Shanghai to escape. The plaintiff sacrificed his position as the headmaster of the Shichun Elementary School in Wuyuan County for a semester and accompanied the defendant to Shanghai. Later, the plaintiff returned to his hometown and took up a position as a political instructor in the Yubei Section this spring. He received a letter from his mother-in-law, Zhan Wang, urging the plaintiff to come to Shanghai to hold the wedding. The plaintiff came to Shanghai on March 16th and stayed at the Deyu Cloth Shop. Months passed, but there was no news of the wedding. On June 15th, two members of the defendant's clan, Zhan Ruzhang and Zha Jingcheng, claimed to the plaintiff that the defendant did not want to get married and wanted to dissolve the engagement, and they drove the plaintiff out of the Deyu Cloth Shop, not allowing him to stay. Later, they published a newspaper notice saying that the engagement between the plaintiff and the defendant was terminated because "Yu's character is not right, and it is difficult to expect to grow old together." The plaintiff, since his engagement to the defendant, has gone through various difficulties, and it is now so heartless to renounce the marriage, which is unbearable. He sued, requesting that the court order the fulfillment of the marriage contract in accordance with the law and compensate for the losses. Based on the complaint, the court opened the hearing on the morning of the previous day, summoned both parties to examine the case, and both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the case and the object of the request for judgment. The defendant's lawyer argued that the second defendant in this case originally agreed to the marriage, but the first defendant herself extremely opposed it, and the reasons for the opposition were entirely caused by the plaintiff himself. He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected and explained in detail the reasons for the defendant's opposition to the marriage. After reviewing the testimony, the court ordered the lawyers of both parties to notify the parties to attempt a reconciliation and adjourned the case to the morning of the 16th for further hearing.

### Great China Rubber Factory; Workers Demand Improved Treatment; Factory Has Made Considerable Representations; Workers Still Consider Unsatisfactory

The products of the Great China Rubber Factory at No. 1102 Xujiahui Road, mainly overshoes, have been in operation for a considerable history. The business can be said to be thriving. There are a total of more than one thousand eight hundred male and female workers in the factory. Unexpectedly, all the workers suddenly went on strike the day before yesterday (the 8th). The details are recorded below.

Reasons for the Strike

After the "January 28th Incident," the factory used the soaring price of raw materials as an excuse to reduce the meal allowance for male workers by three yuan per person and also reduce the piecework wages for female workers by 25%. Recently, the workers, considering the soaring price of rice and the high cost of living, asked the factory to consider the workers' difficult living conditions and requested to restore the original system. At the same time, they requested the payment of bonuses for the years 26 and 27 of the Republic of China and the early purchase of a large amount of cheap white rice (which the factory prepared to use as relief for workers in times of emergency). Because the price of rice has repeatedly soared and it is not easy to purchase it outside, they also requested the factory to sell it to the workers at a fair price as soon as possible. Therefore, on the 5th of this month, all the workers elected Hu Yunsheng, Xue Jizhong, Shen Zijun, Chen Ziren, Huang Yusen, Tang Jiquan, Xue Jinde, and other seven people as representatives to petition Manager Wu Zhesheng and Factory Director Huang Boqin. Because the matter was delayed and unresolved, the workers decided to go on strike for several hours on the 8th.

Factory's Representation

The factory believes that the workers are using the strike as a means of coercion and that their attitude is very strong. After repeated negotiations with the workers' representatives, they finally agreed to: (1) Increase the rice subsidy for male workers by two yuan per person per month, and also subsidize female workers with wages within 14 yuan by two yuan; (2) Regarding the surplus bonus, each person can borrow one month's wages before the accountant arrives in Shanghai; (3) Each worker can purchase 50 pounds of the rice stored in the factory, limited to once per person; (4) Regarding the workers' representatives Hu Yunsheng and the other seven, they must be transferred to the distribution office to serve and be relieved of their duties in the factory.

Continued Petition

The workers believe that the various terms approved by the factory are not satisfactory. However, in order to maintain order, the representatives instructed a part of the workers to resume work first the day before yesterday (the 9th). At the same time, the representatives continued to petition the factory.

Transportation and Shipping

### General Overview of Chang Hing Company (Part 2)

— Translated by Deng Bingquan, Original by H.B. Beaumont

For many years, European countries (England, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and Portugal) have established a considerable foundation in major Eastern cities through trading companies. Due to trade, transportation between Europe and Asia via the Suez Canal has flourished. Shipping between England, New Zealand, Australia, and Asia via the Suez Canal has also greatly developed. At that time, our company sold joint train and ship tickets for the Pacific, Atlantic, and Canada. If passengers did not want to return via Canada, we sold them tickets for round-the-world trips via the Suez Canal and Canada.

The number of tourists visiting Hawaii, the Orient, and Australia was exceptionally high, which provided our company with an excellent opportunity for development. In 1938, passenger transport between Canada, Hawaii, and Australia increased. As for the Orient, due to the different situation, passenger transport was somewhat inferior. However, in peaceful times, the Orient's tranquil atmosphere, superior environment, and favorable exchange rates gave every tourist advantages that were difficult to obtain elsewhere.

Tourist travel was both individual and in groups, with each group having a leader in charge. Our company, for business needs, had extensive connections with other shipping companies, enabling us to give customers flexibility in their itineraries—allowing them to make long or short stays at any place along the way. Our company offered three different ticket prices to suit the economic capabilities of various tourists.

Secondly, commercial traffic is important because freight and commercial traffic are interconnected, making it very valuable. Missionaries serving abroad had to return home periodically, and new missionaries were sent abroad, either to replace old ones or to be added to foreign stations. Our company handled a large part of this passenger traffic, resulting in intense competition from other shipping companies.

Our company's passenger business in Asia included many Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos traveling between Honolulu and the Orient. For example, Chinese and Japanese people were legally permitted to reside permanently in Canada and the United States or to return to China and Japan for a visit and then come back. Chinese students were also granted temporary permits to study at specialized schools in Canada and the United States. Furthermore, there was a large number of Chinese traveling between the Orient, Havana, the West Indies, and South America. In addition to transporting them across the Pacific, our company also increased its railway business across the continent.

Another source of revenue for our company's Pacific business was what we call transshipment traffic. Among Pacific travelers, those whose destinations were along the ports of call of our company's ships, from the first port to the second, were more numerous than long-distance travelers. The number of these passengers handled by our company was substantial.

Our company's Pacific routes extended as far as Manila, but we had joint transport agreements, so we could directly sell tickets to Singapore, Penang, Colombo, Mumbai, Yangon, Calcutta, and other places. Canadian and Australian shipping companies also had similar joint transport agreements, selling tickets to Durban in South Africa and Cape Town, among other places.

For round trips in the Pacific (Circuit Tours), our company offered various special fares. Passengers could depart from Canada on our company's famous Queen liners to the Orient, then choose any company's ship from the Orient to Australia, and then return to Canada on Canadian-Australian Line ships.

To facilitate travel between San Francisco, Los Angeles, and the Orient, our company had cooperative arrangements with American President Lines and Matson Line. For example, passengers could choose to travel on President Lines or Matson Line ships between the aforementioned cities and Honolulu, while travel from Honolulu was handled by our company's ships. In this way, passengers could save on train fares and time between San Francisco and Los Angeles and Vancouver, Canada, and find it extremely convenient.

Regarding the issue of our company's ship ticket pricing, because of the great differences in the types, tonnage, and routes of various ships, prices had to be set initially on an independent basis. After many years of experience, pricing was adjusted based on competition from other companies and the cost of the ships themselves, reaching the current level. Any proposed changes to current fares had to be handled through the Pacific Passenger Conference. Any shipping company planning to add a new ship, or adding a ship that had not previously sailed on the Pacific, had to report the ship's capacity, type, fare, etc., in detail to the members of the Conference. The Conference's Fare Committee would then hold a meeting to study and set the price, and report to the Conference, contributing their opinions. In short, the pricing of each member shipping company was determined according to the ship's age, tonnage, and speed rating. If the prices of shipping companies competing with our company were lower, it was because the Conference stipulated a lower rating. Conversely, if our company's prices were lower than those of other companies, the reason was the same.

Summarizing this overview of the Pacific passenger transport business, one can imagine our large company's ships as overseas envoys, reflecting the efficiency of the world's largest travel organization abroad. They promote Canada's trade across the seven seas, using various languages among various races to proclaim the company's and Canada's name and reputation throughout the world.

Our company's honor originally came from all colleagues. The deeper the understanding of this important navigational tool, the greater the accumulation of this glory. The continuous economic success of these maritime giants comes from the interest and responsibility of each individual. I hope that every employee, regardless of their position or responsibility, will act cooperatively to increase the success of our maritime enterprise.

Translator's note—The Canadian Pacific (Chang Hing Company) is the world's largest travel organization. Its business is vast, and its transportation tools are unparalleled in the world. Its business scope extends to the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Great Lakes, and the British Columbia Coast, as well as other lakes and rivers. It has 75 giant ships, with a total tonnage of 500,000.

In 1881, several far-sighted people, led by Mr. George Stephen, who was the first general manager of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, were granted the privilege of completing the railway to the Pacific coast within ten years. By 1886, the first train of the Canadian Pacific Company crossed the continent and reached the shores of the Pacific Ocean. The above is the beginning of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.

In the same year, the company was granted permission to operate the clipper "W.B. Flint." Due to business needs, three more ships were added as a result of a request, specializing in passenger and cargo transport, directly from Vancouver to the Far East. Four years later, regular services were opened to handle trans-Pacific business, using the famous Queen ships, namely the "Empress of China," the "Empress of Japan," and the "Empress of India."

The most notable is the current Far East shipping service, with ships such as the Empress of Japan, Empress of Canada, Empress of Asia, and Empress of Russia sailing every two weeks between Manila, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Japan, Honolulu, Victoria, and Vancouver.

The above ships were specially built to meet this need for navigation in various places. Therefore, the famous white Queen liners are the fastest voyages between the Far East and North America.

The Empress of Japan is the crown of the Pacific ships, and is the fastest and largest in the trans-Pacific business.

Special attention is paid to Chinese transportation. Each ship employs more than 500 Chinese staff, not only making it convenient for passengers traveling between Shanghai and Hong Kong, but also for Chinese passengers traveling from the Far East to North America.

The company also owns 21,000 miles of railway in Canada, connecting tourist, industrial, commercial, and agricultural areas. The train equipment is all the latest, and there are streamlined and air-conditioned vehicles.

The company attaches great importance to the proper cooking of meals on the train.

The company has 17 hotels in major Canadian cities and summer resorts, and 9 log cabin camps in the Rocky Mountains and Ontario, providing unparalleled service.

On the Atlantic Ocean, the company has the largest and fastest mail ships, sailing between Canada and England, including one giant Queen ship, four Duchess ships, three "Mont" ships, and five "Beaver" ships.

The largest is the Britannic, with a tonnage of 42,350, with outstanding facilities and spacious accommodations, the crown of any passenger ship in the world. The speed is 24 nautical miles per hour, crossing the Atlantic in just five days. The ship is 760 feet long and 97.5 feet wide. It has an outdoor and an indoor swimming pool, which is also a special advantage, and there is a formal tennis court and a fully equipped gym. The entire air exchange can be done 15 times per hour.

The Queen liners sailing the Pacific Ocean are connected to the magnificent trains traversing Canada, and then connected to the mail ships sailing the Atlantic Ocean. Passengers traveling from the Far East to Western Europe are given the utmost hospitality on the company's ships and trains along the way.

The company also has a vast telegraph network, with telegraph lines 250,000 miles long and 325 miles of submarine cables, communicating with Canada and the world; its wireless radio station is also closely connected with other radio networks in Canada.

There are ten Princess liners traveling between British Columbia and Seattle, Victoria, Vancouver, Alaska, and other major cities on the Northwest coast. There are also three ships carrying passengers and goods between the Great Lakes and Port Mcuicoll, Sault St. Marie, Port Arlbur, and Fort William.

Chang Hing Company's sea, land, and air transportation lines extend to 32,000 miles. There are as many as 8,000 domestic and foreign branches. Travel checks are issued and cashed everywhere, which is very convenient. (End of full text)

### Travel Guide to America

— Inquiry

(3) Accommodation: Finding a house in the United States is not an easy task. Some people have never seen Chinese people and, influenced by movies and magazines, do not rent to them. However, after renting for the first time and seeing that Chinese students do not make trouble or owe rent, they want to find more Chinese people to live there in the future. On the other hand, in some places where there are many Chinese students, the character is uneven, and some people do some disgraceful things, making it difficult for others to find houses in the future. It can be seen that personal behavior is very important.

Ordinary dormitories, private houses, YMCAs, international apartments, hotels, and other long-term residences in the United States mostly have only single rooms. Each room usually houses one, two, or three people, and single rooms are more expensive. Most houses provide bed sheets, pillowcases, towels, and bath towels in addition to furniture and bedding, which are changed once or twice a week. Some places do not provide towels. The house is usually cleaned once a day. Rent is usually calculated on a weekly basis, and sometimes a contract must be signed for at least one semester.

Finding a house depends on each person's choice, but there are a few points to note. Heating or hot air equipment and hot water in winter are, of course, the most important. Being too close to railways and highways is too noisy. The top floor may be too hot in summer if there is no attic. Other factors, such as the direction of the windows and the size of the room, also need to be considered. As for places like dormitories, the equipment is better, and there are fewer problems to consider. Our compatriots often like to talk loudly, which sometimes provokes reactions from others. If several friends come, in addition to being careful yourself, it is best to close the door to avoid disturbing others.

(4) Transportation: What is described here is only the common method of transportation in American cities. The situation is simply described.

Taxis waiting to be hired on the street, in small cities, mostly have the same price regardless of distance. In big cities, it is calculated by distance and time. In addition to designated stops, empty cars running on the street can also be waved down. Major car companies have certain patterns and colors, which are not difficult to recognize at a glance.

Streetcars in the United States are not as popular as buses now, but the price is cheap. Five cents or a dime can take you from one side of the city to the other. Also, the distance between streetcar stops is very short, and you can transfer at intersections without having to buy another ticket. Most streetcar lines in the middle of the street circle out a place called a "safety zone," which is a place for people waiting for the streetcar to dodge cars.

Buses are similar to streetcars, but because they are not restricted by tracks and wires, they have gradually replaced streetcars in recent years. Some big cities have open-air upper levels on buses, where you can sit and browse the scenery, which is not available on other cars.

Most cities such as New York and Boston have underground cars, and Chicago has elevated cars. Because they do not run on the road surface, they do not conflict with cars, streetcars, pedestrians, etc., so the speed of the cars is very high. The price of this type of car is also very cheap, and it is worth it for longer distances. Spending a nickel can take you more than 20 miles.

### Travel Correspondence

Answer to Mr. Lu Shui: (1) To go from Shanghai to Shangrao County in Jiangxi Province, it is most convenient to go via Ningbo. The lowest fare for a ship to Ningbo is 5 yuan and 25 cents. The car fare from Ningbo via Hengzhang to Jinhua is more than 12 yuan. After arriving in Jinhua, you can go directly to Shangrao along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The third-class train fare is more than 5 yuan. In terms of procedures, it is more appropriate to have an identity certificate.

### Discussion on the Staggered Meal System

— Tianxu Wosheng

When I was in Yunnan and Sichuan, I felt that the business of food shops, which served two batches, was a really good opportunity. We outsiders went to fill their gaps, which was just right. I think some places can imitate their system. They eat at nine in the morning and start work at nine thirty, and then eat again after four thirty in the afternoon. There is no meal time in between. Everyone brings some dry snacks to eat at will, which is absolutely free and not forced to stop work; so seven hours of work is actually more productive than eight hours. Although we go to work at nine o'clock, it actually takes half an hour before we can get started and get on the right track, just like a train, running very smoothly; but in just two hours, at half past eleven, we have to prepare to stop work. So when the noon bell rings, it is like the hand chime of a monk, and everyone immediately stands up, disperses, and goes back to eat, and there are inevitably distractions. When we come back to work at one o'clock in the afternoon, it is like a wild horse being domesticated, forced to work until five o'clock. In the half hour before and after that, it is not as good as in the morning. So the so-called eight hours of work is actually only five hours. The most inconvenient thing is that there is a meal time in between, which is not a comfortable rest, but a forced labor, so there are more people suffering from stomach problems. When it is hot summer or cold winter, it is also very wrong to be forced to run around in the scorching sun and rain and snow. If the class time in schools and the office time in banks are changed to a seven-hour system, it would be very beneficial. During these seven hours, everyone can take a five-minute break every two hours and eat some tea and snacks at will, so that they will not be hungry while working. When we went to the examination hall when we were young, we brought four dates with walnut meat, and eating one could last for two hours of hunger, without needing to drink tea. After research, it is very beneficial. It can be seen that the experience of the ancients is also in line with science. If half of the people in an office can voluntarily ask the authorities to allow them to try the staggered meal system, moving two half-hours to the middle to continue working, I think the results of seven hours of work will be impressive. If a school does this, I think the academic performance of this class of students will definitely be much better than average. Friends who eat out can have special gatherings, and food shops can also do a batch of business in their spare time, just like in Sichuan and Yunnan, and they will definitely give special treatment, because the rent and food are not divided.

### The Issue of Light in Residences

— Longju Sheng

Residence and light are inseparable, because the prerequisite for residence, the light issue, is also one of them. If your residence is a narrow, dark room—a house with dark light (because the light is dark, the air is certainly not clean), would you be willing to move your whole family in? Whether it is a large, unparalleled house or a small, lovely house, if the light is dark, it is not very pleasant to move in. Therefore, the first requirement for building a house is sufficient light and air circulation, which is beneficial to the health of the residents. Health and then, saving on medical expenses, benefits to the family economy must be considerable. As the ancient saying goes: "Poor health is better than wealth and honor," it is not an understatement at all. The daylight in the natural world is endless and inexhaustible for us to take and use. "An inch of time is an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time." We should know how to cherish and value the natural light of day.

As for the night, in the homes of wealthy people, it is certainly bright and dazzling, wasting electricity to seek the willful enjoyment of light. However, wealthy households are extremely few, and many ordinary people who occupy the masses are still worried about food and clothing, let alone the willful enjoyment of nighttime light and the burden of huge electricity expenses. After this city was formed into an isolated island, everything soared in price, and the electric lights, which cannot be without for one night, cannot be saved, unless waiting to return to the primitive era, working at sunrise and resting (sleeping) at sunset, in that way, electric lights are not needed. In the midst of this sound of rising electricity prices again (from September, the Public Concession will have to rise by 120% compared to before. The French Concession will rise by 60%, which is quite alarming!), we can only play an economic calculus. I am from the civilian class, so I have to use my brains to think about ways to save electricity. So I went to the electrical store and bought two "Qian Gongwei Economic Electric Lights". After lighting them, not only do they save electricity, but they are also very bright (this light is a patented product with two sizes of light bulbs. The small one is five candle power and can burn for one thousand hours. A light head with a small square shelf can be used for many years). My house originally had to spend four yuan on electricity, but last month it was reduced by half, and I only paid two yuan for electricity. For those who want bright rooms at night and also want to be economical, "economic electric lights" are the best electricity-saving tool.

### Talking about Sweet Potatoes

— Qiu Lang

The last issue of this magazine was a "Noodle Food Movement Special Page", which detailed the cooking methods and benefits of noodles, etc. Now that rice is soaring, changing to eating noodles saves a lot of money. I will talk about sweet potatoes again. Although they cannot be compared with rice and noodles, the selling price is cheaper than flour. In barren places, there are plenty of them to be used as food, and they are sweet, delicious, and glutinous when cooked, which is very suitable for the elderly and children. We can use them for breakfast and afternoon snacks, which is also a way to reduce living expenses.

According to Ciyuan: "Sweet potato is originally named sweet potato, and is commonly called yam. It is a vegetable plant with slender stems and heart-shaped leaves, all of which are purplish-brown. The flowers are similar to morning glories but smaller. The tubers are oval, with sharp ends, purple skin, and red flesh. They taste sweet. In the north, they are called red sweet potatoes and are used as food. Another kind has gray skin and white flesh, and tastes bland. It is a variant of sweet potato." According to Bencao: "Chen Qichang's Records of Strange Objects says that sweet potatoes are produced in the homes of the people in Jiaoguang South. They are planted in February and harvested in October. The roots are like taro. Peeling off the purple skin, the flesh is as white as skin. The southerners use them as rice grains, fruits, steamed and moxibustion are fragrant and beautiful, (taste) sweet, flat, non-toxic, (indications) tonifying deficiency, benefiting qi, strengthening the spleen and stomach, strengthening kidney yin, and the effect is the same as yam", then eating sweet potatoes is not only filling, but also has many benefits, and I have developed a better impression of it!

There are also several ways to eat sweet potatoes; ordinary washing, peeling, and cooking makes them delicious. Or cut them into small squares first, cook them, and mix them with starch, and add osmanthus sugar, which is sweet potato , fragrant and delicious. There are also baked sweet potatoes, which are washed and then baked near the charcoal fire on a iron rack on a charcoal stove. When the skin is half charred, try to pinch it with your finger. If it is warm and soft, take it out, peel it and eat it. It has a special flavor, but it is a pity that the fire is too strong and it is not suitable to eat often! It can also be added to vegetarian dishes, or stir-fried with oil and sauce, which can be used with rice or wine. You can also hang sweet potatoes on the eaves, without being exposed to the sun, so that they are dried by the wind. After peeling and eating raw, they are sweet and refreshing.

However, it is cheaper to buy in large quantities. It is best to have people with the same hobby, jointly wholesale a load or several loads from the local goods store, and everyone will distribute them, which will naturally be much cheaper. If you buy cooked sweet potatoes from street vendors, it is not only expensive, but also may not be very clean. In order to comply with the principles of economy and hygiene, it is specially explained here.

### Oral Fortune and Oral Sin

### Economic Menu for One Week

— Ms. Hua Ying

Recently, everything has soared in price. Rice has risen to more than 30 yuan per load, and the prices of all kinds of meat and vegetable dishes have also risen by one or more times. My economic menu signboard has been broken with one punch. It used to be enough to have a sample of meat and vegetable dishes for six or seven cents, but now it costs one yuan or one yuan and twenty cents. Pork used to be able to buy more than two pounds for one yuan, but now it is only one pound. Comparatively speaking, beef is still cheaper, and it is also richer in vitamins, so it is okay to eat it every other day during the week. However, stir-fried beef is often easy to become old and not tender. Here is a secret that I will share with readers: After cutting the beef, first mix it with soy sauce and arrowhead powder, and soak the beef in it. After soaking for about an hour, it will be tender and will not become old whether it is stewed, braised, or stir-fried. There are many different ways to cook beef, which are as complicated as pork. The most common ones are curry beef, celery stir-fried beef shreds, and onion stir-fried beef shreds. Some more unique ones are yellow soybeans braised in soy sauce with beef, fermented bean curd braised beef, tomato cabbage potato beef soup (i.e. borscht in Russian restaurants), and mashed potato beef patties, which are all very delicious. If you want to save some rice, then using them to make noodles is also suitable, please readers consider it yourself.

### The Residence of Hitler, the War Maniac

— Han

Mentioning Hitler's name, everyone's mind will conjure up a "peach"-shaped lock of hair on his forehead, and the image of a monster who has revitalized Germany in just six years and is now threatening Europe. According to common sense, such a nation-building figure should live in the most exquisite Western-style house in Berlin. However, the reality is quite the opposite; he actually lives on a desolate mountain cliff.

Hitler is fond of solitude and detests city life. When the National Socialist Party was just starting, he based himself in Munich, Bavaria (a state in southern Germany), but he himself hid in a small village house at the foot of the Alps. This place is 1,500 feet higher than the urban area of Berchtesgaden. In this crude house, he planned various attacks on German democracy. When he became Chancellor, he moved his headquarters to Berlin, but he expanded this place into Berchtesgaden, transforming it into Germany's famous "mountain chalet." Like Mecca for Muslims, National Socialist Party members stood in droves outside his wooden house shouting, "We want to see the Führer!" (meaning Hitler). Thus, this "chalet" still could not bring him peace and solitude. Therefore, in the first half of last year, he decided to climb further up the Alps.

He took a fancy to a piece of land on the treacherous slopes of the summit of the Kehlstein mountain in the Alps. He decided to penetrate the bottom of the peak and drill out the top to build his "paradise" in that inaccessible place. Engineers and mechanics accepted his plan and worked for several months to build him a "residence" made of steel and glass—no, it's simply an eagle's nest. Only an elevator provides access. The road leading to the entrance, built into the mountain, is guarded more strictly than the vaults of the Bank of England. He did not want any more of those "brave mountaineers" shouting, "We want to see the Führer!" on the jagged cliffs around his villa.

These constructions were completed during the September crisis last year. But Hitler did not want many people to know about it. He forbade domestic newspapers from publishing this news and details, and even forbade his closest photographers from taking pictures.

Whenever he has the opportunity, he goes to that villa, 5,500 feet above sea level, to admire the snow-covered valleys and peaks beneath his feet from the small glass pavilion. Berlin is really driving him crazy, because his solitary personality is extremely strong.

In the summer, he takes a plane to Munich, and in the winter, he takes his private train. From Munich, his powerful Mercedes-Benz car speeds him to Salzburg, and then from there, he drives along the mountain road carved out of rock that circles the German Alps to Berchtesgaden. After passing the Berchtesgaden chalet, it's another five miles of winding roads to reach it.

If you go with him, you will immediately see two very large bronze gates, which slowly open as Hitler's car approaches. The car drives straight into the large cave at the foot of the Kehlstein mountain, all the way to the elevator. The cave is dome-shaped, inlaid with unpolished marble, 130 yards long and 20 feet wide, and has a very large space for parking many cars. As for the elevator, it is also magnificent, inlaid with copper wires and equipped with carpeted seats. You can sit comfortably with Hitler and ascend 400 feet to reach the summit.

This villa can accommodate eighteen people, is completely painted white, and has simple Bavarian farmer-style furniture, ready for tea and Hitler's favorite dishes. If you run close to the large window, you will definitely feel dizzy, because the small glass room is built on the edge of a cliff. From here, you can see the scenery in all directions, the mountainous Berchtesgaden, and the snow-covered Alps all around.

It is in this snowy, solitary environment that Hitler has decided on all major national affairs and countermeasures, and has stirred up two or three astonishing waves.

Once, a certain Englishman, who was accompanied by him on a visit, jokingly asked Hitler after returning:

"What if the elevator happens to stop at any point in the 400 feet?"

"Then, I think," Hitler said with a smile, "the history of the world will only be suspended for two hours!"

Spring and Autumn

### A Report on the Lives of the Poor: Cow Dung Balls

— (Mu Xu)

Near Panjiaku on Dunxin Road in West Shanghai, there is an open space of two mu (approximately 1/3 of an acre), where stagnant water has not dried up and weeds grow wildly. This is where the Shanghai Milk Company exclusively piles cow dung.

The Shanghai Milk Company raises nearly a hundred Dutch cows, and the amount of manure they produce every day piles up like small mounds. However, after being dumped on that open space for a short time, it is all gone. At first, I suspected that people were transporting it away to use as fertilizer. Then I thought, in Shanghai, fertilizer is not only worthless but you have to pay to get rid of it. The example of disposing of night soil is a clear example.

One time, when the morning sun was just rising and the dew had not yet dried, I took advantage of the cool early autumn and passed by there. I saw several poorly dressed men and women, and bare-chested children in shorts, competing to scoop up golden-yellow cow dung from the pile and put it into bamboo baskets or kerosene cans. Sweat hung on their faces, but they had no intention of wiping it away. After a while, two of them, who looked like father and son, happily returned home fully loaded.

I wanted to solve this mystery, so I followed them from a distance. When they reached the open space near the First Shelter on Dunxin Road, they stopped to unload the cow dung. After resting for a moment, they bent down and carefully picked up the cow dung from the small bamboo baskets, making them into spherical shapes one by one, scattered across the ground like stars.

"What is this for?" I asked.

"Cow dung balls are used for burning fires, along with straw. They are no worse than coal balls!"

"Can this be burned? Wouldn't its odor make it impossible to even eat the food?"

"If you dry it in the sun and loosen it up, it won't smell, and the heat is very strong!"

"Do you also make it to sell?" I asked him again.

"That's right, we sell it. Three rice bags of cow dung balls can be exchanged for one yuan. After the price of firewood and charcoal soared, it's still not enough to sell. A certain church wants to buy ten yuan's worth right now, but we don't have enough to deliver, so we're rushing to produce more!" He smiled proudly.

"How many cow dung balls can you make every day?"

"On a sunny day, we can produce about one yuan's worth. On a cloudy day, we can't do anything."

Finally, based on his experience, he reported that burning cow dung balls consumes less than half the price of burning firewood and charcoal. It is said that in this corner of West Shanghai, there are thirty to forty families who make a living from this. Cow dung is originally waste, but the poor who are struggling below the starvation line are actually utilizing it, on the one hand, to replace expensive firewood and charcoal, and on the other hand, to maintain a minimum standard of living. Their work, despite being dirty and humble, makes a considerable contribution to society and the family.

### Mr. Chen Zhuzun's Calligraphy

### A Day of Teaching in a Lane Primary School

— Leng Yan (Cold Eyes)

The other day, I received a phone call from my friend Mr. Wang, who, due to some business, could not go to school and asked me to substitute for a day at ×× Road ×× Primary School. Partly out of consideration for his friendship and partly because I was idle anyway, I agreed. So, the day before, Mr. Wang introduced me to the school's "Economic Trustee"—the current principal of several lane primary schools—to meet. The next morning, I went to the school with high spirits. The school consisted of three two-story buildings, all painted in a temple-like, non-temple style, in yellow and blue. Outside the gate, it was prominently written, "Register Quickly," "Low Tuition Fees." At the entrance was a room similar to a reception room, but actually a school store. Sitting inside was a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy, whom I thought was a school employee. Who knew that this trustee actually asked him, "Is your father home?" How dare I! It turned out to be the principal's son!

Inside, we went straight to the side room upstairs. The back half was the classroom, and the front small half was the principal's office. Further inside was the principal's bedroom. It was almost 8:30, but the principal had not yet come to the office. The students had almost all arrived, but classes were said to start at nine o'clock. I regretted coming so early. The trustee was busy and left first, so I had to sit in the principal's office and wait blankly. Around 9:15, the great principal finally came out from the bedroom to meet me, saying that he would inform me when classes were about to start.

But strangely, it was said that school had started on August 20th, but now it was almost mid-September, and even the students' seats had not been arranged yet, let alone the official start of classes. The school was a complete primary school, and there were many teachers, but the principal had to do everything himself. Today, he actually called the roll and arranged the classes himself, grade by grade. The class arrangement had to be done in the courtyard, so one grade left and then another grade came, making it slow and quite disorderly. It took from 9:30 to 12:00 to complete this. Had I known that he would be arranging until 12:00, I would have left earlier. He didn't inform me until then that classes would start promptly at 1:00 in the afternoon, so I had no choice but to come again in the afternoon.

Heaven knows! Even the timetable had not been arranged! When I came in the afternoon, the first class was not my class, so I had to sit in the reception room downstairs, which was connected to the classroom, and observe the teaching. Several children were crying and refusing to come to class, so four or five teachers each grabbed a half-inch-thick ruler and dragged them into the room with a menacing attitude. The sound of slapping hands was constantly coming from the next room. Using corporal punishment in this era, such education is really chilling. Have these "teachers" not even flipped through a book on simple normal school education?

The second class was in my assigned classroom, which happened to be outside the principal's office. So, people came and went, old women, children, the principal's wife, plasterers, carpenters, all passed through without hindrance. After teaching for an hour, my throat was itchy and sore. Fortunately, the next class was the end of the day, so I escaped as if granted amnesty, and took a deep breath outside.

### Letter from the Qingzhong Cooperative Society

— (Zhang)

Editor Sir:

I am writing to inform you that a group of students from the Qingnianhui Middle School, in order to practice thrift, established a cooperative society and an attached used book exchange (which ended many days ago). We have not solicited or canvassed from the outside world. Today, I read the article "Qingnianhui Establishes Used Book Discount Store" in your column, and after reading it, I was shocked and confused. Our society did not "hope that other students (regardless of school) would provide a lot of help and guidance." Since this article was published, quite a few students from other schools have come to our school and cooperative society to inquire, causing a lot of misunderstandings. The author of this article has not yet confirmed whether he or she is a student of our school. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future and to apologize to the students of other schools, I am writing to correct this as above. I wish you well. Qingzhong Cooperative Society

Chapter Fifteen: Overseas Scandal Suddenly Emerges Like Peach Leaves, Miraculous Scene in the Fire Is Actually a Lotus Flower

He Liyu said, "If that's the case, will the future Free Village become an industrial zone? I thought that the Wu culture was refreshing and pleasant here, making it most suitable for living, so my father wanted us to choose a place here to build houses. You say that the residential area and the industrial area are close, is there any problem?" Zhu Airen laughed and said, "I'm just talking casually, you can't test me! So people in the Free Village often say that they are limited to light industry, also because they are afraid that some industries will harm the people's living. Now some of the newly emerging large industries in China often occupy thousands of mu of land, often in originally barren and desolate places with no human habitation. Since the opening up of these places, they have become prosperous. Their markets and local administration are all established based on this large industry, which is another matter. The industries that will be developed in the Free Village in the future will all be light industries, small industries, or semi-manual industries, or industries close to art and culture. Therefore, they do not interfere with living, or even complement each other. There is also one thing, I think there are really too many residents in Shanghai now, and the factories are all crowded in Shanghai, so they must be dispersed. Dispersing from Shanghai means going to the cities and towns and villages near Shanghai. Then, villages like the Free Village will naturally be affected by it." The He sisters felt that what Zhu Airen said was not without reason. They thought that Airen usually only cared about the affairs of a certain pregnant woman and a certain baby, and did not pay much attention to local affairs, especially the affairs of the Free Village. Now hearing her say it, it was all very logical. It can be seen that the common knowledge of women has also improved compared to before. This time, the two Miss He went to Shanghai, and there was another thing that they wanted to discuss on the way, which was to build a factory building, hire an engineer, and prepare all the drawings and designs. Isn't there a ready-made engineer, Mr. Lin Jiancheng, the groom who is going to the wedding banquet this time? It wouldn't hurt to talk to him about this business deal at the wedding banquet. It's just that they are busy, and after the wedding, I don't know if they will have a honeymoon trip. I heard that Jin Danyun was given a month's leave by the superior organization. Lin Jiancheng will naturally also take a month's leave during this newlywed period. During their honeymoon, they can go to various places to spend their sweet years, who can be busy drawing and designing for us? Fortunately, we have plenty of time to prepare, so it wouldn't hurt to talk to him in advance. It is said that

Don't say that the phoenix has changed nests, but ask when the mandarin ducks will come. (180)
