### Japanese Troops in Tianjin Confiscate Civilian Legal Tender

(Tianjin) Japanese troops are currently searching Chinese and foreign people at the entrance of the former German concession to see if they are carrying legal tender, but are not searching other locations in Tianjin. If Chinese people are found carrying legal tender, the legal tender is confiscated, but the people are released. No foreigners have been found carrying legal tender. Although the authorities have announced that anyone found carrying legal tender will be fined and their assets confiscated, violators have not been punished. Banks and exchange shops in Tianjin have been searched, but the method they take seems to be only confiscating the legal tender found. (16th Reuters dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Using Poison Gas: Conclusive Evidence Exists; Chinese Army Obtains Two Documents Detailing Methods of Using Poison Gas

(Chongqing) In October of last year, the Chinese army obtained two documents detailing the Japanese use of poison gas in De'an Dunshang. Both documents were from the "China Expeditionary Army Headquarters." One was the "Examples and Results of Special Smoke Use in the Xuzhou Campaign and Anqing Operations," printed in July of Showa 13 (1938), and the other was "How to Use Special Smoke Tubes and Special Smoke Bombs," printed in August of Showa 13 (1938). The former document explained the examples and results of their use of poison gas, and the latter explained the methods of its use. The main points are summarized as follows: The Japanese-used gas smoke tubes were only effective for 30 minutes. After the smoke tubes were released, poison gas must be released continuously. After the poison gas is spread, the assault must begin immediately in order to obtain the effective results of the gas. The first document also cited examples of the successful use of gas. The document stated that the Japanese were unable to capture Guzhen on May 18th and 19th and suffered a fierce counterattack from the Chinese army. The Japanese army, seeing the situation as dangerous, used it in large quantities. Gas was also used in the Battle of Xiangkou on June 2nd. Later, in the battles of Madang and Liushiqiao, when the Chinese army began to counterattack and the Japanese army was unable to resist, they used gas in large quantities again. In addition, on the Shanxi battlefield, such as in the battles of Jiyuan and Wenxi, gas was used as much as possible. Each time, the Chinese army lost its combat power due to the Japanese army's indiscriminate use of gas and suffered defeat. Therefore, whenever the Japanese encountered attacks that they could not win or were unable to resist the Chinese army's counterattacks, they used gas in large quantities, which always had an effect. Therefore, the Japanese side encouraged and taught its troops how to use it. The document also detailed the points to be noted when using gas: (1) All kinds of smoke tubes must be tightly sealed. (2) After use, the smoke tubes and gas cylinders must be thrown into the river or buried in the ground and must not be exposed. (3) Do not use it in areas where foreigners reside. (4) Tests must be conducted indoors, and the poisonous smoke must not be allowed to escape. It was also said that in the past, there had been incidents of soldiers being injured and killed due to improper use, and that improvements must be made in the future to prevent abuses. In order to release poison gas, the Japanese army carried a large number of gas masks, but for the sake of cover, they claimed to be defending against the Chinese army's use of poison gas. This kind of counter-propaganda only shows their foolishness. (16th dispatch)

(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesperson presented two booklets on the Japanese army's use of poison gas at a reception for foreign journalists today, proving that the Japanese army did indeed use large quantities of poison gas in Bengbu Guzhen and other places during the attack on Xuzhou last summer. Generally, before releasing poison gas, the Japanese army first released a smokescreen, first tested the wind direction, and at the same time used the smokescreen as cover, put on gas masks, and advanced towards the Chinese army's front line. According to this booklet, the release of poison gas should be avoided in areas where foreigners reside. The booklet also stated that this booklet was a military secret, so after reading it, it should be buried in the ground or thrown into the river to prevent the leakage of secrets. According to the booklet, the results of the Japanese army's use of poison gas were most satisfactory last summer, and the Japanese army was ordered to release poison gas at any time and in any place in accordance with the prescribed methods.

### Rumor: Government to Issue Construction and Military Bonds Totaling 1.2 Billion Yuan, Subscriptions to Begin April 1st

(Chongqing) The Chinese government has decided to issue public bonds worth 1,200,000,000 yuan (Chinese currency), and subscriptions will begin on April 1st. This public bond will be approved by the Supreme National Defense Council and will be divided into two types: "Construction Bonds" and "Military Bonds," each worth 600,000,000 yuan. The purpose of both is to enhance the government's ability to continue the war of resistance. According to authoritative government sources, the value of this public bond will be equal to its face value and is scheduled to be repaid in 30 years. The interest rate has not yet been disclosed. Financial circles here are very optimistic about this public bond. (16th Huitong News Agency dispatch)

### Bai Chongxi Speaks to Cultural Circles: The Work of Cultural Figures Is No Less Than That of Brave Soldiers Shedding Blood; Regardless of Rank, Everyone Must Be Willing to Die, and We Will Never Be Conquered by Other Countries

Guilin: Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Military Affairs Commission, hosted a reception for cultural circles on the 14th. Over eighty people including Ma Junwu, Li Siguang, and others attended. During the banquet, Bai delivered a speech, the main points of which were that the nature of this war against Japan is one of resistance and response. We are in a semi-colonial position, and the way to win depends on total war, fighting the enemy in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. The work of cultural figures, although biased towards the rear, is no less helpful to the war of resistance than that of brave soldiers shedding blood at the front. Since the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the enemy has not been as aggressive militarily as before. It is clear that their intention is to establish puppet regimes in our guerrilla areas and engage in economic aggression. Therefore, in the second phase of the war of resistance, we have decided to adopt a defensive posture militarily and an offensive posture politically. At the Fifth Plenary Session, it was decided to establish the Supreme National Defense Council and the Party and Government Committee, in order to make political facilities flexible in their operation and to strengthen political institutions in the guerrilla areas, and then to implement counter-lock policies with military and political forces to crush the enemy's economic aggression attempts. As for areas along the Yangtze River such as Nanchang and Changsha, it is not impossible for the enemy to advance further, but the gains and losses of one point or one line have little to do with the future of the war of resistance. As for the northwest, although the enemy claims to attack Lanzhou and take Xi'an, the success of our comprehensive tactics in Shanxi makes it predictable that the enemy's ambitions will be difficult to achieve. As for the southwest, we are not afraid of the enemy's attack, but we are afraid of the enemy's failure to advance. The land and manpower of Guangdong and Guangxi alone are more than enough to attack the enemy. As long as the Chinese people can build a sound mentality, not be afraid, not retreat, and be willing to die regardless of rank, we will never be conquered by other countries. (15th dispatch)

Editorial

### A Fair Discussion of the Shanghai Concession's Security Problem

Over the past month, the Shanghai concessions have re-emerged with a state of anxiety; and this has become increasingly worse in recent days. All kinds of rumors are alarming to hear, and at first it was not possible to verify them all. Upon closer investigation, the truth and falsehood each make up half of them. If all the rumors were completely unfounded, the public's suspicion and fear would still be enough to lead people to unease, let alone the fact that half of them are true, which makes people feel uneasy as if they cannot live another day. In all fairness, the Shanghai concessions are neither a paradise on earth nor a heavenly palace in this world; nor are they a strong military fortress that cannot be breached; nor do they have strong security that cannot be violated. With half of China's territory falling under violent aggression, is it any wonder that Shanghai, as a small place, is known for its anxiety?

Who would want to destroy Shanghai? I believe that no one wants to destroy it.

Who can destroy Shanghai? I believe that no one cannot destroy it.

Only because no one wants to destroy it, it has managed to remain mostly intact like it is today, through mutual forbearance from all sides, despite the repeated hardships. Without mutual forbearance, it will inevitably collapse. The anxiety and unease are probably signs of collapse; however, is this the original wish of all parties? It is extremely easy to destroy Shanghai if one wishes to do so. If the initial wish is not like this, then it is hoped that all parties will bravely reflect and carefully examine themselves.

Shanghai's unease has its distant causes and its major environmental causes, which will not be discussed in detail here. As for its immediate causes, assassinations have occurred one after another in the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Japanese-controlled areas, almost creating a scene of terror. In all fairness, in these chaotic times, anything beyond the norm can happen. Whether the reason is political strife, emotional disputes, monetary disputes, sexual disputes, or the fight for position and reputation, a murderous intention can easily be aroused. Now that none of the cases have been solved, there is no way to know the nature of any of them, and even less way to know whether the cases are linked or have any common characteristics. Therefore, any speculation or any conclusion is too early and lacks sufficient evidence. In all fairness, what country or place does not have murder and robbery? The responsibility lies with the concession if it happens in the concession, and with the district if it happens in the district. Responsibility should be assigned where it belongs, but each has its limits and should not be deliberately favored or belittled. Unfortunately, Shanghai is not like this, and Shanghai's unease is even worse. As a result, there are indirect attacks in diplomacy and military affairs, and direct confrontations in protests and agreements. How did it come to this? The entire pathological state of Shanghai is due to innate factors, acquired factors, distant causes, immediate causes, and even a common concept, namely, regarding the phenomenon as terror and seeking to deal with terror.

I wonder if there is anyone in the world who approves of terror? But it can be said with certainty that there is no one in the world who approves of terror of an unclear nature. Therefore, if the concession authorities take measures to curb terror, one can at least approve of them as acting in accordance with their duties, putting oneself in their position. However, what does the response to the measures seem to be? If the motivation is indeed to curb terror, does the objective fact not create another kind of terror? Otherwise, why would they cut off traffic to conduct inspections, barge into homes and search them, make public arrests, carry out kidnappings in plain clothes, offer rewards for arrests, and cause disappearances? What seems to be the extent of the terror that this causes among the general population, and how widespread and deep is it?

Setting aside all emotions and addressing the issue based on the situation and the location, I believe that the governance of the Shanghai concessions must establish strict and clear methods that are suitable for the actual situation. Otherwise, multiple collisions will eventually lead to destruction. This is not alarmist rhetoric, but an inevitable trend. For example, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has repeatedly made statements at a time when all parties are feeling uneasy: one says that the Municipal Council's police power remains intact, the second says that the Land Regulations are the basis of everything, and the wording of the "Cooperation Measures" is also grand and impressive. However, this is not enough to correct the facts of unease, nor is it enough to dispel the rumors of unease, let alone remedy what has already happened and prevent what has not yet happened. Why is this? It is a serious violation of the iron rules of political administration and the mistaken belief that ambiguity can lead to a temporary peace, while strictness is the only way to achieve good governance.

To say strictness in response to the current unease means that the goal should be to maintain the public order of the concessions and protect the safety of residents' lives. Certain strictly prohibited areas should be defined, and no violations should be tolerated. Certain mandatory procedures should be formulated, and no deviations should be allowed. For example, searching for weapons is permissible, but it should never extend to pieces of paper; prohibiting political activities is permissible, but it should never involve national flags; severely punishing illegal activities is permissible, but it should never punish the innocent, and the innocent must be protected; even if the guilty are interrogated, sentenced, executed, or even killed, there should be no such thing as disappearance without a trace.

The foundation of the concessions today lies not in international guarantees, but in the safety within the concessions! The foundation of safety lies not in regulations and clauses, but in mutual forbearance and adherence to a strict and clear path!

### Germany's Ambition Knows No Bounds; Small Countries in Central Europe Live in Fear; Romania Expresses Determination to Defend Its Territory; Yugoslav Public Holds Anti-German Demonstrations; Memel Will Suffer the Same Fate as Czechoslovakia

(New York) The New York Times recently stated that Hitler has broken the only army between Berlin and the Danube that could resist his invasion plans. His robber-like tactics in the world have taught the small countries of Central Europe a lesson, and have revealed the value of the Nazi Party's promises and Germany's true intentions to the world. (16th Reuters dispatch)

(Berlin) After German troops entered Czechoslovakia, it is widely rumored here that the German leader of the Memel Autonomous Region in Lithuania will issue a declaration tomorrow demanding that the region be incorporated into German territory and requesting protection from Führer Hitler. At the same time, there are similar rumors about the future fate of the Free City of Danzig. (15th Havas dispatch)

Lithuanian Capital: Neumann, the leader of the Germans in Memel, today summoned members of the Memel Parliament and told them that in view of the new situation in Central Europe, he felt he could take the actions he deemed necessary without consulting the Parliament. This openly revealed the ambitions of the Memel Germans. Neumann made a speech at the end of January this year, saying that the Memel Germans were organized and powerful, and that nothing could stop them from moving towards freedom. (15th Reuters dispatch)

Romanian Capital: The Romanian government newspaper announced today, "Romania is determined to defend the rights guaranteed by the peace treaties obtained in the World War. Romanian territory belongs to Romanian farmers, who are willing to protect their property with artillery. King Carol II's plan to promote military expansion is to encourage Romanian farmers so that they will not be discouraged by the lack of military equipment. Although the Romanian people desire peace, they are willing to make any sacrifice for the integrity of their territory, the honor of their nation, and their future." (16th Huitong dispatch)

Yugoslav Capital: A fierce anti-German demonstration took place last night in the central square here. Hundreds of demonstrators shouted "Down with Hitler" and "Down with Germany" continuously. When police officers entered the square to try to suppress the demonstration, the crowd sang the Yugoslav national anthem. The demonstration began a few hours after the news of the German invasion of Czechoslovakia arrived, and the situation became even more tense after news was confirmed that Yugoslav troops had taken military measures on the northern border.

### British Prime Minister Condemns Germany for Violating the Spirit of the Munich Agreement; Believes This Act Further Increases International Turmoil; Eden Warns the Government Not to Continue Its Self-Delusion

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on the Central European events in the House of Commons this afternoon. The House was packed, and everyone listened quietly. When Chamberlain entered the chamber, the government party cheered to welcome him, while the opposition party jeered. The Prime Minister began by saying that the British government had recently been working to establish a guarantee agreement with the governments of other countries that participated in the Munich Conference, but had ultimately failed. Therefore, the government now believes that its guarantee obligations are no longer binding. After presenting the facts as he knew them, he made the following statements: (1) The guarantee given to Czechoslovakia last October has become invalid due to the disintegration of Czechoslovakia. (2) The Bank of England has been ordered to stop continuing to pay the Czech government 10 million pounds in debt. (3) British Trade Minister Stanley and Overseas Trade Minister Hudson's visit to Berlin will not take place. After announcing the above three items, the Prime Minister turned to discussing the policy of the Munich settlement, saying that at the time he had considered that the only alternative was war, so he firmly believed that the path taken by the British government was correct and believed that the majority of world opinion supported it. However, this settlement has not reached its final stage, and Czechoslovakia, which Britain hoped to give a more solid future, has disintegrated. He does not believe that what Germany is doing now was intended by any of the signatories to the Munich agreement at the time. The Munich agreement was a solution, and he cannot recognize that the way in which today's changes are being made is not incompatible with the Munich agreement. For the first time, Germany is now occupying with military force a nation with no ethnic ties to Germany. This will certainly cause disruption to the international situation and cause the trust that has just been revived to fall. He has repeatedly heard accusations of breaking faith, but in his view, there does not seem to be sufficient basis. Even today, he is still unwilling to agree with such accusations. However, he has to say that he cannot believe that what is currently happening was intended by any of the signatories to the Munich agreement. The Munich agreement was a way to solve the Czech problem that was accepted by both the strong and Czechoslovakia. It stipulated the future demarcation of the boundaries and limited the German occupation. All of this was acknowledged by the German government. As far as he knows, Germany did not notify the other three signatories before sending troops across the border that was stipulated at that time. Even if Germany claims that it obtained the Czech government's consent, he cannot recognize that the way in which this change is being made is in accordance with the spirit of the Munich agreement. There is one more point he cannot avoid mentioning. In the past, when the German government expanded its military administration, it always claimed to be bringing the German people in neighboring areas back to Germany. But today it has begun to militarily occupy the land inhabited by people who have no ethnic ties to Germany at all. In late August of last year, he gave a speech in Birmingham asking other countries to make contributions to seeking peace, so he is deeply saddened by today's events. However, Britain cannot change its path because of this. It must be understood that the wishes of the people of the world are still focused on peace and the restoration of an atmosphere of understanding and goodwill. The British government's purpose has always been to promote this desire and to seek to resolve disputes through discussion rather than force. Although it has suffered repeated setbacks and disappointments, the British government's purpose is so important to the happiness of mankind that it cannot be easily abandoned.

### Opposing Parties Sternly Denounce the Government

Following the British Prime Minister's speech, Labour Party member Mr. Greenwood began the debate, stating that this was a day of disgrace and shame for Britain. Britain had abandoned truth, condoned force, and championed strength over reason and justice. He believed that the complex issues of Central Europe should be subjected to more careful research and more complete understanding, rather than the superficial explanation offered by the Prime Minister. He found it strange that the Prime Minister made statements in response to a situation full of emotional stimuli that contained a bizarre, isolated, and unconnected consciousness. Now that dignity has been debased and the trust and independence of a country have been destroyed, the Prime Minister, with his simple mind, still says that the Munich agreement was born out of good faith. Czechoslovakia is now occupied in a way that is no different from if it had been occupied without the Munich Conference. This matter is only one of the consequences suffered by Europe in the past, and this crisis will surely recur at the appropriate time in the future, because the British government has not grasped the true meaning of European events in the past few years. He knew that nothing could be done after the Munich Conference, but before the Munich Conference, the British government could not shirk its responsibility for failing to cope with the situation. Last October, British cabinet members still said that under the Munich Agreement, Czechoslovakia would enjoy greater security than before. The Prime Minister's gullibility towards false words is incomprehensible. The current reality is that the world has entered a period full of immediate and terrible dangers. There is no security in Europe, and small countries are in a state of worry and panic, and even large countries are not immune. He urged the government to quickly find a way to gather the peace-loving forces of Europe and the world to carry out a cooperative plan, and not to procrastinate any longer, lest it be too late to regret. Liberal Party leader Mr. Sinclair then spoke, saying that he believed that the secret aggression used by the Hitler government in Czechoslovakia would also be used elsewhere. He also hoped that the Prime Minister would gather countries with the same aspirations, under the guidance of Britain, to jointly maintain the legal principles in international relations. Former Foreign Secretary Mr. Eden rose to speak amidst cheers, saying that the nature of Germany's actions was unquestionable. As far as he knew, there was no evidence to support the so-called abuse of the German minority in Czechoslovakia. Germany neither negotiated with the Czechoslovak government nor consulted with the British and French governments. According to the Munich Agreement, if the matter was urgent, Germany should have contacted Britain and France. Now, it is difficult to reach a conclusion about avoiding abuse. Even if there were indeed cases of abuse, it cannot be a reason for sending troops to occupy the country. He asked whether the members of the House of Commons now believe that after this incident, they can regain a short period of respite without seeing the continuation of demands, the recurrence of sacrifices, and the re-invasion of land under conditions of resistance or surrender. A situation where international moral standards are rapidly declining is already before us. He firmly believes that if the current method is allowed to continue without being stopped, then the world will fall into a universal tragedy. He earnestly hoped that all parties in Britain would cooperate to show the world the strength and unity of the country, and its unprecedented determination. Only such a government united by all parties can study the new military and strategic position, and consult with allied countries in any place and with any political system to determine what should be their common policy, where their position should be, and how they should implement their decisions. Once what should be done has been decided, military steps should be taken to implement the decisions. When the great powers of the world have the opportunity to make major plans, he believes that this opportunity is today. He also believes that only in this way can the current panic of the British people be eliminated. Mr. Eden expressed admiration for the courage, glory, and patience of the Czech people in this new hardship, and supported the requests made by Mr. Greenwood and Mr. Sinclair that the British government urgently take measures to provide relief and protect the status of refugees in Czechoslovakia. Mr. Eden inquired about the visit of the Overseas Trade Minister to Warsaw, Moscow, and Helsinki in the near future. The Prime Minister replied that the government did not want to cancel the above three trips. The crowd cheered upon hearing this. (Reuters, March 15)

### Tokyo Newspapers Comment on the European Situation

(Tokyo) The Hochi Shimbun stated that after Germany has established a solid foundation in Czechoslovakia, the path to advance to Ukraine has been opened. Japan will definitely be able to gain a lot from Hitler's policy of dominating Central Europe within a year. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that the principle of national self-determination was invented by the Allied countries such as Britain and France during the European War to disintegrate the Austro-Hungarian Empire and create the Czechoslovak Republic. Now Hitler has successfully handled this doctrine with clever means, which is admirable. The Kokumin Shimbun declared that the day Germany completes its activities in Romania will be the time when it begins to advance into Ukraine. The newspaper further pointed out the possible routes for Germany to advance into Ukraine as follows: (1) through Romania, (2) via Poland, and (3) via the Baltic countries. The newspaper believed that since Hungary has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, there will be no serious disputes between Hungary and Germany over Ruthenia. The newspaper further pointed out that the existence of the Anti-Comintern Pact and the lessons that the Soviet Union has given Japan on the Sino-Japanese War and fishery issues urged the entire country of Japan not to turn a blind eye to the Czech problem, and said that Germany, Italy, and Japan should establish close friendship and form a military alliance to help Germany smoothly realize its eastward advance, and help Italy dominate the Mediterranean.

### The Fall of Czechoslovakia Shakes the United States - Russian Newspaper Discusses the Central European Situation - New Conflicts are Brewing

(New York) After German troops occupied major cities in Czechoslovakia, people from all walks of life in the United States were shocked because the country was a pillar of the democratic system in Central Europe, and its founding had a deep connection with the United States (Note: Czech founding father Mr. Masaryk signed an agreement with Slovakia in Pittsburgh, USA, declaring the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic). The New York Times also commented, "German leader Hitler has now acquired colonies in Central Europe, and the day when his plan to dominate Central Europe will be realized is getting closer." (Havas, March 15)

(Washington) After German troops occupied Moravia and Bohemia, the diplomatic relations between the United States and Czechoslovakia remained unchanged. The Czech ambassador to the United States may notify the State Department that the country's government has decided to merge into Germany, because the same procedure was adopted when Germany and Austria merged last March. The Czech Republic will probably follow the precedent. If so, the US government may recognize it without violating the Stimson Doctrine (the doctrine of recognizing military conquest). As for the agreement that the US previously signed with the Czech Republic last year, it will inevitably be abolished. Czech goods imported into the United States will be regarded as German goods and will be subject to additional tariffs. (Havas, March 16)

(Moscow) Today's Pravda stated that the complete submission of Czechoslovakia has increased Germany's threat to Poland, Hungary, and Romania, and has plunged Central Europe into new conflicts and wars. German fascism has now shown its tendency not to abide by promises, which is the result of the Anglo-French appeasement policy. (Reuters, March 15)

### Deep Impression in Rome

(Rome) After German troops entered Moravia and Bohemia, Italian public opinion felt a deep impression because it had not anticipated the sudden turn of events. Political figures were superficially very happy, saying that the strength of Italy's allies had been enhanced, and Italy would inevitably benefit in the Mediterranean. The democratic system has now suffered a major blow, and the international justice on which all-powerful countries are based has obviously won. (Havas, March 15)

### Guo Taiqi Delivers a Speech For the Sake of British Trade

(London) The Financial News here recently published that Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi delivered a speech at the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce yesterday, clarifying that China's foreign trade must maintain the principle of the open door. His words were slightly: "China is Britain's potentially largest customer, the past facts have already proved it to be true, and the future trend will inevitably prove it to be so. Indeed, the economic foundations of China and Britain are different, so trade can correspond to supply and demand, and the temperament and attitude of each other have been proven to be compatible through a long period of testing. Based on this, if there is a threat to China's 'open door' principle, it is tantamount to threatening the lifeline of British prosperity. Therefore, for the sake of Britain, maintaining the 'open door' principle is to maintain the integrity of the treaty, and also to maintain trade rights." (Havas, March 16)

### Stabilizing Chinese Currency - British House of Commons Begins Debate - Chancellor of the Exchequer Explains the Nature of the Loan

(London) The Chinese currency stabilization plan was submitted to the House of Commons today by Chancellor of the Exchequer Mr. Simon. The total amount of this fund is ten million pounds, which is used to curb the improper fluctuations in the true value of Chinese legal tender. Among them, HSBC Bank will bear three million pounds, Mercally Bank two million pounds, and the remaining five million pounds will be jointly borne by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. This fund will be managed by a committee composed of five people, two of whom will be jointly appointed by the Chinese banking community, HSBC and Mercally Bank will each nominate one person, and the remaining one will be a British expert, who will be hired by the Chinese government with the consent of the British Treasury and the approval of the two British banks. The responsibility of the committee will be to determine the daily policy of how to maintain the true value of Chinese legal tender from improper fluctuations. HSBC and Mercally Bank will receive interest once every six months. This interest is calculated based on British gold, and its fixed rate is 2.75 percent. If the surplus from London deposit investments is not enough to pay this interest, it will be paid by the Chinese banking community, and the British Treasury will guarantee the payment of interest. Furthermore, if the British banking community suffers any losses when this fund ends, the British Treasury will also guarantee compensation, limited to five million pounds in British gold. However, if the amount earned by the British banks in addition to interest when this fund ends exceeds the amount originally borne by them, then all the surplus funds should be paid to the British Treasury. The effective period of the above measures is one year, which can be extended by six months each time. (Reuters, March 15)

(Berlin) Head of State Hitler signed an order in the Czech capital this morning, stating that since Czechoslovakia has become the core of threatening European peace and German security, Germany must place Bohemia and Moravia under its protection. The full text of the order includes twelve points, namely: (1) From now on, Bohemia and Moravia will become German protectorates. (2) Germans in each province will become German citizens, and people of other ethnic groups will become citizens of the protectorate.

(4) The head of the autonomous organ of the protectorate should obtain the trust of Head of State Hitler. (5) The Head of State may appoint a Governor-General to represent Germany in Bohemia and Moravia in order to supervise local officials in carrying out the Head of State's orders. The heads of the autonomous organs of the protectorate should be under the control of the Governor-General, and the measures they take may be revoked or suspended by the Governor-General. (6) The protectorate's foreign affairs shall be handled by Germany, and the citizens of the protectorate residing abroad shall be protected by Germany on their behalf. (Chairman) Germany may station troops and deploy defense works in the protectorate to fulfill its military protection responsibilities. The protectorate may set up security organs to maintain local order. (8) The protectorate's transportation, postal service, and radio stations shall be monitored by Germany.

Czech Capital - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop recently delivered a radio speech here, stating that Moravia and Bohemia are now under German protection. His words were: "Each province is related to Germany's space for survival, and the original violent system it promoted is an obstacle to peace. In order to stop this system, we had to come forward and intervene. The government of Czechoslovakia does not have the ability to organize the common life of the people and maintain peace. Germany cannot sit idly by for a long time in this situation, so it took intervention actions in order to restore order as soon as possible." (Havas, March 16)

(Berlin) Regarding Germany's protection of Bohemia and Moravia, the order issued by Head of State Hitler today intends to legally defend Germany, saying that the provinces are not completely absorbed by Germany. In fact, the reservations contained in this order are numerous, which shows that the sovereignty retained by the provinces is nominal. According to this order, the German government may appoint a Governor-General, also known as the "Protector," to be stationed in the Czech capital. He enjoys the right to veto the decisions made by the administrative organs of the protectorate, and the German Minister of Interior can take all necessary measures to make up for its shortcomings. In addition, certain locations in Bohemia and Moravia will establish a special system due to military strategic reasons. It is not yet known which locations this refers to, but it is generally believed that areas inhabited by Germans, such as the cities of Brno and Olomouc, may be directly incorporated into German territory.

### Beneš Speaks in the United States - Czechoslovakia Re-partitioned - Another International Crime

Chicago - Former Czech President Beneš, who is currently lecturing in the United States, recently gave a speech to the press, stating, "The re-partition of Czechoslovakia is another international crime, which is outrageous. The four countries that signed the Munich Agreement had solemnly promised to guarantee the survival and territorial security of Czechoslovakia. Now, one of them, after deliberately creating disputes, suddenly cited it as an excuse and sent troops to cruelly divide the Czech Republic. This is intolerable. As of today, the struggle for a free Europe and mankind has entered a new stage. The Czech and Slovak people, under the leadership of the late President Masaryk during the European War, have already demonstrated their fighting instincts. Now, they must continue to work hard to achieve completion. This is what the people of the two ethnic groups who live in various free countries must realize. Although we are now succumbing to violence, we firmly believe that the struggle for individual freedom will eventually triumph over violence. This is inevitable due to reason and power."

Prior to this, Foreign Minister Bonnet had reported to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies on the developments in Czechoslovakia, stating that Britain and France had the original obligation to guarantee the border of Czechoslovakia in accordance with the Munich Agreement, but on the condition that Germany did the same. However, Germany has not provided guarantees.

Warsaw: According to reliable sources reported today, Germany and Poland are about to negotiate to resolve all the aftermath issues after the occupation of the Czech Republic.

### Germany Annexes Czech Republic, Expands Territory, Rich in Mineral Reserves

(Berlin) After Bohemia and Moravia were incorporated into Greater Germany, Germany's territory area increased by 40,000 square kilometers, and the population also increased by 6,800,000 people. Its strategic border line has been shortened by 500 kilometers. Various newspapers have claimed that the provinces are rich in mineral resources. The iron mine in the Beroun area produces 500,000 tons annually, and the coal mines in Karviná and Moravská Ostrava produce 10,000,000 to 11,000,000 tons annually. The production of silver-lead mines and forests in various places is also considerable. However, these provinces are industrial areas, and most of their manufactured products are supplied for export. Now that they have been absorbed by Germany, Germany will increasingly feel a shortage of raw materials and food products, and the average density of the population will also increase. The so-called German "living space" organization problem remains unresolved. Therefore, Germany is bound to strive to increase the quantity of export goods in exchange for various raw materials. It can be asserted that this will happen. (March 16th, Havas Telegraph)

Therefore, future purchases of automobiles will be limited to those equipped with "Diesel" engines, because the current market price of gasoline in Chongqing is 5 yuan per gallon, which is four times higher than the price in Shanghai, which is economically very uneconomical.

Guilin: Guizhou Civil Affairs Director Lei Yin went to Nanning, Longzhou, and other areas for inspection last month and returned to the province on the 14th. It is said that since the War of Resistance, rural villagers have directly received education and their culture has increased several times. The mood for resisting Japan has therefore increased, making it easier for the government to handle conscription and corvée. The people are also competing to participate in road construction and highway destruction. In addition, the rural economy is also very active, and many wastelands in the Zuojiang and Youjiang river basins have been opened up, with abundant production. All of this is a gain from the War of Resistance, which proves that resistance is nation-building. (March 16th, Electric Dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Along the Pinghan Railway Suffer Heavy Losses

(Luoyang) In the past week, there has been warfare in Xushui, Gaoyang, Hejian, Raoyang, and Xianxian in the east of the Pinghan Railway, and in Yixian and Mancheng in the west of the Pinghan Railway. The Japanese attempt is to wipe out Chinese guerrillas in these areas, but the highly mobile Chinese army has not only not been wiped out, but has inflicted heavy blows on the attackers. In total, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers have been killed in the past week, and many spoils of war have been seized. This proves that guerrilla warfare in various places can get the assistance of the people. The people's transportation of grain and ammunition in the face of gunfire has become a widespread phenomenon. Even elderly women in their sixties and seventies can overcome difficulties and dangers, carrying food and soup to offer comfort and encouragement to the soldiers. (March 16th, Electric Dispatch)

### Simultaneous Emphasis on Land, Sea, and Air: The Soviet Military Strength Greatly Increased; Border Defenses Also Actively Improved; Minister of National Defense Presents Report to the All-Soviet Congress

(Moscow) Soviet People's Commissar for Defense Voroshilov recently declared at the 18th Communist Party Congress that during the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Army has more than doubled, the Air Force has increased by 130%, and warships are currently under construction to form a powerful fleet. When referring to the Air Force, Voroshilov stated that the Soviet Union currently has bombers with speeds exceeding 300 miles per hour and an ascent altitude of up to 9 miles. As for the Soviet Union's border defenses, they have undergone active improvements, and the number of special troops stationed in these fortified areas has also greatly increased. (Reuters, 15th)

(Moscow) The 18th National Congress of the Soviet Russian Communist Party continued today. First, the famous Arctic explorer and Director of the Northern Sea Route Administration, Babanin, presented a report stating that after the completion of the Arctic sea route, the distance between the eastern and western ends of the Soviet territory will be shortened by half. This type of navigation primarily uses icebreakers as tools, and the quality of the Soviet Russian icebreaker fleet is not only unmatched by other countries, but it can also "be used to escort the Baltic Fleet through the Arctic Ocean to the Far Eastern waters." Subsequently, Civil Affairs Councillor Fornasonesko delivered a speech stating that the production of various raw materials related to national defense has already been increased. The amount of investment in various economic sectors in the eastern regions originally accounted for 12% of the total national economic investment during the Second Five-Year Plan, and it has now increased to 18% during the Third Five-Year Plan. "A certain neighboring country in the Far East, overestimating its capabilities, has repeatedly made provocative decisions. Our country, in order to enrich national strength and prepare for contingencies, has increased the total industrial output by more than three times. The Far Eastern region has also been transformed into an indestructible Soviet outpost." Then, the People's Commissar for the Iron and Steel Industry, Megurov, delivered a speech confirming the surge in Soviet industrial output, stating that iron production has increased by two and a half times, and steel production has increased by three and a half times. (Havas, 16th)

### Japan-Soviet Fishery Negotiations

(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita, in response to inquiries regarding the progress of fishery negotiations during the debate on the budget案 in the House of Peers today, stated that the discussions between the Japanese Ambassador to Moscow, Togo, and the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, on the 11th and 14th of this month, had no new developments. The Soviet Union insisted on its original intention and did not pay attention to Japan's requests. Togo suggested to Litvinov that the auction scheduled for the 15th of this month should be postponed, but Litvinov refused to accept this proposal, stating that if the fishing areas were not all sold smoothly, they would be auctioned again. Thereupon, Togo declared to Litvinov that Japan would not participate in or recognize the results of the unilateral implementation of the auction by the Soviet Union without the consent of the countries concerned (Japan), and that the Soviet Union must bear the responsibility for the consequences. Currently, Tokyo has not yet received official information regarding the auction held in Vladivostok on the 15th of this month, but the Japanese government will continue diplomatic consultations with the Soviet Union in order to peacefully resolve this issue. Japan will not recognize the results of the auction, and this point has already been conveyed to Litvinov by Togo. When asked about the Japanese government's attitude in the event of the worst possible scenario, Arita replied that the government has already decided to take the most effective and appropriate steps in the event of the worst possible scenario to protect Japan's treaty fishing rights. (Reuters, 16th)

### First Phase Has Collected 500,000: Guangxi Province Begins Second Phase of Conscription; Many People Volunteer Before Being Called Up

Guangxi Correspondence: This time, after the outbreak of the war of resistance, Guangxi can be considered the province with the most thorough and rapid conscription. This is because Guangxi's grassroots political organization, after five or six years of work, clearly surveyed and statistically accounted for the province's population. Counties and cities, as autonomous units, are divided into several districts, which are further divided into several townships, which are further divided into several villages and streets, which are further divided into several jia. The jia leaders directly manage the household registrations. The provincial government sends an order to the county, and the county government delivers it to each district and then to each township. The heads of each township immediately execute the order, directly reaching the village and street leaders and then each household unit. The organization is

interconnected, just like the arm being used by the body, and the finger being used by the arm. Therefore, the implementation of all government orders is especially easy and swift. There are a total of more than 24,900 villages and streets in Guangxi Province, with a population of more than 13 million. The area is vast, and the resources are abundant. The grain production is ample. If it were located in Europe, it could stand tall as a powerful nation. In recent years, after the heads of Li, Bai, and Huang have buried their heads in hard work, striving for governance, military training, political reform, and economic construction, things have gradually begun to take shape. Although it has not yet formed the prosperity of a modern society, it has somewhat achieved the goal of "self-sufficiency." There are statistically more than 2.6 million able-bodied men in Guangxi between the ages of 18 and 35. These more than 2.6 million able-bodied men have generally undergone three to six months of military training and possess considerable military knowledge. In the early stages of the war of resistance, each village and street selected 20 able-bodied men, using a lottery method to determine the order of selection.

Statistically, a total of more than 500,000 were selected. Of these more than 500,000 able-bodied men, more than 300,000 were used in various battlefields during the early stages of the war of resistance. Approximately 200,000 were concentrated in the rear for training and formed into regular troops, but have not yet been sent to various battlefields. There are also tens of thousands who have already been drawn in the lottery and are prepared to be called up, but remain in the villages. The Guangxi authorities are now, for the sake of defending Guangxi, conscripting all the able-bodied men who had been drawn in the lottery in the early stages but had not yet been called up, forming them into special teams, and assigning them to the direct command of the county governments. Each county establishes at least two to six special teams. The number of teams and the size of the troops are determined according to the needs of the local environment in each county. The deputy county magistrate of each county also serves concurrently as the captain of the special team, specializing in protecting local security and assisting the regular army in combat, in order to enhance local self-defense capabilities. After the successive fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the early stages of the war of resistance temporarily came to an end, and the later stages of the war of resistance began anew. However, the center of gravity of the later stages of the war of resistance has shifted from the northeast to the southwest. Standing on the front lines of the southwest, bearing the important task, is Guangxi. Therefore, Guangxi's second phase of conscription is

now underway. It has been found that Guangxi's conscription in the early stages was carried out strictly in accordance with the conscription law jointly formulated by the provincial government and the Fifth Route Army Headquarters. Except for elementary school teachers, students, specialized technical personnel, township and village heads, and those who are permitted to be exempted from service as stipulated in the regulations, regardless of their occupation, if they are able-bodied men of appropriate age, they must all be conscripted in accordance with the law. The restrictions of the conscription law are strict, and the execution of conscription is extremely severe. Even those who rely on one person in an entire industrial and commercial enterprise for production, those who rely on one person in an eight-person family for support, and only sons who are poor and helpless, are all conscripted and are not allowed to hire substitutes. Those who are conscripted, if they evade or claim to be engaged in business outside, and do not respond to the conscription, their parents, siblings, wives, and children will be detained. Some leniency is shown to mothers. Starting last year, Guangxi's pre-determined conscription law has also been slightly modified, and there are now regulations for the payment of a deferred service fee. All

able-bodied men, such as civil servants, teachers, students, and those with special occupational difficulties who cannot be conscripted for service immediately, may, before the lottery, be certified by the township and village heads as being factual, and are allowed to pay a deferred service fee of one hundred yuan to defer service for one year. The families of those who had been detained for evading conscription in the past are all released, and this harsh regulation is abolished. Now that the all-out war of resistance has entered its later stages, Guangxi Province is again conducting the second phase of conscription. Further revisions have been made to the previous conscription law, and an item for conscription substitution has been added. All conscripted soldiers, if unable to serve immediately due to circumstances, are allowed to hire a qualified able-bodied man as a substitute. However, when this able-bodied man has already been drawn in the lottery and it is his turn to be conscripted, he will be replaced by the conscripted soldier as a conscripted soldier. The township and village heads decide whether to allow the hiring of conscripts. However, this category of qualified able-bodied men who replace the conscripted soldier is limited to those who have a registered residence in the county. Since the third revision of the conscription procedures, the people of the entire province have praised its convenience. Those who volunteer before being called up even outnumber those who replace conscripted soldiers. This is because the people are motivated by the enthusiasm to protect their homeland and protect their families. Other than taking up arms, there is truly no other good way to survive. In short, there is no need to worry about a lack of military resources in Guangxi, and there is also no way to evade conscription. As long as the authorities understand the people's concerns, are good at using laws and regulations, and implement conscription, then zealous and healthy men who are willing to sacrifice everything to serve their country will naturally come in a continuous stream.

Inspection Notes from the Western Frontier

### Xikang's Treasure Trove: Investigation of the Rongjing Copper Mine

Copper Content is Very Rich: Daily Production Can Reach Approximately 20 Tons

Kangding Correspondence: Since the rise of military affairs, coastal ports have mostly been blockaded by the Japanese, and all wartime and peacetime resources have been greatly affected. Developing resources and replenishing the front lines is a matter of urgent importance. Xikang is rich in products and especially abundant in mineral resources. Since the establishment of the province, the authorities have paid attention to surveying and exploring various natural resources. Primitive and mysterious virgin lands that have never been explored will also be actively utilized and developed separately.

Rongjing is Rich in Minerals. During this trip to Kangding, the reporter inspected various departments and paid special attention to mineral resources. When passing through Rongjing last month, I thoroughly investigated the reserves and quality of the county's hematite ore and reported them truthfully. However, Rongjing's mineral resources are not limited to hematite. There are also large reserves of bituminous coal in the Huajianzi, Banjiujing, and Huayan areas, and anthracite coal in the Ronghe River basin. Copper ore is also abundant in various districts throughout the county. In addition, there are millions of hardwood trees with diameters of more than one foot in the Daxianling area, which can be used for railroad ties. The great Rongjing is almost a treasure trove. The people of the country should pay special attention to how to utilize and develop these abundant resources to strengthen our power.

Copper Mine Suspended. Rongjing is located southwest of Ya'an, with high peaks and deep valleys, steep and treacherous terrain, and controls the passage between Sichuan and Kang. The richness of its mineral deposits surpasses that of eastern Kang. In addition to coal and iron, copper ore is also abundant. According to the reporter's investigation over the past few days, the county's copper ore is found in various districts, with the ore in Daihuanggou and Shanxilin in the northern district being the most promising, followed by the ore in Qianhou Juba in the eastern district. The discovery of the Shanxilin copper mine did not occur in ancient times. The depth of the old mines that have been operated is only thirty to forty feet. The reason for its suspension was definitely flooding, and it was not abandoned because the ore was exhausted. Therefore, reopening it today must still proceed along the old Shanxilin mines to be sure of success. In the past, there were two mines in this area, one was the Baoxing Mine owned by the Ma family, founded in the 20th year of the Guangxu reign, and the other was the Sanyuan Mine owned by the Li family. By the early years of the Republic of China, when it had been dug to a depth of forty feet, the water flowed in horizontally because the mining expanded in all directions and penetrated the walls of the Baoxing Mine, resulting in the same fate of closure. It is a pity that it has been suspended until now.

Ore Bed Composition. The Baoxing and Sanyuan mines are located in Shanxilin, Daihuangkou, about ten miles from the mountain peak and about six miles from the foot of the mountain, on the Luzhou-Rongjing main road. The road is narrow and the walls are steep, making it difficult to climb. At the foot of the mountain, there are two sign-style smelting furnaces from the Sanyuan Mine and many iron ore ponds, which have not been completely destroyed. The mine is 120 li from Rongjing County and 550 li from Chengdu. Copper must be transported out through 210 li of dry land before reaching Ya'an, and then transported by car to Chengdu or by boat to Jiading. The ore beds mined by the Baoxing and Sanyuan mines are all vertical columnar, which the locals call vertical-core ore. The column is small at the top and large at the bottom, forming a conch shape. It is said that local methods of pumping water have reached 48 bamboo tubes, but the tubes are not all upright. The approximate depth of the mining has reached about 40 feet. According to the chemical tests at that time, the copper content of the ore is about 10%, which is two and a half times better than the average copper content of 4% in the Dabao Mountain copper mine in Baishuihe, Peng County. The copper production area around the Sanyuan Mine is vast. The opposite bank of the Chahaogang mine east of the mine and the Qianxi mountain belly west of the mine both have obvious outcrops. The Doudoudi, 20 li north of the mine, was once mined by the Kaiyuan Iron Factory. Its ore vein is eight li long, 20 li wide, and 1.5 chi thick. From this, the economic value of the copper mine in the northern district of Rongjing can be seen.

Smelting Method. In the past, copper was smelted entirely using local methods. The refining pond was shaped like an armchair, 6 chi high at the edge, 9 chi in diameter, and 8 chi in width. In the first step, smelting the ore with charcoal fire takes about 10 days. In the second step, smelting the ore requires three roasts and three beatings, roughly three days. After the copper liquid solidifies, it is dragged away with wooden strips. The first few layers that are uncovered are water copper, the next few layers are 鍜銅, and the bottom is正銅. In the third step, copper matte is smelted. The refining pond is smaller than the ore pond, and it is layered, paved, and 翻 hammered five times. Copper beads must be found on top of the copper matte. In the fourth step, copper is cast. The furnace is used for smelting, and the doors are closed to抽風until it turns red. Finally, it is refined in a reverberatory furnace to obtain 99% pure copper. It is found that if the Rongjing copper mine is mined and smelted on a large scale, it can produce 15 to 20 tons of refined copper per day. However, the ore layer has not yet been definitively confirmed. If new smelting methods are used, we must wait for the government to appoint geological experts and mining experts to conduct multiple surveys before it can be discussed. Currently, during the war of resistance, the need for refined copper is extremely high and urgent, and development cannot be delayed. Generally, it is believed that the Shanxilin copper mine in Daihuanggou, Rongjing, is best tried out by the Kang Provincial Government. The budgeted cost of preparing the funds is 100,000 national currency. As for the copper mine in Qianhou Juba, Rongjing, it is best for the provincial government to encourage private operation. If the capital is insufficient, the province will pre-pay a portion. In this way, the people will eagerly prepare and start construction because the copper has a sales market and the provincial government assists with the preparation costs. It can be asserted that the amount of copper obtained will be large.

### President of Jiangsu Provincial News Agency, Yang Hanmei, Injured in Bombing

Taixian Correspondence: Yang Hanmei, a native of Changshu, has worked in the news industry many times. Before the war of resistance, he organized the Southeast News Agency in Zhenjiang, the provincial capital, to report news from the provincial capital. When Zhenjiang fell, Yang followed the provincial government personnel and took refuge in Huaiyin, where he reorganized the Jiangsu Provincial News Agency and served as its president. During the recent Japanese invasion of northern Jiangsu, planes frantically bombed Huaiyin. Yang was unfortunately injured in the bombing, and his left eye was also blinded. He is currently being treated in a rear hospital, and his fate is still uncertain.

After Guiyang Was Bombed, Reconstruction is Planned, Headed by Zhou Yichun

Guiyang Correspondence: Guiyang is located among thousands of mountains, and the northeast sides have the famous Panshan and Huaqiuping. It is also often foggy, making it very difficult for planes to fly over. However, Japanese planes came to Guiyang twice in early September of last year and intruded into the city's airspace, but there was little damage. On February 4 of this year, at 11:00 AM, 18 Japanese planes came to the skies over Guiyang and arbitrarily dropped more than 100 bombs from a high altitude. The area around the city's Da Shizi (Great Cross) and the surrounding bustling downtown area was turned into scorched earth. The party and government organs immediately established disaster relief centers to provide condolences. According to the registry, 735 people were injured, 521 died, and 1,326 buildings were destroyed, encompassing 42 streets. There were 13,439 disaster victims, with property losses of more than 25 million yuan. The provincial government has raised funds and distributed condolence money on the 10th of this month, divided into six categories for the deceased: 10 yuan, 15 yuan, 20 yuan, 25 yuan, 30 yuan, and 35 yuan. The injured all received 5 yuan. Most of the disaster-stricken people have already returned to the city. Regarding the plans for the reconstruction of Guiyang, (A) a disaster relief committee has been organized. The provincial government and the party headquarters have jointly convened local banks to establish a committee to handle the issue of loans for the disaster-stricken merchants. Several meetings have been held, and the plan has been finalized. It is said that Zhou Yichun is in charge. (B) Ten reservoirs are planned to be built. The fire spread very widely during the bombing, partly due to poor construction materials and partly due to insufficient fire-fighting water supply. Eight reservoirs with a capacity of 200,000 liters each and two reservoirs with a capacity of 600,000 liters each are planned to be built, with a total estimated cost of more than 52,000 yuan. The frugality of the expenditure is unprecedented. (C) After the bombing, the authorities have planned a robust air defense plan. If Japanese planes come again, they will be severely attacked. Many solid air raid shelters will also be built to provide refuge for the people.

### Successful Sino-Burmese Trial Flight: British Jumbo Jet Arrives in Kunming

In order to facilitate transportation between China and Europe, the two countries of China and England have opened up the Sino-British air route. China National Aviation Corporation sent a small plane to try the route yesterday, and the results were satisfactory. On the 1st of this month, British Airways specially dispatched aircraft C.A.B.T.J., piloted by Captain Holley and co-piloted by Born, along with radio operator Stillman, mechanic Stadelman, and Air Force attaché Bithos. They took off from Yangon in the morning and arrived in Lashio in the afternoon. On the morning of the 2nd, they took off from Lashio at 8:40 AM and arrived in Kunming at 11:40 AM. Those who welcomed them at the airport included British Consul Davison, Aviation School Principal Zhou, Director Niu, representative of the Ministry of Communications and China National Aviation Corporation, and Secretary Li of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, totaling more than 50 people. Aircraft C.A.B.T.J. appeared in the sky above the airport at 11:25 AM, surveyed the area once, and slowly landed. The center of the aircraft was decorated with the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag, the left and right sides hung the British Airways flag, and the tail hung the British flag. When the aircraft touched the ground, the welcomers threw flowers at the aircraft and passengers with great enthusiasm. For a time, the open wilderness of the airport was filled with vibrant colors, and the scene was very lively. The aircraft flew back to Yangon on the morning of the 3rd to report on the flight situation. The official opening date will be decided after both parties have discussed it.

### Marital Happiness is the Privilege of Healthy Men

……Married men have more happiness, but kidney deficiency brings helplessness;

……If treatment comes early, restoring health is also easy.

We have repeatedly advised men that if they are physically weak, especially if they have committed masturbation or spermatorrhea, which has weakened their natural functions and caused incomplete development, it is best to postpone marriage. This is because unmarried men have fewer responsibilities and are easier to treat. If they marry rashly without knowing the dangers, they are bound to develop dangerous kidney deficiency after marriage. In addition, men who are overly licentious or indulge in multiple wives after marriage, resulting in depletion of essence and blood, are also very prone to this disease.

Once a married man develops kidney deficiency, various conditions such as seminal emission, sperm leakage, premature ejaculation, impotence, lack of energy, infertility after prolonged marriage, mental weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, and back pain will follow. Therefore, not only are they burdened with heavy family responsibilities after marriage, but their poor health often leads to failure in their careers, causing them to suffer from poverty and hardship. In addition, they cannot satisfy their wives in their marital life, leading to frequent quarrels and even tragedies in the family! Therefore, it is truly sensible to say that "happiness in married life is the exclusive right of healthy men." Let us imagine a healthy couple, during the warm and sunny spring when peach blossoms are red and willows are green, their love is bound to grow stronger, they give birth to clever and lively children, and they organize a happy and fulfilling family. They live a sweet and warm life in an atmosphere of love. What happiness that is! However, a husband with kidney deficiency, even if he has a beautiful wife, where is their love? Who can understand the tragedy of family life and the hidden pain in his heart? Because of the invasion of suffering, many such men age prematurely or even die young!

Smart men should know that since the invention of endocrine therapy for reproductive glands in the medical field, the above-mentioned diseases have the most targeted and effective treatment methods. Endocrine therapy for reproductive glands was invented by Austrian physiologist Dr. Steinach. Initially, the reproductive gland hormones of strong animals were directly supplied to the human body, but the surgical procedure was difficult and not easily accessible to the general public. Therefore, the reproductive gland hormones were extracted from the bodies of Germans (Comklings) Conklin and others, and reproduced to become a preparation called Steinach's "Gonadotrophin." It is easy to use and has great efficacy. After taking it, it can generate sperm, replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood, and nourish nerves within a day and night. If taken continuously, it can completely cure the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time, and it can also prolong life, rejuvenate, and reverse aging. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Hemi 脱氏 Sperm-Solidifying Pills" to solidify the sperm gate and prevent leakage, so that the effect is even faster! If patients can come to our clinic in person to be diagnosed by expert doctors and then receive electrotherapy, injections, surgery, and other methods, a cure can be guaranteed.

### Simplified Treatment for Nocturnal Emission

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianzeng

Young people, due to a lack of sexual knowledge and very strong sexual desires, are easily led astray by negative influences, and easily develop the bad habit of masturbation. After prolonged masturbation or reckless indulgence, the sexual nerves are damaged, and the gatekeeping function of semen is lost, leading to nocturnal emission. There are three types of nocturnal emission: wet dreams, non-dream emission, and leakage. Wet dreams are a milder condition and easier to treat. If left untreated, it can develop into non-dream emission (spermatorrhea). In the case of seeing a woman or receiving other stimulation, there may be seminal emission even during the day, or there may be leakage of semen during defecation or urination. This is the most dangerous type of leakage.

Semen within the body nourishes the various organs and can regulate metabolism. If semen is lost excessively, metabolism will be the first to suffer. The production of new cells in various organs and tissues will decrease, while the death of old cells will increase. Therefore, various parts of the body will gradually become thin, leading to a sallow and emaciated state. Development will stagnate, leading to incomplete development and premature aging. At the same time, the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves will weaken, often resulting in headaches, inability to think deeply, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, backaches, and fatigue... Consequently, the body becomes emaciated, on the verge of collapse, wasting youth and ruining life.

Nocturnal emission is not incurable as long as it is treated correctly. First, the act of masturbation must be stopped. Cultivate a peaceful mind and few desires, engage in outdoor exercise, read fewer unhealthy books, wash the local area with cold water before sleeping, drink less tea, pay attention to urination, wear loose clothing, and avoid excessively warm bedding. At the same time, take the specific medication for nocturnal emission, "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Pills," to strengthen the semen gate and calm the nerves. Then, after a short-lived dream, waking up in the morning will not only eliminate nocturnal emission but also enhance mental strength. If nocturnal emission has already caused the various weakening symptoms mentioned above, then it is necessary to also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Germinal Hormone" to nourish the brain, replenish essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continued use will ensure an early return to health.

Health and Beauty

### Love of Beauty Begins with Love of the Breasts

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

If you ignore the breasts and focus solely on decoration, it's like 'putting powder on pockmarks,' which only highlights the ugliness!

Every beauty-loving woman, when you stand in front of the mirror every day to do your makeup, please quietly think to yourself: 'Do I have any flaws? What is the cause of these flaws? Will they affect my overall appearance? Can they be covered with powder? If not, what methods or medications should I use?' Regarding these questions, I think every intelligent girl needs to consider them carefully. Because while love of beauty is human nature, we must not be foolishly 'putting powder on pockmarks and squandering our inheritance.' Consider: 'Putting powder on pockmarks' already squanders one's inheritance, indicating futility. Then, if the breasts, which are related to a woman's health, beauty, and happiness, become withered, isn't it even more foolish and contemptible to rely on superficial decorations instead of addressing the root cause? Moreover, times are advancing. What modern women champion is no longer the morbid beauty of 'affected airs and graces' but emphasizes the development of distinctive features. With developed distinctive features, the breasts are high and the buttocks are full. This not only creates a beautiful overall curve but also ensures healthy ovarian function, vigorous metabolism, a gentle disposition, crystal-clear skin, and cheeks flushed with the radiance of peach blossoms. Look at this woman! Even without makeup, isn't she as lovely as a celestial being? Therefore, as a maiden, she is pursued by everyone. And after marriage, the love between the sexes is very strong. Not only that, but because of their healthy body and mind, the children they bear are particularly lively and intelligent. They are virtuous wives and good mothers, enjoying happiness and joy. How glorious and delightful is this? If, due to early binding of the chest, masturbation, or post-illness weakness, menstrual irregularities, leukorrhea, anemia, and other symptoms that impair ovarian function and affect breast development, not only will they suffer from illness and pain and lose their beauty, but they will also be disliked and even abandoned by their husbands! The only remedy is to quickly take the ovarian preparation "Female Germinal Hormone." This preparation can nourish ovarian function and promote metabolism within one day and night after taking it. Continued use will surely cause the breasts to rise, the buttocks to become full, the cheeks to become rosy, and youth to be prolonged in a short period of time.

### Spring is the Opportunity to Radically Cure Gonorrhea

Now that the spring breeze is gentle and flowers and birds welcome people, the season of severe cold has passed, and our actions have changed from dreary to lively! At this time, due to social activities, such as excessive drinking and fatigue, it is worse than other times. Therefore, those who have not recovered from leukorrhea often relapse because of this, and those who have not suffered from leukorrhea are often easily infected because of this. It is clear that spring has a special connection with leukorrhea. This is something to be aware of.

Although spring has a special connection with gonorrhea, it is also easier to treat than other seasons. Isn't this nature giving us an opportunity for easy treatment? Many cases of chronic gonorrhea that are difficult to cure often have viruses lurking inside. Usually, if not overly fatigued, there are no obvious symptoms. However, one day, due to stimulation from alcohol, food, fatigue, or sexual activity, these latent roots are stirred, and old leukorrhea reappears externally. Such as turbid urine, the gonorrheal system is like tattered wadding. Symptoms that were once thought to be completely cured reappear on the body. As for those who, due to indulging in wine and food, often engage in illicit acts, such as visiting prostitutes, most end up being infected with leukorrhea. All of this proves that acute leukorrhea is most easily transmitted in the spring. However, patients must not be pessimistic. This is precisely an opportunity for easy treatment. As for chronic gonorrhea, there is no need to use general stimulation methods to find out. The treatment of acute gonorrhea is even easier. Taking advantage of the active cells in spring and the greater resistance than in other seasons, it is easiest to be effective. For chronic leukorrhea such as arthritis, orchitis, and urethral stricture, I use Xi's serum, suspensory bandages, Puqi, and German filtrate electrophoresis to completely cure it. What would take five weeks to cure at other times can be radically cured in four weeks at this time. For acute leukorrhea, such as using specially made gonococci for injection, as well as cold electrotherapy, hot bath therapy, and filtrate electrotherapy, and also using agile surgery to correct the condition, the pain of acute leukorrhea, which causes all kinds of suffering, can be relieved in a few hours, and the high fever caused by the gonorrheal reaction can be eliminated. It can be absolutely radically cured in one or two weeks. However, if this method is not followed at this time, it will be impossible to achieve the goal of radical cure.

Specialties: Also treats syphilis, inguinal bubo, chancroid, and painless new method of circumcision.

### Various Public Organizations Telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Protest Unfriendly Behavior of Concessions: French Concession Interferes with Citizens Hanging National Flags; International Settlement Allows Japanese to Publicly Arrest People

Various public organizations in the city, due to the French Concession authorities interfering with citizens hanging national flags, conducting arbitrary inspections, and the International Settlement tolerating Japanese military police publicly arresting people, with no guarantee of citizens' safety, sent a joint telegram on the 16th to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Chongqing, protesting to the British, American, and French ambassadors against the two concession authorities' disregard for diplomatic relations and violation of legal principles, and ordered the ambassadors stationed in those countries to negotiate with their respective governments.

### Japan Blocks Raw Materials in Occupied Areas: Factory Raw Materials Prohibited from Export; Coal Transport Also Prohibited

The Chief of Staff of the Japanese Central China Military Command recently notified the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" to stipulate that during the Yangtze River blockade period, private individuals are prohibited from transporting minerals and certain plants from Japanese-occupied areas to areas outside the Japanese-occupied areas (such as the public concession and the French Concession in Shanghai, and the unoccupied areas of the Central China provinces, and the guerrilla areas controlled by mobile units). And the puppet organization posted a large number of fake "bulletins" yesterday in Pudong and other places, in accordance with the intentions of the Japanese military, blocking the export of the above items, including four categories: (1) Products and materials made of copper, iron, steel, native copper, lead, zinc, antimony, manganese, fluorite, mica, aluminum, etc., and their ores. However, products, materials, and ores of iron and steel (including iron filings) may be transported to the interior by Japanese joint-stock companies. (2) Machinery. (3) Coal. (4) Hemp (including bark), cotton (including tussah silk), leather, and hides (personal leather clothing is not prohibited, but no more than two leather bundles per person). Although the Japanese and puppet authorities did not publicly state their reasons for this move, it is nothing more than that the above items are necessary for military purposes. However, some factories in the two concessions in Shanghai, outside the Japanese-occupied area, cannot do without the above items. Taking coal as an example, it is indispensable for even a single day.

### Japan Formulates Traffic Regulations in North of Suzhou Creek, Imposes Strict Restrictions on Drivers; Municipal Council Refuses to Comment

The Continental Daily reported that the Municipal Council recently established an agreement with the Japanese authorities on police affairs in the Public Concession. Whether the police department maintains its integrity is unclear. However, in the area north of Suzhou Creek, the Japanese Special Naval Landing Force has managed traffic laws on its own. From now on, drivers must obey their rules, and we will suffer the consequences ourselves. Regarding the procedures for correcting violations, the Japanese Landing Force has not announced any regulations. Yesterday, a legitimate person in charge expressed the opinion that foreigners enjoying consular jurisdiction will not pay attention to any actions taken by the Japanese side, because they cannot recognize the Japanese Landing Force as a legitimate management organization of the Public Concession. However, foreigners may face great difficulties from the Japanese before reaching the consular court. If their purpose is only to punish violations, then other procedures are not necessary. The new Japanese regulations were officially implemented yesterday (the 15th). When reporters showed these regulations to Municipal Council personnel, they shrugged their shoulders and refused to express any opinion. Most of the new Japanese regulations will affect foreigners driving cars, and allowing drivers not to smoke while driving is the most. Parking locations in Hongkou and Yangshupu have also been strictly limited. According to the full text of the regulations published in the Japanese newspaper in Shanghai yesterday, the maximum speed of cars in densely populated areas should not exceed 30 kilometers per hour, and in suburban areas should not exceed 40 kilometers. In addition to the no-parking areas stipulated by the Police Department regulations, the following locations are also prohibited from parking: (1) The eastern end of Wusong Road between North Suzhou Road and Haining Road; (2) The southern end of Bazili Road between North Sichuan Road and Wusong Road; (3) Both sides of Broadway Road; (4) The southern end of Peng Road and other stipulated no-parking areas. The following locations are also prohibited from parking: Within 10 meters of street corners, on the left side of safety zones, at intersections of designated pedestrian areas, loading areas, rickshaw parking areas, within 15 meters of guard posts, in front of or within 3 meters of fire stations and fire equipment rooms, and within 3 meters of fire hydrant connections and bridges. These regulations, together with the regulations of the Public Concession Police Department, will be enforced by Police Department personnel, Japanese naval soldiers, Japanese Consulate police, and "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" police in various locations.

### Shipbuilding Industry Will Face Extinction: Four Shipbuilding Yards Along the Huangpu River Continue to Be Occupied by Japan

Since the Japanese army occupied Shanghai, all Chinese-owned shipyards in Shanghai have been seized. The first to bear the brunt was the Jiangfu Shipyard. Recently, the Japanese have occupied the Hengchang, Xiangmao, Chichang, and Caili shipyards, and all machinery and property have been moved away without anything left. Therefore, the shipbuilding industry operated by Chinese people has no hope of survival.

### At the Request of the Japanese, the Police Department Arrested Three Chinese: To Be Sent to the General Police Station; No News Released

The English-language North China Daily News reported that the Public Concession Police Department, at the request of the Japanese military police, arrested three Chinese outside the Zhaofeng Garden in the afternoon of yesterday (the 15th) together with the Japanese military police and sent them to the General Police Station. Regarding this matter, the Police Department has not released any news.

The Shewen News reported that around 9 o'clock the night before, three Chinese were arrested by a certain national near the Zhaofeng Garden on Route de Say-Zoong in the Shanghai French Concession. It is said that one of these three Chinese, named Shen Hengyi, is a famous amateur opera singer in Shanghai. It is understood that the reason for their arrest is that someone accused them of being anti-Japanese elements.

### Rice Industry Yesterday Convened Businesses and Merchants to Advise Compliance with Evaluated Prices and to Unblock Sources, Sent Personnel to Investigate the Total Amount of Rice Stored in the Two Concessions, Arrivals Gradually Increased, Prices Returned and Fell, and the People's Food is Not Worried

After the establishment of the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, jointly formed by seven groups including the Soybean and Rice Industry, they convened a meeting of businesses and merchants yesterday morning at 11:00 AM to advise compliance with the evaluated prices, unblock sources, and investigate the total amount of rice stored in the two concessions. The arrival of goods in Shanghai has gradually increased, and market prices have begun to fall back. Details are as follows:

Comply with Evaluation Prices and Unblock Sources

The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee convened a meeting of various businesses and merchants at the Soybean and Rice Market yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Chairman Fu Qian'geng reported on the establishment process and purpose of the committee, and advised the various businesses to comply with the evaluated prices, namely 14 yuan per stone for high-grade white japonica rice, with corresponding adjustments for medium-grade and other types, in order to maintain the food supply for the people of Shanghai. He hoped that the various businesses and merchants would find ways to unblock sources and avoid hoarding, speculation, and profiteering, so as not to affect the overall food supply for the people. The various businesses and merchants expressed unanimous support for the Evaluation Committee. The meeting adjourned at about 12:00 noon.

Black Market Disappears, Prices Return and Fall

Since the Soybean and Rice Market Management Committee has earnestly implemented price limits, cracked down on black market transactions, and combated hoarding and manipulation, black market transactions in the market have disappeared. General speculators dare not openly purchase, and hoarders have successively sold their stocks. Therefore, market prices have fallen sharply. The arrival of goods has also increased in recent days compared to before. Yesterday, a large batch of early rice japonica rice from Fengjing and other places arrived. Because this japonica rice is not suitable for storage, merchants were eager to sell it, opening the price at 12 yuan and 3 jiao per stone. The prices of other types of rice were all below the price limit.

Begin to Investigate Shanghai's Grain Reserves

The committee has drafted a form and will immediately send personnel to investigate the rice stored in various godowns in the Shanghai Public Concession and French Concession. However, according to estimates by the rice industry, before the market closed for the final accounting, there were 750,000 bags of rice stored in Shanghai, calculated at 1.25 stones per bag, totaling 937,500 stones. As of the 15th of this month, there were 600,000 bags of rice stored in Shanghai, totaling about 750,000 stones. With Shanghai's daily needs at 8,000 stones and monthly needs at 240,000 stones, Shanghai's grain reserves are sufficient for three months.

Organizational Process Reported for Record

The Soybean and Rice Industry Guild has reported the process of jointly forming the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee with various rice industry groups, as well as the committee's articles of association, the list of committee members, and the evaluated prices, to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Public Concession Municipal Council, and the French Concession Board of Directors for record.

### Former Tax Commissioner of Beiping Leaves Shanghai for France

The North China Daily News reported that Gu Nuofan Leifu, who has held various important positions in the Chinese Customs Service and came to Shanghai from Beiping last year due to environmental pressures, took a ship with his family on Monday (the 13th) to southern France. According to reports, Gu has lived in China for 24 years. From 1897, he joined the Chinese Customs Service, serving as the private secretary of the late Sir Robert Hart, acting tax commissioner of Niuzhuang, tax commissioner of Beiping and Harbin, and a member of the Committee for the Liquidation of the China Eastern Railway in 1921. He retired in 1918 and resided in Beiping. He was forced to come south with his family at the end of last year.

### French Concession Denies Tax Increase: The Same as Collected Last Year; External Rumors Are Not Credible

The North China Daily News reported that French Concession Board of Directors personnel yesterday (the 15th) firmly denied rumors that certain taxes would soon increase. It was stated that the budget for 1939 had been passed in December last year, and the taxes collected in this fiscal year are indeed the same as those collected in 1938. Yesterday, there were widespread rumors that the French Concession land tax would increase by 1%, and the entertainment tax would also increase significantly. Yesterday, a senior French Concession official told reporters that the rumor was purely unfounded. Since the implementation of the tax changes, the issue of tax increases has never been raised.

### Shipping Guild Membership Qualifications: Limited to Those with Chinese Nationality; Businesses Joining Must Have No Foreign Capital

The Executive Yuan stated that the Ministry of Communications forwarded the Zhangcheng Committee member roster from the Wenzhou Shipping Guild of Zhejiang Province, requesting approval for establishment and verification of recovery. In accordance with Article 5 of the Commercial Industry Guild Law, the establishment of a Commercial Industry Guild is limited to one guild in the same region. Currently, the Yongjia County Steamboat Industry Guild has been established in Yongjia County. The Wenzhou Shipping Guild is also formed by the steamship industry and is also located in Yongjia County. According to law, it should be ordered to merge. However, Article 14 of the Commercial Industry Guild Law stipulates that member representatives are limited to those with Republic of China nationality. There is no explicit provision in the law as to whether members should be subject to the same restriction. There is also no precedent for foreign steamship companies to join local steamship industry guilds. Although the member representatives of the Wenzhou Shipping Guild have Republic of China nationality, its members are all foreign steamship companies. In the end, are members of the Commercial Industry Guild also limited to those with Republic of China nationality? Furthermore, if there is such a restriction, then when the managers or concurrently managing companies of foreign steamships are all Republic of China citizens, can they join the Commercial Industry Guild as members? Regarding the interpretation of laws and regulations, a consultation was sent to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation and reply. It is now approved that the case has been resolved by the Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference of this court. Since the representatives of members of the Commercial Industry Guild are limited to those with Republic of China nationality in accordance with Article 14 of the Guild Law, the members they represent are of course subject to this restriction. As for the companies established by Republic of China citizens due to managing or acting as agents for foreign steamships, if there is no foreign capital, they may join the Commercial Industry Guild as members.

### Iron Industry and Others to Levy Difficult Relief Donations on a Fixed Schedule: Two Fen Per City Dan; Temporarily Set for a Period of One Year

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group Fundraising Committee invited the Iron Industry, Hardware Industry, Copper-Tin Industry, and Steel Bar and Old Iron Industry four guilds to discuss the method of collecting relief funds for refugees and issued Public Announcement No. 19, stating: "It is now approved that the Industry Group's letter aims to promote the Iron Industry, Hardware Industry, Copper-Tin Industry, Steel Bar and Old Iron Industry to collect relief funds for refugees. The four guilds held a joint meeting on March 13 to discuss detailed implementation methods. It was decided that all members of the four guilds will collect a relief fee of two fen per city dan from customers when selling hardware, copper-tin, and new and old steel. It will be implemented from the 21st of this month (all goods stored before the 21st of this month will also be charged when shipped on the 21st). It is tentatively set for a period of one year." The record is on file, and the four guilds have reported it to the Industry Group for reporting to the association. It is deeply admired that the four guilds are enthusiastic about good deeds and benefit the refugees. In addition to issuing seals and receipts, it is hoped that all customers will actively donate and support it, which is sincerely hoped. This is a public announcement.

Orphanage Shanghai First Special District Citizen Federation Relief Refugee Committee held the second preparatory meeting of the Women and Children's Orphanage yesterday, with more than 20 committee members present. Chairman Zhou Bangjun decided that from the 18th to the 21st of this month, a radio broadcast propaganda will be held at Huasheng Radio Station, No. 25 Zhili Road, calling on all sectors to support. The list of speakers for the radio station was determined, including Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Zhou Bangjun, and Tao Leqin on the 18th; Xu Xiaochu, Zhang Yichen, Gu Yucang, and Wang Jingdong on the 19th; Cao Zhigong, Wang Jian'e, Wu Ruisheng, and Le Gengbao on the 20th; and Chen Jicheng, Zhu Qizhen, Zhang Deqin, and Liu Zhongying on the 21st. A method for soliciting sponsorships for women and children was also approved.

Fresh Pork Industry The Refugee Relief Fundraising Committee organized by the Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Guild has been promoting it since February 1st, collecting three points from each pork line customer. Due to the enthusiasm of all pork lines and pork customers for public welfare, the results have been remarkable. The actual collection in February was 2,999 yuan and 4 fen in national currency, exceeding the budget. Yesterday, the committee members Xu Zhengke, Li Zhencai, Hong Wenjiang, Xin Xiaokang, Ye Junmao, Dai Guanwu, Wu Shaoxiang, and others decided to hand over all the relief funds collected in February to the Bank of China to issue a ticket, and the accounting director Li Zhencai personally delivered it to the association and issued an official receipt.

Telephone Users The Festival Rescue Committee distributed 70 articles of saving suggestions, earnestly urging all telephone users in the city to save on expenses and transfer them to rescue refugees, and attached four printed articles, filling in the amount of monthly savings and returning them to the association for storage. Many replies have been received in recent days.

### Certain Parties Use Customs Power to Search Huangpu River Ships; Ships to Ningbo and Wenzhou Are Strictly Inspected; Arrested Chinese Customs Cannot Advise

Recently, certain parties have used their power in customs control to add a number of foreign police officers to the water patrol police station to search ships traveling in the Huangpu River and arrest innocent Chinese citizens, directly handing them over to the "Water Military Police Team" of the Water Hotel. The customs authorities cannot advise. Most of the newly added police officers were originally policemen from a certain police station, so they are very skilled in handling affairs. In addition, the Customs has newly established a search class, all of whom are foreign customs officers. Their responsibility is to conduct secret inspections of ships traveling to Ningbo and Wenzhou to suppress anti-Japanese elements.

### Japanese Army Cuts Off Bridge Traffic; US Army Firmly Passes Through; Japanese Army Prevents Ineffectively

The Continental Daily reported that at around 8:30 am yesterday (the 15th), Japanese sentries prohibited all traffic on the Baidu Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, and Sichuan Road Bridge. Although others were not allowed to pass, the United States Marine Corps still passed through the Baidu Bridge yesterday morning. According to the Japanese military spokesman, the Japanese side took this step only as a temporary measure and had no special significance. The bridges reopened and resumed traffic after 20 minutes. When a US Marine Corps truck drove onto the Baidu Bridge, it realized that it had been closed. When the Japanese sentries saw it, they insisted that the US military turn back, but the US military did not comply. After a brief discussion, the Japanese sentries allowed them to pass. When the Baidu Bridge was closed, only the US Marine Corps passed through the bridge. Last night, the Japanese military spokesman replied to the question that the Japanese sentries had "punished" a certain foreign child on the Baidu Bridge.

### Daxilu Real Estate Transactions: More Than 2,000 Gold Per Acre

The North China Daily News reported that the property at No. 25 Daxilu was auctioned yesterday (the 15th) by Nazuo (transliteration) Company in accordance with the instructions of the late owner Anderson. The purchaser was the British English and French Property Co., Ltd., at a price of 186,862 yuan and 5 jiao, equivalent to 2,250 yuan per acre.

### Various Fellow-Provincial Associations Prepare to Revive the Joint Association and Discuss Re-election Methods, with a Meeting to Elect Officers Soon

The Shanghai Fellow-Provincial Associations Joint Association has been established for a long time, but its affairs were suspended because the responsible persons left Shanghai due to various reasons. The previous dinner meeting of various fellow-provincial associations resolved that it was necessary to revive the association. Cao Zhigong, Li Qingfan, Tang Chongshi, Chen Peide, Gu Wensheng, Hu Shouqi, Chen Weifan, Qian Youlan, and others were appointed to prepare for the re-election. Yesterday, a meeting was convened to discuss the re-election methods. The following resolutions were passed: (1) send letters to various fellow-provincial associations to recommend one to three representatives; (2) hold the next dinner meeting for re-election; (3) the convener will select the meeting location.

### The Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders the Consolidation of National Forests, Emphasizing Guidance in Logging and Protection

In view of the rapid progress of construction in the Southwest and the increasing demand for timber, the Ministry of Economic Affairs notes that domestic logging has not been given sufficient attention. Not only is there a lack of reliable data on the ecology of various tree species, but also proper guidance is not provided for logging in various regions, resulting in barren mountains and the destruction of forests due to construction, leading to an irreversible situation. The ministry received a concrete plan for consolidating national forests proposed by Wang Jiaquan, director of the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the National Central Research Institute. The ministry believes that the proposed plan addresses the supply of timber in various regions and the protection of forests, and it is indeed necessary to conduct investigations and research. Therefore, it specifically instructed the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute and the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Academia Sinica to consult and proceed with the plan.

### Shao Shijun: Brothers Suspect Each Other; the Younger Brother Plans to Harm the Elder Brother; Japanese Troops Specially Sent to Protect

The Continental Daily reports that, according to Chinese sources, the residence of Shao Shijun, the "Chief of the Consolidated Tax Bureau" at No. 39 Nanyang Road, was searched by the Public Concession Police Department and the Japanese Military Police. It was claimed that Shao's younger brother had been arrested. Yesterday (the 15th), Shao's confidants acknowledged this. According to Japanese sources, plainclothes Japanese military police were dispatched to Shao's residence for protection, as it was rumored that Shao's cousin, Shao Yunjun, suspected Shao Shijun and planned to attack his residence. Furthermore, according to those close to Shao Shijun, Shao's younger brother was summoned for questioning by the Japanese military police headquarters and was subsequently released.

### Public Works Department Building Adopts Precautionary Measures, Guarded by White Russian Merchant Corps from 7 PM to 8 AM the Next Morning

The North-China Daily News reports that, as of yesterday (the 15th), each entrance of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession is guarded daily by a detachment of the White Russian Merchant Corps, consisting of one officer and thirty members, from 7 PM to 8 AM the next morning. It is reported that these precautionary measures were initially decided upon and implemented on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 13th), with thirty members stationed at each entrance until 8 AM yesterday morning. The detachment that took over the guard during the day is stationed in the International Settlement Volunteer Corps gymnasium on the fourth floor of the Public Works Department. Another detachment is stationed in the International Settlement Volunteer Corps barracks at No. 6 The Bund and can rush to the Public Works Department within minutes in the event of any possible disturbances. It is reported that these precautions were taken by the Commander of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps due to rumors of disturbances occurring on Tuesday evening. It is also reported that these precautions will be implemented indefinitely. Although no other information has been obtained regarding this matter, it is believed that these precautions are related to the ongoing campaign to prevent terrorist activities. Last night, the entrances of the Public Works Department were all guarded by the Merchant Corps.

### Postal Remittance Bureau Resumes Remittances to the Entire Guangdong Province, Charging a Supplementary Water Fee of Two Cents per Yuan, with Detailed Regulations for Remittance Fees

The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau previously suspended remittances to the entire Guangdong Province due to frequent bombings, unstable local conditions, and obstructed transportation. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the bureau yesterday that remittances to the entire Guangdong Province have been resumed, and remittance drafts are being issued as usual. A supplementary water fee of two cents per yuan is uniformly charged for the entire region (except for the Shantou postal area). Remittance fees vary and are subject to detailed regulations. Furthermore, the fee collection method for telegraphic money orders, which had previously been reduced, has now been increased. The method is recorded below: In addition to the normal remittance fee, telegraphic money orders with no more than 20 words cost 1.25 yuan (previously 1 yuan), plus a handling fee of 0.1 yuan. For those exceeding 20 words, an additional 0.125 yuan (previously 0.1 yuan) is charged. A brief message from the remitter costs 0.25 yuan per word (previously 0.2 yuan). Remittances to Beijing, Hankou, Xiamen, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Kaifeng, Jiangxi, and other places are still unavailable.

### Second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week: Today is Youth Propaganda Day, with a Joint Declaration by Youth from All Circles, Strictly Adhering to the Outline of the Chairman's Instructions

Today is the sixth day of the Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week held by the Shanghai Special City Party Department, leading all circles. The youth of all circles in the city have issued a joint declaration, which is recorded as follows:

Spirit of Sacrifice

Beloved youth of the city, youth has always occupied a supremely glorious page in the revolutionary history of our country. As evidenced by the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution and the overthrow of the warlords in the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China, the majority of participants were mainly youth. This glorious historical record of sacrifice and struggle can truly be immortalized along with our Chinese nation. Furthermore, as evidenced by the four-month-long bloody battle of Shanghai in the past year, the majority of those who directly participated in the front-line combat, spraying their blood on the enemy and extracting a corresponding price, creating a moving historical record, as well as those who indirectly contributed to the war by doing various political, educational, social, and medical work, were probably still the youth of all circles.

Anti-War Sentiment

Now, even though we are in the isolated island of Shanghai, our anti-war sentiment continues to increase with the years of occupation. Therefore, many of us in the youth ranks have already gone to the interior to serve in the military, join guerrilla forces, and engage in other work that is beneficial to the anti-war effort. Even those who remain on this isolated island are united in their hatred of the enemy and are constantly making various preparations for the anti-war effort and national construction. Patriotic actions are still being carried out continuously.

Future Goals

Although our past efforts have already achieved considerable results, in this time when the country is facing an unprecedented national crisis and the anti-war effort is entering its second phase, thinking of the country's earnest expectations for youth and the great responsibility that youth should bear for the country, we feel that our past contributions are still somewhat unworthy of the country. It must be known that in extraordinary times, every one of us youth should have extraordinary actions. Therefore, we list three things as our common goals for future efforts:

First, support Chairman Chiang's letter to the youth of the nation—we must strictly abide by the points instructed by Chairman Chiang in his letter to the youth of the nation: (1) Participate in wartime mobilization—contribute to the best of our knowledge and ability, regard struggle as our duty, and consider sacrifice as a matter of course; (2) Receive various training—when necessary, we must go to the interior to receive military training in order to acquire the skills to defend the nation and the way to be loyal to the Party and patriotic, and receive political training in order to acquire the necessary political qualities to build a nation based on the Three Principles of the People; (3) Promote cultural construction—youth in the intellectual community must automatically participate in the movement to eliminate illiteracy, coordinate to carry out correspondence education, and strive to participate in anti-war propaganda, so that the general public has correct political awareness and a considerable level of culture; (4) Promote labor service—understand Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy that "life is for service," participate in social productive labor to develop the national economy, and at the same time, go deep into the countryside to get close to the masses, and win the faith of the general public with our work achievements; (5) Cultivate production skills—pay attention to the cultivation of scientific knowledge, so that our consciousness, words, and deeds are all scientific, develop a new national character that is organized, methodical, precise, and practical, and at the same time, receive technical training, develop production and labor skills, so that the majority of youth can serve in agriculture, commerce, roads, mines, electricity, and industry, so that the country's great construction can be accelerated.

Second, vigorously implement spiritual mobilization—we must strictly abide by the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and its implementation measures formulated by Chairman Chiang: (1) Clearly recognize the common goal—concentrate our will and concentrate our strength to make efforts for the nation first, the nation first, the military first, and victory first; (2) Practice national salvation morality—be absolutely loyal to the country, practice the great righteousness of the nation, and evolve into the virtues of benevolence, righteousness, trust, and peace; (3) Establish a national founding faith—establish the Three Principles of the People created by Dr. Sun Yat-sen as the highest principle for China's national founding, so that the country we want to build in our ideals is independent, free, and equal externally, and of the people, by the people, and for the people internally; (4) Transform the spirit—correct the life of drunken dreams and death, develop a vigorous spirit, eliminate the habit of making do, break the selfish and self-serving attempts, and correct the divergent and complicated thoughts; (5) Mobilize leadership—in accordance with the mobilization implementation measures, practice what we preach, and make continuous progress directly and indirectly, so that we can achieve satisfactory results in the shortest possible time.

Third, earnestly implement the New Life Movement—we must strictly abide by the New Life Movement Outline advocated by Chairman Chiang, and earnestly implement the four virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and achieve the eight characters of neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, and plainness. Therefore, we must: (1) Militarize life—thoroughly eliminate the past habits of decadence, laziness, retreat, depression, and neglect, in order to cultivate good habits such as valuing shame, advocating martial arts, being hardworking and enduring hardship, loving the country, valuing credit, and advocating simplicity, frugality, discipline, and punctuality; (2) Artisticize life—be cautious, humble, and harmonious in personal conduct, be sincere and generous in dealing with people, be quick and thorough in handling affairs, and be thrifty and honest in receiving things; (3) Productize life—in terms of funds, we must advocate thrift and savings to increase social resources; in terms of labor, we must pay attention to cherishing time and operating, and strive for increased quantity and quality; in terms of materials, we must pay attention to promoting domestic products and strive for frugality and protection of goods.

### Puppet "Central China Government" Establishes Opium Monopoly Bureau in Shanghai

The puppet "Central China Government" has been brewing the opium monopoly in Shanghai for a long time. It is now learned that a person named Zhu Xue (transliteration) has been appointed as the director of the Shanghai branch of the "Opium Monopoly Bureau." Director Zhu arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. His office is generally located in western Shanghai, but has not yet been decided. The "Shanghai Opium Cooperative Bureau" is managed by the puppet "Central China Government."

### Consular Body Hosts Farewell Banquet for Portuguese Consul General

The North-China Daily News reports that Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai, Alves, has been transferred to New York as the Portuguese Consul General. The consuls of the Shanghai consular body hosted a farewell banquet at the German Ball Club yesterday (the 15th) to thank him for his service to the Shanghai consular body. During the banquet, Italian Consul General and doyen of the consular corps, Nilon, presented Mr. Alves with a gift on behalf of all consuls, and delivered a speech praising Mr. Alves for his valuable work in Shanghai. Mr. Alves also delivered a farewell speech. The consuls general of various countries in Shanghai attended the meeting.

### "Great Way Police" Arrest People Across Borders, Intervened and Prevented by Patrol Police, Rice Shop Employee Calls Puppet Police Traitors, Enraged and Attempt to Illegally Arrest

The English-language China Press reports that around 8:00 PM yesterday (the 15th), the "Great Way Police" illegally arrested people on the roads of the Public Concession, but were intervened and prevented by the patrol team of the police department's reserve team. Subsequently, a team of British East Surrey Regiment soldiers, Japanese military police, and Police Chief Nuke were all dispatched. This incident occurred on Edinburgh Road, where no fewer than 35 "Great Way Police" were gathered. When the reserve police saw them arresting an employee of a rice shop at No. 456-8 Edinburgh Road, they stepped forward to question why. The "police chief" of the "Great Way Police" claimed that it was because the shop employee called them traitors, so they were arrested. The reserve police ordered them to stay in front of the rice shop and reported the incident by telephone. Soon, Nuke arrived with a patrol team from the East Surrey Regiment and several Japanese military police. After a brief conversation, the "Great Way Police" released the shop employee and walked out of the Concession Road.

### Japanese Puppets Fail to Prohibit Legal Tender, Legal Tender Appreciation Increases, Increasing to 2.5% This Week, Banks in Tianjin Concession Accept

The Continental Daily reports that although North China nominally abolished the Chinese national currency, it did not make legal tender disappear in the British and French concessions of Tianjin, nor did it depreciate when exchanged for the puppet currency of Beijing. On the contrary, in recent days, the appreciation of legal tender exchanged for puppet currency has indeed increased. On the 9th of this month, the appreciation of legal tender was 0.63%, but by the beginning of this week, it had increased to as much as 2.5%. All Chinese and foreign banks in the Tianjin Concession handle Chinese national currency, no different from before March 11.

### Accountants Practicing Should Apply for Registration, During the Administrative Suspension in Shanghai, Submit Directly to the Ministry for Convenience

Since the administrative organs of this city have temporarily ceased to exercise their functions, how should accountants practicing in Shanghai apply for registration? The Ministry of Economic Affairs has stipulated and informed the Ministry of Judicial Administration for reference. The original letter stated that Article 10 of the Accountants Regulations stipulates that when an accountant is registered, the industrial administrative organ should report to the Ministry and notify the courts of the province and city for record.

In addition to instructing the Shanghai Accountants Association, we should also send a letter to your ministry, requesting you to instruct the courts in Shanghai to comply and hope to receive a reply.

### Negotiation for Compensation for Ship Price Turns into Frame-Up, Judgment: Both Parties Acquitted and Released, False Accusation Issue to Be Investigated Again

Shi Zhongdi, a gentry merchant from Nanxun, has been in Shanghai for refuge since the war. Shi later learned that a yacht he owned, worth six or seven thousand yuan, had been taken away by Wang Youren in the area under some pretext. Shi was difficult to understand, but because Wang had potential power, and Nanxun was unable to negotiate with him after it fell, he had to endure the pain and let it go for the time being. Recently, Shi suddenly met Wang Youren in Shanghai, so he proposed a negotiation, asking for the return of the ship. Wang also knew that he was at a disadvantage and was willing to compensate a considerable price for the ship. However, the details could not be resolved at once, so it was decided to discuss a solution in detail in Room 466 of the Dahua Hotel last Wednesday. When the time came, both parties arrived as promised. As a result of the talks, Wang compensated Shi with 3,400 yuan.

He was willing to pay 400 yuan first, and the rest would be paid later as the opportunity arose. Shi expressed satisfaction with this, and just as he was booking the room, the hotel owner suddenly instigated someone to report to the Old Gate Police Station, claiming that Shi had gathered gangsters and illegally detained Wang. Chief Inspector Chen Yonggui, Inspector Wang Shusen, and Detective Cao Qishan rushed to the scene and arrested Shi and his fellow villagers Zhu Sanbao, Gao Changying, Tang Acai, Zhang Sanbao, Wu Shunbao, Yang Sanbao, and Chen Agen, and sent them to the First Special Court.

To Request Dominance and were detained. Yesterday morning, this case was continued by Judge Feng Shide in the First Criminal Court. Shi Zhongdi hired lawyer Qian Zheng to defend him, and the police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the behavior of the defendants in this case was not enough to constitute a crime, so he would no longer prosecute and asked for the defendants to be released. Lawyer Qian said that the defendants had suffered a great deal of mental pain due to the plaintiff's false accusation and would file a false accusation lawsuit. Judge Feng Shide then ordered that the eight people including Shi Zhongdi should be released since the police would not prosecute. As for the issue of false accusation, if the police considered it necessary to investigate, the police were free to do so, and then adjourned the court.

### Police Station Searched Central Hotel Again Last Night, Detaining Seventy or Eighty Soil Dealers and Opium Addicts, Also Went to Shenzhou Hotel for Group Search

The Public Concession Police Department issued another emergency mobilization order at 9:00 PM last night, ordering all reserves of the White Russian team to join the regular patrol, departing from the department in police cars, and heading straight to the Central Hotel at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Hubei Road for another large-scale search. At that time, the regiment took over the guard, temporarily cutting off traffic around the hotel. All reserves were divided into several small teams according to their organization, led by patrol officers, using extremely swift means to search each floor. All passengers were ordered to return to their rooms and were not allowed to linger or walk in the entrances and exits, so the order was very good, with no noise or commotion. However, as a result of the search, twenty or thirty opium dens were found to be used for drug use. Because these people had no way of knowing the news in advance and hiding, they were unable to escape when the patrol officers arrived because they were prohibited from acting arbitrarily, so they were all like fish in a pot, wiped out in one fell swoop. It is reported that the number of drug dealers and drug addicts captured reached seventy or eighty people, and opium lamps and pipes were piled up into huge bundles. In addition, a lot of opium was also seized. The patrol officers then drove them down to the bottom floor in batches, escorted them onto prison vehicles, and sent them to the police station for investigation. A total of six vehicles were transported in succession. It is heard that the record of breaking up drug dens in the recent period is truly impressive. After the search team waited for the prisoners to be escorted away at about 10:00 PM, they turned to the Shenzhou Hotel at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Fuzhou Road for the same search. The search lasted about one hour, and the team returned at 11:00 PM at midnight. As a result, it is said that nothing was found.

### Embezzling Famine Relief Food and Injuring People to Death, Shen Zhiguang and Zhao Weilian Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, The Remaining Three Criminals Also Severely Sentenced, Seized Soybeans and Rice Returned to the Relief Association

Shen Zhiguang, Zhao Weilian, Song Meixi, Cao Linsen, and Cai Zuying, managers of the Fahua 42nd Reception Center under the Pudong Building Branch of the Shanghai Charity Organization United Disaster Relief Association, were found to be engaged in malfeasance for personal gain, embezzling famine relief food, selling it privately, and sharing the spoils. When Zhang Boyuan from Baoshan, a refugee, discovered this, he secretly reported it to the branch, which angered Shen et al. Zhang was privately tortured, suspended, and beaten all over, resulting in his death. Subsequently, Liu Shaokui, Chief Inspector of the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police, Inspector Song Bingzheng, Detective Lang Guangchun, and others learned of the matter and arrested Shen et al., sending them to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law, requesting severe punishment to punish the traitors and warn others. During the trial, a suspicious drama of changing the color of the corpse coffin and exchanging a male corpse for a female corpse once occurred. After investigation, the Special Court thoroughly investigated and the case was concluded. The details have been reported in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide announced the verdict in the First Criminal Court. Shen Zhiguang and Zhao Weilian were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of public rights for the crime of jointly and continuously encroaching on public interest property, and each was sentenced to life imprisonment and life-long deprivation of public rights for the crime of jointly injuring a person to death, with the execution of life imprisonment and life-long deprivation of public rights.

### Wu Bocheng Kidnapping Case, One Suspect Arrested, Still Detained at Police Station for Interrogation

The Continental Daily reports that the kidnapping case of Wu Bocheng, a former clerk of a pawnshop in Jiangyin, is still under investigation by the Public Concession Police Department yesterday (the 15th). Although the police department has released little information about the crime that occurred on Sunday morning, it is heard that a Chinese suspect has been arrested and is now under interrogation. It depends on the results of the current investigation whether he will be prosecuted in the First Special Court. According to reports, Wu was kidnapped at about 6:30 AM on Sunday morning at his residence at No. 631 Matterhorn Road. At that time, four people entered his residence, pulled out handguns, prohibited Wu's family from acting, forced Wu to get out of bed and get dressed, and then abducted him onto a taxi and fled. After the kidnappers left, Wu's family went to a relative's house on Gordon Road, presumably to discuss ways to release Wu. Unexpectedly, at 8:40 AM, two kidnappers of Wu also entered the residence of Wu's relatives and demanded a ransom. The kidnappers fled only because the police were called.

### Mistaken Medication Leads to Death: Pharmaceutical Factory Accused, Court Summons

Madam Zhang Liang of Hangzhou, last autumn, because her father, Liang Qitang, suffered from malaria, was instructed by a Western doctor to purchase "Quinine" injection produced by the Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory to treat her father. Unexpectedly, before one box of injections was finished, Qitang died. Simultaneously, it was discovered that the injected solution was not "Quinine," but "Sodium Arsanilate." Apparently, during packaging, the "Sodium Arsanilate" injection was mistakenly placed in a "Quinine" box. The price of "Sodium Arsanilate" is cheaper than "Quinine." Thus, Madam Zhang Liang suspected the pharmaceutical factory of fraudulent intent, and after multiple unsuccessful attempts to negotiate, she hired lawyer Zou Shengzu to file a private prosecution with the Second Special District Court. Yesterday at 10 AM, Judge Li Weishen presided over the case in the Second Court. The defendant, Bao Guochang, along with defense lawyer Jiang Yiping, appeared in court for questioning. As additional witnesses need to be summoned, the trial was postponed to 10 AM on the 27th. Defendant Bao Guochang was released on his own recognizance, promising to appear when summoned.

### Fire Destroys Over 30 Buildings, Three Injured

Yesterday at 12:02 PM, a fire broke out at No. 709, Rue Robert (present-day West Nanjing Road), Shanghai, quickly spreading to Nos. 707, 705, 703, and 701, as well as Nos. 711, 713, and 715, destroying eight buildings along the alley and twenty residential units within Lane 715, from No. 1 to No. 35. In total, over 30 buildings were destroyed. The fire lasted for four hours. Upon receiving the alarm, fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene to extinguish the blaze, which was finally put out around 2 PM. A firefighter from Brigade No. 62 was injured in the lips while bravely fighting the fire. A male and a female resident were also severely injured. The female resident, with head injuries, was sent to Tongren Hospital. The male resident, with leg injuries, was sent to the Red Cross for treatment. The cause of the fire is rumored to be careless cooking, and is currently under investigation by the police.

### Japanese Car Hits Pedestrians, Treats Lives Like Grass

Recently, numerous incidents of Japanese cars hitting pedestrians have occurred in the Hongkou District. At 1:30 PM on the 15th of this month, a Japanese driver struck three Chinese pedestrians near Wusong Road. According to eyewitnesses, the three pedestrians were crossing the road when the car sped towards them without sounding its horn. One victim, Jin Wenyuan (transliteration), 49 years old, suffered head injuries. Another, Yu Sheng (transliteration), suffered a right leg injury. The third victim, whose name is unknown, sustained only minor injuries. Regarding the four Chinese hit by a Japanese oil truck near Jiaxing Road and Avenue Foch (present-day Yan'an West Road) on Tuesday afternoon, the Japanese side claims that two of the Chinese were severely injured, while the other two were only slightly injured. They have been sent to the Japanese Naval Hospital for treatment.

### Widowed Daughter-in-Law Destitute, Sues Father-in-Law for Neglect, Demands Living Expenses, Court Orders Mediation, Postpones Trial

Xi Defu, a local resident, has lived in Shachang Street in the Nanshi district for generations and owns dozens of houses there. After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Nanshi fell to the enemy, and all his property was reduced to ashes. Xi has gone from being a member of the propertied class to someone completely destitute. Xi has two sons; the elder son was adopted into his deceased elder brother's family, and the younger son died of illness in August 1920. The younger daughter-in-law, Wang Weilian, vowed to remain chaste and relied on her in-laws for support. When the Shanghai Battle began, Xi led his entire family to seek refuge at the Su Tai Hotel on Daxin Street in the British Concession. In April of last year, his elder son rented a residence in Yugu Village and moved there. His mother, Wang Weilian, returned to her natal home. Upon returning to Su Tai, she found that Xi and his family had already moved, and she was unable to find out their new address. She had no choice but to temporarily return to her mother's home. Several months later, she learned where her in-laws were living and went to seek their support. Unexpectedly, Xi Defu completely changed his previous attitude of kindness toward this young widow and treated her with contempt, causing her to feel utterly destitute. Despite attempts by relatives and friends of both parties to mediate, no agreement was reached. Therefore, Wang Weilian hired lawyer Hu Yongsheng to sue her father-in-law, Xi Defu, in the First Special District Court for neglect. She claimed that she is currently only 26 years old and requested the court to order the defendant to pay her monthly living expenses of 30 national currency dollars until she turns 60, totaling 11,520 dollars. She also pleaded that, given her poverty, she be temporarily exempted from paying court fees. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ni opened the court for trial. The plaintiff was absent. Lawyer Hu presented the plaintiff's claims and the requested amount, stating that, as the uncle-in-law, the defendant has a legal obligation to support the plaintiff. When questioned, Xi Defu claimed that there are currently eight people in his household and that his family assets have been exhausted. Therefore, he requested the court to reject the plaintiff's suit. If the plaintiff is willing to return, he will continue to live together with her. Regarding the houses in the city, they were sold before the war due to debts of 22,000 taels of gold, receiving a price of 28,000 taels. After deducting the debts, the remaining 6,000 taels were in the form of a check from the day the war began, so he has not received a single cent. Judge Ni, noting that a mediation had taken place before the lawsuit, advised them to continue to seek mediation outside the court and ordered a postponement for further trial.

### Escorting a Prostitute, Robbed of Over Two Hundred Gold

Around 9 PM the night before last, two elegantly dressed young men checked into the Yangzi Hotel on Yunnan Road. A hotel attendant escorted them to Room 726 on the seventh floor. They paid the room fee for the day and wrote "Shen Jun" on the guest register. They then called the Lequn Escort Service and requested a prostitute. The service sent a woman named Huifang to respond to the call. The two men spent time with the prostitute until around 5 AM yesterday morning. Suddenly, they forcibly took the gold bracelet, gold ring, and cash in her purse, totaling over 200 yuan. Fearing she would raise an alarm, they tied her hands with rope and stuffed her mouth with a towel, preventing her from shouting. The two men then opened the door and fled. After forcefully breaking free from the ropes binding her hands, the woman hurried back to the service and reported the incident to the Zhabei Police Station, requesting an investigation.

### Guangdong Middle School and Guangzhao Association Hold Variety Show to Raise Funds for Guangdong and Guangxi Refugees

### Girl Sues to Break Engagement Arranged in Childhood, Fiancé Pursues Compensation According to Law

Shen Chiquan, a young woman from Songjiang, also known as Guizhu, is in the prime of her youth. When she was young and living in her hometown, her parents, through a matchmaker, arranged for her to be engaged to Yao Ruixin in 1928. At that time, Yao was nine years old, and the girl was twelve. Because they were from the same village, they were close friends since childhood, and they pledged to be together for life, growing even more intimate. As they grew older and understood things, they never questioned their previous engagement. They also exchanged numerous letters and sweet words. However, after the outbreak of the war and the fall of Songjiang, the villagers were unable to live peacefully and fled to Shanghai with their families. The Shen family rented a residence at No. 6 Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, near Avenue Edward VII (present-day Yan'an East Road). Initially, she still obeyed the arrangement. Later, Ms. Shen suddenly hired a lawyer to send a letter to her fiancé, Yao Ruixin, stating that the engagement had not been agreed to by her personally at the time and that she could not acknowledge it. She demanded its abolition in resolute terms. After receiving the letter, Yao believed that since she had expressed her unwillingness to grow old together with him, there was no possibility of holding a wedding in the future. However, he was unwilling to sacrifice the expenses incurred during the engagement ceremony without cause. Therefore, he hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a lawsuit against Shen Chiquan in the First Special District Court for the losses suffered due to the termination of the engagement. The lawsuit detailed the engagement process, stating that he had paid 60 yuan in betrothal gifts and various gifts such as gold bracelets and gold rings, costing a total of 700 yuan. Although the engagement took place in childhood, it occurred before the promulgation of the Family Code of the Civil Code and was naturally not subject to age restrictions. Furthermore, the defendant reaffirmed the engagement after reaching adulthood, which is evidenced by letters and undeniable. The plaintiff does not have any of the circumstances mentioned in Articles 976, Section 1 to 9 of the Civil Code. Therefore, the non-negligent party should, according to law, pursue compensation for losses of 700 national currency dollars. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Fu Lan opened the court for trial. The Shen family had already moved from Xinping Lane to another location, making it impossible to summon Ms. Shen to court. Therefore, the plaintiff's lawyer, Wu Peng, requested a public notice for service, which was approved by the court.

### Young Woman Attempts to Elop With Lover, Steals and Embezzles Stocks, Brother Discovers and Reports to Police

Li Chaoshan, a Guangdong native, previously worked for the Taikoo Shipping Company. In 1934, Li suddenly died of illness, leaving behind an estate of 50,000 yuan, which was managed by his wife, Zhao. Li had one daughter and two sons. The daughter, Li Zhiming, was 25 years old and not yet married. The son, Songjiang, was only fifteen, and the younger son was even younger. Therefore, the household affairs were usually entrusted to the eldest daughter, Zhiming, to manage. This year, when Li Songjiang turned twenty, he suddenly remembered that his father had 650 shares of Shanghai Public Bus Company stock, worth 9,100 yuan, which were due for dividend settlement. However, after his mother searched, the stock could not be found. Upon inquiring with the Public Bus Company, they learned that his sister, Li Zhiming, in collusion with his younger brother's godfather, Yao Keming, had secretly stolen and sold them for their own use. After discovering the truth, and learning that his sister was planning to go abroad to India with Yao, Li Songjiang reported the incident to the Chengdu Road Police Station a few days ago, who sent detectives to arrest Li Zhiming. Yao is still at large. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case, requesting permission for detention. When questioned, Li Zhiming confessed to stealing and embezzling the stock, but claimed that the proceeds had been used to build a house in Jiangwan and for investment in business. Li Songjiang and his mother, Li Zhao, also filed a case, proving that the defendant had secretly sold the stock without their knowledge. Judge Meng ordered Li to be detained pending further investigation.

### Foreigner's Body Found in Hongkou

Similar to the Murder of a Car Driver. According to the French Shanghai Journal, assassinations have recently occurred in the Hongkou area.

### Son, Daughter-in-Law, and Granddaughter Died in Fire, Elderly Woman With No Means of Support, Iron Bed Shop Destroyed by Fire Prepares to Reopen, Elderly Woman Sues for Compensation, Court Orders Mediation

The Yongxinglong Iron Bed Shop at No. 334 Avenue Edward VII was set on fire on January 14th of this year at 1 PM by an employee named Han Baolin, who left a fire unattended in the attic on the second floor, where rosin and gasoline were stored, causing the entire shop to be destroyed. Many people were killed or injured. The responsible Han Baolin was arrested by the police and sentenced to two years in prison by the First Special District Court. The most tragic victim was Zhang, a native of Zhenhai, who rented a room on the third floor of the shop. Zhang, whose name was Minxun, his wife, Qian, and daughter, Lingling, were all unable to escape because the staircase was burned through first. Although they were rescued from the fire by firefighters, they were severely burned and died one after another. Only Zhang's 51-year-old mother, Madam Zai, was away on business before the fire and escaped the disaster. Now, Madam Zai, whose son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter all died tragically, claims that the owner of Yongxinglong, Fan Delong, is still at large and that she has no means of support for the future. Therefore, she has hired lawyer Chen Wencan to file a criminal charge against Fan and Han Baolin, holding them responsible for causing death through negligence, requesting that they be severely punished according to law, and that they be ordered to pay for the funeral expenses of the three deceased and her monthly living expenses of 30 yuan until she turns 60, totaling 4,576.50 national currency dollars. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen opened the court for trial. Since Han has already been sentenced and is poor, he has no ability to pay compensation. He advised the plaintiff to withdraw the lawsuit against Han. As for Fan Delong, although he suffered a fire, his shop had fire insurance, and he received a large sum of compensation after the fire and is currently preparing to reopen. Judge Shen stated that it is impossible for the defendant to not offer any compensation for the losses and ordered both parties to mediate outside the court. The case was postponed for further trial.

### Our Country's Legal Scholar, Honor in Brussels, Xiao Jingfang Earns Special Doctorate in Law

(Brussels Correspondence) Dr. Xiao Jingfang (Jin Fang), Secretary of our country's Embassy in Belgium, a native of Nanxi, Sichuan, studied in France for many years. After returning to China, he held important positions in the judicial circles of Beijing and Shanghai. He is deeply cultivated in legal studies. He has often published articles in legal journals such as the China Law Journal and the Sanwu Law Society Law Quarterly, and has translated "Code of Private International Law" by the famous international law scholar Dr. A.S.D. Bustamante. Since coming here last year, he has continued to conduct in-depth research at the University of Brussels in his spare time. His thesis for the Special Doctorate in Law (DocteurShecialen Droit) is themed "Evolution of Chinese Constitutionalism," divided into four parts and eighteen chapters, totaling five hundred and forty pages, with three subtitles: (1) Since Belgium's independence in 1831, changes in its public law regarding freedom of association have increasingly strengthened the power of social groups; (2) Research on Belgian courts and other institutions that exercise part of judicial power; (3) Although the separation of powers is a political principle, Belgian public law strives for its implementation, but there is no strict regulation. After formally submitting it to the Faculty of Law of the university in July of this year, the university organized an examination committee to review it and deemed it qualified. The university then held an internal examination debate on the 7th of this month. All professors of the faculty attended. As the topic was the entire constitutional issue of China, involving the ancient constitutional form of China, the university specially invited Mr. Escarra, a Chinese government consultant, professor at the University of Paris, and a famous China expert, to attend and express his opinions. The debate lasted for more than two hours, and the professors began to assess it. As a result, they were satisfied and the Dean of the Faculty of Law formally announced its approval. It is known that the degree of Special Doctorate in Law is a degree that qualifies one to become a university professor in Belgium. After the thesis is approved, one must publicly lecture once to see if one has the ability to serve as a university professor. Therefore, Dr. Xiao publicly lectured at the university for two hours from 3 PM to 5 PM on the 21st of this month, entitled "Historical and Theoretical Analysis of the Five-Power Constitution." After the lecture, the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Roland (Rilin), and the Dean of the Faculty of Law, Soudan, successively praised and paid tribute to Dr. Xiao in public. It is heard that Dr. Xiao is the first Chinese to obtain this degree in France, adding much glory to our country.

Traditional Chinese Medicine and Nutritional Therapy

### Eating Vinegar

— Bai Shui

If a person is told they are "eating vinegar," they will not be very happy; because the term "eating vinegar" is usually considered not very good. In fact, in our daily nutritional care, regularly eating some vinegar is very much in line with hygiene. This is because food often carries microorganisms. These microorganisms are very dangerous when eaten. However, some microorganisms can be eliminated when they encounter acidic things. Our stomachs have a kind of gastric acid, which is a good medicine for killing bacteria. But sometimes our gastric acid is not strong, so the microorganisms attached to the food are very dangerous. But if we eat some vinegar at the same time as eating, it will be safer.

Chinese people often have a small dish of vinegar on the table when they eat, which is very much in line with hygiene. Especially when cholera is prevalent in the summer, if you dip every chopstick of food in the vinegar dish, you must have vinegar when eating crab, possibly because there are microorganisms in the crab meat that have not been killed by cooking. Therefore, vinegar is not only a condiment but also a necessary sanitary product. (Cun Ren notes: Those with stomach diseases and excessive stomach acid should not eat too much vinegar, and children should not eat vinegar, especially during and around puberty. Women should also avoid eating vinegar before menstruation.)

### A Few Words on Vegetables

— Wu Gongwang

When it comes to daily diet, Chinese people often only seek deliciousness and palatability, without asking about the composition of the ingredients; even the gains and losses of cooking seasonings are rarely studied. For example, many people like to eat mustard greens, but they do not know that mustard greens are very refreshing to eat, but eating too much is more harmful than beneficial. Also, vegetables such as dry celery, leek sprouts, salted radishes, sour bamboo shoots, and salted mustard greens contain very little water and are difficult to digest for ordinary people, let alone for those who are sick. Kelp, golden needles, and wood ears can be used as vegetables and are also commonly eaten by us, but they are not suitable for patients. As for cooking and seasoning, such as onions, garlic, ginger, pepper, fennel, as well as soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, etc., are commonly used in cooking and drinks, and are also daily necessities, but they are too spicy and fragrant and should not be used in excess. Therefore, food materials must be selected for their clearness, moistness, and ease of digestion to be beneficial, and the seasoning should not be biased, and should ultimately be appropriate to the taste; so as not to be harmed by diet.

### Fujian Rock Sugar

— Zhang Huailin

Rock sugar is very effective in treating coughs, so it has been passed down as a folk remedy, but now, because the method of making rock sugar has changed, and the symptoms of coughs are also different, eating rock sugar for coughs is not only useless, but also harmful.

First, let's talk about sugar making: In the past, the traditional method of making sugar used sugarcane, pure sugarcane juice, boiled into white sugar, and divided into three types. The top layer of sugar formed a very thin piece, like chicken foot ice, called rock sugar, which is old-fashioned Jian ice, slightly yellow and not white, fresh and clean but not very transparent. It is the essence of sugarcane juice, with a fresh and sweet taste, and can moisten the lungs and relieve coughs. For coughs with phlegm and coughs caused by pulmonary tuberculosis in the elderly, holding a piece in the mouth can lighten severe coughs and stop mild ones.

Recently, old-fashioned rock sugar is less common on the market. The method of making and composition of white rock sugar are completely different from before. The rock sugar of the past was the top layer of sugar, which is the essence of sugarcane juice, but the rock sugar of today is the dregs of sugar, the bottom layer of sugar. The raw materials for making sugar now are sugarcane as the highest grade, followed by radish, barley, potatoes, etc., but the raw materials for making rock sugar are sugar feet. First, sugar is extracted to make white sugar, and then yellow sugar. The remaining sugar feet are then refined, and bone meal and other substances are used to make rock sugar. Therefore, in the past, rock sugar was more expensive than white sugar, but now rock sugar is cheaper than white sugar. Since the method of making rock sugar has undergone such a big change, the effect of treating coughs has also been completely lost.

Now, rock sugar cannot only not treat coughs, but it is also harmful and useless. Rock sugar made from sugar feet is sweet and greasy in nature, and the greasiness causes phlegm. Trying to moisten the throat and lungs can actually cause phlegm and choking, especially for coughs caused by wind-cold or colds. Eating rock sugar can make the cough worse, and even cause changes. Therefore, to treat a cough, you must buy old-fashioned Fujian rock sugar.

### Hemoptysis

— Gong Xingzhai

Hemoptysis is considered an important symptom in medicine, but the causes are different, and the treatments are also different. Some are caused by long-term coughing damaging the lung collaterals, so the blood is streaked with blood. Some are caused by accumulated heat damaging the stomach, so the blood is coughed up in mouthfuls. Some are caused by injuries and accumulated blood stasis that has not been cleared, so the blood is coughed up in clots. Some are caused by sudden anger damaging the liver and preventing blood from being contained, so the blood flows out freely. The treatment methods are mainly to clear the blood and fire, and to remove blood stasis and promote new blood production. After the human body loses blood, it will naturally be damaged and weakened, causing people to feel cold. Therefore, in the treatment methods of clearing fire and blood, food is also used to regulate it.

The prescription for treating hemoptysis is the Seven Black Soup, which uses winter mulberry leaf charcoal, side cypress leaf charcoal, schizonepeta stalk charcoal, raw black beans, stir-fried cooked black beans, and black dates, all simmered together in one bowl of soup. Separately, eat raw egg soup as an introduction, and take it for three days to stop the bleeding. Continue to take it for ten days to expect a full recovery. The severity of the disease varies, and the dosage can be adjusted accordingly. Do not neglect it because the taste of the medicine is mild.

When medicine is combined with food, the effect is pure but slow. This prescription uses raw eggs as an introduction, using its vitality to provide a clear supplement, so its benefit is significant. However, nutritional care during illness should focus on the meaning of the word "nourishment." Do not let patients use it as an excuse to indulge in food during illness, and attention should also be paid.

### Organ Therapy Invented Long Ago in China (3)

— Xie Yenong

Pork kidneys: The urban environment is complex, life is tiring, and various desires abound, all of which can damage the spirit and impair the body, forming various symptoms of weakness. Among them, kidney deficiency is the most common. The manifestations of kidney weakness range from mild symptoms such as back pain, dizziness, mental fatigue, thinness, and insufficient memory. The treatment method should start with pork kidneys. The function of pork kidneys to tonify the kidneys has been described in detail in ancient books. However, when cooking, the kidneys must be repeatedly washed, sliced ​​thinly, and the water brought to a boil first. Add a little salt, then add the kidney slices and boil for one or two rolls. The more tender, the better. If the weakness becomes more severe, then the disease will also deepen; or there will be soreness in the waist and knees, or cold in the lower body, or nocturnal emission without dreams, or impotence, and ringing in the ears. At this time, in addition to the kidney still being a symptomatic medicine, medicines should also be added according to the symptoms. For soreness in the waist and knees, add eucommia bark and cook together. For cold in the lower body, add aconite and cook together. For nocturnal emission without dreams, add lotus seeds and fox nuts and cook together. For impotence, add rehmannia glutinosa and turtle shell and cook together. For tinnitus, add wolfberries and cook together. Weakness is a chronic disease that cannot be recovered without long-term recuperation. If the above organ food therapy is used, it will be more convenient and economical in terms of time and money.

Hearts of sheep, pigs, and cows: As the saying goes, "heart disease still needs heart medicine to cure." However, the so-called heart disease here refers to psychological heart disease caused by deep thought, not diseases of the essence of the heart. Therefore, do not discuss it. The real heart disease is heart weakness, such as palpitations, restlessness, fright, insomnia, and forgetfulness, all of which are caused by the heart's atrial contraction failing to maintain its normal state, causing blood circulation disorders. All these symptoms can be treated by eating the hearts of cows, sheep, and pigs. Now, I will describe their respective functions as follows: (1) For heart deficiency, spontaneous sweating, insomnia, and night sweats, use one pig heart, open it with blood, add three qian each of ginseng and angelica, cook and eat. (2) For acute heart pain, put one peppercorn in the pig heart, cook with salt and wine, and eat. (3) For stagnation of heart qi, use one sheep heart, soak safflower in a cup of water, add a little salt, slowly apply it to the heart, roast it until cooked, and eat it to calm the heart.

### How to Make Menstruation More Profuse

— Zou Demin

Should Cold Foods Be Avoided Before and After Menstruation?

A woman's menstruation occurs once a month, like the waxing and waning of the moon, and like the regularity of the tides, without losing its proper state, hence the name "menstruation." Each menstruation lasts approximately five days, and lasts approximately ten days before and after each menstruation. According to the movement of the moon, it is half month of stillness and half month of movement. The key to magnifying the problem of movement and stillness in menstruation lies in regulating and preventing disease. This requires paying attention to nutrition in the diet, because diet is the source of blood and is closely related.

According to the record, Tianjin red dates and longan meat are rich in nourishment and can tonify the spleen and benefit the liver, nourish blood, and grow muscle. They can be steamed on the rice cooker and eaten as snacks when half hungry. Then, chew a few honey kumquats to make the taste sweet and fragrant and the chest and diaphragm relaxed. Eating them regularly and continuously will surely thicken the spleen and stomach qi and enrich the blood, making them the best nourishment for women's menstruation. In addition, cuttlefish and black sea cucumber are also very effective. According to the records in materia medica, these two substances nourish the liver and kidneys, tonify the blood vessels, regulate the extraordinary meridians, cure metrorrhagia, benefit pregnancy and childbirth, and regulate menstruation and vaginal discharge. They are often used as supplements and are sure to be effective. These two methods combine nutrition with diet and are delicious, convenient, and easy to obtain. So why not follow them? Furthermore, during menstruation, be careful not to eat too much of anything with anesthetic or stimulating properties.

Furthermore, most women like to eat sour foods. I have seen some who suddenly fainted after drinking vinegar soup, and others whose menstruation stopped and formed lumps after eating plums. Secondly, they like to eat raw and cold foods, but they do not know that raw and cold foods can easily cause blood vessels to become stagnant and blocked. Therefore, even in summer, sour and cold foods should be avoided during menstruation. If you are not careful, severe illness may occur suddenly, or mild blood vessel damage may occur, leading to irregular menstruation, or even amenorrhea and persistent white vaginal discharge. It will be too late for regrets.

### Beef and Dried Mussel Soup

— Yu Xiangyun

Beef contains a large amount of protein and fat, and everyone knows it has great nutritional benefits. But if beef and dried mussels are cooked together, the tonic effect is even greater. This is because dried mussels are an important medicine for nourishing Yin and replenishing blood. They can treat deficiency of essence and blood, spitting blood, chronic dysentery, cold pain in the abdomen, postpartum emaciation, metrorrhagia and leukorrhea, and also nourish the five internal organs and eliminate accumulated food. For those who are weak and deficient in blood, use a dozen dried mussels and a small piece of beef every day and simmer over a low heat (be sure not to use high heat, as it is easy for the water to dry out and not produce juice). After the water boils, filter off the foam, add a little salt and wine, then cover and simmer for several hours before eating. It can be served as a side dish or snack, and the taste is extremely delicious. If you take it every day without interruption, you will definitely see great results after a year. However, when buying beef, pay attention to choosing the freshest beef.

### Discussion on Diet

— Qin Bowei

5. Reed Rhizome and Imperata Rhizome: Reed rhizome is sweet and cold, containing sugar, colloid, protein, and neutral salts. Boil without the nodes for drinking to clear stomach fire, relieve restlessness and thirst, and treat internal heat. It is very effective. "Dutch Materia Medica" highly praises its cooling and blood-purifying, and remote water-promoting effects. This substance can also harmonize harsh and severe fluids and dilute viscous fluids, making it a good medicine for dissolving coagulations. Imperata rhizome has properties similar to reed rhizome and can also clear lung heat and intestinal heat, so it is often used together.

6. Coix Seed: Coix seed is commonly recognized as a wonderful product for managing dampness. However, it is not widely known that raw coix seed can dispel damp heat, while stir-fried coix seed can stop diarrhea and dysentery. Moreover, it contains more fat and protein than white rice, making it very nutritious. This differs from the aromatic damp-transforming and Qi-moving properties of cardamom, tangerine peel, and Buddha's hand. While those herbs may have a drying effect, coix seed has a neutral nature, although its effects are not immediately apparent.

7. Agastache and Eupatorium: For summer drinks, fresh agastache is the best. It is spicy and fragrant without being too strong, warm without being too dry, green and pleasing, harmonious and pleasant. It can dispel Yin and dampness while supporting the spleen and stomach's Qi. For those who are fatigued due to dampness, have chest tightness, headache, poor appetite, and a thick, turbid tongue coating, drinking this can quickly relieve symptoms. Eupatorium is also fragrant and suitable for dispersing, clearing away turbidity, and dispelling seasonal epidemics. They are comparable in excellence. In my humble opinion, this should be used in place of tea leaves when providing tea in hot weather. It is inexpensive, beautiful, and can reduce the occurrence of seasonal illnesses.

### Prevalence of "Sha Zi" in Children - Special Attention Should Be Paid to Diet (Part 1)

— You Xuezou

The onset of "sha zi" (measles), from infection to the body's recovery, has a specific sequence. The process is mild, stable, and without tension or danger, which is considered a normal case of "sha zi." Normal "sha zi" may not require medication. Once the disease mechanism changes, it can gradually progress smoothly and restore the original health. Randomly administering medication is not only useless but can also be harmful. However, while medication may not be necessary, special attention must be paid to dietary care.

The onset of "sha zi" is often due to negligence and lack of protection. Its complications are also often due to negligence and improper care. Even if the symptoms of a normal case of "sha zi" are mild and stable, one must not ignore them. Improper daily routines, exposure to wind and cold, and imbalanced diets can allow the "sha" pathogen to take advantage and cause complications.

Many people know that wind blockage can hinder the eruption of "sha zi," but they seem to pay less attention to diet. Although there is a saying that "sha zi" should be starved, most people do not know how to follow it. Caretakers of sick children indiscriminately feed them, as if satisfying their appetite is their most important responsibility. However, they do not realize that the transformation of normal "sha zi" into a dangerous condition originates from this.

When "sha zi" first starts, in addition to coughing, sneezing, and watery eyes, there are often symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and loose stools. This indicates that the gastric and intestinal mucosa are inflamed due to the influence of the "sha" toxin. If these symptoms are not severe, the eruption of "sha zi" will not be a problem. However, one point to note is that since the stomach and intestines are already inflamed, their digestive capacity will inevitably be reduced. Indiscriminately feeding or overeating will make digestion difficult, leading to significant gastrointestinal problems. At the same time, the eruption of "sha zi" will be hindered, and the disease will worsen. This is the reason for the saying that "sha zi" should be starved! Therefore, diet should be restricted at this time. If the child's appetite does not decrease, it is not necessary to completely stop feeding, but overeating should be avoided. If the child is a breastfed infant and the mother's milk is abundant, some milk should be expressed. If the infant's stool contains a large amount of white curd-like material, the mother should eat less greasy food.

When children develop "sha zi," their diet should first consider the ease of digestion and the richness of nutrients to determine what to include or exclude. The distinction between meat and vegetables is not important; however, greasy foods are the most difficult to digest and must be avoided, as they easily cause diarrhea. In terms of meat, choose lean meat and avoid fatty meat. Remove the oil from all meat soups. Even in terms of vegetarian foods, such as soybean oil, vegetable oil, and sesame oil, the same restrictions should be applied. Do not think that they are vegetarian and do not need to be restricted.

Traditionally, for "sha zi" and smallpox, when the rash first appears, people use the tips of shiitake mushrooms to make a decoction to promote eruption. In fact, normal "sha zi" will gradually erupt completely within a certain number of days without the need for eruptive substances. However, taking them does no great harm. If "sha zi" is difficult to erupt or erupts and then disappears, there are various underlying causes. These causes should be investigated and eliminated, as shiitake mushroom tip decoction cannot help.

At the onset of "sha zi," cold drinks and cold food are most taboo. Therefore, all food and drink must be kept at a suitable temperature. Cold tea and fruits should be strictly prohibited. If the patient is older and can take food on their own, snacks, cakes, and fruits should not be placed in the sickroom to prevent them from eating them indiscriminately. The fever is highest during the initial stage and rash stage of "sha zi." Patients will be very thirsty when they have a fever. They desire to drink something cool. However, cold drinks are most taboo for "sha zi." Therefore, the proper approach is to give them hot tea or hot soup. The quantity does not need to be restricted, as it can quench their thirst, slightly reduce the fever by promoting mild sweating, and increase urine output to wash away toxins in the body. Customarily, water chestnuts, cherry pits, or cotton thread are used to make a decoction, which is said to help the eruption of "sha zi." The value of this is debatable, but using it as a beverage is not harmful.

### A Brief Discussion on Literary Correspondence

— Bai Ying

There has been much discussion in various newspapers about literary correspondence. The proposal of this idea is very commendable, because literary correspondence is not only suitable for the current situation of resistance against Japan, but also has its place in the future when there is peace. Literary correspondence can be said to be a branch of reportage literature. However, because reportage literature originates from the author's side, it is somewhat subjective—at least in the eyes of the general reader. Literary correspondence can be said to be a two-sided reportage. The writers on both sides—regardless of whether they know each other personally—can provide readers with reports of what is happening in their respective locations in an organically linked manner. Even if the writers each write about their subjective views, even involving some personal trivial matters, as long as these trivial matters do not completely depart from the larger reality, then readers can deduce the objective truth of the entire event from the large and small events narrated by the correspondents on both sides.

Although the idea of domestic literary correspondence has only recently been raised, literary correspondence has been practiced internationally since the birth of Esperanto by Zamenhof. Whether between individuals or groups, the country most enthusiastic about promoting international literary correspondence through Esperanto should be the Soviet Union. In the past, there was an Esperanto newspaper in Shanghai called La Mondo, which introduced things like international literary correspondence. Many Soviet Esperanto youth groups often corresponded with similar groups in various countries and published good materials on wall newspapers or other publications. Individuals who were learning Esperanto also commonly corresponded with each other. Although this correspondence was not necessarily strictly literary, academic discussions, reports of local conditions, and the exchange of personal ideas were still a broad form of literary correspondence. Although I personally do not know the development of this aspect now, I deeply feel that this method is very commendable. If domestic literary correspondence movement is promoted in the language of one country, the result will certainly be easier to universally develop than international communication in Esperanto.

I personally believe that although the development of the literary correspondence movement initially requires the encouragement and promotion of newspapers and magazines to publish more of this kind of excellent material, for those who are engaged in literary correspondence, their main goal is still to exchange knowledge and ideas, rather than to publish their correspondence. To seek personal association through the exchange of common interests is objectively equivalent to the automatic organization of the masses, which is undoubtedly a great help in China during the current war of resistance against Japan.

Regarding the form of literary correspondence, if the purpose is to publish, then of course it will still take a similar form to reportage literature. However, if personal or group-style correspondence is adopted, and some trivial (but not necessarily purely personal) narratives are included, then this will definitely make the readers on the other side feel a layer of intimacy, and it will also be more interesting to third-party readers.

### Prisoner—Friend

— Diao Gong

I am happy! In the mountains of Yu, breathing in the fragrance of grass and trees. The songs of the masses, passionate, tragic, touch people's hearts all day long. I want to cry... gazing at the green hills of my homeland... shame on you!... this is cowardice!... listening to the generous songs, I laugh again... laugh until I yawn, laugh until I am moved...

Thinking again, what am I doing staying here? I might as well go see Qinghe. Qinghe, he is a prisoner. In the past, he was our enemy, but now he is our friend.

A thin body, short stature, dark face, short and stout. His face is often gnawed at by homesickness, without a trace of joy...

He not only surrendered to us, but he also became a good helper to us. Here, we have a special training class, and he is the class leader, with a monthly salary of five yuan, which is more than the deputy army commander. All the prisoners are incorporated into this class for training. Our friend trains very well. There is no separation between him and the group of people. He can use heartfelt speeches to touch his friends. His sincerity and repentance have influenced a large group of people. The education of killing has withered from the roots, in the sense of justice, in the passionate valley...

Walking down the mountain, a wide square, the sunlight ironing the black wooden house, warm and pleasant.

From afar, I heard Qinghe's voice, every word powerful, calm and painful. Although I cannot understand the form of the language, but the friends' righteous hearts, strung together in a mutual chain, I am moved and excited!

Rows of benches, scattered with dozens of trainees, they were captured, the shortest two months or more, the longest also four or five months. Although they miss their hometowns, there is some desolation, but great justice stimulates their conscience, work has honed their interest, and the sincerity of mankind has dispelled unnecessary suspicion... I know they have deep repentance and sincere submission.

At the office door, I met Lin Jun, and I went in and sat for a while. Several white wooden tables, with several letters spread on the table, in ×× characters. Pulling out the letter paper, it is still strange to me. I wonder: what is this letter? Lin Jun knew that I was confused, and smiled to test me: "Do you know what this is?"

I couldn't answer, and quickly asked him to explain.

"This is what Qinghe wrote to us!" he said, "You are new here, so you naturally don't know. He has written us so many, many letters. He has to write more than a dozen letters every day and send them to their army."

"What's the content? You understand × language, read one to me, okay?"

He agreed, took out a letter, and translated it orally for me:

(It is a letter that is not very long but has the magic of agitation)

"I only realize now that we were all running dogs in the past, and our white bones were sawn into medals for the generals.

"We are suffering, for whom? For self-defense? We started the war! We have no justice, only slaughter!

"I have realized! I don't want to be a running dog!

(All who abide by justice are our friends! We have no enemies! Those who persecute us, causing us to live and die separately, are our enemies!

"Why be anesthetized by the education of killing, killing friends, and also killing yourself? I am not a coward! But I am not willing to make unnecessary sacrifices. I have closely joined hands with justice.

"I am very well here. The repentance of the past gives me the joy of new life. Killing prisoners is a deceptive rumor. Basically, I am still alive and very comfortable. Fellow sufferers! I am waiting for you to come too, to join hands with justice.

"Remember! We have no enemies! The Chinese are willing to be friends with us.

"I am writing this letter out of sincerity and not under duress."

After reading, Lin Jun's face flashed with the light of victory, and my heart revealed warmth. The raging flames! A foreign friend lit a torch from his heart, and my heart was also illuminated with a red light.

Not a prisoner anymore! He is our friend!

### Can This Work Succeed?

### "Not Eligible"

— Mingfu

In the past, scholars who failed the annual examination and were rated as "not eligible" had to carry a red-lacquered manure bucket back to the countryside to farm. It is said that the true master of humor, Jin Shengtan, carried a red-lacquered manure bucket several times because he regarded taking the scholar examination as a child's play, sometimes taking it and sometimes dropping it, and then changing his name to take it and drop it again. When he was rated as "not eligible," he was not only not annoyed but also very proud. He often carried a red-lacquered manure bucket and swaggered out of the city gate, saying with a smile to people, "This time I was lucky again to be listed as 'not eligible,' back to my hometown to farm."

However, "not eligible" means that they are extremely bad and cannot be cultivated. After all, it is a bad name. Except for Jin Shengtan, who had other ideas and was happy to play with it, people generally feared getting it on themselves and avoided it. Later, when the emperor fell and the imperial examination was abolished, the "pomp" of "not eligible" was no longer heard. The three words "not eligible" were almost forgotten.

Recently, things on the isolated island have been "re-cycled," and I don't know how, "not eligible" has arisen again. The old and young remnants who have not died may want to see Mr. Jin, who carried a red-lacquered manure bucket back to the countryside to farm. However, the trick is still a trick, and a "new" one has been turned out from the "old" one. Today's "not eligible" is very different from the past.

Those who are honored with the title of "not eligible" are not expelled from the city gate but invited into the office. They do not have red-lacquered manure buckets on their shoulders, but they hold 262.50 yuan of legal currency in their hands every month. They do not go back to farming but come to do business, doing business without capital...

However, no matter how new or old they are recycled, these new "not eligible" have one thing in common with Jin Shengtan, that is, when they come out of the door, they are happy and tell people, "I was lucky enough to be listed as 'not eligible,' back home to enjoy life." They also regard a bad name as a good name; however, they still have their "other ideas," unlike Jin Shengtan, who was just playing.

Originally, they always regarded a bad name as a good name, and vice versa, they also regarded a good name as a bad name; they always had a habit of liking scabs, and their views on beauty and ugliness were reversed with people.

They regarded "robbers" as "heroes," "killing, arson, rape, and plunder" as "practicing friendship," "aggressive militarism" as "maintaining peace," and "hegemony" as "openness"... Therefore, taking "not eligible" as an honor may be regarded as "super-eligible" or "special-eligible." Guessing their thoughts, they take more money than "eligible," so why is "not eligible" not "super-eligible" or "special-eligible"?

That's right, extrapolating from this, a country that can invade other countries and plunder a lot of money has also become a "not eligible country," and a "not eligible country" can naturally be interpreted as a "super-eligible country" or a "special-eligible country." "Germany above all else" is also this starting point.

The reality matches the name, and the name is justified. The person is a "not eligible person," and the country is a "not eligible country," enough to "make a great name in the universe." We should praise them.

I think my article "Not Eligible" is not ashamed to be listed as "not eligible," so I should also carry a red-lacquered manure bucket. I am very willing to do this, because I have already praised these "not eligible" people, and I can no longer ask for anything else. I can follow Mr. Jin back to the countryside to farm.

### Old Ferry

— Shaoguang

The silent earth, towering with steep, ferocious peaks.

The burly old trees, wandering on the shore of a deep and wide river.

In the spring of the past, there were: —

Intoxicating fragrance of flowers,

Sweet singing of birds;

Strong boatmen, humming brisk fishing songs in the shimmering waves;

Young village girls, singing affectionate ditties in the woods;

Nimble "sampans," one after another,

Like agile green fish,

Gliding across the clear water surface,

Passengers crossing the river, who did not reveal admiring, smiling expressions?

Yes, in the spring of the past,

This ancient ferry was filled with:

Tranquil, pleasant, charming, and secluded atmosphere.

But, since the enemy moved their knives and guns,

This peaceful ancient ferry,

Has also changed its appearance:—

Old trees, embedded with bullet marks;

Peaks, scarred all over from being bombed;

Fishing songs, ditties, disappeared without a trace,

The shouts of charging and killing the enemy,

Touched the heavens and ghosts;

Bloodstained the fragrance of flowers,

Gunshots drove away the chirping of birds.

Who would have thought that this ancient ferry,

Now became the battleground of the War of Resistance.

Peace-loving villagers,

Unexpectedly trained into vanguards for killing the enemy!

"Who pities the loss of this mere landscape?

A new paradise grows in the sacred battle!"

Ah, the children of the ancient ferry are all awakened,

They unanimously expressed their great sincerity!

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

The rescue team led by Fang Hui, the younger sister of Regiment Commander Ye, worked very hard to rescue wounded soldiers and civilians in this street battle. When the entire army retreated north due to the fierce artillery fire of the × army, the rescue team also retreated with the army. However, due to inconvenient transportation in the countryside and lack of suitable transportation tools, the stretcher bearers carried the wounded warriors, and no matter how hard they walked, they could not walk quickly. Therefore, they only reached Zhao Family Village, nine miles north of Hepu Town, by night and were isolated from the main army.

The people in this village had all fled upon hearing the news, leaving only some old, weak, women, and children. The rescue team, unable to distinguish the road due to the darkness and in urgent need of treating the wounded, found a farmhouse thatched hut in the village to stay in for rest.

There were a total of eleven people in their team. Besides Fang Hui, there was also the original chief of the military medical office, four stretcher bearers who also served as nurses, and five wounded warriors, three of whom had minor injuries and could move on their own after bandaging, and two of whom had serious injuries and were lying on stretchers, moaning incessantly. The farmhouse thatched hut where the rescue team was staying had three rooms. The left and right rooms were used as wards, and the middle room was used as an office.

Although there were not many villagers left in the village, there were still some. Just as they had settled down, several old women came to the door to peek, and everyone was surprised to see that Fang Hui was a woman. Fang Hui took this opportunity to explain their origins in detail to them and asked them to provide as much assistance as possible within their means. These old women also knew the reputation of Ye Guozhang. When they heard that Fang Hui was the younger sister of Regiment Commander Ye and that her heroic actions were rare among women, they could not help but admire and sympathize. Therefore, some sent lights, some sent bedding, and some sent food. Before long, everything was ready.

Fang Hui thanked everyone and enjoyed the items they had sent. She was always a meticulous person, and in this tense environment, she did not dare to be careless in the slightest. Therefore, before going to bed, she especially instructed everyone: (35)

### Lesson of Blood

— Liufeng

— Mourning the Two Brave Warriors Qu Du and Wang Jin —

Dying not in the hail of bullets from the enemy, but under the knives of their own people, this is what I feel heartbroken for Qu Du and Wang Jin, the two brave leaders who were active in the guerrilla area of northern Jiangsu, leading guerrilla warfare, and at the same time, I feel indignant for them.

According to this newspaper's local news column (14th) the other day:

"Since Tong, Hai, Chong, and Qi successively fell between March and April last year, the people have suffered greatly. Battalion Commander Qu Du immediately started an uprising in his hometown of Chongming, destroying his family to raise an army, and began to organize guerrilla forces. In the Battle of Shituo Port, he inflicted the first blow on the enemy. Martyr Wang Jin was originally a student at ×× University in Shanghai. In the autumn of last year, he joined Martyr Qu's troops, engaged in organizing the masses and developing guerrilla work. He fought with the Japanese army five times, capturing many and building remarkable achievements, sweeping away the public's fear of the Japanese and recovering the county seat of Qidong. The army and the people got along well, and the people of northern Jiangsu praised him. As a result, the two-faced elements in the area became jealous, resulting in the Incident on January 10, which killed our national heroes, which the world cannot help but regret.

In this way, the death of the two brave warriors, Qu Du and Wang Jin, was because they worked "too" hard on the work of national salvation, and thus suffered the jealousy of the two-faced elements in the area and were murdered.

We must not ignore this tragic "bloody case." On the one hand, we must feel indignant for the two brave warriors, Qu Du and Wang Jin, and on the other hand, we must arouse the attention of the warriors in the entire guerrilla area of southern Jiangsu to this criminal "bloody case."

As the War of Resistance has entered a new stage, our wise Chairman Chiang has already shown everyone that the second phase of the War of Resistance focuses on guerrilla tactics. If that is the case, then the tasks of the guerrilla warriors in the guerrilla areas are so important!

However, we will never hide the fact that there are many wise and decisive guerrilla warriors in the guerrilla areas of southern Jiangsu who are fighting with the enemy, but there are also many who are taking the name of guerrillas and doing things that are selfish and self-serving in entrenched areas. This is not only the misfortune of the guerrilla team in southern Jiangsu itself, but also a stumbling block in the War of Resistance of the Chinese nation. However, due to the sacrifice of the two brave warriors, Qu and Wang, the warriors in our entire guerrilla area of southern Jiangsu should be thoroughly awakened. All those who resist the enemy are their own brothers, and they should unite and advance towards the same goal! We should not be "jealous," we should "compete." "Jealousy" only weakens our own strength, giving the enemy the opportunity to defeat us one by one! Only "competition" is our proper action! Therefore, here, we hope that the warriors in the entire guerrilla area of southern Jiangsu will draw a valuable lesson from the bloodshed of the two warriors, Qu and Wang, that is, to immediately unite closely and participate in the "competition" movement of resisting the enemy!

(Enter Sheng) "Guarding Fengzhou, the army's array boasts a million spears and halberds." (Speaks) "I am Feng Zhongyi. In the fourth year of Shaoxing, I was the commander of Jianzhou. Time flies, and it has been eight years. I have been promoted several times, holding the position of Supreme Commander, leading troops to guard Fengzhou. Today, I am free and have nothing to do, so I might as well take a walk in front of the hall." (Enter Servant) "He Chengxin, the envoy from Guangzhou, requests an audience." (Sheng) "Summon him!" (Servant) "Please come in." (Xiaosheng, from within) "Here I come!" (Enters hastily) "Leaving Guangzhou, I have arrived at Fengzhou City. He Chengxin, the envoy from Guangzhou, pays his respects to the lord and presents an official document." (Presents the document; Sheng receives it, looks at it in the dim light, and appears surprised and doubtful) (Sheng) "Very well. You have traveled a long distance, enduring much wind and frost. Please rest at the post station for now. Come!" (Servant) "Yes, sir." (Sheng) "Lead Envoy He to the post station for a rest." (Servant) "Yes, sir."

If others hear this, wouldn't it be a joke?" (Dan) "I have looked at him carefully several times. There can be no one else in the world who looks so similar. Back then, Marshal Han Yuan killed all those named Fan in Jianzhou without pardon. It is possible that my husband changed his name." (Sheng) "That may be so. What do you suggest?" (Dan) "In your child's opinion, why doesn't Father offer him wine and food and ask him directly? Young Master Fan's nickname is Sai Yuanhou [Surpasses the Monkey].

(Exits and re-enters with Xiaosheng) (Xiaosheng) "The lord has summoned me. What military matter do you wish to discuss?" (Sheng) "I feared that the envoy would not come, so I made a joke. There is nothing else. I was only afraid that the envoy would be lonely on his journey, so I have prepared wine and would like to have a drink with you!" (Xiaosheng) "I dare not!"

### The Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel

Produced by London Film Company, Showing at Cathay Theatre

Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon received excellent reviews for their starring roles in "The Scarlet Pimpernel." Now, the British London Film Company, under the production of Alexander Korda, is continuing to film "The Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel," which is certainly not a meaningless endeavor.

We are well aware that the famous French Revolution in French history represents the most brilliant sparks ignited by the French people in their struggle for national freedom and liberation. Moreover, in the course of this revolution, we can clearly point out that those who betray the people will inevitably fall ruthlessly. Even if you are temporarily powerful, you will eventually meet your final fate.

The work on "The Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel" is not in vain because it weaves through a love story and points out two things: (1) In 1794, the French monarchy had just been overthrown, and a legitimate democratic government had not yet been established, leading to nationwide turmoil. Robespierre, under the guise of a democratic government, engaged in indiscriminate killings and eliminated dissidents. Because Robespierre's regime was not based on the people, its foundation was very fragile. Later, when true revolutionary leaders emerged, the overthrow of Robespierre's regime was inevitable. (2) When the people united to strike at Robespierre's government forces, morale wavered for a moment, and Robespierre's government immediately collapsed. This reveals a truth: the power of the masses is the most precious. The current legitimate democratic government in France was forged with the blood of the people.

However, in terms of writing methods and screenplay composition, the playwright also reveals two weaknesses:

First, it focuses on the Scarlet Pimpernel and his wife, so that the people's antipathy and anger towards the current government are hardly touched upon. Although there are secret meetings of the Scarlet Pimpernel's members, using this to replace the anger of the French people is not enough.

Second, because the play touches so little on the people's antipathy towards the government, the subsequent rebellion in parliament and the unfolding revolution lack a sense of reality.

These two points can be said to be the biggest shortcomings of the film.

But apart from these, "The Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel" has achieved excellent results in terms of both drama and performance.

Here, the script reveals several advantages: (1) Although the actress Shirley Shelsia was ordered to go to England to bind the Scarlet Pimpernel's wife and bring her to France, she secretly sympathized with the Scarlet Pimpernel's character. Therefore, her husband's harsh criticism of Robespierre in parliament is very natural and sincere. (2) The playwright is able to use extremely dramatic means to have the Scarlet Pimpernel rescue his wife from danger on three occasions, even to the point where the Scarlet Pimpernel's own life is in great danger in the last two instances, but he always manages to turn danger into safety. (3) The character of the Scarlet Pimpernel is portrayed in an extremely dramatic way, and his three disguises to save his wife are very endearing.

Based on the script's rich dramatic nature, the ups and downs of emotions and the unfolding of the atmosphere make the whole play full of excitement and tension. Although the director is unfamiliar, his handling is unusually vigorous. For example: (1) When the sinister Minister of Security Chauvelin is dining with the actress, the Scarlet Pimpernel appears as a deaf and mute old general, and leaves a note scolding Chauvelin before leaving, and incidentally hands the bill to Chauvelin. (2) When the Scarlet Pimpernel and his wife are first surrounded, the whole room is filled with guards. The director first has the Scarlet Pimpernel's wife go out, and then has the Scarlet Pimpernel extinguish the lights and break through the encirclement. This scene is very exciting and tense. (3) This is the most tense climax of the whole play. When the Scarlet Pimpernel rescues his wife from prison with a fake order, they are surrounded by Chauvelin's guards again. At this time, the emotions have reached their climax, but the director's handling is excellent. The masses at the meeting rush to the prison gate, causing the government to collapse immediately, Chauvelin is beaten by the people, and this climax is ended in a very clever way.

Barry Barnes, who plays the Scarlet Pimpernel, has very expressive eyes and voice, and grasps the character of the revolutionary leader very tightly. To be honest, he is no worse than Leslie Howard.

### After the Rain

Chapter Six: Praising a Prodigy, One Seed, Three Blossoms; Narrating Friendship, Two Scholars Meet Heroes

The highway that Zhu Airen and others are now traveling on is very busy with traffic. Public buses come and go constantly, and private cars also speed along this highway. Half of the highway runs along the river, and both sides of the road are planted with trees. Some places are planted with willows, while others are planted with parasol trees. Looking through the shade of the trees, one often sees clear mountains and beautiful waters, with excellent scenery. Sometimes, in the shadows of the setting sun, one sees two or three small boats leisurely drifting about, as if they are unconcerned with everything in the world. At certain distances, there are electric light poles between the trees. Even on the larger iron bridges, artistic electric lights are installed on the bridge railings. When these electric lights are lit, they can illuminate the water surface for a long distance. At this time, He Shuangyu could not help but ask, "Can this highway be used at night?" Zhu Airen said, "In the past, these highways were not open at night, so there were no electric lights along the way. Now that transportation is more convenient and human affairs are more complex, it is necessary to travel at night. Since electric lights have also reached the villages, it is also very convenient. In the past, public buses stopped running at 7 pm, but now they run until 12 pm. As for private cars, they can run all night, because the electric lights are on all night. Before the war, we were concerned about insecurity on the road and bandits blocking the way, but now there is no need to worry. If such things really happen, they will be solved in less than half a day." He Liyu said, "I haven't seen a single policeman along the way. Do these roads not need policemen?" Zhu Airen said, "There are policemen, but very few. Policemen are like soldiers, quality is more important than quantity. Not to mention these empty highways, even in the bustling areas of the city, there are not many policemen. It is probably because the people's ability to self-govern is gradually increasing, so there is no need for so many policemen. That is a certain principle. Moreover, the standards of the police are also high. Only those who have been trained in police schools can become policemen. The most ridiculous thing is that the police in Suzhou in the past were extremely corrupt, and some of them could not even read. There were not a few policemen! When I was a child, I followed my grandfather to the city. I saw a policeman every few feet, with a cigarette in his mouth and his hands in his sleeves. Sometimes he stood in front of a small cigarette paper shop, talking and laughing. If there was any dispute on the road, he would deliberately turn his head away and pretend not to see it. These policemen were all good-for-nothings. What was the use of having so many good-for-nothing policemen? Moreover, they bullied the poor, extorted money, and colluded with local gangsters and bandits. The policemen were even better at it." (62)

### Rambling on Catching and Releasing

— Faisheng

Speaking of the play "Catching and Releasing Cao," everyone knows that it is an important show for sheng actors. Most sheng actors can sing this play, but the plot and lyrics of this play need to be greatly revised. Let me elaborate on this below for the review of fellow enthusiasts.

First, this play must not be cut off from the court and only start from the road scene. Because, as the name suggests, without the "catching Cao" in the court, how can it be called "catching and releasing Cao"? Some people say: This is too拘. Look at "Nine Watch" isn't it over after finishing the rolling nails? Can't catching and releasing be just releasing without catching? That's true, but the reason why "Nine Watch" only plays to the end of rolling nails is because there is nothing exciting to play down there! The court here, however, is important for both sheng and jing, with many lyrics worth savoring. It can't be generalized. Besides, it's not appropriate for "Nine Watch" not to play to the ninth watch.

Second, it is a big loophole for Lü Boshe to go out to buy wine himself. Think about it, he meets distinguished guests of the court, long-separated friends, outside the village, and hurries to invite them home. How courteous that is. In theory, he should accompany them to talk about their longings and comfort them. How can he leave these distinguished guests coldly aside and let them sit there coldly and quietly, while he himself goes to do the unimportant thing of buying wine? Besides, when he brought Cao and Chen into the village, there were family members greeting him. Why not have this family member go to buy wine? Even if this family member is the one who slaughters pigs, but when Pu Cao enters the house with a sword, there are as many as four people killed in the play. Can't these four people do the small task of buying wine? Undoubtedly, Lü Boshe's personal wine purchase is a major flaw in the whole play.

Third, the lyrics in Chen Gong's long Xipi slow board are all inner words, which are called back supply in the industry. Cao Cao certainly heard nothing. I am afraid that Chen Gong would not escape being Lü Boshe's second self. After Cao Cao's back supply, he then said: "Chen Gongtai, are your words deceitful?" With this question, the listeners are confused. This is also one of the major flaws of this play.

In summary, if the above three points can be slightly revised, the whole play can be made more colorful. Let me write it out first. The inappropriate places in the lyrics are attached to the last paragraph.

According to the first point mentioned above, there is no need to change it. Just start from the court. According to the second point, the method of modification is as long as Cao Cao asks Lü Boshe: "Uncle, where are you going with the gourd in your hand?" The sentence is answered with: "There are vegetables in the house, but there is a lack of fine wine. I should have sent a family member to buy wine, but I am afraid of leaking the news of the two gentlemen, which is not very stable. Therefore, the old man personally goes to buy fine wine, and he will also respect the two gentlemen with three cups." (According to Zhou Xiaotian's performance on the last night of the Golden Stage last year, the person who played Lü Boshe was Wang Rongsen, who had the above lyrics. The next day, Yu once commented on it in the "Drama World.") Such a change seems to be more stable. Again, regarding the third point, Cao Cao should not use the old words after Chen Gong sings: "...must persuade him." I want to change Cao Cao's question to "Chen Gongtai, why do you look sad, is there any fraud in your heart?" Then Chen Gong's "Minggong ah" immediately sings: "It's not that I have a sad face and fraud in my heart, you are a righteous person who made a mistake, the old man Lü and your father have a false friendship, why are you suspicious of killing his whole family, if his family is killed by you, then it should be the end, but you came out of the village and split the old man with a sword, isn't that a cruel death?" My humble opinion is like this, please ask the domestic enthusiasts to correct me. There are also inappropriate words, please correct them. For example: "Stop crying and avoid sadness, hang the words of loyalty and filial piety in your heart, work together to destroy the traitorous party, and the beautiful name will be promoted in Lingyan Pavilion." This Lingyan Pavilion was built by Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty as a pavilion for drawing meritorious officials. Chen Gong is a person of the Later Han Dynasty and cannot use it. Therefore, I want to change it to "Qilin Pavilion". There is a sentence in the rocking board, "Good words can't wake up a stupid cow and a wooden horse, compare this thief to a frog at the bottom of the well", I intend to change it to "Good words can't move him, at this time I have to endure it for a while." There is a large section of Erhuang in the back hotel, "the old man's life is stained with yellow sand..." Can life be stained? I want to change it to "blood-stained yellow sand". The rest is really too much to change, but if you can modify a few points according to the above, it can be roughly passed; otherwise, if you nitpick, there is no play to sing. There is no shortage of experts in the country, and I would not hesitate to teach and correct them. The drama is fortunate, and the national drama is fortunate.

A certain lady (temporarily concealing her name), who is excellent in both color and art, is good at socializing, and is good at singing and dancing, will devote herself to the silver screen and should be able to stand out and become a rising star.

Li Jirui Enjoyed a Temporary Fame with Seven and a Half Plays

It is true that there are a few particularly lively group plays, or famous plays in which a certain role excels, that can be sung two or three times over. However, for a leading actor like Li Jirui, if he only had seven and a half plays, it would be really annoying to sing them over and over again during this long period of forty to fifty days. One year, at the Daxin Stage (now the Tianchan Stage on Fourth Avenue), he sang "Fishing and Killing Home" and did not sing well, so he was booed off the stage by the audience, who clamored for refunds. From then on, he realized that Shanghai's operas were not easy to sing, and his seven and a half plays were really not enough. Therefore, he never went to Shanghai to perform again. (The Ducitang event is not included.) Fortunately, his later years were not bad. He owned many properties in Tianjin and also ran several businesses. From then on, he retired from the singing stage and lived well enough. According to his fellow Tianjin natives, this man was pure and filial. Every year, he would take his mother to Putuo to offer incense, and he would always report to his mother every day. He dared not disobey her orders. The plays he performed in his life all contained meanings such as "loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness." Therefore, both insiders and outsiders in Pingjin respected his character. Moreover, he sang very seriously and had a loud voice. Even if his martial arts skills were a little lacking and he knew fewer plays, he would be forgiven. In fact, when it comes to the true combination of literary and martial arts in the Huang school of martial arts students, (Huang Yueshan, known as Huang Pang, was as famous as Yu Jiusheng. Therefore, the martial arts student line has the Yu Huang two schools.) That is the old actor Ma Decheng, who is still performing in Pingjin. Ma can perform many plays and is excellent at them. Unfortunately, he never became popular in his life. The photo above was taken thirty years ago. Looking at his posture, we can get a glimpse of his true artistic skills.

### A Little Hope for the Comedian Circle

— Liang Yan

— Should Write More Lyrics with Blood and Energy

I dare say that the comedian circle before August 13th was in the darkest process. But after the sound of artillery fire, a small part of those engaged in comedy have written a lot of lyrics full of blood and energy and performed on stage, catering to the objective needs, and actually won the welcome of the broad audience under the stage. Then, everyone else followed suit, which is indeed a gratifying thing, and it is also the harvest of the comedian circle's own awareness.

Most of the lyrics such as "Saving Refugees", "Heaven and Earth Xuanhuang" and "Scolding the Second Landlord" which are popular in the current comedy circle are full of patriotic thoughts. What I appreciate most is "Saving Refugees" which Lu Xiaofeng and Yu Xiangming sang together. When singing "Refugees also have people from Pudong", they insert a dialogue between mother and child, which makes people sad when they hear it, as if this "Refugee Wandering Picture" is right in front of you. People with a heart will not go to save the refugees when they hear it.

We speculate that the reason why comedy was so corrupt in the past was that everyone copied old tunes and refused to write their own lyrics, and used "Catching Alive", "Mending the Tank" and other nonsensical dances to appeal to the audience. Now the audience is enlightened, and if they don't write lyrics with blood and energy, they will not be able to attract the audience. In fact, everyone can use these 30 minutes to transport some common sense to the audience: such as breaking superstitions, promoting domestic goods, and rescuing refugees. Moreover, you must not be afraid that the environment will stop us, because this is the day when the comedian circle exhales and raises eyebrows, and it is also the time to fulfill the responsibility for the country.

### Finance, Cash Prices Fluctuate Slightly

Yesterday, the situation in the cash "cooked red" gray market was similar to the previous day, showing an initial weakness followed by a strengthening. The initial opening was lowered to 2086 yuan due to a lack of buyers. Subsequently, due to foreign exchange being manipulated by Tianjin speculators and foreign firms, the situation was slightly soft, and a certain foreign bank was secretly absorbing a lot of purchases, coupled with local and Tianjin groups also following to buy, the market situation turned around and strengthened. The result was a slight rise of one yuan, and people's hearts were balanced. The transaction was relatively active. Gold jewelry also fell first and then rose, with no clear winner or loser. Customs gold, Sino-British pure gold, etc., increased their gains.

### "Cooked Red" Gray Market Rises One Yuan

Since the morning, the initial asking price for each bar (ten taels) was 2092-3 yuan, but most buyers were on the sidelines. Before long, a certain bank suddenly started selling, so the price broke into the 90-yuan range. First, a certain bank, on behalf of a money exchange, sold 50 taels to a certain money shop at 2080 yuan, which was 9 yuan lower than the previous closing. After the opening, a certain money shop immediately sold back to the money exchange at a price of 88 yuan. Subsequently, at the same price, a certain money exchange, on behalf of a local group, purchased 50 taels from a peer. Later, a securities group sold 50 taels to a money exchange, also at a price of 88 yuan. A gold shop purchased 50 taels from a money exchange for 87 yuan. After that, it was heard that foreign exchange was softening due to manipulation by Tianjin speculators and foreign firms, which prompted a certain foreign bank to instruct a certain bank to come and purchase. The price then turned upward. A certain bank purchased 50 taels each from a jewelry group and a cash shop, both at 90 yuan. Subsequently, it also purchased 50 taels from a jewelry group for 91 yuan. Later, a certain broker also purchased 50 taels from a gold shop on behalf of the Pingjin group, at the same price. Before long, the gold shop sold 50 taels to a securities group for 92 yuan. After that, the gold shop suddenly purchased 50 taels from a jewelry group for 93 yuan. Money exchanges did 50 taels among themselves at 94 yuan. The jewelry group then sold 50 taels to a money exchange, with 93 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, trading was quiet, and the price continued to rise. First, money exchanges did 50 taels among themselves at 94 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop also purchased 50 taels from a money exchange for 95 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange sold 50 taels to a securities group for 96 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange still had the intention to sell, but buyers were already watching. It was not until after 4 o'clock that any trading was seen, so the evening closing price was still 2096 yuan, resulting in a rise of one yuan compared to the previous day (a difference of 10 yuan for the whole day). The selling price of the cash shop's own-brand gold was 2105 yuan, and the purchase price was 2090 yuan. The current benchmark gold was挂牌金金挂牌金金挂牌金金50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and no trading took place.

### Jewelry Exchange Rate Falls and Recovers

The exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael did not change at first. It was not until 10:40 that, due to the slight weakness of the "cooked red" potential, it also dropped by a small yuan. Later, at 4:00 PM sharp, because the "cooked red" stopped falling and rose back, it also rose by one yuan. As a result, Da Tong Hang still hung at 213 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang was also still at 211 yuan, with a purchase price of 205 yuan.

### Pure Gold Rises Another Two and a Half Pence

London, 15th: Due to the weakness of the pound sterling, the price of British pure gold rose by another two and a half pence per ounce, reaching £7 8s 5 1/2d. As a result, the central bank's purchase price of Chinese cash also rose to 1211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold also rose by 4 li, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard benchmark gold price also rose by 1 yuan and 6 jiao, totaling 1207 yuan and 2 jiao.

### Tianjin Group Still Settling Foreign Exchange

Although Western Merchants Have Supply... The Result Is Still Slightly Tight

Yesterday's foreign exchange market was continuously manipulated by Tianjin speculators and major foreign firms. Fortunately, Western merchants Sassoon and foreign banks such as HSBC had a good supply intention, so the resulting tightness was not severe. However, the situation remained calm and stable in the middle, with very little fluctuation and sluggish trading. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, it continued to soften due to the strong purchasing power of foreign firms.

In the early morning, the London long-term bills and forwards remained unchanged, and the New York silver price also remained stable. London raw gold continued to rise by two and a half pence, the exchange rate of pound sterling against the US dollar was down by two and a half li, against the French franc down by six centimes, against Shanghai remained flat, the US dollar against the pound sterling was down by 25, against the French franc unchanged, against Shanghai was reduced by five fen. The central bank's listed prices remained unchanged as before. The bank's morning opening selling prices were: pound sterling exchange rate at 8 265625/1000000ths of a shilling, US dollar exchange rate at 16 yuan 15625/100000ths, compared with the previous close, there was no change in either the pound sterling or US dollar exchange rates. After the opening, Tianjin speculators and major foreign firms continued to manipulate the market, with HSBC, Sino-Belgian, Ewo, pound sterling at 8 25/100ths of a shilling, and US dollar at 16 yuan 125/1000ths, so the situation was slightly soft. HSBC's listed prices and the announcement of the silver balancing tax remained unchanged. After that, although Western merchant Sassoon supplied, foreign banks had a good appetite, so it was not affected. Sassoon offered a certain bank US dollars at 16 yuan 125/1000ths, and later a foreign firm purchased Hong Kong dollars from a Chinese bank at 55 yuan 25. As a result, the situation was also slightly tight. By the noon closing, the bank's selling prices were: pound sterling exchange rate at 8 25/100ths of a shilling, US dollar exchange rate at 16 yuan 125/1000ths.

The afternoon trading was still quite sparse, but Tianjin speculators and major foreign firms continued to manipulate the market. However, Western merchant Sassoon and the British bank HSBC continued to supply, so the situation lacked change. Tianjin speculators and foreign firms settled with Sassoon and HSBC, pound sterling at 8 25/100ths of a shilling, and US dollar at 16 yuan 125/1000ths. Later, a foreign firm also absorbed Hong Kong dollars from a foreign bank at 55 yuan 25. The situation was quite stable. By the evening closing, the bank's selling prices were: pound sterling exchange rate at 8 25/100ths of a shilling, US dollar exchange rate at 16 yuan 125/1000ths. As a result, the pound sterling tightened by 0.015625, the US dollar reduced by 0.03125, and the Hong Kong dollar was also more expensive by 0.125 compared to the previous closing.

### Foreign Currencies Are Strong

Yesterday, British pure gold rose sharply by one and a half pence. The British-American exchange rate continued to fall by 25. Foreign exchange in this port was very strong due to the settlement of accounts by foreign firms, the purchasing was relentless, the supply of foreign telegraphs was scarce, and the bank's willingness to sell was quite sluggish, trending towards weakness. The "cooked red" opened, and gold shops, money exchanges, etc., acted as agents for wealthy individuals to release large amounts, becoming weak for a time. Subsequently, retail investors took the opportunity to absorb at low prices, and market prices stabilized. In the morning, retail investors had slight supply and demand, with limited changes and scarce trading. The closing was slightly firm. Recently, due to the Tianjin and Hong Kong groups watching, there were no drastic changes. However, market prices occasionally fell, and the multi-party immediately maintained it at low prices, secretly preparing for a high rise. Foreign currencies initially softened due to the loosening of gold prices, British and American gold pounds, and wealthy individuals slightly sold, with very little demand. The market prices fell slightly. Other currencies, due to tight drafts, had slightly more demand in retail stores, and market prices rose slightly. Trading was not prosperous throughout the day, and the guild's trading did not open. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds down by 2 jiao, British gold drafts up by 3 fen, American gold pounds down by 1 jiao, American gold drafts up by 1 fen and 2 li, Hong Kong drafts up by 1 li, French franc drafts up by 5 hao, Dutch drafts up by 2 fen, Philippine drafts up by 2 fen, Australian gold drafts up by 3 jiao, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Indian Silver Is Walking Briskly

New York, 15th: Speculators bought and sold, with few transactions. The market was calm, and extremely stable after the close. The prices of long-term and forward large-bar silver remained unchanged. The New York silver telegraphic price remained stable as before. Also, the Bombay silver telegraph reported that the Indian silver market was firm and brisk, with spot prices continuing to rise by 3 annas, and long-term and forward prices also continuing to rise by 4 annas.

### Discount Rate Continues to Be Small

Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts and bills continued to fall slightly. It once fell to 49 yuan per thousand yuan, but by noon it had returned to 49 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. In the afternoon, the final rate was 49 yuan and a half. As a result, it fell by 2 jiao and 5 fen compared to the previous day.

### Branch Notes of Silk Industry in Other Ports Can Be Exchanged at the Shanghai Head Office

The Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry yesterday sent letters to each bank, stating: "The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank Head Office has written, stating, 'Our branches in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Shengze have moved to Shanghai one after another due to war or for the convenience of transportation, and are handling receipts and payments at our head office.

### Securities, Retail Investors Take Profits, Public Bonds Suddenly Recover

Unified B Falls by 9 Jiao, The Largest; Foreign Debt, British and German Bonds Continue to Fall by Half a Pound

Yesterday's securities gray market surprisingly showed a slight recovery, but the momentum was still slow. The large multi-party households remained firmly in place, and sporadic retail investors frequently entered and exited, causing slight ripples in market prices. This is also a phenomenon that should occur after a rapid rise in prices. However, the British policy of maintaining legal tender in China has been passed by Parliament, and the policy of assisting China is not easy to change. The bond market has been supported by this, so even if there is a recovery, it is still easier to rise than to fall. Yesterday's fall was just a small recovery. Yesterday's process: At the morning opening, Tiansheng turned to selling, and the attention of the trading floor shifted, because it had raised prices at the closing the day before. Therefore, general sporadic retail investors rose to sell. Numbers 49, Tongkang, and Xieda all had sales. Numbers 4, 7, and 20 still had purchases. Defu and Lianhe had digestive capacity. Market prices were maintained, but had slightly decreased by 4 or 5 jiao. In the afternoon, Number 35 bought, and Lemao, Chengkang, and Hengfu also had digestive capacity. However, the selling was more surging. Numbers 10, 11, and 41 all had sales. Tongkang and Xieda also had sales. Market prices struggled several times, but still slowly declined. The market price was slightly lower by 2 or 3 jiao, and there is still a small face in the future. The market price ended up slightly lower by 5 to 9 jiao, with a total transaction volume of about 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Bond Type, Highest, Lowest, Closing, Compared to Previous Day

Unified A, 58.40, 57.80, 57.90, Down 0.50

Unified B, 52.40, 51.95, 51.95, Down 0.90

Unified C, 52.10, 51.70, 51.60, Down 0.65

Unified D, 50.90, 50.50, 50.45, Down 0.60

### Yarn and Cotton, Yarn Prices Continue to Fall, 20s Double Horse and Heavenly Maiden Fall Another 3 Yuan

The yarn market has entered a trough again, because customer sales have also turned sluggish, leading to a decline in morale. Therefore, although the multi-party has tried hard to pull up the prices, it is ultimately not allowed by the actual situation. The current market state is still one of hesitation, because the hope for the spring sales season has not been completely abandoned. Once the seasonal period passes, there may be a change. In the afternoon, the number of people at the meeting was even smaller, and the market situation was even more frustrated, due to the light trading.

Current yarn situation: At the morning opening, because customer trading was stagnant, it was not until after 10 o'clock that any market price was traded. Then, 10 bales were traded among peers, barely opening the market. The market was not much different from the previous day. The price of 20s Double Horse was again 395 yuan. Soon, due to the scarcity of business, market prices tended to decline. Finally, Double Horse was traded at 392 yuan and a half, and the warehouse bill price was 391 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. However, the prices of fine yarn and thread remained unchanged. In the afternoon, the market price continued to be weak, and current sales were scarce. 20s Double Horse fell another 5 jiao, and the warehouse bill plunged 2 yuan and 2 jiao and a half to 389 yuan. It was found that the total purchases of various groups throughout the day were 941 bales. The market price of 20s Double Horse yarn fell by 3 yuan compared to the previous day, and Heavenly Maiden fell by 3 yuan. However, the prices of fine yarn and thread were still firm due to the shortage of goods. The factory has not heard of any actions. Today, 380 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, and 25 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each group is recorded on the left: Peer 616, Mainland 170, Hong Kong 30, Wenzhou 25, Ningbo 20, Yunnan 35, Tianjin 35, Fuzhou 10, Total 841.

The Japanese yarn market is still bleak, and the needs of all parties are also scarce, so the market price has not changed much. The current price of 20s Water Moon yarn is 336 yuan and a half, and the current price of 20s Blue Phoenix yarn is 325 yuan and a half, which is not much different from last month.

### Native Cotton Sales Price Moves Forward

Tong Cotton Has Reached 78 Yuan, Trade Among Peers Is Extremely Lively

Native cotton business developed in shape, peers抵解头抵解头抵解头trade, extremely lively, so the market price moved forward, new peaks emerged one after another. Tongzhou cotton rose another 8 jiao compared to the past, the price was 78 yuan, and Huoji cotton still maintained a high price of 71 yuan. The actual reason is that the sources from all roads are scarce, so the holders of goods are particularly keen on raising prices. Although the selling price has reached the point where it cannot rise any further, the momentum is still high and strong. The future trend is unknown, but the factory's stomach is still stagnant, because the yarn price not only cannot move forward, but is falling behind. Yesterday, only Huari and two factories each entered 200 pieces. The goods arriving at the码头码头码头 included 520 bales of Xiasha fine weaving cotton. The current cotton trade situation and the amount of transactions are recorded on the left:

American type of bundled cotton 81.00 Yuanxingde entered 60 pieces Exchange bank receipt delivery

### American Cotton Will Enter the World Market and Compete with Other Cottons

Foreign cotton market prices, New York cotton market, in the early morning fell due to the deteriorating European situation and the clearing of long positions on Wall Street, and the market rose back with short covering, resulting in flat cotton prices. According to US Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wells, American cotton will soon enter the world cotton market and compete with other cottons. It is said that this special plan has been produced by the committee. Although the content of the plan has not been announced, it is well known that it includes subsidies for direct cotton exports. This move clearly implies that US government loans for cotton will be released soon. India rose another rupee yesterday, Egypt suspended trading, and the exchange rate yesterday did not change much. Converting to legal currency, US cotton, Brazilian cotton, and Egyptian cotton were all unchanged, but Indian cotton rose by 6 jiao.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, each factory has the intention to purchase foreign cotton. However, recently, Indian cotton has not been shipped out on the due date, and US government loans for cotton have not been released. Therefore, the purchase of American cotton, the grade of quality, could not be purchased at will, which is a pity. If American loan cotton can be released, it is good news for our cotton industry. Yesterday, Rongfeng Factory purchased 1,000 pieces of lower-grade American cotton, with the factory delivery price being 72 yuan and a half. Also, Shenxin once intended to order 1,000 pieces of Indian cotton of American seed and new special from Tiancheng Foreign Firm, with a limited price of 76 yuan, but the transaction did not take place because the price difference was too large. The cotton prices yesterday are listed below:

Yesterday morning, a foreign ship imported more than 200 pieces of American cotton. It was heard that a large amount of Indian cotton will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, 7,650 pieces, shipped from Karachi, India, by the Italian ship Cortellazzo, and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, berthing at the Gonghexing码头码头码头 in Hongkou for unloading.

### Japanese Rayon Dumping

Japanese rayon is being dumped in North China and the Yangtze River area in considerable quantities. Besides being shipped directly there, a significant amount also comes to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, a foreign vessel imported over 1,000 cases of rayon from Japan.

### Piece Goods Summer Light-Colored Cloths Experience Sudden Sales Surge

Domestic bleached light-colored piece goods are experiencing a surge in demand from this street and the Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian regions. High-end striped and plain printed poplins, ramie yarns, foreign yarns, printed cloths, bleached cloths, and other fine yarn woven products are especially popular, with sales prices rising sharply. Mass-produced, lower-grade poplins, bleached cloths, and dyed twills are still being purchased eagerly by merchants from eastern Zhejiang, Shanghai, Ningbo, and Jinhua. Yesterday's total transactions reached over 400 cases of coarse thread cloth, with sales prices slightly firm. However, striped bleached cloth produced by the British company Ewo (怡和) has increased by 2.5 jiao per piece, and bleached cloth has increased by 1.5 jiao. Various bleaching and finishing factories are extremely busy, with some unable to keep up with demand. In contrast, small-scale dyeing factories specializing in dyeing twill and originally colored cloths are mostly experiencing slack work, a stark contrast to the autumn and winter seasons. Retail business on this street shows clear signs of activity, with large transactions in both finished fine yarn fabrics and grey cloth. Wholesale business is also concentrated in eastern Zhejiang, for resale in the interior. Imports via land routes in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are lower in guerrilla areas, and completely halted in northern Jiangsu. White goods, especially fine cloth and coarse twill, are the firmest. Merchants from Ningbo and Taizhou continue to purchase over 100 pieces of fine cloth, and the amount of blue cloth they are purchasing is several times higher, but because they specify brands, sales have not been strong.

Sales prices for Dong goods (東貨, goods from Shandong Province) fine cloth and fine twill continued to rise firmly on the market yesterday. The highest price for "cage head" (籠頭) fine cloth is 11.9 yuan per piece, and for "colored ball" (彩球) fine cloth, 12.05 yuan. Actual sales of dyed grey cloth on this street remain strong. Including transactions with merchants from northern Jiangsu, futures trading in fine cloth and fine twill continues with over 1,000 pieces, but the difference between the trading price and the market price is about 2 jiao, making it difficult to reach agreement, so no deals were made.

Yesterday, 1,200 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin, another 190 pieces to Yantai, another 210 pieces to Shantou, and another 15 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Oil Cakes Raw Soybean Oil Under Manipulation, Price Rises Again by More Than One Yuan

Yesterday in Shantou, riding the momentum of the previous day, the market price was bullish, and everyone shared this sentiment, leading to speculative frenzy. The lively scene in the market was no less than the heyday of the exchange, with prices rising frequently and seemingly without end. Both spot and futures prices for raw soybean oil rose again by about one yuan yesterday. However, spot oil transactions were rare, due to the daily rise in prices and cargo owners tightly holding onto their prices, leading to a scarcity of active capital. In the future, there will inevitably be a day of stagnation. Under the influence of rising prices, and with the foreign firms' capital supply fluctuating, people were excited. The city-wide waves were quite tortuous. Statistics show 50 lots of Jiaozhou raw oil, 50 tins of Yantai raw oil, 50 lots of Lianqi soybean oil, and 30 lots of Dalian soybean oil were traded. 100 barrels of Dalian spot oil were traded, with 50 barrels to be delivered in two or three days, 100 barrels in four days, 150 barrels for delivery in March, 1,600-1,700 barrels for delivery in April, and 300 barrels for delivery in May. The Quanzhou merchants were buying 4,000+ oil cakes, each at 3.46 yuan, slightly higher than before. Dalian April/May futures oil cakes were heavily stockpiled by both industry insiders and outsiders, following the trend of the oil market, with a sharp increase of 0.04-0.05 yuan, and over 10,000 pieces were traded, at a price of 3.18 to 3.20 yuan. 4,000 small soybean cakes arrived from Zhanghuanggang yesterday.

### Miscellaneous Grains Futures Beans Soar

The spot bean market was very clear yesterday. Merchants from this street, Hong Kong, and Guangdong jointly purchased over 500 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans and 150 bags of Pinghu Du beans. The market was not much different from the previous market. Three carts of Dalian spot beans were traded at a price of 8.5 yuan, up 0.08 yuan. Foreign firms released 20-30 carts of April futures beans at a price of 8.40 to 8.43 yuan. The same industry traded four carts for delivery in May at a price of 8.48 yuan. Currently, Japanese merchants are still releasing few May contracts, because they still lack confidence due to the period of transition between harvests. Today, 650 bags of beans were exported to Shantou and 1,150 bags to Hong Kong.

### Seafood Wenzhou Dried Shrimp Available for Sale

Wenzhou dried shrimp have been arriving successively recently. Yesterday, a few cases of medium-grade goods were offered at a price of 55 yuan, and upper-medium-grade goods were asking for 60 yuan, but no transactions were made, and the trend is flat.

### Pepper Inventory is Thick

Pepper has recently been slow to move, and inventory is thick, so yesterday prices fell by one yuan, with No. 1 pepper at 58 yuan and black large pepper at 57 yuan.

### Northern and Southern Goods Xiamen Tangerine Cakes' Price Increase Limited

Melon Seeds Shipped from Tianjin

Xiamen tangerine cakes had a slight increase last week, with only a few dozen barrels of inventory in the market in total. Although the quantity is small, because sales are also few, the increase is limited. The listed price only increased by half a yuan, with over 30 barrels offered. Ordinary quality goods lack buyers because it is not the selling season.

2,000 bags of melon seeds were shipped from Tianjin yesterday.

### Sugar Market Chaozhou Sugar Production Prices Loosen, Tianjin Merchants Have Telegraphed Shantou to Stop Procurement

The sugar market trended soft yesterday. The association's set price for No. 24 coarse white spot goods did not fluctuate. Transshipment goods were quoted at 16.55 yuan, but no transactions were made. Dozens of bags of Taikoo's Car White B brand sugar from the Western Warehouse were traded at 24.725 yuan, CW brand at 24.6 yuan, CX at 24.5 yuan, DY brand at 24.4 yuan, and HX brand at 24.3 yuan. Domestic sugar listed prices showed slight sporadic offerings, with little fluctuation in price. It is heard that because Tianjin merchants had procured over 10,000 bags of Chaozhou sugar, and had since reached their quota, they telegraphed Shantou to stop procurement, and production prices immediately loosened by 0.02-0.03 yuan. Judging by the recent situation in the Shanghai market, since sales have not been smooth, there is also a continuing trend of loosening.

1,880 bags of sugar were shipped from Shantou yesterday.

### Hardware This Factory's Nails Are Sluggish

This factory's round nails once soared to 17.75 yuan, but later, due to weak actual sales and the arrival of Japanese goods, the market trended loose, with a double box (倍司) at 16.75 yuan, but transactions still showed no improvement. The market price fell again by 0.25 yuan. It is found that the market sold a little yesterday, a total of 700-800 barrels, which were bought by merchants from Ningbo, Fujian, Wenzhou, and Jiangbei. Transactions among construction merchants and small hardware merchants on this street remain sluggish.
