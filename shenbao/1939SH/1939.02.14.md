(Hong Kong) According to Haikou news received by foreigners in Guangzhou Bay, clear artillery fire could still be heard in Haikou on the 12th.

(Tokyo) The French Ambassador to Japan, Henri, visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning to meet with the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, representing the French government to discuss the issue of the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. According to an official announcement by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs afterwards, it stated, "The French Ambassador visited the Foreign Minister this morning, requesting clarification of the purpose and duration of the occupation of Hainan Island. Foreign Minister Arita immediately guaranteed that the occupation of Hainan Island is only for military reasons, to make the blockade of South China more effective. As for the duration of the occupation, it will not exceed military needs. Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is not out of territorial ambition." (13th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

(Tokyo) This morning, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated at a press conference that Japan has no territorial ambitions regarding Hainan Island, but it is premature to make statements about the island's future at this time, as the Japanese army is currently occupying the island due to military needs. The spokesperson then replied to a question from a foreign reporter, saying that the Japanese government has not yet considered the future status of Hainan Island. The Japanese government has repeatedly issued declarations that Japan has no territorial ambitions towards China, which can also be applied to Hainan Island. The Japanese army's occupation of the island has no relation to the maintenance of peace and order in the Pacific Ocean, contrary to what Chairman Chiang said to foreign reporters on Sunday. (13th Reuters Dispatch)

Arita also stated that Japan has no territorial ambitions towards Hainan Island. The conversation lasted forty minutes, and the French Ambassador thanked Arita for his explanation and left.

(Note: Under-Secretary Butler declared in the House of Commons on June 27th of last year, "If Japan occupies Hainan Island, then Britain and France will recognize it as deliberately causing unwelcome disputes, and Britain and France should provide mutual assistance to adapt to the situation.") (13th Havas Dispatch)

Japanese Attack on Hainan Island

### French Opinion Advocates Joint Anglo-French Action Against Japan; Japanese Warning to England and France; No Solution Other Than Cooperative Response

(Hong Kong) According to a dispatch from Paris, the right-wing Action Française newspaper commented on the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island, advocating that England and France should closely cooperate to deal with it, stating that France has requested Japan to explain the reasons, nature, and duration of this action, but we already know how much value the explanations Japan can offer. Japan is a signatory to the Sino-Belgian Treaty, and only the so-called natural desire to be satisfied is in their minds. Treaty promises can all be ignored. Therefore, the answers that Japan can offer will be either rude or delayed, and their fundamental meaning will never change. Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is nothing more than a warning to England and France, seeking to find the weaknesses of England and France in order to take advantage of them. Therefore, in this situation, England and France have no other solution than to unite and respond cooperatively. (13th Dispatch)

(London) The Manchester Guardian, a liberal newspaper, commented on the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, stating, "France is most concerned about this matter and should take various measures to prevent it. China signed an agreement with France in 1897, promising not to cede Hainan Island to any country. Japan also signed an agreement with France in 1907, recognizing that Hainan Island is within the scope of French interests. Last year, they blackmailed France, prohibiting the transport of military supplies from Vietnam to China, on the condition that they would not occupy the island. Later, Britain and France declared that if Japan occupied the island, Britain and France would feel uneasy. Unexpectedly, now they disregard everything and brazenly send troops to land on Hainan Island, and there seems to be no reason for this. Some say that this move coincided with the occupation of Minorca Island by the Spanish Nationalists, which was probably agreed upon with other signatories of the Anti-Comintern Pact, namely Germany and Italy. Otherwise, it may be a response to President Roosevelt's proposal to fortify Guam." (13th Havas Dispatch)

(Berlin) Regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, German newspapers all expressed their support, saying that Japan enjoys the right to expand and has the necessity to resist communism. These two ends alone are sufficient reasons for the country to occupy Hainan Island, regardless of what kind of constraints it had accepted before. The National Daily stated, "Last June, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler declared in the House of Commons that if Japan occupied Hainan Island, it would cause unpleasant disputes, but every time an omnipotent country mixes salt and pepper into the soup of a civil government, it only receives a protest. Japan will certainly be able to give a definite answer to this. The transformation of East Asia cannot be limited by outdated treaties, so even if there are protesters or those who try to interfere, they cannot stop the transformation. I hope that all civil governments can understand this meaning." The Frankfurter Zeitung stated, "Japan has full authority to take all legitimate measures to eliminate Bolshevism within China, so the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island is no different in nature from the Spanish Nationalists' occupation of Minorca Island. In short, since Japan needs space to survive, the occupation of Hainan Island is an important scene in the evolution of the situation on the Pacific coast." (13th Havas Dispatch)

(Rome) After the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, Italian newspapers all expressed their delight, saying that the prestige of the major civil governments has been damaged as a result. The Evening Post stated, "The major civil governments silently adhere to blind conservatism, turning a blind eye to the legitimate interests and historical rights of Italy and Germany, and have finally been taught a lesson in the Far East. It is what they deserved, and it will eventually affect them under their elbows, that is, in Europe and the Mediterranean. These countries only know how to be selfish and stingy, and will soon have nothing. This is what we are very happy about. Japan is a friendly country of Italy, and it is also one corner of the Anti-Comintern Tripartite Alliance. Italy does not feel anxious about its expansion policy, but is rather happy about it. On the contrary, the foolishness of those civil governments is boundless, which makes us worried. This situation can be compared to our reading of detective novels. We know that the thugs will have a day to go to jail or be executed, which is no different from the day when the civil governments will be overthrown." (13th Havas Dispatch)

### Air Combat Over Xia County

That night, the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to launch a night attack.

### Japanese Troops in Wuxing Stationed in Wuzhen

(Jinhua) Three hundred Japanese troops invaded Huawuzhen "southeast of Wuxing" again on the 5th. The Chinese guerrillas immediately abandoned their defense due to the disparity in numbers.

### Puppet Troops Near Baoding Defect

(Beiping) According to reliable Chinese sources, several thousand "Pacification Army" troops organized by the "Provisional Government" of Beiping recently fought against the Eighth Route Army near Baoding. As a result, the puppet army suffered hundreds of casualties. A small part of them resolutely defected and joined the Eighth Route Army. According to a young officer who defected, the remaining puppet troops are also willing to defect, but due to environmental constraints and the lack of time, they will eventually unite with us to fight against Japan sooner or later.

Editorial

### Japan-Germany-Italy Military Alliance

Rumors about the Japan-Germany-Italy military alliance have been circulating for a long time. According to yesterday's newspaper report, American journalist Cummings recently published a message in the "London Recorder" saying: "The Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan will be upgraded to a military alliance within a few weeks. Delegations from the Japanese army, navy, and various political parties have gone to Europe to participate in the conference held in Berlin to determine the final steps for the establishment of this tripartite military alliance." I remember two months ago, the Soviet news agency also reported that the Japan-Germany-Italy military alliance was about to be signed, but later it was said that Italy hoped to implement the Anglo-Italian Agreement and avoid causing Britain's displeasure, so it was temporarily delayed. Looking at the previous rumors together, and referring to the recent facts, we can know that this rumor is not unfounded.

In fact, the three fascist aggressors, Japan, Germany, and Italy, have been jointly attacking civil governments such as England, America, and France for quite some time. They all raise the banner of "anti-communism" to carry out their respective external aggressions. The Anti-Comintern Pact has been established for more than a year. How often have they actually "opposed communism"? Facts over the past year have proven that these three aggressors gathered under the banner of "anti-communism" are entirely targeting civil governments such as England, America, and France, as well as weak nations!

The Anti-Comintern Pact itself is no different from an alliance of aggression. They use the name of "anti-communism" to carry out the reality of aggression. They put on this guise, collude with each other, echo each other from east to west, and jointly attack civil governments to realize their individual non-conflicting aggressive ambitions. Specifically, Japan colludes with Germany to contain the Soviet Union, and colludes with Italy to threaten England and France, so that England, France, and the Soviet Union cannot actively aid China, so that Japan can annex China and dominate the Far East; Hitler wants to use Japan's military power to endanger the security of the Soviet Union's eastern border; and to fuel Italy's ferocity, to threaten the cooperation of England and France, and to intensify the pressure on France; so that Germany can expand to Central and Eastern Europe to realize the fantasy of a Greater German Empire; as for Mussolini, he dreams of establishing a "New Roman Empire" by conquering Spain and expanding his interests in Africa, so he needs to cooperate with Japan to threaten England and France from the Far East, and to connect with Berlin to control Paris and London. In short, although there are contradictions between the three fascist aggressor countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy with "different dreams in the same bed," they have their own basis for collusion in order to achieve their respective aggressive goals. Indeed, today their "unity" outweighs their contradictions, and the fact that they are implementing attacks on civil governments such as England and France in the East and West separately is the best proof.

In Europe, the Berlin-Rome aggression axis is currently gambling in Spain, and if their gamble wins, not only Spain itself will be sacrificed, but also France and England. In these days, the Spanish government has suffered repeated losses, and Mussolini is becoming more and more arrogant. 30,000 Blackshirts have been sent to Libya one after another, threatening France and British Egypt and Sudan; Italy's semi-official newspapers have made even greater anti-French remarks; the island of Mayorca in the Balearic Islands has been occupied by Italy, and Minorca Island will inevitably suffer the same fate sooner or later.

Just as Italy is stirring up trouble in the Mediterranean, preparing to occupy Minorca Island, Japan is also responding "in the echo" in the East, stepping foot on Hainan Island, creating the "September 18th Incident in the Pacific." The significance of Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is serious. If it occupies Hainan Island, it will not only cut off the transportation between Hong Kong and Singapore, not only endanger France's territories in the Far East, not only threaten the Philippines and Guam, but also be able to advance westward from the Indian Ocean to peep into the Mediterranean, establish contact with Germany and Italy, and open up a new situation for the triangular alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. A German journalist said: "The Italian Empire is a bridge connecting the African continent and the Indian Ocean." Japan is the Far East naval power in this triangle, and she is gradually using Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Hainan Island to pave the stones to build a bridge between the Japanese Empire and the German-Italian axis!

At the same time that Japan and Italy are making trouble from the East and West, Hitler is also plotting. According to an article published in the "Business Report" by the famous French journalist Madame Tabouis, "Germany is making the necessary military preparations to exercise the blackmailing methods it had exercised before the Munich Conference between March 6th and 10th this year and to make various demands for itself and Italy."

From the many facts above, we can know that the three aggressors, Japan, Germany, and Italy, are attacking England and France using a strategy of east-west flanking, and we can prove that the rumors of the Japan-Germany-Italy military alliance are not unfounded. Under the step-by-step concessions of England and France, the fascism's aggression and madness is increasing day by day! If civil governments such as England and France can immediately change their course and unite to prevent the aggressors from expanding their provocations, it is not too late today. Otherwise, if we continue to indulge the aggressors' rampant ways, I am afraid that tomorrow there will be a danger of "it is too late to regret."

### Puppet Illegally Occupies Japanese Embassy: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement: Japan Bears Responsibility for Safekeeping Embassy Property and Will Be Fully Responsible for Any Future Changes

(Chongqing) According to a recent report from the Japanese Domei News Agency, personnel dispatched to Japan by the puppet organizations in Nanjing and Peiping illegally occupied the former Chinese embassy property in Japan on the 4th of this month. Regarding this matter, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a statement as follows: When our embassy in Japan was ordered to withdraw in June of last year, it submitted a signed inventory of all movable and immovable property of the embassy to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for verification. The Japanese Ministry dispatched personnel to take inventory and assume responsibility for safekeeping, jointly with personnel designated by the embassy. The Japanese side sealed all doors and windows of the embassy at that time. At the request of the Japanese side, the safekeeping fee was handed over to the Japanese side and received. At the same time, Horiuchi Kensuke, a decision-maker at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, replied in a letter to Yang Yunzhu, the acting representative of our embassy, formally stating that "the property of your embassy will be fully protected in accordance with the principles of international law." Thus, the Japanese government not only bears the responsibility of safekeeping our embassy property under international law, but also formally accepted this responsibility in fact. Now, it has instigated puppet organization personnel to seize our embassy property. This is not only a violation of international law, but also a disregard for international trust. Recalling that in August of the year before last, after the personnel of the Japanese embassy in China withdrew from Nanjing, our side always strictly protected the Japanese embassy property. The condition of the embassy remained unchanged until the Japanese army invaded Nanjing. Even the Japanese side expressed admiration for this point. How different is this from the Japanese side's violation of its promises? In short, the Japanese government has the obligation to be responsible for safekeeping our embassy property in Japan. In the future, if any changes are discovered in the current state of the embassy property compared to when it was sealed, the Japanese government should bear full responsibility. (13th dispatch)

### Spanish Nationalist Government Not Yet Recognized by Britain and France: Hoping to Promote Peace Negotiations and Still Uneasy About Italy's Ambitions

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the British government is in close contact with France regarding the recognition of the Nationalist Government, but no decision has been made so far. (13th Reuters dispatch)

(London) The British government is now paying attention to the legal issues arising from the de facto control of most of Spain by General Franco. It is heard that the British government's attitude will depend on the circumstances. The British side very much hopes that the Spanish Civil War will end soon. Therefore, it has expressed its attitude to the Nationalist authorities. If the Nationalist Government can guarantee that it will not implement terror and retaliatory acts after the peace talks, then recognition will be more convenient. As for Britain's attitude towards the Republican government, it is expected that it will continue to recognize the government as long as it can maintain authority over most of Spain. However, this move cannot be regarded as encouraging the Republican government to continue to resolutely resist at any cost. Currently, there is very close contact between the British and French governments, and any decision made by the British side will be consistent with the decision of France. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(London) It was learned today from well-informed political circles that Britain will continue its efforts this week in the hope of ending the Spanish Civil War and safeguarding its economic, political, and military interests in the Mediterranean. The Nationalist Government's representative, Haggerson, has returned to his post and will present important issues to the Nationalist authorities in the coming days, such as a cessation of hostilities, British recognition of the Nationalist Government, and the withdrawal of German and Italian troops. British political circles believe that Republican Prime Minister Negrín has decided to continue the war with his central army in order to extract better peace terms from the Nationalists. Therefore, Haggerson will ask General Franco to show generosity so that the government forces may be able to quickly negotiate a peace. (13th Associated Press dispatch) (Paris) The Times reported today that the bombing of the British cruiser Devonshire while sailing to Minorca is particularly related to the question of British and French recognition of the Spanish Nationalist Government. The Italian aircraft bombing a British warship during the course of the recognition negotiations may indicate that the actions of the Italian army violate the wishes of General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, and raise doubts about Mussolini's guarantee that Italy has no political or economic ambitions in Spain. General Franco must now be extremely concerned to eliminate this discrepancy between words and deeds in order to demonstrate his own authority. It is clear that the issue of British recognition of the Nationalist Government has now been launched, and such recognition can only be given to a free and independent Spain that can defend its interests in the Mediterranean. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(London) Regarding the future political system of Spain, British political figures firmly believe that no pressure can be applied to General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces. In other words, whether the country restores the monarchy should be left to its own decision. According to news from Burgos, the Nationalist side seems to have the intention of having the deposed heir to the throne, Prince Juan, succeed to the throne. If this is true, it would be the best way to achieve unity, since the royal family did not participate in the civil war and its position is relatively detached. In addition, the restoration of the monarchy would be enough to demonstrate that Spain's independent sovereignty has not been impaired, which would be of great value. However, the German newspapers have already clearly opposed this proposal, saying that if Spain is restored to the monarchy, it will no longer be able to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. The organ of the Chinese National Socialist Party, "The Attack," also stated that the Spanish Nationalist Government should join the Anti-Comintern Pact as soon as it wins victory. However, well-informed sources here believe that if the Nationalist Government joins the Anti-Comintern Pact, it would contradict General Franco's repeated statements of determination to maintain Spain's complete independence, which would be disturbing.

### Southern Ireland Recognizes Nationalist Government: Switzerland and Poland Have Also Decided

Dublin: The Southern Irish government has officially recognized the Spanish Nationalist Government today and has appointed its minister to the Spanish Republic, Kearney, as minister to the Nationalist Government, who has already departed to take up his new post.

(13th Havas dispatch)

Warsaw: It is heard that the Polish government will officially recognize the Nationalist Government today or tomorrow. (13th Havas dispatch)

### Soviet Red Army: 21st Anniversary: Authorities Preparing Celebrations

(Moscow) February 23rd is the 21st anniversary of the Red Army. The entire Soviet Union is uniformly preparing to hold celebrations. For example, the Council of the Aviation Chemical Defense Association of Moscow is organizing a mass shooting competition with over 7,000 participants. The Lepel region of the Byelorussian SSR will hold mass tactical exercises with 1,500 participants, including Voroshilov marksmen and grenadiers. Over 1,000 of them will participate in tactical shooting competitions. In addition, the general public is studying light and heavy machine gun shooting techniques, hand grenade throwing, and other military techniques with great enthusiasm. (12th Tass dispatch)

### Republican Government Personnel All Return to Madrid: Issuing Declaration to Continue Resistance: Nationalists Bombard for Half an Hour

Madrid: Madrid was heavily bombarded by the Nationalist artillery for half an hour. Shortly afterward, Republican government personnel arrived from Valencia. (12th Reuters dispatch)

Valencia: The Official Gazette has now resumed publication, and its first order stipulates that the headquarters of the Bank of Spain and other institutions be located in Madrid. The Gazette also republished the order issued on February 11th, still designating Madrid as the seat of government. It also announced that Major Generals Miaja and Rojo have been promoted to Lieutenant General. (13th Reuters dispatch)

Madrid: After returning to Madrid, the Republican Government Cabinet held its first cabinet meeting this afternoon and issued an official gazette calling on the government and the people to continue the war. Interior Minister Gómez said at the initial decision meeting in Valencia, "I cannot say when this decision meeting will last, but this meeting is a continuation of the meeting in Valencia." The government then issued a statement saying, "At this first cabinet meeting in Madrid, the government sincerely expresses its respect to the army, navy, air force, and the people of the Western government. The government is currently completing its great mission, and we are determined to deal with all the efforts and need to cooperate with the people to forge a strong national front. We are in danger of being destroyed if we do not save ourselves, but we will put life and death aside, and the determination to fight will double the resistance to save ourselves from danger." (12th Associated Press dispatch)

Madrid: All members of the Republican government cabinet returned here today and held a cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Negrín. Afterwards, a declaration was published in the newspapers, expressing respect to the soldiers of the army, navy, and air force who defended the country. It was said that during this war of resistance, although morale was extremely high, it still needed to be continuously improved. All nationals must unite, and all political parties and organizations must abandon prejudices and only take victory in the war as their goal. It is deeply believed that victory will be ours. (12th Havas dispatch)

Madrid: After the members of the Republican government cabinet returned here yesterday and held a cabinet meeting, a declaration was immediately issued, clarifying the need for continued resistance and national unity. All sectors of society read it and expressed their approval, and praised the government's spirit of continued efforts, and said that the close unity of the cabinet proved that the rumors that the moderate members and the left-wing members of the cabinet disagreed were pure rumors. (13th Havas dispatch)

Madrid: After the Republican government moved back to Madrid, the Nationalist artillery bombarded the city fiercely this morning. Many shells landed in the central area of the city from 10:30 am, and other areas were also affected. The shelling stopped at 11:15 am. Many residents were killed and injured, and ambulances transported the wounded back and forth without stopping. (12th Havas dispatch)

Madrid: Jétiva, on the Alicante to Valencia railway, was raided today by Nationalist aircraft, killing over a hundred people. Alicante was also raided, killing twenty and injuring fifty-five. Madrid was shelled with one hundred and twenty rounds, killing sixteen and injuring twenty-three. A lot of property was damaged. (12th Reuters dispatch)

Madrid: The Nationalist air raids in various parts of the Mediterranean and its half-hour shelling of Madrid this week resulted in one hundred and sixty-four deaths and one hundred and forty-three injuries. The towns raided by aircraft were Jétiva on the railway from Alicante to Valencia, and Alcoy, sixty miles south of Valencia. (13th Reuters dispatch)

Perpignan: The fighting in Catalonia has not completely stopped. Two divisions of the Republican army, a total of 25,000 men, are still holding Comprodon and the two towns from Comprodon to the border. They are currently engaged in rear-guard actions to await the withdrawal of the wounded and war materials into France. Its communication line relies entirely on mountain roads, one of which is on a cliff. Because the Republican army could not transport its trucks into France, it dropped them off the cliff. The number is no less than a hundred. (13th Reuters dispatch)

Burgos: The Spanish Nationalists must now look at the attitude of the Republican government to decide what action to take. According to what is said here, if Republican Prime Minister Negrín or Republican General Miaja implement a policy of resolute resistance and achieve their goal of retaining the remaining Republican areas, then the war will inevitably enter an unavoidable path. At that time, the Nationalist forces will begin to advance towards Madrid within a considerable period. (12th Reuters dispatch)

(London) Regarding the Spanish issue, political figures here recently declared that although the Republican government has moved back to Madrid, there is no significant change in the situation of the civil war. The move by Western European countries to recognize the Nationalist government as the legitimate government does not need to be delayed because of this. The Republican government may not be able to support itself for long after continuing the war, and it is difficult to change the fact that three-quarters of the national territory of Spain is controlled by the Nationalist government. In this way, the recognition of the Nationalist government and us does not need to be entirely dependent on how long the Republican government continues to resist. According to news from Madrid, opinions within the Republican government are not consistent regarding the major plan of resistance. The main purpose of continuing the war is to coerce the Nationalist authorities so that they can obtain more lenient armistice conditions. For this reason, the key to the future attitude of the British and French governments towards Spain does not lie in the nature and position of the Republican government after the relocation of the capital, but in the political plans of Britain and France themselves.

### British Fleets Hold Separate Exercises; Gibraltar Fortress Commander Visits French Territory in North Africa

(London) The Admiralty has announced that the entire British Mediterranean Fleet and a portion of the Home Fleet will conduct exercises between March and April. Several warships will also visit ports in France and Italy. In addition, the Australian Commonwealth, the New Zealand Dominion, and the fleets stationed in China will concentrate at Sydney, Australia, next month. (Havas, 13th)

Gibraltar: General Ironside, commander of the fortress in this port, accompanied by his staff, departed this afternoon aboard the cruiser HMS Newcastle, escorted by the cruiser HMS Glasgow and two submarines, to visit General Noguès, the Resident General of Morocco, at Casablanca, French Morocco.

### New German Battleship Launched Today; 35,000 Tons

(Berlin) Germany's first new battleship of 35,000 tons will be launched tomorrow at the port of Hamburg. Führer Hitler, along with various dignitaries, will attend the grand ceremony.

### British Industry Representatives to Visit Germany Next Month to Negotiate Market Sharing

(London) A delegation from the Federation of British Industries, led by Sir Ralk, chairman of the Federation's Tariffs and Commercial Relations Committee, will travel to Germany next month to negotiate with representatives of the Federation of German Industries. The president of the Federation of British Industries, Penlight, may also personally attend. It is reported that these negotiations will last two to three days. (Havas, 12th)

(London) Glundy, chairman of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, stated in his annual address today that maintaining export trade is the government's practical responsibility, as important as maintaining our transportation methods and defense to ensure national security. In 1929, the total value of cotton yarn and manufactured goods exports was 135 million pounds sterling, but last year it had fallen to 50 million pounds. The only solution to this problem is to tell each country's government that desires or needs our assistance, such as sales of their products, financial aid, and political assistance, in the simplest and most decisive terms: "If your government's application is to be approved by us, the condition is that your government sympathize with us and find ways to allow us to sell manufactured goods in your country's market according to established rights. As for the tax rates levied, this is your country's business, but if you do not agree with our right to enjoy, then we cannot continue to allow your country's products to be sold in our country's market, nor can we continue to give your country the other forms of assistance it has received in the past." Mr. Glenn also stated that Britain is the world's largest sales market for imported goods. If the government is determined to utilize it, then the transactional power that this market gives to the government must be very great. (Reuters, 13th)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons on the 10th of this month that the British government believes that the proper resolution of various international issues is the only way to establish lasting peace. However, because this is a major undertaking, meticulous preparations must be made first. Informed sources here recently explained that Prime Minister Chamberlain's intention is that convening an international conference to resolve the various current difficulties in the international situation must first find successful conditions before it can be put into practice. Preparations should be made in both economic and political aspects. The appeasement policy promoted by Prime Minister Chamberlain is a political preparation. This policy was demonstrated by the Munich Agreement in September of last year. Although the war crisis was avoided as a result, the situation in Europe still failed to ease. Until recently, Prime Minister Chamberlain has taken a tougher stance towards Germany and Italy. Economic and financial figures in Britain, in view of the failure of the appeasement policy, advocated that democratic countries should strive for economic recovery in order to attract totalitarian countries to cooperate with them, thereby achieving the goal of appeasement politically. The reason is that totalitarian countries are dynamic, and democratic countries must maintain even greater dynamism to offset them. The method is for Britain, France, and the United States to achieve prosperity in the economic field, and then force all totalitarian countries to abandon their main weapons, in other words, to force these countries to abandon their closed-door economic policies. Britain, France, and the United States hold more than 90% of the world's total gold reserves, and the raw materials produced by these countries also account for more than 80% of the world's total. It is only necessary to find a way to set a rate for their currencies and determine import tax rates, and then mutual trade can be developed to the greatest extent, and economic prosperity can be achieved in one fell swoop. Regarding the stabilization of currency prices, Britain, France, and the United States must jointly use their gold reserves. This measure is harmless. Speculators do not have enough capital to compete with them and will naturally retreat. In short, once the currency prices of Britain and Italy are stable, all other difficulties can be expected to be solved easily. (Havas, 12th)

### Riots in India and Burma; Major Fire in London

〇 Kanpur, India: Riots broke out again here this morning. Police were forced to fire eight times, injuring 35 people. Since the riots began on Saturday, a total of twenty people have died and 235 have been injured. During the disturbances this morning, British Police Superintendent Whitehouse was slightly injured. Four arson cases occurred within one hour this morning. All commercial activities here have completely stopped due to the tense situation. (Reuters, 13th)

Kanpur, India: Last night and at dawn this morning, riots broke out repeatedly between Hindus and Muslims here, resulting in 20 deaths and 200 injuries. 500 people were arrested. Authorities mobilized police from surrounding areas of the city to suppress the riots. Some well-known British people are also assisting in the rescue work. This riot was caused by Muslims opposing Hindus playing music in front of a certain mosque, which had been brewing for several days and finally erupted. The authorities have strictly enforced martial law and implemented other precautions to prevent further riots. (Reuters, 13th)

Rangoon: According to statistics from the Rangoon Police Department, the recent riots in Burma have resulted in 28 deaths and 82 injuries. Yesterday, a bomb was thrown at the Victory Hotel in downtown Rangoon, which immediately exploded, destroying all glass windows and doors. (Haitong, 13th)

(London) The largest music academy here, Birmingham, suddenly caught fire yesterday. Although 13 fire engines worked hard to put out the fire, they were ultimately unable to extinguish it due to the great intensity of the fire. The loss is estimated to be over 30,000 pounds. Police immediately closed nearby streets and searched for suspicious people, as it is widely believed that this major fire was started by the Irish Republican Army. (Haitong, 13th)

(London) According to reliable sources here, the Scottish Police Department recently found an important document containing information about the Irish Republican Army's secret organization in England. The location of its secret agency has now been discovered. It is said that the Republican Army holds secret meetings once a week, usually in central England, specializing in supplying explosives and directing bombing conspiracies. It is widely believed that its headquarters are currently located in Manchester. (Haitong, 13th)

### Hull Speech; Upholding the Rights of American Nationals; The United States Has Concerns about being Drawn into the Vortex of War, and Must Strengthen National Defense to Seek Self-Defense

(Washington) U.S. Secretary of State Hull delivered a radio address to the world last night, stating that under the current world situation, maintaining sufficient defensive forces is the sacred responsibility of any government worthy of the name. A new demon of great war is at work in the world, so the issue of war and peace has become a tense and personal matter. As a nation, we believe that there is no international issue that cannot be resolved peacefully. However, we also know that sometimes, due to environmental factors, countries that are willing to abide by peace may be hindered by the actions of other countries. (Reuters, 12th)

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull delivered a radio address this evening, stating that the United States also has the possibility of being drawn into the vortex of war. The interests of the United States, which are most precious and most relevant to its survival, may be threatened or attacked by other countries. Since the American nation is a free nation, its only response to such provocative actions is resistance and courageous self-defense. At this time, the international situation is fraught with crises, and the whole world is anxious about a future large-scale war. The issue of war and peace has become a problem of concern to everyone. Our families, factories, cities, and villages are constantly affected by this issue. At this time, the most important and fundamental thing for the government in diplomacy is how to maintain its own country's peace. The United States has a desire for peace, but the desires of countries that love peace are often hindered by the actions of other countries. In other words, if both parties involved do not have peace in their hearts, then a peaceful solution cannot be established. Hull then concluded that the U.S. government's duty when dealing with other governments is to maintain the rights enjoyed by its citizens abroad and to provide them with full and legal protection, while at the same time defining fair boundaries for the rights held by its citizens abroad. (Havas, 12th)

### U.S. Fleet Holds Large-Scale Atlantic Exercises; Line Three Thousand Miles Long; Lasting Two to Three Weeks; First Time in Five Years

San Juan, Puerto Rico: An unprecedented large-scale U.S. naval exercise has begun in the Atlantic Ocean in the middle of the night, with its line extending over three thousand miles. Participants include 150 warships and 600 aircraft, all engaged in solving "Problem Twenty." President Roosevelt personally inspected the exercise aboard the cruiser USS Houston. The exercise will last two to three weeks. The Navy is divided into black and white teams. The white team takes the offensive, planning to capture the West Indies as a base for operations against the United States. The black team takes the defensive, using Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as bases, with the aim of preventing invasion and destroying the enemy. This exercise, with a line of three thousand miles, extending south to Brazil, began in early January. The entire U.S. Navy has been gathered in the Atlantic, using Guantanamo as a base. Most of them are preparing for exercises. This is the first Atlantic exercise in five years. The number of U.S. naval aircraft gathered here has never been so large. All ships, including submarines and aircraft, joining both the offensive and defensive sides will operate day and night, conducting exercises to demonstrate their maritime prowess under assumed wartime conditions. Officially speaking, the concentration of the U.S. fleet on the east coast is purely for training and to view the New York World's Fair. However, people outside the naval community say that this move has a deeper meaning. A member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that he had heard from responsible parties that the government's purpose was to make Europeans realize that it is in their best interest to abandon promoting totalitarianism in South America and to make South American countries understand that the United States has the ability to assist them in repelling foreign attacks. According to naval sources, after the exercise, the fleet will gather in the Guantanamo area for various tactical and artillery exercises. After the exercises are completed, they will go to New York to visit the World's Fair and will stop at Norfolk along the way. At that time, it will be mid-April. The entire fleet can sail back to the west coast in early June. (Reuters, 13th)

(Washington) The U.S. Pacific and Atlantic fleets are preparing for the second phase of exercises in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (U.S. naval base), the progress of which is extremely secret, namely the Panama Canal Zone offensive and defensive exercises. This has now been completed. As soon as tomorrow morning, the "White Fleet," under the command of Rear Admiral Carf, will attack the Panama Canal Zone. The "Black Fleet," under the command of Rear Admiral Andrews, will be responsible for defense. The offensive and defensive plans are unknown to each other and will be reported in code to Commander-in-Chief General Lock. Only General Lock knows how to decipher this code, and he will use it to judge the outcome. President Roosevelt will travel to the Canal Zone on the 16th of this month aboard the cruiser USS Houston to observe a portion of the exercises. This exercise will last three weeks, with a total of 140 warships and 600 aircraft participating, and 60,000 naval officers and men. The location ranges from the north coast of Florida in the United States to the northern coast of Brazil. This is the first time in five years that the U.S. Navy has repeatedly held exercises in the Atlantic Ocean. (Havas, 12th)

### Brazilian Foreign Minister Socializes in the United States

(Washington) Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha has been here for many days. He was originally scheduled to meet with President Roosevelt today, but because the President is feeling unwell and has not yet recovered, he was unable to meet as scheduled. Yesterday, Foreign Minister Aranha met with various friends throughout the day and sent a memorandum on the financial and economic situation of Brazil to Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau for reference. In recent days, in addition to meetings with U.S. officials, Foreign Minister Aranha has also met with Bell, a giant in the U.S. arms industry. Bell has always supported the policies promoted by President Roosevelt and advocates that the United States should purchase various raw materials from Brazil, such as manganese, rubber, and other products, and believes that Brazil is a reliable source of resources that will not be cut off from the United States even in the event of war. In addition, informed sources also said that Foreign Minister Aranha came here to urge the U.S. authorities to vigorously manage South America in order to prevent certain countries from preempting it, and informed the U.S. authorities that South American countries feel that the United States has lost various opportunities in South America in the past. For example, the Colombian Ambassador to the United States once informed the U.S. government that his country was willing to purchase locomotives and railway materials in the United States, but because of the Johnson Act (which stipulates that the United States may not lend funds to any country that has failed to repay principal and interest on its debts to the United States as scheduled), it was unable to obtain credit loans in the United States and was forced to purchase these goods in Europe. (Havas, 30th)

### Japan Participating in Naval Competition; Plans for New Warship Construction

(Tokyo) During a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Subcommittee on the 7th of this month, Naval Minister Yonai announced that a new naval shipbuilding plan would soon be submitted to the Diet in order to cope with the shipbuilding competition of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries. Therefore, a supplementary budget proposal will be submitted around the end of this month. Yonai did not announce the plan that was set, and even if it is submitted to the Diet, its contents may not be announced, because since Japan withdrew from the London Naval Treaty, it has absolutely kept its shipbuilding plans secret. Japan is no longer bound by any naval treaties, so it has no obligation to notify or exchange information with other countries regarding its naval plans. If anything, it is only with Germany and Italy. As for whether Japan's new shipbuilding plan will be added to the currently under construction Third Naval Replenishment Plan, or whether it will be called the Fourth Replenishment Plan, it is not yet known. However, its intention is obviously to increase the strength of the Third Plan. Japan's naval replenishment plan began in 1930, drafted and completed after the signing of the London Naval Treaty, requiring a total of 372 million yuan, with a period of three years. However, in reality, this plan was not completed until 1936. Its contents are as follows: four 8,500-ton cruisers, one 7,100-ton aircraft carrier, twelve destroyers, nine submarines, one submarine supply ship, thirteen small warships such as gunboats, and fourteen aircraft squadrons. In 1933, former Naval Minister Osumi submitted the Second Naval Replenishment Plan to the Diet, which was completed by the end of 1936, stipulating one 8,000-ton aircraft carrier, one 8,500-ton cruiser, six destroyers, six submarines, one mine-laying boat, eight torpedo boats and submarine chasers, and five aircraft squadrons. Due to the competition from other naval countries, its Second Plan was subsequently expanded in July of that year, totaling one 10,000-ton aircraft carrier, one 8,500-ton cruiser, seven destroyers, and three aircraft squadrons. The Second Plan cost a total of 600 million yuan. The Third Naval Replenishment Plan began in 1937. The budget proposal submitted to the Diet at the same time also listed a new five-year shipbuilding plan, requiring a total of 1.2 billion yuan, of which more than 800 million yuan was for shipbuilding. Although officials strictly keep the contents secret, it is widely believed that this plan stipulates the construction of four 40,000-ton battleships, each equipped with 16-inch guns, two aircraft carriers, and a number of cruisers and destroyers. In addition, there will be a major increase in the naval air force. The new plan proposed by the Naval Minister is to supplement the Third Shipbuilding Plan, because Japan is unwilling to fall behind in the current unrestricted naval competition of major powers.

### Funeral of the Late Pope; 200,000 People Paid Tribute; Most Waited Outside the Church All Night; New Pope to be Elected on the 1st of Next Month

Vatican City: The Pope's funeral is scheduled to be held at 4:00 PM on Tuesday. People from all walks of life, including many who gathered outside St. Peter's Basilica all night, waited for the church to open at 8:00 AM this morning, and passed in an orderly fashion in front of the Pope's remains. Sixteen people stood around the coffin, holding torches, so that believers could kiss the Pope's feet in the light. It is estimated that a total of 200,000 people paid their last respects to the Pope from morning until the church closed at 7:00 PM. Military stoves were set up in the church to cook food for the poor. Vendors outside the church sold badges with the Pope's portrait, which were purchased in large numbers. The crowd waited for several hours, many holding rosaries and murmuring prayers. The cordon of police around the church was broken through by the crowd from time to time. (Reuters, 12th)

Vatican City: According to reliable sources, the College of Cardinals has decided to meet on the 1st of next month to elect a new Pope, so that Cardinals from South American countries can arrive in time to attend the funeral of the late Pope Pius XI. The funeral is scheduled to be held on the 14th of this month, and Bishop Beru, Secretary of the Latin Literature Association, will deliver the eulogy at that time. (Havas, 12th)

Vatican City: Preparations for the Pope's election are currently underway here and are extremely busy. According to custom, each Cardinal participating in the election may bring a secretary and a servant, all of whom will be provided with accommodation and meals by the Vatican, totaling more than 300 people. Accommodation is all located near the Damasus Courtyard. At the same time, Cardinals are not allowed to have any contact with each other. The roads from their residences to the Sistine Chapel, the election site, are completely separated and partitioned with wooden boards. In addition, the floor of the Sistine Chapel is old and uneven, and is currently being renovated. The seats in the church are divided into two types: one covered with purple silk tablecloths, which are the seats of the Cardinals appointed by the late Pope Pius XI, and the other covered with green silk tablecloths, which are the seats of the Cardinals appointed by the previous Popes before Pius XI.

### Hainan Island and French Interests in the Far East

— Translated by Bu San

(Translated from the "China National Magazine," Issue 108, published in Shanghai. Original article by Tian Boli) (1)

In recent years, French interests in the Far East have increased rapidly, to an unprecedented extent. The factors contributing to this development can be divided into the following categories: (1) economic, (2) military strategic, and (3) territorial. First, in terms of economics, French investment in the Far East has increased rapidly, particularly in the establishment of air routes in the Far East and the construction of railways in southern and southwestern China.

French investment in Annam has totaled 2.5 billion francs over the past 50 years. Since the end of the European War in 1914, French investment in Annam has increased sixfold compared to the pre-war period, which demonstrates the speed of this growth. French investment in China totals as much as 600 million gold francs, most of which is used for loans, with very little used for commerce. Of the 10,000 foreign commercial institutions in China, only 200 are under the protection of the French tricolor flag.

In the early 20th century, London held the reins of global financial capital. France sought to compete with Britain, allowing for extensive investment in China, such as providing large loans to the Chinese government. Therefore, the leading lender to China was Britain, followed by France. In early 1937, France held 210 million francs worth of Chinese government securities and bonds, nearly a quarter of China's total foreign debt, of which 15 percent was borrowed by the Chinese government to build railways. In early 1938, French financial circles and the Chinese government or various financial groups signed many loan contracts for railway construction and various enterprises. The total loan amount reached as much as 68 million francs, accounting for 6% of the total foreign loans to China. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway loan at the end of 1936 was also provided by France. According to this loan agreement, France promised to lend China 34.5 million Chinese dollars, of which 7 million was in cash, and the remainder was converted into railway materials.

We can say that this was the beginning of large-scale French loans to China, but if the Sino-Japanese War had not occurred, French industry had also planned to supply China with materials worth 300 million francs. Unfortunately, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and this plan was canceled. Although the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied rumors about French loans for the construction of the Nanning to Annam border Nasan (transliteration) railway, the Japanese side still believed it to be true.

The largest French investment in the Far East is the construction of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. This railway is one meter wide and 852 kilometers long, of which 388 kilometers are in Yunnan and 464 kilometers are in Annam. It was completed before the European War in 1914, costing a total of 165 million gold francs, and can be called a masterpiece of French engineers. Although the railway is the private property of a French company, it is subsidized by the Annam government and is, in some respects, subject to the control of the French government. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the railway's income has increased to an unprecedented level due to its importance as a major transportation line. In the first four months of 1938, income was 60 million francs, and net profit increased to more than 8%. In the same period in 1937, income was only 45 million francs.

French real estate and commercial activities in China are almost entirely concentrated in the four French concessions of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Shamian, with the Shanghai French Concession being the most important, accounting for about three-fifths of France's total investment in China. Although France and Annam account for only 5% of China's total foreign trade, they rank fifth in terms of exports to China and fourth in terms of imports from China, just ahead of Germany. From China's perspective, China's purchase of goods from Annam is only second to France, ranking second among Annam's customers. We also hope that China, especially southern China, will become a large market for Annam's exports.

Yunnan is the region with the richest tin reserves in China. Due to the province’s adjacency with Annam, France has profited handsomely from mining tin in the region. The largest French tin mine in Yunnan is the Gejiu Tin Mine near Mengzi. The French will build a branch line from the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to connect it, so as to transport tin for export.

Japan's active development in South China is a matter of great concern, with fears that Japan will use economic needs as an excuse to seize tin mines, which is a major concern for the French. Once Japan gains control of tin mines in South China, it will no longer rely on tin production from the Malay Archipelago and will become self-sufficient. Conversely, to meet its domestic tin needs, France will have to seek it elsewhere.

Guangxi Province is also of great interest to the French because of its proximity to Annam, and Frenchmen are very interested in its mineral resources. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese and French representatives conducted negotiations on cooperative mining of Guangxi's mineral resources, but they were halted due to the war. If this plan could be realized, French industry could greatly benefit from selling railway materials and transportation equipment to China. For this reason, a railway was also planned to run from Guangxi to Yunnan, to be completed within two years, and this plan had even reached the stage of implementation. If it can be built, it will of course also have great military strategic significance. (To be continued)

### The Past and Present of Finance in Yunnan Province (Continued) More Than a Dozen Newly Moved Banks Issue Three Types of Paper Currency

Organizing an Association: The Kunming financial community, in order to strengthen the ties among colleagues in the industry, plans to organize a bankers' association. Preparations have already begun, with the participation of nine banks, including Central, China, Communications, Farmers, Jincheng, Judiancheng, Fudian, Xinhua, and Shanghai. Miao Yuntai has been appointed as the chairman, and the managers of each bank are ex officio members. Membership qualifications have also been established, requiring a capital of no less than 500,000 for banks in the city to join. Several preparatory meetings have been held, with the office location temporarily set in the Farmers Bank. The preparatory committee believes that since many banks from Sichuan are coming to Yunnan to set up branches, there is an urgent need for mutual connection. The committee has specially invited the Sichuan, Chongqing, and Meifeng banks, which are about to open, to join the association. The other Sichuan-Kang banks will also be invited to participate after their preparations are completed. The preparatory committee will submit a request to the authorities for registration as soon as preparations are completed. The above is a general overview of the past and present of the financial industry in Kunming. Now, let us talk about the monetary system, which is closely related to finance, which I believe the readers will be happy to hear about.

Yunnan Monetary System: Before the Republic, the paper currency circulating in Yunnan Province included the paper currency of the Daqing Bank. After the establishment of the Republic, there was the paper currency of the Bank of China, both of which were issued by the central government. The paper currency of the Fudian Bank was issued after its establishment in the early years of the Republic. By the 19th year of the Republic, the issuance exceeded the limit, and it was not redeemed. The government established the Fudian New Bank Liquidation Office to handle the liquidation. The total amount issued was more than 92 million yuan, and it was decided several times to exchange and destroy it with new bank notes. A total of more than 52.7 million yuan was destroyed. The unreturned amount is still circulating on the market and is used together with the new bank notes. However, the exchange rate is 5 yuan of old banknotes for 1 yuan of new bank notes. Before the implementation of legal tender, new and old bank notes and cash were used together. Now, with restrictions on the movement of cash, the people generally use paper currency. Now, let me briefly describe the three types of paper currency currently circulating in the market in Yunnan: Fudian New Bank Paper Currency, which is the standard currency of Yunnan Province (commonly known as New Currency), printed by the American Bank Note Company, including five types: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan, which are quite popular. There are also three types of copper coin notes: 10 cents, 20 cents, and 50 cents, printed by the official printing bureau. Because they are mostly tattered, there is very little circulation. At present, the exchange rate between the new currency and the national currency is 1 yuan of new bank notes for 0.5 yuan of legal tender. Old Bank Paper Currency, including six types: 5 jiao, 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan (commonly known as Old Currency). The ones currently circulating on the market are all printed by the American Bank Note Company. As for those printed by the Yunnan Provincial Official Printing Bureau, they have now been collected and destroyed. Every 5 yuan is worth 1 yuan of Fudian New Bank Paper Currency (or 0.5 yuan of legal tender). Central Paper Currency, commonly used are various paper currencies of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, which are the same as those used in Beijing and Shanghai. Yunnan generally refers to them as Central Currency, and they are also very popular. However, the 1 yuan notes and corner notes of the Central Bank are difficult to find, and they have also been circulated in remote prefectures and counties. Each yuan is worth 2 yuan of Fudian New Bank Paper Currency. In addition, there are paper currencies of the Banque de l'Indochine, which are only used for transactions with Vietnam. In the Yunnan market, there are only market prices but no circulation. The same is true for paper currencies of various banks in Hong Kong. (The End)

### Japanese Troops in Danyang Suffer Losses; Chinese Troops Reportedly Recapture Liyang

Danyang Dispatch: The vanguard of the New Fourth Army has reached Shuidong Village in the southeast of Danyang. Two hundred members of the Japanese military police garrison in Danyang City suddenly launched a surprise attack at dawn on the 10th, taking advantage of the Chinese army's unpreparedness. Unexpectedly, the Chinese army had already ambushed in the surrounding mountains. As soon as the gunfire sounded, the ambushing troops rose up from all sides. The Japanese army was unable to cope, trampled on each other, and fled back to Danyang City in a panic. A Japanese regimental commander and four Japanese soldiers were killed on the spot. After retreating, the Japanese army held firm in the city and dared not cross the line again. At the same time, the Chinese army on the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway recovered Liyang County and advanced victoriously towards the Nanjing-Jurong Highway. The entire Jurong-Liyang Highway was also thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese side, making it impossible to drive vehicles.

### Explosion En Route: More Than a Dozen Killed or Injured

Wuxi Dispatch: At around 2:40 p.m. on the 11th, a yellow military truck belonging to the Itaki Unit of the Japanese army stationed in Wuxi, with the license plate number 板字74, was carrying ammunition and other military supplies, escorted by six Japanese soldiers. The truck departed from the headquarters of the Itaki Unit in Sheqiao and was heading towards Yixing. As the truck passed through Tonghui Road and reached the Sancha intersection near the Nantianqiao Bridge in Kaiyuan Road Hexiakou, the truck suddenly exploded. Immediately, flames splashed everywhere, and crackling sounds were heard. The soldiers were immediately on fire, and the engine was also ignited. Seeing the disaster, the Japanese soldiers jumped off the truck and tried to escape. As a result, except for the driver who escaped safely, only two of the six Japanese soldiers survived. The remaining four were injured and failed to escape, so they perished with the truck. When the truck exploded, three villagers, one village woman, and two children happened to be passing by, and they were affected. The woman and two children died on the spot due to their serious injuries. Three villagers, Wu Aben, was injured in the chest, Qin Jinbao was injured in his hands and feet, and Hua Gezi, a native of Yancheng, was injured in the head. Wu and Hua were the most seriously injured. As for the escaped coolies and two Japanese soldiers, their whereabouts are unknown.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Sends Urgent Telegram to the Central Government: Requesting Funds for Disaster Relief and Yellow River Prevention; Construction Director Appeals to Relief Society

Taixian Dispatch: Han Deqin, acting chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in view of the major disaster caused by the southward invasion of the Yellow River, sent a special telegram to the Central Government requesting funds for construction to rescue the hungry and drowning. At the same time, Hu Jiaozhao, director of the Construction Department, also sent a telegram on behalf of the Jiangsu Provincial Relief Branch, appealing for immediate fund-raising to cooperate with the project to protect the river defenses. The two telegrams are recorded separately as follows:

Telegram to the Central Government: To Director Kong of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, Chairman Kong of the Relief Committee, Vice Chairman Xu, and Minister of Economic Affairs Weng: The disaster of the Yellow River invading the south and the flood situation in Jiangsu Province has been reported by telegram several times. We have also submitted a preliminary estimate for repairing the damaged river embankments and silted river channels, requiring 1 million yuan in labor costs. Director Hu of the Construction Department, on November of last year, forwarded the various plans to the Yellow River Disaster Relief Office by telegram, requesting the allocation of funds for work-for-relief, but no reply has been received so far. It is found that the areas of Siyang, Huaiyin, Gaobao, and Binhu have been flooded due to the confluence of the Yellow and Huai rivers, resulting in disaster. The two wheats could not be sown, and cries of despair are everywhere, and grain is difficult to obtain. The spring season is approaching, and the collapsed dikes and damaged embankments of the canal, and the river dredging and dike repair projects in the flooded counties, need to be organized urgently. It is appropriate to hire disaster victims and start construction in a timely manner, which can not only relieve the current famine but also defend against future water threats. It will benefit both at once, and it will be beneficial for stabilizing the rear and enhancing the strength of the War of Resistance. I hereby send a telegram respectfully requesting that you quickly allocate funds so that we can select key areas to implement them, so as to protect the river defenses and rescue the hungry and drowning. I await your urgent order. Han Deqin, Acting Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, kowtows.

Telegram to the Relief Society: To Deputy Director Cheng Jingsheng of the Jiangsu Provincial Relief Branch: The disaster situation in northern Jiangsu has long been clear. With the Yellow River breach unblocked and a major disaster looming, all the collapsed and damaged sections of the canal dikes, and the silted river channels and damaged dikes in the flooded counties, urgently need to be repaired to protect them. You previously visited Huai and discussed work-for-relief and agreed with it. At present, in the areas of Siyang, Huaiyin, Gaobao, and Binhu, the accumulated floodwaters have not receded, the autumn crops have not been harvested, and there is no hope for the two wheats. Cries of despair are everywhere, and grain is difficult to obtain. It is appropriate to summon disaster victims and immediately start various projects, which can not only save the current famine but also defend against future disasters. We plan to formulate a restoration plan for various key projects, requiring approximately 1 million yuan in labor costs. In addition to sending a letter to the Provincial Relief Branch and submitting it to various ministries and departments of the Central Government, please send another telegram to urge and raise funds in various ways to achieve complete success, so that the tens of millions of people in northern Jiangsu can all celebrate the restoration. I have always admired your love for the people. I am sure that you will be happy to help me achieve this. I look forward to your reply by telegram. Hu Jiaozhao.

### Farmers in Suzhou Resist Rent, Causing Unrest with Many Deaths and Injuries

Suzhou Dispatch: Since the establishment of the Consolidated Land Tax Bureau in Wu County, more than 1 million acres of cultivated land have been counted, and there are more than 400,000 tenant farmers. After the incident, people's livelihoods have been particularly devastated, and tenant farmers are unable to pay rent. However, the puppet county government does not care about the people's difficulties and still insists on squeezing them, resulting in rent resistance cases in Wangting, Xietang, and other places. The situation is serious, and has not been resolved until now. Unexpectedly, a tax collection official went to the countryside outside Fengmen to collect taxes harshly. Baojia chiefs Cao Zhaofu and Cao Zijin gathered a crowd, and more than a hundred people gathered with hoes and iron rakes. More than a dozen people were seriously injured on the spot, including nine who were critically injured and three who were slightly injured. Peng Zijia, the puppet collection sub-bureau of Fengmen, reported to the puppet province, and arrested Cao Zijin and others and imprisoned them. The puppet governor Guo Zengji immediately summoned the chiefs of the five districts and ordered them to prevent similar incidents from happening. He also organized a puppet tenant processing office to specifically deal with this matter. At the same time, the villagers in Jiaozhi and Jiabang also burned down the residence of the township head, Yisheng, due to rent resistance. This trend will continue unabated.

### Puppet Government in Fengxian: Qian Chao Appears in the Spotlight

Punan Dispatch: Puppet organizations have been established in the counties in the southeast of Pudong, such as Nanhui, Chuansha, and Jinshan. Only Fengxian County has been unable to proceed with guerrilla activities, which the Japanese puppets greatly regret. Therefore, at all costs, they specially mobilized more than 2,000 naval and land troops to invade Fengxian. On the one hand, they also sent planes to demonstrate in the air. At that time, the Chinese National Salvation Army there happened to be ordered to go to Pinghu and other areas to assist in the battle. There were not many troops left in various places. The disparity between the forces was great, and the Japanese army took this opportunity to drive straight in from three routes: Minhang, Zhoupu, and Songjiang. On the afternoon of the 10th, they concentrated in Nanqiao Town, the county seat. Then the propaganda team came forward and organized the Fengxian puppet government office. The puppet county chief was Qian Chao, formerly a staff officer of the puppet pacification First District Command. Yesterday, under the protection of the Japanese army, he was declared established. At the same time, the puppet police bureau was also taken over by a certain Zhang. In addition to leaving 200 army troops to protect them, all the army troops sent from Zhoupu and the more than 600 navy troops sent from Shanghai were sent back to their defenses by steamboat yesterday afternoon. Therefore, the influence of the puppet government office only extends to Nanqiao Town and its surrounding three li.

### Current Situation in Qingpu: Population Greatly Reduced Compared to Before

Qingpu Dispatch: This county is a commercial and industrial area, with Zhujiajiao as the main town, which is even more of a land of fish and rice. Since the fall, it has been repeatedly recovered and lost by guerrillas. Before the war, the population was more than 20,000, but now it is only more than 4,000. One quarter of them live inside the city, and three quarters live outside the city, with the most living outside the North Gate. The population of Zhujiajiao is now 17,000, half less than before the war. Since the establishment of the puppet county office, the area inside and outside the city has been divided into eight bao, with the first four bao inside the city and the rest outside the city. The fourth bao has the smallest population, only 372 people. The eighth bao outside the city has the largest population, with 742 people. The puppet police bureau has more than 100 puppet police and 30-odd old guns. The Qingpu Joint Fire Brigade is completely empty. Zhujiajiao has a puppet district office and a puppet police sub-bureau. There is a small power plant in Zhenxi. Usually, water transportation can reach everywhere, but now it is guarded by guerrillas. There are five water gates in the city, but now only the North Gate is open. It is also impossible to travel freely by land to the countryside. There is the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway, with cars coming and going once a day. The Qingpu-Songjiang and Qingpu-Anfeng highways have not yet been opened to traffic. The Nanjing-Shanghai Road in Huangdu Township is extremely convenient by both water and land, but due to the special circumstances, it is often blocked. There are 400 to 500 Japanese troops stationed in the city. Japanese troops patrol the highway from time to time, but guerrillas are still very active in the countryside six or seven li from the city. After the destruction in the city, the cost of living is getting higher and higher. The puppet government collects 4 jiao of rice tax per zong and 6 jiao of land tax per mu. Because most of the landlords have not returned, the puppet government forces the farmers to pay. There is also a comfort station in the city with 11 prostitutes, mostly from Yangzhou. Most of the puppet organization personnel are opium and heroin addicts. All kinds of situations are really heartbreaking.

### Finance: Tianjin and Hong Kong Forces Simultaneously Begin Purchasing; Cash Continues to Advance to a High Peak; Reached 2,060 Yuan Before the Evening Close

Yesterday's cash bullion black market continued to rise, because the foreign exchange rate tended to soften slightly under the settlement of purchases by foreign firms, and the Hong Kong and Tianjin forces successively searched for gold. In addition, the wealthy in the city also absorbed a little, and finally relied on the gold shops and silver shops to continue to supply gold, so the resulting increase was still very small. There were few changes in the middle. All parties were stable and transactions were slightly weak. Silver jewelry in silver shops was listed at one yuan higher, and customs gold, Zhongying gold, and pure gold all rose.

### Bullion Black Market Rises by Five Yuan

From the morning, the initial opening for each ten-tael bar of bullion was bought because it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was slightly tight, so it was immediately shouted at 2,056 yuan. However, sellers were willing to supply goods only if they wanted 60 yuan, which caused the two sides to persist until 10:15, when a silver shop was seen to have bought 100 taels from a colleague, and a cash shop bought 50 taels, both at an opening price of 2,056 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than last Saturday. (It was heard that the purchases were made on behalf of the Hong Kong forces), followed by another purchase of 50 taels from a colleague, with a price of 57 yuan. Later, another silver shop also searched for gold on behalf of the wealthy in the city, buying 50 taels from a money exchange shop at the same price. After that, the northern forces also came to buy gold, buying 10 taels from the silver shop at the same price. The price was still 57 yuan. Then, 60 taels were bought from a gold shop, with a price of 58 yuan. At that time, the silver shop was seen to mutually transact 50 taels, with a price of 57.5 yuan. Later, the silver shop bought 50 taels from the gold shop, with a price of 58 yuan. The time was 11:30. After that, the supply and demand turned sparse, and the price also stabilized. Until noon, no transactions were seen, so the noon closing price was still 58 yuan. The afternoon started quite dull, and it was not until 2:15 that the silver shop sold 50 taels to the money exchange shop at a price of 58 yuan. After that, because the money exchange shop was still keen on buying, the price rose slightly again. A money exchange shop bought 50 taels from a colleague, with a price of 60 yuan as the highest peak. Later, the money exchange shop mutually transacted 50 taels, with a price of 59 yuan. The time was already 3:15. After that, the market situation turned dull again, and the price also stabilized. Until 4:00, no transactions were seen, so the evening closing price was still 2,059 yuan, which was 5 yuan higher than the previous day (it has been rising for three consecutive days, totaling 14 yuan), and the range was four yuan for the whole day. The selling price of the cash shop's own-brand gold was 2,070 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,055 yuan. The current bidding price is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, but no transactions have been seen.

### Silver Jewelry Rises by One Yuan Again

The initial selling price of silver jewelry per tael did not change. It was not until 11:15 that the price of bullion was approaching the 60 yuan mark, so it was listed at one yuan higher. Datongxing, Lao Qingyun, and others changed to 209 yuan, and Xin Tonghang changed to 207 yuan, with a purchase price of 201 yuan.

### Central Gold Bidding Follows the Rise by One Yuan

The buying price of Chinese cash by the Central Bank has risen to 1,211.6 yuan. The listed customs gold has also risen by 2 li, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The price of Shanghai standard gold has also risen by one yuan, totaling 1,206.9 yuan, which is said to be due to the sudden increase of British pure gold by 1.5 pence in the London telecommunications on the 11th.

### Foreign Exchange Settlement Remains Strong; Exchange Rates for British, American, and Hong Kong Currencies Continue to Tighten, but the Process is Quite Ordinary

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw bustling settlements by various foreign firms, coupled with successive purchases and settlements by the Banque de l'Indochine. Fortunately, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), Sassoon, and the Hong Kong Electric Company competed to provide supply, keeping the situation from becoming too tight. However, the fluctuations in between remained mediocre, and trading was quite active. The Hong Kong exchange rate softened slightly due to sluggish demand from foreign banks.

In the early morning, the recent London cable rate rebounded to 1875, and the forward rate also rose to 0625. The New York silver price remained unchanged. The London gold price increased by 1.5 pence. The exchange rate between British and American currencies narrowed by 6 cents, and against the French franc, it fell by 7 centimes; it was flat against Shanghai. The rates between the US dollar and British, French, and Shanghai currencies remained unchanged. The central bank's listed rates remained stable. The opening selling prices for banks were 8 pence and 140625 for British gold and 15.90625 yuan for the US dollar, both unchanged from Saturday afternoon's closing prices. After the opening, foreign firms and the Banque de l'Indochine aggressively absorbed currencies. Fortunately, HSBC and Sassoon provided good supply, preventing the situation from becoming too tight. Foreign firms and the Banque de l'Indochine settled with HSBC and Sassoon at 8 pence and 125 for British gold. The announced salt exchange rate remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced at 1.00, calculated at 7.00%. Subsequently, foreign firms purchased US dollars from HSBC, Sassoon, and another bank at 15.875 yuan, resulting in a slight weakening. Approaching noon, trading became thin, with only slight buying and selling of Hong Kong currency. Chinese banks traded Hong Kong currency among themselves at 54.375 yuan with silver dollars, so the underlying trend remained flat. The afternoon closing prices for banks were 8 pence and 125 for the British exchange rate and 15.875 yuan for the US dollar. Later in the afternoon, Hong Kong Electric and Sassoon first came to sell British gold to the Banque Belge pour l'Étranger and the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij at 8 pence and 140625. Subsequently, Hong Kong Electric sold US dollars to a certain bank and the Banque de l'Indochine at 15.90625 yuan. Later, foreign firms again came to settle with HSBC and the Banque Belge for British gold at 8 pence and 125, and they also purchased US dollars from the Banque Belge at 15.875 yuan. Therefore, the process lacked significant changes. Finally, money exchange businesses settled Hong Kong currency with the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij at 54.375 yuan, resulting in a slight softening. By the late closing, bank selling prices were 8 pence and 125 for the British exchange rate and 15.875 yuan for the US dollar.

Later in the day, Hong Kong Electric and Sassoon first came to sell British gold to the Banque Belge pour l'Étranger and the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij at 8 pence and 140625. Subsequently, Hong Kong Electric sold US dollars to a certain bank and the Banque de l'Indochine at 15.90625 yuan. Later, foreign firms again came to settle with HSBC and the Banque Belge for British gold at 8 pence and 125, and they also purchased US dollars from the Banque Belge at 15.875 yuan. Therefore, the process lacked significant changes. Finally, money exchange businesses settled Hong Kong currency with the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij at 54.375 yuan, resulting in a slight softening. By the late closing, bank selling prices were 8 pence and 125 for the British exchange rate and 15.875 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to Saturday afternoon's closing prices, the British rate was down by 015625, the US rate was tight by 03125, and the Hong Kong rate also softened by 125. The day's trading records are listed below.

### Sudden Increase in Demand for French Franc Bills

Last Saturday, British pure gold rose by 1.5 pence. The British-American exchange rate was unchanged. Foreign exchange settlements were very active. The Hong Kong Electric Company's sales were not strong. Banks showed little willingness to sell. Market prices gradually tightened. The Shanghai stock market opened firm. Retail investors continued to absorb. Major players remained on the sidelines. Only the Hong Kong syndicate slightly accumulated. Supply was not smooth. Inventory dried up. Market prices rose. The trend was firm. Fortunately, trading was not strong, and changes were slight. Foreign currencies weakened due to soft bills of exchange. Gold prices rose slightly. British and American gold pounds rose slightly. Foreign banks slightly accumulated American dollar bills and Hong Kong bills. There was a sudden increase in demand for French franc bills. Retail trading was still active. Association trading was also strong. Sen Tai sold six hundred French franc bills to San Tai. Bao Cheng sold ten British gold pounds to Hong Chang. Xiang Tai sold three thousand five hundred French francs to San Tai. Qin Tai sold three thousand French francs to San Tai. Ying Feng sold one thousand Hong Kong dollar bills to Tong Feng. Ding Yuan sold fifty British gold pound bills to Yong Sheng. Yi Kang sold thirty British gold pound bills to Feng Pan. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by two jiao, British gold bills fell by three fen, American gold pounds rose by one jiao, Hong Kong bills rose by one li, French franc bills rose by two li. Most other currencies did not change.

### Slight Rise in Discount Rates

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange was slightly higher, remaining around 35 yuan per thousand. At noon, it was 35 yuan and 2.5 jiao. It was even flatter in the afternoon, slightly higher by 2.5 jiao compared to Saturday.

### Securities: Bond Market in Decline

The informal securities market yesterday reached the end of its last two days. Due to various environmental factors, the trend still felt weak. With the Japanese army landing on Hainan Island, the situation gradually expanded. The French attitude gradually hardened. South China would be plagued with incidents from then on. The public bond market lacked vitality due to the hesitation of major players and the withdrawal of many parties. People were in a daze and felt uneasy. Market prices fluctuated insignificantly. However, there were widespread rumors in the market that sellers were exchanging cash to purchase cotton yarn, which was not uncommon. Therefore, public bonds showed no improvement for the time being. Looking at yesterday's activity, Xie Da continued to sell relentlessly at the opening, while Tong Kang Hao and Tian Xing Hao also sold off, causing the price to fall by another four or five jiao. Subsequently, Xin Feng and Yong continued to buy in, and Lian He Hao also covered short positions, causing the price to rebound by two or three jiao, matching the opening price. In the afternoon, Xie Da continued to sell, but retail investors gradually began to absorb, and the market was able to slightly recover, but failed to escape the consolidation. The most noteworthy players in the recent bull-bear battle were Xin Feng, Yong, and Xie Da. Xin Feng and Yong had been absorbing daily for the past few days, while Xie Da had been selling every day. The two sides were in absolute opposition, and the volume was gradually becoming considerable. The competition between the two sides was fierce in secret, and there would surely be excitement when the market turned bullish. Yesterday's market price results: Type E and Type B were completely unchanged. Type D was the lowest, down by four and a half jiao due to no trading in the afternoon. Type C and Type A were only down by five fen and one jiao. The total turnover was about 600,000 yuan. Today, there was only half a day of trading in the morning before the market closed. A brief table is listed below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Unified A | 53.00 | 52.70 | 52.95 | Down 0.10
Unified B | 48.00 | 47.70 | 48.00 | Flat
Unified C | 46.00 | 45.50 | 46.00 | Down 0.05
Unified E | 44.60 | 44.50 | 44.60 | Down 0.45
Unified D | 45.00 | 44.50 | 45.00 | Flat

In stock trading, only 13 shares of the Commercial Press stock were traded at a price of 66 yuan. In addition, 100 shares of the Great China Match Company stock were traded at a price of 12.7 yuan, and scattered shares were priced at 12.65 yuan. It was heard that the company's interest could be distributed at least at 8%.

### Sugar Market: Newly Arrived National Sugar, 5,600 Bags

The sugar market trend was firm yesterday. The association's listed prices were 24.4 yuan for Dutch-origin coarse white sugar in local warehouses and 24.6 yuan for Da Jin Qian Mark high-grade coarse white sugar. Transit goods were still quoted at the original prices. Dutch red sugar spot was 16.55 yuan, transit goods were 11 yuan, Taikoo Car White B Mark in local warehouses was 24 yuan, with the remaining subject to rebate. In addition, H Mark red sugar spot was 16.55 yuan. The local factory's No. 1 refined white sugar was 24.8 yuan, No. 1 crystal sugar was 32 yuan, and superior block ice sugar was 48 yuan. National Sugar goods were released sporadically, and prices remained unchanged. New shipments arrived, including 4,282 bags of Chaozhou sugar on the Qing Yuan, Ze Sheng, and De Sheng vessels, 853 bags of Guangdong block green sugar, 364 bags of Haikou red sugar, and 100 bags of Beihai white sugar, totaling 5,599 bags.

Silk Industry

### Grabbing Guerrilla Areas: The Scheme of the Cocoon Exchanges

— Sun Guang

(1) Since the Japanese established the so-called "Central China Silk Co., Ltd." last year, they have begun to attack silk factories, silkworm seed farms, and cocoon exchanges in the Central China war zone, implementing their attempt to seize the entire silk industry in the Central China war zone, in order to intensify economic exploitation. Naturally, with the military control of the Japanese side, the fawning of traitors, and the internal and external collusion, the Japanese side was almost invincible. The great achievements of the silk industry of the Republic of China had to become increasingly weak, like a patient. But what is most surprising here is the cleverness and thoroughness of the scheme devised by a group of silk industry practitioners and related personnel for their "masters," and this kind of utter loyalty to "defend Japan," which enabled the very clumsy Japanese to achieve such results in the inland war zone. If it were not for this group of brain-dead scum. The fact is very clear: if the silk factories in Wuxi did not have great figures such as Zhang Zizhen and Qian Fengh, they would not have been reduced to this state. We can prove this by looking at the recent seizure of the cocoon industry in the Jiangzhe area by the "Central China Silk Company."

(2) Originally, to collect cocoons during the cocoon season, one must use cocoon exchanges; and cocoon exchanges generally have cocoon stoves (whether earthen stoves or machine stoves). The location of the cocoon exchanges is mostly in towns and villages where the silk industry is concentrated. The owners of the cocoon exchanges are, of course, residents scattered in various towns and villages. Therefore, if the Japanese want to control the collection of cocoons, they must find a way to recruit each cocoon exchange; they must find the owner of the exchange. If the Japanese directly came forward to negotiate, on the one hand, because everyone is afraid of the Japanese in the current situation, the owners of the cocoon exchanges scattered in various towns and villages are not easy to find. Even if they succeed, because of the burning, killing, raping, and looting of the Japanese, no one with a simple and pure mind in the villages and towns would be willing to cooperate with the Japanese. Even if we take a step back: the Japanese have been able to successfully recruit each cocoon exchange, but because of the geographical nature of the cocoon exchanges scattered in the towns and villages, the Japanese cannot go to the cocoon exchanges to collect cocoons. In other words: even if the owners of the cocoon exchanges are willing to cooperate with the Japanese, because the Japanese forces can only control cities and transportation lines, they are limited in space to the towns and villages, which are mostly controlled by guerrilla forces, and at this time when it is impossible to transfer Japanese soldiers to protect the cocoon exchanges, the Japanese cannot obtain the satisfactory result of collecting cocoons. This point: of course, the Japanese also understand very clearly, so the "Central China Silk Company" used an indirect seizure policy to control the collection of cocoons, thanks to the suggestion of a scoundrel. That is, first find a way to recruit people related to the silk and cocoon industry in various counties in the Central China war zone, give them benefits, and have them come forward to rent the cocoon exchanges in each county, and then secretly transfer them to the "Central China Company." In other words, there is an intermediate puppet between the "Central China Company" and the owners of the cocoon exchanges. In the case of Wu County, it is Huang XX, a former silk and cocoon merchant who has now surrendered to the "Central China Silk Company," who personally came forward to rent the cocoon exchanges, and then Huang transferred them to the Japanese. Although in fact, Huang XX is the "Central China Company," in name, the owners of the cocoon exchanges always think that they are renting to Chinese merchants. And in the towns and villages controlled by the guerrillas, they can of course use the signboard of Chinese merchants as a cover to conceal the truth. In this way, the Japanese attempt to control and seize the cocoon exchanges in the war zone naturally becomes unimpeded due to the relationship of the traitors. According to recent news: more than 250 cocoon exchanges in the Jiangzhe area have been rented by Chinese and recruited by the "Central China Silk Company." This shows the Japanese side's premeditation and the cruelty of the traitors. (To be continued)

### Yarn and Cotton: Hainan Issue, Varying Views on Yarn Prices, Many Retail Investors Eager to Unload, Yesterday's Price Fell First by Five Yuan

The yarn market continued to decline, and the downward trend was indeed strong. Since the Japanese army invaded Hainan Island, people in the industry said that the sea defense transportation line was deeply threatened, and people's confidence was inevitably hit. Retail investors sold off one after another. Moreover, it was the end of the year, and the market only had a few days of business left. To avoid taking risks, they had to close their positions according to the market price. Therefore, the market once appeared weak. The lowest price of 20-count Double Horse yarn reached 391 yuan, which was 7 yuan lower than Saturday's price. As the decline intensified, some bulls with ample financial resources came to collect cheap goods in the market, and the price rebounded by 2 yuan. Other brands also improved slightly. How the future will be is still difficult to predict. Enquiries about the opinions of the public in the market said that there was still no major downward trend. Therefore, the market was soft but flat.

The current yarn situation: the atmosphere at the opening in the early morning was extremely idle. Some people said that there was a problem with yarn prices after the Japanese invasion of Hainan Island, and some people said that the impact was not great. In addition, actual demand was still sluggish, and sales were not smooth. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 3 yuan to 395 yuan. Afterwards, brokers were vigorously selling in the market, but few buyers were interested. The market became increasingly unsustainable, and the pace became slack. The lowest price of 20-count Bianma yarn was 391 yuan, and the warehouse order price was 388 yuan. But after the price fell, a certain merchant came to buy in, but the price had to be cheap. The market atmosphere was supported by it, and the market rebounded at the close. However, turnover was not strong. Only the Tianjin syndicate showed strong interest in 10-count coarse yarn, with more than 300 bales traded. As a result, the morning turnover totaled 953 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 5 yuan, Tejincheng fell by 5 yuan, Double Globe fell by 5 yuan, and Tiannv fell by 5.5 yuan. The price of 20-count coarse yarn was stable due to the active sales market in the north and the weak inventory. Yesterday, 100 pieces were exported to Quanzhou, and 150 pieces of cotton cloth were also shipped to Quanzhou. Today, there are still 200 pieces to be shipped to Yantai and 120 pieces to be shipped to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each syndicate is recorded on the left:

Same Trade: 355, Tianjin: 515, Ningbo: 51, Hong Kong: 30, Inland: 2, Total: 953

The Japanese yarn market was unusually quiet, and all parties were busy closing accounts. Business was completely at a standstill, and market prices were unchanged. The current price of 20-count Water Moon yarn was 328 yuan, and the current price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 322 yuan, with little difference from the previous day.

### No Cotton Available in North China: Yarn Mills in Shanghai Ordering American Cotton; 2,000 Bales Transacted Yesterday

Foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market showed no improvement. Because the cotton industry legislation has not been resolved and the European political situation is unstable, cotton prices have shown a downward trend, mainly because the government will no longer implement loan policies for the new cotton produced this year, and the new cotton will be affected. Yesterday, American cotton fell by 5 to 8 points. Indian cotton, together with forecasts, rose by half a rupee. The Egyptian market was closed. Yesterday, the exchange rate was unchanged. Converting to legal tender, American cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 3 jiao per lot, Egyptian cotton fell by 3 jiao, and Indian cotton rose by 2 jiao.

The foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was very quiet. The Lunar New Year was approaching, and all factories were busy closing their accounts. There was no hope for trading within the year. Yesterday, a certain factory in North China, because the cotton production in that area had been stolen and transported by a certain party, and the factory's cotton reserves were about to run out, planned to purchase foreign cotton in Shanghai and transport it to North China. This newspaper reported on this earlier, but because of payment and delivery issues, discussions have been going on for more than a week. Yesterday, because New York fell by several points, the conversion to legal tender was very cheap, so 2,000 bales of American cotton were ordered yesterday. As for the delivery procedures, because the environment there is special, details cannot be published. The cotton prices of yesterday are recorded below:

Raw Material Category | Category | Delivered to Factory, Including Tax
------- | -------- | --------
60-Count Egyptian Cotton | Superior Grade | 109.80
 | Medium Grade | 106.80
80-Count  | Superior Grade | 134.45
 | Medium Grade | 124.10
20-Count American Middling | 83.30
 | Lower Grade | 70.70
32-Count  | 92.10
 | Lower Grade | 81.60
42-Count  | 93.95
 | Lower Grade | 82.60
 | South American Brazilian Cotton Superior Grade | 88.75
 | Medium Grade | 84.55
 | Lower Grade | 77.85
10-Count Indian  | 61.60
16-Count Indian  | 67.60
20-Count  | 71.70
24-Count Indian  | 77.75
32-Count American  | 83.00
32-Count American  | 87.90
42-Count American  | 87.90

In the festive atmosphere of the Lunar New Year, factories are busy closing their accounts, and the market is completely at a standstill. No transactions have been made. Along the Subei route, only 55 pieces of cotton were transported from Beisha yesterday and today. There are very few sources at the wharf, and everyone is waiting for the Lunar New Year market to determine their direction.

### Grain: Tianjin Syndicate Resumes Trading in Low-Grade Flour; Ends Operations Starting Today

The current flour market trend remains unchanged. Customer syndicates' trading appeared lively because of the weekend. In addition to the sporadic additions from the northern and southern syndicates, the Tianjin syndicate paid attention to low-grade flour, purchasing nearly 10,000 bags of Blue Cannon Cart flour produced by Fufeng Factory at a price of 4.55 yuan. The offer for No. 2 flour from the factory remained at 4.8 yuan, and it is feared that it may remain stable within the year. In the overall market transactions, in addition to a batch of low-grade flour, the northern and southern syndicates jointly purchased more than 10,000 bags of various brands of truck and boat flour, and local retailers purchased 7,000 to 8,000 bags. The market can be considered stable. Also, 55,000 bags of flour were shipped to Quanzhou yesterday, and 5,000 bags will be shipped to Tianjin today. The wheat market was particularly strong yesterday, and the market has ended operations. The stock of wheat is only 3,500 bags, and it is planned to prepare for resale in the Lunar New Year market next year. Fufeng Factory was the first to stop operations, and Fuxin Factory was only responding to a small number of final orders. The market was five fen higher than last week. 700 bags of Jiangbei wheat were traded at a price of 6.7 yuan, all purchased by Fuxin Factory. Starting today, the miscellaneous grain market has ended operations, and we will see the market conditions in the Lunar New Year market next year. However, according to observers in the industry, the flour market next year may be weak due to the dumping of foreign flour and wheat.

### Rice Market Ends: More Than 2 Million Bags of Rice in Stock; Customer Rice Sales are Still Good

The domestic rice market was the last day before closing yesterday. There were no sources from any syndicate. Only the sellers slightly sold off the goods in hand. Sales were only slightly added by local retailers. The market was unchanged. The price of thick japonica rice remained the same. Thin early rice was also stable. Only the He Xia goods slightly rebounded because they fell sharply yesterday. The sales of Du Yang Jian Bu Jian rice are fair and square, and the changes are also keeping the original position. The rice market has already ended. However, the stock of goods in warehouses and shops in Shanghai is more than 2 million bags. With such a rich stock, there is no need to worry about the food supply in Shanghai for a while. However, in the past, Japanese merchants often searched and purchased in the mainland, which had a great impact on the source of supply. I wonder if there will be a long-term strategy after the Lunar New Year market opens on the sixth day of the first lunar month next spring.

Customer rice was inquired about by dealers and customers yesterday, and the market became tighter. The high-priced goods in the general market continued to increase by several fen. A total of 2,700 bags were traded in the whole day. The highest price of Wuhu rice was 10.09 yuan. The general market price was 10.056 yuan to 10.035 yuan. Zhenjiang rice was 11.1 yuan. Nanjing rice did not open. The high-priced goods were still priced at 11.4 yuan. The floating stock in the market has been mostly sold out, and the prices in the production area are high, and it is difficult to make a profit from transportation. However, the total stock of various types of rice in Wuhu and Nanjing is about 200,000 bags. Foreign rice is rarely imported and exported. It has been lacking for a long time. The stock in the city is still about 30,000 bags.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Few in Stock; Only 160,000 Bags, Less Than One-Tenth of Previous Years

The miscellaneous grain market has all ended yesterday. Now, let's investigate and list the number of remaining stock below:

Goods | Number of Bags
------- | --------
Chongming Yellow Soybeans | 25,000 Bags
Chongming Red Beans | 12,000 Bags
Chongming Broad Beans | 25,000 Bags

Jiading Broad Beans | 300 Bags
Nanjing Yellow Soybeans | 1,500 Bags
Bengbu Yellow Soybeans | 500 Bags
Pudong  Beans | 300 Bags
Pinghu  Beans | 1,300 Bags

Qinhuangdao Raw Peanuts | 2,000 Bags
Various Peanuts | 5,000 Bags
Nanjing Rice | 200,000 Bags
Wuhu Rice | 200,000 Bags

The total number of bags in the above table is only slightly more than 160,000 bags (excluding rice). In previous years, it would have been ten times this number.

Today, 500 bags each of soybean cake and bran will be shipped to Yantai.

### Oil Cakes: Stocks of Cake and Oil Are Both Low

The scarcity of stock of oil cakes and oil is unprecedented, mainly because both buyers and sellers are acting cautiously, so the stock of goods at the end of the year is even scarcer. Now, let's list the stock of oil cakes and oil:

Goods | Units | Amount
------- | -------- | --------
Dalian Soybean Oil | Barrels | 3,000 Barrels
 | Large Baskets | 2,000 Pieces
 | Small Baskets | 1,000 Pieces
Yantai Soybean Oil | 1,500 Pieces
Jiaozhou Seed Oil | 200 Pieces
 | Raw Oil | 5,000 Pieces
Dalian  | 3,000 Cans
Qingdao  | 4,000 Cans
Four Brand Soybean Cakes | 30,000 Pieces
Five Brand  | 3,000 Pieces
Sea Brand  | 6,000 Pieces
Jiangbei Small  | 200,000 Pieces

Yesterday, 500 pieces of raw oil came from Yantai, and 1,100 pieces were shipped to Quanzhou.

### North and South Goods: Longan Production Prices Rise

According to a letter from Quanzhou yesterday, because small boat gangs are still purchasing, the production price has risen again by one or two yuan. In the past, market prices before the big closure were cheaper, but this is now different. News from Tong'an, Anhai, and Zhangzhou also shows upward trends, and dried longan pulp is even more firm.

### Silk and Tea: Sales of Indian Silk Stop Temporarily

Also due to the tension in Hainan Island

Yesterday, the New York market was closed. The Yokohama market was firm, with spot prices at 932.50 yuan, near-term prices at 924 yuan, and forward prices at 908 yuan, slightly higher than the end of last week. The silk market in Shanghai has seen a significant decrease in domestic and foreign transactions due to the approaching end of the year and the still high silk prices. Moreover, because foreign firms' offering prices do not match the Shanghai market and sales to India have been temporarily suspended due to the increasing tension in Hainan Island. Observing the market situation, it is expected to maintain its superior prices to safely pass the end of the year.

### Imports and Exports: Goods Arriving and Leaving in the Past Two Days

Yesterday, 300 bags of sugar came from Shantou, 37 pieces of woollen yarn, and 379 pieces of jujubes and walnuts came from Tianjin.

Today, 2,300 pieces of native paper will be shipped to Tianjin, 600 pieces to Yantai, and 400 cans of tung oil to Tianjin.

### Japan Purchasing in Large Quantities: Cotton and Steel Ingots, All Military Materials Shipped by Italian Vessels

Indian cotton is constantly being shipped in, all purchased by Japanese merchants. Another batch arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (11th), totaling 7,000 pieces, shipped from Karachi, India, by the Italian vessel Volpi. Another 3,360 pieces and 251.5 tons of steel ingots were shipped to Japan yesterday on the same vessel. This time, in addition to shipping a large quantity of cotton, the vessel also transported 400 boxes of calcium carbide powder, more than 750 pieces of foreign paper, 160 boxes of turpentine (for paint), and 856 boxes of rubber from Saigon. According to a letter from Quanzhou yesterday, because small boat gangs are still purchasing, the production price of longan has risen again by one or two yuan. In the past, market prices before the big closure were cheaper, but this is now different. News from Tong'an, Anhai, and Tanzhou also shows upward trends, and dried longan pulp is even more firm.

### Seafood: Stocks of Dried Shrimp Are Insufficient

The previous market for dried shrimp sold very well, resulting in a daily decline in the stock of goods, and the source of supply was unsustainable. Therefore, there is a significant shortage of both Zheng Zhoushan goods and Shandong goods in the market. Although trading has slowed down recently, those with goods on hand are all optimistic, because the price per tan (approximately 60 kg) will likely rise by three to four yuan after the Lunar New Year market opens, which is not surprising.

### Hardware: Yuan Bian Ding; Tianjin Sales Booming

Yuan Bian Ding's business had always been greatest in the three northeastern provinces. Since the Northeast was occupied, the transportation of goods has been controlled by the Japanese, making it impossible to transport them there. This caused the market in this port to decline. Recently, business from Tianjin has been booming. Although the year is coming to an end, sales are still thriving. It is estimated that two or three hundred boxes were shipped out yesterday and the day before. Due to weak inventory and no new goods arriving, market prices are high. For example, three-point sizes sell for 85 yuan per box, four-point for 82 yuan, five-point for 81 yuan, and six-point for 78 yuan, all three to four yuan higher than previous market prices. Moreover, transactions in this street have been quite smooth recently, so there may be another price increase in the near future.

### Chaojin Hook Prices Vary

Chaojin hooks have seen good trading activity recently, but all require cash transactions. However, the quality of the hooks varies greatly, so the selling prices also differ. For example, recent market prices range from 98 yuan to 94 or 95 yuan, while discounted prices range from 85 yuan to 83 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Winter Melon Seeds Near Steady

Winter melon seeds produced in Jiangsu Province are large and fleshy, selling for 70 yuan per dan (unit of weight) in the market. The discounted price is for Shantou goods, priced at 45 to 50 yuan. Traders from all over come to this street to purchase them. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, trading has become quiet, and the market price has not changed significantly.

### Seven-Foot Dongbai Iron Sheet: Speculators Aggressively Accumulate, Market Prices Rise

Dongbai iron sheets have been in decline since the factory aggressively pushed out inventory. Recently, seven-foot sheets have risen in price due to aggressive accumulation by speculators and strong actual sales, resulting in insufficient supply. Yesterday's market price was 2.94 yuan per sheet, up 5 to 6 fen from the previous price. The factory is unwilling to release more, resulting in very little circulation. As for six-foot sheets, the market remained sluggish yesterday, with each sheet still priced at around 2.3 yuan. Trading is weak due to slow sales, and morale is low, so the trend is unlikely to be optimistic.

### Coal: Shanxi White Coal; Slight Inventory Release; No New Goods Arrived in Shanghai

Shanxi white coal has been out of stock in the market since the Shanghai war due to transportation disruptions. However, recently a large company has been acting as an agent for the sale of this commodity. To clarify the situation, a reporter inquired in the market and learned that the goods are actually pre-war inventory, stored in various warehouses in Pudong, including the Hanyang Warehouse. They have recently been trying to release them gradually. Among traders, screened lump coal is priced at 45 yuan per ton, and run-of-mine coal at 43 yuan. All are last year's inventory, and no new goods have arrived in port.

### Gao Wei Bituminous Coal: Suddenly Transported to Shanghai for Sale

A foreign firm recently released a portion of Gao Wei bituminous coal, entrusting an agent to market it in Shanghai. The trading price is 36 yuan per ton for run-of-mine coal, 28 yuan for screened lump coal, and 30 yuan for coal dust, totaling 1,600 to 1,700 tons. The goods are available from a warehouse in Pudong, and the handling costs are the responsibility of the buyer.

### My Opinions on Reforming Secondary Education

—Fu Shaoji

The Ministry of Education will convene the Third National Education Conference in Chongqing in March of this year to discuss the implementation plan for education during the extraordinary period. Shen Bao has formulated measures for soliciting articles to facilitate the Shanghai education community in expressing its opinions on education reform during this extraordinary period for reference by the National Education Conference, which I very much agree with. Now, I would like to offer some opinions on secondary education for reference during the conference.

(1) Combining the current junior and senior high school systems into a five-year secondary school. When I attended the "Committee for Compiling and Editing the Teaching Progress of Various Subjects in Secondary Schools" of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education in May of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, I reviewed the outline of the secondary school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry and the textbooks of various subjects that had been approved. I immediately felt that there were some overlaps in the current textbooks for junior and senior high schools in our country. For example, junior high school textbooks teach Chinese history and world history, and senior high school also teaches these subjects. Another example is that junior high school teaches physics and chemistry, and senior high school also teaches these subjects. Although the depth of the courses is different, there are many overlaps. If we revise the current six-year curriculum of junior and senior high schools and teach it completely in five years, it is actually possible. First, during this extraordinary period, the national economy is extremely difficult, and the national economy is also very difficult. The economy of people in the occupied areas is extremely difficult. Even after the war ends, the economy may not be able to recover temporarily. If their children studying in secondary schools can graduate one year earlier, the burden can be lighter. Furthermore, if the war is extended for several more years, the country will urgently need talents. Young people studying in secondary schools can graduate one year earlier, and they can serve the country one year earlier. For these reasons, I advocate combining the current junior and senior high schools and changing them to a five-year secondary school. The Ministry of Education originally had a plan for reform and designated nine secondary schools to conduct pilot programs in April of the 26th year of the Republic of China. Later, the "July 7th" incident caused the pilot program to be suspended indefinitely. This National Education Conference seems to have a need to discuss this matter. As for the organizational outline and curriculum standards of the five-year secondary school, the Ministry of Education should invite experts to revise them in detail and promulgate them for implementation as soon as possible.

(2) Implementing the balanced development of moral, intellectual, physical, and social education. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education stated in an article "Education after the War of Resistance" (published in the Shanghai Sino-US Daily, December 9th of the 27th year of the Republic of China): "Since the advocacy of so-called new-style education, the general trend has been to emphasize intellectual education. So-called education is almost entirely limited to the transmission of knowledge from books, causing the youth of our country who have received education to lack healthy physical standards and have almost no knowledge of the meaning of life and the meaning of morality... To correct this painful phenomenon, the Ministry of Education has specifically set the principle of balanced development of the three educations, striving to ensure that the youth of our country, in addition to having rich knowledge, must also have a sound body and mind to be called complete people." I greatly admire these words. However, I still have one word to say, that is, the youth of our country today, in addition to having rich knowledge, a sound body, and good morality, must also have refined talents and the ability to handle affairs in order to adapt to the needs of the country. A young person who desires to serve the masses and serve the country must advance in the four aspects of physical fitness, learning, character, and talent at the same time. Otherwise, if only the training of the first three is emphasized, then their talents will be clumsy and they will never be able to do something for the masses, or even become a bookworm and follow in the footsteps of scholars in the past. Therefore, I believe that the training of young people today must emphasize the four aspects of physical, intellectual, moral, and social education in order to make them complete people. Furthermore, the connotation of education originally includes six types of education: physical, intellectual, moral, social, political, and aesthetic education (see the resolutions of the National Education Conference convened by the University Council in the 17th year of the Republic of China). Today, although the concept of beauty can be cultivated in moral education, the ability to handle affairs cannot be cultivated in physical, intellectual, and moral education. Moreover, political training can only be included in social education to be effective. Therefore, although political and aesthetic education do not need special emphasis, social education must be specially emphasized. In other words, social education must be balanced with physical, intellectual, and moral education. As for its implementation methods, the Ministry of Education should organize a four-education committee to formulate specific plans and promulgate them for implementation.

(3) Vigorously implement the integrated teaching and guidance system. Guidance is the most difficult problem to solve in today's secondary education. Its scope is the broadest, and all three educations, physical, intellectual, and moral, or the three educations, social, political, and aesthetic, can be included in the scope of guidance. It is most closely related to moral and social education. If we want to solve this problem, we must ask all teachers in the school to assume the responsibility of guidance. Whenever students make a mistake in their words or actions, they should be corrected. This should be done in the classroom and outdoors, so that students' thoughts and behaviors can be brought into the right track and they can become complete people. However, in general secondary schools today, the education of students often focuses on the transmission of knowledge and skills, which is the responsibility of the academic affairs office, while the guidance of thoughts and behaviors is the responsibility of the guidance office. Teaching is done by the academic affairs office, and guidance is done by the guidance office. The guidance personnel are limited, and they cannot see and hear everything. As a result, students' thoughts and behaviors often cause unexpected things due to the lack of guidance on weekdays, so that the academic atmosphere is deteriorating day by day, and students often become troublemakers in society after graduation. The reason why there are so many traitors today can be said to be the result of past education emphasizing teaching but not guidance. Although secondary schools in Jiangsu Province, Shanghai City, and other places have now advocated the "integrated teaching and guidance" system, its organization is only to change the director of academic affairs to the director of teaching and guidance, and then set up class teachers, which is equivalent to adding a few more guidance counselors. Most of the remaining teachers still do not bear the responsibility of guidance, so that guidance has not yet received satisfactory results. Therefore, I say that today's secondary schools, if they want to solve the problem of guidance, must thoroughly implement the "integrated teaching and guidance" system. Not only must the organization of guidance be changed and class teachers be added, but also the remaining teachers (i.e., all teachers) must bear the responsibility of guidance. However, there is one problem, that is, teachers should be full-time and live on campus. On the one hand, the Ministry of Education must expressly stipulate that all teachers must bear the responsibility of guidance, and on the other hand, it must improve their treatment so that they do not go out to teach at other schools or hold other jobs. Today's secondary schools should require all teachers to bear the responsibility of guidance. This resolution seems to need to be discussed at the conference. There are many aspects that need to be improved in secondary schools today. In addition to the above, such as carefully hiring heads of departments, improving the treatment of faculty and staff, emphasizing natural science experiments, and providing scholarships to poor students in the war zones, are also important. I deeply hope that the participants of the National Education Conference will all discuss the above issues so that they can be resolved satisfactorily. (End)

School Overview

### Shenzhou Vocational Night School

Shenzhou Vocational Night School is one of the member schools of the Shanghai Municipal Tutorial Education Association. Although it has only been open for two semesters, it has gained considerable social reputation. The number of students last semester reached 567, and the number of courses exceeded 4,400. The school is able to take care of the interests of students in every way, so students also deeply cherish the school, which has led to today's achievements. The purpose of Shenzhou's founding is to enable young people who are unable to afford to study to have the opportunity to study, so the tuition is extremely low. In addition to homework, it also pays attention to students' spiritual cultivation and behavioral training. Its organization is as follows: (1) Secondary School Department: The curriculum follows the standards prescribed by the Ministry. Senior high school is divided into general and commercial departments. Junior high school adds commercial application subjects as appropriate. Tuition is 9 yuan for senior high school and 7 yuan for junior high school. (2) Elective Courses: Divided into language, vocational, and science/mathematics departments, with levels ranging from senior elementary school to university. Both men and women are accepted. Tuition is from 1 yuan per semester per subject. (3) Women's Class: Classes are held from 3:30 p.m. every day, divided into junior, intermediate, and senior grades. Tuition is 3 yuan for junior grade, 4 yuan for intermediate grade, and 5 yuan for senior grade. (4) Academic Lectures: The subjects are temporarily set up in six lecture series: (A) Social Problems, (B) Economics, (C) Political Science, (D) Philosophy, (E) Literature, (F) Drama. Each lecture series is divided into two stages. The first stage focuses on theory, and the second stage focuses on application. All lecturers are first-class scholars, with Mei Yi, the former chief writer of the China-America Weekly, serving as director. Tuition is only 2 yuan per lecture series. The school's expenses are difficult to offset by tuition income due to the low tuition fees. The shortfall is entirely subsidized by the school board. Last semester, the school divided classes into two campuses due to the large number of students. For the convenience of management, it has found a new campus at No. 540 Ningbo Road (west end of Zhejiang Road), expanding the enrollment to 4,000 students. The number of people signing up for this semester is even more enthusiastic, and it is expected that the number of students will be greatly increased compared to last semester.

### Pure Paramount Team to Face Washington University; Hiring Help Already Ruled Out

The selection of opponents for the Washington University basketball team in this port has been decided to be the pure Paramount basketball team after being approved by the highest authorities in the United States. It is said that when the Washington University basketball team was still in the United States, it contacted Mr. Lu Qiyin, the cousin of Lu Zhongen, the Chinese consul in Seattle, and Mr. Lu introduced the Washington University team to the basketball team affiliated with Lu Zhongen for a friendly game of a goodwill nature. The team carried a handwritten letter from Mr. Lu, so this game is purely friendly in nature. Lu Zhongen is affiliated with Paramount and decided to send a pure Paramount team to face the challenge without inviting other players to join. It is reported that Zhanghua Woolen Mill has donated a silver cup to be given to the winning team. Furthermore, the entire team of the Paramount basketball team is scheduled to practice at the YMCA tonight at 7:30 p.m., and will also practice at the YMCA on Thursday.

### Discussion on the Issue of Universal Vaccination

— Song Guobin

(I)

For several years, the authorities of the two concessions have vigorously promoted hygiene and worked hard on epidemic prevention. Every summer, one can see large vehicles parked on the streets, with six or seven medical staff inside, going in and out, lecturing people and persuading them to get vaccinated. Those who did not listen were forced to do so. Subsequently, the Chinese health authorities also rose up and imitated this practice. The number of vaccinations administered over the years is unknown. Now, whether traveling within the occupied areas or outside the country, one cannot pass without a certificate of vaccination. It is often said that the recent sharp reduction in cholera is due to this. However, this is the opinion of public health scholars. The attitude of clinical physicians is very different. Here, I will list the opinions of the two factions for consideration. Different opinions arise from different perspectives.

(II)

Clinical physicians say: "The target of medical practitioners is the patient. The first principle for a patient seeking treatment from me is to do no harm to their health. Experience tells us that vaccination is not absolutely without contraindications. Those with fever are not suitable for vaccination. Those suspected of having an acute illness are not suitable for vaccination. Likewise, those suffering from progressive tuberculosis, myocarditis, nephritis with proteinuria, hematuria, diabetes, stomach ulcers, and the elderly and infirm are not suitable for vaccination. This is because these patients may experience strong reactions after vaccination, which may worsen their underlying condition, even leading to death. Among the millions of people universally vaccinated, are there not some who are sacrificed? Although there are no statistics, such cases are sometimes heard of. Therefore, if a doctor encounters such a patient requesting vaccination, he should frankly tell them the reason why they cannot be vaccinated or issue a certificate stating that they cannot be vaccinated. If one does not first conduct an examination and universally vaccinates like a roadside doctor, or if one is forced by 'regulations' and knowingly vaccinates when it is not advisable, then one is simply setting up people to be harmed. As the ancients said, 'A benevolent person would not kill one innocent person to benefit the whole world.' Medicine is a benevolent art, so how can one sacrifice the current patient under the guise of assisting public health? Therefore, vaccination should only be performed by a physician. Vaccination on the roadside is not permissible. A physician must first conduct an examination. Blind vaccination is not permissible."

(III)

Public health officials say: "I have a distinction between the large and the small, and a difference between the light and the heavy. The public is large, the individual is small. An epidemic is a great harm, an individual sacrifice is a small harm. Universal vaccination may not be without harm to the aforementioned patients, but by sacrificing a few individuals, many members of the public are saved. Is it better for one family to cry than for an entire road to cry? When weighing the two evils, one should choose the lesser. An individual's life is only a drop in the bucket compared to the great principle of public welfare. The current trend is that the minority obeys the majority, and reason cannot defeat power. This principle applies not only to medical matters but to everything. Therefore, there are those who sacrifice weak nations for the sake of collective security. There are those who restrict individual freedom for the sake of public safety. Medical and health affairs are just one aspect of this. Now, if we were to care for this small number of patients and not implement universal vaccination, then once an epidemic breaks out, even those who escape the net could still be affected. This is not a way to address the root cause and actively prevent epidemics. Moreover, epidemics are more devastating than a wildfire, and epidemic prevention is more urgent than putting out a fire. How can we leisurely and unhurriedly conduct examinations one by one before vaccinating? This is why vaccination must be universalized."

(IV)

In summary, when observing the reasons held by the two factions, both hold their positions with cause and reason. I have no bias towards either side and lack a comprehensive solution. I believe that the interests of the public must be resolved by the public. Therefore, I dare to submit this matter to public debate. Whether it is beneficial or harmful will be determined by public opinion. What to do and where to go will depend on public opinion. I believe this is something that those who are concerned about this issue will be happy to discuss.

Popular Medical Talk

### Scorched Earth Tactics in Epidemiology (Part 1)

— Jiang Zhenxun

The term "scorched earth" has been used since ancient times to describe resistance to foreign invasion. Because epidemic transmission is no less than a serious and terrifying foreign invasion in human life, this article also uses the term "scorched earth" as its theme. In fact, the science of hygiene studied by medical scientists is about the path of scorched earth for the entire life, not only referring to the prevention of infectious diseases. However, due to space limitations, it is not possible to present the entire science of hygiene in accordance with the two goals of scorched earth in its entirety. Therefore, I will only present some contributions from the perspective of preventing infectious diseases. Moreover, even just discussing infectious diseases feels vast and boundless, and it is impossible to fully convey everything in a few words. Now, I can only limit myself to acute infectious diseases, that is, to say some essentials about what everyone considers epidemics.

Speaking of scorched earth, the first thing to do is to define "wall" and "field". From a physiological point of view, the individual life should be taken as the basis. Therefore, from the skin to the blood in the blood vessels, everything should be considered the "wall". From the close-fitting clothing and the air, food and drink that enter the mouth and nose, to everything contained in the natural world, a village, a town, a city, everything should be considered the "field". In this way, hoping that such a thick wall will be strong and that such a wide field will be clean is indeed a very complex and difficult problem to solve thoroughly. Let's first cite some simple examples. Isn't it common knowledge that skin trauma, colds, and flu are the most common physical foreign invasions in life? Then, to hope that the skin is not easily injured and that one is not prone to catching colds all year round, the first thing to do is to make the skin thick and strong enough to withstand all external forces. Second, the climate should be adjusted so that there are no excessively hot or cold changes. However, thickening the skin and adjusting the temperature are already very difficult tasks. Even if the skin is thickened and the temperature is adjusted, the question of whether we can avoid injuries and colds remains. Based on facts, aren't the hands of blacksmiths and carpenters considered to have the thickest skin? However, the instances of blacksmiths and carpenters getting injured are still the most frequent with their hands. In addition, modern material equipment has indeed progressed to the extreme. Isn't the use of hot air in winter and cold air in summer considered a thorough adjustment? However, many people who enter and exit air-conditioned rooms still suffer from colds. What is the reason for this? In fact, to sum it up in one sentence, it is simply because human power cannot overcome nature. Because the skin of blacksmiths and carpenters, although thick, is not as dense as the leather of cattle and horses. Although the temperature inside the house is adjusted to a suitable and ideal living environment, the outdoor climate is still affected by the natural world and cannot be remedied. Therefore, relying on the scorched earth method to prevent injuries and relying on the scorched earth method to prevent colds are still difficult to achieve thoroughly today. This is just one of the simplest examples. As for everything else, it is the same. Therefore, although the entire issue of hygiene has been diligently researched by many experts around the world, we still feel that human power cannot overcome nature.

Common Knowledge of Diseases

### Smallpox in Current Circulation (Continued)

— Nie Chuanxian

(4) Prevention of Smallpox: In dealing with infectious diseases, we usually use either passive isolation or active prevention. Active prevention is more meaningful. The only effective prevention for smallpox is the well-known vaccination method. This was invented by the British scholar Jenner in 1798. The principle is to use vaccination to create an antibody in the body to resist smallpox infection, which is called immunity. The duration of immunity after vaccination is usually five years. However, there is no set rule, and it often varies from person to person. Therefore, it is best to get revaccinated every one or two years, or at least every five years. If there is a smallpox epidemic or contact with a patient, one should get vaccinated immediately. Here, I will briefly describe the points to pay attention to when getting vaccinated. 1. The vaccine should not accidentally enter the eye. Because the conjunctiva can also develop smallpox, it can cause blindness. This should be especially noted in children. Be careful to prevent children from touching the pox with their fingers and indirectly getting it into their eyes. 2. The purpose of vaccination is to prevent smallpox only. It cannot prevent other diseases. Even chickenpox has nothing to do with it, and it does not have other effects on the body. 3. Vaccination is not limited to any season. Because smallpox can be found in all seasons, one cannot wait for the coming spring to get vaccinated during a smallpox epidemic. 4. Infants have temporary immunity to smallpox after birth (i.e., congenital immunity). However, the period is very short, some say two or three months, some say two or three weeks. Therefore, infants should be vaccinated two or three months after birth during normal times, and eight or nine days after birth during a smallpox epidemic. 5. If a pregnant woman contracts smallpox, the fetus is often infected at the same time in the womb, or even miscarries as a result. Therefore, pregnant women should also be vaccinated during a smallpox epidemic to ensure the safety of both mother and child. 6. The ability to be fully immune only begins to develop eleven days after vaccination, and the incubation period of smallpox is about twelve to fourteen days. Therefore, during a smallpox epidemic, it is common for people to contract smallpox soon after vaccination. This does not mean that vaccination is ineffective, but rather that they were already infected with smallpox before vaccination. Although this is rare, the symptoms are still milder than those who have not been vaccinated. 7. In those who have recently recovered from other infectious diseases, such as measles and whooping cough, the vaccination is often difficult to take. This is called no sensitivity. If we encounter this case, we should still get vaccinated again one or two months after the vaccination in order to be safe. 8. If there is smallpox in the neighborhood or among those who live with a patient, the patient should be vaccinated immediately if their body temperature is not too high, and pay attention to isolation from the outside world to prevent the patient from contracting smallpox again. 9. In addition to cowpox vaccine, there are also unhygienic methods such as "nasal vaccine and direct inoculation". This should be advised against and replaced with the current method. Because nasal vaccine can often cause true systemic smallpox, and direct inoculation is very easy to transmit other diseases. In particular, if there are cases of inoculation with syphilis, it is even more likely to develop a hard chancre at the inoculation site. (The end)

### The Science of Chinese Medicine (Continued)

— Zhou Mengbai

First, Diaphoretic and Antipyretic Agents

(1) Artemisia Capillaris

Morphology: This product is the whole plant of white artemisia collected and dried during the fruiting period in August and September. The plant is a perennial herb that grows naturally in sandy and gravelly areas such as mountains, fields, riverbanks, and seashores. The stems can reach up to one meter in height. The leaves emerge from the roots, divided into a pinnate shape, with even finer divisions on the leaves and white hairs. In early summer, small green head-shaped flowers in a racemose inflorescence grow on the top.

Taste and Taboos: It has a peculiar fragrant and bitter taste, so-called bitter, spicy, and slightly cold. Avoid fire and heat.

Quality: The stems with thin leaves that are collected and dried in the shade to become blue are called mian yin chen, which is the top grade; commercially available products are made with its fruit, mostly without mixed stems and leaves, which is the lower grade.

Ingredients: The whole plant contains volatile oil, whose components are B-pinene, capilen C6H6-C7H9ketone C13H14O, etc. The fruit contains more dimethylascutin.

Pharmacology: When the water extract of this product is injected into dogs, it promotes the secretion of bile and inhibits the movement of the intestinal tract. Dimethylascutin, extracted from its fruit, also exhibits the same pharmacological effects as the water extract (according to the experiments of Tang Yonggao and Yano).

Efficacy: It is a diaphoretic, antipyretic, diuretic, and blood-purifying medicine. In ancient prescriptions, it was an essential medicine for jaundice and also has an anthelmintic effect. The daily dose is 8 to 15 grams, made into a decoction. Ictmine, produced by Sankyo in Japan, is the effective ingredient of Artemisia capillaris, which is a choleretic agent used for liver and biliary tract diseases, as well as edema and ascites. The ancient prescription Artemisia capillaris decoction is: Artemisia capillaris 18 grams, gardenia 6 grams, rhubarb 2 grams, water 600 grams, made into a decoction of 200 grams; taken three times a day cold, for jaundice.

### Ministry of Finance, Following Chairman Jiang's Order, Issues Proclamation to Protect Escorted Salt; Matters Concerning Food Supply for the Rear and National Tax Revenue; Prohibiting Seizure, Impoundment of Ships, Vehicles, and Forced Labor

The Ministry of Finance, recognizing that salt is crucial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and is especially important during extraordinary times as it relates to military supplies, has determined that there must be sufficient reserves of salt in various regions. Ordinarily, salt distribution is handled through production, transportation, and sales by merchants, who often do not store large quantities of salt to conserve capital. Therefore, since 1936, the Ministry has been actively directing coastal production areas to transfer and store large quantities of salt from the salt farms and fields to the interior as ordinary food salt. After the start of the war, the Ministry has assessed the demand for salt in various regions, prioritized urgent needs, and actively transported and promoted sales, not allowing the lack of transportation to hinder progress. The supply and demand of salt in various regions have been properly coordinated at all times, preventing salt shortages. Recently, unscrupulous individuals and undisciplined troops have been seizing and impounding salt transport ships and arbitrarily conscripting salt transport laborers, greatly affecting the rush transportation efforts. Following an order from Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Finance is issuing a proclamation to all military organs and troops, prohibiting the seizure and conscription of salt transport ships and laborers, stating: "The item of salt is of great importance to the food supply in the rear and to national tax revenue. Salt patrols should be supported. All vehicles transporting salt, whether loaded or unloaded, shall not be commandeered. Ships transporting salt, whether loaded or unloaded, shall not be impounded. Laborers transporting salt, whether employed or unemployed, shall not be conscripted. In addition to directing all military organs and troops to comply, this proclamation is hereby issued. All military organs and units must comply without fail. This is a proclamation."

### Bean and Rice Industry Responsible for Storing Food; Carefully Stipulating Maximum Prices; Reserves Sufficient to Sustain for Three Months

Since being ordered to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association has not only directed the market to make every effort to stabilize prices but has also encouraged traders to store sufficient food reserves. At the same time, it is working to comply with the government's regulations for food regulation during extraordinary times, allocating resources to store several months' worth of food needed based on Shanghai's population ratio. In key food markets, it is carefully stipulating that the maximum price of food should not exceed fourteen yuan to prevent general monopoly and manipulation. The market has been closed from the 14th and will reopen on February 23rd. On the 15th and 16th, the association will handle the transfer procedures between traders. National rice produced in war zones has been controlled by the Japanese puppet regime. Those who purchase from war zones, such as Changshu, must pay a so-called "removal tax" of a certain amount per bag. Because Japanese merchants and merchants from the north and south are directly purchasing from production areas, reserves in the production areas are depleted, and prices are rising. Rice purchased by Japanese merchants is directly loaded onto Japanese ships for export and is not taxed. However, rice purchased by the southern Shantou merchants is reported to customs for import after arriving in Shantou. Recently, the direct export of rice from production areas has become even more rampant than before. However, the food supply for Shanghai residents is sufficient because of ample reserves, totaling 650,000 bags, each bag containing 1.25 shi, enough to sustain the population for three months. However, the price of rice is affected by Japanese control and direct purchasing. The price of the top-grade rice has already risen to 13.2 yuan.

### Sand and Gravel Industry Unrest Spreads; Disruption of Unloading; Workers Fang Jinxiang and Two Others Arrested; Association Sends Letter to Sijiao Guerrilla Team Requesting Justice

After the sand and gravel industry protested against the use of special powers to monopolize the transport of sand and gravel to Shanghai, leading to a strike by sand and gravel workers, the striking workers yesterday disrupted the unloading of goods by Wantai, and workers Fang Jinxiang and two others were arrested. The association has proceeded with bail and has sent a letter to the Sijiao guerrilla team requesting justice. The details are as follows:

Disruption of Unloading: After Wantai Company monopolized the transport of Sijiao sand and gravel to Shanghai, striking workers had previously disrupted Wantai's unloading at the New Garbage Bridge. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, Wantai hired forty to fifty new workers at the Taikoo Wharf and attempted to forcibly unload the goods at the New Garbage Bridge. Over seven hundred striking workers gathered and rushed to stop them, leading to a disruption. Workers Fang Jinxiang and two others were arrested by the police and taken to the Avenue Edward VII Police Station. The Sand and Gravel Industry Association immediately dispatched personnel to bail them out. However, the sand and gravel from Wantai was eventually unloaded, totaling six to seven hundred tons.

Refusal to Load: The Coal and Stone Barge Association issued a notice yesterday stating, "Regarding the matter of the notice, we have recently received a letter from the Sand and Gravel Branch stating that there are unscrupulous elements colluding with ronin to form a 'Wantai Company'. Their intention is to monopolize the industry. Our association has investigated and found that the sand and gravel is stolen. Your association and our association have a close relationship. We are requesting that your association strictly refuse to load sand and gravel entrusted by the company until our association has completed negotiations, and please notify all members. At this critical juncture, national unity and mutual assistance are essential. This case is of great importance. All our members should stand together and refuse to load sand and gravel from "Wantai Company" to uphold national policy and fulfill their duty. This is a notification."

Letter to the Guerrilla Team: The Sand and Gravel Industry Association sent a letter to Wang Pinrong, the leader of the Sijiao guerrilla team, stating, "We have received reports from our members that yesterday and today, when sailing vessels carrying yellow sand purchased from Sijiao arrived in Shanghai, they were seized by the self-proclaimed 'Wantai Sand and Gravel Company', which is relying on the power of the Japanese to confiscate the goods and sell them without permission, claiming that the company is jointly organized by Jin Zhengde and other local guerrilla officials, intending to monopolize the business. This illegal act not only cuts off the livelihood of our members but also affects the lives of poor people, requesting relief. It has been investigated that yellow sand is produced in Sijiao. Although the authorities have issued a ban since August 13th, most of the goods transported to Shanghai are supplied to construction companies. Although the Japanese have intercepted some, the number is small. Besides the hundreds of our members, countless ship owners and porters depend on this for a living. Once 'Wantai Company' monopolizes the business, where will these tens of thousands of poor people be placed? We believe that you, as the leader of the Jiangzhe guerrilla army, will not be deceived by any private injustice. In addition to leading all our members to deal with this situation, we are writing to you to request justice. We believe that you will understand the greater good and will not be involved with the puppet organization "Wantai Company". We look forward to your reply to dispel doubts. We are very anxious."

### Gaodeng Withdraws from Shanghai-Taizhou Line; Changes to Ningbo-Taizhou; Libao Increases Sailings on Ningbo-Dinghai-Shipu Line; Resumption of Shanghai-Dinghai No Longer Hopeful

After the resumption of direct sailings on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, there have been significant changes in shipping between Shanghai and eastern Zhejiang. The shipping department of the German Roulund Shipping Company in Shanghai received a telegram from the Ningbo office stating that the Gaodeng ship would withdraw from the Shanghai-Haimen line starting today and switch to the Ningbo-Haimen line because there are no ships sailing between Ningbo and Haimen after the Tangsai and Meda ships switched to direct sailings on the Shanghai-Ningbo line. The Lishi ship, which travels between Ningbo and Dinghai, will add sailings to Shipu starting today, with sailings from Ningbo to Dinghai and Shipu every Wednesday and Saturday, and from Shipu to Dinghai and Ningbo every Thursday and Sunday. The Tianbao ship has withdrawn from the Ningbo-Dinghai line and is now sailing on the Shenjiamen-Dinghai-Xiangshan-Daishan line. Regarding the Shanghai-Dinghai line, the Zhejiang authorities have strictly ordered that it not be resumed. Goods transported from Dinghai to Shanghai or from Shanghai to Dinghai must be transferred via Ningbo and transshipped by boat. This will allow for a general adjustment of shipping and prevent it from being unbalanced. The Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Association has complied with the above-mentioned transportation measures.

### Japanese Side Plans to Actively Dump Japanese Goods in Occupied Areas; Instructs Various Puppet Organizations and Traitorous Merchants to Promote Sales; Chinese Guerrilla Teams Determined to Resolutely Resist

Since the Japanese side launched the war of aggression against China, eighteen months have passed. The war zone has expanded day by day, and the quagmire has become deeper and deeper. Not only is the consumption of military force alarming, but the economic situation is also on the verge of extreme crisis. Therefore, in order to save its last crisis, the Japanese side is becoming more active in its economic plunder of occupied areas. It is reported that the Japanese side has recently planned to find ways to dump large quantities of Japanese goods in the occupied areas of North China, Central China, and South China. The types of goods include canned food, wool products, knitted goods, celluloid, glassware, hats, bicycles, and their parts. The dumping plan has been discussed with puppet organizations in various places, and the puppet side has instructed traitorous merchants in various places to be responsible for sales in order to absorb funds. At the same time, in order to ingratiate themselves with the Japanese side, the puppet "Tianjin-Beijing Chamber of Commerce" and others are planning to go to Japan next month, ostensibly to "inspect industries," but in reality to negotiate trade in Japanese goods. However, in order to break the Japanese side's conspiracy, the guerrilla teams in various places are determined to resolutely strike at the dumping plan for Japanese goods, and the people in various regions will also do their best to automatically resist due to their patriotic enthusiasm.

### Kuling Foreigners' Evacuation Deadline Extended by Ten Days by Japanese Side; U.S. Naval Authorities Broadcast a Second Appeal to Contact Foreign Residents in the Mountains

A mainland newspaper reports: According to information received here from the British and American naval and consular authorities in Kiukiang, the Japanese naval authorities have extended the deadline for the evacuation of foreigners from Kuling to February 20th, after which no further extensions will be granted. Observers in this city believe that, although not explicitly stated in the message, foreigners in Kuling must

leave their residences before February 20th, otherwise the Japanese army will not take them into consideration and will commence large-scale military operations against the Chinese forces in the mountains. It was learned in this city last night (12th) that the British and American authorities in Kiukiang had made every effort to establish direct contact with the foreigners in Kuling, but to no avail. Therefore, they attempted to reach the stranded people through radio broadcasts. News reporter Alcott, at the request of the U.S. naval authorities, made a second broadcast from the Great American Radio Station last night. The first broadcast was made last Thursday night, but there was no response. The message broadcast to Kuling last night stated that the previous broadcast inquired whether third-country nationals in Kuling wished to leave the mountains, but there was no reply. The Japanese military authorities have now extended the deadline to February 20th, but after this, no further extensions will be granted. Previously, the Chinese military authorities in Chungking requested the Chinese forces in Kuling to allow foreign naval and consular personnel to go to Kuling to assist foreigners wishing to leave the mountains, but there was no response from the Chinese military authorities in Kuling. Therefore, foreigners wishing to leave the mountains must make their own arrangements to descend, and these arrangements must be made directly with the Chinese military authorities in Kuling. The Japanese military authorities have guaranteed cooperation in providing

transportation convenience and safety in Kiukiang. As for the Kuling foreigners, they should endeavor to report their descent date to British and American gunboats. It is still unknown whether the two previous broadcasts reached Kuling. However, according to those who withdrew from Kuling some time ago, there are several wireless sets in Kuling, but the local power plant was shut down in October last year. However, it is known that Kuling has a battery-powered radio, which until a few weeks ago,

could still receive transmissions. If that radio has been damaged recently, it is said that there is no way to repair it in Kuling. Upon receiving this information last night, the U.S. naval authorities in Shanghai immediately relayed it to the U.S. warship "Wake" anchored in Kiukiang. According to Japanese telegrams from Kiukiang last night, British and American sailors will escort the foreigners down the mountain. However, this statement has not been confirmed by other sources.

### Various Industries Begin General Year-End Closings; Preparing for Reorganization, Secure Passage Anticipated; Banks and Money Exchanges Busy Clearing Accounts, Exchange Increases Sharply, Markets Will Close for Year-End Accounting

As the end of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic is approaching, various industries are beginning their holidays to handle the general year-end closings. Starting yesterday, banks and money exchanges have been busy clearing accounts, and the volume of negotiable instrument exchanges has increased. The financial market remains stable, and various industries are expected to pass the year-end without worry. Money exchanges will stop paying interest on deposits from today, but overdue interest will still be added. The details are as follows:

Preparing for Reorganization, Secure Passage Anticipated: Fortunately, after the outbreak of war, the financial market in Shanghai has remained unusually stable thanks to the support of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China. After adopting a policy of contraction and increasing their own reserves, various banks and financial institutions have invested funds in the interior to assist the government in developing the interior. At the same time, they have met the demands of various industries by selectively granting loans to domestic businesses in the city. With this assistance, various factories and businesses have experienced unusual development. Therefore, this year's year-end closing period is very different from that of the twenty-sixth year. The low interest rates in the interbank lending market in recent days are sufficient evidence of financial stability. Therefore, there is no doubt that various industries will pass the year-end without problems.

Busy Clearing Accounts, Exchange Increases: Money exchanges began handling the general year-end closings yesterday and will stop paying interest on current account deposits starting today, but overdue interest will still be added. Account clearing in banks and money exchanges has become busy due to the year-end accounting. The volume of exchanges at the bank and money exchange clearing houses has increased sharply. Money exchanges will extend ticket collection time on New Year's Eve, and banks will increase negotiable instrument exchanges. Money exchanges will extend internal business hours depending on their business conditions and will stop all new lending from today. Overdue debts from current account holders must be fully cleared before the year-end closing. A four-day holiday will begin on February 19 to handle the general year-end closing. Various Industries Holiday for General Closing: A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with various industries yesterday: (1) Chinese and foreign banks will take a four-day holiday starting on the 19th; (2) Money exchanges and currency exchange businesses will take a four-day holiday starting on the 19th; (3) The government bond market will take an eight-day holiday starting on the 15th; (4) The soybean and rice market will take a nine-day holiday starting on the 14th; (5) The gold market will take a five-day holiday starting on the 18th; (6) The cotton yarn, flour, miscellaneous grains, hardware, sugar, dried goods, groceries, etc. markets will all take a six-day holiday starting on the 17th; (7) The money exchange market will take a five-day holiday starting on the 18th; (8) Foreign exchange and foreign silver businesses will all take a four-day holiday starting on the 19th. As for the reopening dates of various industries, most will be on February 23, which is the fifth day of the first lunar month.

### Tientsin-Peiping Entertainment Circles Mobilize; Performing Plays to Relieve Disaster; Held at the New Stage, Programs are All Extremely Brilliant

The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association Relief Committee for War Zone Refugees has been providing relief to war zone refugees since August 13th, numbering no less than several hundred thousand people. It is the largest charity organization in Shanghai. The entertainment circles of Tientsin and Peiping residing in Shanghai, mindful of the suffering of the refugees, have voluntarily initiated a charity performance for the Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, with all proceeds from ticket sales going to disaster relief expenses. It is scheduled to be held at the New Stage at 1:00 PM tomorrow. The office is located at the Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road, with Yue Gengbao and Chen Xiaomei as directors. In addition to various novel entertainment programs, there will be excerpts from plays such as "Entering the Palace Twice," "Chopping the Son at the Gate," and "Si Lang Visits His Mother" performed by members of the Yayun Society, Banban Opera Troupe, Xinsheng News Agency, Xinyou Society, Popular Society, Haixin Society, and Mingle Society. The final act will be a play called "Visiting the Temple," which will include stilt walking, dragon boats, yangko dances, and peep shows, all of which are extremely colorful.

Cendrillon Dance Hall to Donate Profits to Relief Efforts: The Art China Film Company's film "Chu-Han Contention" has excellent content and magnificent outdoor scenes. The leading actors are Wang Yuanlong and Jin Suqin, who are both famous contemporary movie stars. It is reported that the Cendrillon Dance Hall, recognizing the urgent need for refugee relief in the city, has obtained the consent of the Art China Film Company to hold a costume performance at Cendrillon before the film is screened. At the same time, barracks will be set up and flags will be erected at the entrance of Cendrillon, creating a scene reminiscent of that era. The performance dates have been set for the 15th and 16th of this month. Tickets are priced at two yuan per person, and 30% of the proceeds will be donated to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to be used for refugee relief expenses.

Nestlé Donates Condensed Milk: Nestlé Milk Products Company, deeply concerned about the plight of refugees in Shanghai, has issued a type of purchase voucher that will donate the equivalent goods to the International Relief Committee for refugee relief needs. The voucher contains the following instructions: "Upon receiving X number of Nestlé condensed milk can sealing strips and keys from Mr./Ms. So-and-so, this company guarantees to directly donate X number of Nestlé Eagle Brand condensed milk cans to the International Relief Committee." It is noted that these sealing strips, etc., must be returned to the company before the 18th of this month, otherwise they will be invalid. The International Relief Committee has sent a special letter of thanks to the company for its enthusiastic disaster relief efforts. The Trade Association Group Re-elected Its Chairman Yesterday: The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Trade Association Fundraising Committee held its first standing committee meeting yesterday. The chairman first reported that the director of the committee, Jin Runxiang, would be leaving Shanghai due to personal matters and had sent a letter requesting to resign. The members unanimously agreed that Jin's enthusiasm for public welfare was highly anticipated by the people of Shanghai and that it was inappropriate to accept his resignation. Therefore, after public nomination, Yu Zuoting was elected as the new director of the committee, and Jin was appointed as a standing committee member to continue to be responsible at any time in the future. The meeting also approved the budget, appointed additional design committee members, set regular meeting dates, and actively promoted fundraising work.

### President Coolidge Departs for America Today; French Postal Ship Athos Scheduled to Return to Europe This Morning

The American President Lines' ship "President Coolidge" arrived in Shanghai from the United States on January 31st and was originally scheduled to set sail for Manila at 5:00 AM on February 1st. However, due to the iron chain tangling around the propeller, a craftsman was hired to cut the chain, which delayed the departure by a day. The ship finally left the port at 11:00 AM on the 3rd. Due to this delay, the ship sped up its speed on the return trip from Manila to Shanghai and will arrive at the port at 7:00 AM this morning, docking at buoys 11 and 12. The ship will still depart for the United States at 5:00 PM today according to the original schedule. It is reported that there are many passengers traveling to the United States from Manila and Hong Kong, and there are also quite a few traveling to Japan. Including those traveling to Shanghai, there are more than 400 passengers in total, not including those traveling from Shanghai to the United States. As for the French company's "Athos II", it arrived in Shanghai at around 2:00 PM on the 10th. While turning around at the Jardine Matheson wharf, it accidentally collided with the "Mailler" ship. The "Mailler" ship was slightly damaged, but it did not impede its operation. Therefore, it will still depart for Marseilles at 5:00 AM this morning according to the original schedule.

### Commendation Order for Gu Nai-chih's Martyrdom; Suffered Torture After Being Captured by the Enemy While Handling Factory Relocation Matters

The Executive Yuan issued Order No. 450 of the Lu character, stating that Gu Nai-chih, the head of affairs at the Shanghai Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, was captured by the enemy and repeatedly subjected to torture while handling the factory's relocation, and eventually died a martyr. He was truly loyal to his duties and courageous in doing what was right. He should be commended to demonstrate encouragement. This order.

### Shanghai Sea Defense Still Open; Stopping at Haikou En Route; Suzhou Mingsheng to Set Sail Tomorrow

Since the war, the number of passengers and cargo transferred from sea defense to the interior has increased sharply. British-owned Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies will dispatch ships to operate the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Haikou-Beihai-Sea Defense line. Since the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, British-owned Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies still send ships normally to operate the Shanghai Sea Defense line, but have stopped stopping at Haikou on Hainan Island. Taikoo's Suzhou ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Sea Defense tomorrow, and Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship is also scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Sea Defense tomorrow.

### Salvation Army Donations Proceed Smoothly

Since the Salvation Army launched its donation campaign a week ago, the results have been excellent. As of last week, more than 31,000 yuan had been received, of which many were donated by Chinese. The Army is very grateful. Anyone wishing to donate may send them directly to 57 Nanjing Road, or notify them by telephone, and the Army will send someone to collect them at the address. The Army has decided that 80% of the proceeds from this donation will be used to help the Chinese.

### Japanese Openly Prohibit the Use of Legal Tender; No Impact on Our Country's Finances; The Legal Tender's Credit is Outstanding, the Foundation is Solid, Japanese Arbitrary Destruction Will Ultimately be a Dream

The Japanese plot to undermine China's financial system. Previously, they massively issued Japanese currency counterfeit money, forced the people in the war zone to use it, and repeatedly depreciated the value of legal tender. All kinds of destructive methods were endless. However, the people in the war zone believed in the legal tender and remained firm to the end. Any threat or oppression had no effect. Recently, the credit of our country's legal tender has become even more outstanding, and the Japanese currency counterfeit money has been widely rejected. The Japanese conspiracy has declared a complete and utter failure. Now that the Japanese economic crisis is becoming more and more acute, they have to expose their hideous faces. Disregarding everything, they brazenly made the puppet organization issue a notice, setting a deadline for banning the use of our country's legal tender. As the end of their road approaches, this is even more credible. According to the Shanghai Yu Rong circles, this move by the Japanese is the same as the various destructive methods previously used, and the result will be the same as the previous failure. Not only will the war zone not be affected, but also the credit of the entire legal tender will not be damaged at all. Our country's financial foundation is becoming more and more solid and stable, and it is difficult for the Japanese to shake it. Destruction will ultimately be a dream.

### Japan's Exclusion of Britain and the United States Intensifies; Retaliatory Measures Should be Taken Immediately; Diplomatic Protests Alone Cannot Solve the Problem; An Arms Embargo by Various Countries Would be Most Effective; The Mainland Newspaper Presents a Systematic Account of the Facts

The Mainland Newspaper reports that the British, French, and American governments sent notes to Japan in mid-January, demanding the maintenance of the Open Door policy in the strongest terms. This was the first time since the start of the war that they had resolutely stood behind the interests of foreign merchants in China. The three notes all demanded a prompt reply, but a month has passed and no reply has been received. At the same time, we have seen Japan directly or indirectly, formally or informally, strengthen its hostile attitude towards foreigners. Although various countries have made the most urgent demands through diplomatic channels to immediately stop incidents involving foreigners, there seems to have been no action to try to satisfy their demands. The situation has

deteriorated, as evidenced by the hijacking and detention of foreign ships. It can be seen that the Japanese are implementing their established campaign to obstruct foreign rights in China. None of the detentions of ships can be justified by the Japanese authorities, and since the notes to Tokyo, the Japanese have added new interference to the freedom of movement of foreigners in cities or ports, such as ordering foreigners in Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao to obtain passes. Even more serious than this, Yantai has implemented import permit restrictions, although the Japanese authorities have extended the grace period to February 15, but after this deadline, the restrictions will be implemented. The economic

institutions in Tokyo have been greatly affected, and Shanghai, the national trade center, has been virtually blockaded. Industry and commerce have been severely affected. Shanghai's financial center status has been repeatedly undermined by the Japanese manipulation of currency and exchange restrictions in the occupied areas. However, many of the Japanese methods have failed. According to an important British businessman in this city, the Japanese, backed by the government, will do everything in their power to push foreign commerce in Shanghai to economic collapse. At present, foreign merchants are extremely pessimistic about their future, and their only hope lies in foreign countries strengthening their joint

The Japanese government has issued a concrete example of its mistakes. The currency issued by the bank has no other preparation than extremely dubious verbal permission. The recent proclamation by the Japanese government to forcibly impose military scrip may be a further attempt to control currency, but the "military scrip" plan is bound to fail, for the same reason that the "Federal Reserve Bank" failed. Japan will eventually realize that within its occupied areas, if there is no gold or trade reserve to back it up, then the issuance of currency is all but waste paper, and Japan's domestic strength is insufficient to supply this reserve. The most effective weapon for the Japanese to monopolize is the

British note, which clearly reflects Japan's infringement of foreign rights in China. The note traces the successive pronouncements of Konoe and Arita and states that even after the meeting between British Ambassador Craigie and Arita, the British anxiety about this declaration has not been dispelled. It concludes by saying that Britain refuses to accept Japan's interpretation of the "New Order in East Asia". International experts here and abroad believe that the restrictive actions taken by the Japanese authorities in the occupied areas prove Japan's attitude towards foreign trade rights and interests in China, such as (1) the closure of all railways and inland waterways to all non-Japanese merchants and (2) discriminatory exchange controls against non-Japanese merchants; (3) providing Japanese merchants with monopolistic conveniences while excluding foreign merchants; (4) restricting the freedom of movement of foreigners in the occupied areas; (5) completely illegally inspecting foreign letters, packages, and telegrams; and (6) interfering with customs' collection of legitimate taxes and imposing discriminatory tax rates on foreign trade. In addition, the Japanese authorities have implemented many other minor restrictions, such as closing the eastern and northern districts of Shanghai, which have also been condemned by various governments, with the British government lodging the strongest protest. Japan launched a war in China, and the

pressure exerted by monopolistic activities. Judging from the actual situation of foreign trade in China, it seems that the UK and other countries are not very clear about it, which is regrettable. The current situation cannot be resolved by exchanging diplomatic notes, protests, and apologies. Western countries have no choice but to retaliate by imposing an arms embargo, and if it is implemented resolutely and appropriately, its effectiveness will be far greater than what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is doing today. According to Arnold, the U.S. Commercial Counselor in Shanghai, the losses suffered by American trade in China have so far reached 200 million yuan. Arnold also said that when the Japanese army advanced into Manchuria, it guaranteed to restore

The policy of opening the door to all parts of China. However, judging from the situation encountered by foreign trade in the area, Japan's opening of the door is of a dual nature, that is, on the one hand, it allows Japanese merchants to operate, while on the other hand, it drives out all foreign merchants. In a note to Tokyo on behalf of the U.S. government, U.S. Secretary of State Hull demanded an end to the discriminatory exchange controls, monopolies, and interference rights, which clearly shows that the U.S. also knows that currency control is the most serious threat to U.S. trade. Although most of the Japanese financial conspiracies have failed, there is currently no sign that the Japanese have given up their economic offensive against foreign trade. The Japanese established the "Joint Reserve Bank" in North China, attempting to supplant China's four major banks, that is, Japanese bankers.

continues to guarantee that the puppet government under its wing still maintains the opening of the door. However, Japan has organized two major companies last year, with the Japanese government providing part of the funding, with the aim of monopolizing North and Central China, with a wide scope, such as public convenience and transportation, and commerce, all of which are completely monopolized by them. Finally, the Japanese military authorities restricted the freedom of movement of foreigners and closed countless markets, allowing only Japanese to operate, such as closing the Yangtze River, seizing railways, closing highways, and inland waterways, all of which are ways for the Japanese to obtain a monopoly in the occupied areas. Japanese merchant ships

can now sail on the "dangerous" Yangtze River, and Japanese merchants are free to operate in the ports along the river, and to transport goods on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. All of these are well-known facts, but foreign merchants are not allowed to enter Nanjing and any areas occupied by the Japanese army. If Britain and the United States do not take a firm stand on this, then the years of hard work in China will be excluded. General Okawa of Japan recently spoke on behalf of the Japanese army and navy, saying that the Yangtze River cannot be opened to foreign ships for one day if the war does not stop for one day. Those who have any doubts about the intentions of the Japanese should dispel their doubts after hearing this.

### 20-Route Trolleybuses to Extend Route; Will Extend to Racecourse, Purchase 15 New Buses

The Shanghai Electric Tramway Company, in view of the high population density in western Shanghai and the overcrowding of vehicles, intends to extend the Route 20 trolleybus route, which currently runs between Jing'an Temple and Zhao Feng Garden, to the intersection of Racecourse Road and Yu Qiaqing Road in order to facilitate residents' travel and expand business. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council has agreed to this. The route will pass through Great Western Road, Avenue Road, Hart Road, New Gate Road, Weihaiwei Road, and then to Racecourse Road. Electrical wires are currently being installed, and it will be completed in the short term. In addition, 15 new buses ordered from the United Kingdom have arrived in Shanghai and are being fitted with accessories in preparation for operation on the new route.

### Government Implements Economic Program Outline Based on Fifth Plenary Session Resolution; Formulates Measures for Managing State-Owned Enterprises, Stipulates Standards for Encouraging Private Enterprises

Since the launch of the full-scale war of resistance, our government authorities have carefully reviewed financial measures, all with the goal of adapting to the war of resistance, increasing national defense capabilities, and meeting the needs of the people. Since its implementation, remarkable results have been achieved in the development of the economy in various provinces in the interior, the adjustment of wartime transportation, the rectification of various taxes, and the promotion of foreign trade, which have been unanimously praised by international friendly countries. Now, the government has decided to implement the following four wartime economic program outlines based on the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session to further advance the program: First, formulate measures for managing state-owned enterprises; second, stipulate standards for encouraging private enterprises; third, organize sound people's economic groups; and fourth, manage various enterprises and products of agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce to strengthen wartime economic control and better coordinate with the military. In addition, the Ministry of Finance will also make further reforms to the wartime tax system based on the resolution of the congress and will actively collect income tax, profit tax, inheritance tax, etc. to benefit the war of resistance.

### Tenants of Miller Road Petition; Stop Disguised Rent Increase; Letter to the Rent Mediation Committee Requesting to Act as Mediator

The Tenants Association of Miller Road yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Special Zone Rent Dispute Mediation Committee, stating that the Association is organized by the tenants of new houses rented by Dehe Foreign Firm on Miller Road Section (i.e., Dagu Road, Chongqing Road, and Maho Road) and 183 Lane of Dagu Road, etc., with the aim of discussing and seeking fair interests for the tenants. Since its establishment, it has been many years, but formerly in July of the 17th year, the owner

### Joint Resolution by the Real Estate Association: Stamp Duty on Rent Receipts; Maximum of Six Cents, Four Cents for Lease Agreements

The Real Estate Association held a meeting the day before yesterday and resolved that from today onwards, all rent receipts used to collect rent should be affixed with stamp duty according to the second item of the stamp duty rate table for monetary receipts. This is calculated as follows: one cent for every dollar, two cents for every three dollars, four cents for every ten dollars, and six cents for every hundred dollars, with a maximum of six cents. For those who collect rent using a ledger, stamp duty should be affixed at four jiao per ledger per year. Regarding the documents and contracts established for leases, each document should be affixed with four cents of stamp duty, regardless of whether the rent collected is for the current month or arrears from previous months. Tenants may return rent receipts that have not been affixed with stamp duty as they have not completed the legal procedures.

The Dehe Foreign Firm cited a sharp increase in the population of residents, leading to a corresponding increase in consumption of tap water and other utilities. To compensate for the aforementioned losses, the firm increased the monthly rent from ninety yuan to one hundred and twelve yuan, and from one hundred and twenty yuan to one hundred and forty yuan, effective from August 1938. At the time, all the residents of our association believed that the tap water had always been supplied by the landlord, and that this sudden change was an unreasonable attempt to disguise a rent increase, and we strongly rejected it. Later, through the mediation of Mr. Chen, the Chinese manager of the firm, and in order to maintain good relations over the years, our residents agreed with the firm that from August 1938, the residents would subsidize a little less than 7% of the rent for storefront properties and a little less than 5% of the rent for residential properties. The Dehe Foreign Firm agreed, and on August 6, in accordance with the firm's wishes, more than one hundred residents jointly signed a letter of acknowledgment. Since August of last year, the Dehe Foreign Firm has included the agreed subsidy fee in the rent calculation (as evidenced by the rent receipts issued to each resident by Dehe since August of this year). This issue of tap water and other fees was settled long ago and acknowledged by the landlord. Unexpectedly, just a few months later, the Dehe Foreign Firm suddenly

### UK Ministry of Civil Aviation Plans North Atlantic Route: From Northern Ireland to Newfoundland, Total Length 2,000 Miles; Route Enables Round-the-World Travel from Hong Kong by Air

According to foreign sources, the British Ministry of Civil Aviation is planning to establish a North Atlantic route, with a journey from Northern Ireland to Newfoundland, a total of 2,000 miles. The establishment of this northern route will indirectly benefit Hong Kong's transportation. Since the world's two major airlines (Pan American and Imperial Airways) have designated Hong Kong as the Far East terminus, flights from Europe to Hong Kong must pass through the Suez Canal to Bangkok, and then transfer to Hong Kong. Flights from the United States to Hong Kong cross the Pacific Ocean from San Francisco, passing through Honolulu, Guam, and the Philippines before arriving in Hong Kong. Passengers who wish to travel from Europe to the Far East via the Americas must first go to New York, then fly to San Francisco, and then take a Pan American plane to Hong Kong, which involves many transfers. The future establishment of the North Atlantic route will remedy this deficiency. Although this route has been

successfully flown since 1919, a civil aviation route cannot be compared to a pilot's occasional experiment. It must be equipped with dense facilities and cannot risk passengers and mail. It is necessary to establish a radio network along the route to report weather conditions ahead and transmit them to the pilot, so they are aware of changing weather conditions and the impact of air currents, allowing them to prepare in advance. After the route is established, those who wish to travel around the world by plane from Hong Kong, starting eastward, can take a Pan American plane to San Francisco, transfer to Vancouver, cross Canada to Newfoundland, take a plane across the Atlantic to Southampton in the UK, and then follow the Imperial Airways route, passing through the Suez Canal and Bangkok back to Hong Kong. Traveling west, one can first fly to Bangkok and finally return to Hong Kong via the United States. It is understood that the route will initially only carry mail and will not carry passengers for the time being,

violated its promise by issuing notices to all residents at the end of last year. The notice stated that the subsidies for residents with self-made water meters would be cancelled from January 1, 1939, and that the supply of tap water to residents who had always been supplied by the landlord would be discontinued from January 15, 1939, and that water meters would be installed, with residents being responsible for the water bills. Upon learning of this, all the residents of our association were greatly surprised. They all believed that the tap water issue had been resolved long ago, and that this sudden complication was an unreasonable attempt to gain improper benefits in the face of the current economic downturn and the hardships of the people, an act of repeated disguised rent increase, which was completely unreasonable. Although the firm recently invited representatives of our association to discuss the matter, proposing that Dehe would voluntarily cancel the previous agreement on resident subsidies, the residents, after consideration, found the difference to be too great to bear. In addition to jointly rejecting this and opposing the installation of water meters, we have specially written to your association, in view of your enthusiasm for public welfare and your commitment to resolving rental disputes in society fairly, requesting that your association mediate, advise the Dehe Foreign Firm to cancel the proposed installation of water meters, or notify us to attend a meeting to attempt mediation, so as to end the dispute and ensure peaceful residence. Not only would all one hundred and several residents of our association be deeply grateful, but it would also be the hope of society.

### Changzhan Wharf Ferry Rights Seized Again: Japanese Manipulation; Puppet "Public Works Bureau" Sidelined; Private Ferry Industry Being Deprived

The water transport business on the Huangpu River has been occupied by the Japanese since the war, generating substantial profits. Recently, the Japanese and puppet authorities have been vying for the long ferry route between the Bund outside the former International Settlement and the Changzhan Wharf in Pudong. As a result, the operating rights have once again been obtained by the Japanese, with the ferry scheduled to open tomorrow, demonstrating that the Japanese manipulation of land and water transportation is becoming increasingly active. Details are provided below:

Changzhan Long Ferry Falls into Japanese Hands Again: The Gongchangzhan ferry crossing in Pudong originally had private cross-river ferries, but these were closed by the Japanese after the war and have not been allowed to resume operations to this day. The puppet "Public Works Bureau" has found that the Japanese control all the long ferries in the northern Huangpu River (Gaoqiao, Donggou, Gaomiao) and the southern Huangpu River (Zhoujiadu, Nanmatou), making it impossible for them to intervene. Recently, arguing that the Changzhan Wharf was no longer of military importance, they requested that the Japanese military open it up to operate a puppet "municipal ferry" line for profit. However, the Japanese-owned Shanghai Ferry Company learned of this and, recognizing the profitability of the ferry crossing, also approached the Japanese military to take over and operate the ferry. As a result of the competition between the Japanese and puppet authorities, the Japanese-owned Shanghai Company obtained the operating rights. The designated route is from Changzhan Wharf to Beijing Road Wharf. Preparations have been completed, and due to the upcoming Chinese New Year, when there will be more civilians traveling, the ferry is scheduled to open early on the 15th (tomorrow).

Two Japanese Companies Compete for Ferry Rights: The two long ferries in the southern Huangpu River, Zhoujiadu and Nanmatou, were originally operated by the Japanese-owned Continental Ferry Company. Because the area connects to Upper South transportation, the business was quite prosperous. The Japanese-owned Shanghai Ferry Company became envious and, in November of last year, sent a "Donggou Maru" ferry to compete, vying with the Continental Company's "Nanhui Maru." However, because the "Nanhui Maru" was faster, passengers abandoned the "Donggou Maru" in favor of the "Nanhui Maru." The Shanghai Company's ferry had few passengers and poor business, so it replaced it with a high-speed, large ferry, the "Chunjiang Maru" (formerly the Fifth Municipal Ferry), which had a superior speed and carrying capacity compared to the "Nanhui Maru," intensifying the competition between the two Japanese companies.

Private Ferry Industry Excluded: Before the war, there were a total of seventeen private ferry lines on the Huangpu River: (1) Lannidu Cross-River Line, (2) Yangjiadu Cross-River Line, (3) Laobaidu Cross-River Line, (4) Dongjiadu Cross-River Line, (5) Nanmatou Cross-River Line, (6) Zhoujiadu Cross-River Line, (7) Chunjiang Wharf Cross-River Line, (8) Fenshan Wharf Cross-River Line, (9) Gongchangzhan Cross-River Line, (10) Yangjing Cross-River Line, (11) Jiajiajiao Cross-River Line, (12) Jujiaqiao Cross-River Line, (13) Shimatou (between Yangjing and Jujiaqiao) Cross-River Line, (14) Gaomiao Cross-River Line, (15) Donggou Cross-River Line, (16) Gaoqiao Cross-River Line, (17) Wusong Cross-River Line. After the war, the Japanese closed all the ferry crossings. Currently, only the Lannidu, Nanmatou, and Wusong cross-river lines have been restored. The other fourteen locations have not been opened, so the private ferry industry has been largely excluded. Thousands of ferrymen have been unemployed to this day, their livelihoods cut off, and they have fallen into poverty.

### Benevolent Association: Performing Arts for Disaster Relief; Venue: New Stage; Date: February 15

### Youth Iron-Blood Anti-Traitor Corps: Destroys Puppet Police Station Again; Two Lottery Gambling Dens Also Eliminated; Leaflets Distributed to Warn Traitors; Gunfire Tight, Fortunately No Casualties

The area along the extraterritorial roads in western Shanghai, after the Chinese army withdrew to the west, saw unscrupulous individuals and those unwilling to do good taking advantage of the situation to set up gambling dens and opium dens, harming society and the people. The severe punishment meted out by the Chinese Youth Iron-Blood Anti-Traitor Corps on the morning of the 10th of this month was truly gratifying. Unexpectedly, these people were incorrigible, and the Chinese Youth Iron-Blood Anti-Traitor Corps carried out another astonishing act yesterday. The details of the events are described below:

Valiant Men Destroy Two Lottery Gambling Dens: At approximately 7:50 AM yesterday morning, a mysterious team suddenly appeared on the side of Jessfield Road in western Shanghai. They were all robust men, numbering more than ten, each holding a Mauser pistol. Upon a command, they immediately formed a team and advanced towards the Dean Lottery located at No. 1214 Jessfield Road. They fired several shots first. When the gamblers inside suddenly heard the gunfire, they scattered like dogs that had lost their homes, fleeing in all directions. Seeing that the gamblers and innocent people had dispersed, the mysterious team surrounded the den and stormed in, distributing proclamations with the words "Awaken, Traitors, Turn Back Early." In a short time, the gambling den had been completely destroyed. Not long after, the team returned to Xinsen Lane on the same road and destroyed the Yuwengji Lottery den, which had been destroyed by the team on the morning of the 10th, but had resumed gambling in recent days despite failing to conceal its activities.

Gunfire and Destruction at Puppet Police Station: At 8:05 AM, this mysterious team appeared again in front of the puppet "Caojiadu Police Substation" at No. 553 Brenan Road. They fired several shots with Mauser pistols and destroyed part of the puppet "substation" building. Upon hearing the news, the puppet police inside frantically hid. The team then distributed leaflets and fired more than ten shots before leaving proudly in the direction of Zhaofeng Park, whereabouts unknown.

Dense Gunfire Shakes Residents: Before 8:00 AM, residents near the Hujiazhai area of Jessfield Road frequently heard more than ten gunshots, waking up many residents from their sleep and causing panic. Later, it was learned that guerrillas had attacked the area. In fact, the gunfire came from the team at the Dean and Yuwengji Lottery locations. It is estimated that the team was active in the Brenan Road and Jessfield Road areas for a total of one hour yesterday.

Various Leaflets Distributed Everywhere: Afterwards, residents in areas such as Brenan Road and Jessfield Road obtained various leaflets from the group, including "Support the Supreme Leader, National Unity, Resistance Will Surely Succeed, Nation-Building Will Surely Succeed," and "Traitors Willingly Act as Thieves, Becoming Slaves of the Enemy, Selling Out the Motherland and the Interests of the Nation, Should Be Eradicated," and "All True Traitors Must Be Shot."

### Machine Belt Breaks, Worker's Legs Severed

Sheng Shengnan, a 21-year-old worker from Wuxi at the Huade Printing and Dyeing Factory in Gaolang Bridge, Yangshupu, was working next to a machine at approximately 10:00 AM yesterday when the belt on the machine suddenly broke, causing Sheng to bear the brunt of the impact. His lower body was caught in the belt, and both of his legs were severed. He suffered injuries all over his body, bleeding profusely, and fainted to the ground. He was rushed to the Shanghai East Hospital by ambulance, but died from his injuries upon arrival.

### Small Vegetable Markets Extend Business Hours; Limited Hours Insufficient; Extension to Take Effect from Tomorrow

Due to the approach of the Chinese New Year and the increased business, the current limited opening hours of the Shanghai Special District's small vegetable markets, as restricted by the concession authorities, are insufficient to meet demand. It is understood that the markets have obtained permission from the concession authorities to extend business hours by several hours each day, starting from tomorrow.

### Adopted Daughter Poisons Adoptive Mother; Suspected of Murder for Money; Defendant Suddenly Retracts Confession, Denies Poisoning; Autopsy Pending, Further Investigation to Follow

Zhuang Xu, a 60-year-old woman from Songjiang, residing at No. 146, Dexing Lane, Peng Road, had no children after her husband's early death, except for a 33-year-old adopted daughter, Qian Zhuang, who was married to Qian Wenbiao, a Ningbo native employed by a tobacco company. Hoping to live out her remaining years, Zhuang Xu recently suffered from a cough. On the afternoon of January 16, she took herbal tea to relieve her cough. Unexpectedly, Qian Zhuang, who had always been on bad terms with her mother, put ten poisonous pills of some kind into the medicine pot. After drinking it, her mother was poisoned and died at 4:00 AM the following morning. The incident was reported to the Huishi Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Fang Qingyun to escort Qian Zhuang to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The police station learned that the deceased, Zhuang Xu, had accumulated several thousand gold coins, which were stored in a bank, and that her daughter, Qian Zhuang, had previously stolen two gold rings, a gold watch, and a bank passbook from her mother. Moreover, Zhuang Xu's death by poisoning raised suspicions of murder for money. Qian Zhuang later suddenly retracted her confession, denying that she had added the poison pills to the cough medicine. An order was issued to summon witnesses for further investigation. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, filed a public prosecution for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Xu Ge, a woman from Ningbo residing at No. 24, Guling Road, testified that she was a relative of the deceased through adoption. Because there were constant quarrels between the mother and daughter, Zhuang Xu brought two suitcases and a handbag containing a bank passbook to her place before the mid-August of the lunar calendar and stayed for a week. She then went to the home of her fellow villager, Gu Sheng, in the Eight Immortals Bridge area of the French Concession. She did not take the suitcases with her when she left. It was not until after her death that her son-in-law, Qian Wenbiao, and her nephew came to open the suitcases and take away the clothes and bank passbook they needed. She did not know about her daughter (i.e., the defendant) stealing her mother Zhuang Xu's jewelry and passbook. Sheng, a woman from Songjiang, testified that the deceased, Zhuang Xu, did indeed stay at her home before the Mid-Autumn Festival for as long as two months. Later, her son-in-law, Qian Wenbiao, and his wife came and took Zhuang Xu back. She did not know about the defendant stealing her gold jewelry and passbook, or about putting the pills into the cough medicine to commit murder. Jin Qian, a woman from Songjiang, testified that the deceased was her aunt and had lived with her for thirteen years. She used to be in good health, but recently she had been coughing and bought cough medicine. At that time, she did not see the defendant, Qian Zhuang, add the poisonous pills to the medicine pot. After the medicine was brewed, she poured it out and gave it to her aunt to drink, not knowing that it contained poison. The defendant's young daughter, Yu Zhen, was not asleep at the time and was waiting by her side. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. Judge Huang ordered that the body of the deceased, Zhuang Xu, be autopsied by a forensic doctor, and that the autopsy report be submitted for further investigation. The defendant was remanded in custody.

### Zen Chong Foreign Firm Sues for Illegal Sale of Cement; Shanghai Cement Factory Owned by the Firm; Criminal Complaint Filed Against Defendants for Receiving Stolen Goods

The Shanghai Cement Factory in Longhua, due to debt relations, transferred all the factory's machinery, equipment, and a large quantity of Elephant Brand cement to the German-owned Zen Chong Foreign Firm for management the year before last. When the National Army withdrew to the west, the factory's security personnel left in March of last year due to the environmental situation. From then on, the Zen Chong Foreign Firm was unable to continue sending people to

guard the factory. Before long, the factory was occupied by the Japanese army and jointly operated by Mitsui Foreign Firm and Japan's Noda Cement Factory. The factory and the stored cement were sold in the market. The Zen Chong side had no choice but to publish announcements in various Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai, warning all brick and ash dealers that anyone who bought Elephant Brand cement from the factory would be

considered to be receiving stolen goods. Recently, ten brick and ash dealers, including Yantai on Aiduo Road, Huiyuanxiang on Beijing Road, Tailaishanji on Shanxi Road, Qiada on Xinzha Road, Fuxing on Aidongya Road, Wanchang on Qipu Road, Xinyi on Aiduo Road, Yinlaifeng on North Jiangxi Road, Zhengda on North Henan Road, and Rongchangxiangji on Qipu Road, disregarded Zen Chong's warning and openly bought Elephant Brand cement from the factory. After investigation by Ke Lixi, a German in charge of cement business at Ci Chen (Zen Chong), lawyers Liu Shifang and others were engaged to file

a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court against the managers of each of the firms, (names omitted), requesting that they be punished for receiving stolen goods in accordance with Article 349 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, this case was heard in the eighth criminal division of Rong Duo court, and the defendants were summoned to court for trial. The plaintiff's lawyer stated the facts of the case and presented invoices for the sale of Elephant Brand cement by the defendants' stores to prove the fact that the defendants had received stolen goods. When questioned, the defendants all stated that the cement they sold was purchased from Dahua Trading Company, Yuanda Trading Company, and Kuoke Tongji, and they engaged lawyers to defend them. After verification by Judge Dai, it was decided to adjourn the case to 10:30 AM on the 27th of this month for further hearing.

### Timber Firm Clerk Embezzles Over 1,000 Yuan in Accounts Receivable; Spends It All in Shanghai West Gambling Dens; Unable to Account for Funds, Falsely Reports Robbery; Arrested and Further Investigated

Renfeng Timber Firm in Nanshi, which was established by Lu Youcheng, a Shanghai native, moved to the French Concession after the outbreak of the war and the fall of Nanshi. In addition to setting up a warehouse, its business office was located at No. 32, Caishi Road. Recently, due to the approaching end of the lunar year, when a general accounting was due, clerk Zhu Xiangcheng (44 years old, from Taicang, residing at No. 135, Testere Road) was sent to the Pudong Nanhui Zhoupu area to

collect accounts receivable. He collected a total of 1,470 yuan in cash. On the 9th, he returned to Shanghai with the funds. Unexpectedly, Zhu did not return to the firm to report and hand over the funds but instead went to the Xiangsheng Company gambling den in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, to gamble, hoping to win a large sum of money for the New Year. Little did he know that heaven's net has large meshes, but it lets nothing through, and ill-gotten gains do not enrich the poor. Over the nights of the 9th and 10th, he

lost all the accounts receivable. He reluctantly returned to his residence and instructed his wife to report to the owner of Renfeng Timber Firm, saying that he had been robbed of all the funds on the evening of the 9th while returning to his place by rickshaw at the intersection of Western Electric Light Street on Aiduo Road. Zhu's wife then went to Renfeng Timber Firm to inform the firm owner, Lu Youcheng, about her husband's robbery after collecting accounts receivable in Shanghai. The next day, Lu Youcheng became suspicious and went to Zhu's residence to question him about the robbery. However, Zhu's story proved to be false, and his answers were inconsistent. Lu reported the incident to the French Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Zhu. A piece of paper with gambling records for dice games was found on his person. When asked what the paper was for, Zhu confessed that he had gambled away the accounts receivable. The detective ordered him to be taken into custody. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District for trial by Judge Liao Yuan. Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer for the French Concession authorities, stated that the defendant was being investigated for embezzlement and requested a postponement pending further investigation. The plaintiff, Lu Youcheng, appeared in court and stated that the defendant had been sent to collect accounts receivable and gambled away the funds, falsely reporting a robbery, and engaged lawyer Huang Jiyuan to file an incidental civil suit to recover the embezzled funds. When questioned, the defendant Zhu Xiangcheng confessed to the charges. The court decided to remand the defendant in custody pending further investigation and hearing.

### Robbery in Xin Hui Le Lane

At approximately 5:00 AM yesterday morning, three robbers broke into a brothel at No. 8, Xin Hui Le Lane, Yunnan Road. One of them was holding a handgun. They drove the procuress Jiang Lao Er and the prostitute Li Meimei into the middle wing room and threatened them. One robber guarded them while the remaining robbers ransacked the rooms, resulting in the theft of clothing, jewelry, national currency, and other items totaling 820 yuan. The incident was reported to the Gangzha Police Station for investigation.

### Dispute Over Dancers Leads to Enmity; Dance Hall Manager Beaten; Assailant Confesses; Victim Seriously Injured; Court Orders Postponement

Qi Runfu was the manager of the Daxin Dance Hall on the fifth floor of the Daxin Company on Chaqing Road. Recently, the dance hall hired two new dancers, Wu Mengdie and Chen Huijun, to join the dance team. Chen and Wu were originally dancers at the Xianle Dance Palace on Jing'an Temple Road. After the two women switched to Daxin, Xianle also attempted to recruit dancers from Daxin, but only

managed to lure away Tan Xuehua. Since Xianle had gained more than it lost, and due to the issue of face, a feud arose. At 11:50 PM the night before last, as the Daxin Dance Hall was closing, Qi Runfu, accompanied by Assistant Manager Zhu Zigu and Gu Yukang, manager of the Guotai Dance Hall, took the elevator down from the fifth floor and were about to get into their car to return home when suddenly

more than ten thugs armed with wooden sticks swarmed forward and beat Qi all over his body with the sticks, causing his head to be broken open by the sticks and bleeding profusely. His right arm was also injured. A chaotic scene ensued, and police sirens blared. Chinese constables Nos. 2305, 2430, and 3126 from nearby posts arrived and arrested the assailants, Tian Chengqi from Shaoxing, Jia Afu from Ningbo, and Liu Mingwei from Shanghai, seizing three wooden sticks. The remaining assailants scattered and fled. They were taken to the Laozha Police Station, where Chinese Detective Zhang Keqin and Detective Lu Shouchang. sent Qi to Renji Hospital. Examination confirmed that he had been injured. Qi then went to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted the arrested suspects to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District. Zhang Shizhu, the police station's lawyer, filed a lawsuit for

assault under Article 283 of the Criminal Law, stating that the plaintiff had been seriously injured and could not attend court, and requested a postponement for further hearing. He also stated that the defendants had confessed at the police station that they had been recruited by Wang A'gen, who was still at large, and had discussed the matter in Room 528 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel. When questioned, Tian confessed to the charges, while Jia and Liu denied them. Lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang were engaged to defend them. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Fang Qinghuan ordered a postponement for further hearing in one week.

### Evil Intentions of a Chauffeur: Conspiring to Rob Funds – Further Arrest of Mastermind Li Ada in the Yongtaihe Robbery Case

Chen, an employee of the Yongtaihe Tobacco Shop distribution point at 303 Xujiahui Road, was carrying 8,533.20 yuan at 8:40 AM on the 12th, intending to deposit it at the head office at 784 Jiujiang Road. When he reached the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Jiujiang Road, three robbers suddenly came forward and snatched the money. Subsequently, a Chinese constable on duty nearby caught one of the robbers, Sun Hongsheng from Jiangbei, seizing a pistol, thirteen bullets, and all of the original stolen money. He was taken back to the Laozha Police Station. Chinese detective Zhang Keqin discovered that a chauffeur named Lao Zhang, who usually parked his car in front of the Yongtaihe head office, knew that employees from the distribution point would come to deposit money every morning. He developed evil intentions and colluded with Yang Lao Si, who is still at large, with the intention of robbing the funds. Lao Zhang, realizing they were too few, discussed it with Li Ada from Jiangbei, who resided at 1132 Xiaoshabo Road, Lane 25. Li introduced Sun to join them. The detectives then arrested Li. Yesterday, they were jointly escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Bao, requested a postponement of the hearing, stating that the case still required investigating accomplices. After Judge Xie Fen examined the facts, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and postponed the hearing.

### Extortion of Huang Peng and Others: Debate Concluded, Case Dismissed – Defendants Ordered to Post Bail and Await Review

Zhu Zhongsheng, a 35-year-old man from Chuansha residing at 312 Ladu Road in the French Concession, claiming to be a guerrilla commander, learned in early October of last year that Huang Peng, a Shanghai native residing at 9 Henglifang, Hengli Road, who used to run an iron factory in the Nanshi area and had an office at 531 Zhonghui Building, was allegedly collecting scrap iron to benefit the enemy. He sent a letter warning Huang. Subsequently, Huang contacted Zhu and paid him 4,540 yuan in cash and 1,000 yuan in public bonds. Later, Zhu sent a threatening letter, along with a bullet, to the home of Huang Jisheng at 358 Fulili Road. The French police discovered this and arrested Zhu and his accomplices, Zhou Junmei, Zhang Yaozhong, and Bao Shida, at the Dalai Hotel, Room 15, Ganse Dong Road, for extortion. They also seized a pistol, two hand grenades, and drafts of letters with symbols. They were handed over to the Second Special District Court. The French Concession authorities filed a public prosecution for extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Code. The defendants also hired lawyers to defend them. After several court sessions presided over by Judge Zhang Minsheng, the debate was declared concluded, and a date was set for the verdict, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao Yuan, acting on behalf of the First Criminal Court, ordered the defendants to be brought to court. He announced the conclusion of the debate was rescinded and ordered the defendants to each post a 1,000-yuan bail and be available for summons at any time, pending further review.

### Why Do Adult Men and Women Get Married?

Although this is a very common question, who can answer it well?

Why do men and women, once they reach adulthood, almost everyone inwardly yearn for marriage? Almost everyone can answer this extremely common and interesting question, right? If someone answers that this is because physiological maturity creates a need, we cannot say that they are wrong. But what is called need? Why is there this need? How is this need created? I am afraid that few people can say very accurately and clearly about these kinds of problems. So to say "knowing is difficult, doing is easy" is really the truth.

Who does not need marriage? Although there are many men and women playing out the rules of elopement, forced marriage, refusal to marry, divorce, etc., this is precisely their performance demanding reasonable marriage. If it is a reasonable wish for marriage, who does not have an ardent and urgent need? What is called need? Where does the need come from? We can use eating as an analogy. When the stomach is hungry, there is a need to eat, because the mouth, stomach, and intestines are organs that manage digestion. They are constantly carrying out digestion, but digestion must have food as the object. When food is in the mouth, the lips and teeth cooperate to chew it, and when saliva comes, it is mixed with the chewed food and swallowed. When it enters the stomach, the stomach begins to contract and secrete gastric juice to turn the food into a gruel, and chemical reactions occur to the fats, starches, proteins, and other substances. Then it enters the intestines, and the intestines also begin to peristaltic movements to absorb the nutrients into the blood and discharge the impurities. If the food is digested, the stomach and intestines are empty, but the process continues. At this time, there is a feeling of hunger and a need to eat. The so-called need comes from this. It is the same reason that adult men and women need marriage. A physiologically mature and strong man produces a kind of seminal fluid in his reproductive function. This seminal fluid continues to be produced and continues to stimulate the body, resulting in a strong sexual desire. In short, it is the so-called carnal desire or sexual desire. Based on this need, if he marries a beautiful and admired woman who pleases his heart, then the life after marriage will be very sweet. They will form a happy family, give birth to clever children, and create a bright future for themselves. How happy is this kind of life! If a man suffers from nocturnal emission due to masturbation in his early years, or is licentious and indulges in lust after marriage, damaging his reproductive function and depleting his seminal fluid, breaking out with spermatorrhea, kidney deficiency, impotence, exhaustion, neurasthenia, and other symptoms, then even if he has a beautiful wife, he can only sigh in vain! But his wife's youth is like flowing water, and youth will never return. How can she endure this sacrifice for long? Therefore, a state of dissatisfaction often occurs in her mind and body, and she feels resentful, resulting in frequent quarrels, scoldings, separations, and divorces. At the same time, if a man's body persists in this way, he will inevitably age prematurely or even die young! The danger is unimaginable – the only way to save him, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, is unanimously recognized that the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" (Reproductin) is the most effective and specific. Because this kind contains pure quality and is mild in nature, it can produce sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate the blood, and soothe the nerves within one day and night after taking it, reducing and stopping the disease. If you continue to take it, you can completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and you can also make your body healthier. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Ximituo's Spermacrasia Tablets" to consolidate the spermatic gate and stop premature ejaculation, so that the root and the branch are treated together and the effect is even faster!

### Beautiful Breasts are the Bell of Victory for Women

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Also the Key to Happiness

Every man, when choosing a spouse, who does not want to choose a healthy and beautiful woman? So, if a woman wants to win in the game of love, health and beauty cannot be ignored.

Originally, health and beauty are related, because with a healthy body, there can be a healthy ovarian function. With a healthy ovarian function, the characteristic beauty of women will develop and be particularly outstanding. The first is that the breasts are high and erect, standing side by side in front of the chest, with a deep state in the middle. How beautiful is this! Because this kind of woman is healthy, her metabolism must also be vigorous. Not only are her muscles plump and fair, and her posture graceful and charming, but her face is also rosy without the need for powder. Adding to this a broad mind and a healthy body, a state of happiness, is she not like the beauty of a peach blossom welcoming the spring breeze? How similar is her beauty! So to say that health and beauty are really one and two, and two and one, is what people today generally call "health and beauty." That's what health and beauty means. A healthy and beautiful woman! Not only do they have advantages everywhere, but they also win everywhere. There is no doubt about the sweetness of love and the guarantee of happiness between husband and wife after marriage. However, in today's chaotic society, misfortune often befalls women. The most common phenomena are irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, breast pain, thin face, premature aging, and other symptoms. Even if they were originally very beautiful women, they will become the ugliest. As a result, their fate turns to tragedy! The only way to save them, according to world-renowned gynecologists and my experience, is to take the ovarian preparation for women, "Shengzhisu (Reproductin)", which will definitely promote ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, make the breasts erect, the cheeks rosy, and the above symptoms can also be completely cured, making them a healthy and beautiful woman.

Common Ailments of Youth

### The Best Method to Cure Seminal Emission on Your Own

— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Jinzeng

Seminal emission in young people is mostly due to hormonal stimulation in the body during adolescence or youth, or peeking at obscene materials, or being seduced by bad friends, and weakly indulging in masturbation, causing abnormal secretion in the youth gland, injury to the brain, and pathological changes in the nervous system, resulting in the discovery of nocturnal emission. Once nocturnal emission occurs, most sufferers do not care at all, leaving it untreated, resulting in the frequency gradually increasing, and after a long time, there is also emission without dreams, emission even during the day, and even after slight exertion, a slight thought, and after bowel movements, seminal fluid will automatically flow out. When the condition reaches this point, the loss of essence and blood is too great, and the spermatic gate is lax. The person then rushes rapidly towards the path of weakness.

In addition, there is also a kind of young person who does not understand medical theory. Because the impact of seminal emission on him is too bad, he believes that this is a lifelong incurable disease, and he is pessimistic, frustrated, worried, and resentful. As a result, the body becomes weaker day by day, and seminal emission increases. This is of course also a reason for the aggravation of the disease.

In short, "a great wind rises from the end of a stalk." No matter what the problem, when it first arises, it is very slight, and then it gradually worsens. The same is true of seminal emission. Therefore, if you seek to remedy seminal emission urgently when it is nocturnal emission, it is easier, but the patient often neglects it, and it must be until the bad consequences are formed, and various symptoms of weakness break out - dizziness, blurred vision, poor memory, poor development, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, night sweats, premature ejaculation, impotence, etc. - and then they rush to save themselves, but the body has already suffered a lot!

The most effective treatment for this disease is to directly take "Ximituo's Spermacrasia Tablets" to consolidate the spermatic gate. Its efficacy can stop emission that night and can soothe the brain. You will not suffer from insomnia. Secondly, it is to actively take the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Shengzhisu (Reproductin)" to restore health in a short period of time to the body that has been injured by masturbation-induced sperm production. Because after seminal emission, it will inevitably lead to neurasthenia, but it can be cured by taking "Shengzhisu (Reproductin)".

### Innovative Treatment for White Turbidity?

Inferior medicines and clumsy surgery that do not treat the symptoms are all in the process of being eliminated!

Using the latest scientific treatment to solve general incurable white turbidity

In today's era of rapid scientific advancement, white turbidity, which was generally considered difficult or incurable, can now be cured. Originally, many cases of white turbidity could be cured in a short period of time, but they are often delayed by quack doctors' clumsy surgery and inferior medicines that do not treat the symptoms. They either lead the poison deeper or make the disease sticky, grinding down the patient's resistance. As a result, they lead to an irreversible outcome. Therefore, those who suffer from white turbidity or those who have been treated repeatedly for many years must pay extremely careful attention to seeking medical advice and taking medicine.

Originally, after white turbidity is transmitted from unclean heterosexuals, it deliberately destroys the healthy physiological structure and changes various pathological conditions, such as bacteria invading the reproductive organs and causing prostatitis, orchitis, and seminal vesiculitis. Invading the urinary organs causes cystitis and nephritis. Invading the blood causes arthritis, periostitis, and myocarditis. Sometimes, due to improper treatment methods, there are complications with two or more complications, such as orchitis and cystitis often occurring simultaneously. Or first develop prostatitis and then seminal vesiculitis, etc. All of these symptoms are caused by improper treatment methods. Under these complex changes in gonorrhea symptoms, only experts with extremely rich experience and the use of complete medical equipment can dissect the pathological images. I have been using this principle to treat white turbidity in various stages for more than ten years, and I can definitely cure it within the time limit. I use high-magnification red microscopes and bladder reflectors, urethral examination mirrors, etc. to examine various difficult symptoms. I also use German filter gonorrhea and current therapy, whose bactericidal power can directly reach the lesion, supplemented by German Hess serum for intravenous injection, which can search for gonorrhea in the blood and completely phagocytize it. At the same time, I also perform surgery to correct the pathological conditions. This treatment method is completely based on the most advanced science and is completely different from those treatments that are purely theoretical and have no practical effect.

### It Is Wrong To Restore Bad Customs

— Mao Lie

Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the "New Life Movement," many of our bad customs have indeed been eliminated. If the enemy had not invaded us, and we could have concentrated on construction, at least in this one aspect of bad customs, we could have achieved results that would satisfy history. Unfortunately, the enemy did not allow us to build and initiated war, destroying our construction plans. Consequently, the New Life Movement was also forced to a standstill under the primary necessity of military affairs.

We have many bad customs, especially those surrounding the abolished lunar calendar. The New Life Movement had already devoted much effort to correct this period. Since the outbreak of war, partly due to the lingering effects of the New Life Movement last year, and partly because everyone seemed unsettled, some bad customs were not observed. At that time, I thought that perhaps these bad customs could be eliminated altogether. Unexpectedly, after a year, as the new year approached, all sorts of bad customs were gradually being restored. The most detestable of these is the revival of superstition!

These days, when we open the newspaper, we can see advertisements for "Gifting the Kitchen God" and "Gifting the God of Wealth." We can also see news of police intervention caused by year-end thanksgivings. I do not understand why such strange phenomena still exist today. If there were no war, if the New Life Movement were still being promoted, I think these strange phenomena would not occur. At the very least, these strange phenomena would not be so openly displayed. Therefore, for the sake of the revival of superstition, which leads to the revival of all bad customs, I cannot help but lament the inadequacy of our national policies and the indifference of our island citizens towards supporting them!

Of course, in these coming one or two weeks, many more bad customs will follow, and superstition accounts for the majority of them. To waste useful money and time in useless places, while being unwilling to contribute even a single hair to the relief of refugees or other contributions beneficial to the overall situation, I ask everyone to think, is this reasonable? If ignorant commoners are acting in such a reckless manner, those knowledgeable citizens above the middle class should enlighten and correct them. But now, the knowledgeable citizens above the middle class are themselves the first to revive these customs. I am truly heartbroken by this! No wonder indignant people want to say: those who are now reviving bad customs, especially those who are reviving superstition, have not only become ignorant commoners, but are simply unpatriotic and have forgotten the nation!

Remember well: our new year has already passed. Let all bad customs, especially superstition, rot in the trash can! Our enemies are gleefully claiming to restore our "old morality" and are actively promoting all bad customs for us, especially all superstitions!

### Savage

— Yang Yanqi

In movies, I like the savage characters played by Wallace Beery. Among friends, I like the savage Old Good.

"Old Good" is not his name; "Savage" is not his name either. He has a really good temper, not just good, but too good. So friends call him Old Good. And there is another reason: his replies to people always include the word "good." But he is not a yes-man; he is a savage. If you disagree with him, he is sure to beat you half to death.

His hair is never combed, but he refuses to shave his head like a monk because he hates monks the most. He said that once he was playing in Hangzhou and saw two monks eating meat in a small restaurant. He never forgot this, saying that such monks are not human. Afterwards, as soon as he sees a monk, his fists clench. But he has never actually taken a monk's head. Perhaps his "savageness" still has some limits.

His family is wealthy, but he vowed never to use half a penny from his family after the age of twenty. Unfortunately, when he turned twenty, he had not yet graduated from middle school. He needed to study but had no money. If he looked for a job, people would think he was too savage, and he could not do anything. He could not write, he could not think, perhaps he could only go to Spain to fight bulls.

He often wakes up screaming in his dreams when he hears that the Japanese are bullying us, waving his fists and shouting. The blanket on the bed falls to the floor, and he catches a cold from it, which makes him sick. During his illness, he seems to go crazy, causing his landlord to evict him. He shouts loudly, walks away, and leaves all his furniture and luggage behind. The landlord searches his belongings but finds nothing. Even if he pawns them, he would not get two dollars, far from the four months' rent he owes.

After this, he actually never returned. He is nowhere to be seen in Shanghai, and no one knows anything about him. His friends do not have the time to care about the affairs of a savage.

Today, a friend received a letter from him.

He joined the army long ago. He thought this job was very suitable for him, but we were worried that he would not be able to follow the discipline and would definitely cause trouble. As expected, he got into fights with his superiors several times a day and was eventually discharged. It is said that on the day of his discharge, he almost jumped into the water. But later he saw that the river was too shallow, and he would not die if he jumped, so he gave up the idea of suicide.

Later, later came August 13th. He was so poor that he did not even eat pancakes. Many old friends were willing to support him, but he did not look for any of them, and he ignored them all. He only knew how to cause trouble everywhere.

But in the end, in the end, he joined the army again. People looked up to him because he was a middle school student; but he looked down on others, especially the superiors, and he found everyone unpleasant to look at. People taught him how to shoot, and he picked up the gun and aimed at the officers.

Changed, changed to doing engineering work.

Recently, the Japanese army attacked Bao'an on the Dongjiang front, and he also joined the ranks and participated in the Huangsonggang battle. It is said that because of his bare hands and bravery, the enemy retreated.

Last night in a dream, I saw the Savage again. I saw that his face was still full of fierce flesh, his arms were thicker, his head was big, and his shoulders were wide, and he was still so "savage." However, he had a big knife in his hand, and there was blood on the knife, and there was light in the blood. The light shone on my eyeballs and told me: "The Savage is killing the enemy for the country!"

I jumped over: "Old Good!" He pushed me away with one hand and ran away.

### The Road to Revival

### China's Wartime Music

— Sheng Muzhong

The "Marseillaise" ignited the power of the French Revolution, and "Marching to the Deepest Part of the Tirpitz" was a famous military song that helped the British and American armies win victory during the war. Chinese music experts understand this historical experience and are writing or teaching many wartime patriotic songs for the general public and frontline soldiers, hoping to cultivate a new combat spirit through the sounds of singing. In this difficult process, the national spirit of the entire country will be further promoted.

This type of patriotic song gradually became popular after the January 28th Incident. It was first sung in the military. At that time, the Central Military Academy taught mostly American wartime songs as models because the professor there was a student who had studied in the United States. From that time on, new military songs emerged one after another, with the lyrics all focusing on "resisting Japan" and "recovering lost territory."

Later, a group of progressive young music writers felt that using foreign music scores not only did not suit Chinese phonology, but also because the melodies were unnatural, it was not easy to penetrate the common people. So, they changed their approach, matched popular tunes, and composed new war songs and marches, such as "Going to War," "March of the Earth," "Song of Peace," etc. These were all the most innovative songs at the time.

### Not Reading the Newspaper

— Geng Zhi

Who does not read the newspaper? Illiterate villagers? No. Those in the business world with a smattering of literacy? No. Poor students who know how to read but do not have money to buy newspapers? Even less so. Of course, there are those among these people who do not read newspapers, but since they are illiterate, have a smattering of literacy, or do not have money to buy newspapers, their not reading the newspaper is not surprising, and I do not need to mention it specifically.

The non-newspaper readers I am talking about are the so-called highly educated intellectuals (such as university presidents), scholars and celebrities, wealthy merchants and tycoons, or high-ranking officials. I have indeed encountered these people, and I have encountered them a lot. They mostly use their ears instead of their eyes, and believe rumors. Their sources of information are restaurants, dance halls, theaters, reception rooms, stock exchanges, and even brothels. They hear that there is nothing to see in newspapers, that they are nothing but rumors, and that only their hearsay is the correct news. Some say that there is nothing to see in Chinese newspapers and that you have to read foreign newspapers.

I am not intentionally slandering them. If you do not believe me, you may want to visit a few such people and try it out. What they know, if not old news from a few days ago, is a fragment of a certain event. They say they are very busy and do not have time to read the newspaper. If you want to talk to them about national affairs or world affairs, they will shake their heads in an old-fashioned way and say, what is there to talk about these things? Then they launch into a long stream of complaints, saying that China is not doing well. Otherwise, they will at most answer you politely a few words, and then change the subject. They do not read the newspaper, and what they want to read is not current affairs. They do not like to talk about things in the newspaper, and what they want to talk about is not current affairs. They have their own high opinions and points of attention.

I once met a certain official and said to him, there is some news on a certain newspaper that is unfavorable to you, what do you think? He said, let it be. He explained it very clearly; very few people read the newspaper; of these few people, perhaps only half see the news; of this half, perhaps only half pay attention to this matter; of this half, perhaps only half of this half understands the matter; of this half, perhaps only half of this half knows me. Only a few people, what harm is there to me. Of course, his first premise, that very few people read the newspaper, is indeed referring to a very small number, so after all the reductions, he can face it calmly.

However, no matter who does not read the newspaper, in my opinion, there is nothing surprising. It is only the people who write the newspaper who do not read the newspaper, which is the greatest wonder in the world! You think there is no such thing in the world, and I am fabricating it? But I have several friends who are reporters, and they are indeed the ones who do not read the newspaper. For example: those who edit the news do not read the supplement; those who edit the supplement do not read the news; those who edit the important news do not read the local communications; those who edit the local communications do not read the important news; those who edit the local do not read the international; those who edit the international do not read the local; ... they only look at what they edit when they are editing, and when they have finished editing, they go home. When the newspaper comes out tomorrow, it has nothing to do with them, and they never make a habit of turning a newspaper from beginning to end like ordinary people. He has no interest in the newspaper at all. His involvement in this is only regarded as a profession, and he has no choice but to do so. Although the newspaper is created from his hands, is it right for me to say that he does not read the newspaper?

There are so many people in society who do not read the newspaper, so although China is large and has a large population, and the proportion of literacy is small, the percentage of literate people who read newspapers is so small that it is really amazing, and the underdevelopment of newspapers is a natural result.

Whenever there are major events at home and abroad, the sales of newspapers will increase slightly, which cannot be considered a good phenomenon. However, when that major event passes, the sales will return to their old state. There are still very few people who read the newspaper.

Since the War of Resistance, the importance of newspapers seems to have become more urgent. But those we talk about who do not read the newspaper, the upper classes and the reporters, are still everywhere. When will it be realized that every literate person, like foreigners, must read a newspaper in bed or at the breakfast table every day!

I cannot guess the reason for not reading the newspaper, nor can I study the remedy.

Mid-length novel

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

"Aim to the east, at that biplane bomber, get ready quickly - fire!" Battalion Commander Xiao couldn't help but shout anxiously when he saw two or three shots had missed.

The muzzle kept turning, emitting smoke. The gunner was busy loading ammunition and measuring. Then, with another "bang," this shot was effective, hitting the oil tank of the plane. A thick smoke and fire erupted from the plane.

"Good! Another hit!" Battalion Commander Zhao shouted, clapping his hands, and pulled Regimental Commander Ye to run toward where the plane had fallen. Just as they had run ten steps, suddenly there was a thunderous roar of artillery, and a shell flew straight towards them. Regimental Commander Ye reacted quickly and quickly pulled Battalion Commander Zhao to the ground. The shell exploded in front of them, and the soil splashed up several feet high.

"Another symphony of planes, artillery, and tanks!" Regimental Commander Ye said with a sneer. He and Battalion Commander Zhao crawled like snakes and continued to run to the front line.

"Report Regimental Commander and Battalion Commander," a fully armed messenger ran over and said, "Our army on the right wing of the Shanghai-Hangzhou line has already retreated here..."

Before he could finish speaking, another messenger rushed over in a panic: "Report... a phone call from the division headquarters!"

Regimental Commander Ye and Battalion Commander Zhao hurried back to the trenches. Sure enough, our army on the front line was already retreating, with light and heavy weapons, machine guns, and ammunition boxes piled up behind the defensive line. Regimental Commander Ye did not have time to inquire in detail about the situation on the front line. He picked up the just-assembled military telephone and heard the familiar and cordial tone of the division commander telling him that the troops fighting on the front line had been ordered to retreat to the national defense positions to hold firm. At the same time, he issued an order to him, ordering their regiment to be responsible for covering the retreat of the right wing.

The sound of gunfire in front was getting closer and closer, but judging from the sound, the battle was obviously still very fierce. Regimental Commander Ye immediately issued an order, telling all the soldiers to prepare. The piercing whistle sounded in the bamboo forest, and soldiers continued to retreat from the front line. They seemed to have been in battle for a long time, exhausted and weak, with red threads in their eyes, but they were still very brave. As soon as they retreated into the trenches, they turned around and aimed their guns outwards.

Planes continued to drop bombs with a "boom," and anti-aircraft guns were still roaring. The sound of gunfire in front was even closer, and enemy tanks equipped with heavy artillery had begun to crawl out on the horizon. Shells exploded a few yards away with a deafening sound, and some flew directly to the rear of the position. Soldiers retreating from the front, some jumped into the trenches safely, and some fell silently, fulfilling their wish to sacrifice themselves for the country.

Regimental Commander Ye's eyes almost burst into flames. He grabbed a hand grenade at random, jumped out of the trench, and shouted:

"Brothers, fix bayonets, charge forward! We are the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and we must use our flesh and blood to hold this outer defense line of the national defense, to cover the safe retreat of our friendly forces!"

Responding to him was an earth-shattering roar of killing, and more than a company of soldiers followed him out of the trenches. But at this moment, the enemy's tank brigade also appeared, and the fierce artillery fire forced them to retreat again. At the same time, in the artillery positions behind, the first artillery shells to defend the national defense positions began to roar out. (12)

Spring and Autumn

### Rascal Behavior

— Lishi

"Rascal" is the scum among rogue friends. His desire to exploit is the most ruthless, his methods the most clumsy, and his techniques the most vile. Therefore, what is reflected in his behavior is the most despicable and shameful. Not only will the general public abhor him, but even his rogue friends will look down on him.

When rogue friends carry out intimidation and extortion, they still have to use eighteen twisted reasons as a basis for "bargaining." If they encounter someone who is tough, who "does not accept the basin," and the "axe cannot be opened," they will simply give up, turn around, and show "ease" and "elegance." The "rascal," however, is different; if he wants to defraud someone of their property, he will not hesitate to "open the heavenly gate" or "pretend to be a fool." When he is tough, he is vicious and evil, and when he is soft, he cries and sobs. If neither soft nor hard tactics work and the "axe cannot be opened," he will also pull and tug, dragging people down into the water, in order to expand the matter and lure timid third parties to help him a little. If he sees an opportunity, he can use this to step down. Although his intentions are very painstaking, his goal is to seek "honor," but it is still cunning and shameful.

Japan's invasion of China, since the July 7th Incident, we can simply say is entirely a record of rascal behavior. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident was the beginning of a "pretending to be a fool" rascal behavior. Afterwards, because they became more and more tired from fighting, and China became stronger and stronger from fighting, seeing that the situation was not right, they constantly created incidents that hindered the rights and interests of friendly nations, such as: injuring Hsu Ko-sen, bombing the American Panay, the British Ladybird, blockading the Yangtze River, and so on, too numerous to mention. Their purpose was nothing more than to lure friendly nations into their cunning scheme, to step forward and pressure China to yield. Who knew that they would all fail. Now, on the one hand, they want to report back to the domestic public, and on the other hand, they want to quickly negotiate a peace, so they are making trouble in Hainan Island. This "digging" can be considered quite vicious. Because Hainan Island is important but not so important to China, which has no navy. But in terms of the military situation in the Far East, if Japan occupies it, then Hong Kong, Singapore, Annam, and the Philippines will all be seriously threatened. But precisely because this "digging" is so vicious, it also reflects its danger, seriousness, and rascal nature.

The "extremely effective card" of a rascal friend is risk-taking. If a timid third party does not respond with righteous and truthful actions when disaster strikes, then when the "extremely effective card" is played, what follows will be "complete and utter disaster"!

### Returning From the School for the Deaf

— Shu Hongping

How pitiful are the many disabled people in the world! Among these many unfortunate marginal people, some are the results of congenital evil, some are the result of man-made destruction; either limbs are broken, or the body is leprous, or both eyes are blind, or deaf and mute. Despair and depression erode their gray souls all day long. In the world, they will never enjoy a little happiness. And the most painful are the blind and the mute; even more painful are the blind and mute children. Think about it, at a young age, they will forever live in darkness, unable to see anything; or their mouths have lost their function, and the meaning hidden in their hearts cannot be directly expressed, which is simply more painful and sad than death! And the education of the disabled based on the spirit of human love is even more worthy of attention and assistance!

There used to be several schools for the blind and schools for the deaf in Shanghai, but since the outbreak of the war, most of them have been closed, and the few that remain have mostly reduced their scope.

The author has a relative's son who is a deaf child and is preparing to enter a school for the deaf to receive education, so yesterday he made a special trip to the XX Road XX School for the Deaf to visit.

This school for the deaf was originally on Hongqiao Road in West Shanghai, but the invaders' artillery fire finally refused to let go of these disabled children abandoned by heaven, and they were forced to move to the concession. The current school building is a part of a middle school that has been borrowed. There are more than forty students, more boys than girls. Except for fifteen boarders, the rest are day students. The school also employs a nanny who specializes in managing this group of deaf children. Although the facilities are extremely simple and there are not many students, it is said that this school is the best in Shanghai's schools for the deaf in terms of educational performance.

When the author went, it was time for the deaf children to attend class. They were sitting quietly, and the deaf teacher was standing on the podium, making various gestures to teach them. These gestures are the only tool they use to directly express their thoughts. The author almost laughed at the side at the time; but immediately a solemn revelation suppressed my smile. I should not laugh. Laughing in front of this group of unfortunate people is the most despicable action, because the infinite sadness is hidden in their funny gestures!

The author talked with the person in charge of the school for a long time. According to him, there is currently no secondary education for the deaf in Shanghai, because the age of deaf children entering school is generally older than that of ordinary children, so after graduating from elementary school, they can find a job to make a living.

As for the future occupations of deaf children, the most common is to work as typesetters or printers, but if there are no acquaintances to take care of and instruct them, disabled people are prone to suffering losses everywhere. Some families are relatively wealthy, so after completing the elementary school curriculum, they engage in learning specialized skills, most of which are painting and sculpture. In modern times, many artists are disabled, because after one organ is disabled, the other organs must be more developed than ordinary people.

On the way back from the school for the deaf, the author suddenly thought of a passage in "The Education of Love" written by Amicis, which said that the Italian schools for the deaf can enable children who were originally deaf and mute to speak. Is this probably not true? Otherwise, it would be so worthy of blessing for this group of pitiful deaf children!

### Year-End Scenes

— Mo Dian

While the festivities of Christmas and the New Year, the crazy atmosphere, have not yet faded from our minds, now we have encountered what is commonly referred to as celebrating "our own New Year." Shanghai, after being called the "Isolated Island," sometimes really feels like living in the dark abyss, needing to work hard to break through the surrounding darkness; but sometimes it feels that after being "isolated," this big city seems to be decorated more beautifully and prosperously! This is precisely the bright and dark side outlined by serious work on one side and debauchery and shamelessness on the other.

While those refugees whose homes were destroyed by the invaders' artillery fire, were forced by the big landlords to roll out of the grass sheds where they sought shelter from the wind and rain, were being whipped by the "directors" who deducted their food, or deliberately robbed things and voluntarily went to prison to spend their remaining years, the "Isolated Island's" Christmas and New Year created unprecedented consumption records; This "paradise on the barrel of a gun" is now filled with songs and dances, a truly peaceful atmosphere!

When celebrating "our own New Year," we should naturally be even more energetic, shouldn't we? The whole family is mobilized to paint the living room a new color, Heavenly Bamboo and wintersweet have been offered on the natural table, and "Heavenly Official Bestowing Blessings" is also smilingly displayed in the central hall once a year. Sending the Kitchen God to heaven should be piously kowtowed to and offered sacrifices to, to bless a great fortune in the coming year. This is a good business that makes huge profits with a small investment!

"Oh, time flies so fast!" This is how I sigh every morning when I get up. As a result, everyone seems very hardworking; in the morning, they go to buy fish, buy meat, and also vermicelli, dried bamboo shoots, and mushrooms... Oh, it's really troublesome! But in my heart, I am holding a kind of indescribable happiness.

In the afternoon, go to the department store. The fabric should be cut early, the tailors these days will "raise prices." The children must also have a new piece of clothing. Coming out of the silk and satin department, the sun is already setting in the west, go to the candy department immediately. Gifts and fruit plates are prepared very carefully, and those things fill a car.

I occasionally think of when I took refuge in Hong Kong, I didn't put so much effort into it. I really want to rest comfortably for a day tomorrow, but I have to personally visit a few places where I have been invited to the New Year's Eve dinner...

I also forgot to describe a wife, who specially bought a new mahjong set.

"New Year's is coming!"

In the corners of the streets, at the foot of the walls in the alleys, there are still countless crowds lying there, they are recalling their hometowns and the scattered bones and flesh!

### Abandoned Infant by the Roadside

— Gong Huai

When the morning light parted the curtains of night, sleepily climbing the rooftops of skyscrapers, the clang of streetcars already echoed in the harsh morning breeze. Due to my job, I wake up very early every day, crossing the desolate Avenue du Père Robert, to catch Trolleybus No. 24. The biting cold wind mercilessly lashed at my face, chilling me to the bone, and I couldn't help but shiver slightly.

At the corner of a short, low wall, I discovered a frozen-to-death abandoned infant. The small corpse was wrapped in a worn cotton-padded jacket, face turning bluish-gray, eyelids drooping, the face shriveled by the cold wind like a wrinkled orange peel. The pitiful little life lay quietly under the low wall in a pile of withered weeds, left to the sympathy of passersby!

In my short sixteen months in Shanghai, this was the seventh abandoned infant I had seen. Whose parents could bear to abandon their newborn child by the roadside? To end its short life in the cold wind is simply too cruel! Why are such abandoned infants so often found in the city? Based on common sense, there are no more than three reasons:

First, in this society that still retains thousands of years of feudal influence, there are many unmarried men and women who, forced by family circumstances, cannot achieve the goal of "all lovers becoming husband and wife." If they become pregnant, they cannot reveal the child to their relatives and friends. Some, before giving birth, risk death to have an abortion for the sake of their parents' or their own "reputation," despite the authorities' strict prohibition. The tragedy of abortion is still enacted everywhere. Others secretly change their names and go to hospitals to give birth. After delivery, the man takes the child out, entrusts it to someone to abandon, or secretly gives birth at home and abandons it. Because Shanghai is a society of promiscuity, it is no wonder that abandoned infants are often found. The poor innocent child, just meeting the world, bears the "sins" of its parents and quietly leaves the world again!

Second, there are families with too many children, where the parents cannot provide enough care and want to send them to orphanages. However, these are often full and refused. If they want to give the child away, sometimes they cannot find a suitable recipient. To escape the responsibility of raising their children, the parents abandon them by the roadside at birth, letting them live or die.

Third, the parents are too poor, unable to earn enough to feed themselves, let alone support another mouth. In such a miserable environment, they have to harden their hearts and abandon the infant brother or sister. It is truly a "matter of necessity" and a human tragedy!

I hope that charitable and compassionate people will actively donate to establish more orphanages to take in these infants who cannot be openly raised or who cannot be raised due to lack of means. Preserving some vitality for the nation is truly a work of immeasurable merit.

Who would have thought that the parents who love their children the most would sometimes become executioners who directly kill their children? Whose fault is it?

### Correction

Yesterday's article "Shanghai Children's Magazines in the Last Six Months" had some discrepancies due to the time lag between receiving and publishing the information. The original author sent a letter requesting the following corrections: (1) Volume 2 of "Little Master" has been published; (2) "Good Friend" has been greatly reorganized after issues 4 and 5; (3) "Children's Ten-Day Journal" is published in a thin edition; (4) "Children's Daily" has been reissued.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Four: Tracing the Past, Letian Relays Wonderful Words; Forging New Friendships, Scenic Spots Make Pure Excursions

Moreover, because the country gives preferential treatment to wounded soldiers, they do not have to buy tickets on trains and ships. As long as they wear this honorary medal, they can go anywhere. No matter where they are, everyone will offer their seats, willingly standing themselves. Now, after the three young ladies saluted him, he returned the salute and knew that the three were together. He smiled and wanted to stand up, saying, "Does this young lady not have a seat? I can move elsewhere so that you can talk more easily." As he spoke, he leaned on his crutches and started to get up. Wu Junsu hurriedly helped him, saying, "No! No! I have a place." She thought that he only had one leg and was, after all, a disabled person, which must be somewhat inconvenient. In fact, he supported himself with two crutches and walked very fast; almost no one could catch up with him. Recently, women in intellectual circles have shown respect to wounded soldiers, and wounded soldiers, in general, have been very polite to women. To say nothing else, the nurses who took care of them in the hospital were young ladies who transformed their roughness into gentleness. At this time, however, the elderly man sitting next to him was alarmed. The man looked very much like a businessman. He stood up and said, "I'll give up my seat! I have a friend over there, and I was just about to go over and talk to him." The old man then sat in front of his friend's seat, giving up his seat for Wu Junsu. Because this train arrives in Nanjing at 1:30 in the afternoon and returns to Shanghai at 2:30 in Nanjing, it can make a round trip on the same day. There is also a dining car attached, with both Chinese and Western meals available. Chinese meals range from 30 cents to 50 cents, and Western meals range from 50 cents to one dollar. Passengers on the train going to Suzhou and Wuxi do not need to eat. Those going to Zhenjiang and Nanjing will inevitably feel hungry. The same is true when coming from Nanjing to Shanghai; eating a dinner on the train at six or seven o'clock is not unacceptable. There is also tea on the train. Short-distance passengers will not drink tea, but those going long distances will only be charged ten cents for tea. This is all managed by the train attendants and is not contracted out to merchants. After everyone was seated, the one-legged friend, who was a great conversationalist, asked Wu Junsu, "What is your honorable surname, young lady?" Junsu said, "My surname is Wu. What is your honorable surname, sir?" He said, "I am the first surname in the Hundred Family Surnames." Junsu said, "So, you are surnamed Zhao. Are you taking the train to Nanjing?" He said, "No! I live in the countryside of Wuxi. I'm going to Shanghai this time because of some matters." Father looked at the two Misses He and said, "I guess these two must be sisters because their appearances are too similar." (39)

Entertainment World

### The Qipai Style

— Si

Since the decline of Wang and Sun's styles, the Qipai style has occupied a considerable position among male roles, especially in today's Shanghai, where it can be considered flourishing. The Carlton, Great Stage, and Common Stage all have Qipai actors distributed among them. It is truly not easy for Zhou Xinfang, Chen Hefeng, and Gao Baisui, the three central figures, to gather in one place.

It is said that Zhou Xinfang, the master of the mountain appearance, advocated this style due to his voice. He is intelligent by nature and has managed to lay such a solid foundation. The Qipai director's singing, dialogue, and acting are all excellent, but his dialogue and acting are the best. I have seen his "Chasing Han Xin," "Phoenix Mountain," "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty," "Beheading the Tang," and the recent "Wen Sucheng," and all of them excel in these two areas. His recitative is incredibly clear, every word is powerful; his expressions depict the characters in the play vividly. Xue Xin and Chongzhen are particularly good. His singing wins with its flavor, such as "Chasing Han Xin" and "Sweeping the Pine," which are won by singing.

Gao Baisui is the most successful of the Qipai successors. His loud voice and strong physique are Baisui's advantages. His dialogue is slightly off the beaten track, and his singing lyrics feel slightly jarring. Now that he is on the same stage as his teacher at the Carlton, he can improve a lot. His best plays are "Fighting Yan Li" and "Linjiang Post," and "Chasing Han Xin."

Chen Hefeng's art is improving extremely fast. Three years ago, listening to "Chasing Han Xin," there was nothing to admire, but last spring, performing "Hongmen Banquet" and "Beheading the Classics Hall" at the Great Stage, he had made great progress. He can perform plays such as "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty," "Gorgeous Fate," and the above-mentioned "Beheading the Classics Hall" and "Hongmen Banquet."

In addition to these, Yang Baotong, Wang Chunbai, Zheng Yuanlin, Zhu Junpei, etc., all excel at learning the Qipai style. Dong Zhiyang privately admires it deeply. Among amateur performers, Zhang Zhongyuan is the best, followed by Cheng Yuzhang, Hua Zhenya, Yang Ancheng, etc. Wang Qijun has a special skill in "Sweeping the Pine."

### Memories of Li Xuefang

— Xu Muyun

Li Xuefang in Cantonese opera. Both beauty and art are excellent. Kang Youwei of Nanhai once inscribed the plaque "Southern Snow and Northern Plum" to promote her. In the winter of the eighth year of the Republic of China, I repeatedly listened to Li's plays at the Guang Stage. Li performed "Shilin Sacrificing the Pagoda" and "Tears of the Setting Sun," the ups and downs were tactful, like weeping and complaining. And the "anti-line" in "Sacrificing the Pagoda" was especially sad and moving, making people's noses sour when they heard it. Peking opera always uses the slow three-beat of "anti-erhuang" to express sad plots. Singing this is more desolate than the tone of the male actors. The "anti-line" of Cantonese opera is the "anti-tune" of Peking opera.

Xuefang's demeanor is generous, and her movements are unrestrained. Her performance of "Daiyu Burying Flowers" really has the appearance of floating like an immortal. At that time, the emerging plays in Shanghai, such as "Hongbi Fate," and the helmet worn by Luo Hongxun suddenly emitted electric light. The audience was amazed. In fact, it was plagiarized from Xuefang's "Burying Flowers" play. In that play, when Daiyu came on stage, a flower chair was placed on the stage in advance. As soon as she sat down, countless small electric lights shot out at the same time. At that time, Xuefang was at her prime, wearing ancient costumes and plain clothes, as if surrounded by stars holding the moon. She was truly no less than a fairy of Yaochi. The qin used in Cantonese opera has a tone that is not very high, at most it can be like the "fanzi" tone of Peking opera. The drum is made of wood, and the sound is also low. Therefore, it is very suitable for the syllables of the "anti-line". However, in the past, Chinese opera was not yet noticed by various friendly countries. As a result, the musical instruments on various occasions have not been improved. At that time, it was midwinter. On the day of performing "Burying Flowers", it happened to be snowing heavily and the weather was extremely cold. However, the two people on the stage who played the cymbals and gongs were wearing shorts and bare feet, and their upper bodies were also naked. The gong was hung on a wooden frame, about two feet in diameter. One person stood in front of it and struck it with a large hammer. The size of the cymbals was slightly like the large gong of a small opera (larger than the Suzhou gong). The person in charge of this struck and danced. In a few minutes, he was covered in sweat. With such a strange scene, and striking with such force, how could it not be deafening? After watching Xuefang's play, I often told people that Li's singing and acting were too elegant and too literary, making people never tired of listening to it. However, the scene was too vulgar and too wild, making people afraid to see it. How could there be such a big difference? Now, time has passed. Li is reappearing. It is again the season of late winter. I wonder if the dancers of gongs and cymbals that I saw in the past can be seen again on the red carpet.

### Talking About "Short Films" (Part 2)

— Xin Liang

(2) Educational Short Films -- Russian filmmakers all agree that film is the best educational tool. In fact, this is indeed undeniable. In today's Chinese schools, when various facilities cannot be enriched, these educational short films are especially needed. If we could film solar eclipses, the printing process of newspapers, the development of the southwest corner, the Japanese army's frenzied bombing of Chinese refugees... etc., we could enjoy the knowledge of various subjects in a small room. Everyone needs education, which also means everyone needs these educational short films.

(3) Cartoon Short Films -- Besides news short films, the most popular are probably these cartoons. They are countless comic drawings with continuity drawn with ink pens and photographed by special cameras. It does not need actors, nor does it need sets and other things, so the scope of its subject matter is larger. It can be used for comedy, or it can be used as an educational propaganda tool. Walt Disney of the United States is famous for drawing "Mickey Mouse," and the recent "Snow White" is also his masterpiece; whether it is male, female, old, or young, everyone who sees the lively and colorful pictures cannot help but laugh! In the past, Chinese cartoon products were not many, only a few works drawn by the Wan Brothers, and now they are even more silent.

(4) Sports Short Films -- It also occupies a large part in short films. We will always often encounter short films of horse racing, boat racing, rugby matches... etc. The characteristic is to shoot various wonderful postures in slow motion. We can see on the screen how Xu Chengji kicks the ball and how Owens breaks through the white line. Also, for example, when two horses seem to reach the finish line at the same time, and our eyes cannot distinguish the order of the two, we can use the photos taken by the camera to accurately determine.

In addition, there are also comedy short films, literary short films, etc. I don't want to talk more about it here. In short, at present, the production of short films is developing rapidly. Chinese film capitalists! Why don't you spend the money and energy to shoot mythological films on these meaningful short films? I sincerely hope that Chinese educators and scientists can also jointly help the film industry to open up a new road.

### YMCA Music Trends

— Dai Zi

Recently, the Chinese YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge has been vigorously promoting music and art, and there are often concerts or string concerts held in the auditorium of the association. So, when we walk by there, we can often hear the sound of music, stimulating our eardrums.

Now the YMCA has specially established a "Youth Orchestra," with an attached orchestra class, with the aim of popularizing noble and elegant music and cultivating good character. The subjects are violin and mandolin, and the program is divided into elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels. The elementary level is sight-reading and preliminary practice, the intermediate level is various exercises and ensemble methods, and the advanced level is ensemble and solo methods. Mr. Salomon, a violin master, personally teaches violin and mandolin. Each semester is scheduled for three months. At the end of the semester, a concert will be held. In addition to the students' performances, famous musicians are also invited to participate in the performance.

The "Youth Orchestra" of the YMCA is open to anyone who loves music and has experience in orchestral music. There are already many members, who have performed in various places and have achieved good results. As for the students of the string class, after they have reached a certain level, they can join the orchestra and become formal members.

On the evening of the eleventh of this month, a charity music concert will be held in the YMCA auditorium, with famous music groups or individuals from all over Shanghai joining the performance, which will be quite lively. Then, on the evening of the twelfth, another music concert will be held to bid farewell to Zhu Qidong, a music teacher from the YMCA who is traveling to the United States. The program is also very exciting, and all the famous musicians in Shanghai will participate in the performance.

Looking at the various situations above, the YMCA has been quite excited about music recently.

Golden Theater: A Glimpse of the Women's Yue Opera Joint Performance

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Township Group Fundraising Committee and the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai jointly organized a joint performance of all Shanghai women's Yue opera troupes at the Golden Theater. Yesterday was the first day. The Tianxiang, Tongshang, and Dalai three troupes jointly performed the complete famous play "Three Champions Seize a Wife". It was sold out before twelve o'clock, and the grand occasion was no less than the last time at the Renewal Stage. The magic of women's Yue opera can be seen. Here is a brief record of what I saw after watching.

"Three Champions Seize a Wife" is another name for "Sinking Incense Fan", which is the most exciting in Yue opera. The plot is romantic and tortuous, moving people's emotions, and the joint performance of the three classes makes it even more colorful. Yao Shuijuan's Wenxiang has a beautiful appearance, lively and witty, and other talented people include Yao Yueming, Yuan Jinxian, Shang Fangchen, Liu Peizhu, Qian Miaohua, and Dai Hongmao. Performing famous plays with famous actors, the grand occasion is unprecedented. Most of the audience are from the Ning-Shao gang.

### Era "Female Warrior": A Quick Sketch of Tan Jinlin's Banquet

— Yu Gong

Zhang Wenjuan Recognizes a Senior Fellow Disciple at the Banquet

Ms. Tan Jinlin, the "Miniature Yang Xiaolou" of the small theater, her art has been supported by a large audience, and people in the literary and artistic circles have also greatly appreciated her. The day before yesterday (the twelfth), in order to connect with the literary and artistic circles, she held a banquet at the Tongxing Building on Fourth Horse Road, with Mr. Lai Lansheng as the "general host," and more than forty people from the press and ticket circles attended, which was a great event at the time. Jinlin was originally performing at "Chang Le", but she has now been hired by "Era" and will take the stage on the eighteenth night (that is, the lunar New Year's Eve). She plays the male warrior role, and it can also be said that she is about to step onto the "female warrior" of the era.

Her future colleague Ms. Zhang Wenjuan also arrived, sitting on the left side of the old ticket friend Xu Heizhen, and on the right side were Mr. and Mrs. Ding Muqin. Mr. Ding said with a smile: Wenjuan and Xu Hei are sitting together, it is really a beauty with white hair, contrasting each other. During the banquet, Wenjuan also met a senior fellow disciple, the Ping opera veteran Zhang Xiaochu, who also studied opera with the old actor Chen Xiuhua. Most of Wenjuan's operas were also taught by Chen Xiuhua. Yu Yu said: Not only are they senior fellow disciples, but they were also one family five hundred years ago. It can really be said that they are "of the same school and of the same path." Wenjuan is innocent and lovely, snuggling up to Mrs. Ding and calling her mother. Because Muqin and his wife were going to Li Xuefang's house for New Year's Eve dinner, Wenjuan also left first.

Tan Yulin, his father Yongkui, his sister Xiangyun, and Mr. Lai Lansheng were hospitable, and the host and guests were happy. Yongkui was Gai Jiaotian's old partner in those years. He was quite generous. He was fifty-four years old and smiled when he saw this grand occasion. Jinlin's speech and demeanor also have a great fatherly style, and her acting is also awe-inspiring, unlike a woman. Xu Heizhen put on the line from the "Su Huan Tao" opera where Dou Erdun praised Huang Tianba and said: "The father is a hero and the son is a good man, and there are no weak soldiers under a strong general." It is really an unchangeable conclusion.

According to Tan Yongkui, Jinlin recently learned a complete "Three Towns in Fenzhou", which tells the story of Yue Fei of Jiulong Mountain subduing Yang Zaixing, and it is also a good historical play. It will be performed at "Era" soon. I always thought that with this good material, it would be a bit difficult to maneuver on the small stage of the "small theater", "The heroine has no place to use her martial arts!"

Actors' Addiction to Eating, Drinking, Gambling, and Playing with Birds, Beasts, Insects, and Fish

Wine, women, dogs, and horses—these were the common hobbies of Manchus during the late Qing Dynasty. Because they were born with privileges and many were descendants of royalty, members of the imperial clan, iron-helmeted princes, and nobles of the ranks of Beizi and Beile, these young masters were all born into wealth and raised in luxury. They only knew how to spend money seeking pleasure to pass the time each day. Therefore, listening to operas, visiting brothels, raising eagles and dogs, and feeding fat horses were their most ordinary hobbies. However, after the Republic came into being, those aristocratic young masters who lived in the eastern city of Beiping, some still holding hereditary titles of prince or general, all ended up begging for food or pulling rickshaws. If you are an old Beijinger, when you go out and hire a rickshaw, you might see those men around fifty years old, hunched over and looking like old guns, speaking perfect and crisp Beijing dialect, taking small steps, and barely able to control the rickshaw. Almost nineteen out of twenty of these people enjoyed good fortune in their youth and indulged in the pleasures of wine, women, dogs, and horses. Because they had not received an education since childhood and had not learned a skill, after the dynastic change, they were unable to do anything but pull rickshaws and beg for food. The most ridiculous thing is that when they violated traffic regulations and were hit by the police with wooden sticks, they often complained loudly, telling the people in the rickshaw or passersby about the power and prestige of their family in the days of the late Qing Dynasty. Sometimes when we heard this, we found it both laughable and pitiful. Some mischievous people would even make fun of them, saying, "Who told you to enjoy all your fortune in your youth and not save some fun for now? Hurry up and be happy!" When they heard this, they could only sigh and continue to work with their backs to the sun and their legs running busily, how dare they look back and remember the past?

During the late Qing Dynasty, when the custom of prostitutes offering wine was still prevalent, people from opera troupes often mingled with these young masters, frequently visiting the residences of princes and nobles. Over time, they also picked up some hobbies such as raising crickets, playing with goldfish, releasing pigeons, and training falcons. Among these things, Yu Shuyan, Jin Shaoshan, Wang Huifang, Xun Huisheng, and Guan Dayuan and his son were the most fond of them and spent the most money.
