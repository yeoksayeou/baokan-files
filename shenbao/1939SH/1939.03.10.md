Chinese troops are currently holding the positions on the southwestern slopes of the Dahong Mountains, 20 kilometers south of the Fengle River, strongly resisting the Japanese army's attacks. Because the highway north of Zhongxiang is muddy and unusable, preventing the use of mechanized units, the Japanese army has been heavily shelling Chinese positions since yesterday and dispatching large numbers of aircraft to bomb Chinese positions repeatedly. The fighting on the northern front near Suixian is still fierce. Suixian was once in danger, but ultimately relied on the Chinese army's vigorous counter-attack to repel the invading Japanese troops, turning the situation from danger to safety.

Editorial

### China's Victory and the Interests of Other Countries in China

"If China wins the war of resistance, its national power will flourish and its talents will emerge. Will the interests of other countries in China then be squeezed out by the Chinese government and people?"

I wonder if there are any friendly countries that harbor such unfounded fears? According to a report in a Japanese newspaper in Tokyo, Sir Victor Sassoon, a British magnate in Shanghai, while traveling abroad, passed through Japan on his way back to Shanghai and told a Japanese reporter that if China wins the war of resistance, British interests in China would be threatened. I suspect that this person did not make such a statement. When Mr. Sassoon arrived in Shanghai the night before last, I took the opportunity to ask him about it, and he denied it. Looking back at the Sino-Japanese war, foreign businessmen in China have been bullied by the Japanese and suffered many losses, which has caused great resentment. At the same time, they are worried about their fate after China's victory. Mr. Sassoon denied the rumor, but there are many people who share this concern. It is not only foreign businessmen in China who are worried, but also the Japanese side, who have long used this as a means to sow discord and incite international opinion against supporting China. Therefore, some second- or third-rate politicians and journalists in various countries have been misled and bewildered, saying that there is cause for concern if China wins the war. Some commentators even believe that, apart from Germany, Italy, and Japan, there are other countries that do not want to restrain Japan; not out of any love for Japan, but because they fear that China will rise and they will suffer. The hesitation and vacillation of the international community towards the Far East, which has created a gloomy situation, is also due to the aforementioned concerns.

However, observing the recent attitude of the international community towards China, it has already changed its lip service policy of previous years and is actually taking the opportunity to provide assistance to China. Russia's continuous supply of military supplies goes without saying. The League of Nations and its member states have been sending support to China in terms of technical, medical, and relief aid, one after another. This clearly shows their deep sympathy for China, and it is not a matter of mixed interests. Furthermore, the efforts of Myanmar and Vietnam to vigorously develop their transportation routes to China, and the repeated loans of large sums of money to China by Britain and the United States, are by no means simply a matter of perfunctory gestures or mere comfort. These actions have indeed greatly benefited China's war of resistance. In the face of this situation, while China must be grateful to friendly countries, it is of course not complacent. On the part of Britain and the United States, while they have already taken some action, it cannot be said that they have exhausted their efforts. What is comforting is that the policies of various countries towards the Far East have not been adversely affected by the aforementioned concerns. This is evidenced by the current international situation.

Worries such as those and circumstances such as these, there are no cause-and-effect relationships between them, it is true. However, in order to prevent the sowing of discord, to promote the determination and resolve of the governments and people of various countries, to enhance mutual trust between China and various countries, and to stabilize the moral foundation between China and various countries, it is necessary to dispel such concerns. How to dispel them? If one seeks to understand the origin of these worries, one must know that they are of unclear origin and dismiss them with a smile. If one analyzes the factors that constitute these worries, one will also know that they are based on misperceptions, misunderstandings, and weak and immature notions that are not worth refuting. In my opinion, the most important thing to understand and believe is three points: China is a vast land with abundant resources. Except for a few cities that have been touched by modern trends and have a certain modern scale, other vast areas resemble Europe in the 19th century or even less. The need for development and construction, even if we are just talking about it, is difficult to exhaust, let alone the fact that there is absolutely no shortcut. Therefore, even if China exhausts its national strength after winning the war against Japan, and makes every effort to catch up, it will probably take half a century to achieve even a rough scale. To say that China would abandon this grand vision and merely envy the meager achievements and limited interests of various countries in China, and resort to plunder and squeeze them out, is simply unreasonable and impossible. Even in the so-called few cities, after the devastation of the war, they are full of scars. Even to restore them to their former state will take ten or twenty years. If one wants to emulate modern European and American cities, the difference is even greater. This is the most urgent task for the Chinese government and people after the war, and they do not want to create unnecessary complications by seeking to infringe on the interests of other countries in China. This is the first point. Furthermore, whether it is to rebuild cities or develop rural areas, in terms of China's current human and material resources, success will be difficult. It cannot be denied that the nation's active capital is limited. If one only considers space and not time, that would be one thing; otherwise, to seek simplicity and efficiency, it is essential to obtain assistance from friendly countries, both in terms of capital and especially technology. Therefore, to say that China could both squeeze out the existing interests of various countries and absorb foreign human and material resources is simply not permitted by reason and therefore not adopted by China. This is the second point. From the beginning of the war of resistance until now, more than twenty months have passed. During this time, there have been times when the attitudes of various countries have disappointed China, and even angered China. The past is over, and I will not elaborate on it here. If we were to follow the path of anger, the Chinese people would use the spirit of resisting Japan to resist everything. In that case, this article would be a false and hypocritical statement, and would have no credibility with the governments and people of various countries. But now, we are not doing that. Various countries have changed their lip service policies and are seeking to provide practical assistance to China. China is also grateful for the benefits received and is understanding of various countries. From now on, a foundation of morality will be established between China and various countries. Given the Chinese national character and the old beliefs of China, to say that China will repay kindness with resentment and seek to harm the interests of various countries in China is also impossible and unreasonable. This is the third point. Just as there are voices in the British Parliament that loudly proclaim that China's war of resistance is being fought to protect British interests in China. Such words are close to the truth. Although China does not derive greater or more concrete comfort from such words, it is nevertheless pleased to know that there are those in Britain who are aware of this. The Chinese air force once flew over Japan, but did not drop bombs, only scattering leaflets and returning. This can represent China's moral values.

Only these things can dispel the worries that various countries have about China after the victory of the war of resistance. This is what I hope for.

### British Financial Aid to China; Finance Minister Kong Expresses Delight; Stabilizing Legal Tender Made Easier; Belief in Victory Against Japan Strengthened

(Chongqing) Finance Minister and Executive Yuan President Kong Xiangxi, when meeting with guests today, expressed great delight at the success of the stabilization fund negotiations. He stated that this loan would make it easier to continue maintaining the stability of legal tender. This action further proves the British concern for China's financial and economic situation and is an act of visionary politicians, which can obviously benefit both countries. The Chinese government and people are deeply grateful. (Reuters, 9th)

(Hong Kong) Song Zi Liang met with Reuters reporters today, discussing the announcement of a loan of 10 million pounds to China for the stabilization fund. He expressed optimism about the future financial position of the Chinese government. He stated that the Chinese legal tender has maintained stability since June of last year, and now the joint stabilization fund established by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications on the Chinese side, and HSBC and The Chartered Bank on the British side, has gained an even stronger foundation. China has a surplus in international payments, which prevents foreign exchange reserves from continuing to flow out. Therefore, the establishment of a joint stabilization fund by major Chinese and British banks, whose amount is many times greater than the resources ever used by the Bank of China, is welcomed by all those involved in China's domestic and foreign trade and is considered a factor in the stability of Chinese currency. After Song recounted the currency steps taken by China last year, he further stated that experience has shown that our expectations were completely correct. Although the successive falls of Jiujiang, Guangzhou, and Hankou triggered speculative actions, the foreign exchange market was still firmly maintained. The Bank of China was even able to repurchase all of the foreign exchange used to aid the legal tender in the event of any serious military setbacks when the exchange market was quiet. (Reuters, 9th)

(Chongqing) All sectors of the Chinese community here welcome the announcement of the 10 million pound stabilization fund. All evening newspapers have given it prominent coverage, and the government's wireless radio has broadcast this news everywhere. All sectors of the Chinese community believe that this loan not only has important financial and economic implications but also even greater political implications. The belief in China's ultimate victory in the war of resistance has been strengthened by this loan. However, the government has not issued any comments other than verifying this news. (Reuters, 9th)

### France to Follow in the Footsteps of Britain and the United States in Providing Economic Aid to China; Democratic Nations Take Joint Action; Shattering Japan's Dream of Destroying Chinese Currency

(Washington) According to observations from the U.S. Congress, this joint economic action by democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and France in relation to China is entirely a response to the Japanese implementation of exchange controls and import-export controls in North China this week. According to news from here today, in addition to the British loan of 10 million pounds, France is also preparing to take similar action. At the same time, these actions all lead to the same goal as the previous U.S. loan to China through different routes. (Associated Press, 9th)

(Paris) According to news revealed today, the French government will jointly provide economic assistance to China with Britain and the United States, guaranteeing China's payments for purchases of goods from France and guaranteeing loans from French manufacturers to China. According to well-informed sources, although France has not announced its policy on loans to China, the French government's economic assistance to China with trusted guarantees is already a substantial form of aid. French authorities are currently discussing with the British side the fundraising for the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, giving China a "lifeline" to reach the sea. However, there is currently no accurate information on the exact amount of funds needed to build this railway or the total amount of commercial loans. According to reports from the Chinese community here, the largest transaction between China and foreigners is about to be completed here. It is said that this transaction includes the purchase of a large number of trucks. (Associated Press, 9th)

(Washington) According to official declarations here today, the British loan of a large sum to China is sufficient to help the Chinese side stabilize its currency system and can resist Japan's attempts to devalue Chinese currency in North China and Shanghai. The government believes that although the Japanese side is attempting to undermine the Chinese currency system, the loan obtained by the Chinese side this time is sufficient to stabilize the value of the Chinese yuan indefinitely. Moreover, the British loan this time, in addition to being sufficient to stabilize the Chinese currency system, is also sufficient to promote China's international trade. (Associated Press, 9th)

(London) Since the announcement of the British loan of 10 million pounds to China, the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender against the U.S. dollar has increased by fifteen pence, reaching US$16.15. The Chinese community here believes that after the success of the British loan, all democratic countries related to the Far East will soon have similar economic assistance to China. British figures believe that this action by the British government is a sign of Britain's increasingly tough stance towards the Far East. Although Britain's assistance to China this time is only in supporting China's legal tender, its effect is to thwart the Japanese conspiracy to undermine the credibility of Chinese legal tender. (Associated Press, 9th)

### Ambassador Guo Delivers Remarks; Sincere Cooperation Between China and Britain; Both Countries Benefit

(London) After Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon announced to the House of Commons that the Chinese government had established a currency stabilization fund, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi immediately issued a statement to the press, saying that this move is sufficient to show China's strength, whether in finance, commerce, or territorial administration, it can cope with ease. Britain's cooperation with China further proves that the Western countries are providing China with full and proper assistance, which is the best way to maintain their business and British interests in the Far East. This level has become more and more understood. The British action directly helps China, and at the same time, it is sufficient to prove that the common interests of China and Britain must be maintained. This level will be warmly welcomed by our country, I firmly believe. (Havas, 8th)

### The Main Goal of British Aid to China is to Protect Commercial Interests

(London) After Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon announced to the House of Commons that two British banks would assist the Chinese government in establishing a currency stabilization fund, responsible figures here recently stated that this fund will be established in London and will be operated in the same way as the British Exchange Equalisation Account. The main goal of Britain's support for Chinese legal tender is to protect British business in China and is not limited to protecting financial interests. There is absolutely no unfriendliness towards Japan. If the Japanese government raises objections, it should be answered with this intention. In the past, the Japanese government repeatedly stated that it must maintain Chinese currency in a manner that it deems appropriate. The British government is also eager to maintain Chinese currency in a manner that it deems appropriate to prevent British business from being harmed by currency price fluctuations. In short, Britain's move is within the scope of pursuing a friendly and neutral policy towards China and is not discriminating against Japan. In the future, it may assist China in other ways. (Havas, 8th)

### Britain Has Notified All Relevant Countries of This Plan

(London) All newspapers here have published the announcement of the aid to the Chinese legal tender fund in large print and expressed extreme pleasure and satisfaction, with absolutely no dissenting opinions. Figures in the press and financial circles have all pointed out that the result of the establishment of this fund may prevent Japan from realizing its plan to prohibit Chinese legal tender in North China. It is heard that Chinese troops in North China are paid with funds sent from Chongqing, and although the journey is long and there are difficulties, they can still arrive on time. Therefore, this stabilization fund can even provide assistance to Chinese legal tender in North China through the "back door." Reuters, according to reliable responsible sources, said that the small Chinese exchange stabilization fund used in the past nine months has indeed shown profits in transactions. Therefore, the newly established stabilization fund does not necessarily have to be regarded as necessary to support a falling currency. Before announcing this plan in Congress, the US authorities notified all major foreign governments of the British intentions. It is heard that the British note to Japan on this matter mentioned Japan's previous declaration that stabilizing Chinese legal tender is beneficial to Japan. According to the Financial Times, London business figures are paying attention to the cooperation of all countries with trade and interests in China to prevent the continued threat of turmoil in the Chinese market. American and French merchants are currently maintaining close contact. The newspaper continued that a representative of the Paris Chamber of Commerce attended a meeting of the China Group of the London Chamber of Commerce on Sunday to discuss ways to mutually protect trade and interests in China, which can be used as evidence of the aforementioned cooperation. The concept of providing financial assistance to the Chinese government to prevent Japanese forces from penetrating deeply into China has been universally welcomed. (Reuters, 9th)

### Britain Cannot Turn a Blind Eye to Japan's Attempts in North China

(London) The Times reported that after the announcement of the establishment of the 10 million pound Chinese exchange stabilization fund, Londoners, especially those concerned with trade in China, were very welcome. The Chinese government has received a great deal of assistance from the US Treasury's large purchases of silver. Although the fund can temporarily support the exchange rate, it is widely believed that the export of this silver has gradually decreased recently, and silver reserves have not been as abundant as expected. Under this kind of environment, this stabilization fund is not an urgent necessity, but it can definitely be a very welcome guarantee. What is particularly satisfying is that the Chinese banking community can provide such a large amount for the use of the stabilization fund. This fund is quite large compared to any future demands. The committee that will manage this fund in Shanghai should exercise its power to maintain the stability of the exchange rate or control its exchange rate. The newspaper continued that because there is a possibility of the collapse of the normal institutions of foreign trade in North China, we must pay great attention to Japan's attempts to force the circulation of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes in North China. However, if it is said that the defense of Chinese legal tender will therefore encounter serious problems, then there is no reason. The establishment and operation of this Chinese stabilization fund has absolutely nothing to do with the many financial measures that the Japanese are attempting, and there are also no political purposes. Sino-British commerce has been greatly reduced due to various difficulties. The British government certainly cannot turn a blind eye to serious difficulties in exchange rates and make Sino-British commerce even more affected. From a purely commercial standpoint, helping Chinese legal tender is a policy of a suggestive nature. As for the method of the exchange loan, there is certainly no problem related to China's debt repayment. However, this matter can make the position of the Chinese government more relaxed. What can be hoped for now is that the Chinese authorities, in this changed environment, can at least have a better performance and not make a declaration that they are unable to loan customs duties to repay foreign debts.

### Resistance to Cruel Aggression Arises from Moral Concepts

(London) The "Financial News" editorial today stated that from various points of view, the British government's decision to guarantee the Chinese national currency exchange stabilization fund is welcome. This is indeed pleasing news for British merchants in the Far East and Britons holding Chinese government bonds. The Japanese side cannot have legitimate reasons to criticize this. We must help China to resist arrogant and cruel aggression not only because of our own interests but also because of public morality. The one who gave any real help before was the United States, and the actual contribution of the United Kingdom was limited to purchasing several hundred thousand pounds worth of trucks. It was not until yesterday that there was a constructive step. Since the government feels that this move is appropriate, it should not be interrupted until Britain has exhausted its ability to help China. (Reuters, 9th)

### Strengthening China's War of Resistance is Not Limited to One Way

(London) The "News Chronicle" stated that for the sake of British financial and commercial interests, the stability of the Chinese currency system is absolutely necessary. This is a good reason to help China, but it is not the best reason. For the sake of greater interests, Japan should not be allowed to arbitrarily inflict its brutal attacks on neighboring countries. There is more than one way that Britain can strengthen China's heroic war of resistance, and financial assistance is one of them. It also said that financial assistance should not be limited to this. (Reuters, 9th)

### US Truck Experts Come to the Far East; Will Inspect the New China-Burma Road

(London) The "Daily Telegraph" reported that Hoger, a truck expert from General Motors in New York, recently left London for the Far East with a mission that may affect the future of the Sino-Japanese War. He will inspect the new China-Burma Road to determine which trucks are most suitable for this road and the climate there. (Reuters, 9th)

### The Chinese Government Places a Large Order for Cotton Cloth with Britain; Details of Negotiations Temporarily Not Announced

(London) In the House of Commons today, a member asked the Secretary for Overseas Trade, Mr. Hudson, what steps he is taking to ensure the success of the Chinese government's negotiations with Lancashire merchants to place a large order for cotton cloth. Hudson did not give a specific answer to this question, only saying that he was pleased to know that there had been recent inquiries about placing orders for cotton cloth, but announcing the details would be contrary to the customs of the Department of Overseas Trade. (Reuters, 8th)

### Spokesperson for the Military Council Issues a Report on the Week's War Situation (Continued)

(3) Jiangsu-Shandong Front: Japanese troops in the Linyi, Feixian, and Yizhou areas of southern Shandong, as well as the Zaozhuang area, have begun to stir since last week, fiercely attacking Chinese forces in various parts of northern Jiangsu. Since this week, Japanese troops have invaded in three routes. The central route is advancing from Yaowan towards Shuyang, the right wing is advancing along the Taierzhuang-Suqian highway towards Suqian, and the left wing is advancing along the Linyi-Hai'an highway towards Ganyu. At the same time, they are also landing from the areas of Antongwei in southern Shandong and the Kou of the Guanhe River east of Guanyun, aiming to converge and attack, in an attempt to seize the two Chinese strongholds of Huaiyin and Donghai in northern Jiangsu. Since the 4th, when they occupied Suqian, and the 5th, when they occupied Shuyang, they have repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with Chinese troops in various places such as Yanghe, Siyang, Ganyu, Huaiyin, and Donghai. Chinese troops, relying on strong fortifications, are bravely resisting, and Japanese casualties have been very heavy, with estimated losses of one-third. Currently, powerful units of the Chinese army have been rushed to the front lines to reinforce, and their morale is even stronger. They are launching a multi-pronged counterattack.

(4) Shanxi Front: The war situation is quiet. The Japanese troops in southern Shanxi's Yuci, Yongji, and Fenglingdu have no movements at present. However, the Japanese troops in Fenglingdu occasionally shell the opposite bank, which is a bluffing tactic. A unit of several hundred Japanese troops in Lingshi has been constantly invading eastward for several days. More than 200 of them were killed by Chinese troops in the Zhaojiapu area. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in defeat to Jingsheng to hold on. They are currently being surrounded and attacked, and it will not be difficult to capture them. More than 1,000 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops in Yicheng have been attacking Huayanli village rapidly in recent days. After being ambushed and severely attacked by Chinese troops from the left and right, the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties and have collapsed in defeat. They are currently being pursued by troops. More than 1,000 Japanese troops and five or six artillery pieces in Anyi invaded Guyang village via Xinzhuang on the 1st and 2nd. They were intercepted by Chinese troops and fled in disorder. At present, the Japanese troops are still ambitious and have an attempt to invade Qinshui. On the 1st and 3rd, Chinese troops in western Shanxi successively captured the two important strongholds of Gucheng and Heilongguan, killing more than 500 Japanese troops. When the Japanese troops retreated, they set fire to the villages and towns and raped and killed many women. At this moment, Chinese men and women have unanimously joined the guerrilla forces and are obeying orders to kill the enemy. There are fierce battles to the south of Ningwu and to the north of Jingle in northern Shanxi. The Japanese troops have suffered heavy casualties under the overwhelming firepower of the Chinese troops. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.

(5) Other Fronts: More than 1,500 Japanese troops in Xianxian, Hebei, invaded in two routes at the beginning of this week. Chinese troops attacked them head-on, killing more than 300 Japanese troops. The Japanese troops collapsed in defeat. More than 2,000 Japanese troops in Xiuwu, northern Henan, have launched fierce attacks on Chinese positions twice this week. After being intercepted by Chinese troops, the Japanese troops suffered more than 200 casualties, abandoned more than 100 bodies, and fled north of Xiuwu. Chinese troops took advantage of the victory to pursue and have already approached Xiuwu. The Japanese troops in Beigang, southern Hubei, were pursued by a certain Chinese unit the day before yesterday. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops were defeated and fled towards Tongcheng. The Chinese side then recaptured Beigang. In addition, several hundred troops of the puppet army led by Li Chengpeng stationed in Ezhou and more than 1,000 troops of the puppet army led by Liu Meixi stationed in Xiaogan have successively killed several Japanese advisors this week, carrying the equipment and supplies of their units, and surrendering to the Chinese side. After being reorganized by the Chinese side, this move has dealt a heavy blow to the Japanese army. After all, with the arrogance of the invaders, it can be clearly seen from this end that they are increasingly approaching the end of their rope. (7th telegram)

### Japanese Military Police in Beiping Arrest Workers on a Large Scale

(Beiping) According to news from the police, several Chinese railway workers had a dispute over money. Someone informed the Japanese military police, accusing them of being Communists, resulting in several people being arrested. According to Chinese newspapers, about 100 Chinese Communists were arrested. A railway worker under the command of Li Dade (transliteration), a foreman of the Ping-Sui Railway, was dissatisfied with Li due to a money matter. Two months ago, he informed the Japanese military police, accusing Li of being the leader of the first squadron of a Communist special regiment. Li was arrested by the Japanese military police. A roster was then found in Li's residence, listing the names of those working under him. They were also arrested by the Japanese military police and accused of being Communists. Chinese newspapers also reported that these people had been active in the Beiping area, harassing the Japanese army's rear and sabotaging transportation. However, the newspapers did not mention that they were railway workers. (Reuters, 9th)

### Puppet Regimes in the North and South Negotiate Only on Rice and Coal

(Beiping) According to Chinese newspapers, the negotiations between the "Provisional" and "Reformed" governments to exchange coal produced in North China for rice produced in Central China have made great progress and are expected to reach a compromise. The Coal and Grain Adjustment Committee of the "Ministry of Industry" here has formulated various measures to reduce food and coal prices. For fundamental remedies, the committee has requested the authorities to implement the exchange of rice from Jiangsu and Zhejiang for coal from North China. (Reuters, 9th)

### Japanese Military Police in Tianjin Killed for Opposing the War

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The anti-war sentiment among the Japanese military police in Tianjin is also very strong. Last month, six military police publicly expressed their opposition to the Japanese invasion of China and refuted the Japanese government's cruel remarks. The Japanese authorities heard the news and immediately arrested them. They were executed by firing squad in Tianjin on the 1st of this month. (9th telegram)

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Protection of Forests

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs, stated that with the rapid development of construction in the southwest, the need for timber is increasing day by day. However, there has been a lack of attention to forest logging in the country. The forest management plan submitted by Wang Jiaji, Director of the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the National Academy of Sciences of China, which proposes the supply of timber from various regions and the protection and renewal of forests, definitely has the need to engage in investigation and research. Therefore, he instructed the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Central Research Institute to discuss the promotion of benefits. (Express News Agency, 9th)

### Robbery is Rampant in Guangzhou City

Guangzhou: Shops and hotels here are gradually opening, and although single men are required to register, robbery is still rampant in the city. Even foreign shops located in back streets have been robbed. The robbers are mostly armed and fight with Japanese patrols almost every day. The newly organized Chinese police lack personnel, and only carry wooden sticks when on duty, so they cannot resist the robbers. (Reuters, 9th)

### Coping with Future Emergencies: Britain Strengthens Army Strength; Current Strength: 19 Divisions, 530,000 Men; Training Reserves, Equipping New Weapons; War Minister Reaffirms UK-France Alliance

(London) War Minister Hore-Belisha recently presented the 1939-40 Army budget to the House of Commons, totaling £161,133,000, and delivered a speech explaining the state of the British Army, emphasizing the need for the Army to be deployed to the European continent for combat if necessary. He stated, "The government has decided to intensify the training of reserve forces and equip them with new weapons to be prepared for any future war on the European continent." At that time, the British reserve forces and regular army would immediately merge, but the entire army could not arrive at the battleground simultaneously and would be dispatched to the European continent in batches. Regarding the strength of the British Army, it currently consists of: (1) Six regular divisions, divided into four infantry divisions and two armored divisions; (2) Twelve reserve divisions, divided into nine infantry divisions, two motorized units, and one armored division; (3) Two independent cavalry brigades, along with several independent units below the brigade level, totaling more than nineteen divisions.

In terms of personnel, excluding the garrisons in India and Burma, there are a total of 531,353 officers and soldiers of all ranks, an increase of approximately 83,000 compared to a year ago. Within this fiscal year, an additional 40,000 new recruits will be enlisted into the regular army. As for air defense units, they have been increased from two to five units, and will continue to increase to seven units. The number of anti-aircraft guns in each unit will be increased by 50% to 100% in the next fiscal year, requiring a total expenditure of approximately £30,000.

In addition, to prevent the reduction of the Army's strength, the government has decided to reinforce the personnel of garrisons in overseas territories, so that when war begins, the garrisons in these territories can fully defend themselves effectively. For example, garrisons in Malta, Cyprus, Ceylon, and Singapore will all add local troops. Even in Hong Kong, 1,000 Chinese and Indian soldiers will be recruited. Furthermore, the government has devoted itself to the mechanization of the Army in the past year. Half of the personnel of four regular infantry divisions can now be moved simultaneously with existing transportation. The mechanization equipment of the reserve forces has also been renovated and equipped with new weapons. "The late War Minister Lord Haldane (died in 1928, served as War Minister in 1905) once wanted to form six regular infantry divisions and one cavalry division. Today, our country has an army of nineteen strong divisions. When Lord Haldane was in office, the reserve forces lacked sufficient equipment to cope with war on the European continent. Today's reserve forces are equipped with new weapons. Compared to the past, there has been great progress."

Prime Minister Chamberlain has repeatedly emphasized the joint relationship between Britain and France on December 14th of last year and February 11th of this year. The British Army is now preparing everything to cope with certain emergencies if necessary. Although the UK has not accepted any constraints after talks between the British and French staff, in spirit, it is wise to be prepared." (Havas, 8th)

(London) When British War Minister Hore-Belisha presented the Army budget in the House of Commons today, he addressed the question of to what extent Britain should prepare to send troops to Europe in the event of war and gave a partial answer, saying that this issue required careful study and could only be discussed within the scope of national strategic issues. Prime Minister Chamberlain made a declaration on December 14th of last year, clearly announcing the position that Britain would take in certain situations, leaving no doubt. On February 11th of last year, the Prime Minister reiterated his previous remarks, and stated that he had to explain that the interests of Britain and France were shared, and that any threat to the vital interests of France would immediately trigger British cooperation with France. This statement by the Prime Minister was of greater significance than previous statements. Therefore, Britain must consider the use of the British Army and make preparations in certain situations. Although talks between Britain and France did not bind Britain on this point, those who are deeply thoughtful should take precautions. If Britain joins the war, its contribution and the method of making this contribution must be done with all its strength and not be based on any ideal of limited liability. Britain has made very detailed plans, and Britain has calculated the needs of shipping, as the historical limitations of British troops operating abroad still exist. Every soldier, every artillery shell used, and every vehicle driven must be transported by sea, which means that the entire British army cannot meet the European army on the battlefield at the same time. The talks between Britain and France only involved defensive plans and not aggressive plans. Britain's greatest obligation is now focused on developing a situation that can ensure complete immunity from aggression to the best of its ability. Britain is now determined to achieve this goal.

### British War Minister's Remarks Unanimously Approved by Parliament; The Army Will Be Sent to Europe to Help in Combat If Necessary; The Government's Clear Statement Marks a Beginning

(London) The speech delivered by War Minister Hore-Belisha to the House of Commons, especially the section on training reserve forces to cope with war on the European continent, has caused a major impression. Britain's preparation to assist France on a large scale in times of war can be clearly seen from this. Members of the House of Commons who spoke after War Minister Hore-Belisha all expressed their approval. Even opposition Liberal MP Southby and former Naval Minister Duff Cooper, who are known for opposing the War Minister's current policies, also nodded in agreement. (Havas, 8th)

(London) War Minister Hore-Belisha's speech has been commented on by political figures, who say that War Minister Hore-Belisha's statement that Britain must send troops to the European continent for combat if necessary marks the beginning of the government's public expression of this intention. The statement that the British reserve forces and regular army should immediately merge into one in times of war further demonstrates that Britain has a concrete plan for how it will support France in the future. According to the observations of military experts, the troops that Britain should send to France when necessary are divided into two parts: (1) Three motorized divisions that will depart immediately after the start of the war; (2) Several divisions of reserve forces that will begin training immediately after the start of the war and then depart successively. The reason why War Minister Hore-Belisha issued this statement is that the British arms industry has achieved great results since stepping up production, and the weapons produced are all the latest models. Therefore, this clear statement is made to show that Britain is prepared to cope with war and maintain peace with equal determination. This has been unanimously approved by both the government and the opposition parties domestically, and the repercussions it may cause in France, Germany, and Italy will also be significant. (Havas, 9th)

### Paris Welcomes

(Paris) An official spokesman stated today that France warmly welcomes British War Minister Hore-Belisha's remarks that Britain will send an expeditionary force in the event of a European war, which greatly reduces the worry that France will have to bear the brunt alone for several months after the outbreak of a European war while Britain trains its troops, and can quell calls within France for Britain to adopt a compulsory conscription system. (Reuters, 8th)

### Germany and Italy Pay Attention

(Berlin) People here are paying great attention to British War Minister Hore-Belisha's remarks on the issue of British military intervention in Europe. A political spokesman told a Reuters reporter that what Germany is concerned about is not the number of British troops, but when, where, and under what circumstances they will be deployed. People here regard the British divisions as very formidable troops because they have gained military experience in the colonies. Political circles here are gradually seeing Hore-Belisha as a figure like Roosevelt. (Reuters, 8th)

(Rome) An Italian military expert commented on British War Minister Hore-Belisha's remarks, saying that Italy did not have any special feelings about Britain's war plans, but that discussing this fact was useless. He also said that the German-Italian axis could send around 200 divisions to the battlefield at the start of a major war, and that Italy currently has 10 million people for the organization of around 50 divisions. The remarks of the British War Minister were not published by the official news agency, and the evening newspapers did not disclose them either. (Reuters, 8th)

### US Congressmen Support President's Proposal; Movement to Repeal Neutrality Act Gains Momentum; Freedom to Take Retaliatory Action Against Countries That Breach Agreements and Hinder US Interests

(Washington) The movement in Congress to repeal the Neutrality Act has gained momentum, which is noteworthy because after the Neutrality Act is repealed, President Roosevelt will have more freedom to take retaliatory action against countries that violate treaties and hinder American interests. (AP, 9th)

(Washington) The movement to amend the US Neutrality Act appears to be gaining traction today. After President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the Neutrality Act not only does not help peace but also promotes war, Democratic Senator Lewis today introduced a bill in the Senate to repeal all neutrality-related regulations in federal law so that the government can have more freedom to take retaliatory measures against countries that exclude American commerce and hinder American interests. At the same time, both isolationists and internationalists are supporting Lewis's motion. For example, Republican Senator Johnson stated that he would gladly support any legislative action to repeal the Neutrality Act and expressed surprise at President Roosevelt's previous remarks against the Neutrality Act. (AP, 9th)

(Washington) The issue of amending the Neutrality Act has now become the central issue on the Congressional agenda. If Congress can pass an amendment to extend the "cash and carry" provision to include military supplies, the government would likely be satisfied. However, some people, such as former Secretary of State Stimson, advocate that the US government should openly express its position and support the democratic countries, and they would not be completely satisfied with such an amendment. However, the government's intention is to effectively assist Britain and France in fighting against the dictatorships. It is almost certain that the government will not ask too much as long as the above amendment can be voted and passed by Congress, because after the principle of "cash and carry" is fully implemented, the British and French navies will be able to control maritime traffic and their financial resources will be sufficient to pay for the goods in cash, so they can obtain all the necessary items from the United States without any difficulty, giving them an advantage over the totalitarian states. The current Neutrality Act is scheduled to expire on May 1st of this year, and people close to the State Department and the White House are optimistic about the Congressional discussions. The reasons are: first, President Roosevelt's remarks to the press yesterday that the Neutrality Act does not contribute to world peace have been widely echoed; second, Democratic Senator Barkley of Kentucky made a speech yesterday, strongly arguing that American foreign policy should not only protect American security but also maintain world peace, which was well received by the opposition; third, after Congress passed a portion of the military expansion bill by a large majority, it is evident that a majority of Congressmen are willing to pursue an active foreign policy, thus making it necessary to amend the current Neutrality Act; fourth, former Secretary of State Stimson, a Republican, also sent a letter to the New York Times yesterday, publicly advocating that the United States should take "affirmative action" against fascist countries, thus excluding the issue of foreign policy from domestic political disputes. Based on this, President Roosevelt has gained sufficient support in public opinion and can use the opportunity to amend the Neutrality Act to directly attack the isolationists. (Havas, 9th)

### US-Brazil Talks Conclude

(Washington) Talks between US government representatives and Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha have concluded. The US and Brazil have reached an agreement, and Aranha is scheduled to return home tomorrow. It is reported that in addition to other gains, Aranha has obtained a US guarantee for a loan of £3 million. (Reuters, 9th)

### Japan's Financial Difficulties; Implementation of Inflation; Government Proposes to Parliament; Triple Increase in Paper Money

(Tokyo) The adverse impact of the Sino-Japanese War on the Japanese economy was further demonstrated today. Due to financial difficulties, the Japanese government today submitted a proposal to Parliament to increase the issuance of paper money by the three major Japanese banks by 40% to 60%. That is, the issuance of paper money by the Bank of Japan will be increased from 1.7 billion yen to 2.2 billion yen, the issuance of paper money by the Bank of Korea will be increased from 100 million yen to 160 million yen, and the issuance of paper money by the Bank of Taiwan will be increased from 50 million yen to 80 million yen. The proposal stipulates that this measure will be abolished within one year after the end of the Sino-Japanese War. The proposal was presented in the form of an amendment to the Bank of Japan's issuance limit. (AP, 9th)

### Japan Borrows to Raise War Funds

(Tokyo) The Japanese Minister of the Army reported in Parliament yesterday (8th) that the Japanese government will issue 5.6 billion yen of public bonds in the near future. At the beginning of this year, Japan had already issued 4.1 billion yen of public bonds, of which 3.6 billion yen was used for temporary military spending. It is now reported that the Japanese government plans to issue another 6.8 billion yen of public bonds in the second half of this year to fund the war against China. Since the "China Incident" occurred, the Japanese government has already issued 5.1 billion yen of war bonds. (Express News Agency, 9th)

### Four-Year Production Expansion Plan

(Tokyo) According to Aoki Kazuo, Director of the Japan Planning Department, who stated in Parliament today, after the implementation of the four-year production expansion plan for the "Japan-Manchukuo-China" currency bloc, Japan will be self-sufficient in raw materials such as iron, steel, coal, zinc, railway vehicles, automobiles, ships, as well as light metals, sulfur, wood pulp, ammonia, and soda. According to Aoki, based on 1938, after four years, by the end of 1942, the production of raw materials in the three-nation yen bloc can be increased by the following figures: iron by 250%, steel by 60%, coal by 30%, copper by 80%, lead by 90%, zinc by 70%, natural oil by 30%, chemical oil by 3000%, wood pulp by 20%, wool substitutes by 320%, automobiles by 500%, wool by 340%, locomotives by 30%, railway passenger cars by 70%, railway freight cars by 50%, and gold production by 20%.

### Tokyo to Broadcast Television Films

(Tokyo) According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, the Japan Non-Wire Broadcasting Company will broadcast television from Tokyo in April. This will be the first time in Japan. The broadcaster is a television laboratory in the suburbs of Tokyo. Department stores in central Tokyo and other crowded places will be able to receive these television films. The broadcasting and receiving organization will use Japanese materials exclusively, and its broadcasting machine is a modified version of a film projection organization that can broadcast 25 films per second.

### Soviet Union Actively Prepares for War; Seen from Trade with the United States

(Washington) According to statistics released by the Department of Commerce today, people here believe that the Soviet Union is currently saving its exportable goods in preparation for a possible war. Soviet exports to the United States have greatly decreased, mainly being stockpiled for domestic use and use during wartime. In addition, the total value of Soviet purchases from the United States reached $69,691,100, an increase of 62% compared to US exports to the Soviet Union in 1937. (AP, 9th)

### Soviet Armed Forces Protect Fishing Areas

Hequ, Tianjin News: The Soviet Union, with the fishing season approaching and before the resolution of the Soviet-Japanese fishery disputes, in order to prevent Japanese fishing boats from intruding into the fishing areas, has prepared twelve destroyers, sixty submarines, three submarine motherships, more than twenty armed ships, and more than forty large bombers to deploy to a certain island.

### French Newspaper Reveals News: Hitler Plans to Oppress Britain and France; Plans to Seize the Opportunity to Invade the Borders of the Netherlands and Switzerland; To Use as a Threat for Italian and German Territorial Expansion

(Paris) Pierre Bernus, a diplomatic reporter for the right-wing L'Époque, recently declared, "I have learned about the plan that German leader Hitler intends to implement this year. This plan was originally scheduled to be implemented this month, but there may be a postponement. The main points are as follows: (1) Take preliminary actions in all aspects to weaken the position of the democratic countries of Western Europe, such as the Japanese army occupying Hainan Island, Italy conducting an anti-French propaganda campaign, Italy increasing the number of troops stationed in the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa, the Italian garrison in Italian East Africa putting pressure on the border of French Somaliland, instigating incidents in the Syrian Republic and Palestine, and the Italian army mobilizing. (2) Once the Spanish Civil War ends, Italy should formally make demands on France, and at the same time, Leader Hitler should deliver a speech in support of Italy, and in the form of an ultimatum, make demands for Germany, or even seize and occupy the Netherlands and Switzerland with lightning speed, thereby forcing the democratic countries of Western Europe to immediately yield. However, he should declare that the seizure and occupation of the Netherlands and Switzerland is a temporary measure, and if the Western European countries engage in negotiations at that time, he should make demands on them." (Havas, 8th)

### Italy Plans to Make Four Demands to France

(London) German Aviation Minister and Dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, General Göring, is currently resting in southern Italy. It is reported that before returning to Germany, he will accompany an important Italian figure to France to mediate between France and Italy and present Italy's demands. According to reliable sources in Rome and Berlin, Italy has given up territorial demands on France, and its demands will be limited to the following four items: (1) The legal status of Italian expatriates in French Tunisia in North Africa should be restored to the 1896 system, in other words, these expatriates should enjoy a certain degree of autonomy in Tunisia; (2) The port of Djibouti in French East Africa should be designated as a free port, allowing Italian goods to be imported duty-free, as Hamburg does for Czech goods; (3) Although the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway, built by French merchants, should be jointly managed by France and Italy in the section within French territory; (4) Italy should be allowed to send representatives to participate in the Suez Canal Board of Directors, and the passage fees paid by Italian ships should also be reduced.

Warsaw: Well-informed sources say that Polish authorities hope to start digging a canal connecting the Baltic and Black Seas in the shortest possible time. The canal will pass through the Vistula, San, Dniester, and Prut rivers. A senior official of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gwalewski, recently went to Paris, London, and The Hague, his purpose being to contact the three countries to borrow money in order to realize the project. The Polish authorities also discussed the matter with the Romanian Foreign Minister, Gavrilescu, when he came to visit earlier. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

### Spanish Defense Committee Confident in Its Ability to Quell Unrest; Remnants of the Communist Party Still Hold Out; Government Troops Send Aircraft to Bomb

Madrid: After the Military Committee issued a final ultimatum to the Communist troops today, the Communist troops have now surrendered. Officers of the Republican Army headquarters declared that the situation in the main center of the disturbance is now under control, and there has been little sign of a "war within a war" since this morning. (Reuters, 8th)

Madrid: The local Non-Wire Radio Station recently issued a broadcast message stating that the remnants of the Communist Party are resisting, and the government army has dispatched aircraft to bomb them. (Havas, 9th)

Madrid: The Non-Wire Radio Station affiliated with the National Defense Committee recently issued a broadcast message stating that the remnants of the Communist Party who were resisting surrendered yesterday, but have risen up again today. The National Defense Committee originally wanted to stop the unrest with humane means, but it was ultimately ineffective. In order to maintain the security of the city of Madrid, it has no choice but to use aircraft and artillery to sweep them away. All citizens should know that the National Defense Committee has exhausted all means to advise the Communist Party members to stop fighting, but because the Party is stubborn, it is using force to suppress them. It is estimated that the unrest will be quelled within a few hours. (Havas, 9th)

### The National Education Conference Concludes Yesterday; Passing Chairman Chiang's Address as the Supreme Guiding Principle for Education

(Chongqing) The Third National Education Conference, which began on the 1st, concluded at 3 PM on the 9th, lasting a total of nine days. The conference held ten plenary sessions. The first, second, and third sessions were dedicated to reports on the state of educational facilities from representatives of provincial and municipal education departments and schools. Chairman Chiang also attended the third session on the 4th to deliver an address. The conference discussed proposals, including those submitted by the Ministry of Education regarding improvements to education at all levels, as well as over 300 proposals from various representatives and over 100 suggestions from various parties attending the conference. The conference also passed a temporary motion to adopt Chairman Chiang's address at the conference as the supreme guiding principle for education in China moving forward, truly demonstrating the enthusiasm of all representatives in supporting the leader. At the closing ceremony, Secretary-General of the Conference Zhang Daofan first read the conference declaration, followed by Chairman Chen Lifu's closing remarks, which stated, in essence, that the representatives at this conference provided concrete suggestions for improving education, which will serve as guidelines for future educational implementation and make a significant contribution to national education. The Ministry of Education, during the First National参政會 (National Political Council) Conference, proposed implementation plans for education at all levels for discussion. During the Third National参政會 Conference, the Ministry of Education also presented two plans for educational administration. The improvements to education at all levels submitted by the Ministry of Education at this National Education Conference are concrete measures based on the aforementioned principles. Many valuable suggestions were also made in the various proposals. The resolutions passed will have a significant impact on future educational facilities. The Ministry of Education will make every effort to implement the resolutions and strive to achieve them as soon as possible. Following Vice-Chairman Jiang's speech, President Kong was invited to give instructions, stating in essence that the conference discussed various proposals, including focusing on promoting compulsory education in primary education, emphasizing the implementation of practical work subjects in secondary education, emphasizing student internships in normal education, implementing a tutor system in higher education, and striving for universal sports and military training plans, all of which are significant improvements to education in the future. Regarding educational administration, the government will find ways to reasonably resolve issues such as central subsidies for public education in various regions and enriching library facilities in various schools. Future education should be guided by the Three Principles of the People for revolutionary nation-building, as indicated by the supreme leader. He hoped that everyone would base their efforts on this direction and actively dedicate themselves to the great cause of building the foundation for the war of resistance and national reconstruction. Finally, Chairman Chen gave a response, and the meeting adjourned at 6 PM. (9th dispatch)

### Declaration of the National Education Conference: Raising Academic Standards to Meet the Needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction; Strengthening School Education to Cultivate Social Cadre Talents

(Chongqing) The declaration of the Third National Education Conference is as follows: At a time when the national crisis is urgent and enemy troops are deeply entrenched, the Third National Education Conference is held in Chongqing, the seat of the National Government, to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth review of national education issues and study ways to improve and strengthen it, so as to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. This conference not only recognizes the importance of its mission, but also deeply understands the difficulty of its responsibility. In this period of inconvenient transportation, the members participating are not only from the southwest, but also from the northeast, not only from the front lines of our army, but also from behind enemy lines. The number of attendees at this conference is even greater than the previous two education conferences. This is precisely because we are all driven by a strong national "national consciousness". The nine full days of meetings, sometimes day and night, not only allowed us to fully recognize and discuss many important proposals, but also to listen to and understand the situations in many regions. These reports are not only the knowledge we should have, but also our own education. We have carefully discussed all proposals, and everyone has a spirit of knowing everything and saying everything. When we research and discuss, we dare not let the concept of the needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction and the future of the nation and the people leave our minds. We firmly believe in Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s saying that the foundation of revolution lies in profound knowledge, so we pay great attention to the improvement of higher education. We pay attention to raising academic standards, especially to ensure that science education can be integrated with the great cause of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. General curriculum standards will be revised. In order to equalize the national cultural level, there are regulations on the regional distribution of university education and normal education. In order to promote the training of senior and intermediate technical cadre talents and eliminate the erroneous psychology of social contempt for occupations, it was decided to have a five-year vocational school system for junior high school graduates. Secondary education is the backbone of young people's character and academic development. We have proposed improvement plans that not only focus on the training of vocational and production talents in secondary education, but also take into account the foundation of talent education. Therefore, the six-year unified secondary school system will be given the opportunity for simultaneous experimentation. The appropriate division of secondary school normal and vocational education areas is precisely to avoid the disadvantages of excessive establishment and lack. Elementary schools are the universal foundation of national education. The quality needs to be improved, and the quantity needs to be increased. It is necessary to ensure that all school-age children have elementary schools to attend. The implementation of compulsory education must not be suspended due to the war, and should be actively expanded. Short-term elementary schools are planned to be expanded from a one-year system to a two-year system. The treatment of elementary school teachers should be improved urgently. During the War of Resistance, the consciousness of resistance should be strengthened, and we must give the hard-working people who lost their schooling in childhood extensive educational opportunities. We plan to enrich the facilities of social education and actively promote adult literacy education and electrical education. Art education, which is related to the cultivation of national spirituality, should also be promoted. We must not forget our vast borders. To secure the borders, we must promote the culture of the borders. We must not forget our patriotic compatriots who are saving food and clothing to contribute to the country. We must start by improving the education of overseas Chinese to improve their lives and make them not forget the glorious culture of their motherland. What we are most concerned about are the enemy-occupied areas and the areas behind enemy lines. The youth in our war zones and the compatriots who want to receive national education are suffering greatly from the trampling of the enemy's iron hooves and cannot receive normal national education. We can say responsibly that the country will never forget them. We have plans to actively promote them all. As for the teachers in these areas, especially the arduous struggle of primary and secondary school teachers and their spirit of sacrificing their lives for the country and the nation, we are not only moved, but also worthy of the respect of compatriots across the country. From the perspective of issues related to all parties, we believe that the organization of central and local education administration at all levels should be sound, the efficiency should be improved, the funding should be stable, the curriculum of schools at all levels should be focused, spiritual, and more reasonably coordinated, the facilities of various social education should be appropriately related, the health and nutrition of children and youth should be taken care of, and physical education should be emphasized, so that children and youth are healthy, lively, and enterprising, and the future of the nation will be more hopeful. The Boy Scouts and military training are not only good education for physical training, but also good education for cultivating responsibility, discipline, and all organized life. Military training methods should be improved, and military management must be implemented. The supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, told us, "The new life is the wartime life." If we do not implement wartime life during the war, when should we wait? Everyone knows the importance of teachers, so we must respect teachers, and at the same time, we must cultivate teachers and carefully select teachers, so that the quality of teachers is the backbone of promoting school moral education. The school moral education system must be sound, and those engaged in education are irrefutable truths. As for the protection of teachers at all levels and the opportunities for further study, we believe that they are indispensable conditions for improving teachers. The above is just a large part of the resolutions. We believe that education is not only limited to schools, but is a scope for the entire people. We also believe that there must be sound school education to have sound social cadres. We must all break through the national crisis and establish a strong and unshakable foundation for the country, and we must think about the cause of education, which is a century-long plan. (To be continued) (9th dispatch)

### British-Japanese Negotiations in Hong Kong: Resolution of the Bombing of the Luohu Case; Japanese Text Expresses Apology and Compensates for Losses

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Luohu incident on the Hong Kong-Kowloon border, which attracted worldwide attention, involving the bombing by Japanese aircraft, has been resolved after the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, repeatedly lodged serious protests with the Japanese government, and the Japanese side agreed to apologize and compensate for all damages. British and Japanese sides immediately instructed relevant officials to conduct negotiations near the location of the incident (Hong Kong) to seek a resolution. After receiving this instruction, Ando, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese invasion of South China, dispatched his Chief of Staff, Tanaka, on the 1st from Guangzhou aboard the transport ship Chitose-maru to Hong Kong to formally apologize to the British authorities in Hong Kong for the Luohu incident and to represent the Japanese side in negotiations with the British side. At around 11 AM on the 2nd, Tanaka disembarked from the Chitose-maru and, accompanied by his adjutant, traveled by car to Government House to meet with Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote, offering an apology to the Governor and holding a brief discussion before leaving. He then went to pay respects to Naval Commander-in-Chief Noble and Army Commander-in-Chief McNaughton. At around 1 PM, the British Naval and Army Commanders-in-Chief and the Governor's representative, Smith, also visited the Chitose-maru in return. At 3 PM, Tanaka, representing the Japanese military authorities, went to the Colonial Secretariat to conduct negotiations on the Luohu incident. The British representatives present were Colonial Secretary Smith, Police Commissioner Henry, Director of the British Section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, Walker, and Chief of Staff of the Army Headquarters, Neville. In addition to Tanaka, the Japanese representatives included Consul-General of Japan in Hong Kong, Kotta Takio, Colonel Miyazaki, Lieutenant Colonel Taihei, and Captain Yamada. The negotiations lasted only 40 minutes before concluding. Regarding the content of the negotiations, both the British and Japanese sides maintained strict secrecy, and only after the event did the Hong Kong Colonial Secretariat issue the following announcement: "Lieutenant General Tanaka paid a visit to the Governor this morning, representing Commander-in-Chief Ando, to express his apology for the Luohu incident on February 21st. The Governor replied that he was very grateful for General Ando's dispatch of his Chief of Staff to Hong Kong for negotiations and expressed his satisfaction with the proper handling of this incident by both governments. Regarding the issue of compensation for the loss of British lives and property, consultations were held at the Colonial Secretariat this afternoon." A second announcement was issued later that evening, stating in essence that "the Japanese text has agreed to the compensation for losses, with a maximum amount of 20,000 yuan." On the morning of the 3rd, British and Japanese representatives held a second round of negotiations on the British warship "HMS Dauntless". The representatives present from both sides remained the same. The negotiations began at 10:30 AM and lasted until 11:30 AM, lasting one hour. After this round of negotiations, the so-called Luohu incident can be considered to have come to an end. As for the content of this negotiation, both sides remained silent. However, according to sources familiar with the matter, in addition to discussing how to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, it also involved general issues between Britain and Japan in South China, such as the opening of trade. However, it was also heard that the negotiations on this point did not yield much results. At this point, the Luohu incident, which caused a sensation in the Far East for a time, was completely resolved. The Japanese representatives and the British authorities exchanged courtesies, while sending telegrams to their respective governments for instructions. Once their respective governments have replied, both sides can formally sign the agreement. Therefore, Japanese Chief of Staff Tanaka left Hong Kong on the 6th aboard the Chitose-maru and returned to Guangzhou.

### The Trial of the Lin Baisheng Assault Case Opens in Hong Kong; Defendant's Attitude is Relaxed

Hong Kong Correspondence: The Lin Baisheng assault case has officially begun its public trial at the Central Magistracy in Hong Kong. At around 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, the atmosphere in the Central Magistracy's courthouse was already tense, with a continuous stream of people arriving to observe the proceedings. The trial began at 2:30 PM. Lin Baisheng, accompanied by two burly men providing protection, arrived at the court. On that day, Mr. Lin wore a navy blue silk cotton robe, a black French-style cap, and glasses on his nose, and walked slowly with a cane in his hand. The defendant was a painter named Chen Xilin, whose attitude was relaxed and showed no signs of fear. At the start of the trial, the judge first stated the cause of the case, followed by Dr. Gurney of the Maryknoll Hospital, who took the stand to testify about the extent of Lin Baisheng's injuries. Then, the judge questioned Lin Baisheng. Lin testified that he was the founder of the Nan Hua Daily News on Hollywood Road and currently serves as the general manager of the newspaper. On January 17th of this year, at 5:00 PM, he was descending from the Chung Tin Hong building when, as he stepped out of the arcade onto the road, he suddenly felt someone attacking him from behind and from both sides. He quickly continued for a few steps before collapsing. He vaguely recalled that someone had touched his eyes and felt blood flowing out. He heard a Western woman shouting "Ambulance!" and then became unclear. As for the felt hat presented in court today, it was the one he was wearing at the time of the incident, but it was quite intact at the time and not torn. He had never met the defendant standing in the dock and did not recognize him. After Lin Baisheng finished his testimony, Dr. Hua of the Maryknoll Hospital's electrotherapy room took the stand to testify. Dr. Hua happened to witness Lin being knocked down that day, but could not identify the assailant. At this point, the presiding judge announced that the trial would be postponed until 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 6th of this month for further questioning. As for the defendant Chen Xilin, who is twenty-seven years old and from Guangdong, he faces two charges: 1. Assaulting Lin Baisheng on January 17th with intent to murder; 2. Assaulting Lin Baisheng with intent to cause bodily harm. As for the injuries sustained by Lin Baisheng at the time, there were a total of six locations: three on the back of his head, one on the outer corner of his right eye, and two on his head. The wound on the outer corner of his right eye was the largest.

### Construction Department Stipulates Implementation Steps: Fujian Province Repairs Inland Water Conservancy; Dredging of Shoals Between Yong'an and Qingliu Completed; Water Diversion for Wasteland Reclamation to Commence Soon

Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian Province, bordering the sea in the southeast, is located on the front lines of national defense. The northwest is mountainous, making production and transportation extremely inconvenient. In order to actively promote local production and construction and enhance the province's economic strength, the Provincial Construction Department is focusing on inland self-repair water conservancy and farmland water conservancy projects, as well as blasting open dangerous river shoals, in order to facilitate transportation and make agriculture more prosperous. Since the beginning of July 27th, although the progress of water conservancy projects has been limited by financial resources and has not been perfect, there have been considerable achievements. Here is a summary of the progress made by the construction authorities: (1) Farmland water conservancy projects: The counties of Yong'an, Liancheng, Nanping, Shaxian, and Jian'ou have begun construction. The implementation method is based on the suitability of the terrain and water flow, and investigations are carried out. In Ansha, Yong'an, dikes are built to prevent flooding and reclaim wasteland. In Gekou, Liancheng, Shuidong, Shaxian, Yanxi Chiling, and other places, water diversion is used to reclaim wasteland. In Chuyang, Nanping, dikes are built and water is diverted to irrigate fields. In Fengle, Jian'ou, water is stored to reclaim wasteland. In Qixing Street, Jian'ou, and Baxiang Township, Nanping, mechanical irrigation methods are used. Farmland water conservancy supervisory offices have been established in various places, and special commissioners are assigned to be responsible for guidance and management. At the same time, outstanding farmers' children are recruited in various counties to set up classes to train farmland water conservancy technology to enrich the supervisors of farmland water conservancy projects. All projects are handled by laborers in various counties. As for other counties, survey teams are also being assigned one after another to conduct surveys first for design purposes. (2) Shoal blasting engineering method: All blasting has been completed in six Longtan shoals between Yong'an and Qingliu, and the Jianshi Andan shoal. The work in progress includes the Tanxi shoals in the Qingliu and Songxi rivers, and the Duohua Qigu Longtan, Tai Ninglu Jie shoal, which have now been surveyed and can be blasted soon. After completion, shipping will be more convenient. (3) Embankment gate project: The construction of the embankment gate project in Marong Township, Minhou has been completed. The repair of the embankment after the flood in Longxi Tianzhen has also begun. The construction of the dam in Fuqing Yangdan has been largely completed, and personnel have been sent to handle the completion. (4) Other engineering aspects: (A) Chang Lezhu irrigation field office, opened the Guantianyang waterline, added water restriction projects, and repaired the right-line canal, and added wood piles to protect the embankment; (B) dredging of the Minjiang River downstream Beigang Mawei and Gu Shan straight dam, the front-line port project in front of the third lighthouse; (C) continued dredging of the Minjiang River downstream Beigang waterway; (D) Taining Reclamation Office to handle wasteland water diversion projects, all Chennei, Dabu, Dian Shang, Meikou, He Shang, Pai Er, Wang Wan, and other places have been completed by the first survey team. Design completion, construction can be started soon. Checking the setting of gates and building dams, blasting shoals and digging ports are the four methods of sorting out waterways. The Minjiang River's three major streams have dangerous waterways and difficult freight transportation, so the local agricultural products cannot flow smoothly. The sorting out of waterways is a matter of urgency. Since the war began, the government has actively promoted land reclamation for the sake of increasing food production. Fujian is a province with insufficient food, and land reclamation work is especially urgent. In order to seek the success of reclamation, it is necessary to develop water conservancy for agricultural land first, otherwise, it will inevitably be plagued by water and drought disasters, which will be laborious and fruitless. Now that the Construction Department has actively carried out the two tasks of waterway rectification and farmland water conservancy, and has achieved considerable results, it is hoped that it can raise more funds in the future and carry out this project to the end.

### Wang Naicang Deeply Regrets His Past Mistakes; Suzhou Puppet Police Defect

Suzhou Correspondence: Wang Naicang, captain of the 5th Company of the 2nd General Police Force of the puppet Jiangsu Province, previously served as the captain of the Jiading County Security Force. After the Chinese army moved west, he was forced to surrender temporarily due to the cutting of his return route. He stationed his subordinates in Xiyongchang, Suzhou. Recently, due to the increasing suffering of the people in Suzhou, he deeply regretted his past mistakes. On the 5th of this month, he led his troops to defect. He secretly requested Commander Xiong of Changshu to send personnel to count the guns and equipment of his unit. Therefore, the Japanese army has been heavily guarded outside Suzhou city in recent days.

### Finance Greatly Improved; Zhejiang in the Midst of Recuperation and Education; Huang Shaohong Speaks in Guilin

Guilin Correspondence: History tells us that Zhejiang has always been a base for revenge and revitalization of the country. Anyone who has dabbled in ancient Chinese history will be able to tell the story of the rise and fall of Wu and Yue. Under the great pen of historians, this story constitutes the greatest and most perfect textbook of the nation and the country, which has been used by oppressed nations and countries in the universe for thousands of years as a lesson for the future.

Since the Japanese swept through the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou triangle on the East battlefield, and the Chinese have held firm on the south bank of the Qiantang River, more than a year has passed. During this period, the Japanese initially entered a state of semi-sleep in this aspect of the war due to strategic relations, and finally due to insufficient strength. The Chinese side took the opportunity to reorganize its troops, recuperate, and educate, just like the Yue Kingdom when Goujian was released from the vicinity of the Gusu Terrace. At that time, the Yue Kingdom's territory stretched from Haikou in the north to Gumo (Chongxian) in the south, from Gou Yong (East China Sea) in the east to Zui Li (Jiaxing) in the west. This territory of 800 miles in length and breadth is also equivalent to the current Ｘ war zone's positions and guerrilla areas in Zhejiang. The Japanese situation and the Chinese countermeasures are even more in line with what Fan Li said to Goujian: "To plan for the country to defeat the enemy, observe its signs. Now Wu is using the power of the princes to command the world, but they do not know that their virtue is thin and their grace is shallow, their path is narrow and their grievances are wide, their power is suspended and their wisdom is declining, their strength is exhausted and their power is broken, their soldiers are frustrated and their troops are retreating, and their people are scattered. I ask Your Majesty to press our troops and reorganize them, and wait for their defeat to attack them. Without bloodshed, Wu's monarch and ministers will be prisoners. I wish Your Majesty to hide your voice and not see your movements, but to observe their stillness." When the author visited Huang Shaohong, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in Guilin and talked about Zhejiang's provincial administration, I became more excited about this historical fact.

Although King Goujian of Yue's sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, deep planning, and accumulation of efforts were one of the reasons for destroying Wu and restoring the country, if he did not have Fan Li, who was "clear and knew the inside", and Wen Zhong, who was "far-sighted and saw the outside", to give him great assistance in politics, then it would be difficult for anyone to give a definite answer as to whether King Fuchai of Wu would agree to his "bare shoulders and kneeling". Therefore, winning the political victory is a prerequisite for winning the military victory. Although Zhejiang is far behind the Japanese, it is in danger of being surrounded and attacked by the Japanese, but it also has the convenience of rising up to attack and succeeding in one fell swoop. Huang Shaohong used to be in charge of internal affairs, and now he is in charge of Zhejiang. His hard work and practical spirit have long been watched by all parties. From his speech, we can not only understand the current situation in Zhejiang, but also seek signs of the future.

The politics of Zhejiang Province is progressing with the evolution of the situation. At present, the provincial administration is advancing towards the following six goals: (1) self-defense mobilization, (2) military service, (3) financial mobilization, (4) improving rural institutions, (5) adjusting products, and (6) controlling transportation. "Self-defense mobilization" is to mobilize armed people and make the people automatically arm themselves, to defend villages, towns, counties, and regions in a passive way, and to directly participate in the war of national liberation in an active way. Now, in addition to the self-defense forces of villages, towns, and counties in Zhejiang, each county and region has a self-defense regiment, which can already be used centrally. Although this inevitably increases the burden on the people slightly, it has gained the understanding of the public. This huge popular armed force is the vanguard of sweeping away in the future counter-offensive.

The slogan of financial mobilization is "give money if you have money," but it does not necessarily mean asking someone to give money. The rich areas of Zhejiang are in Jiahu Hangfu. Since they were captured one after another, these 13 fallen counties, although only accounting for a little less than one-sixth of the province's 75 counties, must be said to be a very large loss in Zhejiang's financial budget. After a period of reorganization, such as eliminating corruption and increasing consumption tax rates, fiscal revenue has increased by one-fifth compared to the original revenue. Therefore, Zhejiang has a budget that has never exceeded 30 million yuan in previous years, and this year it has jumped to more than 40 million yuan. This financial miracle is enough to give a demonstration to the financial authorities of various provinces. At the same time, it tells the Chinese people that China's finances are not "there is no way," but "there is no way to do it."

The most noteworthy is the work of "improving rural institutions". The governments of each district and county in Zhejiang Province are now attached with "Political Work Guidance Offices", training university or middle school graduates to engage in publicity to the public, explaining and promoting the work of government decrees. Their position is between the government and the people, as a medium between the government and the people. At present, there are no fewer than 4,000 people working in various districts and counties in the province. On average, there are two political workers for every 10,000 people in Zhejiang. Their working principle is "centralized application" and "responsible in districts". They work for three weeks a month and train for one week, which is constantly learning, working, experimenting, and improving. It can be said that it is the best education method and working method. The port of Wenzhou has not been blocked by the Japanese and is now the only route for coastal trade and transportation. Daily necessities imported into the interior via this route from Shanghai via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway are very crowded. In the past, there were unavoidable Japanese goods that were repackaged and labeled. Those who transported them to the interior for profit now have seven checkpoints between Wenzhou and Jinhua that specialize in inspecting these Japanese goods. If they are found, they will be confiscated.

### The Desolation of Xuzhou: Puppet Officials Don Their Guises; Rampant Banditry in Southern Xuzhou

Xuzhou Dispatch: Xuzhou was originally formed by the merger of Tongshan and Xiaoxian counties, hence its vast jurisdiction. It occupies a strategic position on the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways and has historically been an important military town. Since its fall last year, the devastation it has suffered is no less than that of Nanjing and Zhenjiang. To this day, the market is depressed. Datong Street and Gongming Street were once the most prosperous areas in the county, with various shops lined up closely, but now they are a scorched wasteland. The South Gate and Horse Market Street still have some semblance of a market, mostly small restaurants and grocery stores. Cigarettes are nowhere to be found; most people smoke native tobacco. Smuggled goods are everywhere. Military scrip and the Central China United Bank's banknotes fly around, but the people refuse to use them. The Bank of Korea recently set up an office in Xuzhou. The puppet Xuzhou Public Security Maintenance Association, instigated by the Japanese, and the maintenance associations of various counties under Xuzhou are also under its control. It was then reorganized into a puppet Xusi Special Zone Commissioner's Office, abolishing the traditional New Year's Day and officially establishing a puppet provincial office in Xuzhou. The puppet office head is Li Haichun, the secretary-general is Wang Xianglin, the head of the civil affairs section is Su Genian, the head of the finance section is Zhang Liguang, the head of the culture and education section is Zhou Zhiye, and the head of the construction section is Liu Zhenwu. The advisor is Cao Ziqing. The puppet mayor of Xuzhou Municipal Government is Zhang Yunsheng, the advisor is Yang Shilan, the secretary-general is Xu Huibo, the head of the first section is Wang Jiasheng, and the head of the second section is Zhang himself. The municipal government has four bureaus under it. The puppet police chief is Yang Shixu. There are also finance and public works bureaus, but the head of the finance bureau has not yet been appointed. Tongshan County Public Office was also carved out and established, with Li Haichun as the puppet magistrate, and Wang Shaoqing and Zhang Weiru as puppet section chiefs. Zhang Guishan is the head of the political police team, and Xie Shoushan is the head of the Xuzhou Security General Corps. The puppet judicial organs, originally the Xuzhou Civil Tribunal, have now also been changed to the puppet Tongshan County Court, with Wang Ruisheng as the puppet president. Generally, all the big and small puppets are celebrating their promotions. The puppet district offices and township offices have also been established. The people suffer from the exploitation and oppression of the puppet government and live in dire straits, unable to see the light of day. In the area bordering Xuzhou and Xiao, and in the southern part of Xuzhou, including Xulou, Qingshishan, and other large and small villages, banditry is exceptionally rampant. Although the puppet security corps has three to four thousand people, their weapons are poor and they dare not leave the city to suppress the bandits.

### Chen Lijiang Discusses China's Education Over the Past Year (I): The Misfortunes of the Cultural World Are Unbearable to Recall, But There Is Hope for the Revival of New Education in the Future

(Chongqing Dispatch) Mr. Chen Lijiang, Director of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, recently discussed China's education over the past year. He spoke in great detail about the various ways in which China's education has been devastated by the invaders over the years, as well as the Ministry of Education's various plans and implementations for renovating education after the war. Here is a record of it (the following is all in Mr. Chen's words):

China in the past year has been continuing the struggle against the invasion of the tyrannical enemy, and fighting even more bravely and resolutely. In China, which has undergone such a process, everything is changing rapidly, and therefore her education is no exception.

Looking at the enemy's destruction of our education, China's education this year is truly unbearable to witness and even more unbearable to speak of. This year, in our Great Rear Area, the enemy, based on its consistently vicious policies, has airplanes bombing wildly every day, and educational and cultural institutions are, as usual, one of their main targets for bombing. The areas bombed include not only educational and cultural institutions in Central China, such as Huachung University in Wuchang, but also educational and cultural institutions in South China, such as National Sun Yat-sen University. Not only were coastal educational and cultural institutions such as Xiamen University bombed, but also educational and cultural institutions in Central China such as Hunan University. Not only were educational and cultural institutions near the war zone bombed, but also Kunhua Normal School in Yunnan, far in our southwestern frontier. The means of bombing are even more brutal than in the previous year. For example, the bombing of Hunan University involved twenty-seven airplanes, divided into three teams, invading the skies above Mount Yuelu and densely dropping forty to fifty bombs, many of which were incendiary bombs, causing the entire library of Hunan University to be destroyed, two-thirds of the science building to be destroyed, and three student dormitories to be destroyed. What remained were only broken walls and ruins, and the essence of the entire school was reduced to ashes. The loss of one school is like this, so the losses suffered by the various cultural institutions from Central China to South China, from the coast to the central region, and from the war zone to the frontier, cannot be measured.

Even educational and cultural institutions in the rear area, far from the war zone, have been subjected to such crazy bombing by the enemy, so it is not difficult to imagine the depth and magnitude of the destruction of educational and cultural institutions in and near the war zone this year. Especially when we have to voluntarily abandon a certain stronghold for strategic reasons, the local education is completely destroyed, either by setting fire to the schools, such as Hangzhou Jianwu Middle School, burning them all to ashes, or by setting fire to the libraries, such as the Zhejiang Provincial Library, burning them all to ashes, or by massacring our school teachers and students, such as the murder of Zhao Tianlin, the principal of Tianjin Yaohua Middle School, and the assassination of Liu Zhanen, the president of Shanghai Hujiang University, which are just obvious examples. There are countless other intellectuals who have been massacred that have not been recorded in the newspapers and that we do not know about. The school buildings that were fortunate enough not to be burned down by the enemy were also occupied by the enemy as military camps, such as the various colleges and dormitories of National Peking University, which, according to reports, have become the enemy's stables and military camps. The books and instruments that were fortunate enough not to be burned down by the enemy were also smuggled back to their country by the enemy, or sold to shops for a few copper coins a bag to be used as leather bags, or burned as firewood at will. As for the teachers and students who withdrew from our war zone, the hardships they suffered along the way from wind, frost, hunger, and cold, displacement, loss of schooling, and loss of teaching cannot be described in words.

However, the deepest and greatest pain is above bombing, destruction, burning, and killing, and that is the implementation of incomparably vicious enslavement education in the occupied areas. We are not afraid of bombing because if the old is destroyed, the new will grow out of it. We are not afraid of destruction because the more we are destroyed, the stronger and more solid we will become. However, enslavement education is terrible, too terrible. It is something that kills without drawing blood. A son or daughter of the Chinese nation is finished if he or she is bewitched and anesthetized by enslavement education. Not only is he or she finished, but he or she will also become the enemy's beasts of burden and the enemy's running dogs. He or she will no longer hear the call of the motherland, no longer know the history of his or her own nation, recognize the thief as his father, and act as an accomplice of the tiger without knowing it. A nation is not afraid of being conquered by others militarily, but when it is conquered by others educationally and culturally, it can only be treated as human flesh on the chopping block, and we as fish to be slaughtered. The enemy has already begun to do this work in our occupied areas. For example, on April 4 of last year, various newspapers reported that the enemy, in our occupied areas, in addition to massacring our children, also captured them for education, in preparation for continuing their aggression in the future. The enemy even had the far-fetched idea of sending Gu Zhengzhi, the former ambassador to Austria, to Shanghai to preside over the motherland education, setting up education on the spot to avoid the labor of carrying them away to raise them. According to the story of the ancient cultural city reported by the Beiping News, and the report on the enslavement education in North China under the iron heel by the Tianjin News, it is terrible to say. To sum up the steps taken by the enemy to implement enslavement education in the occupied areas, the first step is to search (National cultural organs in Beiping), the second step is to burn and ban all kinds of books and newspapers related to our national consciousness, and to massacre our intellectuals, the third step is to recruit the scum among our intellectuals (for example, the enemy and puppets ostentatiously published an announcement in the Shanghai News about the joint office of various schools and colleges in Tianjin and Shanghai, registering the faculty and students of various schools and colleges in Tianjin who were exiled in Shanghai), and to train them in traitorous theories, the fourth step is to revise textbooks and curricula, deleting all the teaching materials about the Three People's Principles and national thought from our original textbooks, advocating the anesthetizing nature of reading the classics, and listing Japanese language as a compulsory subject, and the fifth step is to rebuild schools, recruit students, and implement enslavement education. In addition, they also advocated the softening and anesthetizing nature of the "Chinese Buddhist Association," founded various traitorous newspapers, suppressed foreign-run schools in China, carried out the absurd propaganda of "Wangdao Paradise" and "East Asian New Order," and deprived the people in our occupied areas of freedom of publication, assembly, association, and so on. The enemy's intention is nothing more than to use the tool of enslavement education to eliminate the national consciousness of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, to make each and every descendant of the Yellow Emperor thoroughly become a docile citizen of the Japanese Empire, no, to be cows, horses, and slaves, and to have you be cannon fodder to kill your own brothers.

In summary, from the perspective of the enemy's destruction, China's education this year has not only suffered great damage from the Japanese invaders, causing great pain and depth, but has also been greatly manipulated by the Japanese invaders, which is shocking.

From the perspective of our creation, China's education this year is the most commendable and the most exciting. China's past education had unclear goals, uncertain policies, complex theories, and divergent ideas. However, during this year, these shortcomings have been completely changed. In terms of educational goals, regardless of the government or the public, there is a unanimous direction towards forging loyal and brave soldiers for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, fighting the war while building the country. In terms of educational policies, Minister Chen has repeatedly declared that the three educations must advance in parallel, that literature and martial arts must be combined, that agriculture and industry must be given equal importance, that the educational goals must be consistent with the political goals, that family education must be closely linked with school education, that the essence of our country's inherent culture, which is embodied in literature, history, philosophy, and art, must be reorganized and promoted with scientific methods in order to establish national self-confidence, that natural sciences must be caught up with according to needs in order to meet the urgent needs of national defense and production, that social sciences must learn from the strengths of others and make up for our own shortcomings in order to seek everything that is suitable for the national conditions, that education at all levels must strive for clear goals and seek balanced development in various regions, that compulsory education must be popularized according to the original deadline, and that social education and family education must strive for planned implementation. The Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction also has the following provisions: (29) Revise the education system and promote wartime curriculum, focusing on the cultivation of national morality, improving scientific research, and expanding its equipment. (30) Train various specialized technical personnel and assign them appropriately to meet the needs of the War of Resistance. (31) Train young people to serve in the war zone and rural areas. (32) Train women to serve in social undertakings to increase the strength of the War of Resistance. Based on this policy, the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang also passed a general outline of the wartime implementation plan for education at all levels (to be continued).

### Difficult Fundraising for Educational Expenses: Satisfactory Results; Exceeding 100,000 Yuan When the Ten-Day Deadline Expires; Schools Urged to Remit Donations Immediately

The Fundraising Committee of the Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association launched a fundraising campaign for the production and education expenses of refugees by promoting the sale of "Charity Badges." Starting on the first of this month, today is the last day. The cultural and educational circles of the city have been enthusiastically promoting it, and people from all walks of life have been actively donating. The results have been excellent. It is reported that the predetermined target of more than 100,000 yuan has been exceeded, and people from all walks of life continue to donate to the Bank of Shanghai to receive the badges. The association originally stipulated that if schools had surplus Charity Badges, they should return them to the association on the 9th. However, because the schools had to compete for the efforts of the last day, they mostly requested an extension until the 11th to return them. Yesterday, many schools applied to continue to receive Charity Badges. The association hopes that the donations raised by the schools will be remitted to the Bank of Shanghai immediately after the end of today for statistics, and to be used as a basis for awarding prizes, it is said.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Education Subsidy: 220,000 Yuan; The Approved Amount for This Year Increased by 60,000 Compared to Last Year

When the Shanghai Municipal Council held a regular meeting on the 8th of this month, it was resolved to allocate 220,000 yuan for subsidies to Chinese schools and 190,000 yuan for subsidies to foreign schools, as proposed by the Education Committee. The amount of this subsidy is more than that issued last year (the total amount last year was 160,000 yuan) because the number of students in each school was smaller last year.

### YMCA Relief for Impoverished University and Middle School Students; More Than 500 Students Received Assistance

The Shanghai YMCA has organized the Shanghai Student Relief Committee to help impoverished students, with Yang Yongqing, Miao Qiusheng, Zhu Peisi, Li Denghui, and others as committee members. They provide material assistance to general impoverished students who are determined to study and have a hardworking spirit. Students can apply regardless of religion or gender. After the association's strict review and testing, it can be approved. University students are limited to 50 yuan per person, and middle school students are limited to 30 yuan per person. More than 500 students have received assistance. According to the association, it subsidized approximately 11,000 yuan to students who received subsidies from the association during the summer and autumn of last year, totaling more than 500 people.

### Soochow University's Negotiations with the Japanese Side End; Regains Management Rights of School Buildings; The School Buildings of Jinghai, Xiuzhou, and Hugun Can Be Returned to Their Original Owners Within Two Weeks

The Continental News reports that yesterday (the 8th), it was learned that the 17-month-long dispute between the original American owners of Soochow University in Suzhou and the Japanese side has now ended. Today (the 9th), they will regain management of the school buildings, which are worth one million yuan. Jinghai Women's Normal School in Suzhou, Xiuzhou Middle School in Jiaxing, and Hugun Women's School in Huzhou, all of which were established by Americans, are also expected to be returned to their original owners by the Japanese army within two weeks. A five-person committee representing Soochow University and its administrator, the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church of America, went to Suzhou last week to reclaim the property. The school was forcibly occupied when the Japanese army entered Suzhou. The school authorities, the church, and the American government have repeatedly made requests, but the Japanese army ignored them and continued to occupy the property. However, the Japanese army has repeatedly allowed school personnel to transport out the school's equipment. Among the items that have been transported out are thousands of volumes of books and a large amount of scientific equipment. The five-person team is led by Dr. Shang Si, the acting president of the school, and is expected to return to Shanghai on Saturday or Sunday. Soochow University was established by the American Methodist Episcopal Church in 1903. Shortly after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the school moved from Suzhou to Tunxi, Anhui Province. Before classes could begin, the Japanese army had already invaded Anhui Province. Hundreds of faculty and students of the school moved to Shanghai and started classes in the Cishu Building with St. John's University, Jiang University, and Hujiang University. Dr. Yang Ge, the president of Soochow University, is now in the United States and is scheduled to return to Shanghai in early autumn to take office. Because the current situation in the Suzhou area is unstable, the school is not expected to use its original Suzhou site for some time to come.

Patriotic students should wear Charity Badges

### Western Union Football Referees Announced This Week

The final of this Scott Cup Football Tournament, Lido vs. West Capture, is scheduled to take place tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium. Lido's forwards are sharp, and West Capture's defense is strong. There should be a fierce battle at that time. It is generally not a problem for Lido to win the championship. Although West Force's strong player McKellen has now transferred to West Capture, he is not included in the lineup for this battle. According to Mr. Dickson, the manager of the team, McKellen could have played in this game after transferring to West Capture, but it seemed unfair to add new players at the last moment. Therefore, it was decided to fight with the original team. The charity game the day after tomorrow, Donghua vs. Portugal, and the Zilin Cup quarter-final, French Army vs. North West Children, are also scheduled. In addition, there are eight other league games this week. The Hua team (Group A) will face West Force, the reserve team Donghua will meet St. Francis, and the Group B Qinghua will meet the British Navy. The appointment of referees for each game is as follows:

### Finance Severe Foreign Exchange Selling Occurs Due to the Establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund

Foreign Banks and Exporters Frequently Sell Heavily, the "North China Puppet Bank" Also Cuts Significantly

Yesterday, the exchange market experienced a sharp sell-off due to news reports that the Sino-British financial loan plan had been established. Foreign firms from Hong Kong, Sassoon, and Chinese firms like the Sha Hua gang aggressively sold large quantities. The "North China Reserve Bank" also aggressively cut its positions. In addition, foreign banks had weak appetites, so the market loosened considerably. However, Sassoon suddenly stopped selling and started buying, causing the situation to tighten briefly. Ultimately, demand could not keep up with supply, and the market could not sustain itself for long. In the end, both British and American exchange rates continued to soften, and trading was very active. As for the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, foreign banks and exporters were also aggressively selling, and foreign firms had weak appetites, so the downward trend was also severe, breaking through the 55-yuan mark.

In the early morning, London telegraphic transfers for both near and far dates were flat. New York silver prices and London gold prices also remained unchanged. In foreign exchange, the British pound depreciated against the US dollar by 1.2%, appreciated against the French franc by a small amount of 0.03, and appreciated against Shanghai by 0.0625. The US dollar appreciated against the British pound by 1.25%, appreciated against the French franc by a large amount of 0.0625, and appreciated against Shanghai by 0.15 yuan. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 8 shillings 2 1/875 for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous closing, both British and American exchange rates remained unchanged. After opening, foreign firms from Sassoon, Hong Kong, and Chinese firms like the Sha Hua gang rushed to sell aggressively, and banks' appetites were weak. As a result, the underlying trend was quite soft and cheap. Sassoon, Hong Kong, and the Sha Hua gang sold British pounds to Maccaroli, HSBC, and another bank, with the rate hardening from 8 shillings 2 5 to 3125. Subsequently, Sassoon, foreign telegrams, and Chinese firms also sold US dollars to HSBC and another bank, with the rate falling from 16.1875 yuan to 25. HSBC's listed prices and the announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Afterwards, Sassoon suddenly stopped selling aggressively and started buying, causing the situation to reverse and tighten. Sassoon bought British pounds from foreign banks, with the rate returning from 8 shillings 2 8125 to 21875, and US dollars from 16.1875 yuan to 0625. Later, telegrams from Hong Kong resumed selling, causing the market to soften and cheapen again. Hong Kong telegrams sold British pounds to HSBC for 8 shillings 2 8125. Later, telegrams also sold US dollars to HSBC and another bank for 6.1875 yuan. Near noon, a foreign bank, Anda, also sold Hong Kong dollars to a foreign firm for 95.125 yuan, so the process was also hard. At noon closing, bank selling prices were 8 shillings 2 8125 for the British pound and 16.1875 yuan for the US dollar.

In the afternoon, telegrams from Hong Kong continued to sell aggressively. In addition, the Tianjin gang ("North China Joint Reserve Bank," etc.) cut their positions at a loss, and Chinese banks also rushed to sell. As a result, the underlying trend became even softer and more flooded. Chinese banks and large Tianjin gangs sold British pounds to HSBC, Dutch Bank, and Anda, with the rate rising from 8 shillings 2 3125 to 34375. Subsequently, a foreign firm bought British pounds from HSBC for 8 shillings 2 325, and also bought US dollars from a foreign bank for 16.25 yuan. Later, the Chinese Sha Hua gang again sold US dollars to a Chinese bank for 16.3125 yuan. Finally, a Chinese bank bought Hong Kong dollars from an exporter for 55.75 yuan. As a result, the situation remained soft. At the evening closing, bank selling prices were 8 shillings 2 34375 for the British pound and 16.3125 yuan for the US dollar. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the British pound softened by 125, the US dollar hardened by 25, and the Hong Kong dollar also softened by 1 yuan, reaching 55.75 yuan.

### Sino-British Establishment of Exchange Equalization Fund

Domestic debt rises by about one yuan; foreign debt rises more substantially, ranging from two or three pounds to one pound.

"Cooked red" drops by thirty-seven yuan, closing at two thousand and ninety-eight yuan.

The British pound rises by 125, to 8 shillings 2 34375; the US dollar rises by 25, to sixteen yuan three one two five.

British banknotes fall by five jiao and five fen; the British pound falls by six jiao; American banknotes fall by one jiao and two fen; and the American gold pound falls by five jiao.

However, peanut oil, due to Japanese puppet control, requires that drafts be sold to Japanese puppet banks starting tomorrow, causing a sharp increase of four yuan.

### Bullishness Lacking Interest, Cash Falls Expand, Breaking the Two Thousand One Hundred Yuan Mark, Resulting in a Sharp Drop of Thirty-Seven Yuan

Yesterday, the unofficial market conditions for cash "cooked red" in this city experienced another major storm. The downtrend suddenly turned more intense, with the decline as swift as a broken bamboo. It successively retreated into the four major levels of 2130 yuan to 2100 yuan. It once fell to a low of 2090 yuan, a staggering 110 yuan lower than the unprecedented peak of 2200 yuan last Saturday. While various groups of merchants were absorbing slowly, British and American economic aid to China became more active. The Sino-British loan has been established, financial security has been further consolidated, and foreign exchange has been dramatically softened by North China merchants (including the Joint Reserve Bank) and Chinese and Western speculators cutting their positions. Cash bulls were naturally lacking interest. Therefore, after a certain gold firm began selling, and the money exchange industry, acting on behalf of wealthy merchants, aggressively advanced, although securities firms, jewelry stores, and money exchange businesses bought in along the way, they were all profiting and buying on the rebound, and did not want to pay high prices, causing gold prices to further plummet. In the end, it fell sharply by another 37 yuan, people were extremely tired, and trading was busy, with volume exceeding 1,000 taels in the morning and afternoon. The market situation was slightly chaotic again, and jewelry gold dropped by three yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.

"Cooked Red" Falls Miserably

Since the initial opening in the morning, upon hearing that the foreign exchange softening trend was quite severe, people became more tired, and sellers flocked, while buyers were scarce. As a result, the price broke into the twenty yuan level. Initially, a certain gold firm sold 100 taels to a money exchange business, and a jewelry store gang sold 50 taels, with the opening price at 2115 yuan, 20 yuan lower than the previous closing. After the opening, the foreign exchange suddenly stopped softening and turned tight, and people's sentiments were suddenly stimulated, and buying interest gradually intensified, and the price rebounded immediately. A jewelry store gang bought 50 taels from a cash firm for 16 yuan, a money exchange business bought 50 taels from a jewelry store gang for 18 yuan, and another money exchange business bought 50 taels from a gold firm for 20 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange business bought another 50 taels from a jewelry store gang for 24 yuan, and a certain money exchange business bought 50 taels from a securities gang at the same price. After that, the price suddenly reversed downwards, because the foreign exchange trend became soft again, and sellers flourished again. A securities gang sold 50 taels to a money exchange business for 21 yuan, the money exchange businesses traded 50 taels among themselves for 19 yuan, and the money exchange business sold 100 taels to a securities gang for 14 yuan and 12 yuan. After that, a certain gold firm came to aggressively sell again, breaking into the ten yuan level. The gold firm sold 50 taels to a securities gang for 08 yuan, and then sold 50 taels to a jewelry store gang for 10 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was still flat. Initially, a jewelry store gang bought 50 taels from a money exchange business for 10 yuan, and a money exchange business bought 50 taels from a gold firm for 11 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange continued to report softening and cheapening, causing buyers to become hesitant again, and the price fell sharply. The money exchange business sold 50 taels to a jewelry store gang for 05 yuan. Afterwards, more sellers emerged, not hesitating to sell at low prices, breaking into the hundred yuan level. A certain money exchange business sold 50 taels to a gold firm for 2090 yuan, which was the lowest price of the day. Afterwards, the gold firm continued to buy, so it rebounded. The gold firm bought 50 taels from a money exchange business for 96 yuan, and finally bought 50 taels from a money exchange business for 2098 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 37 yuan compared to the previous day (having fallen for four consecutive days, totaling 92 yuan). It was heard that after the closing, a certain money exchange business suddenly wanted to buy, and raised the price to outside the hundred yuan level, bidding 02 yuan to buy, but still could not find a counterparty, and it did not open. The cash firm's own-brand gold was sold for 2105 yuan and bought back for 2090 yuan. The current standard premium gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and gold firms did not open.

Jewelry Gold Down Three Yuan

Jewelry gold at jewelry stores, initially the selling price per tael was unchanged. However, around 9:54 AM, because "cooked red" opened 20 yuan lower, it was also lowered by one yuan accordingly. Later, around 2:55 PM, because the underlying trend of "cooked red" was even more tired, it was lowered by another one yuan. Later, around 3:27 PM, because "cooked red" broke into the hundred yuan level, it was lowered by another one yuan. Da Tong Hang and Lao Qing Yun, etc., changed to listing 113 yuan, and new shops also changed to listing 211 yuan, buying back for 205 yuan.

British Pure Gold Unchanged

A London cable from the 7th reports that the price of British pure gold per ounce is trending sideways, remaining at 7 pounds 8 shillings 2 and a half pence. As a result, the Central Bank's Chinese cash purchase price also remains at 1209.9 yuan, and the listed customs gold also remains unchanged, calculated at 2.392 yuan. The Shanghai standard premium gold price also remains unchanged, calculated at 1205.2 yuan.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Unchanged

A London cable from the 7th reports that after India bought in, it suddenly re-released a small amount, and the market was flat. After the closing, it remained stable, but later turned sideways. The telegraphic transfer silver for both near and far dates was unchanged. A New York silver cable reports that the spot price of US silver remains sideways. Also, a Bombay silver cable reports that the Indian silver market is calm, and both spot and futures prices are unchanged.

### Discount Rate Remains Stable

Yesterday, the discount rate for drawn bills (per thousand yuan) remained stable. It was 47.75 yuan in the morning and then returned to 48 yuan in the afternoon, the same as the previous day's price.

### Foreign Exchange Has International Protection, Foreign Currencies Experience Sharp Reactive Decline

Yesterday, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies declined by 125. Since the establishment of the loan, sentiment in the foreign exchange market has been extremely weak. Foreign firms have been less willing to settle accounts, Sassoon and others have been aggressively selling, banks' absorption capacity has been sluggish, and the supply of foreign telegrams has been continuous. Market prices have been softening step by step, and the trend has been very hard. "Cooked Red" has been softening along with foreign exchange drafts, and gold firms and jewelry businesses have been emerging one after another. The Tianjin gang, due to the higher gold prices in Tianjin, which offer profitable opportunities, took advantage of the low prices to absorb and drag in, so it rebounded once, but because the foreign exchange draft softening trend continued unabated, it was difficult to maintain. The legal tender has international guarantees, the speculative period for gold has decreased, and investing in public bonds is a shortcut to profit, so people are selling them off to obtain legal tender, and gold prices are trending downwards again. The situation is very weak. Foreign currencies are affected by the softening of foreign exchange drafts and the decline in gold prices, making it difficult to gain a foothold. Wealthy individuals are selling them frequently, and buyers are becoming increasingly scarce. Under the downtrend, no one dares to collect them. Except for the application of payment for goods, there is no large-scale need for various currencies, causing market prices to decline across the board, resulting in a sharp reactive decline, which is unprecedented since the War of Resistance. Association transactions have decreased. Qin Tai sold and Yong Tai bought $500 in US dollar drafts; Ying Feng sold and Yong Tai bought 50 British gold pounds; Yong Tai sold and Hong Chang bought 50 British gold pounds; Qin Tai sold and Cheng Tai bought $500 in US dollar drafts. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds down 6 jiao, British gold banknotes down 5 jiao and 5 fen, American gold pounds down 5 jiao, American gold banknotes down 1 jiao and 2 fen, Hong Kong banknotes down 3 fen and 4 li, French franc banknotes down 2.5 li, Singapore banknotes down 3 fen, Dutch banknotes down 5 fen, Annam banknotes down 5 fen, Robi banknotes down 3 fen, Canadian banknotes down 1 jiao, and Philippine banknotes down 5 fen. Only Italian banknotes, German gold banknotes, and Siamese banknotes had no transactions and remained unchanged.

### Securities Stimulated by the British Loan, Domestic and Foreign Debt Rise Sharply by About One Yuan; Foreign Debt Jumps by Two or Three Pounds

Yesterday's market conditions for securities in the unofficial market were due to the report of joint action by the United States and other countries to provide economic aid to China, which had been reported in newspapers, and people's sentiments were extremely excited. Large investors bought in with increasing volume. The 50-yuan mark for Class C bonds has been approached twice, and although it has not been broken through, it is only a matter of time before it will be broken through. This is because after the success of this large loan, foreign currency public bonds have risen sharply by several pounds. It is heard that it has been decided to pay interest, and it has also been heard in the financial community that the seventh interest on unified debts will definitely be able to restore the original method of paying in legal tender in one lump sum. Since the War of Resistance, this is the greatest international sympathy that has been obtained, and the future of the War of Resistance will be very favorable. The issue of resuming trading at the exchange is only a matter of whether the stipulated price can be cancelled or revised; otherwise, there are no other issues. The bullish outlook for market prices is beyond doubt. The high prices of January 10th and the highest prices of May 4, 1938, are specifically presented again and listed below for reference.

Yesterday's transactions: the opening was due to Da Feng's efforts to buy, which was rumored to be on behalf of the Ge Bank, absorbing a total of about 600,000. Market prices gradually rose, and Class C bonds broke through nine yuan again, and then approached the 5-yuan mark. As a result of the selling of long positions in No. 35, it once rebounded slightly by 4 or 5 jiao, but because Tian Sheng, Run Li, Mao Da, and others still had strong appetites, and Da Feng continued to add to their positions, although Qia Feng Hang sold a lot, the price could not be stopped, and it rebounded by 3 or 4 jiao again. People's sentiment was extremely good, and the noon closing was already about 8 jiao to 1 yuan higher than before. The afternoon opening saw Da Feng Hang's absorption appetite still strong, and there was also a great need for No. 20. Other firms such as No. 15 and Mao Da Hang also had considerable buying. On the selling side, Xin Feng, Yong, and long positions emerged, and No. 5, Tong Kang, Lian He, and other firms sold slightly. Supply was already seen to be exceeding demand, and market prices were still extremely firm. Class C bonds were seen again at 49.9 yuan, approaching the 50-yuan mark. The closing situation was excellent, which was unprecedented since the War of Resistance. As a result, market prices rose unanimously again by 9.5 jiao to 1.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 1.5 million yuan. A brief and clear table is listed below.

The two highest prices after the war are attached below:

(1) The victory in the Battle of Taierzhuang

(2) There is talk in Europe and America of economic sanctions against Japan

### Yarn Speculation Shifts to Fine Yarn, Thread Prices Jump Seven Yuan Suddenly, 20-Count Yarn Falls Instead by Two or Three Yuan

The yarn market started rising, then leveled off, and the trend remains gradual. The reason is that actual demand is increasingly slack, and various groups still lack vitality. Most opinions among industry insiders are bullish, so when prices are low, they come to absorb and drag in a few packages, and the market situation turns upward again. After prices are high, some people come to sell again, and the chips loosen slightly, and the market tends to decline. The fundamental problem is that actual transactions are too lacking, so although buyers' intentions are strong, they are still difficult to consolidate. The overall trend currently has not broken free from a state of circling and lingering. However, fine yarn thread prices are particularly strong due to many parties using seasonal relationships to pull and manipulate. Daily transactions are mostly among industry insiders, so the rising trend is particularly intense, having risen sharply by 30 to 40 yuan in three or four days. Once actual demand is slightly sluggish, the reaction will also be severe, and one must be wary of it.

Current yarn situation: at the initial opening in the morning, market sentiment remained sideways, but there were still inquiries for 32-count and 42-count fine yarn threads from customer parties, and market prices jumped 5 yuan. The 42-count Cat and Butterfly opened at 553 yuan, cash price, up 5 to 7 yuan from the previous day. Soon after, 32-count Heavenly Maiden also rose 7 yuan, to 537 yuan. The 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at 403 yuan, with little difference from the previous day; the godown receipt price was 400 yuan and 5 jiao. Later, it was heard that actual sales were not strong, and it fell back again. The 20-count Double Horse spot price was 402 yuan, and the godown receipt price traded at 398 yuan. In the afternoon, the momentum was slightly flat and tired, and actual demand was also scarce. The 20-count Double Horse fell back 2 yuan, trading at 400 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 397.5 yuan. As a result, it was found that various groups bought a total of 1,440 packages throughout the day. Market prices: 20-count Double Horse fell 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day, Heavenly Maiden fell 3 yuan, but 32-count and 42-count still rose 5 to 7 yuan. The factory opened 430 packages of 20-count Double Earth yarn from the Xin Yu Factory, priced at 399.5 yuan to 400 yuan, and also 200 packages of 10-count Double Earth, priced at 297.5 yuan to 298 yuan. Today, 700 pieces of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 120 pieces were shipped to Fuzhou, and 275 pieces were shipped to Ningbo. The amount of spot yarn purchased by each group is listed on the left.

Industry Insiders 1,110, Wenzhou 5

Shantou 75, Yunnan 45

Hong Kong 145, Tianjin 25

Zhejiang 5, Inland 10

Total 1,440 packages

Japanese Yarn Market: demand from all parties is flat, but large players do not release their long positions. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon is 334 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix is approximately 328.9 yuan, down 1 yuan from the previous day.

### Raw Cotton Expensive, Factory Purchases Weaken

The raw cotton business is increasingly sluggish, because prices are too high, and factories have no intention of procuring. At the same time, although fine yarn thread prices are advancing step by step, 20-count yarn prices are weakening. In this situation, factories also have no intention of procuring much of the expensive raw material. However, because inventory is low, although there is an unfavorable environment shrouding the market, prices are still difficult to loosen. However, according to some news, foreign cotton block corners have fallen, and the converted price per dan is more than one yuan lower than the previous day, and various factories have a stronger desire to purchase foreign cotton for replenishment. As for when the goods will arrive, there is hope that they will arrive at the end of the month. 8,600 packages of Yao flower cotton have arrived. The amount of spot cotton traded and market conditions are listed on the left.

Indian cotton is being continuously transported. It is heard that the British company Alipore is shipping more than 6,640 tons of cotton from Mumbai, totaling more than 28,000 pieces, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai next Monday (the 13th). They are all procured by Japanese merchants. Another 1,000 tons were originally scheduled to be shipped to Japan.

### Piece Goods Heavyweight Coarse Cloth Market Continues to be Firm, Local Inventory is Empty, and the Source from the Da Sheng Factory is Cut Off

The market for domestic cloth and various goods has ups and downs. White goods and coarse cloth from Chinese factories, weighing 14 pounds and 16 pounds, have recently had very smooth spot sales. Furthermore, the Nantong Da Sheng Factory has been forced to stop production, cutting off the source, and the Shanghai inventory is empty, so the market continues to be firm. Each piece has risen by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The trend of lightweight coarse cloth remains flat. There is strong demand from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi gangs for Yong An Factory's Da Peng fine cloth, and there is a shortage of spot goods. Yesterday's opening price was 13 yuan, a sudden increase of 1 jiao and 5 fen compared to before. Cannon Car and Wealthy and Noble brands, etc., rose by 5 fen. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi gangs had a larger appetite, trading several hundred pieces of fine cloth, fine materials, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, and other goods. The Guangdong gangs traded 150 to 160 packages of 16-pound Earth coarse cloth, various factory coarse twill, and fine twill. The demand for goods for the season from various places in the Min province, Fuzhou, Yangkou, and Shaxian, is also gradually developing. The Dian gangs are shipping goods increasingly frequently, and the warehouses still feel insufficient. The Chengdu gangs' purchases are also small and scattered.

East Cloth's fine cloth and fine twill rose in the morning and fell back in the afternoon, and selling prices were unchanged. However, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth had more floating amounts among retail investors, and the price was extremely chaotic, and the trend continued to soften. In the morning, it once fell sharply to 11.875 yuan. The Tianjin gangs took advantage of the low prices to search for more than 200 pieces, and then it immediately rebounded to 9.5 jiao. Dyeing factories on this street, because the trend of colored twill was good, procured 500 pieces of various brands of fine twill yesterday, so the price of fine twill was firmer. Fine cloth, with medium- and low-grade Lei and high-grade Yanghe being firm, Yanghe's market price still requires 12.15 yuan. Continuing to have 500 to 600 pieces of various brands of fine cloth sold to this street, few are opening shops. Only Dong Mian Foreign Firm wrote out 100 and several dozen packages of 12-pound Blue Chicken fine cloth for the April term, with the price per piece being 11.85 yuan.

Today, 255 pieces of piece goods were exported to Ningbo, 43 pieces were shipped to Fuzhou, and 135 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

### Foreign Exchange Drafts Rise, Cotton Prices Fall, Large Foreign Cotton Trades Occur

Foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market opened weak in the morning. There were widespread rumors in the market that Washington would release loan cotton early, so there were no buyers in the market. Southern parties were selling short and long positions were closing out strongly, so market prices fell sharply by 11 to 15 points. The Indian market had been in unofficial trading for the past few days, so market prices were uneven. Since the exchange officially opened for trading yesterday, the market situation has been brought into order. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell sharply by 2 Robi, and Egyptian cotton fell by 35 points. Because the loan was successful yesterday, foreign exchange softened sharply, with recent months at 8 and a half pence per shilling, US dollars at 16.25 yuan, and Robi at 46.5 yuan. Converted into legal tender, cotton prices all fell by 2 or 3 yuan. It is estimated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton each fell by 2.1 yuan per dan, Indian cotton fell by 2.3 to 2.6 yuan per dan, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 3 yuan.

Shanghai foreign cotton transactions: because foreign cotton prices fell sharply, which was much more cost-effective than domestic cotton, yesterday's transactions were unusually lively, especially Indian cotton. In recent days, Shen Xin Factory has purchased more than 10,000 packages of Indian cotton. When the purchase was made, it coincided with the Indian cotton exchange suspending trading, and market prices could not be brought into order. At that time, cotton prices were at their peak in nearly six months. It is heard that a huge transaction was signed, totaling about 50,000 dan. The day before yesterday, cotton prices fell sharply, by about 3 or 4 yuan per dan. The amount of foreign cotton traded yesterday and the factory price of foreign cotton after conversion are listed below.

### Grains: Most Japonica Rice Reaching the Price Ceiling; Large Shipment of White Rice Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, First Since the Lunar New Year; Volume Exceeds 14,000 Bags; Negotiations Underway for Foreign Rice

Sources of Du Rice from various guilds are gradually increasing; the price of rice from the He Xia area arriving on the 7th, including cart-pulled rice and bagged rice, is 7-8,000 bags, but public sentiment remains high. Local businesses and hoarders are still actively buying, so the market is tight again, and a continued muddled situation is seen. As a result, high-quality thick-grain Japonica rice has reached 14 yuan again, while mid-grade rice has increased by 2-3 jiao. The situation with Du Yang and superior grade rice is similar, all at 14 yuan. Rice from the Bund area is priced at 13.56 to 13.8 yuan, also an increase of 3 jiao. The price of Bai Yuan rice has not changed, but the quality appears mixed, and it is difficult to distinguish between mid and lower grades.

The purchase of Xian rice by both local customers and hoarders is brisk, with another 7-8,000 bags transacted throughout the market, and prices have increased by 2-3 jiao. Wu Xian rice has reached 13.2 yuan, and Gao Jing Xian is quoted at 13.5 yuan. Several hundred bags of foreign rice were offered yesterday, with Saigon rice reaching 16.5 yuan. Although foreign firms' orders have not been finalized, both sides are in negotiation. Recent external fees are 17.3 yuan, while inclusive fees are close to 18 yuan. This price is difficult to reach, but since current stockpiles are not abundant, there are plans to hold out for better prices.

Since the Lunar New Year, the supply of rice has been cut off. According to rice merchants, there is still a lot of rice stored inland, but due to the heavy taxes imposed by the Japanese puppet regime, it is unbearable, causing rice merchants to hesitate. Although there are still stocks in this city, there are fears of shortages, so rice prices have gradually risen recently. The Rice Industry Association has issued a notice regarding price limits, but all rice types have reached the limit. A reporter learned that yesterday morning, the Taikoo Yangxing Wuhu ship imported 14,049 bags of white rice from Hupou. This is the first import since the New Year, and it is hoped that rice prices can stabilize on their own.

### Cheap Dumping of Foreign Flour

The flour market is nominally firm but actually loose. Retail sales from various guilds are still fairly active, but due to the continuous arrival of foreign flour in small batches and the dumping of flour at low prices, the prospects for local flour are quite affected. Therefore, flour prices have gradually become chaotic in an intangible way. According to manufacturer sources yesterday, factory prices have been divided into three types for several days. On the surface, prices have not loosened, but in reality, covert prices for local merchants are still 4.7 yuan, 4.7 yuan for the Nanyang guild, and only 4.65 yuan as a special price for the Beiyang guild. A total of over 10,000 bags were traded by both the Southern and Northern guilds throughout the market. Due to the inconsistent factory prices among local merchants, trading volume is not high. "Further News": The market price of foreign flour is gradually declining and is already equal to the selling price of local flour. Futures for March and April are even cheaper, selling for only 2.5 US dollars, totaling only 4 yuan per bag. Yesterday, 2-3,000 bags were traded in the local market. Given this environment, the flour market has been almost completely seized by foreign goods. Today, 12,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Fuzhou, and 1,000 bags to Tianjin. In addition, 200 bags of bran are being shipped to Fuzhou and 1,000 bags to Ningbo.

### Japanese Warships at the Jiaojiang Estuary Bombard Haimen Again; Chinese Troops Stand Guard; Japanese Warships Do Not Dare to Penetrate Deeply, Only Destroying Several Civilian Houses and Killing or Injuring Two Civilians

Since the Japanese side notified the consulates of various countries stationed in Shanghai, claiming that they would take military action in Haimen, Zhejiang, and from the 18th of last month, four Japanese warships have twice harassed the Jiaojiang estuary in Haimen, shelling the shore. After the local garrison bravely fought back and inflicted heavy damage, the Japanese warships quietly sailed away from the blockade line. Since then, although they still patrol outside the estuary from time to time, they have not taken any further action. Therefore, order in Haimen has returned to normal. Foreign merchants' transport ships are also planning to resume sailing, but the Japanese side is using the excuse that the military action is not yet complete, so they are still preventing foreign ships from sailing to Taiwan. According to a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency, who inquired with the shipping industry, at 10:35 AM the day before yesterday (the 8th), two more Japanese warships approached the blockade line at the Jiaojiang estuary. Immediately, they shelled the shore indiscriminately. The Chinese garrison, considering that the Japanese warships' shells were aimless and mostly fell on wasteland, stood guard and ignored them. Knowing that the Chinese side was prepared, the Japanese warships did not dare to penetrate deeply. After firing more than 30 shells, they sailed away from Jiaojiang. An investigation afterward revealed that only a few civilian houses were destroyed, and two civilians were killed or injured. There were no other losses, so the local situation remains peaceful, and the people are extremely calm. As for the resumption of the Shanghai-Taiwan line, it will be impossible to achieve for the time being.

Registration for Dredging Waterways and Shipping

The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander has granted the request of shipping merchants to allow foreign transport ships to resume sailing to Haimen. Starting from March 1st, ship registration will be reprocessed, and the garrison will dredge the Jiaojiang waterway, leaving one channel open on the Jiaojiang blockade line. Ships passing through must send personnel to guide the ships. The other blockade line built by Japanese warships in Jiaojiang will be destroyed. All ships sailing to Haimen have complied with the order to re-register and are preparing to send ships to sail on the Shanghai-Taiwan line, etc. The Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander has forwarded the request to the Second Army Group for approval.

Counties Ordered to Investigate and Arrest Bandits

All coastal areas of East Zhejiang are heavily garrisoned by the Ningbo and Taizhou Defense Commanders, who have constructed defensive works and are under strict guard to prevent any incidents. In view of the fact that pirates in East Zhejiang have colluded with certain parties, claiming to be a certain allied army, and have repeatedly attempted to launch riots in East Zhejiang to disrupt the rear's security, the leaders of the bandits have already been arrested and executed according to the law. Now, in order to eliminate bandits, orders have been issued to the county governments to offer rewards for the investigation and arrest of bandits. Regardless of who it is, anyone who captures and sends in a traitor who is interrogated and found guilty will be rewarded with 100 yuan. Anyone who provides information leading to the arrest will be rewarded with 50 yuan. Anyone who reports and exposes an organization of traitors will be rewarded with 100 yuan. Anyone who knowingly hides traitors and fails to report them will be severely punished according to the law if they are exposed by others.

### Government Borrows Ten Million Pounds Sterling to Fill Exchange Equalization Fund; The Value of the Legal Tender and Foreign Exchange Will Become More Stable and Consolidated; Black Market Exchange Rates in Shanghai Have Unanimously Eased

Since our government successfully controlled foreign exchange, the legal tender has ample reserves, and the statutory exchange rate has been maintained consistently. The foreign exchange on the black market has also been stabilized. Now, a loan of ten million pounds sterling has been established with four banks, including HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, to create an exchange equalization fund. Details are recorded as follows:

After Successful Foreign Exchange Control

The Ministry of Finance implemented foreign exchange control from March 14th last year, stipulating that if banks require foreign exchange for legitimate purposes, they must apply to the Central Bank after offsetting receipts and payments. The aim is to break the "United Reserve Bank" banknote exchange for legal tender to profit from foreign exchange and to manage the foreign exchange required for imports to achieve international trade balance. The restrictions on the sale of foreign exchange are used to control the escape of domestic funds. In addition, measures for merchants to export goods and settle foreign exchange have been promulgated to promote the export of local goods to replenish the foreign exchange fund. The statutory exchange rate for British pounds is one shilling and two and a half pence, and for US dollars, thirty US dollars. Since then, foreign exchange has stabilized, merchants have reduced many unnecessary losses, and import and export trade has gradually shown a prosperous phenomenon.

Maintaining the Stability of the Statutory Exchange Rate and the Black Market

Since the war of resistance, agriculture, industry, and commerce have suffered extremely severe devastation. The difficulties in the lives of people in the war zones have reached their extreme. In the rear provinces, due to obstructed transportation and financial turnover and the supply and demand of materials, they have become increasingly difficult. The government is deeply aware of this and is determined to maintain the credit of the legal tender with all its strength. To maintain the credit of the legal tender, the first step is to stabilize foreign exchange. Therefore, since the war of resistance, the statutory exchange rate has remained the same. As for foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market, it has also been stabilized in cooperation with the British HSBC Bank. The policy of controlling foreign currency and maintaining the credit of the legal tender has gained the faith and praise of Chinese and foreign figures. Although the issuance of legal tender has increased after the war, cash reserves have increased instead, fully complying with the regulations for the issuance of legal tender. Monthly inspections are publicly announced to demonstrate great trust.

Borrow Ten Million Pounds to Serve as a Fund

Now, in order to maintain the credit of the legal tender, stabilize foreign exchange, and ensure commercial transactions, so that exchange rates have a reasonable and solid foundation, it has been decided to allocate ten million pounds sterling as a fund to stabilize the legal tender. Arrangements have been properly made with the British government and two British banks, HSBC and Mercantile Bank, as well as two of our own banks, Bank of China and Bank of Communications. The British banks, HSBC and Mercantile Bank, and the Chinese banks, Bank of China and Bank of Communications, will each undertake loans of five million pounds sterling. If there are any losses at the end of this fund, the Ministry of Finance will be responsible for compensation. The British government will guarantee the loans from HSBC and Mercantile. The term is tentatively set at one year. After the term expires, it can be extended for a certain period if agreed, but it can be repaid and terminated early if necessary.

Foreign Exchange on the Shanghai Black Market Eases

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from foreign banking circles in Shanghai yesterday that since the Chinese government established an exchange equalization fund of ten million pounds sterling with four banks, including HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, to stabilize the legal tender and maintain foreign exchange, Chinese and foreign banking circles believe that the legal tender and foreign exchange of China will become more consolidated and stable. As a result, foreign exchange rates on the Shanghai black market have unanimously eased. Yesterday, the British HSBC Bank quoted the British pound at eight pence and the US dollar at 15.625 yuan, but the actual transaction exchange rate was 8.25 pence for the British pound and 16.125 yuan for the US dollar. Because the government's loan from HSBC, Mercantile, etc., was successful, there is a tendency for the exchange rate to ease further.

### Japanese Forcibly Occupy British Yarn Factory; Continued Negotiations; British Members of Parliament Raise Questions; Foreign Affairs Department Clarifies Attitude

London, 8th (Reuters) - Labour MP White asked in the House of Commons today about the Shanghai Municipal Council's special group administered by the Japanese, asking Foreign Secretary Butler to explain the purpose and scope of powers of this group. Butler replied that he had not received detailed information about the powers of this special group, but he could tell the House with certainty that the administrative understanding established with the Japanese authorities did not harm the nature of the Council's powers. Conservative Party member Pollett asked about the reasons why the Japanese did not relinquish the British-owned yarn factories in Shanghai. Butler replied that although the Japanese authorities had been informed of everything by the British Consul-General in Shanghai, they still expressed doubts about the British ownership of three factories, while the fourth factory was located in Zhoujiazui and is currently occupied by the Japanese army and used as an office by the Japanese army transport team. The British side has recently negotiated with Tokyo again, and will continue to do its best to negotiate to ensure that the Japanese side returns the British factories as soon as possible.

### Japan Implements Export Control in North China; Reportedly to Revise "Tax Rates" and Implement a "License System"

The Continental News reports that the Japanese "advisor" to the puppet "United Reserve Bank" in Beiping informed the Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce yesterday (the 8th) that on the 11th of this month, new export controls will be strictly enforced on twelve important export commodities in North China. This is the initial step in fully controlling export goods from North China to overseas. After the new control system is implemented for one or two months, it is hoped that all other goods will be subject to control. In about three months, the puppet bank in Beiping will implement a license system for the entire foreign trade of North China. In particular, the current tax rates in the Japanese-occupied areas will be revised to enhance economic cooperation between Japan and North China.

### Unified Bonds to Be Drawn Today; Government Still Finding Ways to Advance Payment

Due to the fact that customs duties in the war zones had been seized, the Ministry of Finance issued a notice regarding future methods of compensating for customs duty claims. However, in order to maintain debt credibility, principal and interest payments on internal debts such as the Unified Bonds and the Reconstruction Bonds will be made as usual. The National Debt Fund Management Committee has been ordered to unify Type B bonds, long-term financial public bonds, and the reorganization of Guangdong financial public bonds. It has been determined that today at 10:00 AM, a lottery will be held to repay the principal. Type B Unified Bonds and long-term financial bonds are both secured by surplus customs duties. Now it has been decided that the government will advance payments as usual to ensure that principal and interest are paid on schedule, thus deeply winning the trust of bondholders, and the domestic bond market has rebounded unanimously. The seventh payment period for Type B Unified Bonds is July 31st, and the eleventh payment period for long-term financial bonds is March 31st.

### The Municipal Council's Tax Increase Yesterday Caused Criticism; Japanese Residents Expressed Strong Dissatisfaction

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that the Municipal Council announced last night (the 8th) that it was unable to meet this year's expenditure and resolved to increase tax rates by 2% from October, which has already caused criticism from Chinese and Japanese people. This morning (the 9th), most Chinese taxpayers stated that the so-called wartime prosperity of Shanghai would be short-lived, and the Municipal Council's 2% tax increase would place an excessive burden on taxpayers. Today, the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" criticized the Municipal Council's tax increase, saying that Japanese taxpayers, in addition to other taxpayers, would also suffer losses. Japanese residents will debate and criticize this, and that the land prices on the south and north banks of the Suzhou River are different, and the land rent in Hongkou should be reduced according to the true value of the land.

### Dasheng Yarn Factory Forced to Suspend Production; German Consulate lodges strong protest; Japanese Spinners' Association Discussing Raising Funds for Purchase; German Merchants Resolutely Refuse to Give Up Operating Rights

The first, third, and second yarn factories of Dasheng in Nantong and Haimen, managed by the German-owned Ewo Yiyang Trading Company, were recently blockaded by the Japanese side and ordered to suspend production. The trading company has reported the situation to the German Consul-General stationed in Shanghai and lodged a protest. It is now learned that the Japanese Spinning Industry Association in China has convened various Japanese yarn factories to discuss raising funds to purchase and operate the factories. The following are the details obtained by a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency:

History of the Factory

Dasheng Textile Company originally had three factories: the first, second, and third factories. They were founded by Chinese merchants Zhang Jian and others. The first factory was opened in April of the Guangxu 20th year of the Qing Dynasty. The factory was located in Tangjiazha, Nantong, with a capital of 6.3 million yuan, 92,520 yarn spindles, 2,000 thread spindles, 505 looms, and more than 7,000 male and female workers. The sub-factory attached to the first factory was opened in October of the 13th year of the Republic of China. The factory was located in Jiangjiaqiao outside the South Gate of Nantong, with a capital of 1.5 million yuan, 19,508 yarn spindles, 240 looms, and more than 1,500 male and female workers. The second factory was opened in March of the Guangxu 33rd year of the Qing Dynasty. The factory was located south of Jiulong Town, Qidong (it was closed before the war). The third factory was opened in September of the 10th year of the Republic of China. The factory was located in Nanwan, Changle Town, Haimen, with a capital of 4.2 million yuan, 30,300 yarn spindles, 444 looms, and more than 2,000 male and female workers. These two factories have a long history and magnificent equipment, and they have a considerable position in the Chinese spinning industry. The yarn threads of various trademarks such as Peacock, Kui Xing, Dragon and Phoenix, Double Dragon, and Lion are sold throughout the country. Before the war, Xu Jingren was the chairman of the board and was responsible for presiding over the business. The capital of the two factories was entirely funded and established by domestic commercial giants, with no foreign investment. Their public accumulation funds also increased year by year, with the first factory accumulating 270,000 yuan and the second factory accumulating 85,200 yuan.

Outstanding Foreign Debt

When the two factories were first established, business was at its peak in the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China. Later, Japanese yarn factories sprang up in Shanghai and expanded extremely, competing to overwhelm Chinese factory owners. The two factories also buried themselves in construction, improved products, and ordered machinery from abroad, earnestly operating. Although the surface still tended to be stable, it was actually hit hard. The flow of funds gradually decreased. Until the "August 13th" Shanghai war broke out, the two factories were in a state of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. The amount owed to the German-owned Ewo Yiyang Trading Company for the purchase of machinery was very large. As a result, the factory authorities, firstly because of the oppressive environment, and secondly because they could not clear the foreign debt, did not hesitate to allow this career, which had been painstakingly planned for decades, to fall into the hands of foreigners. In the early days of the Sino-Japanese War, in order to protect its own rights and interests, the German merchant sent a German-based employee to request that a small team of German troops stationed in Shanghai be stationed in the factory for protection. Later, when counties along the Yangtze River fell and the war shifted west, Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai successively resumed work. As a result, the trading company went ahead and completed the reorganization for resumption of work for more than a year.

Japanese Coveting

Since the first and third factories of Dasheng were managed and opened by the German merchant Ewo Yiyang Trading Company, the Japanese were very dissatisfied. They originally wanted to seize the operating rights of the factory, but they had no way to realize it. However, they were still plotting and using various methods, hoping to destroy it. At first, under the guise of military affairs, they stationed more than 500 naval landing troops in the first factory in the southern district and the third factory in Haimen, and turned the second and third floors of the factory into garrison barracks, and set up a watch哨台 on the top floor with machine guns. The female workers working in the factory were arbitrarily teased and raped, while the male workers were requisitioned to transport ammunition and dig fortifications. If male workers returned home after work and were pointed out as guerrillas when they entered the factory the next day, they would be arrested and shot, or released after being proved by the factory. All of these things made the factory's operations unable to be free. In October of last year, the Japanese side proposed cooperation terms, which were rejected by the German merchant, resulting in a delay until recently, for nearly half a year. The Japanese side brought up the old matter again, but did not get results, so the Japanese side suddenly took decisive measures on the 2nd of this month to blockade the factory and ordered the suspension of work by Hama Moto Sazaburo, the head of the military intelligence agency stationed in Nantong, who issued an announcement. All male and female workers who remained working in the factory were expelled, and many Japanese troops were stationed around the factory buildings.

German Consulate Protest

After the Japanese side suddenly forced the two factories to suspend production by force, the German merchant Ewo Yiyang Trading Company believed that the Japanese side illegally blockaded the factory, hindering business. Based on the report of the resident personnel, they petitioned the German Consul stationed in Germany and lodged a strong protest, hoping to resume work as soon as possible and demanding compensation for losses. The matter is now being negotiated by the German consulate with the Japanese side. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency, the Japanese Spinning Industry Association in China convened a meeting of the heads of various spinning factories in Shanghai at the beginning of this week to discuss the acquisition of Dasheng Yarn Factory. When the reporter inquired with relevant parties, it was said that the German merchant's attitude was quite firm and he would never let go of Qin Hui Yiqi because of illegal obstruction. Therefore, the future of this dispute is still difficult to predict.

### Portuguese Merchant Ship Hailong Searched by Japanese; Passengers Greatly Alarmed Outside Jiaojiang Estuary in Zhejiang

The Hailong, a vessel owned by the Portuguese merchant Atlantic Navigation Company, which sails the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, loaded goods and passengers from Wenzhou on March 6th and sailed to Shanghai. At about 6 PM on the evening of the 7th, when it reached outside the Jiaojiang Estuary, it was stopped by a Japanese warship patrolling the Zhejiang waters using flag signals. Japanese soldiers boarded the ship in a small motorboat to carry out an inspection. Because ships on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line usually sail outside, and this ship suddenly sailed inside, it aroused the suspicion of the Japanese warship. As a result, nothing was found, and it was only released on the morning of the 8th and sailed to Shanghai as usual. After arriving in Shanghai the night before, the ship reported to the company and loaded goods and passengers as usual yesterday to sail to Wenzhou. The ship's passengers had been greatly alarmed. It is said that the reason why the ship sailed inside from Wenzhou to Shanghai this time was because the inner voyage was closer than the outer voyage.

### Japan Exclusively Dominates the Shipping Industry in China; Greatly Affecting the United Kingdom; Monopolizing Shipping in North China; Controlling Inland River Ferries; Refusing to Open the Yangtze River and Obstructing Shipping from Various Countries

Since Japanese warships blockaded the coastal ports of our country, state-run and private ships have been forced to suspend navigation. Japan wants to exclusively dominate the shipping industry in China, such as controlling inland river ferries in Central China, monopolizing shipping in North China, planning to open a Nanyang line, and refusing to open the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. The shipping industries of Britain and the United States in China have been affected. The following are the details:

The United Kingdom Ranks First in Shipping in China

In the coastal and inland river shipping industry in China, British shipping power ranks first. For example, in 1936, the number and tonnage of ships entering various ports in China from the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States were as follows: United Kingdom: 48,154 ships, 57,345,515 tons; Japan: 17,911 ships, 24,913,576 tons; United States: 3,973 ships, 3,771,479 tons. This proves that the strength of British shipping in China is more than twice that of Japan. However, the situation has changed drastically since the outbreak of the war. In 1937, the number of British ships entering and leaving China decreased by 12,831 ships and 21,239,720 tons.

Japan Attempts to Exclusively Dominate After the War

After the war, shipping merchants from Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Greece, and Pakistan purchased Chinese ships and tried their best to expand the shipping industry in China. However, Japan attempted to exclusively dominate the shipping industry in China, such as refusing to open the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, obstructing foreign ships from sailing to Funing in northern Jiangsu and Haimen in eastern Zhejiang, and unreasonably detaining and inspecting foreign ships. At the same time, in North China, they used special forces to monopolize shipping. In Central China, Japan has replaced the United Kingdom's position. Inland river ferries in Central China are controlled by Japan and operated exclusively. In addition to opening shipping routes from Shanghai to Xiamen, they are also planning to open a Nanyang route between Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The British Shipping Industry is Greatly Affected

Since the autumn of 1938, Japanese shipping in China has suddenly made rapid progress. The shipping industries of Britain and the United States in China have been greatly affected. For example, last year, the number of Japanese ships entering and leaving various ports in China increased to 5,473 ships and 6,484,620 tons, ranking second. In January of this year, Japan had 478 ships and 759,889 tons, while the United Kingdom had 304 ships and 840,302 tons. The number of ships decreased compared to Japan, and the tonnage was almost the same as Japan, which proves that the British shipping industry in China is gradually declining, while the Japanese shipping industry in China is gradually developing, which is obviously affected by Japan's exclusive domination of the shipping industry in China.

Dalian Japan Qing Expands Shipping

Japanese shipping in China and shipping in North China are controlled by the Dalian Steamship Company. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River are exclusively navigated by the Japan Qing Company. The inland rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are monopolized by the Inland River Shipping Company. Today, the Japan Qing Company is expanding its shipping industry in China. In addition to illegally confiscating the ships of Chinese merchants, it has also newly built Jianghai ships of more than 1,000 tons and joined the coastal and middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River routes. The Japanese military authorities provide various conveniences, and the Japanese government issues shipping subsidies. Today, the Shanghai-Chongming line, Shanghai-Tongzhou line, and Shanghai-Yangzhou line are all operated by the Japan Qing Company. Ships from third countries are blocked. At the same time, it is said that Japan wants to build a modern port near Hong Kong, and today's shipping in Hong Kong will also fall into desperation.

### Restoration of Postal Services in Anhui; Temporarily Limited to Regular Letters, Express Letters, and Registered Mail

Postal services throughout Anhui Province were suspended due to the war. Postal personnel from various bureaus were ordered to come to Shanghai and set up a temporary Shanghai office of the Anhui Postal Administration in Shanghai to continue handling postal services. It has been more than half a year. All personnel have left Shanghai and gone to Anhui in early last month to restore postal services in various districts and cancel the Anhui Postal Bird's Shanghai office. Various important documents have also been transported for use. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday that it has been four months since the preparation for the restoration of postal services throughout Anhui Province began last winter. Now the local situation in the province has become slightly calmer, and residents have returned to their original residences. In order to facilitate communication among the people, the Provincial Postal Administration has resumed postal services in peaceful areas such as Anqing (Huaining), Huaiyuan, Yongcheng, Hefei, Yicheng, Shucheng, Guangji, Yangxin, and other districts this month. However, it is temporarily limited to regular letters, express letters, and registered mail. Parcels and remittances are still difficult to resume due to traffic obstructions. There are detailed regulations for transportation methods and mailing times. It is also learned that the acceptance of small parcel mail to Sichuan Province has been suspended from yesterday and a notice has been issued stating, "From now on, the acceptance of all small parcel mail to Sichuan Province will be temporarily suspended. This is a special notice."

Ministry of Economic Affairs Approves Public Translation of Trade Associations: English Translation Should Be "Guild"

The translation of the English names of trade associations: Based on a proposal from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce from the year before last, the term "Association" was initially preferred. However, on December 30th of last year, the domestic flavoring manufacturing industry suggested that "Association" had too broad a meaning and that "Guild," with its implications of a trade association, was more accurate. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, considering that the matter concerned the public translation of all trade associations, wired the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now replied, stating, "We have received the telegram. After investigation, the English translation of trade associations should be 'Guild.' However, for trade associations in the banking industry, whose translated names have become customary, changes may be temporarily postponed. Please be informed accordingly."

工部局籌設　乞丐留養所　强壯者應迫令習業
Shanghai Municipal Council Plans to Establish a Beggar Asylum: Able-Bodied Should Be Forced to Learn a Trade

The Shanghai Municipal Council, due to the large number of beggars within the concession begging along the streets, which is both unsightly and obstructs traffic, has been capturing them in districts and detaining them overnight before sending them to the suburbs. However, they soon regroup in Shanghai, making it difficult to manage. Since the war, their numbers have increased, mainly gathering in District A (the area of the Central Old Zha Chengdu Road Police Station) and District B (the area of the New Zha Gordon Road Jing'an Temple Road Putuo Road Police Station). As for District C (the area of the Hongkou Huishi Police Station), due to the special circumstances and sparse population, beggars are absent. Last month, District A captured over one thousand people, and District B captured over six hundred. Therefore, for the sake of tidying up the city, the Municipal Council has decided to establish an asylum for weak and old beggars. Preparations are currently underway. Once established, old and weak beggars will be housed in the asylum, and able-bodied beggars will be forced to learn a trade to clear the streets.

Fake "Fresh Pork Market" to Be Established: Pork Merchants Still Firmly Refuse to Participate: Willing to Suspend Business to Safeguard National Interests: Actively Opposing and Planning Responses

According to Xiandai She, a Japanese businessman named Sato, in collusion with traitorous merchants, is actively organizing a fake "Fresh Pork Market" in an attempt to monopolize the pork trade in the city. The fake organization began preparations in July of last year and registered with the fake "Department of Weixin Industry" and the fake "Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau." However, due to the strong sense of righteousness of all pork merchants in the city, they have firmly opposed and refused to participate, delaying its establishment. According to sources, under Japanese instigation, the fake "Market" has recently resumed activities, planning to build the market in the Yangshupu area, which will soon be completed. However, fresh pork merchants, for the sake of national interests and their own interests, will adhere to their established principle and vow not to participate. They are currently discussing countermeasures and actively opposing it. It is also learned that after the establishment of the fake organization, pigs transported to Shanghai from various places will inevitably be subjected to its organization of slaughter, collection of exorbitant taxes and fees, and monopolistic encroachment, leaving no means untried. Therefore, people in the pork industry would rather suspend business than participate.

大丈夫應精强力足　　何為而衰弱無能
A Real Man Should Be Energetic and Strong: What Causes Weakness and Impotence?

We who are husbands with wives bear significant responsibilities. Not only does the burden of the entire family rest on our shoulders, but the rise and fall of the nation is also our concern. A husband should be energetic and strong, striving to be proactive, only then can he handle his responsibilities joyfully. Indeed, for a strong man with abundant energy, marital life will be fulfilling, love will be deep, and children will be the crystallization of their love. The family they build together will be their happy nest. Therefore, his sole comfort will be his wife and children. What burden of family is there to speak of? In serving society, he can also be diligent and conscientious, increasing work efficiency and reaping rich rewards. Although such a husband cannot be said to have achieved the level of self-cultivation, family harmony, national ambition, and world peace, he can be said to have fulfilled his responsibilities and is worthy of being called a happy and fortunate man.

婚後的荒淫，縱慾與憂勞　傷之故，致精枯血竭，爆發着腎虧無能，精力渙散，發育不全，機能喪失，以及腦脹頭痛，健忘失眠，腰酸背痛，肢體疲憊等神經衰弱症象。則雖有如花美眷，亦全不發生興趣，但夫婦之道，捨不了靈肉關係，妻子當感覺寂寞之時，懷着滿腔熱情，丈夫若不能予以安慰，她怎能不失望地惱恨呢？在這種情形之下，夫婦間即不免發生一種不快的陰霾，這種陰霾，如不速謀掃除，會逐漸的昏暗下來，把他整個前途的光明和幸福吞沒淨盡！此外，在職業上亦因身體過弱，如何能心計巧算，耐勞克苦，在成功的途徑上邁進？必陷於失業窮困，家累重重！人生至此境地，其困苦之狀，殊有難以言喻者！

Extravagance after marriage, indulgence, and excessive worry damage the body, leading to exhaustion of essence and blood, resulting in kidney deficiency and impotence, scattered energy, incomplete development, loss of function, as well as symptoms of neurasthenia such as brain distension, headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, lower back pain, and physical fatigue. Even with a beautiful wife, there is no interest. However, the relationship between husband and wife cannot be separated from the spiritual and physical connection. When the wife feels lonely and carries a full of passion, if the husband cannot comfort her, how can she not be disappointed and resentful? In this situation, an unpleasant haze will inevitably arise between the husband and wife. If this haze is not quickly dispelled, it will gradually darken, engulfing the light and happiness of his entire future! In addition, due to physical weakness, how can he be resourceful, hardworking, and persevering in his career to advance on the path to success? He will inevitably fall into unemployment, poverty, and heavy family burdens! The hardship of life in such a situation is difficult to describe!

但上述病症，並不是不治之症，在今日醫學昌明的世界，更有特殊療法，何為而不知自愛，長此受苦？特效療法，即必須速服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，因此劑係由雄壯動物體中提取的生殖腺素所製成，品質純粹，藥性溫和，補力偉大，於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，上述各症必可於短期內完全治愈。惟有遺精者，須兼服『希米脫氏固精片』，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速！

However, the above symptoms are not incurable. In today's world of advanced medicine, there are special treatments. Why not love yourself and suffer like this for a long time? The most effective treatment is to quickly take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" (Germinal Essence). This agent is made from gonadal hormones extracted from strong animals. It is pure in quality, mild in nature, and has great restorative power. After taking it, it can generate sperm, replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within a day and night. If you continue to take it, the above symptoms can be completely cured in a short period of time. Only those with spermatorrhea need to take "Hymeto Spermostatic Tablets" at the same time to strengthen the spermatic orifice and stop leakage, then the effect will be even faster!

青年通病遺精弊害的嚴重和治療  性病專科醫師詹念曾
The Seriousness and Treatment of Spermatorrhea, a Common Disease Among Young People: Venereology Specialist Zhan Nianceng

面黄肌瘦的青年人，據余治病經騐，十個中到有九個患遺精症，同時在十個遺精患者中，他們的病原，到有九個是起於自凟。自凟是青年人在春情發動期一種易犯的惡習，起始是因為體內荷爾蒙的刺激，和好奇心的衝動，但青年人的意志薄弱，明知其害，而不能制止二次三次的再犯。所以極易造成習慣。以後為『習慣成自然』的勢力所支配，惡習的改正甚難。及至年齡長大，經屢次的努力，終以戒絕了自凟惡癖，或减少了自瀆次數，但性機能已受摧殘，遺精症即繼之而起。

According to my medical experience, nine out of ten young people with sallow complexions and thin bodies suffer from spermatorrhea. At the same time, among ten patients with spermatorrhea, nine of them have their etiology originate from masturbation. Masturbation is an evil habit that young people easily fall into during the period of spring passion. It starts with the stimulation of hormones in the body and the impulse of curiosity, but young people's willpower is weak. Knowing the harm, they cannot stop themselves from repeating it two or three times. Therefore, it is very easy to form a habit. Later, dominated by the power of "habit becomes nature," it is very difficult to correct the bad habit. By the time they grow older, after repeated efforts, they finally quit the bad habit of masturbation or reduce the number of times of masturbation, but the sexual function has been damaged, and spermatorrhea then arises.

遺精一起，在我人體内最可寶貴的精液，就等於有了一個不能自主的漏巵．在初症象輕者，每於夜眠時因夢而遺，迨後無夢亦遺，白日亦遗，甚至在大小便時亦有將精液洩出者，這是由遺精加劇而至滑精與漏精了。江河之水雖日日東流，但水有循環，所以無乾涸之虞！今以生理上所產生少量的精液，而有如此大量的遺洩，能不枯竭？如精液枯竭，則必百病叢生。其最顯著者為腦衰體瘦，健忘失眠，心悸胆怯，腰酸背痛，腎虧無能，精力渙散，發育不全等症即不一而足。此種青年，如一旦結婚，不特在夫婦生活上不能盡其人道，致為妻憎恨，演出家庭間的悲滲！就是在職業上學術上亦如何能與人競爭，獲得優勝，必處於劣敗地位無疑！然遺精並不是不治之症，在今日昌明的醫藥界上，更有特效良藥的發明，即患者必须服『希米脫氏固精片』，則遺精即可根治，如因遺精己引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以培補腦腎，增益精血，必可於短期内完全恢復健康。若患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等科學療法，必可保證治愈。

Once spermatorrhea occurs, the most precious semen in our body is equivalent to having an uncontrollable leaking cup. In the early stages, those with mild symptoms will experience nocturnal emissions due to dreams. Later, they will experience emissions even without dreams, during the day, and even during bowel movements, which is the progression of spermatorrhea to spermatorrhea and seminal leakage. Although the water of rivers flows eastward every day, the water circulates, so there is no danger of drying up! Now, with the small amount of semen produced physiologically, there is such a large amount of leakage, can it not be exhausted? If the semen is exhausted, hundreds of diseases will inevitably arise. The most obvious are brain decay and thin body, forgetfulness and insomnia, palpitations and timidity, lower back pain, kidney deficiency and impotence, scattered energy, and incomplete development. If such a young man marries, not only will he not be able to fulfill his responsibilities in married life, causing his wife to hate him and leading to family tragedies! How can he compete with others and win in his career and studies? He will inevitably be at a disadvantage! However, spermatorrhea is not an incurable disease. In today's advanced medical community, there are even more effective medicines invented, that is, the patient must take "Hymeto Spermostatic Tablets", then spermatorrhea can be cured radically. If spermatorrhea has caused the above symptoms, you must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" to cultivate the brain and kidneys and increase the essence and blood, you will definitely be able to fully restore your health in a short period of time. If patients can personally come to this clinic for diagnosis by expert doctors, and then use scientific therapies such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

女性的乳峯萎癟　有妨健美和幸福  美國醫學博士姚崇培
Atrophied Breasts in Women Hinder Health, Beauty, and Happiness: Yao Chongpei, MD, American Medical Doctor

據世界著名的生理學家兼美容專家Kamdeaning康德林，與婦科專家Donpison湯潑遜等在法國最近出版的一份『健康公報』上說『：女性的性情所以會孤僻，容顏所以會憔悴，曲線毫無。而與丈夫不和，或終身不獲一育，或難育而養育困難，這可說與胸前的一對乳峯，有着極大關係，如果聰明的丈夫，能夠體會到這些，及時運用進步的醫藥，使他夫人的乳峯高聳而有彈性，那我相信世界上夫婦勃　的事情，或甚至離婚的事情，一定可以減少，並且還能夠多生育幾個活潑伶俐的子女呢』。這段議論，真是含有至理，有功社會的不朽之作。

According to a recent "Health Bulletin" published in France by world-renowned physiologist and beauty expert Kamdeaning and gynecologist Donpison, "A woman's temperament becomes aloof, her appearance becomes haggard, and she has no curves. Discord with her husband, failure to conceive throughout her life, or difficulty conceiving and raising children are all closely related to the pair of breasts on her chest. If a smart husband can understand these points and use advanced medicine in a timely manner to make his wife's breasts tall and elastic, then I believe that conflicts between couples or even divorces in the world will definitely be reduced, and they will be able to give birth to several lively and intelligent children." This argument truly contains profound truths and is an immortal work that contributes to society.

按康湯諸氏的所有要這樣重視乳峯，便因為乳峯高聳而有彈性的女性，她們的卵巢機能必健全，新陳代謝作用必旺盛，所以臀部豐腴，曲線美妙，同時更因血液循臟的充暢，容顏自然嬌豔，性情亦復謙和而柔順，此種女性在家庭裏每為丈夫視同壞寶，雙方情愛彌　，生育還成什麼問題。反之，一個女子而如果乳峯萎癟，那不管她年紀怎樣輕，大都失去健美幸福，同時並罹白帶及月經不調等症，自然不能生育壯健的子女，甚至喪失受孕的能力，即使受孕，產生下來的胎兒，非但養育困難，且因母體的衰弱，其死亡也特別容易！

The reason why Kang and Tang and others place so much emphasis on breasts is that women with tall and elastic breasts must have healthy ovarian function and vigorous metabolism, so their hips are plump, their curves are beautiful, and because of the smooth blood circulation, their appearance is naturally delicate and their temperament is also humble and gentle. Such women are regarded as treasures by their husbands in the family, their love is even deeper, and what problem is there with childbirth? On the other hand, if a woman's breasts are atrophied, no matter how young she is, she will mostly lose her health, beauty, and happiness, and at the same time suffer from leukorrhea and irregular menstruation, etc., and naturally cannot give birth to strong children, or even lose the ability to conceive. Even if she conceives, the resulting fetus will not only be difficult to raise, but also because of the weakness of the mother, its death is particularly easy!

基於這兩個比例，足見乳峯在女性健美的上的重要了，然則已有此種缺陷的女性，將怎樣以謀補救呢？余曰：當遵康湯諸氏的建議，運用最新醫藥，最新醫藥為何？此不待言，即為中西醫師一致推荐的卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』了，此劑服後於一日間即能培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，使一切白帶不感，宮冷不　諸症，似燃犀燭怪，頃刻驅除淨盡，短期恢復女性應有的健美，而使乳峯高高聳起，姿態動人。

Based on these two ratios, it is enough to see the importance of breasts in the health and beauty of women. So, how can women who already have this defect seek remedy? I say: You should follow the advice of Kang and Tang and others and use the latest medicine. What is the latest medicine? Needless to say, it is the ovarian preparation for women "Shengzhisu" (Germinal Essence) unanimously recommended by Chinese and Western doctors. After taking this agent, it can cultivate ovarian function, enhance metabolism, and regulate menstruation within a day, making all leukorrhea insensitive and eliminating palace cold and other symptoms like burning a rhino horn to illuminate monsters, driving them away in an instant, and restoring the health and beauty that women should have in a short period of time, and making the breasts stand tall and moving.

我的白濁為何不愈？
Why Does My Leukorrhea Not Heal?

余於白濁的臨床上，已有十餘年之經驗，治療之人，何止千萬，而許多淋病患者，往往請余治療時，必詢余『我的白濁，何以不愈』，因為許多患者，經過長時期之痛苦，多方面之醫治，（包括內服藥，電療，打针，手術）總難望其根治。往往由失望而灰心，由灰心而放縱，結果，本來可以根治之老白濁，反而成為不能治之痼疾矣!豈非陷病人於萬劫不復之境？是不可不速行補救，使其早日恢復康健之途。茲試言其故：原來一班失治之淋病，約有三因，一為誤服市上劣藥，二為誤被庸陋而設備不完之醫家之誤治（亦包括誤用手術，及打針，服藥，電療等）。第三為病家不知攝生，一味肆行無忌。皆為使淋病久洽不愈，或者可說愈治而淋病愈頑固也。

I have more than ten years of experience in the clinic of leukorrhea, and I have treated no less than tens of thousands of people. Many gonorrhea patients often ask me when asking me for treatment, "Why doesn't my leukorrhea heal?" Because many patients have undergone long-term suffering and various treatments (including internal medicine, electrotherapy, injections, and surgery), it is always difficult to hope for a radical cure. Often from disappointment to discouragement, from discouragement to indulgence, as a result, the old leukorrhea that could have been cured has become an incurable disease! Isn't this putting the patient in a state of eternal ruin? It is imperative to take remedial action as soon as possible so that they can return to the path of health as soon as possible. Now try to say the reason: Originally, there are about three reasons for a group of gonorrhea that is not cured: one is mistakenly taking inferior medicines on the market, and the second is being wrongly treated by mediocre doctors with incomplete equipment (including misuse of surgery, injections, medicine, electrotherapy, etc.). The third is that the patient does not know how to maintain health and recklessly indulges himself. All of these cause gonorrhea to be incurable for a long time, or it can be said that the more treatment, the more stubborn the gonorrhea becomes.

由此言之，要求老白濁治愈，必先具有補救上述三種原因。由精密的科學方法診斷，如尿道鏡，膀胱鏡，顯微鏡等，為之檢察病情，然後用德國樂根納博士所發明之濾淋平流電療法，或行局部之放射電流，或用電管插入尿道，使所有深部或局部之淋菌，完全撲滅。並濾清其毒素（按一般電療，僅有少許殺菌作用，絕對無濾清淋毒作用，讀者宜注意！）更佐以希氏血清，電氣按摩，台維氏新式菩齊，特製自家菌苗等，隨症治療，則不僅頑固之慢性淋可治，舉凡急慢性淋中之前後尿道炎，攝護腺炎，睾丸炎，精囊炎，關節炎等，均可應手取效。

From this, it can be said that in order to cure old leukorrhea, you must first have remedies for the above three reasons. Diagnose with precise scientific methods, such as ureteroscopy, cystoscopy, and microscopy, to examine the condition, and then use the "Lulin Parallel Flow Electrotherapy" invented by Dr. Legener of Germany, or perform local radiation current, or insert an electric tube into the urethra to completely eliminate all deep or local gonococci. And filter out its toxins (note that general electrotherapy only has a slight bactericidal effect, and there is absolutely no effect of filtering out gonococcal toxins, readers should pay attention!) Assisted by His serum, electrical massage, David's new-style "Pu Qi", and specially made homemade bacterial vaccines, etc., treat according to the symptoms, then not only stubborn chronic gonorrhea can be cured, but also acute and chronic anterior and posterior urethritis, prostatitis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, arthritis, etc., can all be effective.

Refugee Zhang Boyuan's Death from Beating: Police Lawyer's Indignant Prosecution: Stealing in the Name of Charity, Engaging in Corruption and Favoritism, No Different Than Cannibalism: Shen Zhiguang and Others Should Be Severely Punished with the Maximum Penalty

Shanghai Charity Organization United Relief Association, Pudong Building Branch, located at the No. 42 Refugee Camp in Xuhui, Fahuazhen: The director and staff members, Shen Zhiguang, Song Meixi, Cao Linsen, Cai Zuying, and Zhao Weiyun, were accused of inflating the number of refugees and embezzling refugee food. When refugee Zhang Boyuan and others reported the matter to the branch, Shen and the others, upon learning of this, subjected Zhang to private torture, causing him to be covered in injuries. Unable to endure the abuse, Zhang escaped over the wall at night. Due to the darkness, uneven road, and cold weather, and Zhang's old age, he could not endure it and collapsed and died on the road. This incident took some time to come to light before Chief Inspector Liu Shaokui and Detective Song Bingzheng of the Public Concession Police Department learned of it, arrested Shen and others, and sent them to the First Special Court. After several hearings, a suspicious incident of changing coffins and corpses occurred. The Special Court then applied to the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court for designated jurisdiction due to jurisdictional issues. The Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court has now designated the First Special Court to have jurisdiction. Therefore, yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide, accompanied by Clerk Ding Chongnan, continued the hearing in Criminal Court One. According to Detective Song's report, the investigation revealed that the defendants often inflated the number of refugees, and when representatives from the branch came to investigate, they used non-refugees to deceive the upper-level personnel. Subsequently, after a representative from the branch, Mr. Xie, presented the reports from the No. 42 Refugee Camp for November and December of last year, the court ordered the start of arguments. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, then prosecuted, stating that the case involved two parts: embezzlement of publicly held property and causing death by injury. He pointed out that the establishment of refugee camps by charitable organizations was inherently good, providing a place for helpless and starving refugees to live. However, the defendants engaged in corruption in this undertaking, which was no different from eating the flesh and blood of refugees. This kind of behavior, is it not cannibalism? Not only that, but it also chills the hearts of philanthropists who are happy to do good. Therefore, if the defendants are not severely punished, no one will be willing to do charitable work. Regarding the charge of causing death by injury, Zhang Boyuan, to preserve his life, risked leaving his hometown and came to Shanghai, entering the refugee camp to live a hard life. However, upon seeing the darkness of the officials, he angrily reported the matter and was subjected to unbearable abuse, resulting in his death. The prosecution would rather Zhang Boyuan die under the fire of weapons than die at the hands of charitable organization staff members through abuse. Because the current death is enough to affect the public's desire to do good. In short, the behavior of the defendants not only treats human life as child's play but also affects the hearts of the people in society. The court should impose the maximum penalty in addition to imposing a heavier sentence to maintain discipline and deter future offenders. During the prosecution, Lawyer Ru's indignant state aroused sympathy from the audience. After the defendant's lawyer's defense, the court announced the conclusion and scheduled sentencing. The defendants were all returned to custody.

Shenchang Foreign Firm Sues Brick and Ash Company for Receiving and Selling Stolen Mud: Trial Concludes: Defendant's Lawyer Actually Calls It "Spoils of War"

The Longhua Shanghai Cement Factory, managed by the German firm Shenchang Foreign Firm, was forcibly occupied by the Japanese. All the inventory was then transported and sold. Later, the raw materials and materials stored in the factory were used to start production without permission. The cement produced was still sold in the market under the name of the domestic Elephant brand. Fearing that the outside world would be deceived, Shenchang Foreign Firm published statements in Chinese and foreign newspapers to clarify the facts and warned all sectors not to purchase the stolen goods. Later, it was discovered that ten brick and ash companies, including Yantai, Huiyuan, Xiangtailai,

### Following Guidance from the Rice Industry Market, Approximately Five to Six Thousand Bags of Rice are Transported to Shanghai Daily; the Japanese Puppets Plan to Levy Heavy Taxes but Cancel After Vigorous Efforts

Shanghai's rice prices, after the market's best efforts to suppress them, have gradually stabilized. Merchants from various regions have successively resumed their transport operations, with approximately five to six thousand bags of rice arriving in Shanghai daily via land and water routes. The Japanese puppet regime planned to increase rice taxes, but after protests from mainland rice merchants, the plan was not implemented. A reporter from the Modern News Agency has investigated and reported the situation as follows:

Merchants from Various Regions Resume Transport Operations

The rice industry market, in accordance with the resolutions of the Soy and Rice Trade Association, strictly enforced price limits and suppressed hoarding by large households and manipulation by merchants. Market prices have returned to normal. Merchants from Changshu, Wuxi, Kunshan, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Zhangyan, Tongli, Bachi, and other regions, after earnest persuasion by the Market Management Committee, have successively resumed transport operations. At the same time, Shanghai rice merchants are also sending personnel directly to the producing areas to handle transport procedures for rice purchased from the mainland.

Rice Transport to Shanghai Gradually Increases

According to an investigation by a Modern News Agency reporter among rice transport merchant groups in this city yesterday, approximately five to six thousand bags of rice are being transported to Shanghai from the mainland daily. Most of these are transported by train, while the number transported by Yangtze River freighters and inland river boats directly to Shanghai is very small. It is reported that most of this rice was pre-purchased by Shanghai rice merchants before the end of the lunar year. Transport has been difficult in recent days due to cloudy and rainy weather, but the supply from the mainland should increase when the weather clears.

Japanese Puppet Tax Increase Vigorously Opposed and Canceled

The Japanese puppet regime, in order to plunder the economy, has concocted various pretexts to increase various exorbitant taxes and levies, especially on rice, increasing the "landing tax" by five jiao per shi (unit of dry measure). It was originally planned to be implemented on March 1st, but after mainland rice merchants, considering the impact on people's food, jointly protested to the Japanese puppet "organs," it has been canceled. As for the "removal tax" and "import tax" illegally implemented by the Japanese puppets, they are still being collected as usual.

### Guerrillas Repeatedly Capture Guns and Weapons from Bandits; Zhang Miaogen's Whereabouts Unknown; Japanese Sentries Retreat Every Night

In the Pudong South District and the area along the Shangnan Railway Line, because the guerrillas are preparing to engage in a sweeping operation against the Japanese bandits, they are dispatched every night to investigate the bandits' whereabouts. In the past few days, there have been occasional contacts, and several batches of guns and weapons have been seized from the bandits. Fearing that the guerrillas would penetrate deep into their security zone, the Japanese are extremely panicked. In addition to completely withdrawing sentries from various locations at night and concentrating their defense in one place, they have intensified their strict searches of pedestrians on various main roads during the day. According to rumors, Zhang Miaogen, the company commander of the guerrilla detachment in the Beicai area, has fallen into the hands of the bandits and his whereabouts are unknown, but it is not certain.

### More Than Three Thousand Bags of Cotton from Eastern Zhejiang are Transported to Shanghai; For Use by Chinese Cotton Mills

The Ministry of Finance recently issued an order to re-prohibit the transport of stored cotton from Eastern Zhejiang to Shanghai. Those who have already been issued certificates by the Chamber of Commerce are still allowed to transport. Currently, cotton mills in the concessions of this city, such as Qinfeng, Xinyu, Xinhe, Xieji, Tongyi, and Hongzhang, have shipped 3,855 bales of cotton to Shanghai in two batches, with certificates from the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, for their own use.

The Kangshayi freighter of the Italian-Chinese Company of Italy has now been approved by the Commander-in-Chief of the Tenth Army Group to load cotton in Ningbo and sail to Shanghai, limited to three times. It is reported that the transport company has completed the registration procedures and will soon sail the Shanghai-Ningbo line in compliance with the order.

### The Four Banks' Call Loans Amount to Approximately 15 Million Yuan by the End of February; A Decrease of One Million Yuan Compared to January

The Shanghai Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Four Banks' Call Loan Commission, in order to regulate finance and support industry and commerce, has achieved considerable success since handling call loans. The loan balance in February was approximately 16 million yuan in national currency, of which 4.1% was transferred by the Bank Industry Joint Reserve Association and 3.7% was transferred by the Money Industry Joint Reserve Treasury. The loan balance in February was approximately 15 million yuan in national currency, of which 3.6% was transferred by the Bank Industry Joint Reserve Association and 3.9% was transferred by the Money Industry Joint Reserve Treasury. The end of last month was after the major closure of various industries, so the balance was greatly reduced, reaching as much as one million yuan.

### Public Concession Implements Street Searches of Women; Female Inspectors Performed Their Duties Yesterday; The Purpose is to Prevent Concealment of Weapons

The Shanghai Times reports that yesterday (the 8th), according to senior officials of the Public Concession Police Department, female inspectors will join patrol teams to conduct inspections in the Central and Western Districts from today. It is reported that 24 female inspectors have already carried out their duties yesterday. This move indicates another step in the Concession's efforts to deal with terrorists and armed criminals. Twelve female inspectors have been active in the Western District since early morning, and searches are particularly strict in the area of Difeng Road, Great Western Road, and Yuyuan Road. Another twelve in the Central District are working with patrol teams on the Bund, inspecting women landing from ships and ferries. They also board trams and buses to carry out inspections. Street searches of women are rare in Shanghai. In the past, female suspects were always searched after being taken to the nearest police station. However, given that women often carry weapons and other military equipment belonging to criminals, a street search system has been established. This is part of the Public Concession's efforts to combat terrorists. Japanese naval soldiers often inspect Chinese entering Hongkou across the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, and men and women are searched. However, the Public Concession's position is slightly different, so the Municipal Council has decided to send female inspectors to the police stations to go out for inspections with street search teams for better results. The results of this new method have not yet been officially revealed yesterday, but even if weapons and other items have not yet been accurately seized, the fact that they will be inspected by patrol officers accompanied by White Russian merchant groups and will often go to various hotels and districts for searches will prove to be an important factor in the current movement.

### The New Sound Japanese Army in Pudong Suffers Another Major Loss; Guerrillas Once Broke Through the Outskirts; The Japanese Army Actually Tore Down Bridges and Held On

Xinchang Town in Pudong is now the battlefield between the guerrillas and the Japanese army. They have held each other for more than twenty days, and the Japanese army has been defeated five times. The two sides are facing each other across the Erzao Port. Last night (the 7th), at about 10 p.m., the guerrillas launched a fierce assault on the Japanese army, and the Japanese army was defeated. The guerrillas broke through the Japanese army's outer defense line, and the Japanese army, based in the Wangjia Garden Command Headquarters, overflowed with small steel cannons and heavy machine guns, firing more than a thousand rounds to prevent the Chinese army from advancing. However, the Chinese army commanders braved the gunfire and advanced. The Japanese army was in a hurry and completely blew up the Dahe Bridge in Xinchang, so the guerrillas were blocked on the east bank of the river and then lured the Japanese army across the river, consuming a large amount of ammunition. By 5 a.m. on the 8th, after seven hours of shooting, the Japanese army lost more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. In this battle, more than ten Japanese soldiers were annihilated.

### Frugality to Save Lives, Important Suggestions, Requesting Readers to Do it Conscientiously

The Frugality to Save Lives Committee recently issued 70 suggestions for frugality to save lives and important announcements as follows. We sincerely ask you, no matter how busy you are, to read these "70 Suggestions for Frugality to Save Lives" and do the feasible ones conscientiously. Use the money saved to help the pitiful refugees. Make fewer phone calls, save a little tap water, reduce the wattage of some lights, and save on any aspect of harmony. It doesn't matter how much money you have (it would be better if you have more), as long as you have perseverance, from the 1st to the 5th of each month, send the money you saved last month to the major banks under the name of a certain account by phone, and pay it into the savings and relief funds, and get a receipt. If you can save one yuan each month, you have already saved a refugee's life for half a month. By doing this kind of work, you will surely feel at peace and have immeasurable blessings.

Fundraising and Charity Sale Proceed Simultaneously; The Fundraising Committee of the Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group recently received a letter from the Knitting Industry Association stating that the industry recently held a meeting to discuss fundraising for refugee relief expenses. It was decided that all knitting industry workers would donate two corners per person to help the disaster. After collection, they will report to the Association. This move is very meaningful. If all workers in the city can fully implement it, the number will be considerable. Before wealthy merchants, intellectuals, and freelance professionals have widely promoted disaster relief, the industry's workers were able to generously donate. It is really not easy, so it has been decided to hold a charity sale, which all sectors have praised and expect to be very effective. The Chinese Professional Women's Club of this city recently sent a letter to the Association, expressing its willingness to participate in this work to fulfill its national responsibilities. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00, Ms. Wu Meiji Ruobing, as a representative, went to the Association to discuss the promotion of the charity sale. Director Ma Shaoquan and General Secretary Sun Mingqi received them and exchanged many views on promoting the charity sale.

Performing Arts and Broadcasting Staff Elected; The Performing Arts and Broadcasting Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Civic Group held its first standing committee meeting yesterday at noon. Association representatives Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, and Fang Jiaobo, and more than 50 members of the committee attended. First, the committee chairman Zhou Bangjun reported on the establishment process and future work guidelines. Then Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, Xi Yushu, Zhang Deqin, Ye Er, Chen Jicheng, Wang Wanbai, and others successively delivered speeches, unanimously expressing their gratitude for the past support of the performing arts community for disaster relief work. Zhang Yeer, Liu Ziyun, Huang Zhaolin, and Chen Zizhen were elected as vice chairmen, Ge Futian as general secretary, and Wu Baoqing, Yang Jingwen, Liu Chongzhi, and Zhuang Haiquan as deputy general secretaries. Le Gengbao and Liu Zhongying were appointed as directors of the general affairs department, Wu Wanbai and Ge Chunsun as directors of the lighting department, Zhu Yaoxiang and You Hensheng as directors of the performing arts department, Li Zhuan and Zhang Renxin as directors of the publicity department, and Gu Wenzai and Jiang Xiaoxiao as directors of the public relations department. The directors of the various groups of the performing arts department were appointed as follows: Yan Deyi for the singing group, Huang Zhaolin for the Pinghua group, Wei Yuqing (Guangyu Society) and He Yunfang (Puyu Society) for the Tanci group, Gu Leiyin for the Siming Opera group, Shen Linsheng for the Shenqu group, Li Zhuan for the storytelling group, Zhang Renxin for the Siming storytelling group, He Guisun for the Sutan group, Fang Renmi for the acrobatics group, Wang Peigen for the Changxi opera group, Wang Baoqing for the Suzhou book group, Shi Lingtong for the Yangzhou opera group, Xie Biyun for the Yue opera group, Chen Weiliang for the Southern opera group, and Huang Yinchu for the Cantonese opera group. Finally, it was unanimously resolved that all performing arts and broadcasting workers in the city would be united to continue their efforts to assist in the relief work.
