### Joint Anglo-French Ultimatum to Germany: Demanding a Halt to Military Aggression and Guaranteeing the Withdrawal of German Troops from Polish Territory, Otherwise Recalling Ambassadors and Implementing Aid to Poland

London - British Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that the British and French governments have notified Germany that if the German government is not prepared to halt all acts of aggression against Poland and provide a satisfactory guarantee for the withdrawal of German troops from Polish territory, then the two countries will, without hesitation, fulfill their commitment to aid Poland. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

London - The British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop this evening, demanding a halt to the acts of aggression and ordering troops to withdraw from Polish territory. He stated that if this were not done, Britain would have no choice but to fulfill its obligations and aid Poland, and requested that the German government issue him a passport so that he could immediately return to his country. (Havas dispatch, 1st)

Paris - The French Ambassador to Germany, Robert Coulondre, visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at 10 p.m. last night, demanding an immediate cessation of aggression and ordering the withdrawal of German troops from Poland. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop immediately replied that Germany was not responsible for the aggression and that he would forward the ambassador's statements to Führer Hitler for review. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

London - Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that as of 11 a.m. today, the British government had not yet received a response from Germany to the ultimatum that the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, delivered to the German government yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

Berlin - Well-informed sources here claim that after the British and French ambassadors to Germany presented their notes to the German government last night, Germany will submit a reply in letter form today. (Haitong dispatch, 2nd)

London - After the British and French ambassadors to Germany visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, demanding an immediate cessation of aggression and ordering the withdrawal of German troops from Poland, no formal answer has been received as of noon today. There is also no official news on how Germany will respond. According to private sources, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has already presented the matter to Führer Hitler for review and told the British and French ambassadors that Poland had repeatedly and resolutely violated the German border, and that the aggressor was Poland, not Germany. Political figures here consider this to be absurd, arguing instead that Germany clearly intended to invade and had provoked Poland. This can be seen from all the measures taken by the country in recent days and from the simultaneous attack by German troops on Poland in three locations. In short, if Germany does not provide a definite answer to Britain and France, the British government is determined to fulfill its accepted obligation and come to the aid of Poland. This has been repeatedly emphasized by Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

Berlin - The Polish Ambassador to Germany, Lipski, left here this morning. Other embassy staff have not left. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

### Chamberlain Warns Germany: Britain is Fully Prepared, Determined to Fulfill Guarantee Obligations, Should Hitler Remain Obstinate, He Alone Will Bear the Responsibility for the War

London - Last night, British Prime Minister Chamberlain made his highly anticipated speech in the House of Commons. The most important point was his announcement that Britain and France had notified Germany that if it did not immediately cease all acts of aggression against Poland and withdraw its troops from Polish territory, then Britain and France would support Poland with all their might. If Germany's response to this warning is not satisfactory, the British Ambassador to Germany will lower the flag and return home, and we will fight with the determination to see it through to the end in a battle that we originally wished to avoid. The Prime Minister also said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's efforts to mediate peace were admirable, but Hitler bears full responsibility for creating this catastrophe. Hitler did not hesitate to plunge the world into war in order to satisfy his unconscious ambitions. Britain has no complaints against the German people. The only fault of the German people is that they allowed themselves to be dominated by the Nazi government.

The House of Commons was extremely crowded, with almost no empty seats, and the public galleries were also full. When the Prime Minister and Labour Party leader Greenwood entered the chamber, there was great applause. The Prime Minister then rose to speak, and the entire chamber listened in silence.

The Prime Minister began by saying, "I do not intend to say much tonight. This is now a time for action, not empty words. Eighteen months ago, I had hoped that the responsibility for subjecting Britain to the terrible arbitration of war would not fall on my shoulders. Now, I fear that I will not be able to avoid this responsibility. But the circumstances regarding where my responsibility lies have never been clearer than today. I have made it clear to the German government in every way that if it must resort to force again as it has done before, then we have no choice but to resist with force. Now that all the documents have been published, we will await the judgment of history. We know that one person alone bears the responsibility for this catastrophe (applause). That is Hitler, who does not hesitate to plunge the world into disaster in order to satisfy his unconscious ambitions (applause)."

The Prime Minister continued that the House of Commons had not asked the government to publish information during the negotiations, and this patience was appreciated. Now, the correspondence with the German government has been published in its entirety. From this, it can be seen that Britain's aim was to promote discussions between Germany and Poland on an equal footing regarding their disputes, and to achieve a solution that would guarantee Poland's independence and be internationally guaranteed. The communique issued on August 30 contained a passage that made clear that if the German government had any intention of a peaceful resolution, then the final conflict could easily have been avoided. In this communique, the British government fully acknowledged the need to initiate discussions immediately and also recognized Hitler's concern that the two countries' troops were standing close to each other. Therefore, it argued that both sides should undertake to refrain from military action during the negotiation period. The British government was confident that if the German government gave this undertaking, the British government could obtain the same undertaking from Poland. On August 31, the Polish government replied that it was prepared to provide security on a reciprocal basis, and that Polish troops would not violate the German border during the negotiations. However, the German government did not respond to this proposal. Otherwise, why did the war break out this morning?

The Prime Minister went on to say that in the broadcast issued by the German side before the invasion of Poland, there was a statement that the German government, in this environment, considered its proposal to have been rejected. The Prime Minister said that the German government's proposal was not sent to Poland by Germany. On August 29, the German government still said that it intended to draw up a proposal acceptable to them in order to resolve the dispute and, if possible, submit it to the British government to await the arrival of Polish negotiators. We waited a long time for the German proposal, and the British Ambassador to Germany also strongly urged German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to invite the Polish Ambassador to come and receive the German proposal to forward it to the Polish government. However, the German Foreign Minister spoke rudely, saying that he would never invite the Polish Ambassador to come, but that if the Polish Ambassador requested a meeting on his own initiative, the situation would be different. Seeing this situation, it seems that Germany considers Poland to be at fault because it did not negotiate with Germany on a proposal whose contents it knew nothing about. On Wednesday night, the German Foreign Minister took out a long document and read it aloud in German. The British Ambassador naturally asked for a copy, but the German Foreign Minister replied that the Polish representative had not arrived in Berlin by midnight, so it was too late. As a result, we did not receive a copy of the German proposal until last night, when we heard its contents from a broadcast in Berlin. Germany's so-called negotiators said that the Polish representative should arrive in Berlin immediately upon request and receive demands that must be accepted in their entirety. In fact, the proper course, in our view, was for this proposal to have been submitted to Poland long ago, allowing it time to consider it and allowing it to express its opinion that the German proposal was undermining the important interests of Germany that it had previously stated it respected. The Polish Ambassador met with Ribbentrop last night and told him that Poland was willing to engage in negotiations on an equal footing. Germany replied that German troops had crossed the border at dawn today and were said to have bombed various towns. In this situation, there is only one course of action available to us (applause). The British and French Ambassadors to Germany have now been ordered to send the following communication to the German government:

"The German Chancellor's declaration to the German Army this morning makes it clear that he will attack Poland. The British and French governments have just received information indicating that German troops have crossed the Polish border and are now engaged in an offensive. In this situation, the British and French governments feel that the German government's actions have created the following state of affairs, namely, an act of armed aggression against Poland that threatens Poland's independence. In order to fulfill the guarantees given to Poland, the British and French governments have no choice but to come to its aid. We hereby inform Your Excellency that unless the German government gives our government a satisfactory guarantee, stating that the German government will cease its acts of aggression against Poland and prepare to immediately withdraw its troops from Polish territory, our government will not hesitate to fulfill its obligations."

The Prime Minister continued to tell the House of Commons, "If the German government's response to this final warning is not satisfactory, then the British Ambassador has been ordered to obtain his passport from the German government. I do not think that the German government will not do so. If so, then we are all prepared." The Prime Minister then announced that all the defensive preparations taken by the British government have been published, and added, "At this moment, we must recall 1914 and compare our current position with that time. Where do we stand now? The answer is that the army, navy, and air force are all ready for battle. The situation in all aspects is more favorable and reassuring than in 1914. The most gratifying and important event seen today is that there is no need for a general appeal for conscription, such as the appeal made by Lord Kitchener twenty-five years ago." The Prime Minister then spoke of the future, saying, "We are now facing a difficult task. We will be able to draw on our past experience, so we must now do our best to organize our manpower on a systematic, just, and economical basis. Therefore, the government has immediately proposed legislation to achieve this goal. A bill will be introduced in the House of Commons that, for the sake of realism, will expand the Military Training Act, requiring all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 41 to serve in the military. Measures will be taken to exempt the manpower required by industry from conscription." The Prime Minister then stated that Mussolini had also done his best in the recent crisis to seek a peaceful solution. He and the government were satisfied (applause).

The Prime Minister concluded, "Now, we have no choice but to grit our teeth and join the battle that we have tried so hard to avoid, and with the determination to achieve our goals. We will join the battle with a clear conscience and with the aid of the Dominions and the British Empire, and with the moral approval of most of the world. We have no quarrel with the German people unless they allow themselves to be ruled by the Nazi government. As long as the Nazi government continues to exist and continues its consistent methods of the past two years, there will be no peace in Europe. We have decided that these methods must end. If we can use this battle to re-establish the rules of trust in the world and eliminate force, then even if we make sacrifices, it will be worth it." (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)

### French Premier Hopes Hitler Restrains Violence with Reason, Otherwise He Will Not Hesitate to Use Force to Confront It; Guarantees Provided by Germany Have No Value

Paris - The Chamber of Deputies reconvened this afternoon, chaired by Speaker Herriot. Prime Minister Daladier immediately gave a speech, stating briefly, "The efforts of various countries to maintain peace were suddenly dashed by Germany. The various proposals put forward by that country, it is said, have been rejected by the government of Poland. This is a lie. In fact, Poland knows nothing about this proposal. What we value is how the German leader Hitler acts, not what he says. As for Poland, it has been an ally of our country since 1921, and the obligations we have accepted have been repeatedly strengthened. Our country and Britain have signed a mutual assistance treaty with that country, and we have no intention of abandoning it, nor can we bear to see our friendly country destroyed. The actions of Führer Hitler towards that country are another step by a dictator attempting to dominate the world. Our country is forced into this situation. Both national honor and the vital interests of national survival are involved. I dare to ask the French nation and the nations of the world, 'Since Germany has broken its promises to Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, what value do its guarantees to our provinces of Alsace and Lorraine have?' We French people have no hatred for the German people (all members cheered), but we are also well aware that France is in a critical autumn and are willing to do our best to fight for France's survival. On the other hand, if our authorities want to take adventurous actions and implement general mobilization, the people of the whole country will never obey. At this time, our duty lies in stopping violent actions. It would be good if we could achieve this goal by peaceful means, but if the aggressor has lost his mind, then we will not hesitate to resort to force. Members of Parliament, the power to issue orders lies with France." At this point, Prime Minister Daladier expressed his respect for the noble efforts made by the Italian government to replace violence with peaceful means, saying, "If that government continues its mediation, we are prepared to support it." Prime Minister Daladier then read out President Lebrun's message, which stated briefly, "War has already broken out in Central Europe. Germany suddenly attacked Poland while negotiations were still possible. Britain and France have made every effort to stop the war, but to no avail. If the German and Polish nations still cannot listen to the call of conscience of the world, then the war will never end. As for France, it must fulfill all its obligations (all members cheered). We must unite in good faith. Long live France!" All those present cheered wildly for a long time. (Havas dispatch, 1st)

### Who is the Culprit? Hitler Rebuts Roosevelt's Accusation Against Poland; Polish Government Declares Germany Suddenly Started the War

Washington - President Roosevelt telegraphed German Führer Hitler on the 25th and 26th of last month, calling for peace. The German Chargé d'Affaires, Thomsen, recently delivered a reply in the name of Führer Hitler to Secretary of State Hull. However, the wording was made by the Chargé d'Affaires himself. It said, "I have been ordered by my government to request Your Excellency to convey to Your Excellency the President that my country's leader greatly admires the two telegrams of the 25th and 26th of last month. My country's leader has made every effort to seek a friendly solution to the dispute between Germany and Poland. Even at the last minute, he accepted the mediation of the British government. Unfortunately, Poland's attitude was extremely stubborn, and all efforts have been declared a failure." (Havas dispatch, 1st)

Warsaw - The government has just issued a communique stating that Ambassador Lipski visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the evening of yesterday, the 31st, for talks and informed him that the Polish government had accepted the British offer of mediation. However, the German government announced its sixteen proposals by radio in a manner similar to the Ems Dispatch. "These demands are not acceptable to any government, and the intention of Germany in putting forward these proposals was to create an excuse to begin hostilities. This can be seen from the fact that it sent troops to invade only a few hours after putting forward the proposals. The Polish government has repeatedly stated that it is always prepared to seek a solution to the Danzig issue and the relations between Germany and Poland through mediation. It can be seen that the responsibility for the current events should be borne by Germany." As for the rumors that Polish troops had invaded the German border, they are absolutely untrue.

Editorial

### European Turmoil and Italy

Yesterday's discussion covered the general international situation following Germany's attack on Poland, as well as the impact on the Far East and China's War of Resistance. Today, we will focus on Italy and continue our discussion of the European situation. Before discussing the European situation, let us first mention two news items related to China, which are worth pondering despite the disruption of the overall situation. (1) The new Soviet Ambassador to China, Mr. Panyushkin, has been in Chongqing for quite some time, but various parties have kept it a secret. However, on the previous day, September 1st, it was suddenly reported that he had visited the Chairman and presented his credentials. In his speech, he made two statements: one, that Soviet aid to China's War of Resistance was not empty talk; and two, that he would take it as his responsibility to develop and strengthen cooperation between China and the Soviet Union upon taking office. Ambassadors usually make speeches upon arrival, and these speeches usually focus on fostering good relations between countries. Some even embellish them with local scenery. For example, if they come to China, they will praise the heroism and sympathy of the War of Resistance. However, the words of the new Soviet Ambassador are not as general as the usual practice. (2) The new British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, just presented his credentials. His mission is naturally between Britain and the United States. However, he gave a speech to reporters the day before yesterday, not saying anything about how things would be between Britain and the United States, but rather stating that British Far Eastern policy still adheres to the Nine-Power Treaty and that the situation has changed greatly in the past twenty-five years, and that while there was once an Anglo-Japanese alliance, there is now the Nine-Power Treaty. It should be no accident that the British Ambassador to the United States frankly discussed Far Eastern policy in his first public speech. Considering these two points, readers can be more at ease to quietly observe the evolution of the European situation!

When discussing the European situation, let us first recognize the facts at the current stage. By "current stage," we mean relying solely on the information obtained by the reporter at the time of writing. There are four main points: (1) German troops are attacking Poland from multiple directions. Judging from their military strategy, it seems to be based on political objectives. Therefore, their main force is approaching the Polish Corridor. (2) The German side has neither accepted nor rejected the modified Ems Dispatch that the British and French ambassadors to Germany presented to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (The rumors of rejection have not been confirmed by official announcements.) Therefore, the requests of the two ambassadors to sign their passports and return home should be pending. (3) US President Roosevelt has not yet recognized that a state of war has been established due to the German attack on Poland. Therefore, the Congress that needs to be convened to amend the Neutrality Act has not yet made a decision. However, while various parties indiscriminately refer to the German-Polish situation as "hostile actions," President Roosevelt refers to it as the "German invasion of Poland." This single word of criticism demonstrates the serious attitude of the United States. US Ambassador to Germany Wilson, who was on vacation in the United States, was previously rumored to be returning to his post soon, but suddenly resigned yesterday and was immediately approved. The US government not only stated that Wilson was being transferred to an important position in the State Department, but also said that it would select a new replacement and had not yet made a decision. The meaning of this is to express abhorrence. In addition, there is ample evidence that the United States sympathizes with Britain and America. (4) Italy has declared that it will not initiate military action. The future European situation may have various imagined developments or various unimaginable evolutions, but the four points mentioned above will likely be important catalysts, and readers should pay close attention to them.

Regarding the Italian situation, it can be said to be a new development in the recent evolution. If the German-Polish issue escalates into a European war or a world war, then Italy will inevitably be caught in the whirlpool, which goes without saying. If it does not greatly escalate, then Italy's recent actions are vaguely forming an important role in cleaning up the European situation in the near future, and it will soon be viewed with new respect by the world. Readers must remember that during the First World War, Italy betrayed its allies Germany and Austria and joined the British and French group. Of course, future events should not be inferred from historical records in a "memorization" style.

Five or six days ago, this newspaper discussed European affairs and pointed out the ambiguous attitudes and actions of Germany and Italy as "there must be a special purpose in the final scene of diplomacy." In the past two days, the special purpose has begun to emerge. Germany and Italy have corresponded and supported each other in international affairs, and their deeds are countless. As they advanced from the Anti-Comintern Pact to the conclusion of a military alliance, the relations between the two countries truly reached a point of sharing weal and woe. Considering its greatest goal, it is directed towards Britain and France. Now that Germany has a conflict with Poland, and Britain and France are rising up to fulfill their obligations, it is the moment when Germany and Italy should show the most affection and perform the most serious joint program of going through fire and water together. However, the German leader, at the moment when the blood debts of Britain and France are strained and the artillery fire in Poland is continuous, leisurely thanked Italy, saying that it would not bother with aid. The Italian government also declared internationally that Italy would not enter the whirlpool and would not initiate military action. Is this Germany despising Italy, or Italy betraying Germany? Is it that the two countries are on the verge of breaking up, and the military alliance is just a formality? Not so. There is a special purpose. (1) It implies to Britain and France that they do not have to fulfill their obligation to aid Poland. (2) It stabilizes the pro-Polish countries such as Turkey and Romania. (3) It shows that Germany's ambition lies in Danzig and the Polish Corridor and has no other ambitions. (4) It proves that the German-Italian axis does not want to destroy all-European peace. (5) It protects national strength, which is also to preserve the strength of the axis. (6) It makes European countries feel that a great disaster is imminent, so they all hope to reduce the scope of the disaster and avoid it. (7) It makes it nearly impossible for the anti-axis countries to deploy their lines militarily due to Italy's non-mobilization. (8) It allows Germany to have ample space behind it. Who likes war? The authorities of Germany and Italy have seen through everything and planned it thoroughly. After Ribbentrop and Ciano talked intimately, they designed this brilliant situation! Every major move by Germany shows people its unpredictable nature. It has no secrets from Italy. For example, when the Soviet Union and Germany concluded a treaty, Britain, France, and Japan were all in the dark, but Germany only told Italy. It is also well known to Italy that Germany has no intention of accepting British mediation and negotiating with Poland and has a determination to use force. However, on the eve of Germany's attack, Italy told France that it was willing to mediate, making France laugh and cry and unable to refuse. This is another aspect of the Axis' actions, like filing a case in advance before litigation. Its brilliance lies in the future. While the matter is not worth teaching, if it can shorten the time and space of European turmoil and suffering, then it is not necessary to criticize it harshly.

### Germany's Actions Regarding the Polish Situation Should Not Be Considered a Formal War: Statement from Authoritative Figures in Berlin; Polish Troops Bravely Resist Aggression; Fighting Still Limited to Border Areas

Berlin: Authoritative figures here solemnly stated today that the military actions taken by German forces yesterday in response to Polish military attacks should not currently be considered a formal war, but rather actions triggered by Polish attacks. (2nd, Huitong Telegraph)

Warsaw: According to reliable sources here, the current fighting between German and Polish forces is still limited to the border areas, with no major changes. Semi-official sources state that German forces in the Malawa area have been repelled by Polish forces. Simultaneously, powerful German forces in the Deutz-Kalk area have also been intercepted by Polish forces and have made no progress. However, Polish forces attacking Danzig have made significant progress. Furthermore, a large Polish force is currently launching a determined offensive towards Silesia, southeast of East Prussia. There has been no progress in the German offensive against the Polish Corridor. Gdynia Harbor was bombed by the German Navy throughout the day yesterday, and casualties are expected to be very heavy. At 4:40 PM yesterday, German bombers came here for the seventh air raid. The Polish side responded with intense anti-aircraft fire, and Polish fighter planes also took to the air to engage, causing the German planes to leave without dropping their bombs. (2nd, Associated Press)

London: Polish sources in London recently stated that German forces have not broken through the Polish defense line at any point. A spokesperson stated that the Polish front line remains at the border and has not changed. (2nd, Reuters)

Warsaw: Fierce fighting is currently taking place within the Polish Upper Silesia province. Tank vehicles from both German and Polish armies are participating. One German armored train has been destroyed by Polish artillery, and one German aircraft has also been shot down. All the crew members have been captured. Many German soldiers have been captured in various locations along the front line. In the Danzig area, German forces attacked the Polish garrison in Westerplatte but were heavily damaged and retreated. In addition, many Polish towns and cities have been damaged as a result of German aircraft bombing. Gdynia harbor has been bombed. In total, German aircraft losses today amounted to sixteen, while the Polish side lost only two. (1st, Havas)

Warsaw: Officials here announced that German forces attacking Murawa on the road from East Prussia to Warsaw and Gdynia, and attacking the famous scenic spot of Zakopane from Slovakia, have all been defeated by Polish forces. German forces have begun large-scale attacks on various towns in the Polish Corridor. Polish forces captured a German armored train near Danzig and shot down seven German aircraft at Krakow and Gdynia. German bombers attempted to fly to Warsaw but were driven back. A refugee train near Sierpc was bombed, causing heavy casualties. Enemy air raids at the beginning of the war were unsuccessful. (2nd, Reuters)

The Hague: According to a Warsaw telegram received by the Polish Telegraph Agency, German aircraft have conducted 94 air raids on Polish towns and cities by this morning, resulting in 130 deaths, of which only 12 were soldiers, and the rest were mostly women and children. Many people were seriously injured. A hospital in Wieluń was hit by a bomb, causing a large fire. (2nd, Reuters)

Bombing

London: Residents of Warsaw witnessed a heart-stopping air battle over the city center again yesterday afternoon. Anti-aircraft fire was intense, and all kinds of air defense measures were used. According to Polish authorities, two German bombers were shot down in the battle. A Jewish refugee children's hospital was hit by a bomb and destroyed. (2nd, Reuters)

London: Polish sources here recently announced that the news of German aircraft flying to Warsaw twice to bomb has been confirmed. The first time was at dawn today. When the German planes attacked for the second time, the Polish government dispatched many fighter planes to intercept them. They encountered German bombers 20 kilometers from Warsaw, and an air battle immediately broke out. Many German aircraft were shot down, and the German aircraft then turned back, failing to reach Warsaw. In addition, the German army's attempts to break through the Polish army's defense line were all frustrated. The Polish position is actually at the border and remains unmoved. (1st, Havas)

Warsaw: Since the German army began its offensive along the entire Polish border yesterday, there has been no major progress so far. What is noteworthy is that German aircraft are bombing undefended cities, causing many casualties among innocent civilians. The Polish Army General Staff recently issued its first war report, stating, "Germany invaded our country without a formal declaration of war yesterday morning. German aircraft also bombed 15 of our cities and one railway tunnel. A train in Grotno, which was evacuating civilians, was also bombed, causing many casualties. All the churches in the city of Bydgoszcz were destroyed by bombing." (2nd, Havas)

London: According to the Polish Embassy here this morning, Polish cities were suddenly bombed yesterday, completely unexpectedly. Residents were unaware that the war had already broken out. According to news received from London, the German army's attack on the Polish army base in Westerplatte, Danzig, was repelled by the Polish army. According to an official from the Polish Embassy, the Polish army's heavy artillery positions put Danzig within their range, with some of them mounted on mountains outside Gdynia. The Polish government is currently broadcasting mobilization orders and evacuation orders via radio. (2nd, Reuters)

German War Report

Berlin: The first war report was issued here, stating that military operations in Silesia, Pomerania, and East Prussia have achieved the expected victories. German forces have advanced to the highlands of Katowice in the Upper Silesia region of Poland, and German forces starting from East Prussia are currently fighting within Polish territory. The German Air Force has bombed several Polish airfields and has gained air superiority. German warships also occupy some positions in the port of Danzig, and the port of Gdynia has also been bombed by German aircraft. (2nd, Reuters)

Berlin: The German Air Force has destroyed the Polish Kantowitz airfield. According to an army announcement, the National Socialist stormtroopers have broken through the southern Polish defense line and advanced from Neumarkt to Sega. Conflicts have also occurred on the front line of the Polish Corridor. German forces stationed in East Prussia have been fighting in Polish territory. After establishing a strong base in Marienswerder, the German army set off for Kantowitz. In addition to the Kantowitz airfield, more than 20 Polish bases have been destroyed by the German army. The military announcement denied bombing civilians and undefended cities. The announcement also declared that the German army, navy, and air force are advancing rapidly together and are approaching Kantowitz, Gleiwitz, and other industrial centers. The German ship "Schleswig-Holstein" in the Bay of Danzig has occupied the Polish armory. Westerplatte is under fire, and Gdynia has been bombed. The first official news broadcast stated, "The German army has been ordered to stop 'Polish atrocities.' The German army began its counterattack after receiving the order." The German news agency reported that Polish forces opened fire at the Berlin train station, but there was no damage. (2nd, Reuters)

Berlin: The High Command of the German Armed Forces announced at noon today, "German troops continued to advance on all fronts yesterday afternoon and continued to progress this morning, overcoming the Jablonka Pass. The Air Force dispatched planes to bomb Polish airfields, destroying many enemy aircraft." (2nd, Huitong Telegraph)

### Peace Movement Resurges; Italian Foreign Minister Meets with Envoys from Various Countries; France Expresses Acceptance of Italian Mediation; Britain Welcomes Italy's Decision Not to Participate in the War

Rome: Foreign Minister Ciano recently met separately with envoys from various countries, including British Ambassador Sir Percy Loraine, French Ambassador François Poncet, American Ambassador William Phillips, Polish Ambassador Władysław Grzybowski, and German Ambassador Hans Georg von Mackensen. (2nd, Havas)

Paris: Officials recently announced that the Italian government had yesterday proposed to the French and other governments a way to resolve the current European dispute. After consideration, the French government has submitted a positive response to Italy. (1st, Havas)

Paris: The French government announced last night that it has accepted Italy's proposal in principle to convene a five-power conference to resolve the German-Polish problem. France's future actions will depend on the outcome of the Anglo-French demand that German troops withdraw from Polish territory. (2nd, Associated Press)

London: The Times' Rome correspondent recently reported that since German leader Adolf Hitler has telegraphed Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, asking him not to provide military assistance, the Italian cabinet has also decided to avoid getting involved in the war vortex. There is much commentary here, and many believe that Italy's move is almost a declaration that regardless of whether Britain and France take hostile action against Germany, Italy should maintain neutrality. Or perhaps the Italian cabinet made this decision after understanding the positions of Britain and France, so that the country will not collude with Germany as long as it is not attacked by the democratic countries (diplomatic circles here believe that the democratic countries will never attack Italy), but some also believe that Italy has not completely abandoned its axis policy. The decision taken is intended to leave room for maneuver. However, the general public believes that Italy's current attention is focused on Albania and Abyssinia, completing military preparations as soon as possible, and then observing the situation. In short, whatever the explanation for the decision taken by the Italian cabinet yesterday, it is deeply welcomed by the general public here. (2nd, Havas)

### President Roosevelt Scheduled to Deliver a Speech Today; America Will Not Be Drawn into the War Vortex; Outcome of European Situation Will Be Clear in a Few Days

Washington: President Roosevelt told reporters this morning, "I not only sincerely hope that the United States can avoid being drawn into the European war vortex, but I also believe that we can stay out of it. The government will also make every effort to avoid being drawn into the vortex." The President also announced the resignation of Wilson, the US Ambassador to Germany. Some political circles see this as an indication that the United States intends to sever diplomatic relations with Germany. Secretary of State Hull was also present when the President met with journalists. One person's attitude was serious. The President pointed out that the current situation is the most serious in history. The President convened Army Secretary Woodring, Acting Navy Secretary Edison, Army Chief of Staff Johnson, and Army Chief of Staff Stark last night, and senior officials of the Treasury Department also met until dawn before dispersing. (2nd, Associated Press)

Washington: President Roosevelt recently told the press that the evolution of the European situation will be clear in the next few days, and the US position at that time should also be determined. He hopes that public opinion will use common sense, remain calm, and help him cope with the current situation. When publishing news, newspapers must strive to be accurate and based on what has been confirmed by the White House, the State Department, or various departments, so that public opinion will not be misled or cause unnecessary panic. In short, at a time when civilization is under threat, we need cooperation from all walks of life to enlighten public opinion. As far as American action is concerned, I intend to wait for the European situation to be completely clarified before convening a special session of Congress and amending the current Neutrality Act to ensure complete security. In short, for the sake of American interests at this moment, it is best to remain silent and watch the situation. I hope that the newspapers will understand this meaning, and be cautious when publishing. A reporter asked whether the United States could avoid being drawn into the war vortex. The President replied that he not only hoped so, but also believed that it would not be difficult. The government will devote all its efforts to this in the future. The President also said that Wilson, the US Ambassador to Germany, has not returned to his post since returning to the country this spring and has recently submitted his resignation. The government has decided to approve it and transfer him to an important position in the State Department. As for the vacancy of the Ambassador to Germany, it has not yet been decided whether to replace him. It is also rumored that Secretary of State Hull has ordered all domestic ships to return to domestic ports. This statement is not accurate, which shows that there are many rumors outside, and newspapers should be cautious when publishing them. In addition, when the German President mentioned the hostile actions between Germany and Poland, he used the word "invasion" of Poland by the German army. All observers paid close attention to this point. (1st, Havas)

Washington: Political circles here now believe that the opportunity to amend the current Neutrality Act as soon as possible to help the democratic countries fight has greatly increased. They are currently discussing electing President Roosevelt for a third consecutive term to prevent the United States from being drawn into the war. It is too early to say that the neutral sentiment has changed, but clear movements have indeed shown signs. All parties now clearly express sympathy for the democratic countries, so sooner or later it will lead to political action. The determination not to send American troops to the European war has never been as strong as it is today, but the public feels that it can provide great assistance to the democratic countries within the scope of the Neutrality Act. The Roosevelt government is determined to ask Congress to approve this move and is determined to succeed. (2nd, Reuters)

Washington: It is widely rumored here that if the European war breaks out, President Roosevelt will request a special session of Congress to allocate 10 billion US dollars for military preparations. Government officials refuse to discuss whether this is possible. (2nd, Associated Press)

Washington: President Roosevelt's secretary, Early, recently announced that the President did not sleep all night last night due to the tense European situation. Tonight, he ordered the State Department personnel that if a major incident occurs, they should get up and work even late at night, and then return to the White House to rest. In addition, President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver a radio speech at 9 pm on the 3rd of this month, which will be broadcast to European countries by the three major American radio stations. This speech will contain instructive content and explain the position taken by the American government. (1st, Havas)

### America Calls for No Bombing of Civilians; Five Countries Respond with Approval

Washington: Secretary of State Hull announced that Britain and France have agreed to President Roosevelt's call not to bomb civilians. The British reply stated that bombing is limited to military targets, which is Britain's fixed policy, but requires the enemy to also carefully comply. (2nd, Reuters)

Washington: Polish Ambassador Potocki submitted a reply to Secretary of State Hull this evening, which stated, "The Polish government received President Roosevelt's telegram. His benevolent words are beneficial and deeply appreciated. The principles on which this move is based are deeply supported by our government. Our highest military authorities have already ordered the Air Force to act accordingly based on these principles. Unfortunately, our territory has been invaded by German troops without cause since this morning, and the Air Force of that country has repeatedly bombed us. In this way, the order issued by our highest military authorities based on humanitarian considerations must be conditional on the other party also being able to effectively comply." (1st, Havas)

Washington: After President Roosevelt telegraphed the governments of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, urging them not to use aircraft to bomb undefended cities, British Ambassador Lord Lothian delivered a reply from his government to the President, which stated, "We greatly admire your Excellency's appeal, advocating that aircraft not be used to bomb innocent civilians in undefended cities. The government has already established a policy that it will avoid using this method of warfare when forced to be drawn into the war in the future, but on the condition that the enemy can also adhere to the same restrictions." In addition, Italian Ambassador Suvich orally submitted a response to President Roosevelt, saying that the Italian Cabinet meeting had decided in the afternoon to stay out of the war. Therefore, the Italian government believes that President Roosevelt's appeal is not relevant to that country. According to the President's issuance of this telegram, the governments of Poland and Britain and France have replied in favor, and the Italian reply has been as mentioned above. Only the German government has not yet submitted an answer. (1st, Havas)

Berlin: US President Roosevelt appealed to all countries that may participate in the war, requesting them to publicly declare that they would never use the Air Force to bomb the people and undefended cities. Hitler has replied by telegram, which has been delivered by the US Chargé d'affaires, and the full text is as follows: Your Excellency's advocacy of respecting humanitarianism and not bombing non-military objects coincides with my views. Therefore, I unconditionally express my support, requesting all countries to jointly and publicly declare that, in addition to what I have repeatedly stated in my speech to Congress, I have today ordered the Air Force to limit itself to military objectives, but on the condition that the other party also complies with the same principles.

### Molotov's Diplomatic Report on the Process of the German-Soviet Pact

(Continued from yesterday) I will now continue to discuss the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. The initial decision to conclude this pact between the Soviet Union and Germany was made after the Anglo-French-Soviet military negotiations reached a stalemate due to the aforementioned insurmountable disputes. We, because the negotiation process showed that the conclusion of a mutual assistance pact was hopeless, had to explore other possible ways to safeguard peace and eliminate the crisis of German-Soviet war. If the British and French governments are unwilling to consider this, they are free to do so. Our responsibility is to consider the interests of the Soviet people and the Soviet Socialist Federal Republic (sustained applause), allowing it to be because we explore the interests of the Soviet Union, which are in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples of all countries (applause). "This is still one aspect of the issue. In addition, if the Soviet Union and Germany want to establish a non-aggression pact, Germany must adopt an attitude of good neighborliness with the Soviet Union in its foreign policy. After the establishment of this second condition, that is, after we know that the German government is indeed willing to change its foreign policy, thereby improving relations with the Soviet Union, the foundation for the establishment of a non-aggression pact between the two countries will be laid. "Everyone knows that for six years, since the National Socialist Party took power, German-Soviet political relations have been in a state of tension. Everyone also knows that although the two countries have different positions and political systems, the Soviet government will still strive to maintain normal commercial and political relations with Germany. All of you are aware of the various independent events that have occurred in these types of relations in recent years, which do not need to be detailed again now. What I must point out is the explanation of our foreign policy in the 18th Congress of our Party a few months ago.

When Stalin mentioned the tasks of our foreign policy, he explained our country's attitude towards all countries as follows: First, continue the policy of peace and strengthen business relations with all countries; second, be cautious at all times and prevent our country from being introduced into conflicts by warmongers who are good at exploiting others' troubles." (Excitement) In this way, Stalin had already declared that the Soviet Union advocated strengthening business relations with all countries. At the same time, Stalin warned us not to be exploited by warmongers who were trying to cause conflicts between our country and other countries for their own interests. Stalin also exposed the truth about the "plans of the German occupation of Soviet Ukraine" in the newspapers of Britain, France, and the United States, saying, "The purpose of this suspicious clamor seems to be to provoke the Soviet Union against Germany, poisoning the air and unreasonably provoking Germany." Here, Stalin thoroughly exposed the conspiracy of Western European politicians who were trying to provoke German-Soviet conflict. But we must admit that even in our country, there are short-sighted people who are caught up in overly simple anti-fascist propaganda and forget this provocation by the enemy. Stalin, taking this into account, mentioned the possibility of establishing good neighborly relations between Germany and the Soviet Union at that time.

Now we know that Germany has, on the whole, correctly understood Stalin's aforementioned declaration, thereby drawing practical conclusions (laughter). The conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact shows that Stalin's historical foresight has been fully confirmed. In the spring of this year, the German government suggested to our country that it reopen negotiations on commercial credit. Soon these negotiations were reopened. After the two sides made concessions to each other, the two countries reached an agreement and signed it on August 19. The signing of this agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union was not a preliminary decision. But this agreement is not only different from the agreement of 1935, but it is also more favorable compared with all past agreements, even any economic agreements concluded between our country and Britain, France, or any country. The advantage is that the credit period is as long as seven years and that it gives our country the opportunity to order a large amount of necessary equipment. The Soviet side is also willing to sell a certain amount of surplus raw materials to Germany for its industry. This is also in line with our country's interests. How can we reject such a favorable economic agreement? Is it to curry favor with those who do not want the Soviet Union to establish favorable economic agreements with other countries? Moreover, this agreement is not only suitable for our country's economic and national defense interests, but also in line with Stalin's declaration on the need to "strengthen business relations with all countries," which was passed by the 18th Congress of our Party. When the German government expressed its willingness to improve political relations, the Soviet government had no reason to refuse. Therefore, the issue of establishing a non-aggression pact arose. The current uproar from all sides is enough to prove that they do not understand the simple rationale for the improvement of German-Soviet political relations that is now beginning. For example, some people ask in a confused manner, how can the Soviet Union agree to improve political relations with a fascist-type country? But they forget that this is not our issue of the internal political system of other countries, but the issue of diplomatic relations between the two countries. They forget that our advocacy is non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and at the same time, we do not allow other countries to interfere in our internal affairs (to be continued)

### The Soviet Union Replaces its Ambassador to Germany

Moscow: The Soviet government has recently appointed Shkvartsev as the Ambassador to Germany. It is said that Shkvartsev will go to Berlin soon to take office. The former Ambassador to Germany, Merekalov, has been transferred back for other assignments. (2nd, Huitong Telegraph)

Washington: A very reliable government official told the Associated Press reporter, based on confidential information from London and Paris, that there is a one in a million chance that Britain and France will declare war on Germany today. If war is formally declared, President Roosevelt will definitely convene a special session of Congress, the most likely date being Sunday. (2nd, Associated Press)

### British Government Announces Details of Negotiations with Germany

London - A detailed account of Britain's efforts to avert the crisis at the end of August is provided in the White Paper published here today. It contains the recent exchange of documents between London and Berlin. In its reply to Germany on August 28, Britain suggested direct discussions between Poland and Germany, with Poland's permission. Germany was notified that Poland was prepared to enter into direct discussions with Germany immediately. Germany was expected to deliver a written response the following day (August 29) to the British Ambassador in Germany, Henderson. The wording of the response, besides making far-fetched claims about the various facts that led to this crisis, demanded that Poland send a plenipotentiary to Berlin by August 30. The second British response was delivered to the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at midnight on August 30. The German side then issued a lengthy document in reply, which was apparently the sixteen-point plan published by Germany. When British Ambassador Henderson requested the original text of this proposal from the German Foreign Minister, he was told that because the Polish envoy had failed to arrive in Berlin by midnight, it was now too late. After hearing about these developments, Poland informed Britain on the afternoon of August 30 that it would authorize its ambassador in Berlin, Lipski, to announce that Poland accepted Britain's proposal for negotiations. The German Foreign Minister did not receive the Polish ambassador until the evening of August 31. After the meeting, the German side broadcast its proposal over the radio. The Polish ambassador wanted to establish contact with Warsaw immediately, but all traffic between Poland and Germany had been blocked by Germany, so he was unable to do so. The British publication of the correspondence begins with a letter from British Prime Minister Chamberlain to Hitler on August 26, on behalf of the British government. The letter first outlines the precautionary measures Britain had begun to take and states that, in the British government's view, because of repeated rumors of German military action, and because some in Berlin believed that the announcement of the German-Soviet pact might indicate that Britain's intervention on behalf of Poland was no longer possible, it was necessary to take precautionary steps. Nothing could be more wrong. Whatever the nature of the German-Soviet pact, it could not change Britain's obligations to Poland, which the British government had repeatedly and clearly stated its determination to fulfill. The Prime Minister solemnly declared that the British government did not want others to misunderstand its attitude, and he cited his remarks in the House of Commons on August 24, stating that in the event of an incident, Britain was determined to immediately use all its forces to intervene. The Prime Minister concluded by saying, "I have made a very clear statement of the position in which Britain stands. I firmly believe that if war were to break out between Britain and Germany, it would be a great disaster for the world. I dare say that the peoples of both countries do not wish it to be so. I believe that the problem between Poland and Germany, if both sides can restore trust and discuss openly and honestly with each other, there is no reason why it cannot be resolved peacefully. We are ready at any time to create an environment so that these negotiations can proceed, and at the same time, we can discuss broader issues affecting future international relations, including all matters relating to Britain and Germany."

Hitler replied to Britain on August 23, stating that Germany had certain real interests that it could not abandon, but that these interests did not exceed the limits prescribed by Germany's previous history and were based on significant economic needs. Regarding the issue of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, Hitler blamed Britain's guarantee to Poland for the acts of terror perpetrated by Poland against 1.5 million Germans. Hitler concluded by saying that the countries that must bear the responsibility for the Treaty of Versailles must change their spirit, and then relations between Britain and Germany could improve.

When Hitler met with British Ambassador Henderson on August 25, he also spoke about the speeches made by British Foreign Secretary Halifax and British Prime Minister Chamberlain in Parliament on August 24. He said that the British claim that Germany intended to conquer the world was ridiculous. Hitler also said that he was prepared and determined to contact the British side again with greater and broader conditions after the German-Polish issue was resolved.

Britain replied to Hitler's letters and conversations of August 23 and 25 on August 28, pointing out that the suggestions made by Hitler regarding the relationship between Britain and Germany were of the most common form, but that if the Polish-German issue could be resolved peacefully, the British government was prepared to accept and discuss it. The next step should be direct negotiations between Germany and Poland, and that Britain had now obtained a firm guarantee from Poland, expressing that it was prepared to engage in discussions with Germany based on protecting Poland's major interests and achieving a solution through international guarantees. A fair resolution of the Polish-German issue could open the path to world peace.

Hitler handed the reply to Ambassador Henderson on August 29, stating the various military actions of Poland, and the many acts of aggression by Poland against the Free City of Danzig, and stating that the Germans within Poland were being subjected to Polish abuse. Germany had tolerated this for months, and now had no choice but to take necessary measures to protect Germany's interests. Germany no longer believed that the dispute between Germany and Poland could be resolved through direct negotiations, but since Britain had made this proposal, Germany was willing to give it a try.

Among the correspondence released by the British side were several telegrams from the British government to Ambassador Henderson in Germany, stating that while Britain attached importance to the urgency of the current situation, it considered Germany's demand that a Polish envoy must arrive in Berlin by midnight to be unreasonable. In the final telegram, Britain suggested that Germany should follow diplomatic custom, and after the proposal was ready, invite the Polish ambassador to come and deliver it to Warsaw.

The British side then delivered a reply to Hitler's note of August 29 to the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at midnight on August 30, stating that Britain would give full consideration to the conditions proposed by Germany for the resolution of the Polish issue, and believed that it was necessary to begin this discussion quickly, and further advocated a temporary maintenance of the status quo for Danzig.

The final piece of correspondence released was a note from the German government to the British ambassador, stating that the Polish plenipotentiary had not yet arrived, causing Germany to wait for two days, and listing the German sixteen-point plan. (Reuters telegram from the 2nd)

(Haitong telegram from the 2nd)

Geneva - Since France guaranteed to respect Swiss neutrality, people here believe that all rumors about Switzerland being threatened by war have lost their effect. The Swiss Federal Council has repeatedly stated in recent days that if anyone disrespects Switzerland's neutrality, Switzerland will respond with force. After the general mobilization order issued yesterday is fully implemented, Switzerland will have a standing army of 450,000 men to defend its borders. Yesterday, thousands of soldiers said goodbye to their parents, wives, or lovers and left with high spirits. It is expected that all borders will be closed by late at night. As of last night, the government had not yet notified the people to prepare for evacuation. (Haitong telegram from the 2nd)

Warsaw - General Smigly-Rydz, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, recently issued a proclamation to the army, saying, "Soldiers of the Polish nation, our country's long-standing enemy invaded and attacked the borders of the Polish Republic on September 1. The time has come for us to fulfill our responsibilities. All our soldiers should fight for the survival and future of Poland. Every step the enemy takes must be paid for with a large amount of blood. What our country advocates is just and righteous, and it is also what God advocates. All soldiers should trust in it, and fulfill their duties with the greatest sacrifice, and preserve their honor. No matter how long the war lasts, our country and its allies will surely win the final victory. The Polish Republic has been attacked by Germany, and this is a fact that is of the utmost importance, and the number of figures cannot diminish it. Germany has already invaded our territory, and has also sent planes from afar to bomb at will, which should be recognized by everyone. Our country did not know anything about the sixteen proposals made by Germany, until the German radio station broadcast the full text on the evening of August 31. This kind of demand is forcing our country to abandon its life, and it is definitely not something our country can accept. Germany also knows this, and that is why it immediately resorts to coercion. As for the bombing of our country's cities by German planes, the intention is to threaten the civilians, but it has no effect. The people will never panic, and they will come out of the shelters during the bombing to watch the aerial combat, and applaud to encourage our country's pilots to bravely shoot down the invading country's planes. The people's morale is extremely high, and this can be seen from this. (Havas telegram from the 2nd)

The stock market will open on schedule on Monday. Except for foreign exchange and Liverpool wheat, all other markets will be closed today. (Reuters telegram from the 2nd)

Paris - The French government's general mobilization order was posted at 6 pm last night, stipulating that midnight yesterday was the time for 6 million people to continue enlisting. The mobilization order brought the total number of French armed forces to 8 million. (Associated Press telegram from the 2nd)

Paris - Although the situation is extremely serious after the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Poland, the scene in Paris has not changed in reality, which makes people more excited about the greatness of Paris. However, there are more people wearing uniforms on the streets than usual, and the guard teams in front of various departments and agencies have presented a wartime scene. More generally speaking, the citizens are as calm as ever, and passers-by mostly stand on the street to watch the mobilization bulletin. Various transportation engineers have been reduced, so citizens are competing to hire business cars to replace them. The stations are very crowded, but because the railway authorities handle it properly, the order is in good order, and passengers do not have the pain of waiting for a long time and not being able to get on the bus. Everything in daily life is as usual. The citizens not only have no anxiety or disappointment, but also have a firm attitude and are extremely calm. What is most noteworthy is the long kiss when the conscripts leave to bid farewell to their wives, children or lovers at the station. (Havas telegram from the 1st)

### Chinese Army Sweeps Away Japanese Troops Around Changzhi, Recovers North Bao Dian Town in Changzi, Over 100 Japanese Soldiers Killed

Luoyang - The battle around Changzhi is becoming increasingly fierce. After days of fierce attacks by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops are extremely panicked. In addition to thoroughly sweeping away the scattered units of the Japanese army around Changzhi, the Chinese army has also changed its strategy, concentrating its forces to launch fierce attacks on the Kou Kou area. Changzi and Changzhi were originally in a mutually supportive position. The Japanese army has recently been actively building roads to seek contact and to relieve the siege of Changzhi. The six to seven hundred Japanese troops in Nanhetou Village, south of Changzi, along with three or four cannons, advanced on the Chinese army on the 29th, but were bravely repelled by the Chinese army, and took the opportunity to attack the Japanese army in victory. On that day, Shibei Bo (west of Changzi) was recovered. On the 30th, it had advanced to the Changzhang Village · Peijiazhuang area and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army. In addition, the Chinese army × unit attacked the Kou army in Baodian (north of Changzi) again on the 29th. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted, but after a fierce charge and a half-day battle by the Chinese army, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. By the evening, the Japanese army was defeated and Baodian Town was recovered. The remnants fled eastward. Baodian Town is an important stronghold north of Changzi, connecting the traffic between Changzi and Tunliu. Now that it has been captured by the Chinese army, Changzi has lost its barrier, and it should be recovered in the short term. And Changzhi, the isolated city, is in an increasingly difficult situation, and the Chinese army will have new progress in the coming days. (Telegram from the 1st)

### Japanese Troops in Guangzhou Heavily Guarded

Guangzhou - Japanese soldiers with loaded rifles and bayonets inspected all pedestrians on Sha Ji Road yesterday, preventing entry and exit from the side roads. This restriction lasted from 1 pm to 3 pm. The curfew implemented in the early morning was not lifted until 7:15 pm. It is said that the Japanese army took this action because many bandits have recently been found on Sunan Island (translation) across the river from this city. (Reuters telegram from the 2nd)

### Ling County, Puppet Troops Mutiny

Xi'an - Military news, the puppet security team in Ling County, northern Shandong, with over 100 men and guns each, recently mutinied because they were unwilling to be oppressed by the Japanese army. After repeated negotiations and support, on the night of the 16th, the Chinese army sent a team to monitor the stronghold and cut off traffic. At the same time, they led the team into the city. The puppet troops, led by Zhang Wenzeng, mutinied en masse and captured the puppet regiment commander Fan Shujian, the puppet finance section chief Rong Jianting, the puppet team leaders Chen Yushan, Du Huaide, Wang Xixian, the puppet quartermaster Yao Yuxiu, the puppet patrol officer Men Ziqing, the puppet police chief Su Xiufeng, and a total of 15 soldiers. Only the puppet county magistrate escaped alone. That night, more than a dozen puppet troops stationed in Sunlujia (5 li east of Ling County) mutinied, with more than 30 guns.

### Remains of Japanese Plane Found at Tongxingchang

Chongqing - It has been learned that the tail of a Japanese plane was found in Tongxingchang, north of Ciqikou. The local Baojia head has reported it to the superiors, and people have been sent to transport it to Chongqing. According to the air battle on the 28th of last month, the Chinese Air Force chased a Japanese plane over the northwestern suburbs of Chongqing, and one plane was shot down, but it could not be found for a while. The location where the plane tail was found is consistent with the location of the air battle that day, so it is judged that the plane tail may be part of the wreckage of the Japanese plane shot down by the Chinese army that day. (Telegram from the 2nd)

### Even if a Major War Breaks Out in Europe, the Source of Chinese Military Fire Will Never Be Exhausted, Chongqing Officials Are Mostly Optimistic

Chongqing - The intellectuals and officials here have a lot of speculation about the European war, and they are willing to pay attention to its impact on the Far East. However, the general view of officials is mostly optimistic, because China has accumulated a large amount of foreign military fire and military supplies so far, which is enough for a very long period of application. At the same time, foreign military fire and various military supplies are still coming in steadily. The Chinese side believes that even if a major war breaks out, German military fire can still come to China via the Northwest Railway, because China produces tungsten, and Germany needs tungsten to manufacture military fire, so it cannot but exchange military fire for China's tungsten sand. In the past, Germany and Japan had a anti-communist public, but in order to obtain China's tungsten sand and other raw materials, they still had to conclude a barter agreement with China. Now, the anti-communist public has become waste paper. In order to obtain the tungsten sand necessary for manufacturing military fire, Germany must continue to export military fire to China. However, the supply of military fire and military supplies from European countries to Japan will stop from now on, because all countries must use it for their own purposes. As for the diplomatic aspect, China's position is stronger than Japan's. On the eve of the outbreak of the European war, Japan lost all its friendly countries, but China not only maintained its old friendly countries, but also gained new friendly countries. For example, in the past ten days, the relationship between China and Germany has greatly increased, which can greatly help each other. According to Chinese dignitaries, it is expected that Japan will soon seek peace with China, and at this time China will put forward 21 conditions to Japan. However, as far as the general public is concerned, the Chinese are indeed sympathetic to Poland. (Associated Press telegram from the 2nd)

### Chongqing People Pay Attention to European War News

Chongqing - The news of the German-Polish war was shocking. Chinese and foreign residents flocked to radio receivers to listen to the latest broadcasts from London, Berlin, and other places. European news is now the focus of attention for everyone, even causing the Sino-Japanese War to quietly take a decisive position. Last night, all Chinese newspapers printed extra editions, announcing European war news. The political circles did not want to make comments on this incident. A Reuters reporter sought opinions from all parties. Most Chinese expressed sympathy for Britain and Poland. Although all Chinese circles criticized Hitler's policy of aggression, they expressed great affection for the people of the General State. It is said that the National Government will announce a public policy on the European War in the coming days. Reuters has learned that if the European War officially breaks out, the National Government seems to announce its support for Britain. (Reuters telegram from the 2nd)

### Mongolian Border War is Fierce, Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces Issue Battle Report: Japanese "Manchukuo" Troops Completely Eliminated in Mongolian Territory

Moscow - The command of the Mongolian People's Republic's Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces recently issued the following communique: From August 5 to 17, only small teams of sentries from the Soviet-Mongolian forces and the Japanese "Manchukuo" forces encountered each other in the area east of the Khalkhin Gol. The Japanese air force repeatedly attempted to cross into Mongolian territory, but were repelled by the Soviet-Mongolian air force. 31 Japanese planes were shot down, while the Soviet-Mongolian side lost only 7. On August 17, after gathering a large number of reinforcements, the Japanese "Manchukuo" army began to advance towards the Soviet-Mongolian army's front line on the east bank of the Khalkhin Gol, 6 kilometers from the river, attempting to occupy several important heights. These attacks were repelled by the Soviet-Mongolian army until the 19th. The Japanese "Manchukuo" army was finally forced to retreat to its original line and adopt a defensive posture. From August 20, the Soviet-Mongolian army, with air force cover, launched a major offensive on the entire front line on the east bank of the Khalkhin Gol. As a result, from August 21 to 28, the Japanese "Manchukuo" army was completely surrounded on both wings. After inflicting great losses on them in manpower and equipment, they began to eliminate them. Although small teams of remnants of the Japanese "Manchukuo" army attempted to counterattack, they were all crushed by the Soviet-Mongolian army. By the night of August 28 and 29, these remaining Japanese "Manchukuo" troops entrenched in the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic had been completely eliminated. The Soviet-Mongolian army thus advanced completely to the national border and established a strong front line. As a result of this major elimination, the Japanese "Manchukuo" army suffered extremely heavy losses. 294 soldiers of the 14th National Infantry of the "Manchukuo" First Mixed Brigade automatically surrendered with their weapons, led by their officers. The spoils captured by the Soviet-Mongolian army included 5 155mm caliber guns, 7 150mm guns, 12 105mm guns, 3 122mm guns, 50 75mm guns, 67 37mm guns, a total of 144 guns, 67 heavy machine guns, 98 light machine guns, 26 mortars, 9,000 rifles, 12,000 rounds of various calibers, 8 tanks, 8 armored vehicles, 14 tractors, 68 trucks, and 10 passenger cars. The Japanese air force tried to help the surrounded troops with a desperate fight, but the results were extremely tragic. Between August 20 and 27, a total of 164 planes were shot down by the Soviet-Mongolian air force, including 123 fighters, 36 bombers, and 5 multi-seat command planes. At the same time, the Soviet-Mongolian air force lost only 16 planes. On August 28, another 11 Japanese planes were shot down, with no Soviet-Mongolian losses.

Nuomonhan - The Japanese troops are now preparing to launch a major offensive against the Soviet army. There were continuous fierce battles between the Japanese and Soviet armies today. This is only six miles away from the Japanese front line. If you look far with binoculars, you can see the Japanese planes flying in the anti-aircraft fire line. In addition, the Japanese artillery near here sometimes bombards the Soviet positions. When the reporter came here from Hailar, he saw hundreds of Japanese military trucks on the way, rushing forward, full of Japanese soldiers and anti-aircraft guns, heavy artillery, kerosene, and other military supplies. Yesterday, Soviet planes were exceptionally active, so the Japanese trucks had to stop on the way and wait for the arrival of dusk. At that time, it was no more than 50 miles away from the Japanese front line. Last night, the moon was bright and the wind was clear, which was suitable for aircraft to conduct night reconnaissance, so the Japanese trucks accelerated forward between midnight yesterday. (Soviet planes were still quite active at midnight.) Now the reporter is living in a Japanese military tent, and there are four wounded soldiers outside the tent being treated by doctors. Yesterday, the reporter saw 30 trucks, full of lightly wounded Japanese soldiers, rushing towards Hailar. Most of the trucks used by the Japanese army are American products.

### Tianjin's Four Chinese Nationals Still Not Extradited

Tianjin: According to news received here today, Japanese and puppet officials today visited the British consulate to discuss the extradition of the four Chinese nationals. The British consul stated that he was acting under instructions from the British government and that the four Chinese nationals could not be extradited at this time. It is reported that British Consul Jameson had previously informed the Japanese and puppet authorities that he had received the four Chinese nationals, but Judge Jones of the British Supreme Court in Shanghai, in response to requests from various circles for habeas corpus, had agreed to conduct a second inquiry into the reasons for the detention of the four Chinese nationals and had scheduled a hearing for November. He has now telegraphed the British authorities in Tianjin to inquire about the reasons. However, according to a Japanese military spokesman, the Japanese side's concern is not the four Chinese nationals but the silver in the British Concession in Tianjin. (American United Press, 2nd)

### Toshio Shiratori Recalled to Japan

Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abe today ordered the recall of Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Toshio Shiratori. It is said that his successor will be formally appointed soon. According to political circles, Shiratori's recall is due to poor health and he intends to return home for recuperation. However, many foreigners believe that Shiratori was a staunch advocate of Japan joining the German-Italian military alliance. Since the formation of the new cabinet, there has been a significant change in Japan's foreign policy, so there is no other way but to recall Shiratori. It is also said that Shiratori was extremely disappointed with the establishment of the Soviet-German military alliance. It is further reported that the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, has also requested permission to resign and cede his position to someone more capable, citing his poor health as the reason. However, the Foreign Ministry has urged him to stay, believing that in the current situation, Japan needs a capable observer to monitor the European situation at all times.

The commercial treaty concluded between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Republic of China will provide closer assistance to future economic and cultural cooperation beneficial to the peoples of both countries. In the current extremely tense international situation, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics' policy of loving peace and providing friendly assistance to invaded nations is inseparable.

Your Excellency, Ambassador, today I am very pleased to accept your credentials as the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the Republic of China. The Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are the largest contiguous countries in the world, and the friendship between the two peoples is natural and sincere. The recent signing of the commercial treaty has further enhanced the inherent amity between the two countries. Your Excellency's arrival in this country with the mission of developing and consolidating the cooperation between the two countries based on this friendship will undoubtedly deepen the relationship between the two countries and be mutually beneficial. The Republic of China is resisting armed aggression with the full strength of its people in order to maintain its freedom and independence. In this difficult and sacred struggle, we have not only received the boundless sympathy of your country, but also your effective assistance. This sympathy and assistance are sufficient proof of the consistent anti-aggression policy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The Chinese government and people are therefore increasingly confident that our struggle will achieve a glorious victory. I am extremely grateful for the ardent hope expressed by Your Excellency, Ambassador. The people of the Republic of China will also be deeply moved by this expression. I wish to inform Your Excellency, Ambassador, that the government of the Republic of China will do its utmost to provide Your Excellency with all necessary conveniences and assistance during your term of office, so that Your Excellency may accomplish the important mission entrusted to you.

### Invading Japanese Troops in Guangdong Attempt to Attack Huiyang, Already Contained; Chinese Troops Strike Directly at Dongguan County Seat

Hong Kong Dispatch: Invading Japanese troops in Guangdong, numbering about ten thousand, are approaching the East River, intending to use all their strength to open up the coastal route in the eastern region, so that the area from Huiyang to Chao-Shan will be completely within the Japanese army's sphere of influence. From a military perspective, this will eliminate the regret of having various port strongholds isolated; politically, it will provide a foothold to control Guangzhou after the Japanese troops withdraw from Guangzhou in the future when the puppet regime in Guangzhou is established. The Japanese army's plan to invade Huiyang is divided into three routes, with the main force taking the route along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway at Pinghu Station, turning into the Hui-Zhang Highway. Although Pinghu has been seized by the Japanese army using all their artillery and cavalry, the Chinese army is holding the Shima exit of the Hui-Zhang Highway, relying on the mountains on both sides to block the Japanese army's advance, and is using fresh troops to assist the regiment in firmly defending the road to ensure the safety between Huiyang and Bo Luo. On the 19th, more than 3,000 Japanese troops once attacked Shima. The guerrilla team of the 4th Column of the Chinese army, together with the 8th Regiment of the Security Corps, met the enemy head-on. On that day, the two sides fought fiercely. Although the Japanese army used aircraft and artillery to cover the advance of their troops, the Chinese army's position had natural defenses and was not destroyed by Japanese aircraft. On the 20th, the Chinese army regiments led by Yuan Hua Zhao, Zhang Yu, and Ye Tieliang launched a counterattack against the Japanese army with high morale, killing many Japanese troops from morning to noon. The Japanese army transferred troops from Shenzhen to provide reinforcements, and the two sides were still in stalemate until the evening of the 20th. As for the Japanese army that slanted out of Longgang, it initially planned to join forces with the Japanese marines landing at Ao Tou to flank the southwest of Huiyang. However, the Japanese troops in Danshui were driven back to their ships by the local regiment. The Japanese troops who rushed out of the Zhenlong Highway from Longgang were intercepted by fresh Chinese troops on the 19th. At the same time, the 3rd Guerrilla Column of Danshui also joined forces with the Chinese army to launch a counterattack. The Japanese army, which had already occupied Longgang, could not hold on and retreated to Henggang in disarray. Therefore, on the 20th, the Chinese army in the Zhangmutou area took the opportunity to launch a counterattack, and the Japanese army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line was busy reinforcing. When the Japanese army invaded Huiyang in different directions on the 19th, they sent a team of puppet troops on civilian boats to go up the East River to Bo Luo to contain the Chinese army defending Huiyang and Bo Luo. On the 19th, when they sailed to the vicinity of Ma Sisu Village, they were intercepted by the Chinese army and the militia, and could not advance. On the 20th, because the Japanese troops in Zhangmutou could not penetrate deeply, the puppet troops who came out to disturb the area by waterway did not dare to move forward easily.

In order to break the Japanese army's plot to invade Huiyang, the Chinese army is also using many teams of militia and guerrillas to deal with the situation in different directions and to attack deep into the Japanese army's rear. The 3rd Battalion of the 4th Guerrilla Column, led by Liu Fayu, launched a surprise attack from near Zhongtang on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway on the 18th, striking directly at the Dongguan County seat. At that time, the Japanese and puppet troops in Shilong and Dongguan City had been mostly transferred to Shenzhen Pinghu and to disturb the south bank of the East River, so their strength was weak. The guerrillas of the Liu Battalion advanced sharply along the way and approached Dongguan County seat on the 19th, bombing and destroying the Japanese army's artillery fortresses outside the city. The Japanese and puppet troops did not dare to fight back. Later, the Japanese troops in the Taiping area heard the news and sent 600 troops to provide reinforcements. The Liu Battalion then retreated to the outskirts of Dongguan City, controlling the Japanese army. This battle has had a significant impact on the Japanese army's operations in the Shenzhen area.

### Chinese Troops in Tongshan Break Through Jiawang Coal Mine, Kill 67 Japanese Soldiers, Capture 85 Puppet Police

Xuzhou Dispatch: The Jiawang Coal Mine Company northeast of Xuzhou was raided and destroyed by Hu Lide, the commander of the 3rd Standing Battalion, sent by Guo Jie Xuan, the magistrate of Tongshan County, in early August. More than 80 puppet police guarding the mine were eliminated, and the Jia-Liu Railway was destroyed, derailing a Japanese military train. After receiving the report, Deputy Commander Zhi Honghan immediately issued an order of commendation. Guo Changxuan's report briefly stated that the puppet police of the Jiawang Coal Mine Company had defected and blown up the mine shaft. This was done by Hu Lide, the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the county, and others, who captured 32 puppet police and 53 who surrendered after two attacks on the old kiln, a total of 85. They are now being moved to and are planned to be incorporated into the standing team for training. The situation in Jiawang Liuquan is chaotic. Because the Jiawang was attacked, the Jia-Liu Railway was also destroyed, causing considerable losses to the Japanese side, which sent cavalry, infantry, and tanks to conduct a strict search, resulting in a chaotic situation there. The telegram also stated that on the morning of July 30, Hu Battalion Commander led and technical team members were responsible for destroying a section of the Jia-Liu Railway, overturning a west-bound coal train. The No. 9 locomotive was also blown up. After a fierce attack by the Chinese side, a total of 67 Japanese soldiers were killed. When the Japanese army used tanks to provide reinforcements, the Chinese army temporarily avoided them. At midnight on the 31st, they destroyed several miles of the Jia-Liu Road, causing great fear to the Japanese side. On the night of August 2, more than 200 Chinese soldiers attacked the Jiawang Kiln, offering a reward of 200 yuan to recruit a 50-member suicide squad to charge forward, killing more than 10 Japanese soldiers and capturing more than 30 puppet police, obtaining 42 rifles, and so on.

### Near Xietang in Suzhou, Chinese Troops Defeat Puppet Police, Puppet Captain Barely Escapes

Suzhou Dispatch: The entire team of the 2nd General Team of Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Police is composed of beggars and bandits. However, these puppet police are difficult to tame and often carry their inferior firearms to the villages and towns near the city to engage in looting. On the 25th of last month, the commander of the puppet police team, Ma Heng, accompanied by the Japanese instructor, Zhouzhao Mizuta, led a team of 80 soldiers, riding a steamer, to Xietang Town outside Fengmen Gate for inspection. After the inspection, they took the original boat back to Suzhou. However, when they reached Jinji Lake (the second of the Seven Great Lakes of Wu County), they were surrounded by Chinese troops and a fierce battle broke out. In less than half an hour, the Chinese troops had killed more than half of the puppet police. The remaining puppet police accelerated their horsepower and fled towards Suzhou City. The Chinese troops did not pursue them. After Ma and others fled back to Suzhou City, they urgently reported to the puppet provincial government and the Japanese military authorities. After receiving the report, the Japanese army sent a large number of Japanese and puppet troops, but the Chinese troops had already gone elsewhere.

### After the Fall of Dinghai, Thugs Seize the Opportunity for Profit, Captured and Beaten to Death by Villagers

Dinghai Dispatch: Yang, a clerk of Yancang Township, and a certain team leader, seized the opportunity to loot in the countryside after the fall of Dinghai. They also falsely claimed to collect conscription donations, coercing each Bao to donate 20 yuan, so the general villagers were very angry. A few nights ago, Yang and the team leader were passing by Dun Tou Wang when local residents heard the news and formed a team, carrying sticks and hoes on their backs, captured the two men, beat them to death on the spot, and threw their bodies into the sea. For a time, the people were overjoyed.

### Miao Bin Ambushed, But Not Hit

Xuzhou Dispatch: Miao Bin, former Director of the Soviet People's Affairs Department, a native of Wuxi, is now the Director of the Guidance Department of the Puppet Xinmin Association in Beiping. The other day, when the Xuzhou Da Min Association Guidance Department was established, Miao took a plane to Xu. When he got off the plane, someone threw a bomb to assassinate him among a group of puppet officials who were welcoming him, causing great chaos for a while. Miao was fortunately not hit, but was greatly frightened. Afterwards, the Xuzhou Japanese military headquarters believed that there were anti-Japanese factions among the welcoming personnel, so they have closely monitored everyone.

The Shanghai Market Experiences Drastic Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Due to the Impact of the European War; Both British and American Exchange Rates Lengthen; The Legal Tender Becomes More Stable; Prices of Foreign Goods Soar; Transactions Are Chaotic.

After a long period of maneuvering, the German army suddenly launched military operations against Poland in one day. The Shanghai industrial, commercial, and financial sectors were affected by the news of the outbreak of the European War, and the market felt a considerable impact. However, due to the US President's statement, "He can ensure that the United States does not get involved in the European War vortex," the scope of the European War in this port is difficult to predict at this time. However, due to the clear indication of the United States' ability, there should be no sudden and major changes in the Shanghai market. The exchange market is now trending to ease, and gold prices are falling, which is increasingly beneficial to the foundation of China's legal tender. Those in various industries who own European goods are taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the firmness of the people's minds and are not planning to exchange goods. The details are as follows:

Black Market Exchange Rates Ease, Legal Tender Prices Stabilize

The Shanghai black market began to ease yesterday. The foreign exchange listing of the British HSBC Bank remained unchanged, but the actual market rate was 4 shillings and a half for British exchange and 7.75 yuan for American exchange. General speculators in the market are flocking to the market, and there is a trend of supply exceeding demand. During the European War in the Republic of China, the British exchange rate reached 9 shillings. Therefore, the public believes that foreign exchange will become increasingly loose, and the United States is making every effort to avoid being involved in the vortex. Therefore, the US exchange rate and the British exchange rate have parted ways. The legal foreign exchange rates announced by the Central Bank every day remain stable as always: (1) 1 shilling and 2 and a half pence for British exchange; (2) 30 US dollars for American exchange.

Gold Securities Plunge in the Gray Market

Due to the outbreak of the European War, people were panicked in the gold and securities gray market, rumors arose, and prices fell sharply. (1) The closing price of gold was 3,575 yuan at noon, and 3,525 yuan in the afternoon, a sharp drop of more than 500 yuan compared to the previous day. The price listed in silver houses has dropped to 350 yuan. (2) The closing price of unified national bonds yesterday afternoon was 557.2 yuan for Type A, down 1.2 yuan; 45.05 yuan for Type B, down 9.5 fen; 43.05 yuan for Type C, down 1.05 yuan; 41.9 yuan for Type D, down 1 yuan; 42.65 yuan for Type E, down 1 yuan.

High Prices of Foreign Goods Have an Impact

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the import and export sector yesterday: (1) The Shanghai market has already felt the impact of imported foreign goods.顏料·五金·機器。呢絨。疋頭。洋雜貨等, because those who own the goods are all waiting and seeing, and do not intend to sell the goods, while those who own the assets are hoarding for profit, causing the prices of foreign goods to soar, and the market transactions are chaotic. Among them,顏料·五金·洋針等 are particularly serious. It is said that some German orders have been cancelled due to the war. (2) The export of local goods, except for the United States and the Soviet Union, etc., which are still normal and unaffected, the French side has already telegraphed Shanghai to stop the silk business. Therefore, the price of silk has plummeted, and the Shanghai market has no market and the transaction is almost at a standstill. As of now, the export of tung oil, bristles, tea, and minerals to the United Kingdom and the United States has not been affected.

China's Finance Will Become More Beneficial

Regarding China's entire financial system, it is expected to remain stable as always. The easing of the black market foreign exchange rate will increase the value of the legal tender, so it is increasingly beneficial to China's legal tender. As for the drastic changes in the Shanghai financial market, it is entirely caused by speculators and has nothing to do with China's entire financial system. The Chinese government will still supply legal foreign exchange for the import of legitimate goods as much as possible, and the export of local goods will still be able to receive the difference in foreign exchange fees. China's legal tender reserves are still abundant and are the highest in the world. Moreover, 90% of the reserves stored abroad are in the United States, so there will definitely not be any problems.

British Destroyer Leaves Shanghai Yesterday Morning

According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the British destroyer Duncan left the British naval pontoon in the Huangpu River at 10:30 this morning (the 2nd) and sailed down the river very quickly, which surprised the onlookers on the Bund. Its destination is unknown.

Three German Ships Stop in Kobe

According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the mystery of the missing German ships Xianghuostu, Aierpi, and Kemolan No. 3 has now been solved. It is said that all three ships are afraid of Kobe. Since there is a threat of war between Germany and Britain and France, the German ships have not kept to their original route in the past few days and have not sailed near the ports of Britain. The news that three or more German ships are now avoiding in Japan is quite surprising.

According to reports, the Xianghuostu left Shanghai on August 21. After arriving in Manila, it sailed to Singapore, but suddenly returned to Manila. It is said that 20 passengers would rather not reach their destination and disembark in Manila. It is now reported that the Xianghuostu has arrived in Kobe yesterday (the 1st), and most of the other passengers are still on board. Mr. Ke Tou, the Norwegian Minister to China and Japan, took the ship from Shanghai to start and was a passenger. It is said that the Kemolan had not arrived in Manila by the due date a few days ago. The ship apparently did not sail to that place and sailed directly to Kobe. Italian ships are also avoiding sailing to British ports. The Italian ship Kangtiebikano, which had 150 passengers bound for India, did not dock in Mumbai and is expected to sail directly to Masoya. In addition, the Italian ship Ruliangaisha was scheduled to load passengers in Shanghai for Europe. After docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf for several days, it moved to the Texaco oil depot in Pudong on the Huangpu River yesterday afternoon to refuel. The ship will leave Shanghai soon. It is impossible to know for sure this morning, but the public believes that a team of ten Italian naval and marine corps soldiers has boarded the ship.

French Mail Ship Changxing Sails as Usual

Due to the tense situation in Europe, the various foreign merchant ships in the port have been prepared for a long time, but there was no action yesterday. The French mail ship Qinlabao, which was originally scheduled to stay in Saigon, is expected to enter the port at 8:00 AM today and dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will transfer to small boats and land at the Customs Wharf at 10:00 AM. The ship will also transport 11,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon. After the cargo is unloaded, it will still sail to Japan according to the original schedule at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning (the 4th) and return to Shanghai on the 11th of this month. The Queen of Japan, a Changxing company, went to Hong Kong and Little Luzon in the middle of last month and is now on its way back. It is scheduled to arrive today (the 3rd) at 3:00 PM and dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will take small boats and land at the Customs Wharf at 4:30 PM. The large ship is scheduled to leave the anchor at 8:30 AM tomorrow morning (the 4th) and return to Canada via Japan and Honolulu. The boat for passengers will depart from the Customs Wharf at 11:00 PM tonight. The company's Queen of Asia left Vancouver on the 19th of last month and came to Shanghai via Japan. It is scheduled to enter the port at 3:30 PM tomorrow (the 4th) and dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will take a small fireboat and land at the Customs Wharf at 5:00 PM. The large ship will leave the port early at 11:00 PM on the same day (the 4th) and go to Hong Kong and Little Luzon. The boat for passengers will depart from the Customs Wharf at 9:30 PM on the 4th.

Efforts to Dredge the Export of Local Goods

The Chinese government is deeply concerned that the outbreak of the European War will affect the export of Chinese local goods. Therefore, the Trade Commission is making every effort to ensure that the export of major local goods is not affected by the European War. In the past, the export of local goods was concentrated in Hong Kong. Now, new export routes have been opened up. Attention has been paid to countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union, because the government has signed contracts with the United States and the Soviet Union to exchange goods. However, so far, except for the silk business in France, which has been affected, the export of other local goods has not been significantly affected.

Japanese Residents Take Action

According to the Zilin Daily, at a reception for journalists held by the Japanese side yesterday, someone asked what action the Japanese authorities had ordered Japanese civilians in any part of the Far East to take in the event of the outbreak of the European War. A spokesman for the Japanese ambassador replied, "Not yet." He did not know whether any orders would be issued.

Hitler's Moves after the German Invasion of Shanghai: German Merchants Rush to Withdraw Goods from Warehouses; Lilihua and Far East Ships Await Orders in Zhenhai

As Germany and Poland have begun military action, German merchants in this port have become uneasy. Defu Foreign Company specifically notified the Shanghai Xiyanliao Industry Association yesterday, asking them to inform their counterparts to clear out the warehouse receipts that have been issued to avoid accidents and not to be responsible. The original letter is translated as follows: "Please clear out the warehouse receipts issued by our company immediately. We are not responsible for any accidents." After receiving the letter, the association has notified its members and customers to be aware.

German Ships Await Orders in Zhenhai

As the conflict between Germany and Poland has surfaced, the Shipping Department of Lilihua Foreign Company and the Far East Company in this city has not received any instructions from the German leadership regarding the actions of the Moufu, Haifu, and Hanna ships as of yesterday. All three ships are anchored outside the mouth of Zhenhai, waiting to unload their cargo. The unloading must be carried out in order, and it is not easy to return to Shanghai for a while. Future changes are currently unpredictable.

Shipping is Unobstructed

The German Pinglun and Enderlund of the Italian Zhongyi Company and the Shililun of the Yihua Foreign Company and the Yingzhou Lun of Taikoo Company still normally operate the Shanghai Ningbo line, so passenger and freight transportation can be unobstructed. At present, because the Ningbo authorities are evacuating the population, the export of women and children has not been prohibited. At the same time, because the cost of living in Shanghai is so high, it is not easy to stay, so passengers coming to Shanghai from Ningbo and going to Ningbo from Shanghai are quite busy.

Polish Ambassador Wei Duntao Returns Home Today

Wei Duntao, the Polish ambassador to China, has been in Shanghai for 20 years since taking office in 1919. After Mr. Wei took office in China, he signed the Sino-Polish Friendship Treaty with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, making every effort to promote Sino-Polish relations. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the National Government moved west. Although Mr. Wei was old and sick, and Wang, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, repeatedly sent telegrams urging him to go west, he never got his wish. Recently, the situation in Europe has become tense, and the Polish government has concentrated diplomatic talents. Therefore, it specifically summoned Mr. Wei to return home. The position of ambassador to China has been filled by Mr. Baster, who was newly appointed by the Polish government as chargé d'affaires. Before Mr. Ba arrives, it will be temporarily taken over by Consul General Bao Huomoreisi. Mr. Wei has decided to take the Queen of Japan of Changxing Company from Shanghai at 6:00 AM today. Sino-Western friends in the sea and staff of the embassy have arrived at the port this morning to welcome him.

The Ministry of Finance Encourages Savings Deposits, and the Income Tax Handling Fee Continues to be Refunded

The Ministry of Finance sent a true telegram to the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association, saying: "I have read the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association's case regarding the special approval of a 10% handling fee refund to depositors for income tax on deposit interest. The original deadline was June 30 of this year. However, during this extraordinary period, in order to encourage savings and strengthen finance, and out of consideration for hardship, this case will be allowed to continue to be implemented before the end of the war. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan and submitting it to the National Government for filing and issuing orders, you are required to inform your counterparts to comply and deduct the tax in a practical manner."

Finance Minister Kong Speaks Out About the Collection of Counterfeit Currency by Customs: Violation of Government Laws is Absolutely Intolerable; Counterfeit Currency Cannot be Exchanged for Foreign Exchange

(ReChongqing on the 2nd) Regarding the counterfeit order issued by the counterfeit supervisor of the Jianghai Customs, ordering the customs to collect and use the counterfeit banknotes of the "Huaxing Bank" from September 1, which undermines the customs gold system, the Central News Agency reporter went to visit President Kong of the Executive Yuan to inquire about the content. The answer was roughly as follows: "The personnel of the Shanghai Customs all belong to the Chinese government. If they betray their trust and accept counterfeit orders from institutions other than legitimate organs of the National Government, I cannot believe it. If the customs implements this counterfeit order or other counterfeit orders, not only will the customs rights enjoyed by friendly governments and people be greatly infringed, but the development of the entire Shanghai commerce will also be affected. This is very obvious." President Kong also said, "Regarding this matter, the government has telegraphed the General Tax Office to instruct the customs commissioners of each customs to pay all customs import duties in legal currency according to the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank. Any measures that violate the law are absolutely not tolerated by the government."

After the Jianghai Customs was Forced to Accept "Huaxing Coupons," the Tax Collection Office of the Bank of China Was Forcibly Occupied; Tax Collectors Withdrew and Were Temporarily Transferred to the Shanghai Branch, Awaiting Instructions from the Head Office; Trade Between Various Countries and China Has Been Repelled; The Exchange Rate Announced by the "Supervisory Office" is a Tax Increase in Disguise; The Details Are as Follows:

Tax Collectors Temporarily Transferred to the Shanghai Branch

After the tax collection office of the Central Bank Jianghai Customs was forcibly occupied by Japanese personnel sent by the Yokohama Zhengjin Bank, the tax collectors of the Bank of China were forced to withdraw. After the director of the tax collection office, Mr. Shen, asked the director of the Shanghai branch, all the personnel of the tax collection office were temporarily transferred to work in the Shanghai branch, and the situation of being forced to withdraw was reported to the Chongqing head office. Now they are waiting for instructions from the head office. However, the bank has always refused to accept "Huaxing Coupons," and the legal tender price of customs gold is still announced as usual. On the 2nd, one yuan of customs gold was converted into 2.58 yuan of legal tender, which is calculated based on London pure gold.

After the Forcible Occupation, the Exchange Rate is Announced

After the Yokohama Zhengjin Bank forcibly occupied the tax collection office of the Central Bank Jianghai Customs, the "Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office" announced the exchange rate of customs gold converted into "Huaxing Coupons" from the 1st. The exchange rate announced on the 2nd was 2.564 yuan of "Huaxing Coupons" for one yuan of customs gold, and 1.55 yuan of legal tender for one yuan of "Huaxing Coupons." If taxes are paid in legal tender, it is 3.975 yuan of legal tender for one yuan of customs gold. However, the customs gold mentioned by the "Supervisory Office" is only nominally in name and is not calculated based on the London pure gold market. The foreign exchange price of "Huaxing Coupons" is assumed to be 6 pence in British currency.

Foreign Commerce Will Inevitably Suffer

According to the Continental Daily, the Yokohama Zhengjin Bank sent 33 Japanese employees to the tax collection office of the Central Bank Jianghai Customs yesterday (the 1st) to implement the new regulations on collecting customs duties and all taxes in Huaxing currency, and announced that Huaxing currency is converted into 1.55 yuan of national currency. A reporter recently asked an important businessman about this matter. According to him, "Foreign commerce in Shanghai will inevitably suffer. Since no one can predict what the conversion rate will be tomorrow, merchants cannot determine how much their foreign goods will cost when they actually arrive."

The Final Result is to Squeeze Shanghai Out

Before the implementation of this regulation, foreign merchants here could estimate the value of their imported goods in legal tender with the help of the customs gold unit system. Under the current arrangement, the legal tender is arbitrarily determined by the puppet bank and the Japanese side every day. There will inevitably be unrest among foreign merchants in this port. However, this is still the smallest of the disasters of the new customs regulations. The final result is that foreign commerce is squeezed out of Shanghai.

It is Difficult to Obtain Foreign Exchange by Forcibly Using Counterfeit Currency

Since the devaluation of the legal tender, foreign commerce in Shanghai and other places has suffered losses. However, merchants can still obtain unlimited foreign exchange in the market, and some can even obtain foreign exchange at the exchange rate of the Chinese government. If Huaxing currency is once in general circulation, merchants will not be able to obtain foreign exchange without the written permission of the Japanese government. Huaxing currency has hardly reached the status of being called "currency."

A Proposal Once Advocated Was Rejected

The counterfeit bank has only issued 2 million yuan worth of banknotes so far, which is far from enough for Shanghai to circulate. Those who are not in general circulation are not called "currency." The current amount of legal tender in circulation in Shanghai is 60 million yuan. Now, because the customs revenue has been drastically reduced, the Japanese side has taken this action. In July, the Japanese authorities once proposed to implement new regulations, but it was immediately rejected by the Tokyo financial community, because they were still afraid that foreign commerce would be severely hit by this plan and take retaliatory measures.

Customs Revenue Will Not Improve

In the first half of this year, the revenue of the Jianghai Customs was 72 million yuan, which was deposited in the Yokohama Zhengjin Bank. At that time, the average value of the legal tender was 6 pence, and the Japanese side obtained about 2.5 million pounds in British currency. Now that the legal tender has devalued and foreign trade has also declined, the customs revenue in the second half of the year will naturally decrease. Observers believe that the total customs revenue in the second half of the year will not exceed 48 million yuan. According to the current exchange rate, the Japanese side will receive 750,000 pounds in British currency. However, by collecting customs duties and other taxes in Huaxing currency, the Japanese side will increase its income from customs by at least 55% in the next few months this year.

Counterfeit Currency Cannot be Exchanged for Foreign Exchange

As for the Japanese claim that Huaxing currency is pegged to 6 pence in British currency and can be used to purchase foreign exchange, it is all a deception of the public. The Japanese side sets the exchange rate and uses Huaxing currency to exchange for legal tender. In addition, there are only 2 million yuan of Huaxing currency in circulation. Even if all of it is obtained, the amount of foreign exchange that can be purchased is limited.

German Consul General Returns to Shanghai Yesterday

German Consul General Fei Shier returned to Shanghai yesterday.

The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee Sent Zhu Xinggong a Funeral Gift of 1,000 Yuan and Requested the Central Committee to Issue an Order of Commendation

(Chongqing, 1st) Zhu Songlu, pen name Xinggong, editor of the supplement "Night Light" of the Shanghai Great American Evening Post, was assassinated by thugs in Shanghai on August 30. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee believes that Mr. Zhu has been the editor of the Great American Supplement for many years and has made every effort to promote the war of resistance. His assassination is deeply regretted. In addition to sending a telegram of condolences to Mr. Zhu's family and remitting a funeral gift of 1,000 yuan, it will also request the Central Committee to issue an order of commendation to comfort his heroic spirit.

Four Chinese in the Tianjin Peace Case Believe They Have Not Yet Been Handed Over; All Matters Related to this Case Will Be Decided at the Hearing; The British Military Commander Must Send a Representative to Shanghai

According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the Shanghai Ellis Law Office, which is acting for four Chinese terrorist suspects detained by the British authorities in Tianjin, believes this morning (the 2nd) that the four suspects have not yet been handed over to the Japanese authorities in North China. According to a lawyer at the law office, he has telegraphed Tianjin, but a telegram is required from the Tianjin representative reporting that the four men have been handed over. Judge Jones has issued a summons to the British authorities in Tianjin who detained the four men. All matters related to this case will be decided at the hearing on the summons on September 11. At that time, it will be ruled whether the writ of habeas corpus applies to non-British people detained by the British side.

The British Consulate Has Also Telegraphed Tianjin to Inquire

In addition, according to news, the British Embassy in this port telegraphed the British Consulate in Tianjin urgently on the 31st of last month to inquire about the truth about the transfer of four Chinese suspects in the Tianjin assassination case. As of the 1st, there was still no reply. The British Embassy is quite concerned about this and telegraphed the British Consulate in Dajin again at 3:30 PM on the 1st to make a second determination and request a prompt reply on the action in this case.

Sir Mossa is Scheduled to Hear the Case

However, the public believes that the British Concession authorities in Tianjin have not yet implemented the extradition in accordance with the British government's order for the four prisoners they are detaining. As for their fate, it is unknown. According to Judge Jones, who is handling the case, the Tianjin British Concession authorities have not accepted the case for handling. Therefore, the British military commander in Tianjin, Luo Lei, must be summoned to court to testify. If Commander Luo cannot attend the court, he must send a legal representative to come here. The summons will be debated here on the 11th of this month. The hearer will be Judge Mossa, who has just returned to Shanghai from Japan to avoid the summer heat.

Yesterday at around 8:00 PM, a Japanese No. 14 iron barge, fully loaded with heavy quantities of transported goods, cursed and sailed to the vicinity of Yangshupu. Due to the excessive load, it could not support it and suddenly sank into the Huangpu River. The Japanese side is still salvaging it.

Japanese Navy Vows to Blockade Meizhou Port in Southern Fujian

Notification to All Countries' Ships to Leave by the 6th

(Shanghai News on the 2nd) The Japanese Navy authorities have decided to blockade the waters around Meizhou Port in the southernmost part of Fujian Province. The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai notified the diplomatic representatives and customs authorities of various countries on the morning of the 3rd that the Japanese Navy will blockade Meizhou Port in Fujian Province on the morning of September 6. The area is near the line close to Xiaozhaishan and Luoges (transliteration) near Meizhou Port and near the line connecting Laowan (transliteration) and Xiaote (transliteration). All countries' ships are hoped to leave this area before the 6th.

The National Government Massively Reserves Military Grain and Food for Wartime

Restricting the Brewing of Major Food Grains for Accumulation; Shanghai Merchants Massively Purchase Rice from the Interior, Raising Prices

The National Government is extremely concerned about the military and civilian food supply during wartime. Since the promulgation of the Food Adjustment Measures during the Emergency Period, all provinces, cities, and counties have successively established food transportation and sales agencies to preside over food chain sales and adjustment matters. Food associations have been universally established in areas close to the war zone and in important areas in the interior. The production of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains in various provinces in the interior, such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, and Guangxi, has greatly increased after the government encouraged food production. It is now known that this year's food supply can be said to be a bumper harvest due to favorable weather conditions and improved planting methods. In order to prevent the improper consumption of food, the government has again ordered the local authorities of various provinces to restrict the brewing of major food grains for large-scale Jiao Lei preparation to meet the needs of the long-term war of resistance. The hoarding and manipulation by dishonest people and the smuggling and external transportation are strictly prohibited to stabilize market prices.

Reasons for the High Prices in Northern Jiangsu

Taizhou, Taixing, and Rugao and other places in northern Jiangsu have had a bumper harvest of early rice this year, and the price is also surprisingly cheap. Therefore, rice merchants from all over the country have flocked to these places to purchase in large quantities, causing the local selling price to rise by several yuan from 13 yuan. In addition, the cost of shipping to Shanghai, including taxes and transportation costs along the way, has also risen by several yuan from 18 yuan. Therefore, customers who have already handled the business have also sold it at a good price locally, resulting in stagnation of goods transported to Shanghai.

Rice Shops in Shanghai Gradually Strengthen Their Appetite

Yesterday, there was not much rice arriving in Shanghai. The holders of goods believed that the time was ripe and sold more than 10,000 bags in the market. At the same time, the appetite of the rice shops was very strong. Although retail sales were scarce, the inventory was very thin, so they all bought the rice. In total, more than 9,000 bags were traded. The price of each stall in the morning market rose by one yuan, and the price of the late market rose by 5 to 7 jiao.

Rice Boats Detained in Pudong Are Released

On the day before yesterday, 15 rice boats transporting rice to Shanghai from Southern Huangpu, totaling 3,750 bags, were detained by the Japanese army on Dongchang Road. On the 31st, two more boats were detained, totaling about 4,000 bags. The Japanese text plans to force the sale of the rice in the occupied area. After many negotiations by rice merchants, all of them were released until today, but their losses have been considerable.

The Interest Rates of Pawnshops are Not Uniform

In the past, the interest rate of pawnshops in this city was mostly 1.8%, and the maturity period was 18 months. Before the war, due to the low price of goods, there was a considerable loss after the pawned goods matured and were not redeemed due to changes in style. Therefore, a movement was launched to shorten the pawn period to one year, but it failed due to the recovery of commodity prices and the different opinions of the industry. After the war, commodity prices soared. Except for pawnshops in the war zone, pawnshops in the concession mostly made profits, because only gold and silver jewelry in the pawned goods were considerable. Other clothing, copper, tin, and other full goods were also quite profitable. Therefore, it is unreasonable for pawnshops to increase interest rates at this time. However, the industry finally implemented a unified interest rate of 2% from September 1. However, the situation of pawnshops in the concession is very complicated. Not only do the new and old members of the industry have their own doors, with differences in status, but there are also potential pawnshops. Therefore, in practice, the interest charged by pawnshops in the concession from September 1 is still not uniform. For example, the interest charged for pawn loans can even reach 30 to 40%. The maturity of the pawned goods is even more chaotic. Some are 18 months, some are 12 months, and some are even 6 months or even several months. This is indeed an obstacle to the livelihood of the poor.

Commodity Prices Soar and Food Rations Double; Disaster Relief is Needed Urgently

The Industry Group of the Refugee Relief Association notified the industry associations yesterday that the cost of food rations for refugees in this city has increased several times due to soaring commodity prices. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association feels the seriousness of the situation and visited the Dutch authorities. After convening a meeting, it was resolved that all disaster relief activities held by all sectors of society should be increased or continued. It is the duty of our people to bear the burden of relieving refugees and is also the most serious problem in society. In this difficult situation, our business colleagues should take the lead in supporting this charity. In addition to distributing letters, all disaster relief activities held by your association that have not set a deadline at the beginning of the event are urgently hoped to continue to be collected. Those who have set a deadline are requested to consider the suffering of the refugees and the hidden worries of society and must continue to hold the event without interruption.

The Citizens Group of the Double Refugee Relief Association released the fundraising statistics as of the end of August as follows:

Donation Statistics: Donations received totaled 254,997.277 yuan, 15,724 yuan collected by the association on behalf, and 50,000 yuan receivable and uncollected, totaling 320,721.277 yuan in fundraising donations.

Sponsorship Statistics: 12,490 households participated in the sponsorship, totaling 16,369 people.

The North China Flood May Give Priority to Emergency Relief

The China Foreign Relief Society is in charge of actively carrying out relief for the North China flood. The first batch of protective medicines will be boxed up in the near future and sent directly to Tianjin. After contacting Honorary President Sun Zhongying, who reported by telegram from Tianjin, it has been decided to hold a board of directors meeting on the 5th of this month (Tuesday) to determine a specific relief plan and engage in work. Or the association will allocate some funds to handle emergency relief first, and then solicit donations from all sectors of society, both Chinese and foreign. It is deeply hoped that all sectors will donate soil, bandits, or medicines and enthusiastically support the effort. It is also heard that the Tianjin Zhongyuan Company and the Zhongyuan Bank have automatically organized the Zhongyuan Company Disaster Relief Association to prepare steamed buns, medicines, and drinks, and load them on two large ships every day to distribute them to the disaster areas. In the past two days, they have assisted more than 5,000 disaster victims.

Chinese Police in the Public Concession Hope for Subsidies

With the Follow-up Call, Yu Qiaqing Requested to Make a Proposal on His Behalf

According to the New Voice News Agency, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Public Concession Board, is enthusiastic about public undertakings in the concession. For example, his efforts to purchase foreign rice to maintain the people's food supply have been supported by all sectors of society. The Chinese police under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Public Concession Patrol Room number in the thousands. Their wages are mostly between 30 and 40 yuan, and some are only more than 20 yuan. During this period of soaring cost of living, rice costs more than 30 yuan per stone, and other necessities such as water, electricity, rent, firewood, and coal are all high. It is very difficult to maintain a family of several people with this. It is recently heard that the Chinese police in various patrol rooms have submitted letters to Mr. Yu, asking him to advocate for justice and ask the authorities to provide appropriate subsidies to maintain their livelihood. Mr. Yu expressed his deep sympathy and is said to be preparing to propose to the Board to increase the subsidies for Chinese police.

Cholera is Prevalent

Seventeen Patients in Four Days

The weather in this port is extremely cool in the heat of summer. After entering autumn, it suddenly becomes hot. Except for the temperature that dropped briefly after the hurricane passed a few days ago, the average temperature is above 90 degrees. Therefore, the health effects caused by this abnormal climate are very large. True cholera has spread from sporadic to epidemic. According to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, in addition to the 16 cases that had been reported to the Industry Bureau for chemical laboratory testing and confirmed to be true cholera, 17 new cases have been discovered in

Weekly Supplement Modern Figures Hitler's Secret Wei Sheng
### Key to Victory
Since Hitler seized power in Germany, he has recovered the Saar, annexed Austria, and destroyed Czechoslovakia, his arrogance soaring and unmatched! Recently, he has again used the issue of Danzig and the Polish Corridor as an excuse to deploy troops and openly provoke, making it impossible to maintain peace in Europe. The power of life and death of millions of people is actually in his hands!
What extraordinary abilities or secret to victory does Hitler possess? According to the views of a certain French writer, Hitler's secret, when revealed, is very ordinary. In a nutshell, he knows that to defeat an enemy, one must overcome their resistance. And this so-called resistance contains two inseparable elements: first, their ability to fight; second, their determination to exert this ability.

Winning Hearts is Paramount
If the enemy's fighting power is extremely weak but their spirit of resistance is very high, Hitler will first try every means to use his tricks of sowing discord and his methods of coercion and inducement to weaken the enemy's spirit of resistance; then, he can conquer them without firing a shot. As for those hypothetical enemies with extraordinarily strong fighting power, Hitler dare not easily deal with them. He must redouble his efforts to ease their rebellious emotions and shake their determination to fight. The great principle in Chinese military strategy, "The best way to use troops is to attack the mind, next is to attack cities," Hitler not only understands but also is quite capable of applying in practice.
Take his destruction of Czechoslovakia as an example. Before the Munich Agreement was signed, Czechoslovakia believed it could rely on foreign aid and sit back and relax. Even if Hitler carried out aggression as a villain, Czechoslovakia would only suffer deeply within a few months of the start of the war, and ultimate victory would certainly be assured. Unexpectedly, in September of last year, Britain and France changed their minds, while Germany, Hungary, Poland, and other countries exerted pressure at the same time, which completely despaired Czechoslovakia and forced it to painfully conclude the "Treaty of Surrender!" Originally, those who destroy a country generally first defeat its military force, making it impossible to continue military resistance, then occupy its land, making it impossible to reorganize the remnants of its army and attempt a comeback, and finally eliminate its spirit of resistance, making it impossible to rise again. Only then is the victory of the war a lasting victory. However, Hitler's procedure for destroying Czechoslovakia was exactly the opposite: he first fundamentally destroyed Czechoslovakia's determination to fight, then forcibly occupied its territory, and finally resolved its army.

The Role of Propaganda
In his book "Mein Kampf," Hitler repeatedly mentioned the last World War, but his vigorous pen did not describe the tragic scenes of "millions of corpses lying and blood flowing for thousands of miles" on the battlefield, nor did he praise those brave warriors who "wore strong armor and charged into battle." In "Mein Kampf," two chapters recount the events of the last war, one titled "Wartime Propaganda" and the other "German Revolution." According to his judgment, the Allied countries' propaganda techniques at the time were far superior to those of Germany, and the disloyal minorities within Germany and the radical figures who were easily incited were the best targets for Allied propagandists and spies. Therefore, Hitler hoped to build a purely Germanic nation and hated Jews, socialists, and Catholics. In order to prevent foreign propaganda "poison" from flowing into the country, he tried his best to deceive the eyes and ears of his people. Therefore, Germans now know less and are more confused about the world situation than they were in 1918.

Three Methods
Hitler learned profound lessons from Germany's past experiences. He wanted to deal with Britain and France by "using their own methods against them." First, the external propaganda he launched was very thorough. In his speeches, there was not one that did not repeatedly state that Germany had a moral reason to restore its lost rights. Whether it was the Saar, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, or Poland, Germany's demands were based on undeniable rights. Why should a whole piece of German land be divided by the Polish Corridor? Is this fair? Is this reasonable? Are Britain and France willing to sacrifice millions of lives to maintain this unfair and unreasonable situation? Are they willing to oppose Germany? If Britain and France are willing to respect Germany's rights and resolve the issue of Danzig and the Corridor, Germany will never have any further demands. The foundation for permanent peace in Europe can be laid from now on. Why should Britain and France stubbornly resist to the end, losing big because of small things?
First, on the eve of creating any "miracle," Hitler will first mobilize a large army and flaunt his military power, while his public and private propaganda organs must do their best to exaggerate the strength of Germany's military preparations in order to subdue his enemies.
Third, Hitler is always thinking about inciting internal strife in his hypothetical enemy countries. Knowing that the domestic affairs of Britain and France are well-governed and flawless, making it difficult to succeed, he is still doing his best to encourage the autonomy movement in Alsace and the independence of Ireland. In addition, Nazi spies have penetrated into the interior of various countries, separately lobbying opposition leaders, hoping to cause political turmoil and disrupt public opinion.
Recently, Germany and Poland have started firing, why didn't Hitler want to have another Munich Agreement beforehand? As long as the likes of Chamberlain and Daladier repeat last year's mistakes, and soften their attitude, Danzig and Poland will follow in the footsteps of the Sudetenland and Czechoslovakia, and Hitler will get his wish.

The Key to War and Peace
The intrinsic value of Danzig and the Corridor is not that important. What is frightening is that at that time, Britain and France's current allies, such as Greece, Romania, and Turkey, will have no choice but to be disappointed with Britain and France and throw themselves into Hitler's arms. Finally, Britain and France will inevitably quarrel with each other and split, become isolated because of the split, and be easily defeated one by one because of the isolation. Hitler's dream of building a "Third Great German Empire" can then be realized.
The so-called secret to Hitler's victory is nothing more than this. A Corner of the Battlefield An Important Area in Southern Jiangsu Zhangzhu Yong
Starting from the continuous Tianmu Mountains, after crossing the high Tongguan Mountain, the terrain gradually becomes flat, forming a large basin. Standing on the hillside and looking down, there is a vast river that meanders from the depths of the mountains, crosses the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, emerges from the mountains, and leads north all the way to Yixing and Liyang, and even to the county towns of various counties in the south of the Yangtze River. On both banks of the river, countless houses are piled up on top of each other, right in the center of three mountains, this is the town of Zhangzhu where I stayed for two months.

A Hub of Land and Water Transportation
Holding the hub of land and water transportation, Zhangzhu was one of the largest towns in the border area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui before the war. The population was dense and commerce was prosperous, comparable to a third-class county town. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai fell, and various places south of the Yangtze River fell one after another. This only remaining piece of clean land became a gathering place for refugees. The market became more lively, restaurants and hotels flourished, the department store industry was overwhelmed, and the streets were crowded with people, presenting a deformed development. Although the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and the branch road to Guangde, which run through the town, were damaged due to the war, all import and export goods can still be transported using waterways and the original roads, so Zhangzhu still remains a distribution center for goods.

The Situation is Extremely Dangerous
Because of its backing on mountains and facing a lake (across the lake), the situation is extremely dangerous, and it is the only route from Jiangsu to southern Anhui and western Zhejiang, it occupies an extremely important position militarily. On the one hand, it holds the key to the gateway of Anhui and Zhejiang, and on the other hand, it can control Wuxi and Changzhou, threatening the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway at any time. Therefore, after capturing Yixing, the Japanese army took advantage of the momentum and went down to Zhangzhu. However, Zhangzhu's terrain was too unfavorable for them. The undulating mountains and dense bamboo gardens everywhere not only made tanks ineffective, but even airplanes could not see any targets and could not exert their power. The Japanese army was clueless when it got inside, and only stayed for nineteen days before losing their footing and retreating all the way to the north of Gehu Lake, where they finally gained a foothold. Now, from Zhangzhu to the north to the southern bank of Gehu Lake, east to Taihu Lake and west to Gaochun, this arc-shaped front line is always under the control of the Chinese army.

Interesting Stories About the Battle for Tongguan Mountain
Regarding the battle for the Tongguan Mountain position at that time, there was such an interesting story: "Because all the Chinese army's fortifications were destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, they were forced to withdraw from the position. After the Japanese army occupied the Chinese army's position, they had not had time to change the flag when three heavy bombers painted with the Rising Sun emblem flew in with a roar. The pilot saw the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun fluttering on the hilltop, and regardless of the consequences, dropped a dozen bombs in a row. Amid the collapse of mountains and the scattering of flesh and blood, hundreds of Japanese soldiers were sacrificed. In such a chaotic state, the Chinese army took the opportunity to launch a fierce counterattack. When the Japanese headquarters received accurate information, they sent two giant transport planes loaded with a large amount of food, flying to the sky above Tongguan Mountain. Bread, biscuits, cakes, and beef fell like raindrops, while those hiding in the trenches were precisely the brave Chinese soldiers!"

People's Lives are Stable
Although Zhangzhu is located on the front line, the sound of artillery fire can often be heard. Sometimes when both sides are in fierce battle, the sound of machine guns can be heard clearly. However, merchants operate as usual and farmers farm as usual, without any panic. This is because they know that the Japanese have no power to attack, so they maintain calmness in the midst of tension.
Education here does not stop because of the war. In the morning and evening, one can see many students carrying schoolbags, happily going to school and going home. The able-bodied men are also stepping up training. Every dawn, the slogans of "One, two, three—four, one" on the training ground resonate through the sky. Songs for saving the country have penetrated the people's hearts, and even the cowherds riding on the backs of cows can hum the kind of impassioned and heroic songs: "Go forward, don't retreat, life and death have reached the final stage..."
The Baojia system is organized extremely strictly, with ammunition transported to the front and wounded soldiers sent to the rear. Everything is handled in an orderly manner. In early April, all sectors jointly implemented the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week, and at the same time held a national oath-taking ceremony. Party members took oaths, and a grand torch parade was held in the evening, with more than thousands of soldiers and civilians participating. The atmosphere was tragic and enthusiastic, which is worth remembering.
The current Zhangzhu has become the center of the south of the Yangtze River, and it is also the base for the Chinese army to recover the lost territories in the southeast in the future! Worth noting Lang Piaoran writes Economic Common Sense Foreign Exchange Control Feng Kechang
Foreign exchange control refers to the intervention of a government in foreign exchange in order to adjust its international balance of payments, or the appropriate management of a country's public and private receipts and expenditures to foreign countries. Under strict foreign exchange control, all foreign currency receipts and payments by public and private institutions and individuals must be handled centrally through specific government agencies. The control method is nothing more than collecting all foreign currency income nationwide at a statutory price or by compulsory means, and stipulating that when public and private institutions or individuals need to pay foreign currency, they must be reviewed by specific agencies. Those approved will be supplied at the legal price, otherwise, they will not be supplied.

Foreign Currency Receipts and Payments
The sources of a country's foreign currency income are no more than six types: (1) the price receivable for export trade; (2) foreign currency or foreign currency securities originally held; (3) business income from overseas Chinese and shipping, and other investment income; (4) recovery of existing foreign currency deposits and other claims; (5) consumption by foreigners in the country; (6) transportation of cash, silver, etc. Under strict foreign exchange control, all of these are in the list of items to be centrally managed. As for the foreign currency that a country needs to pay, the legitimate needs are five items: (1) the price payable for import trade; (2) repayment of other existing foreign currency debts; (3) expenses for foreign officials and students and people traveling overseas; (4) remittances of foreign residents for household use; (5) foreign merchants' insurance premiums and freight, etc. Other than these, most of them belong to the category of capital flight, the so-called illegitimate needs. Furthermore, among the above-mentioned legitimate needs, there are still priorities and degrees of importance. All illegitimate needs and non-urgent foreign currency payments must be restricted under strict foreign exchange control. However, since the scope of centralizing foreign currency income and restricting foreign currency payments is so broad, it is naturally inevitable that there will be loopholes, resulting in the establishment of a foreign exchange "black market."

Purchase Restrictions
Since the implementation of the new currency policy in China, there has been a policy of unrestricted buying and selling of foreign exchange, which has not changed even at the beginning of the "August 13th" war. It was not until mid-March of last year, when the pseudo "United Reserve Bank" was established in North China and issued unprepared and non-convertible banknotes in an attempt to exchange legal currency and obtain foreign exchange, that the Chinese government believed that if restrictions were not imposed, the foreign exchange fund of the legal currency would be at risk of being eroded. Therefore, it began to implement restrictions on the purchase of foreign exchange: first, it promulgated the "Measures for Requesting Approval for Purchasing Foreign Exchange," stipulating that those who need to purchase foreign exchange must first apply according to law, and purchase it at the legal price after being approved by the Central Bank, and then gradually strengthen it, stipulating that foreign exchange will not be provided for the import of non-essential goods, and other private remittances are also subject to strict restrictions. On July 2nd of this year, it was explicitly prohibited to import non-essential goods. On July 3rd, the "Rules for Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods" were promulgated, abolishing the previously promulgated "Measures for Requesting Approval for Purchasing Foreign Exchange," stipulating that the purchase of foreign exchange must be applied for to a "Foreign Exchange Examination Committee," and those approved must be settled with the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications at the legal price, but the applicant must pay a balancing fee equal to the difference between the legal price and the exchange rate quoted by the two banks. The above measures are quite effective in adjusting the international balance of payments, but unfortunately, they can only be implemented in the inland areas, while Shanghai, which holds the financial hub of the country, cannot implement them due to its special environment.

Cracking Down on Exports
Regarding the centralization of foreign currency income, control of export foreign exchange has now been implemented. This control method began in late April of last year, when the "Measures for Merchants to Export Goods and Settle and Sell Foreign Exchange" and the "Measures for Postal Parcels to Settle and Sell Foreign Exchange" were promulgated successively, stipulating that for goods to be exported, the foreign exchange to be obtained from the sale of goods must first be settled and sold to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications at the legal price, and the transportation agency and customs can only accept and release the goods upon obtaining a foreign exchange purchase certificate and customs documents. Unfortunately, this method can only be implemented in the inland areas, and the foreign exchange obtained by Shanghai export merchants is sold on the high-priced black market. The government cannot intervene. Therefore, in Shanghai, the Chinese government in fact only has the obligation to supply foreign exchange for imports, but has no right to collect foreign exchange for exports. The only countermeasure is to reduce the amount of foreign exchange approved for imports, but this is precisely the factor that makes the Shanghai foreign exchange black market increasingly active. Due to the increasing expansion of the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, the inland export goods cannot compete with the goods directly exported from Shanghai due to the settlement of foreign exchange at the legal price. In order to encourage the export of inland native products, the Chinese government has formulated various guarantee and compensation measures for inland exporters. Recently, on July 2nd, the "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange and Receiving Exchange Rate Differences for Exported Goods" were officially promulgated, stipulating that after the exporter settles and sells foreign exchange to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications at the legal price, they can also receive the difference between the legal price and the exchange rate quoted by the settling bank based on the foreign exchange settlement certificate. The exchange rate quoted by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is slightly higher than the Shanghai black market and lower than the legal price, which is sufficient to reduce the difficulty of exporting for inland exporters. This is indeed an effective method to encourage the export of inland native products and generate foreign exchange income.

Anecdotes of Celebrities The Duke and Duchess of Windsor's Disdain for Honors
Moving to a New Mansion in Paris, A Couple Resembling Immortals
The Duke of Windsor, who sacrificed the throne for love and disdained honors, is still talked about as a beautiful story to this day. Since the Duke married Mrs. Simpson, their marriage has been harmonious and their love has been enduring. Every time the weather is good, they go on outings together, climbing mountains, playing in the water, exploring secluded places, and enjoying the scenery. Their life of leisure, their peaceful state of mind, and their spiritual joy are something that those who hold important administrative positions today cannot dream of! The Duke and Duchess are truly a couple resembling immortals. It is recently learned that the Duke and Duchess moved into their new residence in Paris in February. The address is No. 24 Sujia Road, near the River of Charity. Although it is not as grand and magnificent as the palace gardens, the Duke and Duchess regard it as no different from an immortal mansion. Furthermore, the residence is actually spacious and magnificent, and the surrounding scenery is quiet and suitable as the Duke and Duchess's residence. The residence was built in 1929 in the style of Louis XVI, with twenty living rooms and six bathrooms, all equipped with the latest facilities. In addition, there are many extra rooms, enough for the Duke's three secretaries, two private detectives, two chauffeurs, and nine other servants to live in. The residence is not the Duke's own property, but a two-year lease has been signed. The dining room of the residence was decorated in March, and the rest of the rooms were not fully decorated until June. At this time, the weather is getting hot, and the Duke and Duchess are preparing to leave here for other suitable places for summer vacation. June 19th is the Duchess's 43rd birthday, and four days later is the Duke's 45th birthday. After holding a double celebration, they will go to Aileban City. There is a hot spring there, which is said to have the effect of curing rheumatism. The Duchess is going there, perhaps to bathe in it.
The Duke of Windsor has three pet dogs, which are very intelligent, docile, and understanding, and are deeply loved by their owner. However, one of them, named "Dido," unfortunately had its leg broken by a streetcar not long ago. Although it was treated and did not die, its leg was useless and it has become disabled. The Duke and Duchess feel sorry for it every time they look at it.
On the second floor of the new residence, in addition to the kitchen and the dining room, the offices of the two detectives, Tao Satte and Ge Weir, are also located. The third floor is the Duke and Duchess's bedroom, sitting room, and the magnificent living room and banquet hall. The most eye-catching thing in the living room is the circular gold box given by his parents, with the words "To Prince Edward" on the surface. A Photo of the Duke and Duchess Recently Duke Appeals for Peace
-Writes to the Italian King as a Commoner-
Paris News: The Duke of Windsor recently wrote to King Emmanuel III of Italy in his capacity as a commoner, appealing to him to use his great power to save Europe from war and avoid the suffering of the people. The original letter read: "Your Majesty, you are the one I most admire. I was once a soldier fighting by your side. Therefore, I now appeal to you in my capacity as a commoner to use your power to turn the tide and save this imminent disaster." Health Knowledge My View of Life Ding Fubao
Because people have different circumstances and different experiences, their views on life are also different. For example, modern young people who live a life of luxury and dissipation, indulging in games and banquets all day long, are not worthy of talking about their views on life. There are also those who are busy and rushed from morning to night, with no time to spare, supporting their parents and raising their children, all of which become problems. They are confused all year round and trapped by food and clothing, and they are also not worthy of talking about their views on life. There are also those who have enough food and clothing, do nothing with no purpose, without honor or disgrace, and spend their lives in vain. When a coffin is attached to them, everything is over. Such people are also not worthy of talking about their views on life. There are also those who take accumulating wealth as their view of life. When they are alive, they often accumulate wealth to millions or billions, but after their death, their children and grandchildren suspect each other, and their families collapse from within and without. In a few years, they will be gone with the wind. This is the mistake of taking accumulating wealth as a view of life. There is also a kind of official obsessed who takes being an official as the first profession in life, flattering and pleasing in every possible way, and damaging their personality. There is also a kind of gluttonous person who takes the desire of the mouth as the first enjoyment in life. As a result, they often suffer from high blood pressure, nephritis, hardening of the blood vessels, premature aging, and other diseases. These people are all making mistakes in their views on life.
I will briefly describe the most true and noble view of life of the Buddhist school: First, treat all living beings equally and do not have any ideas of poverty, wealth, nobility, lowliness, injustice, kinship, highness, or inferiority in your heart. Second, I have received this body in order to save all living beings, so I should devote myself to saving society throughout my life, exhausting myself and dying. Third, do not expect any reward from all the living beings who have been saved. These three points are what the Buddhist school calls developing Bodhicitta. Zhang Zixi Ming said: "People are my compatriots, and things are my companions." He also said: "All the disabled, sick, lonely, and widowed in the world are my brothers and sisters who are suffering and have no one to tell." This is also the same meaning. Proceed according to this purpose and do not give up halfway, which is an active view of life. A passive view of life is not enough to talk about this. Happy and Contented Nurturing of Character for Longevity Ding Huikang
One Must Seek Spiritual Pleasure and Satisfaction
Perfect happiness, a healthy physique, and a long life are what everyone hopes for, and spiritual peace, pleasure, and satisfaction are the important foundations for achieving these three. The general public's psychology is that spiritual peace, pleasure, and satisfaction are greatly related to their personal environment, but this is not entirely true. Often, people who have plenty of food and clothing cannot obtain as much satisfaction and comfort as those who have only simple meals and drinks. This kind of peaceful, pleasant, and satisfying spirit does not originate from the creation of the environment, but can be obtained by paying attention to it in our own minds and bodies. I will briefly describe it as follows:
(1) Be able to restrain one's emotions and always maintain a peaceful mood, so that one will not tend to extremes.
(2) Usually, have a possible goal in mind and do not make extravagant hopes to disturb the peaceful spirit.
(3) Live each day as if this day is the only purpose and concentrate on it. The achievements of the future are based on this.
(4) Always have thoughts of universal love and mutual assistance in your heart. Whether people love or hate me, never disturb my heart.
(5) Life has the happiness of family, the joy of making friends, the fascination with nature, and the appreciation of music and books, all of which can generate pleasant emotions. These pleasant emotions are the elements of spiritual peace, life, and health, and we should seek them ourselves.
Engaging in a noble spiritual career, such as reading books, practicing calligraphy, and studying interesting sciences, can all enable the body and mind to have something to rely on, and often feel the unique pleasure in it, so as to delight the spirit. Torture Lang Piaoran writes Strange News and Events Husbands Can Also Be Bought and Sold
In today's male society, the buying and selling of wives is not a rare thing. But sometimes it is the other way around, and husbands can also be bought and sold.
In some places in southern India, the number of women far exceeds the number of men, so men have become valuable commodities. A woman who wants to buy a bridegroom with a good family background must pay at least 500 to 1,000 rupees. If the bridegroom is of outstanding character, the price is surprisingly high - sometimes it costs the bride as much as 10,000 rupees! Nowadays, women in these places are also becoming increasingly Westernized, so men who have received Western education are more likely to find employers, and the price can also be raised. It is said that a bachelor's degree from a university studying in England is worth 1,000 rupees, and if he obtains a doctorate, it can be increased to 2,000 rupees.
Not only in the East can husbands be bought and sold, but also in the West, there are many such strange things. Not long ago, an Irishman in New York posted an advertisement for sale at a price of 300 pounds, seeking female customers. It is said that his original wife, suffering from homesickness, wanted to return to Ireland alone. He could not raise the travel expenses for his wife, so he had to sell himself!
There is also an American youth who came up with a unique marriage proposal plan. He wanted to issue sixty lottery tickets, each selling for 50 US dollars. Any girl or widow under the age of 32 could purchase them. The winning woman could not only get a young man as her husband, but also get 3,000 US dollars in cash from the sale of lottery tickets.

Mr. Cai Yuanpei is a highly respected veteran educator and the sole leader of the academic world. Everyone respects Mr. Cai. Mr. Cai's wife, Ms. Zhou Jun, is virtuous, capable, gentle, and can be said to be a typical new woman. Here, it is worth introducing Mrs. Cai's education: She studied at the Shanghai Patriotic Girls' School, the Zhenjiang Chengzhi Girls' School, and the Qiming Girls' School in her early years. After graduating, she served as a teacher at the Shenzhou Girls' School and the Anqing Provincial Women's Normal School, and also served as a private tutor at Zhang Jusheng's home, serving education for more than ten years. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, she went to Europe with Mr. Cai for their honeymoon. First, she went to Belgium and entered the National Academy of Fine Arts, and then went to the Paris Academy of Fine Arts. She also studied Western painting under a famous painter. She had loved art since she was a child, and with the guidance of famous teachers, her skills improved greatly. Finally, she went to the University of Hamburg in Germany to specialize in "Ethnology." After returning to China, she took charge of household affairs and no longer took up teaching positions. She said that it was not that she did not want to serve, but that household affairs were too complicated to take care of.
Mrs. Cai has three key opinions on women's issues: First, improve their knowledge; second, get rid of extravagance; and third, be diligent and endure hardship. She said that although these three points seem to be old sayings, they are actually unbreakable truths. A woman must first have knowledge, and can be competent for any opportunity. Otherwise, even if she wants to fight for equal rights with men and improve her position, it will be in vain. For example, Sweden once had a woman who was the Minister of Education, and France has also had three female cabinet members in recent years. One of them that I know is the daughter of Madam Curie. They are all women with extensive academic knowledge, which is why they have been able to achieve outstanding positions. It is definitely not something that can be hoped for by chance. Loving luxury and admiring vanity are the most common faults of women, especially those who grow up in cities. They are influenced by fame and fortune and find it most difficult to get rid of the habit of frivolity. You must know that frivolity and vanity are not good things. Since ancient times, in urban society, countless evils have occurred and numerous tragedies have been caused because of them! I hope that female compatriots will be strong in will and not fall into a deep pit. As for diligence, it is a virtue of mankind. On a small scale, it can reduce the burden on men and increase the happiness of the family; on a large scale, it can be beneficial to the general public in society and contribute to national construction. I think rural women are the most able to work. Taking Suzhou Tianping Mountain as an example, women engage in embroidery or push carts during the slack season. A portion of men carry birdcages and go to tea houses, being well-fed and doing nothing. That kind of situation is not exceptional. In rural areas everywhere, men and women probably work equally.
Having seen the blockbuster "One Night of Passion," everyone praised the briskness of the technique, the extreme relaxation of the mood, and the skill of the style. The blockbuster "Midnight Passion" from Paramount has the same effect. The starring characters are all famous stars. The female lead, Claudette Colbert, has gained a large audience on the screen for her playful and charming acting skills. The male lead is Don Ameche, who starred in "The Chicago Fire" and "Musical Moments from Chopint." John Barrymore and Mary Astor occupy important supporting roles. Barrymore's new wife, Elaine Barrie, also makes her first appearance in this comedy. The whole performance is full of humor. A new style of dance is also introduced, called "HaConga," which evolved from a Cuban folk dance. The tune is very hot and will definitely be popular in dance halls in the future. The above is the theme song of "Midnight Passion," which has a beautiful and very pleasant melody. Mr. Wang Qinglong of the China Harmonica Association has compiled the harmonica notation. The date of the film's release and the theater will be announced in the entertainment section of this newspaper at that time. Science and Life New Medical Discoveries Using Microscopes to Identify Diseases
The French Academy of Medicine in Paris recently announced that regarding the technique of medical diagnosis, Swiss famous chemist Dr. Pan Pfeifer has been conducting continuous research, and now there is a new discovery of great value. According to the new method proposed by Dr. Pan, take a drop of blood from the patient's finger and add copper chloride to turn it into a crystalline form. If it is an ordinary healthy person, the shape of this crystalline blood under the microscope is always parallel lines. As for the patient's blood, its shape varies depending on the disease. For example, the crystalline blood of tuberculosis is in the shape of a "Malta" hollow cross, tumor disease is in the shape of a right angle, epilepsy is in the shape of a fan, and diabetes is slightly spherical. It has been tested thousands of times and is accurate. Therefore, using this method to explore the patient's symptoms can be as clear as one's palm.

### Robber Cup International Doubles: China Gains Final Spot; Straight Sets Victory Over Britain Yesterday; Japan Defeats US, Also Gains Final Spot

As a result of yesterday's semi-finals in the Robber Cup International Tennis Doubles Tournament, the Chinese and Japanese teams secured their places in the final, which will be held next week to determine the champion. China eliminated Britain in straight sets, while Japan also defeated the United States in straight sets. The scores are as follows:

The China-Britain match was completely one-sided, lasting only forty minutes. The difference in strength was vast, and Bond was unable to resist at all. Lin Shihua's wonderful shots came one after another. Bennawi was old and not as good as before. In the last game, Lin Shu won four "aces." After the game, because the Japanese players had not arrived, the four players performed another set, which Wang Lin won 6-2. Based on today's performance, there is no doubt that China will be the champion. Japan and the United States continued to fight. Japan's victory was completely unexpected. The Japanese players concentrated their attacks on Squia, who made numerous mistakes, resulting in a miserable defeat. Naizhi was better than Chai Ne in steadiness and could be relied upon, attacking entirely with low, sliced balls, preventing Cash from volleying. The overhead smash was also excellent, but Chai Ne made many mistakes and will not be a match for the Chinese team. In the first set, the US took the lead at 5-4, but Japan won 7-5. In the second set, the US took the lead at 6-5 but lost three consecutive games to Japan. In the third set, the US trailed 1-5 and chased back three consecutive games, but ultimately failed.
