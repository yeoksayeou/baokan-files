(Hong Kong) Generals in the Western Guangdong region have been holding military conferences for days, resolving to enhance defensive strength and maintain close communication with the Chinese troops in Northern Guangdong.

Sihui: Around 10:00 AM on the 5th, over 200 Japanese soldiers from Sanshui, aboard six motorboats, attempted to land at the old Sanshui Hialekong, covered by artillery fire from the Japanese forces in Mupin. The Chinese defenders calmly defended, waiting until the Japanese boats approached within one hundred meters before unleashing a dense barrage of machine-gun fire. Under the control of the fierce Chinese firepower, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and were unable to advance, being forced to retreat to Wankingsha in a very disorganized state.

One Week's Overview of the War Situation - Report by Chen Cheng -

(Chongqing) Chen Cheng's report on the overview of the war situation in one week is as follows (from December 26th to January 1st):

Guangdong Area

Since the Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack in Guangdong, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army, the Japanese army planned to shorten the defense line and reorganized to wait for reinforcements. It also actively constructed fortifications in the areas of Tsangshing, Huangpu, Shunte, Jiujiang, Fatshan, and Sanshui on the outskirts of Guangzhou, as a plan for retreat and attack. In recent days, the Japanese troops in Tsangshing and Upper and Lower Lo Kong have been attacked by strike forces of a certain unit of the Chinese army, causing great panic. They fired artillery all night, consuming a large amount of ammunition. The Japanese troops in Shilong were attacked by a strike force of a certain unit of the Chinese army on the night of the 28th, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese troops for several hours, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. At dawn, the Chinese army safely withdrew to its original position. A unit of 1,000 Japanese troops from Fatshan was transferred away, and a regiment transferred back from Jiujiang filled the gap, seemingly as a change of defense and adjustment. The First Division of the Japanese army in Sanshui seems to be actively preparing, and it is rumored that there are follow-up troops in transit. It has a very active intention towards the West River. No active movements have been seen from the Japanese warships in the Beihai and Qiongyai waters.

Northern Section of the Yuehan Railway and Southern Jiangxi Area

The war on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway has been quite quiet in recent days. The Chinese and Japanese armies are still facing off on the line of the Sin Wang River and Kowloon Street. A certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Taolin in Linshong on the night of the 1st, killing many Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese fled north in a disorganized manner. In the Southern Jiangxi area, the Japanese and Chinese armies are still facing off on the south bank of the Xiu River. Apart from small skirmishes between the guerrillas and the Japanese army from time to time, there have been no fierce battles on the front lines. At dawn on New Year's Day, the Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness and launched fierce attacks on the Japanese troops at various key points between Yunghsiu and Tanan, killing many Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in disarray, and the Chinese army is sending troops to pursue them.

Hubei-Henan Area

After being wiped out by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops in Yingshan, Taolin River, and Kwan Ho Pu in northern Hubei all retreated to Chit Ho. The Japanese troops at Kuantimiao also retreated to Yingshan. After a certain team of the Chinese army attacked Anlu, they captured Ching Lung Tam. The Japanese troops retreated towards Yen Tun Tien. The Japanese troops in Cho Shi, numbering two thousand, are on high alert and in a state of extreme fear. In Southern Henan, there has been no fighting recently. However, the Japanese troops in eastern Henan have been quite active recently. The Japanese army near Shangchiu and Kaifeng has recently increased to five to six thousand. A unit of several hundred soldiers invaded Chi County and is currently engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese garrison. Although Tung Shu has been occupied by the Japanese, it does not dare to invade westward due to the containment by the Chinese guerrillas. In Northern Henan, the headquarters of the Japanese army in Sinhsiang was attacked by Chinese plainclothes teams and caught fire, burning for days. The Luli Wang Fu Railway Station north of Sinhsiang was attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese could not resist and collapsed northward.

Shanxi-Suiyuan Area

The Japanese army in Shanxi has recently planned to actively besiege the Chinese army in western Shanxi in preparation for crossing the river and invading westward. Since the beginning of the second ten days of December, they have invaded in multiple directions. One route of the Japanese army invading north from Hotchin was severely attacked by the Chinese army near Yumen Mountain and has already fled back towards Hotchin. One route of the Japanese army invading west from Linfen joined forces with the Japanese army invading south from Fenyang on the 29th and fled to Ta Ning. A unit harassed Chi County and Hsiang Ning and is currently engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army. One route of the Japanese army invading south from Fenyang via Chiu Yu was intercepted by the Chinese army and was unable to succeed. One route of the Japanese army invading west from Lishi was ambushed by the Chinese army near Liu Chuang, and a unit has already fled east. Other units are still planning to invade westward. The Chinese army is dividing its forces to drive them out. In general, the area between Chi County and Hsiang Ning is the predetermined battlefield for the Chinese army and has been carefully arranged. It is expected that the Japanese army in that area will soon suffer a major blow. The Japanese army in the Suiyuan and Baotou areas has continued to increase, seemingly with the intention of invading westward. Fearing guerrilla attacks, they have recently demolished all the civilian houses within thirty miles around Baotou City. Homeless refugees have flocked to join the guerrillas, posing a major threat to the Japanese army. At the same time, the puppet troops in the area are fighting among themselves. The more powerful units are brewing mutiny.

The report that the Japanese army in Baotou is reinforcing to a large extent and will launch a westward invasion is completely untrue.

Hebei Area

There are many Japanese troops stationed at key points on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. There are over 10,000 Japanese troops near Shihchiachuang. A unit of over 7,000 has gradually moved westward, seemingly to reinforce Shanxi.

In summary, there have been no particularly major battles on any front this week. In Southern China, the Japanese army in Guangdong seems to be holding fast to key points near Guangzhou and strongholds such as Humen and Tungkun. The main force invaded Chaoching from Sanshui, but the Chinese army launched simultaneous attacks on all fronts, preventing the Japanese army from taking care of both ends and suffering heavy losses, forcing them to retreat to their original positions. In Central China, there have only been small skirmishes. The Japanese army seems to be concentrating its forces in Wuhan for reorganization, and the Chinese army is waiting for an opportunity to attack. In Northern China, the Japanese army in Shanxi and Suiyuan has been very restless and has invaded various areas in western Shanxi in multiple directions. However, they have suffered heavy losses after being severely attacked by the Chinese army and are still fighting in Hotchin, Chia An, and Lishi. The Chinese army's defenses are tight and its forces are strong. The Japanese want to break through and cross the river to invade westward, but the Chinese are determined to inflict heavy losses on them. Now, the second phase of the War of Resistance has begun. The Japanese army has penetrated deep into the mountains, which is actually beneficial to China. In terms of political and military strategy, the Japanese have become exhausted and stretched thin. The Chinese should take advantage of new strategies and tactics to achieve a comprehensive strike against the Japanese, forcing them to lose their footing and breaking them individually and collapsing them entirely, in order to achieve final victory.

### Report that Wang Ching-wei is Hiding in Hong Kong; Another Report Says He is Under Surveillance in Hanoi; Chen Yu-jen Will Make a Formal Statement

(Hong Kong) It has now been learned that Ching-wei is hiding in Hong Kong. Someone saw him at a certain Japanese person's residence on Conaught Road, rumored to be sending out a radiant telegram. This is the result of Chen Pi-chun's insistence. Ko Mou is acting on his behalf to liaise with the Japanese side and is working hard to facilitate this. (Special dispatch from 1:00 AM on the 6th)

(Hong Kong) There is a rumor that Chen Yu-jen will resume his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Chen said that it is difficult to comment on the radiant telegram for the time being and that he may make a formal statement in the future. As for his views on the current situation, he will submit a telegram to the Central Government for revision before issuing it. (Special dispatch from the 5th)

Hanoi: The story that Wang Ching-wei, former Vice-President of the Kuomintang, flew from Hanoi to Hong Kong yesterday has been denied by French officials here. Wang lives alone in the suburbs of Hanoi. The French authorities are keeping the location a secret. After arriving in Hanoi from Kunming on December 21st, he immediately entered the hospital. Later, at the request of the local French authorities, he was discharged from the hospital and moved to a villa in the suburbs, where he is guarded by guards and close confidants, and refuses to meet any guests. (Fast News Agency dispatch from the 5th)

Hanoi: According to French sources, Wang Ching-wei is still residing somewhere here and has not gone elsewhere. The rumor that he flew to Hong Kong the day before yesterday has now been denied by the French authorities. Wang is in fact still hiding somewhere near Hanoi, but only French people know the location. The staff of the Chinese Consulate General in Hanoi have stated that after Wang sent out the peace-seeking telegram and was expelled from the party by the Central Government, they have severed all relations with Wang and are closely monitoring Wang and his associates' actions. It is also reported that they have received orders from the Central Government in Chongqing to keep Wang under surveillance. (Fast News Agency dispatch from the 5th)

Hanoi, according to this place "Future Report" published, Wang Ching-wei's coming to Hanoi, was on December 21, directly from Kunming. After arriving in Hanoi, at 1 p.m. that afternoon, he entered a certain hospital to live. However, the highest authority in Annam came out to interfere, and advised and made him leave the hospital to move elsewhere. Wang then hid in a certain Chinese friend's place in Hanoi, and has been staying there since then. Wang Ching-wei's residence is now surrounded by Jing Wei, in addition to his close friends, no visitors are received. It is rumored that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui had come to Hanoi to persuade Wang to rein in at the precipice, but Wang also refused to meet him. Wang himself is invisible, but reporters have met several of his confidants. According to them, Wang's exodus is not just a personal act, but is accompanied by several friends, of which there are six who are the most noted. In addition, it is also said that Chen Lifu came to Hanoi, which is difficult to verify. According to Chen, who is one of the leaders of the right wing of the Kuomintang, his coming to Hanoi is actually to persuade Wang to repent, or to express sympathy to Wang, which is also impossible to explore. (Fast News Agency dispatch from the 5th)

(Chongqing) Reuters reporter learned today that Guo Taiqi is an old friend of Wang Ching-wei, so he sent a telegram to Wang, pointing out that the peace proposals made by the CCP were wrong and strongly urging him to retract them. According to usually well-informed sources, Wang is currently residing somewhere about sixty miles from Hanoi. Li Tsung-jen, Liu Wen-hui, and public organizations in Yunnan and Hunan have issued declarations, severely criticizing Wang. According to sources in Hong Kong's Chinese community, Hong Kong newspaper vendors are refraining from selling the South China Daily because it is run by Wang Ching-wei. (Reuters dispatch from the 5th)

(Hong Kong) Hong Kong English South China Morning Post published an article on the 4th entitled "Wang Ching-wei's Failure", refuting Wang's fallacies in detail. It recognized that Wang's proposition cannot prevent China from losing territory and sovereignty. Wang's views have never been firm and consistent. This time he has been severely criticized, which shows that the people have lost faith in Wang. In the end, it said that this move is actually to encourage traitors to sell out the motherland and promote international distrust of China. Fortunately, he has been abandoned by the whole country, and the international community has also judged his failure. (Dispatch from the 4th)

Loyang: There are less than 20,000 Japanese troops in Northern Honan, mostly the troops from the Iseki unit of the 14th Division, concentrated in the areas of Huojia, Poai, and Fenyang in the western section of the Taoching Railway, attempting to threaten Chengchow, Hahn County, and Loyang. The Japanese troops along the Chin Han Railway north of Hsi Yu and the western section of the Taoching Railway are taking a conservative policy towards the military situation in Northern Honan. Therefore, strong fortresses have been built in various strongholds to defend against attacks by the Chinese army. Several teams composed of infantry, cavalry, and artillery have been formed to conduct guerrilla warfare. It is expected that the Japanese army will be unable to invade westward at this time. (Dispatch from the 4th)

### Wang Tsan-hsu Flew to Chungking Today to Report and Request Instructions

(Chengtu) Wang Tsan-hsu is scheduled to fly to Chungking on the afternoon of the 6th. On the 5th, he told a Central News Agency reporter that he was going to Chungking to report and request instructions. In the future, the Sichuan political facilities would be managed in accordance with the orders and instructions of the Central Government. Outside of the central government's political orders, he personally had no political views. Outside of the central government's laws and regulations, he personally had no guidelines. He said he had limited talent and strength, and that Sichuan's responsibility was extremely important. Whether Sichuan could be managed well depended on the degree to which the central government's laws and regulations were followed. Therefore, he said he was going to Chongqing to visit the highest leader and relevant officials, one to report on the current situation in Sichuan, and the other to request instructions on the future policy of governing Sichuan. He added that the request for instructions was more important than the report, because political facilities were complex, and how to make Sichuan bear the heavy responsibility of the War of Resistance depended on the leader's detailed instructions. He said that he would only follow the instructions and do them faithfully, and had nothing else to say. (Dispatch from the 5th)

### Japanese Troops in Southern Shansi Failed to Invade Westward

Hsingchi: Last month, the Japanese troops on the Tungpu Railway crossed the Fen River and invaded westward. Because the Chinese army ambushed them on both sides of the railway, the Japanese troops changed to defensive and waited for reinforcements to raise the issue. By the end of the month, the heavy snow in western Shansi had just stopped, and the Japanese troops were gradually assembled, 6,000 to 7,000 in Fenyang, 3,000 in Hungtung Chaoching, 6,000 in Linfen, and over 2,000 in Chu Hou Hsinchiang. They launched a large-scale westward invasion on the 25th. The first route was based on Fenyang, passing through Tui Jiu Yu and going north to Mai Chiao and Shi Kou, and then north to Shihlou and south to Sshih County. Japanese troops have been found west of Xin Guan, crossing the Yangtze River. The second route was based on Linfen, passed through Tung Hsi Lu Chu, Sun Chu, Sshih Men, and Hei Lung Kwan, and attacked Pu County, Ta Ning, Nien Kou, Hung Liang Kou, and Nan Wan Li. There were fierce battles. The third route started with the Xiangling, advanced westward to Yu Kuo, occupied the Kuo Chia Zhuang, and then went north to the Chinese army's attack. After being welcomed by the Chinese army, they fled to the north and launched a bloody battle west of Chen Tou and south of Yao Yeh. The Japanese army joined the Japanese army at the junction of Chin Yu Ling and Hei Lung Kwan. In this battle, the Chinese army Wei Ming-hsiao, the head of the High Ling Han Ying battalion, was killed, and Chao Te-kui, the deputy head of the regiment, was wounded. The fourth route of Chu Wo Hsinchiang Japanese army occupied Chin Zhang San Chuan Chao Kang and other places. A certain regiment of the Chinese army went south from Yu Kou and a certain division went north from Chi Wang Mountain, attacking from the north and south, and the Japanese army hesitated to advance. The Chinese army, Yuan San-tao Ying battalion commander, was killed. The fifth route was based on Hotchin, passing through Fan Tsu, Ku Chen, Hsi Wei Kou, Hsi Po Chen, and Mao Tzu Ching, and advanced north. The main force attacked Yumen in the west. Subsequently, the Chinese army recovered Yumen, and the Japanese army stole to Shih Chia Tan, and took Nanny Miao in the east, harassing the villagers' County Kilns. They split the army from the Kiln and attacked the Chinese army at the Small Boat Den crossing. It was found that the Japanese army was determined to invade west, headed by the 118th Division, Taniguchi Motoro's department. This division was mostly composed of elderly and weak people, and suffered the greatest losses at Hengling Pass and Heng Shui in Chiang County, Southern Shansi. The entire 115th Regiment was annihilated by the Chinese army's Peng Division in Wang Tsai Chen. In total, the entire division lost more than two-thirds. The former division commander Shimo Ryotaro and brigade commander Nakano were dismissed due to the defeat in the Hoshii Park battle. In this resolution battle, in addition to the new recruits, more puppet troops of Wang Ying and Zhang Renjie were also equipped. They captured Heilungguan and the Zhuang in the villages of Ta Ning and Chuan in northwest of the township. The Japanese army's rear was cut off, and the two sides were often hit. After being defeated at Small Boat Den, he attempted to find another crossing point at Ping Tu Guan or Xin Guan Kou, but was also afraid that he would not be able to do so. (Dispatch from the 4th)

Editorial

### Recent Developments in the Sino-Japanese Problem

Yesterday, airplanes suddenly appeared over the Shanghai International Settlement, scattering leaflets. It is said that the leaflets were written in obscure Chinese, mainly claiming that some Chinese ambassadors abroad had telegraphed the National Government, hoping to cede the Northeast to Japan as a condition for peace. The leaflet stated that this was due to the fear of mutual destruction, which would only benefit Soviet Russia. Ambassadors stationed abroad are responsible for implementing national policies and negotiating diplomatically, and it is not their place to overstep their authority and discuss national policies. Since the unification of China, both the provincial officials within the country and the diplomatic personnel abroad have been able to abide by their duties, and there have been no more instances of jointly telegraphing opinions on national affairs. Therefore, the claims in the leaflets are fundamentally untrue. Furthermore, judging from the tone of the leaflets regarding war and peace and the writing style, it is safe to say that the leaflets must have been written by the Japanese. At that time, the people who picked up scraps of paper happily ran around telling each other, "Japan is so clever!" We don't need to analyze the Japanese mentality based on the leaflets, nor do we need to take the leaflets as strong evidence that "Japan is so clever." However, what we must know is that in the past two weeks, the Sino-Japanese problem has been entering a new phase, and people in China and abroad should pay attention to its evolution. For example, on December 22, former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement. It not only made it clear that Japan would not give up its ambition to dominate East Asia and destroy China, but also used diplomatic rhetoric to lure various countries in the hope of trapping them in their schemes. On December 26, Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek expressed his determination to resist aggression, defend the country, and strive for national independence and freedom. Governments and people in Europe and the United States unanimously condemned Japan and praised China for these declarations from China and Japan. On December 31, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan even responded to Konoe with a protest. On the 4th of this month, the Konoe cabinet collapsed, and the ultra-right-wing Hiranuma organized a new cabinet. On the same day, U.S. President Roosevelt fiercely criticized aggressor nations in Congress and planned punitive measures; Britain, France, and other countries readily agreed. All these important developments will have a significant impact on the future of the Sino-Japanese problem. However, the pro-Japanese Wang Jingwei's advocacy of surrender and yesterday's leaflets encouraging peace talks are guerrilla tactics employed by the Japanese side in the late stage of its aggression against China and amidst the dynamic international situation.

Using Wang Jingwei as a guerrilla tactic earned Japan the criticism of the world as a "damp firecracker." Using leaflets as a guerrilla tactic earned Japan the citizen's exclamation "Japan is so clever!" It is predicted that after these two events, there will probably be other measures to use the idea of peace talks to shake China's determination to resist and to ease the international community's righteous words. Japan's military operations in China and its international diplomacy are on the verge of collapse, which is an obvious fact. The unsustainability of its domestic finances can be proven by the blatant implementation of the National Mobilization Law. It is important to know that the content of the Mobilization Law enacted by Japan after the outbreak of the war of aggression against China will make the property rights of capitalists and the human rights of the people almost completely equal to zero. The full implementation of the Mobilization Law is virtually no different from a revolutionary action by its warlords against capitalists and the people. Konoe was not strong enough to overcome this, so he started with the ultra-right-wing Hiranuma to preside over national affairs, control the Mobilization Law, cut flesh to mend sores, and wielded the knife to cut. If Japan's finances had not fallen into a desperate situation, it would never have implemented this extraordinary decree. Only when its military, diplomacy, and finances were all in dire straits did it resort to all kinds of desperate measures to escape death. When its tricks were exhausted, Wang Jingwei and the leaflets appeared one after another.

From July 7, 1937, to this day, it has been exactly eighteen months. The casualties and sacrifices of the Chinese military and civilians during the war of resistance can be said to be unprecedented in history. Who doesn't have a family? Who doesn't have a livelihood? Who isn't heartbroken? Who enjoys the sound of gunfire? Therefore, at this time of thousands of difficulties, a word about ending the war and a thought about peace and welfare are most likely to make people's hearts flutter. However, with Konoe's statement, Wang Jingwei's telegram, and the airplane leaflets coming one after another, the Chinese government and people have been able to avoid being tempted by them. Japan's plan to destroy the country and people is completely exposed. Even if they use the bait of peace and welfare, who would covet it? Even if they set up a trap of peace and welfare, who would fall into it? The Chinese side only takes Japan's cessation of aggression and withdrawal of its troops eastward as a prerequisite for ending the war, and is so loyal and forgiving as to be unable to yield any further. The sorrow of serious sacrifices and the determination to defend the country and survive cannot be taken away. What's more, there is Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who is in charge of military and political affairs, who recently instructed the military and civilians on the way to fight and the reasons for victory. Below, there are generals and soldiers who have experienced hundreds of battles and have the spirit to swallow the enemy, who are unyielding and make persistent efforts. Internally, there are people who share the same hatred for the enemy, sacrificing their current lives and property for the sake of future generations. Externally, there are friendly countries that provide assistance with weapons and funds, and have consistently sympathized with China and are close to gradually strengthening their sanctions against aggression. Comparing this with those whose military, diplomacy, finance, and economy are all in dire straits, who cannot continue to endure the pain for some time until the end of victory, and who would be willing to give up at the last minute, compromise and surrender, and move towards eternal destruction?

Fuzhou. Yesterday, two Japanese warships sailing from Taiwan to the Xiayang sea area in Huian County, southern Fujian, fired at the Chinese coast, shelling more than 60 rounds. After a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army, the warships retreated and anchored more than ten miles from the Xiayang sea area. Three Japanese warships also arrived outside Jinjiang estuary yesterday, but there have been no unusual movements yet. (5th dispatch)

### Yoshiko Kawashima: Suffered Ax Wounds; The Deceased Was Her Younger Sister

(Hong Kong) It was previously reported that Yoshiko Kawashima was assassinated and died. It is now known that Yoshiko Kawashima was indeed ambushed in Tianjin on New Year's Eve and suffered several ax wounds, and her condition is critical. The person assassinated at the same time as Kawashima was her younger sister, who died from gunshot wounds. The assassin did not recognize Kawashima, so he focused on the one dressed as a woman, her sister, who died at the time. Although it is rumored that Kawashima escaped, she was actually wounded by an axe. (5th dispatch)

(Tokyo) Today's "Nichinichi Shimbun" reported that, according to a previous report from the Chinese side, Yoshiko Kawashima was assassinated in Tianjin. This news is not true. However, Yoshiko Kawashima was beaten and seriously injured. According to reports, Yoshiko Kawashima went to a hospital in the French Concession of Tianjin to visit a Mrs. Wang and was beaten. Mrs. Wang was killed with an axe on Saturday. (5th dispatch, United Press)

### The Puppet Organization in Ping Attempting to Undermine the Legal Tender

(Peiping) The "Provisional Government" Ministry of Finance here recently announced that, starting from February 20, when the legal tender still circulating in North China is exchanged for the currency of the United Reserve Bank, a further discount of 30% will be applied. At this point, the legal tender has been devalued by a total of 40%. The effect of this new order is uncertain, because although a devaluation of 10% was officially announced last summer, those with legal tender amounting to 2,000 yuan still received a premium of 4%.

### British Worries Growing as Trade in China is Deprived; Commercial Advisor Responds to Mr. Nie's Remarks; Hoping the Government Will Give China Greater Assistance

(London) Yesterday, both The Times and The Daily Telegraph published articles that further prove that British merchants are increasingly worried about the Japanese infringement of foreign trade and rights in China. Mr. Lee, Chairman of the Cotton Cloth Dyeing Association and a member of the Commercial Advisor Committee, published a letter in The Times yesterday, strongly supporting the remarks made by Mr. Nie Gerson, Director of the China Group of the London Chamber of Commerce, in The Times on December 21 last year. Mr. Nie's article stated, "The public's attention to British interests in China is far greater than what it currently receives." It also stated, "Those engaged in trade with China all believe that the ultimate goal of the Japanese is to eliminate all Western forces and enterprises in the Far East," and condemned the British government's long-term policy of tolerance in China, saying that Britain actually allowed its largest market to be gradually eliminated by Japan to become a Japanese-dominated trade area, which is astonishing. If the British government does not act to strengthen this policy beyond mere diplomatic protests that encourage the Japanese to despise it and invite ridicule from continental countries, it is tantamount to telling British merchants that destruction is inevitable because Britain's prestige has gradually declined. Mr. Lee solemnly announced that the total amount of British investment in China is 300 million pounds, and compared the decline in British and American exports to China in 1938 with the increase in Japanese exports, and also pointed out the situation in Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo," saying that since the Japanese occupied "Manchukuo," British trade there has accounted for only 1% of its total. If Japanese aggression is not curbed, this situation will also occur in China. We can only pay for the huge burden of reorganizing armaments and social services if we can increase, or at least maintain, our export trade. As for China, it has vast possibilities, great trade talents, and a desire for peace, and we should give it greater assistance than it currently receives." Mr. Gilling also published an article in The Daily Telegraph, analyzing in detail the resources of the Sino-Japanese-"Manchurian" economic alliance, warning people not to lightly speculate on the collapse of Japanese finances and economy, and solemnly declaring that among the countries in the world in which Britain has invested money, China ranks as the largest, except for Argentina. Therefore, if Japan can overcome its current financial difficulties and establish a Far East economic alliance, the one that will bear the brunt and sacrifice the most will be Britain. (5th dispatch, Reuters)

(London) The Financial News published a lengthy article today, anonymously authored, stating that the news that the Japanese government is moving further along the path of fascism is not a good sign for the future of British commercial interests in China. The article detailed the losses suffered by British trade in the Far East since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, saying that from this situation and the generally unsatisfactory attitude of the Japanese military authorities, it is clear that Japan will never be satisfied until it has completely monopolized Chinese trade and resources, eliminated all other interests, and forever destroyed the Open Door Policy. If Japan wins, it will inevitably establish an effective puppet government in the manner of the three northeastern provinces. At that time, what can be hoped for is that this new government will evolve into a "Manchukuo" II. For the sake of British interests, Britain must prevent this outcome at any cost. If Britain waits until Japan has completely reached a deadly position, a major Anglo-Japanese conflict will be inevitable. Giving China economic assistance by relaxing credit to China can ultimately be as effective as directly declaring war on Japan, and the cost is far less than directly declaring war on Japan. If things are still worth doing, the British government may prohibit the export of large quantities of war materials and other necessary supplies currently being shipped to Japan, and prohibit the import of various items from Japan.

### Polish Foreign Minister Visits Hitler to Discuss Eastern European Issues

Berchtesgaden. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck arrived here this morning from Nice, France, and immediately paid a visit to Führer Hitler to hold talks. (5th dispatch, Havas)

Warsaw. Polish Foreign Minister Beck has traveled from southern France to Munich, Germany, to hold talks with Führer Hitler. Given the current situation in Europe, its political importance cannot be ignored. The issues that should be discussed by both parties must include the issue of the Free City of Danzig. It is heard that the German side will request Poland to allow it to build a highway through the Polish Corridor to connect the German province of Pomerania with East Prussia. Although the Polish newspapers have not mentioned this, the Polish government may not explicitly oppose it. The issues of German minorities and Ukrainians will also be discussed. It is heard that Foreign Minister Beck will inquire with Führer Hitler to find out his true intentions and assess the situation, and propose guarantees to Führer Hitler, or request guarantees from him. How the relations between Germany and Poland will evolve in the future will depend on the outcome of this conversation. The general international situation will also be discussed by both parties.

### British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Return to Capital Early to Prepare Fully Before Visiting Rome

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax suddenly returned to London yesterday, which was quite unexpected. The two were originally scheduled to return to the capital at the end of the year. However, political observers believe that the sudden return of the two prime ministers to London is of great importance, and believe that this trip was agreed upon by the two prime ministers. Chamberlain recently told reporters that he would have ample opportunity to exchange views with Halifax before going to Rome. Therefore, political figures believe that the early return of the two prime ministers to the capital is to discuss the attitude of the United States towards the issues of Spain and the Mediterranean, in preparation for the Rome talks.

### Britain Actively Implements Warship Construction Program

(London) The London "Evening Standard" reported that the British Navy will increase the construction of 100 ships of various types in 1939, including multiple 10,000-ton cruisers. On the other hand, some of the large ships already under construction will not be completed until next year. In addition to the construction of 35,000-ton battleships, the following ships are also under construction: five aircraft carriers, two of which can be completed this year; twenty-two cruisers, including three of 10,000 tons, which can be put into service this year; twenty-three destroyers, of which thirty will also be completed this year; and fifteen submarines, of which thirteen will be completed soon. Other ships, such as three auxiliary ships, four minesweepers, three gasoline tankers, one submarine supply ship, two river gunboats, and thirty-four small ships, will all be put into naval service this year. However, seven new cruisers will not be completed until 1940. The report went on to say that of the five 35,000-ton battleships currently under construction, two will be built next year, and the remaining three will be completed in 1941. Two more battleships have been approved for construction but have not yet started construction. It is said that the displacement will be 40,000 tons. The newspaper estimates that there are currently 150 British naval ships under construction. (5th dispatch, Haitong)

### Roosevelt's Message to Congress Criticizes Dictatorial Countries; The United States is Determined to Uphold Democracy and International Integrity and is Willing to Consult with Other Countries to Prevent Aggression; Advocates for Amending the Current Neutrality Law

(Washington) President Roosevelt personally read his message to Congress today, which lasted forty minutes before finishing, interrupted by applause. The applause was especially loud when he advocated amending the current neutrality law and the federal government's continued expenditure of huge sums of money. When he spoke about upholding the democratic system, the entire audience applauded unanimously. When the speech ended, the people in the audience shouted their approval. Almost the entire diplomatic corps was present to listen, including the German chargé d'affaires, Thompson. When President Roosevelt criticized the dictatorship and declared his unwavering adherence to democratic principles, Thompson remained expressionless. (4th dispatch, Havas)

(Washington) President Roosevelt recently delivered a message to a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives at one o'clock this afternoon, stating: "Peace has not yet been established. Military or economic wars are now taking place around the United States, threatening the three things that Americans do not lack: first, religion; second, democratic system; and third, international integrity. The latter two are derived from religion. All three are mutually reinforcing and indispensable, and should be jointly maintained. "Any social order that refuses to accept these three things cannot accept the Christian ideal. This kind of social order should be rejected by the United States, and it should maintain its inherent faith. There are now people advocating a new philosophy that only respects power. If this philosophy controls other continents and invades the American continent, we Americans will know what kind of situation we will suffer. Therefore, the enemies of our faith and humanitarian values should not be allowed to surround our country. This is no different from other countries not wanting to be surrounded by their enemies." It is gratifying that the American republics have the same ideals and can live in peace and respect each other. This peace and this ideal should be maintained first.

However, this does not mean that the American countries are confronting other countries in the world. On the contrary, we should still maintain our traditional proposition and be willing to discuss with other countries ways to prevent aggression and arms competition, as well as ways to revive international commerce. Today, the world is extremely small, and various offensive weapons are extremely fast. If one nation or one country refuses to resolve various disputes through negotiation, other countries cannot guarantee peace. Furthermore, if a government possesses huge armaments and only promotes a policy of power, other countries, in order to protect their security, have no other way to follow except to maintain defensive armaments. In addition, new-style warfare is faster and broader in scope than in the past, so we should make preparations for defense in advance. Before launching military operations, each aggressor country uses preliminary aggression, or conducts propaganda, or uses money to bribe, or destroys the connections of good people, or incites various prejudices, or encourages infighting, in various forms.

In each democratic country, those who believe in God, abide by various treaties, and treat other countries with sincerity should not turn a blind eye to violations of justice, no matter where they occur. When a sister country is invaded and affects us, it is not appropriate to stand idly by without effectively protesting... Although we avoid using force to stop aggression, we do not act as if aggression did not happen. There are other ways to put pressure on aggressor countries besides war. At a minimum, any action, even passive inaction, that helps aggressor countries or strengthens their power should be avoided like filth. The implementation of the current neutrality law may be unequal, unfair, and even favor aggressor countries and be thin to countries that are aggressed upon. This kind of situation, considering the human instinct for survival, should not be allowed to remain unchanged for a long time. Then, President Roosevelt defined the general national defense policy, saying, "We must first maintain sufficient military power so that once an enemy suddenly attacks various strategic locations, we can repel them and maintain the strength to resist until the final victory. In addition, defense equipment must also be strengthened to meet all needs and not be broken by the enemy.

Regarding the issue of armaments, a message will be submitted to Congress within the day. It is hoped that the people of the country will unite to strengthen national defense. The second part of the message was used to discuss domestic issues, stating that the current government has formulated a comprehensive plan to preserve national resources, relieve the poor, resolve labor-capital disputes, enrich the credit system, and encourage various research projects. All of these have been achieved without resorting to dictatorial powers, such as forced labor, restrictions on funds, the establishment of concentration camps, hindering freedom of speech, and violating various rights stipulated in the Declaration of Human Rights. All of these means have not been adopted. Although, there is a need to reorganize the administrative structure, and the Social Security Act and the Law on Adjusting the Mutual Relations between Labor and Capital need to be improved so that both capital and labor can be closer to each other. Although the dictatorial countries have solved the problems of unemployment and the use of idle funds, they use force to solve them. The United States should adopt other methods that do not violate current principles and the Declaration of Human Rights to compete.

President Roosevelt then described the achievements of recent years, and said that the unity of the American people and the sense of responsibility have improved compared to 1929 or 1932. The policy of spending huge sums of money by the federal government is also fully justified. The total amount of public and private debts in the United States has not increased from 1929 to today, and interest rates have been reduced. The pain felt by the people is that capital has not been fully utilized and should be remedied. The total annual income of the people should now be increased to US$80,000,000,000. If so, "the number of unemployed can be reduced, and the various revenues and expenditures of the federal government can be offset." It is very dangerous for the government to suddenly save various expenditures. On the contrary, if the policy of spending huge sums of money is fully maintained, the total annual income of the people will not be difficult to recover to US$80,000,000,000, the original number.

The answer is that the price required by the dictatorship is too great and is by no means what the American people are willing to pay. Not only the spiritual values, such as the sacred freedom of speech and freedom of belief, have ceased to exist, but all our funds will also be confiscated, and our children will not be able to receive education as free and self-respecting human beings, but will become tools thrown by machines. In short, in order to maintain the freedom to survive, it is worth sacrificing and we do not need to resort to dictatorship. (5th dispatch, Havas)

### Biddulph Addresses Public, Endorses President's Policy, Two Paths to Deal with Defaulting Nations, Believes Economic Sanctions Necessary

(Washington) Following President Roosevelt's address to Congress today, Senator Biddulph, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement, saying that the policy of resisting aggressor nations advocated by the President should be supported by Congress. "We now have two paths to follow. One is that for any government that has signed a peace treaty with our country, if there is any infringement of the rights of our government and citizens, we will only lodge protests to resolve the matter. The second is that in addition to lodging protests, we will impose spiritual, commercial, and financial sanctions to make these protests more effective. The issue lies in choosing one of these two paths. I believe that our government has already chosen the second path. Furthermore, since the implementation of the current Neutrality Act, the results it has caused are actually contrary to what was expected, which is a real situation." (Havas, 4th)

(Washington) It is believed here today that President Roosevelt's address to Congress is a return to the tough stance of 1937. Congressional sources pointed out that the President made a bold and indignant attack on dictators, and openly stated that he would retaliate economically against general aggressor nations. The President also asked Congress to amend the current Neutrality Act so as to at least in all aspects, end the possibility of the United States legally providing convenience to aggressor nations. What deserves our attention most is that President Roosevelt's address to Congress was not only directed to Congress as a whole, but to the entire country and the world. Therefore, immediately after the President read it to Congress, it was broadcast to the whole world in four languages: French, Italian, German, and Spanish. Authorities believe that the President's address is the foundation of the national defense plan. From the President's intention, he not only wants to protect the rights of the United States in the Western Hemisphere, but also cares about aggression events all over the world. Therefore, based on this point, and viewing the President's opposition to authoritarian countries, the United States may attempt to impose economic sanctions on Japan in the Far East, although Japan's aggression is currently not related to foreign aggression in the Western Hemisphere. Government leaders are awaiting public reaction to the President's address tonight, and anticipate that the support gained for the President's firm stance will be even stronger than the Chicago speech in 1937. According to the results of the United States' experience in Asia and South Africa in the past 18 months, a sharp change has taken place in general public opinion in the United States. As for the actual methods of how to sanction aggressor nations, officials are unwilling to disclose them, and a major plan has not yet been determined. However, it is said that the President and his aides have completed research on various methods within the scope of current laws, and they can be put into practice as soon as an order is issued. At the same time, in order to increase the effectiveness of this method, the President advocates major revisions to the main points of the Neutrality Act. The President strongly opposes the policy of isolationists, claiming that "America will never allow beliefs that are hostile to us to surround us." (Associated Press, 4th)

### England and France Welcome, Germany and Italy Indignant

(London) All evening newspapers yesterday published special editions, which is clear evidence of London's close attention to President Roosevelt's speech. Officials have not yet commented on the speech, but political commentators have expressed their opinions, saying that the US President's speech can be expected to encourage all the people of European democracies. The Star stated that the speech was very frank. (Reuters, 5th)

(London) Britain today expressed a warm welcome to President Roosevelt's hard-line stance against aggression. In particular, it showed great interest in three key points in President Roosevelt's address, namely: (1) Amending the Neutrality Act so that aggressor nations do not take advantage; (2) Democratic countries do not need war to strike aggressors; (3) Reaffirming the US proposal to consult with major powers to stop aggression, limit armaments, and revive commerce. (Associated Press, 5th)

(London) When US President Roosevelt advocated amending the current Neutrality Act in his address to Congress today, diplomatic and political figures here were deeply impressed, saying that President Roosevelt's move is a further guide to American public opinion, so that it can understand that all countries with the same ideals must establish a common defense line. It is still unknown whether the Neutrality Act amendment will be submitted immediately. In addition, President Roosevelt also denounced the dictatorships in his address, with words as severe as those in the speech given by US Secretary of the Interior Ickes on the 18th of last month. (Havas, 4th)

(Paris) President Roosevelt's address to Congress today has been unanimously praised by French political figures, who said that it is a practical warning to the dictatorships. The section criticizing the current Neutrality Act is a comment on the European situation, and it is the first time that it has been explained that countries neighboring aggressor nations are in great danger. This view has always been held in France, which shows that the viewpoints of the United States and France are becoming closer. As far as the safety of the United States is concerned, if the various demands made by Germany on the colonial issue are satisfied, then the naval bases that the country can set up in its future colonial territories will not be far from the US territory, which is not in the interest of the United States. President Roosevelt has now advocated taking various measures to prevent this threat, which is commendable. In short, the tone of President Roosevelt's address today is firm, exactly the same as the note sent by the US government to Japan on December 30 last year, which is welcome. (Havas, 4th)

(Berlin) People here generally expressed appreciation for the US President's brave and frank speech. However, the Fascist side was deeply resentful of the United States' hard-line attitude towards attacking the aggression of authoritarian countries. Therefore, official newspapers are now preparing to attack the President in their commentaries. (Associated Press, 5th)

(Berlin) Political commentators commented on President Roosevelt's speech, saying that its wording was more cautious than his recent speeches, hoping that President Roosevelt's speech would have a positive impact on the public declarations made by those who cooperate with President Roosevelt in the future. However, they strongly opposed President Roosevelt's criticism of the situation in Germany. A political commentator told a Reuters reporter that Roosevelt's remarks showed that he lacked knowledge. Roosevelt's mention of the threats to civil religion and international faith cannot be said of Germany. We are now at peace with Britain and France, and we do not want to attack the sister countries of the United States. This is all fantasy, saying that we are trying to disturb the peace of democratic countries, which is absolutely impossible. We do not want to eliminate any other doctrines except Bolshevism, and we do not want to threaten religion. The Jewish question is not a religious question. (Reuters, 5th)

(Rome) After US President Roosevelt read his address to Congress today, Italian political figures were deeply impressed, saying that the policy promoted by the United States will increasingly be unfavorable to the dictatorships, which is worrying. The relationship between the United States and Italy was not very good, and it may become worse in the future. (Havas, 4th)

### US Budget Proposal Submitted to Congress by the President

(Washington) President Roosevelt has prepared the budget for this year and submitted next year's budget to Congress today. When submitting this year's revised budget and next year's budget, the President said that by the end of 1940, the national expenditure deficit had reached $4,458,000,000. According to the 1940 budget, total expenditures were $8,995,663,000 and revenue was $5,669,320,000, so there was a total shortage of $3,326,343,000. The President said that according to the above budget, revenue increased by $194,000,000 compared with last year, because national business conditions are expected to improve next year. Of the expenditures, $2,266,000,000 is for relief and reconstruction work. The budget for this year (up to June 30 this year) has been revised because revenue is less than originally budgeted due to poor business conditions. According to the original budget, expenditures were $9,492,329,000 and revenue was $5,520,070,000, with a shortage of $3,972,259,000. Revenue decreased by $399,000,000 compared with January last year, and also decreased compared with revenue in 1939, because business conditions were poor in the last few months of 1937 and the first few months of 1938. Estimated income tax will decrease by $548,000,000,000,000, a decrease compared to 1938. Expenditures include $3,187,000,000 for full-year relief, an increase of $951,000,000 compared to last year. At the same time, national defense expenditures have also increased to $53,000,000. According to his estimate, by June 30, national debt will reach $41,131,000,000. The President also said that some government financial institutions, such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Export-Import Bank, whether they are profitable or loss-making, will be published in the budget. (Associated Press, 5th)

### French Prime Minister Daladier Inspects North African Defenses and Holds Grand Military Parade, One Battalion of Indigenous Soldiers Increased to East Africa

Port of Gabès, Tunisia. Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier, accompanied by Tunisian Governor-General Labonne, and the Army and Air Force Chiefs of Staff, inspected the "Maginot Line" defense line in Tunisia today. Afterwards, he held a military parade in the small village of Antouniel. A total of 20,000 indigenous troops participated in the review, all equipped with the latest weapons, including mechanized units. After the review, the Prime Minister had lunch with the officers, and after the meal, he met with the leaders of various Arab tribes and newspaper reporters, expressing his gratitude for the Tunisian residents' loyalty to France. He then drove to the desert area near the border of Tunisia and Italian Libya to inspect the garrison, and returned here at 8:15 pm. At that time, the entire city was brightly lit, and the streets were crowded with people. Many people gathered near the hotel where Daladier was staying, cheering and paying tribute, vying to catch a glimpse of his style. Daladier immediately came out to the balcony to express his thanks and read the congratulatory message issued by President Lebrun, which stated, "The people of France are united in their loyalty to the motherland, which has been demonstrated by your Excellency's trip." Upon hearing this, the crowd burst into applause and shouted "Long live France," "Long live Lebrun," and "Long live Daladier" before dispersing. At this point, Prime Minister Daladier made a radio broadcast speech, saying that he was deeply gratified by the enthusiastic welcome from the people everywhere on this trip. The indigenous leaders said at the military parade today that if France needs anything in the future, they will always be ready to be driven, which is commendable. (Havas, 4th)

Port of Marseille. A battalion of Senegalese indigenous infantry from French West Africa, originally stationed in southern France, has been ordered to depart for the Port of Djibouti in French East Africa on the 6th of this month to strengthen defense. The garrison in the Port of Djibouti originally had only one battalion. However, because Italy coveted the French Somaliland in East Africa, one battalion has been dispatched there. Now another battalion has been sent, making a total of three battalions. (Havas, 4th)

### Governor of the Bank of England Norman Arrives in Germany

(London) Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, arrived in Berlin at 8:30 this morning to attend the baptism of the grandson of Dr. Schacht, Governor of the German Central Bank. According to well-informed sources, Norman will take the opportunity to discuss the issue of Jewish emigration with Schacht in order to establish a compromise plan. (Havas, 5th)

### Japanese Warlords Realize Dictatorship, Hiranuma Kiichirō Forms New Cabinet, Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministers Retained, Konoe Serves as Minister Without Portfolio, Took Office in Palace Yesterday, Declared Resolution to Implement Previous Cabinet's Policy, Chinese Unity Strengthens, Not Afraid of Any Pressure

(Tokyo) After being ordered to form a cabinet, Hiranuma Kiichirō presented the list of cabinet members to the Emperor this afternoon, and the Emperor immediately accepted it. The new cabinet then took the oath of office. The new cabinet is a "National Concentration Cabinet" and is supported by members of the Japanese Fascist Party. The cabinet members of the Konoe Cabinet, except for Konoe himself who serves as President of the Privy Council and still joins the cabinet meetings, Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro, Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa, Justice Minister Shiono Suehiko, and Education Minister Araki Sadao are all retained. The new Finance Minister is Ishiwata Sotaro, who is the former Director-General of the Ministry of Finance. The new Interior Minister is Kido Kōichi, who was the former Minister of Health and Welfare. The new Minister of Commerce is Hatta Yoshiaki, who was the former Minister of Colonial Affairs. In addition, Seiyukai leader Maeda Yonezō serves as Minister of Railways. (Haitong, 5th)

(Tokyo) The investiture ceremony of the new cabinet members was held in the palace at 7:30 this evening. Afterwards, Hiranuma convened a short cabinet meeting and then issued a declaration, stating that he would continue the policy of the previous cabinet and implement the consistent policy on the China Incident adopted at the Imperial Conference in early December last year. (Reuters, 5th)

(Tokyo) It is said that before agreeing to remain in office, Army Minister Itagaki consulted with the leaders of the military and told Hiranuma that the military hoped that the cabinet could absolutely adhere to its policy towards China announced on December 22, in order to achieve the final goal based on the resolute and decisive policy adopted at the Imperial Conference. It is heard that Itagaki also expressed the military's views on the national defense and rearmament procedures required to cope with the East Asian crisis, and the military's various hopes for further strengthening the anti-communist power of the three countries, strengthening the national general mobilization system, expanding national production capacity, promoting national spirit, and encouraging overseas trade. (Reuters, 5th)

(Tokyo) Today, diplomatic circles said that on the surface, the Hiranuma Cabinet is weaker than the Konoe Cabinet, but the dismissal of Interior Minister Suetsugu has improved Japan's domestic relations. The new cabinet's policy towards China will continue Konoe's doctrine, but will adopt a more moderate policy towards domestic affairs. They pointed out that Hiranuma used to have Fascist tendencies, but has now transformed into a more moderate figure. (Associated Press, 5th)

(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared yesterday that the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet indicates that the government's policy is becoming more and more radical. The new Prime Minister Hiranuma Kiichirō will adhere to the anti-communist policy and step up military action in an attempt to end the war in a short period of time. The spokesman solemnly stated that China is fully prepared to deal with any consequences of the new developments in the Japanese government. (Haitong, 5th)

(Chongqing) Chinese newspapers attach great importance to the news of the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet. The Japanese new cabinet is more likely to cooperate with the radical faction. Ta Kung Pao believes that the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet can be said to be a failure of Japanese liberalism and the establishment of a warlord dictatorship. As for China's attitude, Chinese newspapers unanimously stated that China is prepared to resist Japanese oppression. After the Chinese government broke away from those with weak wills and ulterior motives, the unity is becoming stronger, and the situation has not changed. Even if the Japanese increase pressure, there is nothing to worry about. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has received telegrams from military and civilian agencies and individuals, stating their sincere support and determination to resist Japan to the end, and requesting that strict measures be taken to maintain discipline, eliminate those with wavering wills, and boost morale. (Haitong, 5th)

(London) Chinese in London told a Reuters reporter, "It doesn't matter to us who is in power in Tokyo. We will fight as before, but a more extreme Japanese government may be beneficial to us because it will accelerate the opportunity for the Japanese people to revolt." (Reuters, 5th)

### List of New Cabinet Members

(Tokyo) After being ordered to form a cabinet yesterday evening, Hiranuma only got a few hours of sleep after an all-night meeting, and has completed his work today. All the important cabinet members of the previous cabinet, except for Finance Minister Ikeda who resigned and was promoted by Director-General Ishiwata, have retained their original positions. In the new cabinet, Seiyukai leader Maeda serves as Minister of Railways, and the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry had been obtained by Machida's comrade from the Minseitō, but Machida declined, so Sakurauchi, an advisor to the Minseitō, was appointed instead.

The list of new cabinet members is as follows:

Prime Minister Hiranuma Kiichirō

Minister without Portfolio Konoe Fumimaro

Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro (retained)

Interior Minister Kido Kōichi

Finance Minister Ishiwata Sotaro

Army Minister Itagaki Seishiro (retained)

Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa (retained)

(Tokyo) Today, Hiranuma and Konoe had a meeting, and they completely agreed on the policy of continuing the war against China of the previous cabinet. After the meeting, Konoe told visiting reporters that he and Hiranuma freely and frankly exchanged views. Japanese newspapers all say that the new cabinet is actually a joint cabinet of Hiranuma and Konoe, or a continuation of the Konoe Cabinet. All cabinet members are dispersed, with eight of them retained and two promoted by former cabinet directors. Konoe has been appointed as Privy Councilor, and as expected, he will attend important cabinet meetings as a minister without portfolio. The new Minister of Railways Maeda served as Minister of Railways in the Hirota Cabinet in 1936 and Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Inukai Tsuyoshi Cabinet in 1931. Now he represents the Seiyukai in the cabinet. The new Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Sakurauchi, is known as the brain of the Minseitō and served as Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Wakan Cabinet in 1931. Now he represents the Minseitō in the cabinet. As for the new Finance Minister Ishiwata, he was in the same class as Konoe in middle school. After graduating from the Imperial University Law School in 1916, he joined the Ministry of Finance and served as Director-General for the past two years. (Reuters, 5th)

### Under the Leadership of Chairman Chiang, China's Determination to Resist Japan is Resolute, Signs of Internal Turmoil in Japan Have Been Seen, Ambassador Guo Delivers Speech in London

(London) Chinese Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi said in a speech at the London National Trade Union Club yesterday that the Chinese people's determination to fight to the end in order to achieve a fair and lasting peace has been strengthened. The whole country supports the leadership of Chairman Chiang. Japan's peace terms are a fraudulent attempt to make China an appendage. If Japan does not change its policy towards China, China has no other way but to continue the war of resistance. At present, Japan has discovered signs of internal turmoil, and China has shown no signs of weakness, so there is no possibility of surrender. (Reuters, 5th)

### Embassy in Paris Issues Statement Clarifying Rumors

(Paris) The Chinese Embassy issued a statement today, stating that "The rumors in Shanghai that the Chinese Ambassador to France or the Embassy telegraphed General Chiang Kai-shek or the National Government, requesting that they accept the peace proposal put forward by the former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe on December 22 last year, are not true. The Chinese nation, under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, has the determination to achieve final victory, which is well known in the theoretical circles. It is hoped that they will not be deceived by false propaganda." (Havas, 5th)

### British and French Observations on the Japanese Political Situation, The New Cabinet's Life May Not Be Sustainable

(London) All evening newspapers published the news of the resignation of the Japanese cabinet in large characters, with headlines such as "Fascism Defeats Japanese Prime Minister." The Japanese in London deeply regretted Konoe's resignation, saying that while he was in office, he was still able to balance the forces of all parties and resist the worst demands of the extreme military elements, especially after the occupation of Hankou and Guangzhou by the Japanese. Konoe was disappointed by the failure of his proposed peace terms with China, because he had great hopes for them, so this matter was probably the final reason for his resignation. It is said that the new Prime Minister Hiranuma belongs to the radical nationalist faction and is an extremist. He is not popular in Japan. The retirement of the former Finance Minister Ikeda is regrettable, because everyone recognizes him as the most capable candidate for Finance Minister. The Japanese in London are very worried about who will succeed as Finance Minister. According to predictions here, the two major political parties in Japan, the Seiyukai and the Minseitō, will fight hard against the military's plan to organize a new political party in the Fascist manner, just like in the springs and autumns of 1936 and 1937. If the above plan is realized, it will in fact make the parliament useless. If the two major parties make this struggle, they may win the support of the Japanese people. According to precise observers, the new cabinet may not be permanent. (Reuters, 5th)

(Paris) After the resignation of the Konoe Cabinet, French newspapers have commented that this is a major victory for the extremist faction of the Japanese military, and the tense relations between the United States and Japan will definitely become more and more serious. Among them, the far-right small newspaper Daily News stated that the Japanese military wants to carry out a full-scale war and does not allow the establishment of a compromise plan. The United States, in order to protect international law and safeguard its own interests, will inevitably be forced to fight Japan. The great competition between the Anglo-Saxon group and the group of omnipotent countries has begun. The Radical Socialist Republican News stated, "The United States' tougher attitude towards Japan is enough to add significant assistance to China. The Japanese military's extremist faction may immediately accept this provocation, which is not necessarily true. However, Japan's military strength and resources are becoming increasingly scarce, and public opinion is becoming increasingly uneasy, which must also be taken into consideration." The Stone Sect's Liberal News stated, "After the current war continues for some time, I am afraid there will be no end to it, which Japan is deeply afraid of and eager to end." "On the contrary, the determination of China's Military Commission Chairman General Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese people to resist is becoming increasingly firm." The Communist Party's Humanist News stated that the Hiranuma Cabinet is a "transitional cabinet" and is responsible for continuing to promote the policies of the former Prime Minister Konoe. How long this cabinet can last is difficult to predict. What is known is that the length of its life will be determined by the attitude of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States towards the German, Italian, and Japanese groups. (Havas, 5th)

(Moscow) Regarding the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, responsible persons here believe that it is a victory for the Fascist faction. The Soviet Russian official TASS news agency pointed out that Konoe's resignation was due to the pressure of the military, because the military faction blamed Konoe for Japan's failure to destroy General Chiang Kai-shek. (Haitong, 5th)

### American Figures Offer Comments; Economic Sanctions Against Japan – The Time Is Ripe

(Washington) Following the resignation of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet and the appointment of Privy Council President Hiranuma Kiichirō to form a new cabinet, responsible figures in the United States have offered comments, generally stating that he represents the Japanese Fascist faction and that his succession as prime minister is intended to form a cabinet necessary for continuing the war and territorial expansion. Now is the time when the application of economic sanctions against that country would be most effective. Regarding the interests held by the United States in China, Japan has already adopted various discriminatory measures and cut off traffic between Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and the Chinese interior, effectively bringing Sino-American commerce to a standstill. The U.S. government may summon Ambassador Grew back to the country to report, so that the means of implementing the policy advocated by President Roosevelt in his message, namely, to deal with aggressive countries with strong measures, can be discussed. This is not beyond possibility. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Berlin Watches Cabinet Change in Japan; Believes End of War Is Deceptive

(Berlin) Germany is paying close attention to both the resignation of the Japanese cabinet and the organization of the new cabinet, and expresses the opinion that this cabinet change will increase the strength of Japanese foreign policy. At the same time, the German officialdom has no comment on this matter, pending the completion of the new cabinet. The Berliner Tageblatt writes that "Konoe's resignation seems to clarify the comments made by various Japanese newspapers at the end of last year, namely, '2939 [1939] will be the year for unifying diplomatic policy and integrating the three aspects of naval, land, and diplomatic policies.'" Examining the history of the Konoe Cabinet, it can be seen that its first requirement for unifying foreign policy has not yet been fulfilled. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

(Berlin) Following the general resignation of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet, Privy Council President Hiranuma Kiichirō has been ordered to form a new cabinet. German political figures are commenting extensively, generally stating that Hiranuma is known as the "father of Japanese Fascism." Regarding the war between China and Japan, although Japan holds a military advantage, the peace overtures from Wang Jingwei have been unanimously rejected by the Chinese side, so the end of the war is virtually nowhere in sight. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### US Denies Recalling Ambassador to Japan; Grew's Return This Spring Is Routine Leave

(Washington) Today, the State Department denied that the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, has been recalled. The State Department stated that the government has approved Grew's request for leave to return to the United States this spring, and that Grew's return is not a recall, nor does it have the significance of returning for consultations. However, it is natural that Grew will meet with U.S. State Department officials upon his return. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)

### Japanese Ambassador to Germany Arrives in Italy to Meet Shiratori

San Remo, Italy – Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, arrived here yesterday and held important talks with the country's Ambassador to Italy, Toshio Shiratori. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

### Japan-Soviet Fisheries Negotiations Continue; No Progress Seen

(Moscow) Regarding the fishery agreement issue, an official of the Japanese embassy stated that negotiations are continuing to some extent, but there is no prospect of a conclusion in the short term. Furthermore, regarding the labor dispute at the Japanese oil company on Northern Sakhalin, the current talks have also shown no progress. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

### Observations Along the Guangdong-Guangxi Roads After the Fall of Guangzhou (Part Two); Refugees Overcrowded, Many Killed and Injured; Cities and Towns Bombed

South of the river, there are two routes that refugees must take to evacuate (as there were no boats, only land routes available). One is from Shek Wai Tong along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway to Sanshui, and the other is from Fangcun via Zhao Village and Pingzhou to Chancun. Therefore, those fleeing can take either route if they can cross the river. After the reporter arrived in Fangcun, it was said that the Shek Wai Tong route was extremely congested. Generally, the fleeing masses all said that Shek Wai Tong had trains for transportation. Even if the trains were too crowded, they could walk along the railway. Therefore, there were particularly many refugees on this route. Trains ran all night, departing every two hours, but they could not carry everyone. The number of people walking along the railway was uncountable. The reporter thought that the Guangzhou-Sanshui trains were often bombed by planes, which would inevitably cause delays and danger along the way. Also, there were so many refugees that even with trains, weak individuals like myself could not compete for a ride. Therefore, I changed course and headed west. In the early morning of the 21st, I left Fangcun on foot, taking the route through Zhao Village and Pingzhou to Chancun. Unexpectedly, there were also tens of thousands of refugees on this route, all aiming for Chancun as a temporary destination. The fifty-odd li from Fangcun to Chancun (under the jurisdiction of Shunde) had village defense corps stationed along the way to protect and guide the route. The ferry crossings did not demand extra fees, and the order was fairly good. Halfway, we heard loud explosions from Guangzhou. At noon, three Japanese planes flew over and dropped several bombs on the new market of Chancun's Bijiang estuary, destroying the Huian tile kiln. They also dropped several bombs on the Lintou Station (connecting to the Daliang highway), killing and injuring five or six people. It is said that this was the first time Japanese planes bombed Chancun. As a result, the local people panicked. Chen and the provincial capital are only forty or fifty li apart. If traveling by ship, it would take only two hours to arrive. Now that the provincial capital had fallen, Chancun naturally could not be considered safe. At that time, there were two refugee camps in the market, but they could not accommodate the large number of people. Vacant ancestral halls and street corners were filled with refugees, shivering and exposed to the elements, in a very miserable state. After nightfall, we could hear the sound of cannons and bombs from Guangzhou all night long. On the morning of the 22nd, hundreds of policemen from the Guangzhou Police Department fled to Chancun. More than a hundred officials from various administrative organs also came here to take refuge or transferred to Daliang. It is said that on the morning of the 21st, there were no more soldiers or police maintaining order in Guangzhou. The city was in chaos, and traitors and local thugs took the opportunity to steal and set fires. Until the night of the 22nd, the fire had not yet been extinguished. Looking north from Chancun, the sky was all red. That morning, the police station in the market ordered all ships anchored on the river to sail to the Sanshui estuary for concentration to prevent them from being used by the Japanese. The population in the market was also ordered to evacuate, and all business in the market came to a standstill.

In the early morning of the 23rd, the reporter left Chancun and headed west, planning to stay at Guanshan Market in Xiqiao. Guanshan is sixty-odd li from Chancun. Along the way, we passed through Lecong in Shunde and Jili in Nanhai before reaching Guanshan. At noon, we passed through Lecong. The highway bridge next to the market (the Jiang-Fo Highway) had been blown up automatically the day before (the 22nd). According to a township head in the market, all eleven iron bridges on the Jiang-Fo Highway were ordered to be blown up on the 22nd. The vehicles on the road that had not been transferred had also been completely dismantled, with the wheels and important parts scattered and parked in various villages. Therefore, traffic on the road was completely stopped. However, the people of Lecong were still calm as usual, and the stores were operating as usual. Due to the increase in the refugee population, business was twice as lively. Most people did not yet know that Guangzhou had fallen. In the tea houses and restaurants, those who talked about Guangzhou being lost were mostly incredulous. They all believed that the Guangdong army's resistance was particularly strong, and the defensive fortifications had been in place for more than a year. Even if the Japanese army attacked fiercely, they would be able to resist desperately and hold out for a month or two, not fall so easily. But their ideals and reality were completely opposite. By the time we reached Jili, the situation in the market was the same as in Lecong. When we arrived at Guanshan, the sun was already setting, and the sky was approaching dusk. About twenty or more small electric boats and tugboats were docked on the Guanshan River, most of which were requisitioned by the authorities and awaiting dispatch. Most of the staff of the Nanhai County Government and the county party headquarters had moved to the market. Merchants and residents from the provincial capital, Foshan, Chancun, and Lanshi had also fled here. For a time, the population of Guanshan increased sharply, and business was also abnormally prosperous. Although the market is under the jurisdiction of Nanhai, it is located in the western corner, and its location is at the foot of Xiqiao Mountain, so the traffic is not important. Therefore, for more than a year of the war of resistance, Japanese planes have not come here to harass. Those who took refuge regarded it as a safe haven. Unexpectedly, on the 24th, Japanese planes bombed, and the losses were incalculable. (To be continued)

### The Story of Cheng Wanjun's Defection to the Japanese from the Dahu Guerrilla Force; Cheng's Troops Are Now Stationed on the Lakeside, Committing All Kinds of Evil

Suzhou Correspondence: Since the National Army retreated west the year before last, the people's resistance forces have been secretly organized and active in the villages of various places. The Taihu Lake area has also become a base for the people's armed forces. Originally, the Taihu Lake area is a water town, relying on the complexity of the crisscrossing rivers and the lush growth of aquatic plants, making it difficult for the enemy's shallow-water warships to operate. The muddy and narrow land routes are not suitable for the use of cannons and tanks. At first, there was the Southeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, whose leader was Cheng Wanjun. Cheng was originally a low-ranking officer of a certain division and was stationed in Kunshan. In November of the year before last, he retreated to Taihu Lake, met with local patriots, contacted troops from various routes, strengthened the organization, and worked hard to establish the Volunteer Army. In January of last year, the army's headquarters was stationed in Nanku. After a brief encounter with the Japanese army, they retreated to Dongshan. Because the members of the troops were complex and mostly corrupt, they did not gain the trust of the people. The local wealthy people reported to Gong Guoliang, the head of the Suzhou puppet water police brigade, and planned an encirclement. Therefore, Xi Guoliang, together with more than 1,000 Japanese troops, advanced by land and water on the morning of January 15th, and carried out bombing with airplanes. At this time, Cheng Wanjun led his troops through three days and nights of resistance, and withdrew from Dongshan on January 18th, causing the troops to scatter and hide in the lakeside area. Generally, the scum took the opportunity to make excessive demands on the people, making it difficult for them to bear. The most loyal and brave in Cheng's troops was Tian Wenlong, the commander of the Beitaihu garrison. After the Dongshan battle, Tian's troops retreated to Xishan. The Japanese army continued to pursue and attack Xishan. After three days and nights of resistance, due to lack of food, they retreated to Majishan in West Taihu Lake to build up their strength. In March, Tian Wenlong was discovered by the Japanese for destroying bridges and obstructing Japanese traffic. The Japanese sent a team to attack Majishan. Tian Wenlong took the lead and fought fiercely for four days and nights, killing more than 500 Japanese soldiers. More than 300 members of Tian's troops made heroic sacrifices. Tian was also slightly injured. On March 16, he withdrew from Majishan and led his troops to Hulou on the lakeside to heal his wounds.

After the Majishan battle, Cheng Wanjun stationed his headquarters in Lujia Port. After half a month of reorganization, he still restored his previous strength. At this time, he had troops from Tian Wenlong, Sun Ziqing, Cao Chunqing, Zeng Hong, Wang Qingshun, and others, totaling more than 4,000 people. However, there were many corrupt and ill-behaved officers and soldiers among them, even openly committing bandit-like evil deeds. The political leader of Cheng's troops was Jin Luwang. Jin was a frustrated politician who indulged in mahjong all day long and neglected political training. He only knew how to satisfy his personal life and used perfunctory and scheming means to deceive the youth. In June, Jin organized a political training office and appointed himself as the director, but before the arrangements were completed, he established a "Tax Bureau," which included more than ten kinds of taxes, such as special tax, slaughter tax, cigarette business tax, liquor tax, miscellaneous tax, salt tax, tooth tax, and boat tax. The tax rate was so high that it was practically disregarding the law of the land. The lakeside area, from Hengjing in the east to Daqian in the west, could collect an estimated seven or eight thousand yuan per month. In addition to these donations, the people were also required to bear monthly donations, household donations, and local maintenance donations, which were collected by a certain Ye of the Economic Council. It was estimated that eight or nine thousand yuan could be collected per month from the townships. Not satisfied with maintaining 17,000 to 18,000 yuan, the troops stationed in the villages also required the people to bear the cost of meals.

In August, the Japanese troops in Nanxun and Zhenze secretly retreated east because the Jiashan guerrillas attacked the city. Cheng's troops under Sun Ziqing arrived in Zhenze first, and Gan Qingshun's troops also arrived in Zhenze the next day. Tian Wenlong arrived in Nanxun first. At first, the people in the two towns hung up the national flag to express their welcome, and the mood for resistance was very high. Unfortunately, Cheng's troops had no laws or discipline. Therefore, when they were about to retreat back to the lakeside, they carried out looting on a large scale, causing great resentment among the people. Zhu Xi, the commander of the Jiangnan First Advance Army, was stationed in Wuzhen, Yanji, and Xinshi. He usually resisted fiercely and inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army. In August, Cheng's troops under Gong Yinong were stationed in Shuanglin. The scum in his troops often harassed the people in the surrounding villages, causing deep resentment among the people. The people reported to Xinshi. Zhu Xi received an order from Commander Zhang on August 20 to encircle and suppress Gong's troops. Gong learned about it in advance and fled to the lakeside.

In July, Cheng's troops had been reorganized into the Loyalty Army Taihu Action Corps, but the military discipline was still not in order, and the troops were not suitable for legal organization. Therefore, each unit became a phenomenon of few guns and many people. Even in each brigade, the number of people ranged from five or six hundred to as few as ten or more. Tian Wenlong was known as the most loyal and brave in the war of resistance. Unfortunately, Tian was violent and lacked political awareness. In October, because he did not agree with Cheng's surrender to the enemy and strongly opposed it at the meeting, Cheng used the pretext that Tian disobeyed orders and attempted to rebel to mobilize troops, disarm Tian's entire force, and shoot Tian's legs with machine guns. Tian's whereabouts are now unknown.

After Tian was eliminated by Cheng Wanjun, a certain Xie, the head of the Wujiang puppet police brigade, came to the lakeside at the instigation of the Japanese to secretly discuss several decisions with Cheng Wanjun. Cheng then decided to surrender to the enemy and went to Wujiang on November 25 to contact the Japanese. The Japanese sent people to Nanku on the 27th to inspect and recruit Cheng's troops. At this time, soldiers who were determined to resist the Japanese and local strongmen who were unwilling to surrender to the Japanese fled one after another, causing the number of people to be insufficient. At this time, Cheng used his old trick of "conscripting men" from the people to supplement the numbers in order to gain the trust of the Japanese and make a contribution to surrender.

Now, in the lakeside area, since Cheng Wanjun surrendered to the Japanese, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes have continued to be collected. At the same time, Jin Luwang also established a "Food Support Association for Resisting the Enemy," collecting a land tax of one yuan and four corners of national currency per mu and another two dou of white rice per mu. Therefore, Jin Luwang extracted most of the farmers' annual hard-earned income. It is said that Cheng's surrender to the enemy resulted in the Japanese allocating tens of thousands of yuan per month. Therefore, not only could the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes not be abolished, but they were used in the name of "supporting the resistance against the enemy" to plunder the blood and sweat of the people. Such wanton exploitation of the people is truly hateful. The troops currently stationed in the lakeside area under Cheng's command include those of Cao Chunqing and Sun Ziqing. Cao Chunqing is stationed in Wu Lou, and Sun Ziqing is stationed in Lujia Port. These fellows specialize in "setting out" in the name of conscription, looting in various villages. Therefore, those in the lakeside area who have a little to eat have been completely plundered by these fellows. Farmers dare not go to Wu Lou and Lujia Port during the day and sleep next to the fields at night to prevent being conscripted. In this early winter cold, they are all crying out in pain.

### Brief News from the Yong River; Strictly Prohibit Smoking and Gambling in Fishing Areas; Direct Bus Service Between Jinhua and Ningbo

Ningbo Correspondence: Xu Zhen, Commissioner of the Sixth Administrative District of Zhejiang and concurrently Commander of the Security Forces, considered the Zhoushan Islands to be the foremost of China's four major fishing areas. However, every fishing season, when fishermen gather, there are often ruffians and hooligans who run brothels, set up gambling dens, and sell opium, luring the fishermen. This kind of evil practice has caused great harm to the fishermen. Now that the fishing season has arrived and the war of resistance is in full swing, it is urgent to strictly investigate and prohibit these activities. He specially ordered the magistrates of Dinghai and other counties to strictly order their subordinates to investigate and prohibit these activities, either by going to the towns to suppress them in person, or by sending personnel to garrison them, in order to weed out the bad elements and pacify the good, and to eliminate the decadent customs. The Commissioner's Office will also send personnel to inspect and investigate at any time.

The plan to operate direct bus service between Jinhua and Ningbo, which has been hindered for some time, has been approved by the Provincial Department of Transportation. It has been decided that the Provincial Highway Bureau and the Yin-Feng Long-Distance Bus Company will jointly operate the service. All preparations have been completed, and the service is scheduled to officially open on the 10th of this month.

### President Cheng of Sichuan University Removed from Office; Secretary-General Appointed Separately; Students and Faculty All Oppose

Reuters dispatch from Chengdu, 5th: At Sichuan University in Chengdu, due to the Ministry of Education's removal of Dr. Cheng Tianfang from the position of president and appointing another person to replace him, all the professors have risen up in opposition, and the turmoil has just begun. Furthermore, the appointment of a new secretary-general to the school has also caused new waves.

The Ministry of Education has sent a telegram to comfort them. Chairman Zeng of Sichuan Province has invited the professors to a dinner party in an attempt to mediate.

### Private Hangzhou Girls' Middle School Renamed Nanping Girls' Middle School; Ministry of Education Replies Approving Establishment

Ji Su, of the faculty and staff association of Zhejiang Provincial Hangzhou Girls' Middle School, in order to help students who have come to Shanghai continue their studies, has specially opened a private Hangzhou Girls' Middle School at No. 1510 Avenue Haig, Route Avenier. Ji serves as the principal, with ten faculty and staff members and over eighty students in one senior high class and three junior high classes. There are six classrooms. The school uses the instruments of the Shanghai Institute of Natural Science Experiments and McTyeire School for scientific experiments. In terms of experimental funding, in addition to the school's administrative income and students paying tuition fees each semester (30 yuan for senior high, 25 yuan for junior high), the deficit is all subsidized and maintained by the chief school director. Because the name "Hangzhou" is too limited to locality, the school has been renamed Nanping Girls' Middle School, and the Ministry of Education has replied approving the establishment. It is said that the school will recruit transfer students for all four senior and junior high grades during the winter vacation to expand the program.

### Philippine Tennis Star Quevedo Likely to Come to Shanghai, Currently Performing in Hong Kong

According to tennis circles, Philippine top tennis players Quevedo and Santos went to Hong Kong for performances at the end of last year and will be leaving Hong Kong to return home soon. If they pass through Shanghai, they may hold one or two exhibition matches. However, according to general speculation, the climate in the Philippines and Hong Kong is warmer, while the severe cold here is not suitable for tennis, so it is unlikely to become a reality.

### New Six Table Tennis Finals Postponed

The New Liu Cup table tennis tournament organized by the Zhejiang Industrial Bank colleagues was originally scheduled to have its finals at Lake Society at 7:00 PM on the 7th of this month. Now, because three teams have the same score, and two rounds of replays have failed to determine the right to the finals, it has to be postponed. The competition committee intends to announce the date of the finals after the right to the finals has been determined. The tickets that have been sold are still valid for admission.

### Novel Development in the Sports World

— Li Ren, dispatched from The Hague

(European Communications) Mr. Liangcai, the late curator of the Shen Bao, once said, "The newspaper is a mirror of society." The meaning is that the written spirit advances with the state of society. The New Year's publications of major newspapers in advanced Western countries are often dominated by "Sports Special Issues," occupying a significant portion, on par with the year's major events lists and retrospectives. This shows that strong countries rely on strong physiques and cultivate the national spirit of striving for self-improvement. Now, all kinds of games and amusements, commonly spread programs, all have united organizations. Universal harmony, such as the special competitions in countries like England, America, and France, has become a popular pastime in certain regions or social groups. Observing the reason why they can be new and unique, it generally starts from the mutual integration of two kinds of sports. By observing the following ten sections, one can silently understand the origin of the evolution of new sports techniques.

(1) Adding ice skating blades to the soles of shoes to play ice hockey. Ice hockey has been seen in the Winter World Games and world championships have been held.

(2) Stepping on ice skating wheels to play tennis on ice. Ice tennis is still rare in various countries.

(3) Simulating slalom skiing, using paddles on the water surface to pass through gates. This method has been created recently. It uses a small, light kayak, driven in a zigzag pattern on the water surface, passing through very low gates. In terms of speed, it is far from being as fast as skiing down a slope, but it requires overcoming many difficulties like an obstacle course, which is very laborious.

(4) Wearing skis and holding a long rope connected to a speedboat, using the power of the speedboat to move quickly: "Aquaplane" As the Chinese character explains, "'flying down and spreading wings in the air is called 'xiang' (翔)," which is similar to the meaning of the Western word "Plane." This game was created seven years ago and is the invention of Norwegian skiing champion Petersen. It is now popular on the French Riviera. The skis on the water must reach a high speed of 60 kilometers per hour (that is, progressing at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour) before they can float. At this time, the person breaking the waves and speeding forward can stand upright. If the speed of the speedboat is not very high, the person standing behind may lose balance and fall into the water immediately.

(5) Lying prone on a board, using both arms to paddle for speed on the water. The body should lie in the middle and slightly behind the center of the long board, with the back half sinking and the front half slightly raised. This game is suitable for summer, testing it on the water surface where the waves are neither too strong nor too weak. Once the oarsman is familiar with it, he can prepare it himself without worrying. It is said that in the water towns of America, there will even be a three-mile (that is, five kilometers) derby for comparing the speed of paddling with both arms. The winner relies on shoulder strength to win the championship, which is truly commendable.

(6) The water surface non-fall game, which maintains the balance of the center of gravity, is based on standing upright on a narrow and unstable rowing boat, extending both arms to the left and right, and quickly turning them to replace the propeller. The boat moves very slowly, and it is very difficult for the body not to fall into the water. This is a kind of "interlude" used in competitions for entertainment.

(7) Each person drives a motorcycle to try football: "Motorcycle Football." This is a way to combine motorcycles with other sports. For example, American stuntman Bend Hamilton even took the risk of riding a motorcycle to perform the "High Tower Diving" stunt, which amazed the audience.

(8) A water dragon football with only its name and no reality. Members of the German fire brigade play football, using water hoses and using the force of shooting water to launch a fierce attack.

(9) The waiter race that crosses the streets is held in Paris every year. In the last kilometer of the race, each contestant must walk while holding a tray of soup in his hand, and the first person to arrive with the least amount of soup spilling is the winner.

(10) Tandem races on bicycles are popular among Australians under British rule. In the tandem bicycle race, the male rider is usually in the front and the female rider is in the back.

Shanghai Special Issue

### A Brief Chronicle of the Great Shanghai in Ten Years

— Xuan Nan

The Shanghai Municipality was established on July 7, 1927 (16th year of the Republic), initially named the Shanghai Special Municipality, directly under the National Government. Huang Fu was appointed as the first mayor of the city. After taking office, Mayor Huang, based on the Provisional Regulations for the Shanghai Special Municipality promulgated by the National Government, appointed secretaries and bureau directors to take over various agencies and successively established the Secretariat and nine bureaus including Finance, Public Works, Public Security, Health, Public Utilities, Education, Land, Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, and Public Welfare to manage municipal affairs, and formulated various rules and regulations for promulgation and implementation to be observed. He also drafted the scope of the city's area and presented it to the National Government to instruct the Jiangsu Provincial Government to send personnel to conduct a joint survey to clarify jurisdiction and clear authority. Mayor Huang resigned after only two months in office due to a recurrence of an old illness. The National Government then appointed Zhang Dingfan as the successor mayor, who took office on September 16. To conserve administrative expenses, Mayor Zhang abolished the Bureau of Public Welfare at the end of September, and all matters under the bureau's jurisdiction were transferred to other bureaus for handling according to their nature. Subsequently, he began to delineate the powers of the province and the city, determine the scope of the city's administrative area, and take over the various cities and townships of Shanghai and Baoshan counties, uniformly renaming them as regions.

On July 3, 1928 (17th year of the Republic), the National Government promulgated the Organic Law of Special Municipalities. The Municipal Government reorganized in accordance with the law starting on August 1. The Bureau of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce was renamed the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the other offices and bureaus remained the same. On December 25, the Port Authority was established to handle matters related to the city's river ports, shorelines, docks, and ships.

In March 1929 (18th year of the Republic), Mayor Zhang also resigned due to illness, and Zhang Qun succeeded him. After taking office on April 1, Mayor Zhang focused on reorganizing and transforming the existing construction in the old urban area, delineating the city center area, and striving to promote the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Greater Shanghai Plan. On May 20 of the following year, the National Government promulgated the Municipal Organization Law, renaming all special municipalities as municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan. The Municipal Government reorganized in accordance with the law starting on July 1 of the same year, and was renamed Shanghai Municipality. Except for the Port Authority, which was ordered to be suspended and abolished in December of the same year, the internal organization of each office and bureau was slightly changed, and the names remained the same. On July 7, 1931 (20th year of the Republic), the groundbreaking ceremony for the new municipal building in the city center area was held, and construction began, originally scheduled to be completed in the following year. Later, due to the changing situation, Mayor Zhang resigned due to illness in January of the following year.

On January 7, 1932 (21st year of the Republic), Wu Tiecheng was ordered to succeed as mayor. Not long after Mayor Wu took office, the January 28 Incident occurred, lasting for more than three months. The essence of the urban area was greatly destroyed. He relieved the disaster area, comforted the refugees, and worked hard to overcome the difficulties. At the same time, given the vastness of the urban area and the difficulty of maintaining public security, the Municipal Security Office was established on August 1 of the same year. For the work of reconstruction and post-disaster relief, and the completion of the construction of the city center area, he continued to advance in order to realize the plan of Greater Shanghai. In October of the following year, the Municipal Government Building was completed, and Mayor Wu scheduled the opening ceremony to be held at 10:00 AM on National Day. In December, the Municipal Government moved in to work.

On New Year's Day in 1934 (23rd year of the Republic), the Municipal Government held an opening ceremony, celebrating the founding anniversary of the Republic of China, and holding an enlarged commemorative group and New Year's group worship ceremony. In order to promote the prosperity of the city center area, various facilities that a modern city should have also began to be implemented one by one. In addition to widening roads and opening parks for the convenience of citizens, other important projects such as libraries, museums, sports fields, gymnasiums, swimming pools, hospitals, health experiment institutes, elementary schools, radio broadcasting stations, and the Qujiang Wharf were all built in order.

In 1935 (24th year of the Republic), libraries, museums, sports fields, hospitals, health experiment institutes, elementary schools, etc., had all been completed one after another. Elementary schools opened in February, and the sports field was handed over to the organizing committee of the Sixth National Games in September. The Sixth National Games were held from October 10 to 20, and the city center was crowded with vehicles and horses, reaching a peak. After the closing of the conference, the Municipal Government took over, and after approving the organizational regulations, it implemented the opening as a place for citizens to exercise and compete. From 1936 (25th year of the Republic) until the fall of Shanghai, libraries, museums, hospitals, health experiment institutes, etc., were all equipped and arranged before opening one after another. The Shanghai Municipal Sports College was also established in the sports field. The first phase of construction of the Qujiang Wharf was also completed and opened first. Other construction projects, such as building the Longhua Scenic Area, establishing the Pudong Water Plant, and expanding the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's urban area user lines, were all being realized or promoted. How could we know that the anniversary of the establishment of Shanghai Municipality on July 7 was chosen by the Japanese to create an incident as one day of the war of aggression against China? How could we know that more than a month after the Lugouqiao Incident, the war in Shanghai would also break out! In March, when the chairman of Guangdong Province passed away, the National Government ordered Mayor Wu to succeed as chairman, and the position of mayor of Shanghai was still held by Yu Hongjun as acting. After the outbreak of the war, Yu risked his life as mayor, directing the citizens to rise up and resist the enemy. After four months of resistance, Shanghai fell. However, the people's spirit of Shanghai has not declined to this day. They all believe that the final victory will belong to our country, and that Greater Shanghai will eventually be restored by the people of Shanghai. The revival of Greater Shanghai will still be operated and completed by the Chinese people.

### Japan Attempts to Unilaterally Modify North China Customs Duties; British Consul General Submits Memorandum; Britain Decides Not to Recognize Japanese Tax Increases; Takes Retaliatory Measures If Necessary

The Japanese side's attempts to modify North China's customs duties, increase the tariffs on goods imported from Britain and the United States, and monopolize the Far East trade market are all conspiracies for which they have spared no effort to implement. The British and American consulates in Shanghai have been ordered to investigate, and the reports obtained are very detailed. The American consul general has already lodged a protest a few days ago to stop the Japanese side's actions that infringe on the interests of third countries, and the wording is quite stern. It is learned that the British consul general in Shanghai also submitted a memorandum to the Japanese side yesterday, stating in essence that if the Japanese side attempts to unilaterally modify North China's customs duties, the British side will definitely not agree to recognize it. If various serious consequences arise from this matter, all responsibilities will be borne by the Japanese side. It also stated that if the Japanese side does not abandon this exclusionary policy, Britain will, when necessary, unite with other countries to take retaliatory measures.

### Jianghai Customs Transfers Tax Revenue to Zhengjin Bank; Accumulates Over 20 Million; This Money Is Purely for Repaying British and American Foreign Debts; Jianghai Customs Has No Surplus to Spend and the Japanese Cannot Use It

A Express News Agency report from this city states that regarding the Jianghai Customs revenue, which is now forced to be transferred to Zhengjin Bank and suspended from being remitted to the government, Express News Agency reporters have investigated with the Jianghai Customs authorities. It is learned that the Jianghai Customs is in an unfavorable position, suffering repeated pressure on tax revenue issues. Since June of last year, it has been forced to transfer revenue to Zhengjin Bank. However, through the efforts of Mr. Luo Fu, although the revenue is transferred to Zhengjin Bank, it actually contains stringent conditions, that is, the Jianghai Customs revenue is still deposited in the Central Bank as usual, transferred by the Central Bank to the American-owned Maijiali Bank, and then deposited in Zhengjin Bank through Maijiali Bank. By the end of last year, it had reached more than 20 million yuan. However, there are three points that should be explained about this huge accumulation of tax revenue: 1. Jianghai Customs has no surplus since the war, so this tax revenue has not been remitted to the government and does not affect the national finances. 2. The tax revenue now transferred to Zhengjin Bank is purely for repaying foreign debts to Britain, the United States, etc., so it does not affect creditworthiness. 3. Jianghai Customs has no surplus since the war. The revenue now stored in Zhengjin Bank cannot be used by the Japanese, and there is not a single surplus available for distribution. As for the more than 20 million in tax revenue previously stored in HSBC Bank, it is still stored in HSBC, and this is also for repaying foreign debts.

### Chu Minyi Has Not Left Shanghai; Chu's Secretary Issues Statement; Denies Participating in Political Activities

A Express News Agency report from this city states that there have been rumors that Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee who remained in Shanghai, secretly left Shanghai in recent days. Yesterday, when Express News Agency reporters visited Mr. Chu, Chu's secretary, Tian Shoucheng, issued a statement on behalf of Mr. Chu, solemnly denying the rumors that he had left Shanghai and that he was communicating with each other by letter and participating in political activities. According to Mr. Tian, since the National Army withdrew to the west last year, Mr. Chu has remained in Shanghai to devote himself to cultural undertakings and preside over the affairs of the Sino-French Industrial School, after going to Chongqing once to ask the Ministry of Education for educational guidelines. He has stayed away from political activities and has never had any correspondence with Wang. Regarding the Wang incident, Mr. Chu only saw it in the newspapers. However, it is a fact that he refused to criticize it due to his difficult position. But it must be solemnly stated that it has absolutely nothing to do with the matter. He has not left Shanghai and goes to the Sino-French School to work every morning. The same is true today (the 5th). Recently, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association expanded its fundraising and requested Mr. Chu to write 500 couplets to raise funds for disaster relief. Therefore, in his spare time every day, he is writing couplets at his residence, so he has temporarily declined to meet guests.

### Japanese Planes Scatter Absurd Leaflets; Attempt to Confuse People; Reveal Desire for Peace; Citizens Scorn Them

(Reuters, Chongqing, 5th) Today, Japanese planes in Shanghai scattered leaflets printed with so-called telegrams from the Chinese ambassadors to Britain, France, and the United States to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek urging him to accept Wang Jingwei's peace proposals. A spokesman for the National Government said that this was a malicious fabrication intended to disturb the people's minds. Because a cabinet crisis occurred in Japan, causing a bad impression abroad, they are trying to spread malicious rumors that are unfavorable to China to divert the attention of the general public from Japan.

Since the Japanese side launched the war of aggression against China, its dream of a quick victory has been shattered due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army. Now that the war has entered the second stage, the Chinese army has launched a large-scale guerrilla war, which has made the Japanese army even deeper in the quagmire and unable to extricate itself. In addition, the domestic industry and commerce in Japan are declining and the economy is in crisis, so the desire for peace is extremely urgent. Therefore, they are releasing peace air indiscriminately, hoping to confuse the Chinese people and destroy the anti-Japanese camp. However, China is united in sincerity and is becoming more and more consolidated. The whole country, from top to bottom, has always supported the war of resistance and will never be shaken. Since Wang Jingwei willingly betrayed and was used by the Japanese side to issue a peace telegram, the whole country has unanimously condemned him. Seeing that their plan failed, the Japanese side again sent several planes at about 9:00 AM yesterday to scatter absurd leaflets in the sky over this city, fabricating various rumors, falsely claiming that Chinese envoys abroad suggested peace methods, and that so-and-so supported Wang Jingwei's ideas. Their despicable intentions and childish actions are really ridiculous. Citizens throughout the city all sneered at the leaflets.

The English Great America Evening Post reported that from 9:45 this morning, two Japanese planes scattered two kinds of absurd leaflets in the sky north of the Suzhou River, which floated with the wind to the central area of the two concessions and fell to the ground. The leaflets were divided into yellow and green. One was Wang Jingwei's absurd telegram, with a small photo of him attached. The other was the so-called joint telegram for peace from Gu Weijun, the ambassador to France, Guo Taiqi, the ambassador to England, and Hu Shi, the ambassador to the United States. This move is nothing more than an attempt to create rumors and confuse the public. The two planes did not fly back until 10:30 AM.

### Pudong Guerrilla Encounter with Japanese Troops: Japanese Troops on High Alert Along Pudong Avenue

Around noon the day before yesterday, over a hundred guerrillas suddenly appeared near Zhoupu Town in Pudong and engaged in an encounter with Japanese troops stationed in Zhoupu in the countryside. Although it was daytime, both sides used rifles and machine guns to counterattack. The Japanese troops, realizing the unfavorable terrain and fearing encirclement, dragged several small steel cannons from Zhoupu to bombard and assist in the battle. The rumbling sound shook the surrounding areas. By evening, guerrillas along the Zhangjialou area of the Pudong riverbank also showed a tendency to attack the Japanese naval defense zone on Pudong Avenue. The situation suddenly became extremely tense. The 3rd and 5th Battalions of the Japanese Navy were simultaneously mobilized with weapons. Emergency alerts were implemented along Pudong Avenue and Dongchang Road, and land and water transportation was blocked. Pedestrians disappeared from the streets, and Japanese sentries were stationed every three to five people. The Dongchang Road ferry was closed early at 5:10 PM. After the Japanese troops guarded the riverbank all night, seeing no movement, their terrified spirits finally settled down. At dawn, they dispersed into the countryside east of Pudong Avenue, searching civilian houses door to door, but found nothing. The Dongchang Road ferry reopened as usual at 2:00 AM yesterday. The alerts in various places also tended to relax, and land transportation returned to its original state. Regarding the Sino-Japanese military encounter the day before yesterday afternoon, it is said that ten Japanese soldiers were killed and more than twenty were wounded. It is reported that the guerrilla side suffered no losses.

### Dinghai Order Restored: Guerrillas Waiting for Reorganization; Ningbo Defense Command Sends Personnel to Investigate; Navigation Resumes Without Major Damage

Following suppression by the authorities, the guerrilla uprising in Dinghai Island, Zhejiang Province, retreated to Hengliang, awaiting reorganization. Order in the county town has been completely restored, and transportation ships have resumed operations. The Ningbo City Defense Command has dispatched senior officials to Dinghai to investigate. Fenghua and other counties have established reward measures for arresting bandits. Detailed information is as follows:

This Newspaper's Telegram

Ningbo Special Telegram from this newspaper, dated the 4th: The Xuchengde unit of the Fengxian guerrilla force, which withdrew from Dinghai, has been ordered to be transferred to Xinchang for reorganization and training. On the 1st, they demanded 50,000 yuan from the county, but were refused. On the 2nd, they released prisoners and engaged in a two-hour battle with the First Water Police Team, resulting in five police and civilians dead and over ten injured. The next morning, reinforcements arrived, and Xu led his troops, along with the released prisoners, aboard the Tianma Wheel to retreat to Hengliang, awaiting reorganization. Order in Dinghai has been restored. On the 3rd, the defense department dispatched senior officials to investigate.

The Suppression Process

The Xuchengde unit of the guerrilla forces from Fengxian, Chuansha, and other places (formerly the Special Operations Unit of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee), totaling over three hundred people, was ordered to be transferred to Xinchang County in eastern Zhejiang for reorganization and training. After arriving in Dinghai by civilian ship at the end of December last year, they demanded 50,000 yuan from the local authorities on the 1st of this month, but were refused, and actually carried out an uprising. At that time, the local water police were ordered to suppress them, but due to their weak strength, the county town was occupied by the guerrillas. After the Haimen Water Police Team sent a company of water police, together with troops dispatched from Ningbo, to suppress them, the guerrillas were defeated and surrounded by the military police, forced to surrender their weapons, and escorted onto the Tianma Wheel to retreat to Hengliang.

Order Restored

This guerrilla force has been disarmed and concentrated in Hengliang, awaiting reorganization by the authorities. At the same time, a company of armed police officers was dispatched by the Water Police Headquarters, led by the captain, to Hengliang (located fifteen li outside the east gate of Nandinghai, it is a coastal town), to closely monitor them. The Tianma Wheel is a small steamer that operates between Dinghai and Shenjiamen. Order in Dinghai County was quickly restored. During the guerrilla uprising, approximately thirty water police officers were killed or injured. It is reported that over ten villagers were injured by stray bullets. Fortunately, there was no major damage in the area. The Ningbo City Defense Commander dispatched senior officials to Dinghai on the 3rd to investigate jointly with the county magistrate.

Navigation as Usual

The Dinghai Native Place Association in Shanghai and various shipping merchants received telegrams from Haimen and Ningbo yesterday, stating that order in Dinghai has been restored and the area is peaceful. As for the Dinghai radio station, it was damaged by the guerrillas at that time and has not yet been repaired, so it has not yet resumed reporting. Foreign ships operating between Haidou, Shipu, Dinghai, and Ningbo: (1) The American Huamei Company's Tangsai, which sailed from Haimen to Yong yesterday morning, decided to also stop at Dinghai. (2) The Portuguese Meili Company's Meida is allowed to sail from Ningbo to Haimen this morning and also decided to stop at Dinghai. (3) The Tianbao and Libao wheels, operating between Ningbo and Dinghai, have resumed normal operation from the 4th, restoring their original schedules.

Dispatching Personnel to Investigate

Guo Chiping, the Ningbo City Defense Commander, was very angry about the Dinghai incident. In addition to sending senior officials to Dinghai for investigation, he has telegraphed Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Liu Jianxu, Commander-in-Chief of the Tenth Army Group, with detailed information on the guerrilla uprising and the suppression. He has also requested instructions on everything. It is reported that the superior officer of the guerrilla unit has been detained by the suppressing military police. After requesting instructions from higher authorities and deciding on a course of action, they will be severely punished.

### American Wireless Radio Company Continues Operations; US Federal Communications Commission Opposes Japanese Supervision

The Continental News reports that yesterday afternoon (the 4th), according to information from a private source in Washington, D.C., any attempt to "supervise" or inspect telegrams sent by the Shanghai office of the Global Wireless Radio Company will be opposed by the US Federal Communications Commission. However, the Japanese protest against the company sending telegrams in Shanghai, and what action the State Department will take, is another matter.

After receiving the Japanese protest, US Consul General Gauss soon forwarded it to Washington. The US Federal Communications Commission received information about this move yesterday and is now studying this report with the State Department. According to news received in this port yesterday, the FCC has indicated that it intends to maintain the company's current status.

### Severe Disaster in Northern Jiangsu; Cultivable Land Turned into Swamps; 1.5 Million Destitute Refugees

The Continental News reports that yesterday (the 4th), according to a representative of the Northern Jiangsu International Relief Committee, if funds cannot be obtained immediately to engage in relief work in Northern Jiangsu, then the 1.5 million destitute refugees in that area will inevitably suffer from hunger and cold in the next two months. According to the committee's report, there are currently a total of 2,855,425 destitute refugees in the area. The committee needs funds of 1,492,500 yuan to support these refugees until the end of February, so that they can get through the

Spring Season Without Harvest

Because almost all of the cultivable land in the area has now turned into swamps. As of the end of last year, the committee had launched a large-scale relief program in the area and raised no less than 850,000 yuan, including 200,000 yuan from public donations, 300,000 yuan promised by the Jiangsu Refugee Relief Committee, 100,000 yuan from the International Red Cross, and 20,000 yuan pledged by the International Relief Committee itself. The homes of the refugees have now been destroyed by the war or

Floods Throughout the Province

Most of them rely on relief agencies to provide shelter. In addition to running porridge distribution stations, the committee also distributes cash to the destitute, with adults receiving one yuan per month and children receiving five jiao each. It is estimated that it will cost 150,000 yuan to maintain the porridge distribution stations over the winter. When spring comes, the committee plans to oversee the excavation of two rivers in Jiangsu Province, connecting the Grand Canal with the Yellow Sea, and employ these refugees to work. According to experts,

Excavating Two Rivers

In addition to employing refugees and providing them with work, it will also help alleviate the flooding situation in Jiangsu Province, because most of the floods in Jiangsu Province are caused by the flooding of lakes and rivers. Excavating new channels to the sea can reduce the possibility of flooding. It is hoped that all sectors will generously donate. Educational groups are organizing the "Wang Yiting Memorial Meeting Preparatory Office", and have publicly elected Pan Shesheng as the director of the preparatory office, and Shen Lianfang and Yan Junxuan as deputy directors. The office has established four groups: documentation, administration, public relations, and design, with Wu Dongmai, Shen Tianxin, Zhao Sichen, and Ling Songru serving as the directors of each group. They are actively preparing for the memorial service, which is scheduled to be held at the Lake Society at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month, to express their condolences. All fellow villagers from the Lake District are welcome to attend. Any condolences can be sent in advance to the Lake Society at the intersection of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road, where they will be forwarded to the memorial meeting preparatory office.

### Banking Association Studies Rules for Renting Safe Deposit Boxes: In Order to Serve as a Reference for Revising the Rules; Hope Fellow Industries Will Provide as Many Opinions as Possible

The "Shanghai City Safe Deposit Box Rental Rules" were completely discussed and finalized by the Safe Deposit Box Business Research Association in the second year of the Republic of China. After being unanimously adopted by various banks, several years have passed. Now various banks and trust companies believe that the nature of the safe deposit box business is very important. Recently, the number of banks and trust companies concurrently operating this business has increased daily, and the business has become increasingly complex. The original twenty-two rental rules, if not revised or supplemented, are insufficient to meet the current needs. Therefore, the Safe Deposit Box Business Research Association decided to revise these rules. At the same time, in order to expand the organization, the Banking Association's Practical Research Association organized a safe deposit box team to undertake this discussion. This case has been discussed many times. After complete discussion and results are obtained, it will be provided to each bank for reference. If any fellow industry members have opinions on these safe deposit box rental rules, it is hoped that they will be provided at any time to facilitate convening a discussion. Now, Articles 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17, and 19 have been decided upon as a result of discussion. The remaining articles are still under discussion and research.

### Japan's Excessive Issuance of Banknotes Reaches Unprecedented High Record; Exceeds the Maximum Limit of Gold Reserves; Totals a Huge 470 Million

The Continental News reports that in the last few days of the end of last year, the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan reached an unprecedented high record. As of December 27th of last year, the banknotes issued by the bank had reached 2,677,878,000 Japanese yen, exceeding the amount of banknotes in circulation during the Japanese economic crisis in 1927. This number is 476,591,000 Japanese yen greater than the legal maximum amount that the Bank of Japan is allowed to issue under the current Japanese banking laws, based on its gold reserves. The Bank of Japan's excessive issuance of banknotes exceeded this limit, disregarding the legal restrictions on its activities, and not hesitating to violate the law by excessively issuing banknotes without legal gold reserves.

### Progress in the Sale of Chinese Tea; Hong Kong and Shanghai Sales Share the Market Equally

Tea is a specialty of our country, with a large amount exported every year. After the war, domestic and foreign sales were changed to be implemented and controlled by the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission, and production and sales both increased. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is promoting tea planting in the border provinces, designating tea-producing areas and implementing it separately. The following is a detailed account of the changes in the tea sales and export trade after the war:

Post-War Sales Completely Controlled

Chinese tea's foreign trade was previously handled by foreign firms and tea houses, and the tea needed by foreign tea houses was purchased by personnel sent to the mountains to collect it when the new tea came on the market, and then transported to Shanghai for sale. Although the provincial governments of Anhui and Jiangxi had once controlled the sale of black tea before the war, transporting it from the producing areas to Shanghai for trading, after the outbreak of the war, the Trade Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Finance immediately implemented control over the domestic and foreign sales of black and green tea nationwide. The Fuhua Trading Company was established to purchase tea from all over the country and sell it directly abroad, eliminating various malpractices before the war, benefiting tea farmers, and developing foreign sales with remarkable results.

Hong Kong and Shanghai Share the Market Equally

The Trade Adjustment Committee's implementation of tea sales control initially stipulated that all black and green tea must be concentrated in Hong Kong for trading. Later, at the request of the Shanghai Foreign Tea House Association, in order to maintain the business of each tea house, the Trade Commission assessed grades A and B, stipulating that Grade A must be transported to Hong Kong, and Grade B was allowed to be settled and transported to Shanghai, where tea houses were free to trade with foreign firms. Therefore, according to customs statistics, after the implementation of control, the total export volume in Shanghai from January to November this year reached 13,037,257 yuan, and the total export volume in Hong Kong from January to September was 11,216,747 yuan, which can be said that Hong Kong and Shanghai share the market equally.

A Glimpse of Changes in Domestic and Foreign Transactions

After the Mo Aunts Trade Adjustment Committee implemented the control of tea sales, Fuhua Trading Company immediately opened a trading floor in Hong Kong. Because it was difficult for all the black and green tea merchants with stores in Shanghai to move immediately, they sent one representative to Hong Kong, specializing in weighing and collecting money. If foreign firms needed to purchase goods, they could trade with Fuhua Company, which was the most powerful tea agency. As for Grade B tea transported to Shanghai, it was mostly concentrated in Wenzhou. In order to facilitate the settlement and sale of foreign exchange and handle transportation and sales, foreign tea houses in Shanghai specially established a joint office in Wenzhou to manage everything. After Grade B tea was transported to Shanghai, foreign firms could trade with each foreign tea house as usual.

Better Production, Increased Sales

This year's tea production in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui and other provinces has been good. In previous years, the output of Keemun black tea and Ningzhou black tea was no more than 80,000 boxes. This year, Fuhua Company purchased and transported 118,000 boxes to Hong Kong. In the past, the annual output of Pingshui green tea was 200,000 boxes, but this year it has also increased to 250,000 boxes. In terms of foreign sales, the majority of black and green tea controlled by Fuhua Company was mainly purchased by the Soviet Union, followed by the United Kingdom, and then the United States. Germany also purchased some. After the implementation of control, foreign sales of tea strive to improve and are able to cater to the tastes of Europeans and Americans, so the amount of foreign sales has increased compared to the past.

### Allocation of Fourth-Term Charity Lottery Relief Funds Announced; Actual Sales of 167,000 Yuan; 30% of the Total Allocated to Relief

The fourth term of the French charity lottery for refugee relief sold an actual number of 33,400 tickets, each sold for five yuan, totaling 167,000 yuan in national currency. Thirty percent of this amount, or 50,100 yuan, should be allocated for relief funds. Yesterday, Father Rao and other members of the lottery allocation committee held a meeting to discuss the principles of allocation. It was decided that 10% would be allocated as overseas Chinese charity relief funds and 90% would be allocated to Chinese refugee relief. It was subsequently decided to allocate 5,010 yuan to various Western charity organizations for overseas Chinese relief expenses, 30,090 yuan to the Nanshi Refugee Relief Committee for refugee relief expenses, and 15,000 yuan to the Shanghai Refugee Association for refugee relief expenses. The total allocation of 50,100 yuan has been separately allocated to each charity for verification. The fifth term is scheduled to be drawn at Yiyuan on the afternoon of the 12th of this month at 2:00 PM. Each ticket is sold for only five yuan. There are a total of 5,830 prizes, with the top prize being 50,000 yuan. Each strip is worth 10,000 yuan. If the number of sales is insufficient, it is guaranteed that each strip will receive 7,500 yuan.

Mine Ash Association Donates to Relief Efforts

The Shanghai Mine Ash Industry Association believes that there are many refugees in Shanghai and that it is difficult to provide them with food and clothing. It has repeatedly approved the Refugee Relief Association's request to raise funds for relief expenses. The industry has joined forces with the operators of the lime transportation business to decide to hold a business donation. From this month, a donation of one cent per dan of lime will be donated to the Refugee Relief Fund, and it will be tentatively implemented for six months. Currently, the leaders of the two industries, Ma Shaoquan, Lu Fusheng, Li Zhongxiang, and others, are discussing the handling procedures with various colleagues, and they are about to be completed. They will report to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association for filing.

Jade Jewelry Industry Adopts Refugees

The Shanghai Jade Jewelry Industry Association is enthusiastic about relief work. Since the Association's Citizen Group initiated the refugee adoption movement, it has carried out fundraising from various companies and individuals in the industry. It has raised a total of 3,072 yuan in national currency, which was sent to the Association's Citizen Group Fundraising Committee yesterday morning.

Citizen Group Schedules Regular Meetings

The Refugee Association's Citizen Group Fundraising Committee decided to broadcast fundraising and adopt refugees, and all parties enthusiastically participated. In addition to continuing to send personnel to collect donations from all walks of life, it also scheduled a regular committee meeting on January 9 (Monday) to organize and announce the broadcast donations, and will continue to promote the work of the fundraising team.

Jiangsu Relief Association Saves Refugees Through Paintings

The Jiangsu Relief Association, in order to raise funds for the refugee children's education and nursing home, specially borrowed the building in the Shanghai New Market on Jing'an Temple Road as a venue for a painting exhibition. There are more than a thousand pieces of ancient and modern works, most of them framed, and they are changed and displayed every day. The prices are particularly low. People who love calligraphy and painting should not miss this opportunity. If you buy them as gifts, you will feel elegant and precious. It's a win-win situation and a gospel for the refugee children.

Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association Exhibits Paintings

Mr. Huang Jinrong's son, Yuan Tao, is participating in the preparation of a calligraphy and painting exhibition in the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association Hall on Yu Qiaqing Road. It will be exhibited for three days from January 10 to the evening of the 12th. Ms. Zhou Jie, Ms. Chen Moyin, and Ms. Wang Ruiquan are invited to display their usual collections of fine works in this place. All the proceeds from the sales, after deducting the cost of paper and ink, will be allocated to help refugees.

### Japanese Merchant Ships Attacked: Actually Attempting to Benefit Guerillas; Intending to Pay a Monthly Special Fee; But Rejected by All Armies in Stern Terms

The Japanese Qing Shipping Company, since the commercial ships Huadong and Dexin, which operated on the blockade line ports in November last year, were intercepted by guerrillas at Yanglinkou and Changyinsha respectively, suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the company is particularly vigilant. Whenever each ship passes through the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it does not dare to fly the Japanese flag to avoid being noticed. At the same time, the ship also requested the Japanese military headquarters to send additional Japanese troops to be on guard to prevent accidents, and the inspection of merchants and passengers was extremely strict, causing trouble for merchants and passengers to load goods. In addition, the Japanese soldiers escorting the ship sometimes committed acts of drunkenness and violence, which the merchants and passengers complained about. In the event of an interception by guerrillas, both goods and lives would be difficult to protect, so cargo transportation has declined to a great extent. Although it superficially implements control, the result is that not only can the ideal not be achieved, but there is also the possibility of increasing danger at any time. Based on these reasons, the Japanese Qing Company actually came up with a whimsical idea to win over customs brokers and transshipment companies to help them clear the way with the guerrillas in various ports along the river, intending to subsidize them with a certain amount each month or each shift as a special fee. However, it is understood that the Japanese Qing Company's attempt has been sternly rejected by guerrillas in various places.

### Zhejiang Postal Administration Approved to Move Back to Hangzhou; Lishui to Be Re-designated as an Office

The Zhejiang Postal Administration, which retreated from Hangzhou to Jinhua in eastern Zhejiang a few years ago and then moved to Lishui to operate, is now permitted to move back to Hangzhou. This is because various branches in Hangzhou and post offices along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line, such as Jiaxing, Jiashan, Xiashi, Wangdian, etc., have gradually resumed operations. However, it has been inconvenient for these post offices to contact the Zhejiang General Administration for business. Therefore, Ke Deng, the Director of the Zhejiang Postal Administration, submitted a request to the Kunming Postal General Administration, seeking permission to move back to Hangzhou. According to a message from the Zhejiang Postal Administration's Shanghai office, the order from the Kunming Postal General Administration has been received, approving the relocation back to Hangzhou for normal operations. However, the Lishui office will be re-designated as an office. The relocation date has not yet been decided. It is reported that some postal staff and important documents have already been shipped from Lishui and will arrive in Shanghai soon for transfer to Hangzhou. The plan to relocate to Ningbo has now been abandoned.

### Passengers Traveling to Hong Kong Must Be Vaccinated Against Smallpox

The company has now received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that passengers traveling to Hong Kong now only need to be vaccinated against smallpox and no longer need vaccinations.

### Gangsters in the Western District Transferred to the Central Police Station; More Suspects Arrested Yesterday and a Hand Grenade Seized

The twelve bandits arrested by the British Concession Police and the Japanese army in the Dunxin Road area of ​​western Shanghai the day before yesterday were taken away by Japanese vehicles. After the Public Concession Police requested extradition, they were transferred to the Central Police Station at about 4 pm yesterday.

Between 3 and 4 pm yesterday, a large number of detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station, together with members of the reserve team, arrested two Chinese suspects in a thatched shed in Caojiadu and seized a hand grenade. The detectives led by Detective Hill also arrested seven accomplices in a house on Robert Road. All the criminals were detained by the Japanese side. It is believed that these people are related to many armed robbery cases in the western district, or have some connection with the criminals arrested in Fahua Town on Wednesday.

According to the "China Press", the gangsters in the western district are rampant. The personnel of the Public Concession Police Department are working tirelessly day and night to track down these gangsters. Yesterday (the 4th), in the afternoon, six men and three women were arrested in a thatched house 200 yards away from Columbia Road. During the arrest, the two sides opened fire fiercely, but no one was injured. The gangsters also threw two or three pistols into the river. By evening, the Police Department had recovered one of them, which was a pistol taken from the police by the gangsters.

Automatic Pistol

One of those arrested was a suspect who was seriously injured twice near Dunxin Road on Monday night, with bullet wounds on his head and chest. He was sent to the Police Hospital last night and is still in critical condition. In addition, three more gangsters were arrested in the concession, all of whom were men. Only these three and the injured suspect were detained by the Police Department last night, because the Japanese authorities refused to extradite the other gangsters. The reason for this attitude of the Japanese side is unknown as of late last night. The Municipal Council believes that the detention of five men and three women by the Japanese military police has made the investigation

Seriously hindered

And made the Police Department lose the opportunity to continue arresting important gangsters. It is strongly suspected that those arrested also participated in the gang that robbed foreigners and Chinese in cars on Columbia Road on Danzhou. Before this case, the detectives of the General Police Station had worked hard to investigate. Shortly after noon yesterday, it was learned that a gangster who was injured in the shootout with the police outside Dunxin Road on Monday was hiding in a secret location outside the concession, being taken care of by his gangsters. The location of his hiding place was in Fahua Town, 200 yards west of Columbia Road, not far from the place where British and American expatriates were robbed of money and jewelry on the night of December 28. Detectives and reserve police officers from the General Police Station,

Jointly with the Japanese Army

Military police officers from the Military Police Department went to the town. The gangster's den was in a thatched house next to Fahua Hong (transliteration), which was not easy to find. When about 30 detectives approached the thatched house, the gangsters inside opened fire fiercely from inside. The detectives immediately returned fire. The gangsters, knowing that they were outnumbered and surrounded, threw two or three pistols into the sewer and surrendered. Both sides fired many shots, but apparently no one was hit. The detectives then approached the thatched house and arrested the gangsters inside, along with the one who was injured in the shootout outside Dunxin Road on Monday. A total of six men and three women, plus the three arrested in the concession, counted as suspects.

A total of twelve

, three of whom were questioned in the Police Station last night about their involvement in which crimes. The fourth was lying in the Police Hospital and was still in critical condition. Although the rest were needed by the Police Department, they were in the hands of the Japanese side. In the afternoon yesterday, the work of recovering the abandoned guns began immediately. After a long time, a gun was found in the mud at dusk, a .38 caliber special type. It was identified as the gun lost by the Police Department.

### Das Case: Criminals Sentenced; Cook Receives One and a Half Years of Imprisonment

Guo Xingwu, the owner of Yuantai Soil Company in Tianjin, concealed 153 pounds of opium in the wheels of a ship and brought it to Shanghai on December 11 last year. He entrusted Meng Yuebo, the owner of Xieyi Fruit Shop at No. 701 Jiujiang Road, to sell it on his behalf. Meng then entrusted his apprentice Qian Yaoting to pick up the goods at the 16th Pier and transport them to the intersection of Sichuan Road and Guangdong Road in a rickshaw. Qian's brother Yaoliang, in collusion with Qian Yongchang and others, intercepted the goods. Later, due to infighting, they were discovered by Sun Wenxi, a Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station, and Detective Xu Dezhong. Qian Yongchang, Zhou Deming, Zhou Wangshi, Qian Yaoliang, Meng Yuebo, and others, along with the opium, were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin ascended to the second criminal court and announced the verdict: Meng Yuebo was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights for helping others sell opium. Wang Weilan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for the same crime. Qian Yaoliang was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for joint encroachment.

### Buddhist Scoundrel Sentenced for Extortion

Xu Shengfa, a woman from Funing, Jiangbei, who lives at No. 30 Carter Road, Xinzha, is a devout Buddhist. Therefore, she practices Buddhism with hair in the nearby Tongshantang. Xu once worked as a priest in the Xifang Zen Temple in Zhabei two years ago, and met Shao Shijin, a Jiangbei native who was a temple worker. Unexpectedly, Shao had ulterior motives and repeatedly used fraudulent means to extort money from Xu. Recently, Shao wanted to extort a large sum of money from Xu but failed. Therefore, he discussed with Miao Feng, a monk from Guanyintang at No. 75 Wengen Road, and the gangster Yao Baojin, wanting to find a way to slander her. On the 26th of last month, Xu Shengfa and her sister-in-law Xu Zhangshi were passing by the intersection of Aven Avenue and Changsha Road. Shao Shijin took the opportunity to insult her, intending to extort 1,800 yuan. The case was reported by Xu and the police were dispatched to arrest Shao and Miao Feng, and they were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the court continued to interrogate them. The police lawyer, Shu Zhishan, stated the investigation situation during the change of date. Judge Fu questioned the two defendants clearly and sentenced Shao Baojin to one year and six months of imprisonment for threatening to make people hand over property but failing, and Miao Feng to one year of imprisonment. A fake contract was confiscated.

### Huge Amount of Morphine Shipped from Tianjin; Handler Steals from His Employer; Distributor Negotiates Compensation; False Accusation Leads to Arrest

Li Fuqi, a native of Yong, owns a large amount of money and is engaged in the drug business in Tianjin. He divides a huge amount of the drug morphine into rubber bags that are about one foot long and one inch wide. Each bag weighs from more than ten taels to dozens of taels. He entrusted Lou Fuchang, a fellow villager who is the head of the Hailike Foreign Wheel, to bring them to Shanghai and deliver them to Gu Pingyang, a native of Yong who lives in a pavilion room at No. 83 Baliaoqiao Street, French Concession, for sale. Lou arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month and only delivered four rubber bags of morphine to Gu Pingyang.

Eight Bags Missing

Gu pursued him, and Lou claimed that he had lost them on the way. In fact, Lou had swallowed them. Gu negotiated compensation with Lou. The dispute lasted for two days and nights. The night before, Gu invited Lou to the Da Hu Hotel on Aiduya Road to open room 404 to negotiate compensation. Lou went with his wife, Zhang. Because he had no words to unload the funds, he asked for 8,000 yuan in compensation. He only agreed to issue a loan note for 1,200 yuan. At 6 am yesterday morning, Lou's wife, Zhang, reported to the Public Police Station, saying that her husband, Lou Fuchang, had been cornered in

Da Hu Hotel

Room 404 was being torn down. Because the Da Hu Hotel was in the French Concession, the police notified the French police and dispatched detectives Jiang Changwen and Gao Meiyan, and police officer Wang Changchun, to rush to room 404 of the Da Hu Hotel. At that time, Lou Fuchang had already escaped on the pretext of going to the toilet. Only Gu Pingyang and six accomplices from Yong, Zhang Tinghua, Qian Kangsheng, Wang Ayuan, Cao Hongxing, and Yu Abiao, who were helping Gu monitor Lou, were arrested. After learning that it was due to the shortage of morphine sold,

Negotiating Compensation

The detectives then went to Gu Pingyang's residence and copied out four rubber bags of morphine, totaling 900 grams, and brought them back to the police station together with the informant Lou Zhang. Yesterday afternoon, the six criminals, Gu Zhangqian, Cao Wangyu, were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated them. Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer representing the administrative authorities of the French Concession, stated the case and requested a change of date for further investigation. Then, the detectives reported the process of arresting the defendants. The court verified the report and questioned the defendants once. They were instructed to change the date for another hearing on the 14th. The defendants were sent back to prison.

### Large Fire on North Shanxi Road Last Night Kills Three Lives Destroys Several Houses and Injures Eight Men and Women

The house at No. 444 North Shanxi Road was rented by Niu Huaijin from Anhui. The downstairs was rented to Qinghe Rice Shop. Niu himself lived on the third floor. At 3:15 yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen of the house. Because it was late at night, the discovery was delayed, causing the fire to spread immediately. After receiving the report, the Huisi Police Station immediately dispatched Detective Fang Qingyun and Police Officer Zhao Ziduo to maintain order. They immediately notified the fire brigade to drive to the scene to put out the fire. However, the wind was very strong at the time, so it was difficult to extinguish the fire for a while. Despite the efforts to put out the fire, the result was the destruction of several houses. The houses destroyed were the overpass buildings at Nos. 438, 440, 442, 444, and 446 at the intersection of Zhaoyuanli, North Shanxi Road, all of which were destroyed. Because it was late at night, many people were unable to escape, resulting in three deaths and eight injuries. After investigation by the police officers, the deceased were identified as Hu Fusheng (32 years old, from Anhui) and his two-year-old son Hu Jindi, and Zhang Yuzhen (49 years old) who lived in the rear building on the third floor. The names of the injured were Niu Huaijin (42 years old, from Anhui), Niu Tangshi (45 years old, from Changzhou), Ni Futang (42 years old, from Shaoxing), Ni Tianshi (32 years old, from Shaoxing), Xu Wangshi (23 years old, from Shaoxing), Shi Xizheng (56 years old, from Haimen), Hu Jianheng (10 years old, from Anhui), and Chen (44 years old, from Shaoxing). The police officers sent the deceased to the mortuary for examination and sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. They also conducted a more detailed investigation into the cause of the fire. The police station reported to the First Special District Court and appointed a prosecutor to go to the mortuary to examine the bodies, confirming that they died from burns suffered before death. They ordered that coffins be provided for burial.

### Fake Police Station on Daxi Road Closed by British Army

The branch office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which used to be located at the east side of the intersection of Daxi Road and Columbia Road, which was built beyond the concession in western Shanghai, was dissolved after the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the retreat of the Chinese army to the west. Later, a fake "police station" of the "Great Way Municipal Government" was established, and a fake "patrol chief" sent by the Xujiahui fake "police station" led more than ten fake "police" to guard the area. Recently, due to the rampant bandits in western Shanghai, the Public Concession Police Department sealed off the traffic in the area for the sake of protecting the security of the concession. Unexpectedly, British troops suddenly arrived at about 9 am yesterday and sealed the doors and windows of the fake branch office with barbed wire, and posted a note on the door saying "This house is closed by order of the British Army." In the afternoon, several senior Japanese officials accompanied several fake "police officers" to inspect the site, and the debris piled up at the door was not moved.

### Huang Jinrong Temple Director

The Yimiao Square run by Wan Molin and others was suspected of being a false loan. The Shanghai Yimiao Board of Directors, after obtaining the opinion of Director Du Yuesheng, held a meeting to resolve to oppose it. On the one hand, Director Huang Jinrong was asked to represent the association in his personal capacity to earnestly persuade Wan Molin and others to change the name and ban the sculpting of city gods. At noon yesterday, the Board of Directors held a temporary board meeting at Huang's residence on McGao Baolu Road. Directors Qin Yanqi, Huang Jinrong, Huang Hanzhi, Mao Zijian, Yao Huiquan, secretaries Lu Jinlin, Lu Baorong, Wang Zigang, director Huo Xueming, and attendees Fan Huichun and Jin Liren were present. First, Huang Jinrong reported on the progress of the negotiations, and then introduced Wan Yimolin, saying that the "Yimiao Market" had agreed to change its name to "Shanghai Public Concession Yimiao Market" to show that it was different from the official Yimiao Market in the city. The market will also publish a notice to disclose the origin of its renaming. The Board of Directors believed that the purpose of the negotiations had been achieved and approved the plan. However, it was absolutely forbidden to sculpt another city god to confuse the public and comply with the intentions of Director Du's letter. After the meeting, Director Huang hosted a banquet until 3 pm.

### Yuan San Denies Participating in Fake City Bank

This newspaper previously reported that Gu Disan would take the post of manager of the fake "City Bank". According to sources close to Gu, Gu is now nearly 70 years old and has been cut off from contact with the outside world for a long time. In addition, he has been living at home in recent years and is content. The statement that he will take the post of manager of the City Bank is not true and he has no intention of doing so. The report in the newspaper is probably a rumor.

### Large Gang of Bandits in Jurong County Murders New Fourth Army Paymaster, Brigadier Liang Zuocheng and His Son; Five Bandits Executed; Shanghai Municipal Police Continues to Arrest Suspects; Open Trial Held Yesterday; Supreme Court Orders Further Review

It is reported that last December, Ye Ting, the commander of the New Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, had an officer under his command named Liang Zuocheng escorting army pay to Jiangsu Province with soldiers. While passing through Qiaoxiang Village in Jurong County, Liang and his fifteen-year-old son were kidnapped by a large group of bandits armed with weapons. The bandits then murdered them and robbed 327,000 yuan in pay. Subsequently, Commander Ye dispatched a large detachment of soldiers to the village, where they arrested five bandits involved in the case: Da Yuanlin, Chen Youfa, Qiao Detai, Qiao Yikun, and Zhang Bingquan. After interrogation, all were found guilty and executed by firing squad. Last September, Shanghai Municipal Police detective Shang Wu and other Chinese and foreign detectives, continuing their investigation into the case, apprehended five more suspects from Jurong County: Dai Hongfu, Chen Hesheng, Chen Bosheng, Qiao Changjin, and Chen Qiaosheng, at locations including 444 and 459 North Shaanxi Road, and 340 and 349 Shandong Road. They were handed over to the First Special District Court. After questioning, Chen Qiaosheng was found to be uninvolved and was released on bail. Dai Hongfu and the other four were detained for further investigation. (Due to the extreme importance of the case, the police wanted to arrest more gang members, so the hearing was closed to the public and no announcements were made.) It wasn't until yesterday morning that Judge Huang Risheng held an open trial in the Second Criminal Court, questioning Dai Hongfu and the others. The four defendants firmly insisted that they had not participated in the crime and had come to Shanghai to seek refuge last August. Judge Huang questioned the four defendants separately for a long time, but their statements remained consistent, steadfastly denying any involvement. He ordered them remanded in custody, pending review by the Supreme Court.

### Russian Drunk Blocks Car, Beats Wang Simo; Rickshaw Puller Seriously Injured; Perpetrator Detained Pending Trial; Wang, President of the Second Special District Local Court of This City

It is reported that on the 1st of this month at noon, Mr. Wang Simo, president of the Second Special District Local Court of this city, attended a banquet hosted by Western friends. At 2:00 PM, he boarded his private car, hospital number 857, driven by Yao Yunfu, a rickshaw puller from Ningbo, to return to his residence at No. 6, Lane 79, Huanlong Road. As the car entered Lane 79 on Huanlong Road, at the entrance of the second alley, three drunken Russians, including one named Ivan Sintsov (transliteration), stood in front of the car, preventing the rickshaw puller Yao Yunfu from getting out. They questioned him harshly and cursed him.

They then punched him violently,

causing injuries. Judge Wang also got out of the car and, speaking in English, questioned Ivan Sintsov, who then punched Wang in the left forehead, shattering his platinum-rimmed glasses. Police officers arrived and arrested the Russian, taking him to the police station for investigation. Yesterday afternoon, he was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Qiu Huanxing presided over the hearing. Lawyer Fei Xizhen, representing the French Concession authorities, stated the case,

Prosecuting him for assault.

He also noted that the defendant had previously been convicted of assault and sentenced to 60 yuan. The injured rickshaw puller, Yao Yunfu, was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by the police due to his serious injuries and was therefore not present in court. Detectives then reported the results of their investigation. Ivan Sintsov, 31 years old, a Russian resident of No. 1331 Yu Yuan Road, testified that on that day, he saw the car

Driving into the alley.

He raised his hand, but the driver not only did not stop but continued forward, so he went forward to hit the driver. The person sitting in the car got out to help the driver and wanted to hit him, so he also punched him, etc. The witnesses, friends of the defendant Trofimnina (transliteration), a Russian, and Pierre (transliteration), a Belgian, testified, largely siding with the defendant. The court reviewed the testimony and ordered the defendant to be detained, with a continued hearing scheduled for the 12th.

### Coal Delivery Leads to Murder; Police File Charges; Suspect Chen Asi Arrested; Autopsy Required for Further Review

It is reported that at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, Li Jingshi, the Ningbo owner of Jiuda Coal Shop at No. 11 Park Road, instructed his fellow townsman Chen Xiaji, 31 years old and a shop assistant, to deliver one and a half dan of coal to a resident at No. 265, Lane 590, Haining Road. A dispute arose due to a shortage of two jin in the weight, and Chen Asi, a worker from Danyang, and several companions beat him up. After returning to the shop, Chen Xiaji suddenly felt severe abdominal pain around 10:00 PM and was rushed to Baolong Hospital, where he died. The hospital reported the incident to the Shanghai Municipal Police, who sent detectives to arrest Chen Asi and bring him to the police station. The deceased's body was transported to the morgue. Yesterday morning, the suspect Chen was sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that Chen Xiaji's body had been inspected by the court's prosecutor and a forensic doctor, who determined that an autopsy was required. He requested a postponement. Judge Huang Risheng questioned Chen Asi briefly and ordered him remanded in custody, with a continued hearing scheduled for another day.

### Japanese Army Search; Villager Shot Dead; Several Others Arrested

Due to the fact that a Japanese military police squad leader was attacked and injured in Caohuo Town, west of Shanghai, Japanese troops have been conducting strict searches of the town's surrounding villages, often late at night or early in the morning. However, these searches have only resulted in fruitless journeys and disturbed residents. Around 3:00 AM the night before last, a large contingent of Japanese soldiers raided Yangjia Port and Caojiazhai, east of the town. They stormed into the home of farmer Cao Xizhang. Cao's daughter-in-law, Ms. Wu, hearing the sudden arrival of Japanese soldiers, hurriedly climbed out of bed in a daze and escaped through the window to hide in a ditch next to a bamboo grove. Unfortunately, she was spotted by the Japanese soldiers, who, without asking any questions, opened fire, killing her with a bullet. By the time the mistake was realized, it was already too late. The Japanese soldiers then arrested several villagers, including Yang Xiaomao and his son, from Yangjia Port and are currently detaining them at the Japanese military headquarters in Longhua for investigation.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Concert

The Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra will hold its twelfth symphony concert of the season at the Lyceum Theatre on Sunday, the 8th of this month, at 5:15 PM. The program includes four pieces, including a symphony. Ticket prices remain the same (two types: $1.10 and $0.55).

### Two Japanese Disregard the Law, Vandalize Tobacco Shop, Assault Police Officer; Arrested and Detained by Police; Will Be Prosecuted in Japanese Consular Court

According to the North China Daily News, two Japanese men in plain clothes vandalized a part of a certain Xiaobing exchange shop at No. 497 Sichuan Road last night (the 4th) and assaulted a Chinese traffic police officer. A Western police chief from the Central Police Station rushed to the scene and attempted to arrest them, but they resisted. The reported details are as follows: At around 11:20 PM, two Japanese men entered the shop, smashed the glass on the counter, broke the glass on the door to the inner room, and overturned tables and furniture. A traffic police officer attempted to intervene, but the Japanese men attacked him, tearing his coat and pulling off one of the white traffic sleeves. The sleeve was later found, crumpled and worn, in the pocket of one of the Japanese men's coats. When a Western police chief attempted to stop them, the collar of his coat was also slightly torn. After much argument and resistance, the two Japanese men were taken to the Central Police Station in a police van and placed in cells. A Japanese detective learned the details and investigated the situation, and notified the police department of the Japanese consulate. It is reported that the police will prosecute the two Japanese men in the Japanese consular court for intentional damage and assault of a police officer.

### Robbers Steal Truck; Whereabouts Unknown

Yesterday at approximately 6:10 PM, a vacant truck with registration number 23018 was traveling north on Xinzha Road near Wenzhou Road when four bandits suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two of the bandits, wielding firearms, threatened the driver and ordered him to stop. The driver, seeing that there was no way to avoid it, stopped the truck. The bandits boarded the truck and ordered the driver to turn onto Xinzha Road and drive west. The driver, watched by the bandits, had no choice but to obey. Unexpectedly, at the intersection of Hart Road, the bandits told the driver to stop and pushed him out of the car, then drove off themselves, speeding northwest. The driver, helpless, rushed to the local police station to report the incident. The police immediately ordered detectives to investigate and search for the truck, but as of midnight, the truck had not been found.

### Explanation of "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" [Cessation of Gonorrhea], A Savior for Gonorrhea Patients

In 1919, Pasulfamide was discovered as a raw medicine, but it was not noticed by others. In 1936, it was found that this raw medicine could treat various diseases caused by hemolytic streptococcus and meningitis bacteria. In May 1937, Reuters (Dr. Rentes), Dr. Deses, and Dr. Colston suddenly issued a surprising report stating that Pasulfamide could treat gonorrhea, with unprecedented bactericidal power and no side effects. It could be used widely and was easily absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and quickly excreted in urine. The medical community paid great attention to this and widely used it. The results were the same as those reported by Reuters. The medical community then embarked on a trend of trying Pasulfamide, and they were proud to publish news about this medicine. Some busybodies even tried to find fault with this medicine, hoping to increase their reputation, but after two or three years of nitpicking, it turned out that this medicine had no harmful effect on the human body when treating gonorrhea. Therefore, its use became more widespread. The results of the trial were consistent with the reports made by Reuters. Reuters reported that (Pasulfamide) treated gonorrhea with a success rate of over 90% in five days, and many cases were cured in two days. Peking Union Medical College has also adopted (Pasulfamide). According to Dr. Chen Kuan, director of the Department of Pharmacology at Peking Union Medical College, this raw medicine, Pasulfamide, is often referred to as "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" (Cessation of Gonorrhea), which he considers very appropriate. This medicine is indeed an unprecedented and effective treatment for gonorrhea and can be widely used. He believes that this medicine is easier to use than 606 for syphilis, because 606 contains a strong toxicity. Syphilis patients cannot use it unless injected by a doctor. However, "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" is different. 606 can only be injected, while "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" can be taken internally and is non-toxic. The discovery of this "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" by the medical community can be said to be a savior for gonorrhea patients. "Xin Le De Neng" is a pill made with "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" as the main agent and supplemented with other carefully selected medicines such as concentrated sandalwood oil and copaiba balsam. It can be used to treat gonorrhea, with fast bactericidal action, great medicinal power, pain relief, bowel cleansing, no toxic substances, no harm to the stomach, fast absorption, and quick excretion. There are two types, for men and women, so that the different physical conditions of men and women are fully considered. It is thorough and safe and is a major invention that will benefit mankind greatly. This new drug "Xin Le De Neng" is exclusively managed by New Star Unlimited Company and is officially released today. The future prospects are very promising.

### Real Estate Dispute in Lafayette New Village; Real Estate Company Applies for Auction; Divorced Wife of Owner Raises Objection; Review Pending Submission of Rent Account

Chen Dimin, a wealthy businessman from Anhui who once worked as a compradore for a foreign company, lived with Tan Kunfan, a woman from Suzhou, out of love. They later married and had seven or eight children. However, Chen became acquainted with a prostitute named Wu Luo'e and lived with her, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. Chen and Tan's marriage also suffered because of Wu, and two years ago Tan filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court for separation, eventually filing for divorce and seeking 70,000 yuan in alimony. The initial judgment granted the divorce and ordered Chen to pay Tan 20,000 yuan in alimony. The second instance appeal changed the alimony to 15,000 yuan, but the divorce was still granted. The case is currently on appeal to the third instance. When Chen and Tan were in love, they jointly established Lafayette New Village real estate. Chen later mortgaged the property to Hengye Real Estate Company. Now, because of overdue payments, Hengye Company filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against Chen to recover the mortgage debt. A judgment was issued ordering him to repay 258,000 yuan. The creditor, Hengye Real Estate Company, has applied to the court to execute the auction of Lafayette New Village real estate. Chen and Tan Kunfan have retained lawyers Xue Jiaqi and others to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District against Hengye Real Estate Company and Chen Dimin, raising objections to the execution. Yesterday morning, Judge Ma Yishu opened the Seventh Civil Court to hear the case. The three parties were represented by their lawyers. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the Lafayette New Village real estate was built jointly by the plaintiff and the defendant Chen Dimin, each owning one-half. From April 1934 to April 1937, the property was mortgaged to Hengye Real Estate Company, with rents being used to pay off the debt. The monthly rent collected was 3,380 yuan. Based on the past market rent collection, after deducting interest, there should be a remaining balance of over 10,000 yuan. After deducting the mortgage loan, Chen only owes about 210,000 yuan. Because the market rent has increased since the war last year, the remainder would be even greater after deducting interest. However, the lawyer representing the defendant, Hengye Real Estate Company, stated that the total mortgage debt owed was over 280,000 yuan and there was no surplus rent to pay off the debt. Chen Dimin's lawyer also made a statement. The court, noting that the dispute was over the rent account, ordered Hengye Real Estate Company to submit the rent account for review and rescheduled the hearing for the 19th of this month.

### Student Economic Dormitory Organized by YWCA Ready to Open on the 10th

The Shanghai Christian Educational Association and the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), commissioned by the Shanghai Student Relief Committee, are now managing a student economic dormitory on the 7th and 8th floors of the Wuzhou Building on Fuzhou Road, specifically for male and female students from impoverished families. The boys are managed by the Educational Association, and the girls are managed by the YWCA. Regarding fees, because the dormitory is for relief purposes, students only pay six yuan per month, with the rest subsidized by the Student Relief Committee and the two associations. The dormitory is equipped with beds, chairs, desks, etc., each person having their own. There are also libraries, lounges, bathrooms, washrooms, etc., so that impoverished students can reduce the burden of accommodation expenses while acquiring good living habits. However, because the dormitory is for the relief of impoverished students, the restrictions are somewhat strict. Students applying for accommodation must have a letter of certification from the principal of their school and submit a volunteer form and investigation form. Only after review and approval can they be admitted to the dormitory. Due to limited space, the dormitory cannot accommodate a large number of students. Currently, it only accepts 60 male and female students each. Preparations are now complete, and registration begins today. Move-in is scheduled for the 10th of this month. To request regulations and registration information, contact the Educational Association in Eight Immortals Bridge or the Student Department of the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road.

### Letter

To the Editor:

In the January 5th issue of your newspaper, an article titled "Transportation Company Owner Accused of Fraud and Obtaining Property" incorrectly printed "Defendant Sun Jianshi sentenced to three months imprisonment for fraud, bail of 500 yuan" as "sentenced Xu Xuechang to three months imprisonment for fraud" in the concluding paragraph. Fearing misunderstandings in the outside world, I request that you make a correction.

Sincerely,

Xu Xuechang

### "Talking Nonsense"

—

The phrase "talking nonsense" was originally used by prostitutes to reject requests from patrons. It seems shallow and somewhat incoherent, but its meaning is profound: it contains belittling the other party and despising their intentions, so it is also a synonym for "arrogance" or "dreaming."

Friends who go to prostitutes pay a considerable price to find a certain person. We don't need to investigate their actual intentions. Are they elegant or filthy? At a minimum, they hope to get a smile from the other person, the so-called "buying a smile with a thousand pieces of gold" should be one of the goals. However, some of those prostitutes deliberately show off their value, refusing to smile easily, while others are ashamed and dare not say much, sitting coldly on the side, only answering when asked. Buyers in this situation will naturally feel bored. To achieve the goal of prostitution and harmonize the atmosphere, they have to come up with many exaggerated, ancient, and filthy words to stir the other person's heart and induce a charming smile. Therefore, their attitudes are inevitably frivolous, and their words are inevitably mean. The other party knows that they are being insulted and ridiculed, but due to their status, they cannot quarrel or argue, and can only treat it as a dream and warn them: "Don't talk nonsense!" rejecting them completely.

The people of Shanghai are very smart. They are not only highly absorbent but also very quick to spread things. At the same time, there are too many friends and facts of "talking nonsense," so this sentence quickly became popular in all levels of society.

Now, any excessive demands, exaggerated statements, and unreasonable arguments can be met with the reply: "Don't talk nonsense!"

In fact, there are many friends and facts of "talking nonsense" in general society, and this trend also prevails in the international arena. However, only the shameless, lowly, weak-willed, and confused people will fall for it.

### Scene of the New Year Cake Market

— Simon

During the Christmas season, the New Year cake market had already opened. Once the Gregorian New Year arrived, the New Year cake market seemed to be stimulated and became particularly lively. From the mooncake market to the crab market, and from the crab market to the New Year cake market, metabolism occurs, with each season having its own seasonal foods. Merchants never forget the seasons.

Perhaps the most popular in the New Year cake market is Ningbo New Year cake. Many people who make New Year cakes rent half a storefront, set up a rectangular table, and several cake makers are busy kneading and making Ningbo New Year cakes all day long.

The method for making Ningbo New Year cakes is very simple. Grind glutinous rice with water, steam it, beat it in a stone mortar, knead it until sticky on the table, and then put it in a mold to print into strips of New Year cake. Therefore, in front of every New Year cake stall, there is always a sign that reads "Top Quality Water-Ground New Year Cake."

Although it is only half a storefront, the rent is expensive this year, costing tens of dollars a month. Fortunately, the price of rice is not expensive, so making rice cakes is still a good short-term business. From the winter solstice to the Lunar New Year's Eve, in previous years, the New Year cake market only lasted for 30 to 40 days, but this year, the period from the winter solstice to the Lunar New Year's Eve is a full two months long. The New Year cake market has been extended invisibly. Coupled with the crowding of residents on the isolated island, the sales volume of New Year cakes will inevitably be higher than in previous years, so New Year cake stalls are particularly lively, with one every three steps and one every five steps.

Currently, the market price of New Year cakes is 17 jin per yuan. Although it is only one stall, some people can make several thousand yuan in business during the two-month New Year cake market. The workers who make New Year cakes are not necessarily from Ningbo, with locals accounting for the majority. Each person's salary ranges from over ten yuan to over twenty yuan per month. In addition to New Year cakes, some stalls also sell New Year cake dumplings in the morning. They use steamed cake flour, add some red bean paste and dried fruit to make filling, and knead it into New Year cake dumplings. The business is also not bad.

Not only are there temporary New Year cake stalls, but cake shops are also busy making Ningbo New Year cakes these days. Ningbo New Year cake can be stir-fried with shredded pork as a snack, and it can also be used in cooking. Not only do people from Ningbo love to eat it, but people from all over Shanghai now love to eat it. Therefore, Ningbo New Year cake is available year-round in Shanghai, but it is especially lively during the New Year cake season at the end of the year.

In addition to Ningbo New Year cakes, Suzhou-style and Cantonese-style sugar New Year cakes are also quite popular in Shanghai. Sugar New Year cakes are made with glutinous rice. These days, look at any tea shop, dry goods store, or cake shop on Nanjing Road, and you'll see they are all piled high with sugar New Year cakes, both meat and vegetarian, white sugar and brown sugar, rose-flavored and egg yolk-flavored, lard-flavored and bean paste-flavored, with a wide variety of styles too numerous to list. Guan Sheng Yuan and Tai Kang have also displayed Cantonese-style lard New Year cakes in their windows, and there are also various New Year cake boxes. The four major companies have also opened separate sections to sell New Year cakes.

There are also Gaoqiao New Year cakes, Shaoxing New Year cakes, and many other styles, but they are not as popular as the Ningbo New Year cakes and Suzhou-style and Cantonese-style sugar New Year cakes mentioned above. Facts tell us that New Year cake is a huge expense for the Lunar New Year. And this is not the only huge expense, so we still use the same old words to ask that "every single person on the isolated island should never forget 'disaster relief through thrift' at any time and in any place."

### A World of Terror

— Li Zhihua

(IAMTheLaw)

Produced by Columbia, Shown at the Grand Light Theater

To put it simply, it's an old story. This is a film comparable to gMEN. In other words, it is one of the products of the American government's film policy to suppress bandits and stabilize society. Can such a superficial approach really eliminate bandits? Can it really stabilize society? This is a question (my answer is definitely no), but it is a fact that we have seen many similar films under the "Blue Eagle" film policy.

"A World of Terror" tells the story of John, a law professor with an inherently upright character and hatred for evil, and how he sacrifices his vacation to help the government in its work to stabilize society. I like this story. My liking does not lie in how he exerts himself to eliminate thugs – the purpose of the production is to appeal to "law professors with inherently upright characters, asking them to come forward and cooperate with the government to stabilize society." If the location is changed to Shanghai, here and now, if we change our perspective and view it with a spirit of not fearing violence and fighting to the end, it may not be without some significance. Yes, resolutely fighting against the violent is a very good subject. What I like is the screenwriter's creative method of writing from a positive perspective, and John's inherently upright character, determined to move forward bravely and overcome all difficulties. Motivated by such a firm character, and because the author writes about him from a positive perspective, he gives people the courage to fight against the violent. Of course, the producers' purpose was not for us on the "isolated island" at this time and place, and the development of the story inevitably has too many "coincidences," but a play shown in a certain place at a certain time is inseparable from time and space, just like Rock's "Professor of Antiques." The film itself is not a film that insults China, but we will not forget that he starred in the films "Daredevil" and "One Million a Year" which insulted China. We should ask about the producer's purpose of a film, but we should also point out its objective effect. Those with superficial knowledge may think that this is talking about things outside the film, but we firmly believe that this is really "within the scope" of the film.

Now let's turn the topic to the performance aspects of "A World of Terror."

I like the directing of this film. Alexander Hall is very capable of clearly and powerfully controlling the progress of the play. He understands the compilation of the script, so he can uniformly express the center of gravity of the play. I certainly do not agree with the basis of a play being placed on one person, so that the development of the play is due to the development of this character, and the background he is in is instead subordinate to him, but in this play, it cannot be denied that there are its advantages, that is, as I said above, the author positively sculpts (not describes) an upright and firm character, and such a character is what moves us and increases our courage to fight against the violent.

The director's strength is that he fully promotes this advantage: and in the subtle places, such as that Professor John often puts his burning pipe in his pocket, causing the pocket to smoke, and uses dogs to hinder the thugs from stimulating the audience.

The parts that are too "coincidental" are due to the script, such as the thugs breaking into the house, and John happening to go to get a gun. Ferguson's suicide by jumping in front of a car is because his son Paul's "superb legal skills, mature for his age" "human touch" is at play, as the explanation says: "For the sake of maintaining the reputation of his beloved son Paul, the screenwriter must both 'eliminate bandits and stabilize society' for the film policy and 'sacrifice one's relatives for the greater good,' and also maintain the reputation of his beloved son Paul," naturally resigning himself to such a tragic end.

Edward G. Robinson's acting is good, experienced and stable, just like the various films he has acted in before, especially the use of both hands, fully demonstrating his power, and his pronunciation and facial expressions are even better.

### Correction

In the article "Auspicious Signs of the New Year" by Sang Zijun published on the 2nd, the character "佳" (auspicious) in the title and the text was mistakenly printed as "結" (knot). This is hereby corrected.

### Preface to the Ballads of North and South

Yuan Yin: The talents of poets and scholars are stirring in Shanghai. The north of Shanghai is known for its opulence and decadence. Mr. Yan has compiled "Ballads of North Shanghai," describing the scenery of the northern district. Now, a special edition is being published to be shared with the world. Calling Shanghai its home, the city is made of earthly flowers, the moon is a building, singing is solicited at doors, and wine is consumed everywhere until dusk. Yet, it still originates from the city. Since Westerners engaged in commerce, mountains and hills have been transformed, and grand buildings have been erected. Night trees are numbered, spring goods are the focus, economics are discussed, and wandering youths are everywhere. At that time, unemployment was a given, and over the past ten years, the changes have been significant. Those who see through the illusion cannot help but feel sentimental. This poem by Shao Jun is like a record of the pleasure district and the life of courtesans. Written in the early summer of the Bingzi year of Guangxu.

As mentioned above, the book "Ballads of North and South" introduces quite a few surnames of female ballad singers, all of whom were important figures in the female ballad singing scene at the time. Volume 4 of "Miscellaneous Records of the Universe" contains an article entitled "Preface to the Western-style Courtesans," which records many names. Here are the names listed:

Jiang Qinlan, Fang Qiu, Chen Chaoyun, Zhou Ai, Chen Daixiang, Chuan Yueqing, Zhou Yueqing, Zhu Lanqing, Zhu Shaoqing, Zhu Rongqing, Zhu Wenqing, Lu Xiuqing, Zhu Suqing, Wang Yixiang, Wu Suqing, Zhu Xueqing, Zhu Yuqing, Wang Baoqing, Huang Aiqing, Jin Youqing, Fang Aiqing, Fang Shaoqing, Xu Peiqing, Huang Baoqing, Ye Xiuqing, Zhu Xiangqing, Zhu Fengjuan, Yu Fengzhen, Zhu Sulan, Zhu Youlan, Zhu Ruilan, Li Peilan, Yuan Yuexian, Chuan Yuexian, Shen Yuechun, Yuan Xuelan, Yuan Yunxian, Wang Youjuan, Wang Shaojuan, Li Qinxian, Zhang Xuezhen, Chen Zhixiang, Chen Yuee, Chen Yuezhen, Chen Yuefang, Li Huifang, Wang Yueqin, Jin Sujuan, Jiang Yuee, Jiang Yuejuan.

The preface involves fifty female ballad singers, which shows how prosperous the "courtesans" were in Shanghai at that time. There were also female ballad singers in Suzhou, but the prosperity was far less than in Shanghai. According to Wang’s research, "The opening of the Shanghai courtesans began with Zhu Sulan. Those who followed Sulan were Zhou Ruixian and Yan Lizhen." This is also sufficient for verification. In addition, what is also worth mentioning is the location of these types of courtesans. According to the "Notes of Touring Shanghai" by the Lean Crane Poet, "They all live in the East He Xing, West He Xing, East Hui Fang, West Hui Fang, East Gong He, West Gong He, Shang Ren Li, Tao Yuan Li, Zhao Fu, Zhao Gui, Ri Xin, Jiu An, Pu Qing, and Tong Qing in the middle of Shi Road, as well as Qing He Fang, Gong Yang Li, Zhao Rong Li, and Gui Xin Li." The area is also very wide, and its main purpose is no longer "literature." (End of this section)

### Twice Passed Qing

— Bao Tian

Chapter 1: One-Armed Elder Organizes a Free Village, Twin Sisters Reverently Visit the Tombs of Martyrs

Let's talk about the private school established by Zhu Laoyuan. His teaching methods were not in line with the emerging school regulations. He was essentially putting on a one-man show, flailing around without anyone to help him. Later, the county sent an inspector, who naturally found the school neither like a proper school nor like a traditional private school. Of course, this was wrong, and that was wrong. If you were to pick at it, nothing would be right. The inspector believed that elementary school teachers should have some education, so he asked Zhu Laoyuan, "What school are you from?" Zhu Laoyuan widened his eyes and said, "What school am I from? I'm from the school of carrying a hoe and digging mud. I don't want to teach any books. Why do you only open schools in the city and not open elementary schools in the countryside? Are the villagers supposed to be ignorant and not deserve to study? It's easy enough to collect donations from the villagers, with fancy names like education surcharges, but what benefits do the villagers actually get?" The inspector was taken aback by his rebuff and had nothing to say. Later, several villages were merged, and an elementary school was established. However, some people still wanted Zhu Laoyuan to teach the children in the village, but Zhu Laoyuan declined, saying, "I'm not good enough after all. Before, there were no schools near the village, and I saw the children just running around in the fields and cemeteries, with no one to care for them. I felt that it was always beneficial for a person to know a few words, so I took in a few students to teach. But my own knowledge is limited. Now that there is an elementary school, it's better to go to the elementary school. Although it's a bit further away, country children aren't afraid of running." Even though he didn't teach, he still went to the small teahouse. This small teahouse was their gathering place and their place of discussion. It continued until 1937, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the village was occupied. All the small teahouses and the entire village were burned to the ground. Zhu Laoyuan led a group of young people in the village to form a guerrilla隊, fighting the enemy forces. On one occasion, he led a team of his strong young subordinates, more than forty people, along a certain railway line, intending to cut off the enemy's rear and seize their supplies and weapons. It was a dark and windy night, with some light rain. They had pre-dug up six or seven zhang of the railway track and sent people to ambush on all sides. At a signal, the ambushing forces rose up together, catching the enemy soldiers off guard. However, this time, victory was achieved, but our loyal uncle's country teacher, Zhu Laoyuan, was seriously injured. (5)

### Finance: London Pure Gold Sets New Record High: £7 10s 5d; Local Spot Price Declines Against the Trend

Yesterday's spot silver futures market situation was unpredictable. Generally, the underlying trend initially fell and then rose, eventually falling again. Initially, the London pure gold price repeatedly reached new highs, but it did not arouse the excitement of buyers because the foreign exchange rate tended to be looser. Therefore, the price then declined. Later, the buying interest from the Hong Kong syndicate became stronger, and a certain money exchange business instructed to buy more than 200 taels. At the same time, the securities syndicate also collected a little, causing the price to rise again. In the end, a certain kind of atmosphere was rumored in the market, causing people's hearts to suddenly become fatigued, and the selling atmosphere suddenly became strong. Moreover, the selling intention of a certain gold shop was indeed more eager than others, so the price repeated its downstream movement. However, there were many turns in the middle, but there were no major waves. However, as a result, it only fell by 4 yuan compared to the closing price on Saturday night. People's hearts in all quarters were uncertain, and the transaction was still strong, about 700 taels in the morning and slightly less than 200 taels in the afternoon.

Spot Silver Futures Fall by 4 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar of ten taels initially had strong confidence. Later, it was heard that the underlying trend of the foreign exchange rate tended to be stronger after the opening, causing people's hearts to gradually move downstream. A certain money exchange business called for selling at 2,005 yuan, but those who wanted to buy were all watching from the sidelines. It was not until the price was called down to 1,995 yuan that buyers were seen. First, a certain money exchange business bought on behalf of the Hong Kong syndicate, purchasing 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate at a price of 1,995 yuan, which was the opening price. Then, it purchased 100 taels from the spot silver futures firm at a price of 94 yuan. During this period, the foreign exchange rate was slightly reported as looser, and the Hong Kong syndicate also stopped buying and watched from the sidelines. The price then fell, with the spot silver futures firm selling 50 taels to another money exchange business at a price of 93 yuan, and another 50 taels to a money exchange business at 91 yuan. The gold shop syndicate sold 50 taels to another money exchange business at a price of 90 yuan. Later, the syndicate took advantage of the low price and entrusted a certain money exchange business to buy on its behalf, purchasing 50 taels each from the spot silver futures firm and the money shop syndicate, both at a price of 90 yuan. At the same price, another money exchange business purchased 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate. After this, there were more buyers, and the price then hovered and rose again. The money exchange business purchased 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate at a price of 93 yuan. A certain money exchange business then purchased 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate at a price of 94 yuan. Another money exchange business purchased 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate at a price of 94 yuan. A certain money exchange business then purchased 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate at a price of 96 yuan. During this period, a certain gold shop suddenly developed a selling intention, selling 50 taels to the securities syndicate at a price of 96 yuan, which was the highest price, and then selling 50 taels to the money exchange business at a price of 94 yuan, and then selling 50 taels to the money exchange business at a price of 95 yuan, and then selling 50 taels to the gold shop syndicate at a price of 93 yuan. The money exchange businesses did 50 taels among themselves at a price of 94 yuan. Finally, the money exchange business purchased 50 taels from the gold shop at a price of 95 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, trading became sparse, and around 2:30 p.m., it was again heard that the foreign exchange rate was looser, so the price trended weakly again. The money exchange businesses did 30 taels among themselves at a price of 93 yuan. After this, supply and demand became even more scarce. Then, after 3:20 p.m., a certain kind of atmosphere suddenly spread in the market, causing the selling wind to become even stronger. A certain gold shop was indeed more eager than others, so the price then broke into the 90-yuan level. A certain gold shop strongly sold more than 100 taels, all at a price of 88 yuan, all of which were taken in by a certain money exchange business on behalf of foreign banks. The final closing price for the evening was still 1,988 yuan, a drop of 4 yuan compared to the closing price before the holiday on Saturday. The full-day difference was 8 yuan. The selling price of the spot silver futures firm's brand gold was 1,995 yuan, and the purchase price was 1,988 yuan. The current bid gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were no trades opened.

The Exchange Rate of Ornament Gold Does Not Move

The exchange price of gold jewelry in gold shops remains unchanged. The old Qingyun and other shops of the Great Guild still suspend the original price of 202 yuan, and the new shops suspend 200 yuan and call in 198 yuan.

Pure Gold Rises Sharply and Unceasingly

London, 4th: The price of English pure gold continued to rise sharply, with each ounce unexpectedly rising by another 4 and a half pence, breaking the high of 7 pounds 10 shillings on November 26 of last year, and setting a new high of 7 pounds 10 shillings 5 pence. It was found that it rose a total of 11 and a half pence during the holiday, causing the Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold to also rise to 1,227 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold also rose sharply by 1 cent and 1 li, reaching 2 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen 7 li. The Shanghai standard bid gold price also rose by 7 yuan and 8 jiao, reaching 1,223 yuan and 2 jiao, all of which were new highs that had never been reached since the market opened.

### Foreign Currencies Plummet Following the Price of Gold

After the silver and money businesses completed the year-end closing of accounts and the New Year's Day holiday, they opened for business yesterday. During the holiday period, the price of English pure gold rose by a total of 11 pence and a half, and the exchange rates of English and American currencies fell by a total of 1 point 83125. The English and American exchange rates were frequently filled with foreign wires, the banks' absorption was not smooth, and the market price was loose and unstable. The trend was firm, and the opening was a bright spot, but before long, a reaction suddenly arose, and retail investors rose one after another to leave the market, plummeting step by step. The market became increasingly weak, and foreign currencies also followed the trend and loosened. The guild transactions were not opened. Yesterday's market price was lower than the closing price at the end of the year, with English gold bills falling by 2 jiao, American gold bills falling by 3 fen, Hong Kong bills falling by 1 fen, French franc bills falling by 2 li, Singapore bills and Dutch bills each falling by 2 fen, Canadian bills falling by 5 fen, Philippine bills falling by 1 fen, Australian gold bills falling by 1 jiao, and other currencies remaining unchanged.

### Short-Term Large Silver Falls, Indian Silver Rises Again

London, 4th: Speculators and Citibank merchants sold, and then speculators suddenly came to re-enter long-term positions, and the market situation was still flat. After the closing, the market situation was quiet and dull, and there was a great lack of entrants. The near-term large silver price fell by 1875, and the far-term price remained unchanged. New York silver wire: The price of American silver still has a market but no transaction. Bombay silver wire: The Indian silver market situation is still firm, and both spot and near-term and far-term prices continue to rise by 4 annas.

### Discount Turns Flat

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts hovered around the 40 yuan mark per thousand yuan all day, and finally settled at 39 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, a slight drop of 2 jiao 5 fen compared to the day before the holiday (the 21st).

### Foreign Telegrams and Western Merchants Force Selling; Exchange Market Remains Loose

Yesterday, the exchange market trended towards loosening and instability due to repeated competition to sell by foreign telegrams from Hong Kong and Little Luzon and local Western merchants such as Sassoon. Although foreign firms and speculative merchants such as yarn and flower gangs piled up in the middle, the trend was unaffected because the banks were still selling and the Chinese financial situation was becoming more stable due to the collapse of the Konoe Cabinet in Japan. Trading was also brisk throughout the day.

At the beginning of the morning, the London large silver price was short-term reduced and long-term flat, and the New York spot price remained unchanged. The exchange rate of English against American returned to a large score, against the French rose by 12 centimes, against Shanghai flat. The US dollar was one-sixth of a point long against the British pound, up 4375 against the French, and unchanged against Shanghai. The central listing of various exchange rates remained the same as before. The selling price of spot exchange by banks in the early morning was 8 pence 46875 for English exchange and 16 yuan 375 for American exchange, a slight drop of 03125 for English flat and American compared to the previous Saturday (i.e., before the holiday), because during the close of the market, the English-American exchange rate was reduced by 1 cent 1 li 6 to 1 point 3125. After the opening, foreign telegrams from places such as Hong Kong and Little Luzon were selling quite hard, the yarn and flower gangs took a little bit, and the banks' intake was not strong, causing the process to become increasingly difficult. The English gold price rose to above 8 pence and a half, the American gold price traded over 16 yuan and a half, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also loosened to 56 yuan 875. When the HSBC listing was announced and remained unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was announced at 10.25%, although speculators piled up, the banks were still selling, and the Western merchant Sassoon's selling intention suddenly became strong, and the money exchange businesses were also strongly selling Hong Kong exchange rates incessantly, so the situation finally became difficult. The closing price at noon was 8 pence 53125 for English gold and 16 yuan 46875 for American gold. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still 56 yuan 875. The following is a list of the transactions opened during the day.

In the later market, due to the continued strong selling by Hong Kong telegrams and the sluggish absorption by banks, the source of supply was smoother than the demand, so although a certain foreign firm settled the piling, the trend was still loose due to the fact that the supply of head positions exceeded the demand. The English gold price once stiffened to 8 pence 5625. After entering, the trading gradually became clear, with only money exchange businesses and others doing Hong Kong exchange trading, so it was slightly flat. The closing selling prices of banks in the evening were 8 pence 546875 for English exchange, 16 yuan and a half for American exchange, and still 56 yuan and 875 for Hong Kong exchange. As a result, the English price increased by 078125, the American price stiffened by 09375, and the Hong Kong exchange rate increased by 125 compared to the previous Saturday (i.e., before the holiday). The following is a record of the transactions opened on a day.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Reverses From Falling to Rising; Types A, B, C, and D All Increase by One Yuan Each; Foreign Debt Unanimously Returns Small Due to Certain Influence

Yesterday, the securities futures market was the first day of the New Year's red market, and there was a four-day holiday in the middle. The political shocks were quite strong. The absurd telegram from Jingwei had no effect, and the market's sentiment had become relatively stable. When the futures market first opened, large long positions deliberately spread rumors, saying that there might be changes in the payment of interest, or that 500 million new construction bonds would be issued. General blind followers did not consider it, and several firms followed the number one, competing to sell first. The opening price was actually as much as one yuan lower than before the year. Lemao Firm absorbed the most, and various syndicate retail investors also bought in one after another. No. 38 raised the price quite sharply, and the market price actually turned higher very quickly. The results before noon were gains without losses. In the afternoon, general short sellers knew that they had been deceived, and they all covered their positions, and the rising wind suddenly became fierce, especially with No. 5 and Tongkang Firm searching the most violently. The price then rose sharply, and Type A unexpectedly broke through the highest price of 62 yuan 1 jiao on December 24 of last year and saw a new record of 62 yuan 4 jiao, a huge difference of 2 yuan between the high and low. This kind of change from falling to rising was completely a means of both buying and selling parties. Therefore, the shape of ninety-six, which had not been raised or lowered for a long time, was also turning better. According to the current environment and observations of people's hearts, it should be mostly on the rise, but it is also slightly suspected of being too violent. As a result, all rose by one yuan to one yuan, three jiao and five fen, and ninety-six also rose by half a yuan, and the total transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below. The stock market has not yet opened.

London's Chinese Foreign Price on January 3, 28 (Tuesday) Hongshu's listed market price was unanimously reduced due to the impact of China's political development, falling from one pound cattle to half a pound. English continued to borrow English bonds, and the same fell by four pounds because the early-month lottery period had arrived (usually only a reduction of two or three pounds or so after the lottery), and the price was seventy-four pounds. English-issued bonds for the rehabilitation public debt also fell by four pounds for the same reason (interest for half a year should be two pounds and a half), and the price was fifty-four pounds. The Huguang Railway Public Debt non-German-issued bonds fell by one pound and a half, and the price was twenty-four pounds. German-issued bonds with printed bonds also fell by one pound, and the price was twenty-two pounds and a half. The Daoqing Railway Public Debt Railway fell by one pound, and the price was twenty-six pounds. All public debts of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway fell by one pound. The original loans were seventeen pounds each, and the continued loans were sixteen pounds each. The Vickers Aviation Bond fell by fifteen shillings, and the price was thirteen pounds. The Christie's Public Debt and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Public Debt each fell by half a pound, with the former priced at thirty-six pounds and a half and the latter priced at twenty-four pounds.

Also on January 4 (Wednesday), the listed market price was raised by two pounds on English and German continued loans English-issued bonds, and the price was seventy-six pounds. English-French loans English-issued bonds fell by one pound, and the price was fifty-five pounds. The Huguang Railway Public Debt continued to fall by one pound and half a pound, with non-German bonds falling by one pound, and the price was twenty-three pounds. The German-issued bonds with printed bonds continued to fall by half a pound, and the price was twenty-two pounds. Due to the New Year, no wires arrived in Shanghai for the supply of physical goods.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Bran Opens Up Two Corners

The market conditions of bran continued the glory of the end of last year. The market price has risen by more than two corners compared to before the holiday. Yesterday, the large package of Fuxin Factory bran was priced at two yuan and nine jiao and a half, and the large package of Fuhe Factory bran was priced at two yuan and seven jiao and a half. The issue of warehouse rent has been decided by the factory to be increased because the warehouse receipts for November of last year have not yet seen shipment, but the market conditions are still less affected. However, the actual sales are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude, and only speculators are inquiring about more than 5,000 packages. Currently, the factory's supply is very small, so the market situation is still stable.

### Yarn and Flowers: Customer Syndicate Bids to Buy; Yarn Market Soars; Suddenly Jumps by Four Yuan to a Huge Nine Yuan; 2,640 Packages Traded

The yarn and flower red market trading began yesterday. The market price is based on the stable foundation of the end of the year, and the price continues to move forward. All yarns suddenly jumped by a huge four yuan to nine yuan, and the price of cotton cloth pieces also rose by two corners. This is because the Chaoshan and Yunnan syndicates in South China have unremitting needs, and the Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo syndicates in East Zhejiang have the same steps. This news was predicted in the newspaper two days ago. Because the procurement of coarse and fine yarns is coming one after another from all parties, people's hearts are very excited, and the market price is soaring. As for the tenacity of the industry, the raw materials are monopolized by a certain party and cannot fall. The factory's cost has increased, and the profits are becoming thinner, so the absorption is endless. Therefore, the daily industry transactions are very lively. At the opening yesterday, because of the New Year's holiday, all parties had the idea of procurement. At the opening, the customer syndicate first entered the market to release prices and purchase, so the market price jumped by five or six yuan. The Yunfu and Shantou syndicates entered strongly, and the Taiwen and Ningbo syndicates followed suit, so the market price became better and better. As a result, the total amount of trade from the syndicates was 2,640 packages. In the afternoon of the previous day, 140 packages were traded, totaling 2,780 packages. The industry and Qing Dynasty: 20-count extra Jincheng rose by 7 yuan, Shuangma rose by 4 yuan cattle, Samsung rose by 9 yuan, Muyang rose by 7 yuan, Shuangqiu rose by 8 yuan, 16-count and 10-count coarse yarns also rose by 4 yuan to 6 yuan. The factory opened 200 packages of 10-count Delishi from Shenxin, priced at 260 yuan. The Chongxin Factory opened 260 packages of 10-count Dafa, priced at 280 yuan. The New China Factory opened 200 packages of 20-count Wuzi, priced at 260 yuan. The Wing On Factory opened 160 packages of 20-count extra Jincheng, priced at 370 yuan. The New Yu Factory opened 150 packages of 20-count Shuangqiu, priced at 359 yuan. The amount of purchases from each syndicate is listed on the left.

The conditions of the Japanese yarn market are slightly tight due to the rising prices of Chinese yarn, and the popularity has increased by one yuan, but the actual demand is still sluggish. The current price of 20-count Shuiyue yarn is 302 yuan, and the price for this month is 301 yuan. The current price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 3 yuan, and the price for this month is 299 yuan.

### The Sale of Yarn is Smooth; The Demand for Raw Cotton from Original Cotton Mills is Increasing; Yao Clothes Have Started Buying 15,000 Bales; No Orders for Foreign Cotton from Chinese Factories Were Heard Yesterday

The cotton business is increasingly developing. The recent sales of cotton yarn and cotton cloth have been smooth and the selling price has turned high. Various factories naturally intend to replenish their raw materials. Therefore, red market transactions are also said to be lively. However, transactions involving white-packed flower coarse velvet cotton still dominate. Yao clothes and fire-engine cotton are the most popular. Tongyi and Chongxin factories purchased a large quantity of Yao clothes as raw materials, purchasing 15,000 bales. Hongzhang and Anda each purchased 500 bales. Therefore, the market price suddenly rose by one yuan. Tonghua also increased by one yuan. However, this product is strong and clean. Only fine velvet cotton is still suppressed by Indian cotton, and the market situation is relatively weak. Japanese factories occasionally adopt it. There are few Tongzhou flowers arriving at the pier, only 880 bales. However, 15,800 bales of Yao flowers have arrived. Xinyu Factory ordered 200 bales of Indian cotton, which is a 32-count raw material, and the selling price is only 88 yuan. It is also reported that the later batches of Yao flowers still have a huge amount arriving in Shanghai, and all procedures have been completed. The source is smooth and there is no problem. Also, yesterday 250 pieces of cotton arrived from Xingang, 404 pieces from Beisha, and 350 pieces from Baimao Yanglin. The current prices and quantities of spot cotton sold by various parties are as follows:

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The US cotton market in New York was initially weaker due to the completion of some profit-taking in the morning, falling by five or six points. Later, due to President Roosevelt's message, except for a few minor revisions to the issue of farmers in the future, the rest will be implemented according to the original plan. Therefore, the minds of the industry have become more firm. Spot transactions and the purchases of various factories still show signs of progress. Yesterday, New York fell by two or three points, Indian spot and future prices fell by more than 15 points, and Egyptian rose by five or six points. Yesterday's exchange rate was not much different. The price of legal tender and foreign cotton increased by four yuan per picul compared to before the holiday.

Domestic Foreign Cotton Transactions: Although all factories in the local market have fully resumed work today, the price of yarn on the red market rose by another four or five yuan yesterday, with transactions of several thousand bales. However, foreign cotton transactions showed a sluggish trend. This may be due to the firm refusal of various Chinese factories to order foreign cotton. However, it is widely rumored that Shenxin is currently secretly ordering hundreds of bales of Brazilian cotton from a certain Brazilian cotton import foreign firm. The payment terms are to pay a deposit of 10% first, and the remaining 90% will be paid after the ship arrives at the port, and then another 10% deposit. Although the amount is small, if this happens, the interests of the industry should also be considered. If all Chinese factories can always unite and take collective action, and have the spirit of "rather stop work if necessary and refuse to buy foreign cotton," all foreign firms will succumb. The spot market price and transaction volume yesterday are listed below:

Yesterday's Transaction Volume

Gongda: Imported 300 bales of Indian cotton

Tongyu: Imported 200 bales of Indian cotton

Yu: Imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton

Neiwai: Imported 300 bales of American cotton

Foreign Cotton Converted Market Price Listed Below

### Sugar Market: Shantou Fine White Sugar Prices are Shouted High

Yesterday the sugar market trend was stable. The association's price for 24-Dutch coarse white re-export goods was 16 yuan and 25 cents for 400 bales. There was no change in spot goods. Taikoo Car White B Mark in Puxi Wharf was 24 yuan. Although the price of domestic Shantou fine white sugar was shouted up, no transaction was made. Odd white sugar was still opened at 18 yuan and 50 cents to 17 yuan and 50 cents, 100 bales of Zhiyang sugar were 15 yuan and 40 cents, high-quality goods were called at 16 yuan, and over a hundred bales of Jue Shantou red sugar were opened at 12 yuan and 78 cents. Dozens of bales of Donghai red sugar were 12 yuan. Several thousand bales of ordinary Huanggang green sugar were opened at 11 yuan and 67 cents, Longgang green sugar was 10 yuan and 20 cents, and Xinghua sugar opened Mingjing red sugar, a total of more than 500 bales, at 14 yuan and 30 cents. The original price of Diaoqing sugar did not rise or fall, and it continued to be offered. It is said that new goods are difficult to price due to production costs, and there is still a lack of shipping to Shanghai. However, today 1,000 bales of sugar are coming from Hong Kong to Qingdao.

### Grain: Spot Flour Sales are Strong Only in the North; Wheat Owners Raise Prices

Flour yesterday was the first trading day of the year. During the New Year holiday, in addition to repairing machinery, various factories also made a small amount of preparation for domestic wheat raw materials. Therefore, the production volume has increased slightly compared to before. However, the stock of flour is still insufficient, and there is still a lack of large-scale supply. The market price is gradually being shouted higher. Customers dislike the high price and do not intend to buy more. As a result, over 30,000 bags of Green Battleship, Green Cannon, Red Blue Car and other No. 2 flour were sold at a price of 4 yuan and 90 cents, an increase of 5 cents compared to the previous market. Except for 8,000 bags of retail sales in this street, the majority were from the northern gangs, and the southern gangs decided. There are still 15,000 to 16,000 bags of Red God of Wealth and Red Peach Blossom, priced at 4 yuan and 35 cents, and 3,000 to 4,000 bags of Red Blue Fisherman, priced at 4 yuan and 45 cents, all of which were handled by Tianjin and Qinhuangdao and other places. Broken flour is out of stock and there is no market.

Wheat has been arriving daily. During the four-day holiday, over 40,000 bags arrived, most of which were directly allocated to factories. The price was similar to the closing price at the end of the year. Therefore, there are not many sellers on the market, and the price of flour is also high, so the owners are raising prices even more fiercely. As a result, the price is 4 or 5 cents higher than last year's market. It is estimated that Fuxin Factory bought 10,000 bags, and Fu Factory bought 5,000 bags. The highest price of Jiangbei wheat has reached 6 yuan and 65 cents.

### Japonica Rice Sales Become Sluggish

Yesterday's source of domestic rice: a total of four ships arrived at Hexia, and 6,000 to 7,000 bags of original packages were transported from Baimao and Hupukou. This street and hoarders rarely inquire about them, so people's minds are more stable, and various goods show a trend of oversupply. Customers are thinking of making prices lower, but sellers are struggling to maintain prices due to the heavy cost of the goods that have arrived. Therefore, although japonica rice transactions are not large, Hou Bo japonica rice has only weakened slightly by a few cents. Duyang Jianbu and Jianjian should be in equal demand and have not seen gains or losses. Yin is again out of stock, and Bianyuan is uniquely popular due to the lack of loans, standing out by a few cents.

Today, 4,050 bags of rice were exported, shipped from Hong Kong and transshipped to Tianjin, and another 2,290 bags came from Hong Kong and were transshipped to Qingdao.

### Piece Goods: Sichuan and Yunnan are Actively Procuring Spring Goods; Business in Hunan and Jiangxi is Gradually Recovering; Large-Scale Purchases are Also Being Made in Wenzhou and Taizhou

The domestic cloth market opened yesterday for the New Year. The industry generally expects prices to rise, and hoarders intend to hoard more. The selling prices of various goods are all trending upward. Especially the fine cloth and fine twill produced by Shenxin and Shui'an factories are attracting the most speculation, increasing by 2 to 4 dimes per bolt. Coarse cloth is flat. Lunchang floral cloth, satin, and blue cloth have also increased by 1 or 2 dimes. As our army's positions in Hunan and Jiangxi are stable, business is gradually recovering, so they are also focusing on large-scale purchases from Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou. Demand for fine cloth is particularly strong. Transactions include white fine cloth and fine twill, over 500 pieces of coarse cloth, over 200 boxes of printed cloth, dyed cloth, and printed piece goods. Wenzhou and Taizhou gangs are also handling over 300 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. Wholesale hoarders in this port are also in good demand. Transactions include floral cloth and blue cloth produced by Lunchang Factory, which are transshipped to Zhejiang and Jiangxi inland through Wenzhou. Changde gangs are hoarding over 100 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Sichuan and Yunnan gangs have transacted 2,000 bolts of light-colored spring goods such as Piao cloth, poplin, foreign yarn, colored tribute, and standard cloth. Although Hong Kong and Shantou gangs have added purchases of general merchandise, the prices are too high, so they are still hesitant. Orders for various goods are still popular. Due to the need to re-establish import registration procedures, shipments from the Fujian gang are temporarily suspended, but mail is still being sent.

The morning market for Eastern goods was flat and sluggish, but in the afternoon, due to brisk actual sales, the market became tighter. Fine cloth and fine twill increased by about 5 to 7.5 cents per bolt compared to the end of last year. Fine cloth of the Longtou, Caiqiu, and Yanghe brands sold for 10 yuan 85 cents to 90 cents. Transactions between industry insiders and customers amounted to about 2,000 pieces. Foreign firms also opened nearly 1,000 pieces. 12-pound Feiyu fine cloth was ordered at 10 yuan, Longtou Caiqiu at 10 yuan 95 cents, Shuangyu at 10 yuan 5 cents, and Laba Tong at 10 yuan 55 cents, all more than 5 cents higher than the market price, so the market trend is firm.

### Oil Cake: Yantai and Qixia are the Most Expensive

Soybean oil and peanut oil have both increased by 2 dimes, which is due to the healthy purchasing demand during the five-day holiday. However, foreign firms are still selling, so the overall market trend depends on whether the market sales can be smooth today. Yesterday, this street transacted 50 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil (see the market price column for行情). 340 cans of Ningbo green peanut oil went to Qingdao, 300 barrels of Dalian soybean oil are available now, and 70 barrels are scheduled for delivery in the first ten days of January, 50 barrels in the last ten days of January, and 400 barrels will be sold by foreign firms in the first ten days of February. Spot transactions of current oil amounted to 30 barrels, and 200 barrels are scheduled for delivery in the last ten days of January. In addition, 100 pieces of Yantai and Qixia oil were opened, and the market price rose by 4 dimes, and 100 pieces were also made for delivery within ten days.

### North-South Goods: The Rising Trend of Golden Needles Turns Stable

Golden needles: as the source has arrived, the strong rising trend has gradually flattened, and the demand from Hong Kong and Guangdong gangs has also slightly decreased. The opening price of the firms is slightly looser than before, and there have not been many transactions in recent days. The higher market prices are 34 to 35 yuan, followed by 31 yuan to 24 to 25 yuan, which vary. Additional costs are added for those with good quality, plump body, bright color, and a thousand-piece body.

### Medicinal Materials: Gual鳞甲片 Becomes Slightly Softer After Rising

鱗甲票 is scarce, so the market has repeatedly risen. High-quality goods were intended to rise to 260 yuan per picul, followed by 230 yuan. Until now, the outbound route has been reduced, but the source is still felt, and the bottom stock is also rare, so it has presented a stable appearance.

### Returning Guest

— Qiu Zhushi

The wind and snow are heavy, the firewood door at dusk.

Desolate old ferry

A returning guest from thousands of miles away is mooring.

Around a circle of fences, still

Citrus protects the cold smoke;

Recognize the owner's house, the wandering dragon grass is scattered

——A dim lintel.

A string of tears mixed with a string of heartbeats,

Ten thousand miles of shoes gnaw at the green moss on the steps,

Returning from the sky full of flames,

And calmly knocked on the peaceful firewood door of the home.

White hair fluttering,

Faintly seen in a dream.

However, there is a shadow of a lamp on the screen wall,

Giving the surprised old tears a glimmer of silver.

Shining on the plain wall, this familiar plain wall, the lamp

Blooms in the red flames.

(The blooming lamp illuminates the blooming heart of the mother.)

Listen to the returning guest's thrilling narration,

Mother, washing away the year's fatigue and hardship.

"The mountain car went crazy,

Circling the verdant peaks.

Here, you can call God and tell him,

Say: There is a group of refugees

Lambs begging for mercy.

However, God is sleeping peacefully at his desk,

The wild eagle is laying eggs in the higher sky."

Listening to these,

Like listening to ancient fairy tales,

The mother's ancient heart extracts fear:

The twentieth century is said to be a civilized world,

Who is it, who is playing cruel old tricks?

However, the mother is temporarily happy after all,

Because the desolate old ferry

A returning guest from thousands of miles away is mooring.

The wind and snow are heavy, the firewood door at dusk.

### Iron Current

— Situ Zong

——In Memory of Warrior Zhou Dagen

Squad leader Zhou Dagen's face was red as he faced the staff officer:

"This is not child's play, you have to consider it carefully!"

As soon as the words came out, Dagen immediately felt that it was not quite right; this did not sound like something he would say! In the long ten years of fighting against the evil forces in the past, he had never said weak words at all! What's more, it was at this emergency moment. The other party's two sharp eyes were pressing on him tightly, and a faint smile was revealed on his long face!

"Please don't misunderstand!" Dagen quickly made a correction to his own words: "This is not a consideration of whether to do it or not, but a careful consideration of the method!"

Really, to do it, Dagen had long thought it was not a problem! Perhaps it was because he was preparing to do it painfully at all times that he caused this decision! The jealousy of friendly troops, the attention of the enemy, perhaps because of the fact that he was actually doing it.

As soon as Dagen thought of doing it, his whole body was filled with heat, and a new force seemed to come to his iron-like arms. However, dividing the only hundred or so comrades into two groups to meet the enemy seemed to be a problem worth considering.

"Consideration..." Dagen dragged out two words so lightly again; at the same time, he aimed his painful eyes at the staff officer, as if expecting the staff officer's understanding.

In fact, the staff officer would never misunderstand. There was already a chain-like connection between hearts, and suspicion would never play a role in their idleness!

"Right?" The staff officer said with a smile: "The strength is weak?"

Dagen nodded quickly, and his heart seemed to lighten a lot.

"But," the staff officer continued, "since the enemy is coming in separate ways, we have to meet the enemy in separate ways, could it be..."

"No, please don't say it!" Dagen roared loudly: "Could it be that we are willing to escape and retreat!"

This will never happen. In Dagen, in the staff officer, and in the hearts of more than one hundred comrades, such an idea will never arise. This is the time to correct the psychology of the people with action! Let the people know that although there is a dark side in the guerrilla area, it is also making bright progress at the same time!

The arrangement was completed in a very short time. More than one hundred comrades carried excited and nervous hearts, and at the same time, each of their hearts was filled with anger. When they crawled through the grass in the pouring rain, they were so angry that their whole bodies cramped. The enemy would be so familiar with such a winding path! This is not, this is not... Alas!

"Traitors! Traitors..." Everyone gritted their teeth.

A series of undulating cemeteries became their fortresses; two light machine guns served as their bodies, and they excitedly shouted loudly to everyone:

"Prepare! Hold on to our guns! The south is already in contact!"

However, there was no movement in the east here. Ten minutes, twenty minutes, this was really difficult time to endure! Listening to the roar of other people's gunfire, the comrades here were a little itchy. Especially Dagen, who was even more full of anxiety. Until the gunfire in the south slowly subsided, and no enemy traces were found here.

"This, this, could it be that the enemy is concentrating in one place,...then, maybe they won't be able to stop it!... "

The cessation of gunfire in the south brought even more unease and worry to Dagen. He could no longer be the vanguard of the southeast and east roads; Dagen and the staff officer took on the command of the two roads.

The rain had already soaked through their thin clothes, and the wind was blowing even harder. Dagen was hurriedly inspecting every fortress, forgetting that the raindrops on his head were pouring straight down his face. When he walked in front of every comrade lying behind the grave, he always squatted down and patted the wet shoulder:

"Comrade, don't miss this opportunity!"

Only when a determined smile appeared on the black and fat face that was lifted up, he could switch to another one with peace of mind...

Suddenly, there were a few sporadic gunshots from the south, but then there was a dense roar of machine guns. Dagen immediately lay down and waited quietly. He jumped up and whispered:

"Be careful, I'll go take a look!"

He nimbly went to the side of the river. He quickly waved his arms, wanting to greet the comrades lying behind the graves, preparing to intercept the enemy across the river.

But, "Bang!"

A bullet hit his chest right in the front. A burst of pain almost knocked him to the ground. He quickly pressed his chest with his hand and turned back to run and shout into the woods, but he did not run more than three steps. The second bullet had already hit his head.

At this moment, the staff officer also brought his troops from the south, and the comrades lying behind the graves had also jumped up.

"Retreat to the north!" This was the staff officer's order.

But what answered him was a roar of charge; an iron current jumped over Dagen's corpse and rushed to the riverside...

### Talking About "Name" Again

— Chi Qiang

Let's talk about "name" again this time.

Let's talk about the old saying: "If the name is not correct, then the words will not be fluent;..."

This should be an oriental-style cliché, but unexpectedly, Hitler also greeted this cliché from afar, and did his best.

The annexation of Austria and the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and even the rest, seemed to seek the largest common denominator in these different figures, and spoke loudly:

"Nation and state!" "The issue of ethnic minorities!"

What a resounding and pleasant term! After such a "rectification of name", it would naturally be much easier to do, and the world would have to look at it with sidelong glances.

The methods are as spicy as they may be, and the presentation is as roaring as it may be, but after all, there is a bit of... undoubtedly a bit of guarding against the "Spring and Autumn Annals straight pen".

"I can't help but be annoyed, what should I do?"

"I have an idea! Let me set up a soul-stirring formation," so:

"Referendum!"

Very pretty, magnificent! These "manageable" masses are first caught in hand.

Post-event investigation shows that this term, apart from being used when the Sudetenland issue arose in Czechoslovakia, was also replicated in South Africa's mandated territory of Southwest Africa. What about after that? Where to go from there?

In the trend of terms that have never had national borders, I especially feel the crisis after these kinds of terms are unfortunately "spread eastward" this time.

Will our country catch a cold and have a fever? This depends entirely on how strong the "antidote" hidden within itself is.

However, from "Imperial Way" to "Paradise" (?), a chorus of "Asia" and "Asia" arose, and there were even "new systems", "new orders", and "peace", "harmony"... and the like, all with great names and novel patterns, which were abundant and filled the ears, were they not beautiful!

China has always attached importance to "rectifying names", and this matter is extremely important and cannot be taken lightly. If you are not careful, when you want to clean it up, the difficulty is equal to "prying stones down the mountain", and there is no place to use your strength.

Losing a few cities is not uncommon; even scorched earth will grow new seedlings. Only people – unruly people! The hooks and snares that confuse the public with names must be analyzed clearly; what kind of medicine is sold in that gourd? Propaganda under false pretenses should be corrected or refuted outright.

This is not a pedantic "caviling over words", but the first mountain-opening axe to prevent problems before they occur. All enlightened people should come and deliberate, and it is imperative to strive for it. "When drinking water, think of the source", "Name! Name! "Taking care of name" most important is to "think of meaning"; especially when she is about to "sheath the sword and cultivate literature".

At this time, perhaps the "sugar coating" is layered on top of each other!

### How to Choose a Topic

— Zi Qing

Generally speaking, we people who like to write articles always feel that there is no story to write when we pick up a pen, and we don’t know where to start. In other words, we can’t find a suitable “topic” to write about.

Yes, the value and us of a work are closely related to the object of description – the topic. It can make people have a deep resonance after reading or describing it, as if the story written is completely the reader's own story, this function relies on how to choose the "topic". Then, the question of "how to choose a topic" should and must be raised before every author.

The question of "choosing a topic", first of all, I think what needs to be understood is to know the variability of the times and the environment. For example, in the current period of the War of Resistance, the topics we want to write about cannot be separated from various life descriptions that are beneficial to the "War of Resistance", otherwise, even if it is published, it is equivalent to a waste of paper to the reader, so that the reader cannot deeply appreciate it, and even makes people hate it! If we describe some stories related to the War of Resistance, such as the lives of soldiers on the front line, the rescue and propaganda work of patriotic young men and women who are active in various places, or the encounters of refugees in the rear and occupied areas, and the portrayal of various vicious killings and looting by the enemy, we only need to apply these living topics well, and we can enable general readers to obtain a "sense of reality", and deeply sympathize and resonate, and even inspire readers to participate in various tasks that are beneficial to the "War of Resistance". Therefore, to say that a work that makes people deeply meaningful, first of all, we must pay attention to whether its topic is in line with the times.

Secondly, what we want to think of is not to forget the "authenticity" of the story. Because only under the abstract consciousness of conforming to the times, if we do not carefully measure the authenticity of the topic, this will not increase the value of the work. For example, to describe the refugees in the refugees, if you have not experienced the authenticity of the refugee life, only from the fragments of news obtained from third parties or various aspects, and you pick up a pen to write a piece together, this is simply a joke, and it has no impact on the facts. Therefore, to choose a topic, we must also pay attention to its authenticity.

Finally, we must pay attention to how to organize this topic. Because the factual facts, reflected in the subjective consciousness, are still fragmented stories. To connect them into a systematic story, we have to organize them, so that it is in line with science, so that readers can get a deep impression after reading it, and not spend too much time.

Dear writers, I put forward this question, hoping that it will become a reference for your writing.

### New Year Talk on Auspicious Marriage (Part 1)

— Factory

Every New Year's Day, various theaters in Beiping would stage auspicious new plays, such as "Drunken Concubine," "A Bed Full of Tablets" (i.e., "Beating the Golden Branch"), "The Imperial Stele Pavilion," and "Auspicious Marriage," among others. Some were chosen for their auspicious names, others for their happy endings. Overall, the intention was to bring good luck to the audience at the beginning of the year. In Beiping, on New Year's Day, Mei Lanfang loved to sing "Drunken Concubine" or "The Imperial Stele Pavilion," Shang Xiaoyun loved to perform "A Bed Full of Tablets," and there were three famous actors who loved to perform "Auspicious Marriage": Xun Huisheng, one of the four great Dan actors; Xiao Cuihua, the leading Hua Dan; and Zhu Qinxin, an amateur-turned-professional. I have seen all three of their performances of "Auspicious Marriage" because I particularly loved this play and saw it more than once. I won't go into detail about their different artistic styles. Now, let me first discuss the structure of the play and the expressions that should be displayed in the performance! The story of "Auspicious Marriage" is as follows: Scholar Mo Ji's house was destroyed by fire, and he was reduced to begging. One day, in the cold and snow, Mo Ji, suffering from hunger and cold, collapsed at the gate of Jin Song, the leader of the beggars. Jin was out at the time, and his daughter Yu Nu heard a collapsing sound outside the door and went out to see Mo Ji. Yu Nu, feeling sorry for him, gave him some leftover food and a bowl of bean juice, which saved his life. When Old Jin returned, he learned that Mo was a scholar and saw that Yu Nu admired him, so he betrothed Yu Nu to him. After they got married, the young couple was very loving. However, Yu Nu had great ambitions and did not want to beg all the time, so she persuaded Mo to seek fame. Later, Mo took Jin and his daughter to the capital to take the exam. Along the way, Mo focused on his studies, while Old Jin begged everywhere to feed his talented son-in-law. After the results were announced, Mo unexpectedly passed and was appointed magistrate. Old Jin and his daughter were rejoicing when Mo changed his mind, fearing that he would be ridiculed for having a beggar wife. On the way to his post, he plotted to push Yu Nu into the water and drove Old Jin away. After Yu Nu fell into the water, she was rescued by Examiner Lin, who took her in as his adopted daughter. Yu Nu explained what had happened, and Examiner Lin was furious at Mo Ji's actions and promised to avenge her. Coincidentally, Mo Ji was Examiner Lin's son-in-law. After they met, Examiner Lin asked him if he had a wife. To marry into a high-ranking family, he kept silent about his past. Examiner Lin then married his daughter (who was actually Yu Nu) to him. On their wedding night, filled with joy, he entered the room and realized that she was his former wife, Yu Nu. He was ashamed, and Yu Nu ordered the servants to beat him. With Examiner Lin's mediation, they reconciled. At that time, Old Jin also found his way to their post, and the whole family celebrated their reunion. From the story of this play, it is clear that it is dedicated to depicting the consequences of being ungrateful due to excessive vanity. In terms of structure, it is extremely tight. The protagonist is, of course, Jin Yu Nu. Playing this role should be divided into several periods and several attitudes.

### Believe It or Not: Fat Daughter Zhu Nianzhen Is Only Eight Years Old This Year and Weighs 150 Pounds. If She Were in Hollywood, She Would Have Been Hired as an Actress Long Ago.

— Tianma

"We originally lived in Hongzhen. We fled here because of the Japanese war!"

Her father wasn't found. Upstairs in a fruit store on Jiujiang Road, a chubby, short girl was speaking very lively in front of a stranger.

"Who says she's only eight years old? Look at her size! A thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy is in the first grade. The homeroom teacher's surname is Yan. Everyone stares at me when I go out on the street, it's really annoying."

Wearing an Indanthrene-dyed shirt and a thick silver ring around her neck, her hair was not long, but the parted peach-shaped buns were neatly combed. Her stature was more than three feet tall, and her waist was very thick. She said:

"I suddenly started gaining weight at six years old. Children were only that size at that age. What's even stranger is her face. If I hadn't known she was a girl, I wouldn't have been able to guess that she wasn't a boy."

When she saw me, and I mentioned that I came specifically to see her, she was overcome by a girl's shyness and ran inside. However, after hearing the visitor's kind and friendly conversation, she came out to talk more familiarly.

"I studied at Huaming Primary School before the war, and now it's the Lian Primary School on Fourth Horse Road. Although I've never been thin since I was little, I now weigh 150 pounds, which is 105 catties on the Chinese scale, but I only eat two big bowls of rice!"

Judging by her expression, she was quite alert and intelligent, and certainly not as weak as an eight-year-old girl. She went to get a photo and picked up a pen to write her name, hardly any different from a thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy.

This child is quite clever. At first glance, she reminded people of the singer Yin Xiucen, because her face and the flesh under her jaw were very similar. If she were in Hollywood, such a rare child would surely have been hired at a high price by managers who specialize in collecting curiosities to make movies for film companies.

Her mother is sick, and her father is on duty at the police station. She has to go in to serve them urgently. Her neighbor told me that she is from Xuzhou, and her father, Zhu Chiqing, is an investigator at the Central Police Station, but I think her Shanghai dialect and Xuzhou dialect are both quite good.

Wireless Radio Cinema Completed

The success of wireless image transmission can be said to be a world-shaking and great invention in science. Recently, the British Gaumont Film Company specially invested 5 million pounds to convert the Dumining Film Experimental Field under its jurisdiction into a Royal Wireless Radio Cinema. The British government has also made a large amount of donations to join. The person in charge is John Felrdia, the inventor of broadcast film, who has completed the test after thirty-three trials. It is heard that the screen for playing movies is only ten inches high and fourteen inches wide. In this way, images can be transmitted on a wireless motor that is a thousand times larger. It is estimated that it will be ready for opening in the autumn of 1939. From then on, you can sit at home and watch movies.

It is still a novel story that foreign actors are being excluded in Hollywood.

### Tianjin Theater News

— Chan Weng

On the 27th of last month, the Tianjin Lions Club hosted a charity performance for winter relief. It was held at the Chinese Theater. The most exciting performances included Shang Heyu's "Yanyang Tower," Xiao Cuihua's "Drunken Concubine," Jin Shaoshan's "Bai Liangguan," and Ma Lianliang, Zhang Junqiu, and Ma Jinglu's full version of "Qingfeng Pavilion." Because there were too many plays, it took too long to perform. "Qingfeng Pavilion" was only performed until "Looking for a Son" and then stopped. Following "The Bridal Sedan Chair Takes Wukong," Li Wanchun continued to arrange "The Monkey King's Birth and Apprenticeship to Bodhi" and "The Eighteen Arhats Subdue the Great Peng," two excerpts. Recently, the music circles of Pingjin have been extremely welcoming of monkey operas. In addition to Li Wanchun, Li Shaochun, Sun Yukun, Yang Shengchun, Liu Zongyang, Shang Changchun, and others are all using Sun Wukong as a means of attracting audiences.

Yan Jupeng recently stayed in Tianjin for performances. On New Year's Day in the new calendar, he performed at the Chinese Theater. Jupeng's son, Shaopeng, and daughter, Huizhu, also appeared on stage at the same time. Jupeng specially invited the famous Huqin player Guo Shaochen to play the strings for his daughter to add color to the performance.

Since Mao Shilai performed "Killing a Son for Revenge," the attendance has been quite good. Now, Yang Yunpu has given him the script for "The Honeycomb Story," which is currently in rehearsal. According to reports, "The Honeycomb Story" is a secret script that has disappeared from the opera stage. The content is fiery and the plot is tense, surpassing "Killing a Son for Revenge" in excitement. It is expected that its first performance will cause another sensation.

Screen Horse Against Center Cannon (Sideways Chariot Method)

Yesterday's published methods were explained:

Pawn 3 Advances 1, intending to wait for an opportunity to move; Chariot 1 Advances 1, then the black Chariot 9 Moves to 8, which seems to be an unnecessary move. Therefore, Horse 2 Advances 3, Pawn 7 Advances 1, opening the Horse path. Even if the red Chariot prohibits the Horse on the third road, it cannot prohibit the seventh road. Horse 8 Advances 7, using the coiled-head flanked Horse Cannon formation, with the intention of attacking the central road. Cannon 8 Advances 2, which can defend the central road, preventing the opponent from advancing rashly, and Horse 3 Advances 4, preparing to capture the Chariot. Chariot 6 Moves to 7 to suppress the Horse, Chariot 1 Moves to 3, conveniently bringing out the Chariot, and secretly hiding the capture of the Chariot. If the Chariot is allowed to be taken, then Chariot 6 Moves to 7 is the same as not moving, and the red side gains the initiative while the black side loses the initiative. If we calculate the number of moves at this time, the player who moves second has eight steps, while the player who moves first only has six steps. In an even game for initiative, there seems to be no difference of two steps. According to the situation in this game, Chariot 6 Advances 5, changing to Pawn 5 Advances 1, then the forces are evenly matched. Although the victory or defeat is undecided, the opening is such that a considerable advantage is gained.

Opening Game Method, Game 2, Black Moves First

### Secret History of the Forbidden Garden in the Old Capital (6) (6)

Lun Hears Shu Yan Tune His Voice

Jupeng and Chen are both Tan school old sheng actors who started halfway, so they naturally don't have the skills in their waists and legs. Jupeng's problem is that he "likes to stick out his small belly," while Chen "likes to hunch his back and raise his buttocks high." Therefore, Shu Yan joked with them, "It's best to have Chen cross-dress as Cao Cao and perform 'Catch and Release' with Jupeng. When the two of them come on stage together, one in front and one behind, their stage walk looks quite good." Little Yu's mouth is really good at criticizing people; people say that he has no son (only two daughters) because he lacks moral integrity.

Shu Yan's wife, née Chen (daughter of Delin), passed away four years ago. Only at the funeral did he feel the lack of a son in front of the coffin, not even someone to wear mourning clothes. He felt truly desolate and full of regrets. He was usually proud and unwilling to take apprentices. Although Yang Baozhong had formally apprenticed to him, he refused to acknowledge it. As for the other fake Yu school old sheng actors, there was even less to say. Who knew that Shu Yan's wife's death would create an opportunity for those fake disciples? Everyone saw Shu Yan's thoughts and hurriedly made mourning clothes, practically wearing the heavy mourning clothes of a disciple. By the time the funeral procession arrived, Baozhong, Maisen, Fuying, Shaolou, and Shaolin (considered a brother-in-law and a disciple) were arranged at the head of the coffin as if they had received an imperial decree, seeming more authorized than those who had truly served as ancestors. In this way, no matter how stubborn Shu Yan was, he could not erase the facts. Therefore, he later saw through worldly affairs somewhat and opened the door of convenience. As a result, female actor Meng Xiaodong often went to Yu's house to ask for instruction. Now, Li Shaochun has formally apprenticed to him. Shu Yan, who had always insisted on not accepting insider disciples, has now greatly changed his mind.

His personality was very lonely in the previous years. He usually didn't go out much. When he was at home, besides his family of four (wife and two daughters), there were also two friends who often visited and a Qin master who came every day.
